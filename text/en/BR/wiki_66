<text>The Household Cavalry (HCAV) is a corps of the Household Division that is made up of the two most senior regiments of the British Army – The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons). They have taken part in every major conflict since 1660. These regiments are divided between the Household Cavalry Regiment stationed at Wing Barracks in Wiltshire, with an armored reconnaissance role, and the ceremonial mounted unit, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, garrisoned at Hyde Park Barracks in London. Both the HCMR and HCR are made up of elements of the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals. The Household Cavalry is part of the Household Division and is the King&#x27;s official bodyguard. Although the Household Cavalry Regiment is armoured, it is not part of the Royal Armoured Corps, being assigned to the Household Division.

== Regiments ==

The Household Cavalry is classed as a corps in its own right, and consists of two regiments: The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons). They are the senior regular regiments in the British Army, with traditions dating from 1660, and act as the King&#x27;s personal bodyguard. They are the cavalry element of the guards regiments and, with the five foot guard regiments, constitute the seven guards regiments of the Household Division.

== Organisation ==
Below is the structure of the regiment:

* Household Cavalry Regiment, at Powle Lines, Bulford Camp (Armoured Reconnaissance)
** Regimental Headquarters
** Headquarters Squadron
** A Squadron
** C Squadron
** D Squadron
* Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, at Hyde Park Barracks, London (Ceremonial, mounted duties at Horse Guards, London)
** Regimental Headquarters
** Headquarters Squadron
*** Winter Training Troop
*** Forge and Veterinary Department
*** Household Cavalry Training Wing, at Combermere Barracks, Windsor
** The Life Guards Squadron
** The Blues and Royals Squadron

The Household Cavalry as a whole is split into two different units that fulfil very distinct roles. These are both joint units, consisting of personnel from both regiments. Like other Cavalry formations, the Household Cavalry is divided into regiments (battalion-sized units) and squadrons (company-sized sub-units). The whole corps is under the command of the Commander Household Cavalry (formerly Colonel Commanding The Household Cavalry), who also holds the Royal Household appointment of Silver Stick in Waiting. He is a Colonel and is assisted by a retired lieutenant colonel as Regimental Adjutant.
The Household Cavalry Regiment (HCR) has an active operational role as a Formation Reconnaissance Regiment, serving in armoured fighting vehicles including the Warrior and Ajax, operating far ahead of the main body of friendly forces. Their role is to locate and report on the movement and disposition of enemy forces, and engage and destroy enemy reconnaissance elements that are seeking to do do the same. The regiment forms one of five formation reconnaissance regiments in the British Army&#x27;s order of battle. The HCR has four operational squadrons, three of which are traditional medium reconnaissance squadrons equipped with the Warrior and Ajax armoured fighting vehicles, and the fourth is referred to as Command and Support Squadron and includes specialists, such as Forward Air Controllers. One of HCR&#x27;s squadrons has been assigned to the airborne role, supporting 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team, since 2003. The regiment was formerly based at Combermere Barracks, Windsor, one mile from Windsor Castle, until its move to Bulford Camp, Wiltshire, in May 2019. The members of the Household Division have sometimes been required to undertake special tasks as the Sovereign&#x27;s personal troops. The Household Cavalry were called to Windsor Castle on 20 November 1992 to assist with salvage operations following the 1992 Windsor Castle fire.
The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment (HCMR) is horsed and carries out mounted (and some dismounted) ceremonial duties on State and Royal occasions. These include the provision of a Sovereign&#x27;s Escort, most commonly seen on The King&#x27;s Birthday Parade (Trooping the Colour) in June each year. Other occasions include state visits by visiting heads of state, royal weddings, coronations, or whenever required by the British monarch, including ceremonies associated with the Death and state funeral of Elizabeth II. The regiment also mounts the King&#x27;s Life Guard at Horse Guards. HCMR consists of one squadron from The Life Guards, one from The Blues and Royals and a squadron called Headquarters Squadron, which is responsible for all administrative matters and includes the regimental headquarters (RHQ), the Riding Staff, Farriers, Tailors and Saddlers. The Regiment has been based (in various forms) at Hyde Park Barracks, Knightsbridge, since 1795. New troopers and officers are generally first assigned to London upon completion of horsemanship training, referred to, alongside the rest of HCMR personnel, as Mounted Dutymen, and remain there for up to three years. Like the five Foot Guards regiments they rotate between the operational and ceremonial roles.

=== King&#x27;s Life Guard ===
The Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment provides the King&#x27;s Life Guard, the mounted guard at the entrance to Horse Guards. Horse Guards is the official main entrance to both St James&#x27;s Palace and Buckingham Palace. The guard is on horseback from 10 am until 4 pm, with the two sentries changing every hour. From 4 pm until 8 pm a pair of dismounted sentries remain. At 8 pm, the gates of Horse Guards are locked, and a single sentry remains until 7 am. When the King is in London, the Guard consists of one officer, one corporal major (who carries the standard), two non-commissioned officers, one trumpeter and ten troopers. This is known as a &quot;long guard.&quot; When the King is not resident in London, the Guard is reduced to two non-commissioned officers and ten troopers. This is known as a &quot;short guard.&quot; Responsibility for mounting the guard alternates between The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals. Every summer, the King&#x27;s Troop, Royal Horse Artillery takes over the role, while the HCMR conducts important regimental training outside of London.

== Ranks ==
=== Officers ===
Second Lieutenants in The Blues and Royals are known as Cornets.

=== NCOs and other ranks ===
The rank names and insignia of non-commissioned officers in the Household Cavalry are unique in the British Army:

Recruits were required to have a very high moral character. Before the Second World War, recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 10 inches tall, but could not exceed 6 feet 1 inch. They initially enlisted for eight years with the colours and a further four years with the reserve.

== Army farriers ==

There is a farrier on call twenty-four hours a day, at Hyde Park Barracks.

Farriers traditionally combined veterinary knowledge with blacksmiths&#x27; skills. They were responsible for hoof trimming and fitting horseshoes to horses. They also dealt with the &quot;humane dispatch of wounded and sick horses&quot;, accomplished with the large spike on the end of their axes. Then they used the sharp blade of the axe to chop off the deceased animal&#x27;s hoof, which was marked with its regimental number. This assisted in keeping track of animals killed in action.

Although the axes are not used any more, army farriers still carry these axes, with their characteristic highly polished blade and spike, at ceremonial events such as Trooping the Colour.

In The Blues and Royals, the farriers dress like their comrades in regimental uniform. The distinctive uniform and equipment of the farriers of The Life Guards—blue tunic, black plume and axe—is a historic reminder of the old British Army of the days of James Wolfe. Every cavalry regiment in the Army, other than the Royal Horse Guards (The Blues), originally wore scarlet for all ranks, except the farriers. Farriers were garbed invariably in sombre blue and bore axes, worn at the side, like the swords of their comrades. When on parade, the troopers drew swords, the Farriers drew axes and carried them at the &quot;Advance&quot;.

Following every parade is a duty horse-box, known as the Veterinary Aid Post, with a specialist emergency team in attendance.

== Band ==

The Mounted Band of the Household Cavalry was a merger in 2014 of the 35 piece Band of The Blues and Royals and the 35 piece Band of The Life Guards. They are now one band of 64 musicians but wear the uniform of both The Blues and Royals and The Life Guards. They come under RCAM, the Royal Corps of Army Music. They also provide State Trumpeters for events of state.

== Musical Ride ==
The Musical Ride of the Mounted Regiments of the Household Cavalry was first performed at the Royal Tournament in 1882. The two trumpeters sitting on grey horses were historically intended to form a contrast with the darker horses, so that they could be seen on battlefields when relaying officers&#x27; commands to the troops. The troops weave around the trumpeters and the celebrated drumhorse, Spartacus.

== Order of precedence ==
In the British Army Order of Precedence, the Household Cavalry is always listed first and always parades at the extreme right of the line, save in cases that the guns of the Royal Horse Artillery are to be first in line during parades.


== Notable incidents ==
In April 2024, after being spooked by falling concrete during their daily morning exercise, five horses unseated their riders and went on a panicked flight through central London. Colliding with vehicles and pedestrians, two of the horses suffered serious injuries. Three soldiers were among those injured and were taken to hospital.

== The Household Cavalry Foundation ==
The Household Cavalry is supported by the Household Cavalry Foundation, the regimental charity, which raises funds in aid of five core themes: casualties, veterans, serving soldiers, horses and heritage.

== The Household Cavalry Regiment Museum ==

The Household Cavalry has two museums. The Household Cavalry Museum is located at Horse Guards Parade in central London, where the HCMR mounts the King&#x27;s Life Guard. The museum is a very popular tourist attraction with digital audio guides in several languages. The museum includes a window into the working stables of the King&#x27;s Life Guard, allowing visitors to watch ongoing care of the horses throughout the day. Separately, the Household Cavalry Regiment has its own museum at Combermere Barracks in Windsor. A volunteer team organise tours and events and, in particular, administer the regiment&#x27;s extensive material, documentary and photographic archives. The museum is open to public groups, by appointment.

<text>The Treaty of Amsterdam, officially the Treaty of Amsterdam amending the Treaty on European Union, the Treaties establishing the European Communities and certain related acts, was signed on 2 October 1997, and entered into force on 1 May 1999; it made substantial changes to the Treaty of Maastricht, which had been signed in 1992.

Under the Treaty of Amsterdam, member states agreed to transfer certain powers from national governments to the European Parliament across diverse areas, including legislating on immigration, adopting civil and criminal laws, and enacting common foreign and security policy (CFSP), as well as implementing institutional changes for expansion as new member nations join the EU.

==Background==
The treaty was the result of long negotiations which began in Messina, Italy, on 2 June 1995, nearly forty years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome, and reached completion in Amsterdam on 18 June 1997. Following the formal signing of the Treaty on 2 October 1997, the member states engaged in an equally long and complex ratification process. The European Parliament endorsed the treaty on 19 November 1997, and after two referendums and 13 decisions by parliaments, the member states finally concluded the procedure.

==Contents==
The Treaty of Amsterdam comprises 13 protocols, 51 declarations adopted by the Conference, and eight declarations by member states, plus amendments to the existing treaties set out in 15 articles. Article 1 (containing 16 paragraphs) amends the general provisions of the Treaty on European Union and covers the CFSP and cooperation in criminal and police matters. The next four articles (70 paragraphs) amend the EC Treaty, the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty (which expired in 2002), the Euratom Treaty, and the Act concerning the election of the European Parliament. The final provisions contain four articles. The new treaty also set out to simplify the Community Treaties, deleting more than 56 obsolete articles and renumbering the rest in order to make the whole more legible. By way of example, Article 189b on the codecision procedure became Article 251.

The most pressing concerns of ordinary Europeans, such as their legal and personal security, immigration, and fraud prevention, were all dealt with in other chapters of the treaty. In particular, the EU became responsible for legislating on immigration, civil law or civil procedure, insofar as this is necessary for the free movement of persons within the EU. At the same time, intergovernmental co-operation was intensified in the police and criminal justice field so that member states should be able to coordinate their activities more effectively. The Union aims to establish an area of freedom, security and justice for its citizens. The Schengen Agreements have now been incorporated into the legal system of the EU (Ireland remains outside the Schengen agreement due to its open border with the United Kingdom, see Common Travel Area for details).

The treaty lays down new principles and responsibilities in the field of the common foreign and security policy, with the emphasis on projecting the EU&#x27;s values to the outside world, protecting its interests, and reforming its modes of action. The European Council will lay down common strategies, which will then be put into effect by the Council acting by a qualified majority, subject to certain conditions. In other cases, some member states may choose to abstain &quot;constructively&quot;, i.e. without actually preventing actions being taken.

The treaty introduced a High Representative for EU Foreign Policy who, together with the Presidents of the Council and the European Commission, puts a &quot;name and a face&quot; on EU policy to the outside world. Although the Amsterdam Treaty did not provide for a common defence, it did increase the EU&#x27;s responsibilities for peacekeeping and humanitarian work, in particular by forging closer links with Western European Union.

=== Institutions ===
As for the institutions, there were two major reforms concerning the co-decision procedure (the legislative procedure involving the European Parliament and the council), affecting its scope—most legislation was adopted by the co-decision procedure—and its detailed procedures, with the parliament playing a much stronger role. The President of the commission will also have to earn the personal trust of the parliament, which will give them the authority to lay down the commission&#x27;s policy guidelines and play an active part in choosing the Members of the commission by deciding on their appointment by common accord with the national governments. These provisions make the Commission more politically accountable, particularly vis-à-vis the European Parliament. Finally, the new Treaty enables, under very strict conditions, closer co-operation between member states which so wish. Closer co-operation may be established, on a proposal from the commission, in cases where it is not possible to take joint action, provided that such steps do not undermine the coherence of the EU or the rights and equality of its citizens.

==Challenges==
The Amsterdam Treaty did not settle all institutional questions. Work was still in progress on reforming the institutions to make them capable of operating effectively and democratically in a much enlarged EU. The most pressing issues were the composition of the commission and the weighting of member states&#x27; votes upon qualified majority voting. These questions were addressed in the Treaty of Lisbon.

== Signatures ==
===Withdrawal===
On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union and so withdrew from the treaty.

<text>Minera Escondida (which means &#x27;hidden&#x27; in Spanish) is a mining company that operates two open pit copper mines in the Atacama Desert, 170 km southeast of Antofagasta in northern Chile. It is currently the highest producing copper mine in the world. Its 2007 production of 1.483 million tons of the metal was worth US$10.12 billion, mainly as metal in concentrate, but some as cathode, and was 9.5% of world output and 26% of Chilean production, according to the US Geological Survey&#x27;s preliminary estimates of 2007 world mine output.

== Overview ==
It is so called because the main orebody does not outcrop on the surface, but is &#x27;hidden&#x27; by hundreds of metres of practically barren overburden. The lower open pit in the satellite image on the right is the main Escondida mine, but the upper two are Barrick Gold&#x27;s Zaldívar mine. The second Escondida open pit, Escondida Norte, had not been established when the image was taken, but is now immediately to the right (east) of the larger Zaldívar pit.

Escondida produces mainly copper concentrates, which are piped as a slurry down to the port of Coloso, where they are dewatered before shipping, and a smaller proportion of cathode copper from the leaching of both oxide and low grade sulfide ore. It also produces gold and silver.

The mine is owned 57.5% by BHP; 30% by Rio Tinto; and 10% by JECO Corp, a Japanese joint venture established in 1988 by Mitsubishi, with 70% ownership; Nippon Mining &amp; Metals, with 20% ownership; Mitsubishi Materials with a 10% share, adding 2.5% ownership by JECO 2 Ltd., another joint venture incorporated in 2010, &quot;to increase their ownership in Escondida by 2.5%,&quot; with an ownership structure of 50% Mitsubishi Corp, 40% Nippon Mining &amp; Metals, and 10% Mitsubishi Materials. Escondida is managed by a seven-person Owners&#x27; Council designated by the four owners, and is both the largest known copper reserve and the largest foreign investment in Chile.

2006 financial reports showed a cumulative investment of US$5.64 billion, and at year end June 2013, Escondida accounted for approximately 5 percent of all copper production.

== History ==
In 1978, J David Lowell proposed an exploration program along the porphyry copper belt between Chuquicamata in the north and El Salvador in the south. Minera Utah de Chile and Getty Mining (Chile) formed a joint venture to carry it out. On March 14, 1981, &#x27;Pozo 6&#x27; the last scheduled borehole in the program, hit 52 metres of 1.51% copper at a depth of 240 metres and discovered the main Escondida orebody. More holes were drilled to delineate the orebody and a shaft was sunk to provide bulk samples for metallurgical testing. Construction of the mine started in 1988, which including the stripping of over 180 million tonnes of waste to get to the orebody.

The Los Colorados concentrator started up at 35,000 tonnes per day in November 1990, and the first concentrate shipment was made at the end of the year. Expansion has been steady since then. In 1994, an ammonia leach plant to produce copper cathode from a portion of the concentrates was started up in Coloso, but was not economic and closed down four years later. In 1998, the oxide ore leaching plant was started up, which now has a capacity of 150,000 tonnes of copper cathode annually. Also in 1998, the Los Colorados concentrator was expanded to 120,000 tonnes per day. A second concentrator, the 110,000 tonnes per day Laguna Seca mill, started up in 2002, the Escondida Norte pit started production in 2005, and in 2006 a sulphide bioleach plant with an annual capacity 180,000 tonnes of cathode started up, as did a desalination plant in Coloso.

Ownership changed when BHP acquired Utah Mining and then Texaco acquired Getty Oil and sold off its mineral interests. BHP bought these and then sold a 30% interest to Rio Tinto and 10% to JECO. It subsequently sold 2.5% to the International Finance Corporation.

== Escondida Mine ==
==Chilean economy and the world copper market==

Escondida has become an important part of the Chilean economy. According to the CIA World Factbook, the mine&#x27;s 2007 sales of US$10.21 billion were 4.3% of estimated 2007 GDP of US$234.4 billion and about 15% of exports. At the end of 2006, the company employed directly some 2,951 workers and 3,158 contractors

The average copper price in 2007 rose to US$3.23/lb compared with the mine&#x27;s total direct costs of only 60.8 cents/lb, which fell partly as a result of sharply lower treatment and refining costs charged by smelters. The operation was thus highly profitable and paid US$2.2 billion in taxes to the Chilean treasury.

As a result of its considerable size relative to the world copper market, developments at Escondida can have dramatic effects on the world copper price as was shown by its gyrations during the strike in August 2006. The strike was called because the workers felt they were not sharing in the very high profits being made by the company on the back of the record copper price. The workers initially demanded a 13% pay rise plus a bonus of $30,000, but eventually settled for a 5% increase, a $17,000 bonus and a number of other minor benefits. The company managed to keep production at 40% of normal levels, but the union eventually blockaded the road to the mine on 16 August. On 18 August, Escondida declared &quot;force majeure&quot; and stopped production.

Arturo Martinez, the chairman of the &quot;Central Unitaria de Trabajadores&quot;, (CUT, an association of Chilean trade unionists) met with the Escondida workers on 17 August 2006, and said that &quot;what is happening at Escondida puts back onto the agenda a new nationalisation of copper, &quot;lo que ocurre en Escondida pone a la orden del día una nueva nacionalización del cobre&quot;.

<text>In the sport of cricket, a bouncer (or bumper) is a type of short-pitched delivery, usually bowled by a fast bowler, which bounces once and then reaches the batter at head-height.

==Usage==
Bouncers are used to drive the batter back on to his back foot if he has been freely playing front foot scoring shots, such as drives. To this end, bouncers are usually directed more or less at the line of the batter&#x27;s body. Aiming at the batter is legal provided the ball bounces on the pitch; or upon reaching the batter, the ball is below the batter&#x27;s waist. Aiming at the batter&#x27;s head without bouncing on the pitch, known as a beamer, is illegal.
A batter may play a bouncer in either a defensive or an attacking way. If the batter plays it defensively he aims primarily to avoid getting out, and secondarily to avoid being hit by the ball. For a head-high bouncer, these goals are achieved most easily by ducking under the ball. If the ball is at chest height, the batter&#x27;s best defence is to move on to his back foot, raise his bat vertically to chest height, and attempt to block the ball and direct it downwards to the pitch so as to avoid presenting a catch to a fielder. Sometimes the batter will need to jump into the air to gain the necessary height to defend with the bat. He may also sway out of the way. Given these approaches, the bowler can hope to both intimidate the batter somewhat, and possibly have the ball deflect off the bat at an awkward angle and produce a catch for a nearby fielder. 
Conversely, the bouncer can be a very productive ball for the batter, if he plays it in an attacking manner. The shot that is used to attack the bouncer is the hook shot. To play the hook shot the batter moves his back foot backwards and towards the off side as the ball is being delivered. As the ball approaches, the batter swivels from facing the off side to facing the leg side, while holding the bat horizontally. The batter&#x27;s aim is to hit the ball at high speed towards, into or over the leg side boundary. However, despite their run-scoring potential, hook shots frequently lead to wickets falling, particularly through balls hitting the top edge of the bat and being caught by leg side fielders. However, if the bouncer is misdirected by the bowler, and reaches the batter on the off side of his wicket, the cut, uppercut or late cut can be played, either with the intention of guiding the ball along the ground, through a gap in the field setting or over the infield for four or six.

There is an unspoken agreement, particularly in the time before the widespread use of batting helmets, that fast bowlers will not bowl bouncers at each other, because less skilled batters are less likely to effectively defend and therefore more likely to be struck. Breaking of this rule can lead to &quot;bouncer wars&quot; – that is, the targeted bowler engaging in retaliatory hostile short-pitched bowling at his opponent during the following innings.

==ICC rules==

Because of the potential danger to batters of being hit and to stop bowlers bowling bouncers all the time, there are Laws in the Laws of Cricket governing how frequently a bowler may bowl bouncers, as well as how many fielders may field backward of square leg. These laws take into account the relative skill of the batters.

During the 1970s to 1980s, bouncers were used as part of a team&#x27;s intimidatory tactics, especially by the West Indies team. In 1991, the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a &quot;one bouncer per batter per over&quot; rule in an attempt to discourage the use of intimidation. However, the ruling was not well received by players and umpires alike, with English umpire Dickie Bird describing it as &quot;farcical&quot; as he felt that calling intimidatory tactics should be left to the umpire. The ICC changed it to two bouncers per over in 1994, with a two-run no-ball penalty (rather than one-run no-ball) if the bowler exceeded two bouncers an over. One Day International cricket allowed one bouncer per over in 2001 (and a one-run no-ball in case a bowler exceeded the limit).

On 29 October 2012 the ICC increased the number of bouncers that could be bowled during a One Day International to two per over. The number of bouncers per over allowed in T20s was kept to one.

==Controversies==
Fast leg theory, the deliberate and sustained bowling of bouncers aimed at the body, coupled with a cordon of legside catching fieldsmen to catch deflections, was a tactic used by England against Australia in 1932/33, dubbed the Bodyline series by the Australians. It caused a sporting and political firestorm between the mother country and the former colony and several incidents threatened to boil over into public riots. This controversial tactic caused the Laws of Cricket to be reformed to prevent any recurrence. 

In 1954–55 in Sydney, England fast bowler Frank Tyson bowled bouncers at Australian Ray Lindwall, who returned the favour by hospitalising Tyson with one of his own. An angry Tyson returned with a large lump on his head and took 6/85 in the second innings to give England a 38-run victory.

In 1994 at the Oval Devon Malcolm was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Fanie de Villiers. The incensed Malcolm told the South Africans &quot;You guys are history&quot; and took apart their second innings with 9/57.

==Injuries and deaths caused by bouncers==

The bouncer is an aggressive delivery and the very nature of the delivery by a fast bowler and aimed at the head can lead to batters being hit in the chest, neck or head. While rare, impacts to the top part of the body can cause serious injuries or even death. While the laws of cricket can be used to limit the delivery, particularly when being used against specialist bowlers at the end of the batting order, it is not outright banned like the beamer.

In 1962, Indian captain Nari Contractor was hit above his right ear by a Charlie Griffith bouncer which resulted in severe loss of blood and left Contractor critically ill. He regained full consciousness after six days and returned to first-class cricket ten months later. 

In 2006, playing in his 100th test, Australian opener Justin Langer was struck on the head by a bouncer from Makhaya Ntini and hospitalised. In 2008 West Indies batter Shivnarine Chanderpaul was knocked out for several minutes after being hit by a bouncer from Australian fast bowler Brett Lee during a test match. Shoaib Akhtar injured both Gary Kirsten (2003) and Brian Lara (2004) with fast bouncers. Both batters had to be taken off the field. 

In November 2014, Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes was knocked unconscious by a bouncer from Sean Abbott, which hit the side of his head, between the grille and shell of his helmet, during a Sheffield Shield match. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition, suffering from a subarachnoid haemorrhage, but died from his injuries two days later, never having regained consciousness.

During the semi-final of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, against England, Alex Carey injured his chin from a bouncer bowled by Jofra Archer. The resulting blow knocked the helmet off Carey&#x27;s head; he caught it mid-air before it could fall onto the stumps, saving himself from dismissal.

During the second test of the 2019 Ashes Series, Australian batter Steve Smith was hit on the neck by a 148.7 km/h (92.4mph) delivery from England fast bowler Jofra Archer. After retiring concussed, Smith returned to play 45 minutes later. The Australian medical team&#x27;s decision to let him play was criticised by the brain injury charity Headway, as &quot;incredibly dangerous&quot;. Smith&#x27;s replacement, Marnus Labuschagne, became the first concussion substitute in a Test match.

<text>Michael O&#x27;Donoghue (January 5, 1940 – November 8, 1994) was an American writer, actor, editor and comedian.

He was known for his dark and destructive style of comedy and humor, and was a major contributor to &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. He was the first head writer of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and the first performer to deliver a line on the series.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Donoghue was born Michael Henry Donohue in Sauquoit, New York. His father, Michael, worked as an engineer, while his mother, Barbara, stayed home to raise him.

O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s early career included work as a playwright and stage actor at the University of Rochester where he drifted in and out of school beginning in 1959. His first published writing appeared in the school&#x27;s humor magazine &quot;Ugh!&quot;

After a brief time working as a writer in San Francisco, California, O&#x27;Donoghue returned to Rochester and participated in regional theater. During this period, he formed a group called Bread and Circuses specifically to perform his early plays which were of an experimental nature and often quite disturbing to the local audience. Among these are an absurdist work exploring themes of sadism entitled &quot;The Twilight Maelstrom of Cookie Lavagetto&quot;, a cycle of one-act plays called &quot;Le Theatre de Malaise&quot; and the 1964 dark satire &quot;The Death of JFK&quot;.

His first work of greater note was the picaresque feature &quot;The Adventures of Phoebe Zeit-Geist&quot;, published as a serial in &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;. This was an erotic satire of the comic book genre, later released in revised and expanded form as a book by that magazine&#x27;s publisher, Grove Press. Drawn by Frank Springer, the comic detailed the adventures of debutante Phoebe Zeit-Geist as she was variously kidnapped and rescued by a series of bizarre Inuit, Nazis, Chinese foot fetishists, lesbian assassins and other characters. &quot;Doonesbury&quot; comic-strip creator Garry Trudeau cited the strip as an early inspiration, saying, &quot;[A] very heavy influence was a serial in the Sixties called &#x27;Phoebe Zeitgeist&#x27;. . . . It was an absolutely brilliant, deadpan send-up of adventure comics, but with a very edgy modernist kind of approach. To this day, I hold virtually every panel in my brain. It&#x27;s very hard not to steal from it.&quot;

In 1968, O&#x27;Donoghue worked with illustrator and fellow &quot;Evergreen Review&quot; veteran Phil Wende to create the illustrated book &quot;The Incredible, Thrilling Adventures of the Rock&quot;. Biographer Dennis Perrin described it as having &quot;no plot. The same rock sits in the same spot in the same forest for thousands of years. Nothing much happens. Then, while two boys roam the wood in search of a Christmas tree, one sees the rock and is inspired.&quot;

Taking the idea to the publisher Random House, the pair sold the book to the young editor Christopher Cerf. Cerf was a former member of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;, and O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s first acquaintance from that group. Through Cerf, O&#x27;Donoghue would meet George W. S. Trow and other former &quot;Lampoon&quot; writers looking to start a national comedy magazine.

In 1969, O&#x27;Donoghue and Trow co-wrote the script for the James Ivory / Ismail Merchant film &quot;Savages&quot;. This film tells the story of a tribe of prehistoric &quot;Mud People&quot; who happen upon a deserted Gatsby-esque 1930s manor house. The Mud People evolve into contemporary high-society types who enjoy a decadent weekend party at the manor before ultimately devolving back into Mud People. &quot;Savages&quot; was eventually released in 1972.

==&quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine==
O&#x27;Donoghue was, along with Henry Beard and Doug Kenney, a founding writer and later an editor for the satiric &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine. As one of many outstanding &quot;National Lampoon&quot; contributors, O&#x27;Donoghue created some of the distinctive black comedy which characterized the magazine&#x27;s flavor for most of its first decade. His most famous contributions include &quot;The Vietnamese Baby Book&quot;, in which a baby&#x27;s war wounds are cataloged in a keepsake; the &quot;Ezra Taft Benson High School Yearbook&quot;, a precursor to the &quot;Lampoon&quot;″s &quot;High School Yearbook Parody&quot;; the comic &quot;Tarzan of the Cows&quot;; and the continuing feature &quot;Underwear for the Deaf&quot;. Two of his parodies were reprinted in the anthology &quot;National Lampoon: This Side of Parodies&quot; (Warner Paperback Library, 1974).

He was also the editor and main contributor to the &quot;Lampoon&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Humor.&quot; He co-wrote the album &quot;Radio Dinner&quot; with Tony Hendra, and because of the album&#x27;s success, he was assigned to direct and act on &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;. After 13 episodes, publisher Matty Simmons asked O&#x27;Donoghue to return to the magazine. A week later, O&#x27;Donoghue and Simmons argued over what was later revealed to be a simple misunderstanding, and O&#x27;Donoghue left.

It was at the &quot;Lampoon&quot; that O&#x27;Donoghue met Anne Beatts, with whom he became romantically involved. The two later moved on to work at &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; together.

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
On the pioneering late-night sketch comedy program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (originally called &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;), creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels assigned him the position of head writer. O&#x27;Donoghue appeared in the first show&#x27;s opening sketch as an English-language teacher, instructing John Belushi to repeat the phrases, &quot;I would like to feed your fingertips to the wolverines,&quot;, &quot;We are out of badgers. Would you accept a wolverine in its place?&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Hey!&#x27; Ned exclaimed. &#x27;Let&#x27;s boil the wolverines.&#x27;&quot; before suddenly dropping dead of a heart attack. He later made appearances in the persona of a Vegas-style &quot;impressionist&quot; who would pay great praise to showbiz mainstays such as talk show host Mike Douglas and singers Tony Orlando and Dawn—and then speculate how they would react if steel needles with real sharp points were plunged into their eyes. The shrieking fits that followed are believed to be inspired by O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s real-life agonies from chronic migraine headaches.

O&#x27;Donoghue, in reference to his refusal to write for Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;Land of Gorch&quot; sketches which appeared in the early years of SNL, quipped, &quot;I won&#x27;t write for felt.&quot; 

Later, O&#x27;Donoghue cultivated the persona of the grim &quot;Mr. Mike&quot;, a coldly decadent figure who favored viewers with comically dark &quot;Least-Loved Bedtime Stories&quot; such as &quot;The Little Engine that Died&quot;. One of his most notable &quot;SNL&quot; sketches is the &quot;Star Trek&quot; spoof &quot;The Last Voyage of the Starship Enterprise&quot; that was a tour-de-force for Belushi.

In 1979, he produced a television special for NBC, featuring most of the &quot;SNL&quot; cast, called &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video.&quot; Because of its raunchy content, the network rejected the program, which was then released as a theatrical film.

O&#x27;Donoghue returned to &quot;SNL&quot; in 1981 when new executive producer Dick Ebersol needed an old hand to help revive the faltering series. O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s volatile personality and mood swings made this difficult: his first day on the show he screamed at all the cast members, forcing everyone to write on the walls with magic markers. Catherine O&#x27;Hara was rumored to have quit &quot;SNL&quot; after a week and before appearing on-air due to O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s volatility. O&#x27;Hara denied this account, saying she didn&#x27;t feel comfortable in New York City and left to return to &quot;Second City Television&quot;. The only cast member O&#x27;Donoghue liked was Eddie Murphy, reportedly because Murphy was not afraid of him. According to the book &quot;Live from New York&quot;, O&#x27;Donoghue tried to shake things up on that first day by saying &quot;this is what the show lacks&quot; and spray-painting the word &quot;DANGER&quot; on the wall of his office.

O&#x27;Donoghue was released from the show after writing the never-aired sketch &quot;The Last Days in Silverman&#x27;s Bunker&quot;, which compared NBC network president Fred Silverman&#x27;s problems at the network to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s final days. It was planned that John Belushi would return to play Silverman, and a great deal of work had been done on creating sets for the sketch (which would have run for about twenty minutes), including the construction of a large Nazi eagle clutching an NBC corporate logo instead of a swastika. Another unaired O&#x27;Donoghue sketch from around the same period, &quot;The Good Excuse&quot;, also involved Nazi jokes. In the sketch, a captured German officer berated by his captors for Nazi war crimes explains that he had a good excuse, which he whispers into their ears, inaudible to the viewers. His captors are quickly persuaded that the unheard excuse was, in fact, an acceptable reason for the crimes of the Third Reich.

On October 26, 1986, O&#x27;Donoghue was further connected to &quot;SNL&quot; by virtue of his marriage to the show&#x27;s musical director, Cheryl Hardwick, in the late 1980s. The union was fodder for a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; joke in which Dennis Miller noted that the couple was registered at Black+Decker.

O&#x27;Donoghue was one of several original writers rehired by Lorne Michaels upon his return to produce the show in 1985. O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s intention was to write and direct short films for the show; however, none were completed and he wrote little else, apart from a monologue seemingly designed to humiliate Chevy Chase when he hosted the second show of the season. (The monologue began, &quot;Right after I stopped doing cocaine, I turned into a giant garden slug, and, for the life of me, I don&#x27;t know why.&quot;) The monologue never aired, and O&#x27;Donoghue was fired a month later after telling &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;SNL&quot; had become &quot;an embarrassment. It&#x27;s like watching old men die.&quot; His final contribution to the show was a song, &quot;Boulevard of Broken Balls&quot;, co-written with his wife Hardwick and performed by Christopher Walken on the October 24, 1992 episode.

==Other work==
O&#x27;Donoghue acted in a supporting role in the 1985 comedy &quot;Head Office&quot;. He had small parts in the 1979 movie &quot;Manhattan&quot; (which poked fun at &quot;SNL&quot;), the 1987 movie &quot;Wall Street&quot;, and the 1988 movie he co-wrote, &quot;Scrooged&quot;. O&#x27;Donoghue said he loathed the theatrical release of &quot;Scrooged&quot;, insisting until his death that he and co-writer and best friend Mitch Glazer had written a much better film. He also wrote or co-wrote a number of unproduced screenplays, of which the Chevy Chase collaboration &quot;Saturday Matinee&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Planet of the Cheap Special Effects&quot;) remains legendary in Hollywood screenwriter circles.

O&#x27;Donoghue also found some success as a country music songwriter, his most notable credit being Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Single Women&quot; (1982). The song, originally composed for a 1981 &quot;SNL&quot; skit, later inspired the 1984 ABC TV movie &quot;Single Bars, Single Women&quot; starring Tony Danza and Jean Smart, which was produced by O&#x27;Donoghue.

In 1992, O&#x27;Donoghue created a sketch show pilot called &quot;TV&quot; for the Fox network. It featured Kelly Lynch and it was directed by Walter Williams, the creator of &quot;Mr. Bill&quot;, but like a lot of O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s work, it was too unconventional for primetime TV.

==Death==
On November 8, 1994, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 54.

==Biography==
Dennis Perrin&#x27;s biography &quot;Mr. Mike: The Life and Work of Michael O&#x27;Donoghue&quot; was published in 1998 by Avon Books. The Barnes and Noble overview read, &quot;This is the unvarnished story of a towering figure in American popular culture, the prime artistic force behind an entire generation of humorists and satirists.&quot;

<text>A rice paddle (, Japanese: , ) is a large flat spoon used in East Asian cuisine. It is used to stir and to serve rice, to dip gochujang, and to mix vinegar into the rice for sushi.

Rice paddles are traditionally made from bamboo, wood, or lacquer, and nowadays often from plastic.

==History==

The specific origin of the rice paddle is unknown, but it has been spotted in artifacts dating back to the 4th or 5th century. One such artifact originating from the Silla dynasty in Korea was excavated from the Gold Crown Tomb in Gyeongju along with a pot.

The Japanese version of the rice paddle, the &#x27;shamoji&#x27;, is said to have been first devised by a monk on Itsukushima, Hiroshima Prefecture. The word is an example of nyōbō kotoba, being derived from the first part of , plus the suffix.

Modern rice cookers may include a rice paddle in the box, usually made of white plastic.

==Materials and uses==

In Korea, rice paddles, or &#x27;jugeok&#x27; () were originally made out of wood in the 4th century, but began to be made out of brass during the Goryeo dynasty. Throughout the Joseon dynasty, they also began to be made from bamboo.

Modern rice paddles are typically made from plastic. When in use, they are dipped in water frequently during use to prevent rice from sticking to it. Some expensive plastic rice paddles have non-stick surfaces.

Rice paddles are also used to crush vegetables, such as garlic and cucumbers, as cleavers are used in Western cuisine.

==Culture==

When scooping rice with a rice paddle in Korea, the rice is traditionally scooped towards the center of the bowl, as to prevent fortune from escaping the household.

In Japan, the rice paddle (&quot;shamoji&quot;) has also been a symbol of unity between the mother and wife in Japanese society. In one tradition, it was passed down from one generation to the next to symbolize the family duties that were handed down.
In Japan, the is also a good luck charm dedicated to Shinto shrines and decorated with the word written on the part that scoops up rice when praying for victory. This is because the Japanese word , which means to scoop up rice, is pronounced the same as , which means to capture the enemy. The custom became even more famous during the Russo-Japanese War, when soldiers dedicated many to Itsukushima Shrine to pray for Japan&#x27;s victory in the war. In March 2023, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Ukraine and presented President Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a with the word written on it to pray for Ukraine&#x27;s victory over Russia in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

<doc id="525221" wikidata="Q3512148" url="?curid=525221" title="Big-game fishing">
<text>Big-game fishing, also known as offshore sportfishing, offshore gamefishing or blue-water fishing, is a form of recreational fishing targeting large game fish, usually on a large body of water such as a sea or ocean.

==History==
Big-game fishing started as a sport after the invention of the motorboat. Charles Frederick Holder, a marine biologist, and early conservationist, is credited with founding the sport in 1898. He went on to found and lead the Tuna Club of Avalon and went on to publish many articles and books on the subject, noted for their combination of accurate scientific detail with exciting narratives. Purpose-built game fishing boats appeared early in the 20th century. An example is the &quot;Crete&quot;, in use at Catalina Island, California, in 1915, and shipped to Hawaii the following year. According to a newspaper report at that time, the &quot;Crete&quot; had &quot;... a deep cockpit, a chair fitted for landing big fish and leather pockets for placing the pole.&quot;

==Big-game species==
The billfish (swordfish, marlin and sailfish), larger tunas (bluefin, yellowfin and bigeye) and sharks (mako, bull, great white, tiger, hammerhead and other large species) are the main species recognized as big-game fish. Many anglers also consider groupers and Atlantic tarpon as big-game species.

Smaller game fish, such as dolphinfish, wahoo, smaller tuna species such as albacore and skipjack tuna and barracuda are commonly caught as bycatch or taken deliberately for use as live or dead bait and/or chum.

==Locations==
Historically most of the locations where the sport was developed, such as Avalon, California; Florida; Bimini in the Bahamas; Cairns, Queensland, Australia; northern New Zealand; Panama; Wedgeport in Nova Scotia and Kona in Hawaii, benefited from the presence of large numbers of gamefish relatively close to shore, within range of the boats of that era.

As the vessels used for sportfishing became larger, faster, longer-ranged and more seaworthy, big-game species are now pursued on grounds ranging from 60 or 70 miles&#x27; distance from port, such as the submarine canyons of the United States continental shelf, to hundreds of miles as in the case of the San Diego long range fishery, where large live-aboard vessels range far out into the Pacific searching for tuna schools.

Today big-game fishing is carried out from ports in tropical and temperate coasts practically worldwide.

===Anglo-America===
The United States has the world&#x27;s largest saltwater fishing industry and along the entire length of the East Coast, from Key West to the Gulf of Maine, big-game anglers pursue a variety of tropical and temperate sportfish ranging from sailfish and dolphinfish in the Florida Keys to giant bluefin tuna in Massachusetts and in Canadian waters. The West Coast lacks the influence of the warm Gulf Stream current, and most big game species are mainly confined to California, a birthplace of the sport. Some of the same species that were fished for by the pioneers of the sport — Pacific bluefin tuna, broadbill swordfish and striped marlin — are still fished for today.

===Latin and South America===

Billfish and tuna are pursued in almost all the Latin American coastal nations, many of which are renowned for the excellence of their fisheries. Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador and Guatemala have the largest fleets of sport fishing boats. Costa Rica&#x27;s pacific coast, especially the coast of the Guanacaste Province, is famous for its fishing because of the ocean currents and the government catch and release laws.

Rio San Juan in Nicaragua is famous for sport fishing for giant tarpon (fresh water tarpon fishing). The government presently enforces catch and release. An annual International tarpon fishing tournament has been held for many years. The 55th annual tournament was held September 13 &amp; 14 2015.

===Europe===
In the United Kingdom, big-game tunny fishing off Scarborough was in fashion in the 1930s for a few years. &quot;Tunny&quot; was the name used in Britain at that time for Atlantic bluefin tuna. Colonel Edward Peel landed a world-record tunny of , capturing the record by from one caught off Nova Scotia by the American champion Zane Grey.

==Boats==

Big-game fishing requires a boat of sufficient seaworthiness and range to transport the crew to the fishing grounds and back. Boats that fit these requirements may be as small as the 18 to 21-foot trailerable boats commonly used along the Australian coast, in New Zealand and on the lee coasts of the Hawaiian Islands where they are known as the &quot;mosquito fleet&quot;. At the other extreme the 100-foot and larger vessels of the San Diego long range fleet and similar, although less refined &quot;party boats&quot; operating from New England, transport 25, 30 or more anglers in search of yellowfin, bluefin and bigeye tuna.

The cost of a suitable boat, electronics, tackle and the operating costs (fuels and other consumables, insurance, mooring fees and maintenance) can be very substantial. Consequently, many big-game anglers prefer to use charter services where they hire the use of a boat and equipment, and the fish-finding expertise of a captain, in preference to maintaining their own. Either way, big-game fishing can be an extremely expensive pursuit, and one in which the wealthy have tended to feature prominently.

The classic sport fisherman
Most of the features of the classic sport fisherman were gradually developed in the 1920s and 1930s as existing motor cruisers and commercial fishing vessels were adapted for fishing with outriggers, fighting chairs and other ancillaries such as bait boxes and flybridge helm stations. These boats, though crude by modern standards, scored many pioneering big game catches of huge bluefin tuna, broadbill swordfish and marlin. Through the 1930s and 1940s sportfishermen in Florida, amongst them John Rybovich and Ernest Hemingway, continued to innovate and refine, and in 1946 the Rybovich yard launched the Miss Chevy II, a 34-footer that crystallized all the innovations that had gone before into a design whose features - raised foredeck, flybridge controls and roomy cockpit - are still closely followed by today&#x27;s leading sportfish builders. The need for greater range and speed as anglers sought gamefish further and further offshore resulted in the development of bigger boats powered by larger engines, but the basic layout of a dedicated big game fishing vessel has remained largely the same since the late 1940s.

Smaller sportfishing boats
The development of outboard power opened up many big game fishing grounds to smaller craft in the 18 to 25 foot range. Various boats designs may fit this category but in recent times the center console has become popular due to the ability to fish from all edges of the boat, providing the angler flexibility when fighting or landing fish.

Electronics
Electronics technology developed for commercial fishermen has become increasingly used by recreational anglers. Fishfinders, also known as bottom machines or echo sounders, are now commonplace. Other electronics used to narrow down the search for fish may include radar, forward or side-scanning sonar, water temperature sensors and sea surface temperature imagery obtained from satellites.
==Land-based big-game game fishing==
In some areas big-game species can be caught by land-based anglers practicing land-based game fishing, with the rock platforms of Jervis Bay in New South Wales, Australia being probably the most well-known. Black marlin of up to 200 lbs have been caught here by anglers floating out baits on balloons.

==Techniques==
===Trolling===
Fish are enticed by trolling fishing lures (designed to resemble squid or other baitfish) or baits behind the boat. Multiple lines are often used. Outriggers were designed to spread the lines more widely. The outrigger holds the lines further away from the boat&#x27;s wake, setting lures into more clear water thus making it easier for fish to target in on available lures.

===Chumming===
Chumming or chunking is the practice of throwing groundbait made of pieces of bait fish overboard to attract larger game fish. This is called &quot;berley&quot; in Australia.

===Fighting the fish===
Once a fish is properly hooked on a line, a somewhat tricky task as often initial nibbles only partly hook the fish, one of the fishermen attempts to reel it in. The captain assists by maneuvering the boat so that the fish remains astern (behind the boat), while other members of the crew race to reel in the other lines so as to avoid tangling with the angler reeling in the fish.

Most of the time, the fishing line used for sport fishing has a breaking strain less than the maximum force the fish can apply to the line. The fishing reels therefore have sophisticated, adjustable drag mechanisms which allow the line to escape if the fish pulls on it, but keep the specified tension on the line. When hooked, most fish will circulate in different directions, and when they are not pulling away from the boat the fisherman can take the opportunity to reel in some of the line. Eventually, if the fish tires and has not broken the line, they will be reeled in; however, the challenge does not end there. Hauling a heavy, powerful, and still very much alive fish on board the boat represents a considerable challenge, unless the fish is tagged and released. Strategies include: gaffing, pulling it in with one&#x27;s hands, or a net for smaller fish.

The fish can be fought with or without a game-chair. With a game-chair, the angler sits in a specially designed chair at the stern of the boat, and places the butt of the rod into a gimbaled mount. Most rods used in this manner are quite long. The older and more classic models had straight rod butts. More contemporary models have bent rod butts, which give a more convenient angle for fighting the fish when the rod is placed in the mount. With large fish, this can still represent a considerable challenge, but &quot;stand-up&quot; game fishing, without the assistance of a chair and with the seat mount replaced by a harness, requires a good deal of strength and endurance, as well as body mass.

===Kite fishing===
Big Game fishing has evolved from a heavy tackle to a light tackle sport in many regions. Using a fishing kite has opened the door to fishing for Billfish, especially Sailfish with tackle as light as 8 or 12 lb but normally 20 - 30 lb gear is used. The kite is also effective on Tuna, Dolphin fish (Mahi Mahi), Sharks, Marlin, Swordfish &amp; all sorts of other Big Game fish. The idea behind the kite is that a smaller live bait can be fished on lighter tackle and positioned away from the boat and placed right on the surface. The Bait fish will try to run away or fight to get deeper in the water column, but the kite will hold the bait in place. The fighting action and stress of the bait will &quot;turn on&quot; big game fish and cause them to strike. This method of fishing not only presents a bait to the Big Game Fish but drives the fish to strike the bait.

===Bait fishing===
Bait fishing is fishing while using bait. Bait is usually alive for catching better fish.

===Artificial lure fishing===
Lure fishing typically employs the use of an artificial lure used as a bait to attract game fish. Artificial fishing lures can either be a hard bait or soft bait construction.

<doc id="525222" wikidata="Q2892167" url="?curid=525222" title="Henry Hunt (politician)">
<text>Henry &quot;Orator&quot; Hunt (6 November 1773 – 13 February 1835) was a British radical speaker and agitator remembered as a pioneer of working-class radicalism and an important influence on the later Chartist movement. He advocated parliamentary reform and the repeal of the Corn Laws. He was the first member of parliament to advocate for women&#x27;s suffrage; in 1832 he presented a petition to parliament from a woman asking for the right to vote.

==Background==
Hunt was born on 6 November 1773 in Upavon, Wiltshire.

==Career==

Hunt became a prosperous farmer. He was first drawn into radical politics during the Napoleonic Wars, becoming a supporter of Francis Burdett. His talent for public speaking became noted in the electoral politics of Bristol, where he denounced the complacency of both the Whigs and the Tories, and proclaimed himself a supporter of democratic radicalism. It was thanks to his particular talents that a new programme beyond the narrow politics of the day made steady progress in the difficult years that followed the conclusion of the war with France.

===Orator===

After his rousing speeches at mass meetings held in Spa Fields in London in 1816, Hunt became known as the &quot;Orator&quot;, a nickname attributed to Robert Southey. He embraced a programme that included annual parliaments and universal suffrage, promoted openly and with none of the conspiratorial element of the old Jacobin clubs. The tactic he most favoured was that of &#x27;mass pressure&#x27;, which he felt, if given enough weight, could achieve reform without insurrection.

His efforts at mass politics had the effect of radicalising large sections of the community unrepresented in Parliament, although the direct success of these efforts was limited.

===Peterloo===

Hunt was invited by the Patriotic Union Society, formed by the &quot;Manchester Observer&quot;, to be one of the scheduled speakers at a rally in Manchester on 16 August 1819, which turned into the Peterloo massacre. Arrested for high treason and convicted of the lesser charge of seditious conspiracy, he was sentenced to a term of 30 months at Ilchester Gaol. For the establishment, Hunt believed in some concepts that could threaten the profits of the business establishment: equal rights, universal suffrage, parliamentary reform, and an end to child labour.

The debacle at Peterloo, caused by an over-reaction of the local Manchester authorities, added greatly to his prestige. Moral force was not sufficient in itself, and physical force entailed too great a risk. Although urged to do so after Peterloo, Hunt refused to give his approval to schemes for a full-scale insurrection. Thereby momentum was lost, as more desperate souls turned to worn out cloak-and-dagger schemes, which surfaced in the Cato Street conspiracy.

While in prison for his role at Peterloo, Hunt turned to writing to disseminate his message, through a variety of forms including an autobiography. After his release he attempted to recover some of his lost fortune through new business ventures in London, which included the production and marketing of a roasted corn &quot;Breakfast Powder&quot;, the &quot;most salubrious and nourishing Beverage that can be substituted for the use of Tea and Coffee, which are always exciting, and frequently the most irritating to the Stomach and Bowels.&quot; He also made shoe-blacking bottles, which carried the slogan &quot;Equal Laws, Equal Rights, Annual Parliaments, Universal Suffrage, and the Ballot.&quot; Synthetic coal, intended specifically for the French market, was another of his schemes. After the July Revolution in 1830 he sent samples to Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette and other political heroes, along with fraternal greetings.

===Parliament===

Business interests notwithstanding, he still found time for practical politics, fighting battles over a whole range of issues, and always pushing for reform and accountability. In 1828 he ran unsuccessfully as a Councilman for the City of London in Farringdon Without on a campaign of investigating how the City&#x27;s funds were used.

In 1830 he became a member of Parliament for Preston defeating the future British Prime Minister Edward Stanley, but was defeated when standing for re-election in 1833. As a consistent champion of the working classes, a term he used with increasing frequency, he opposed the Whigs, both old and new, and the Reform Act 1832, which he believed did not go far enough in the extension of the franchise. He gave speeches addressed to the &quot;Working Classes and no other&quot;, urging them to press for full equal rights. In 1832 he presented the first petition in support of women&#x27;s suffrage to Parliament. It was received however with much ribald laughter and antagonism. Also in that year, he petitioned parliament on behalf of the radical preacher John Ward, who had been imprisoned for blasphemy.

In his opposition to the Reform Bill, Hunt revived the Great Northern Union, a pressure group he set up some years before, intended to unite the northern industrial workers behind a platform of full democratic reform; and it is in this specifically that his influence on Chartism can be detected.

==Death==

Hunt&#x27;s health declined during 1834, and in early 1835 he suffered a severe stroke at Alresford, Hampshire, where he died on 13 February 1835. He was buried at Parham Park, Sussex.

==Legacy==

A monument to Hunt was erected in 1842 by &quot;the working people&quot;, in Every Street, Manchester, in Scholefield&#x27;s Chapel Yard. A &quot;spiral&quot; march was held on the anniversary of Peterloo, from Piccadilly around the town past the Peterloo site, down to Deansgate and through Ancoats to the monument. The monument&#x27;s stonework deteriorated, and it was demolished in 1888.

==In popular culture==

In Mike Leigh&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Peterloo&quot;, Hunt is portrayed by Rory Kinnear.

<text>In mathematics, a singular perturbation problem is a problem containing a small parameter that cannot be approximated by setting the parameter value to zero. More precisely, the solution cannot be uniformly approximated by an asymptotic expansion

:formula_1

as formula_2. Here formula_3 is the small parameter of the problem and formula_4 are a sequence of functions of formula_3 of increasing order, such as formula_6. This is in contrast to regular perturbation problems, for which a uniform approximation of this form can be obtained. Singularly perturbed problems are generally characterized by dynamics operating on multiple scales. Several classes of singular perturbations are outlined below.

The term &quot;singular perturbation&quot; was
coined in the 1940s by Kurt Otto Friedrichs and Wolfgang R. Wasow.
== Methods of analysis ==
A perturbed problem whose solution can be approximated on the whole problem domain, whether space or time, by a single asymptotic expansion has a regular perturbation. Most often in applications, an acceptable approximation to a regularly perturbed problem is found by simply replacing the small parameter formula_3 by zero everywhere in the problem statement. This corresponds to taking only the first term of the expansion, yielding an approximation that converges, perhaps slowly, to the true solution as formula_3 decreases. The solution to a singularly perturbed problem cannot be approximated in this way: As seen in the examples below, a singular perturbation generally occurs when a problem&#x27;s small parameter multiplies its highest operator. Thus naively taking the parameter to be zero changes the very nature of the problem. In the case of differential equations, boundary conditions cannot be satisfied; in algebraic equations, the possible number of solutions is decreased.

Singular perturbation theory is a rich and ongoing area of exploration for mathematicians, physicists, and other researchers. The methods used to tackle problems in this field are many. The more basic of these include the method of matched asymptotic expansions and WKB approximation for spatial problems, and in time, the Poincaré–Lindstedt method, the method of multiple scales and periodic averaging.
The numerical methods for solving singular perturbation problems are also very popular.

For books on singular perturbation in ODE and PDE&#x27;s, see for example Holmes, &quot;Introduction to Perturbation Methods&quot;, Hinch, &quot;Perturbation methods&quot; or Bender and Orszag, &quot;Advanced Mathematical Methods for Scientists and Engineers&quot;.

== Examples of singular perturbative problems ==

Each of the examples described below shows how a naive perturbation analysis, which assumes that the problem is regular instead of singular, will fail. Some show how the problem may be solved by more sophisticated singular methods.

=== Vanishing coefficients in ordinary differential equations ===
Differential equations that contain a small parameter that premultiplies the highest order term typically exhibit boundary layers, so that the solution evolves in two different scales. For example, consider the boundary value problem

:formula_9

Its solution when formula_10 is the solid curve shown below. Note that the solution changes rapidly near the origin. If we naively set formula_11, we would get the solution labelled &quot;outer&quot; below which does not model the boundary layer, for which &quot;x&quot; is close to zero. For more details that show how to obtain the uniformly valid approximation, see method of matched asymptotic expansions.
=== Examples in time ===
An electrically driven robot manipulator can have slower mechanical dynamics and faster electrical dynamics, thus exhibiting two time scales. In such cases, we can divide the system into two subsystems, one corresponding to faster dynamics and other corresponding to slower dynamics, and then design controllers for each one of them separately. Through a singular perturbation technique, we can make these two subsystems independent of each other, thereby simplifying the control problem.

Consider a class of system described by the following set of equations:

:formula_12
:formula_13
:formula_14

with formula_15. The second equation indicates that the dynamics of formula_16 is much faster than that of formula_17. A theorem due to Tikhonov states that, with the correct conditions on the system, it will initially and very quickly approximate the solution to the equations

:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20

on some interval of time and that, as formula_3 decreases toward zero, the system will approach the solution more closely in that same interval.

=== Examples in space ===

In fluid mechanics, the properties of a slightly viscous fluid are dramatically different outside and inside a narrow boundary layer. Thus the fluid exhibits multiple spatial scales.

Reaction–diffusion systems in which one reagent diffuses much more slowly than another can form spatial patterns marked by areas where a reagent exists, and areas where it does not, with sharp transitions between them. In ecology, predator-prey models such as

:formula_22
:formula_23

where formula_24 is the prey and formula_25 is the predator, have been shown to exhibit such patterns.

=== Algebraic equations ===

Consider the problem of finding all roots of the polynomial formula_26. In the limit formula_27, this cubic degenerates into the quadratic formula_28 with roots at formula_29. Substituting a regular perturbation series

:formula_30

in the equation and equating equal powers of formula_3 only yields corrections to these two roots:

:formula_32

To find the other root, singular perturbation analysis must be used. We must then deal with the fact that the equation degenerates into a quadratic when we let formula_3 tend to zero, in that limit one of the roots escapes to infinity. To prevent this root from becoming invisible to the perturbative analysis, we must rescale formula_34 to keep track with this escaping root so that in terms of the rescaled variables, it doesn&#x27;t escape. We define a rescaled variable formula_35 where the exponent formula_36 will be chosen such that we rescale just fast enough so that the root is at a finite value of formula_37 in the limit of formula_3 to zero, but such that it doesn&#x27;t collapse to zero where the other two roots will end up. In terms of formula_37 we have

:formula_40

We can see that for formula_41 the formula_42 is dominated by the lower degree terms, while at formula_43 it becomes as dominant as the formula_44 term while they both dominate the remaining term. This point where the highest order term will no longer vanish in the limit formula_3 to zero by becoming equally dominant to another term, is called significant degeneration; this yields the correct rescaling to make the remaining root visible. This choice yields

:formula_46

Substituting the perturbation series

:formula_47

yields

:formula_48

We are then interested in the root at formula_49; the double root at formula_50 are the two roots that we&#x27;ve found above that collapse to zero in the limit of an infinite rescaling. Calculating the first few terms of the series then yields

:formula_51

<text>James Edwin Webb (October 7, 1906 – March 27, 1992) was an American government official who served as Undersecretary of State from 1949 to 1952. He was the second Administrator of NASA from February 14, 1961, to October 7, 1968. Webb led NASA from the beginning of the Kennedy administration through the end of the Johnson administration, thus overseeing each of the critical first crewed missions throughout the Mercury and Gemini programs until days before the launch of the first Apollo mission. He also dealt with the Apollo 1 fire.

In 2002, the Next Generation Space Telescope was renamed the James Webb Space Telescope as a tribute to Webb.

==Early and personal life==
Webb was born in 1906 in Tally Ho in Granville County, North Carolina. His father, John Frederick Webb, was superintendent of Granville County&#x27;s segregated public schools. Sarah Gorham Webb was his mother. He completed his college education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Education in 1928. He was a member of the Acacia fraternity. Webb became a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, and he served as a Marine Corps pilot on active duty from 1930 to 1932. Webb then studied law at The George Washington University Law School, where he received a J.D. degree in 1936. In the same year, he was admitted to the Bar of the District of Columbia.

Webb married Patsy Aiken Douglas in 1938, and they had two children. He was a Freemason.

==Career==
===U.S. House of Representatives staff===
Webb began his long career in public service in Washington, D.C., by serving as secretary to U.S. Representative Edward W. Pou of North Carolina from 1932 to 1934. Pou was chairman of the Rules Committee and Dean of the House. With Webb&#x27;s assistance, Pou was influential in pushing through the first legislation of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal during the first hundred days of Roosevelt&#x27;s term. In addition to his secretarial duties, Webb provided physical assistance to the aging and ailing Pou.

===Assistant to private attorney===
Webb next served as an assistant in the office of Oliver Max Gardner, an attorney, former governor of North Carolina and friend of President Roosevelt, from 1934 to 1936. Gardner supported Webb in finishing law school.

During the Air Mail scandal of 1934, the government halted the carrying of airmail by private airline companies. A group of airline executives, led by Thomas Morgan, the President of the Sperry Gyroscope Company in Brooklyn, hired Gardner&#x27;s firm to represent them. The successful resolution resulted in the resumption of contracts with private airlines.

===Personnel director for Sperry Gyroscope===
As a result of their interactions, Sperry Gyroscope hired Webb as the personnel director and assistant to Thomas Morgan, the president of Sperry. Between 1936 and 1944, Webb became the secretary-treasurer and later the vice president of Sperry. During his tenure, Sperry expanded from 800 employees to more than 33,000 and became a major supplier of navigation equipment and airborne radar systems during World War II.

===Marine re-enlistment===
Although he wished to re-enlist in the Marines at the start of the war, Webb was deferred because of the importance of his work at Sperry to the war effort. He reentered the Marine Corps on February 1, 1944 and soon became the commanding officer of Marine Air Warning Group One, 9th Marine Aircraft Wing, first as a captain and later as a major. Webb&#x27;s brother, Henry Gorham Webb, was also a Marine Corps officer who was at that time a prisoner of war in Japan, having served with VMF-211 during the Battle of Wake Island, and then subsequently captured.

He was put in charge of a radar program for the invasion of the Japanese mainland. He had orders to leave for Japan on August 14, 1945, but his orders were delayed, and the Surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945, meant that he did not see combat.

===Bureau of the Budget===
After World War II, Webb returned to Washington, DC and served as executive assistant to Gardner, now the Undersecretary of the Treasury, for a short while before he was named as the director of the Bureau of the Budget in the Office of the President of the United States, a position that he held until 1949. Webb was recommended for the appointment to Harry S. Truman by Gardner and Treasury Secretary John Snyder. Because of Webb&#x27;s association with the Treasury Department, his appointment was seen as subordinating the BoB to the Treasury. His appointment surprised Webb, who had not been told of the final decision to appoint him.

The Bureau of the Budget prepared the President&#x27;s proposed budget each year for presentation to Congress. Truman&#x27;s objective for the budget was to bring it to balance after the large expenditures of World War II.

===State Department===
President Truman next nominated Webb to serve as an undersecretary of state in the U.S. Department of State, which he began in January 1949. Webb&#x27;s first assignment from Secretary Dean Acheson was to reorganize the department, adding 12 new presidential appointees and reducing the power of subordinate officers. Webb also consolidated the flow of foreign policy information and intelligence through the secretariat. When President Truman signed the bill codifying the reorganization on May 26, 1949, the department, which had been losing power and influence to the military, strengthened its ties to the President.

A question facing the Department of State at the time was whether the Soviet Union could be contained through only diplomatic means or whether the military would be needed. Paul Nitze, as Director of Policy Planning, wrote a classified memo, NSC 68, arguing for a military build-up of NATO forces. Although Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson opposed an increase in the Defense budget, Webb got Truman to convince him to support the recommendations of NSC68.

On June 25, 1950, the North Korean Army invaded South Korea. Webb and Secretary Acheson devised three recommendations: involve the United Nations, send the Navy Pacific Fleet into the Yellow Sea, and authorize an Air Force strike on the Korean tanks. Truman implemented the first two recommendations immediately but delayed the use of force by several days. The Defense Department was blamed for the lack of U.S. preparedness, and Johnson tried to blame Acheson. Webb worked with his contacts in Congress and others to convince Truman to replace Johnson, and George Marshall was called out of retirement to become the new Secretary of Defense.

In 1950, Webb established an alliance with university scientists, Project Troy, to bolster the United States&#x27; psychological warfare capabilities, in particular studying how to circumvent Soviet attempts to jam Voice of America broadcasts.

With the attention of the department focused on the Korean War, Webb&#x27;s influence weakened. As the author of NSC68, State Department Director of Policy Planning Paul Nitze became the principal advisor to Secretary Acheson, and a misunderstanding between Webb and Nitze led to Nitze outwardly calling for Webb&#x27;s resignation, but the rift eventually blew over. Webb started suffering from migraines and resigned in 1952.

Webb left Washington for a position in the Kerr-McGee Oil Corp. in Oklahoma City, but he was still active in government circles, for instance in serving on the Draper Committee in 1958.

===NASA===

On February 14, 1961, Webb accepted President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s appointment as administrator of NASA, taking the reins from interim director, Deputy Administrator Hugh L. Dryden. Webb directed NASA&#x27;s undertaking of the goal set by Kennedy of landing an American on the Moon before the end of the 1960s through the Apollo program.
For seven years after Kennedy&#x27;s announcement on May 25, 1961, of the goal of a crewed lunar landing, Webb lobbied for support for NASA in Congress, until he left NASA in October 1968. As a longtime Washington insider and with the backing of President Lyndon B. Johnson, he was able to produce continued support and resources for Apollo.

During Webb&#x27;s administration, NASA developed from a loose collection of research centers to a coordinated organization. He had a key role in creating the Manned Spacecraft Center, later the Johnson Space Center, in Houston. Despite the pressures to focus on the Apollo program, Webb ensured that NASA carried out a program of planetary exploration with the Mariner and Pioneer space programs. Webb was an early champion of space telescopes, like the one that would later bear his name.

Encouraged by Kennedy and Johnson, Webb made racial integration a priority for the agency. NASA publicly supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and initiated a series of innovative programs aimed at increasing black participation including specifically targeting black colleges and schools with recruitment programs. On one occasion Webb and Wernher von Braun famously confronted and lectured segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace on racial integration in front of the press. NASA had the worst black representation of any government agency in 1961, but by the time Webb stepped down, it was the best and considered the model for other government agencies on racial integration.

After the Apollo 1 accident in 1967, Webb told the media, &quot;We&#x27;ve always known that something like this was going to happen sooner or later... Who would have thought that the first tragedy would be on the ground?&quot; Webb went to Johnson and asked for NASA to be allowed to handle the accident investigation and to direct its recovery, according to a procedure that was established following the in-flight accident on Gemini 8 (1966). He promised to be truthful in assessing blame regarding Apollo 1, even to himself and NASA management, as appropriate. The agency set out to discover the details of the tragedy, to correct problems, and to continue progress toward the Apollo 11 lunar landing.
Webb reported the investigation board&#x27;s findings to various congressional committees and took personal blame at nearly every meeting. Whether by happenstance or by design, Webb managed to deflect some of the backlash over the accident away from both NASA as an agency and from the Johnson administration. As a result, NASA&#x27;s image and popular support were largely undamaged.

Webb was informed by CIA sources in 1968 that the Soviet Union was developing its own heavy N1 rocket for a crewed lunar mission, and he directed NASA to prepare Apollo 8 for a possible lunar orbital mission that year. At the time, Webb&#x27;s assertions about the Soviet Union&#x27;s abilities were doubted by some people, and the N-1 was dubbed &quot;Webb&#x27;s Giant&quot;.
However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, revelations about the Soviet Moonshot have given support to Webb&#x27;s conclusion.

Webb was a Democrat tied closely to Johnson, and since Johnson chose not to run for reelection, Webb decided to step down as administrator to allow the next president, Republican Richard Nixon, to choose his own administrator. Webb left NASA on October 7, 1968, his sixty-second birthday, just before the first crewed flight in the Apollo program.

Drawing on his NASA experience, Webb published &quot;Space Age Management: The Large-Scale Approach&quot; (1969), in which he presented the space program as a model of successful administration that could be broadened to address major societal problems.

In 1969, Johnson presented Webb with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Webb is also a 1976 recipient of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution.

==Later life and death==
After retiring from NASA, Webb remained in Washington, DC, serving on several advisory boards, including serving as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution. In 1981, he was awarded the Sylvanus Thayer Award by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point for his dedication to his country.

Webb died from a heart attack at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington on March 27, 1992, at age 85. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Webb was played by Dan Lauria in the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, and by Ken Strunk in the 2016 film &quot;Hidden Figures&quot;.

NASA&#x27;s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), originally known as the Next Generation Space Telescope, was renamed after Webb in 2002. Launched on December 25, 2021, it is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope.

===Controversy about telescope name===
In March 2021, a commentary in &quot;Scientific American&quot; urged NASA to rename the James Webb Space Telescope, accusing Webb of complicity in the State Department&#x27;s purge of homosexuals from the federal workforce in the 1940s and 1950s, known as the &quot;lavender scare&quot;. This controversy was reported in the press. The scientists who proposed renaming the telescope pointed to the case of NASA budget analyst Clifford Norton, who was fired after an arrest for making a &quot;homosexual advance.&quot; While Webb was head of the agency at the time of Norton&#x27;s firing, he was not involved with the decision.

Personnel matters fell under the purview of the Deputy Administrator of NASA Robert Seamans; there is no direct evidence of that Webb had any knowledge of Norton&#x27;s firing. Such firings have been claimed to be a &quot;custom within the agency&quot; in that era. Historian David K. Johnson, author of 2004 book &quot;The Lavender Scare&quot;, has stated that there is no evidence Webb led or instigated any persecution, nor played &quot;any sort of leadership role in the lavender scare&quot;. According to astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi, the initial accusations that Webb was part of the lavender scare were based on a quote from John Peurifoy (who, like Webb, had the rank of &quot;Undersecretary of State&quot;) which was wrongly attributed to Webb.

On September 30, 2021, NASA announced that it would keep the JWST name after running an investigation and finding &quot;no evidence at this time that warrants changing the name&quot;.

Former administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe, who made the decision to name the telescope after administrator Webb, stated that to suggest that Webb should &quot;be held accountable for that activity when there&#x27;s no evidence to even hint [that he participated in it] is an injustice&quot;.

On October 24, 2022, the Royal Astronomical Society released a statement on the matter, in which they indicated the editorial policy of their journals would be to not spell out Webb&#x27;s name when referring to the telescope until such time as an investigation was completed and a report made public. Less than a month later, NASA released the report of their investigation and accompanying evidence. The report, based on an examination of more than 50,000 documents, found there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Webb either in his time in the State Department or at NASA. In regard to his time at State, the report mirrors Johnson&#x27;s earlier findings – Webb played no role in helping the Hoey committee or their agents. With regard to Norton&#x27;s firing at NASA, the report indicates Webb probably was not told of the incident; it also notes that the policy under which Norton was fired was not a NASA policy but an Executive Order applying to all government agencies, that was not enforced by NASA, but rather the Civil Service Commission, over which Webb had no influence. This led to the Royal Astronomical Society reversing its position.

<text>Gehyra mutilata, also known commonly as the common four-clawed gecko, Pacific gecko, stump-toed gecko, sugar gecko in Indonesia, tender-skinned house gecko, and butiki in Filipino, is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is native to Southeast Asia. It has made its way to several areas of the world including Sri Lanka, Indochina, and many of the Pacific Islands. Compared to the common house gecko (&quot;Hemidactylus frenatus&quot;), the appearance of &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is somewhat plump, with delicate skin. The skin is usually colored a soft purplish/pinkish gray, with golden spots on younger specimens; these spots eventually fade with age.

==Description==

The head of &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is longer than broad. The snout is longer than the distance between the eye and the ear-opening, about 1.3 times the diameter of the orbit. The forehead has a median groove. The ear-opening is moderately large and suboval. The body and limbs are moderately elongate and depressed. A fold of the skin borders the hind limb posteriorly. The digits are short and more or less webbed at the base. The inferior lamellae are angular and divided by a median groove. The upper surface of the body and the throat are covered with small granular scales, which are largest and flat on the back. The abdominal scales are moderate. The rostral is quadrangular, broader than deep, with a median cleft above. The nostril is pierced between the rostral, the first labial, and three nasals, the upper much the largest and generally in contact with its fellow. There are 8 or 9 upper labials, and 6 or 7 lower labials. The mental is moderately large and pentagonal. There are 3 pairs of chin shields. The innermost pair is very large and elongate. The outermost pair is small, frequently broken up into small scales. The femoral pores are in a doubly curved line, angular in the middle, 14 to 19 on each side. The tail is depressed, normally with a sharpish, minutely serrated lateral edge. The upper surface of the tail is covered with very small flat scales. Its lower surface generally has a median series of large transversely dilated scales. &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is greyish or reddish brown above, uniform or dotted or variegated with darker. The lower surfaces are uniform whitish.

&quot;G. mutilata&quot; may attain a snout-to-vent length (SVL) of , with a tail length equal to SVL.

A key identification character is the absence of a claw on the innermost digit.

==Geographic range==
The species &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is widely distributed throughout Borneo, southeastern China, French Polynesia, Hawaii (Maui), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Mascarene Islands, western Mexico, Myanmar, Thailand, New Guinea, the Philippines, the Pitcairn Islands, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka.

==Behavior and habitat==
Like many other geckos, &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is very adaptable to its surroundings, although it usually prefers woodlands, rocky areas, and human dwellings, at altitudes from sea level to . It is also very common on sand beaches in Hawaii, where it is considered an invasive species. It makes itself at home in people&#x27;s houses, and doesn&#x27;t seem to mind the humans living beside it. Many people don&#x27;t mind the gecko either, perhaps because, being a nocturnally active species, it spends much of its time high up on walls and ceilings. It is quite unobtrusive and helpfully preys on household insects. 
Like many gecko species, &quot;G. mutilata&quot; is able to make noises to communicate. Its call, which sounds like &quot;tock&quot;, is repeated six to eight times with increasing volume. It is also capable of running faster than other house geckos.

&quot;G. mutilata&quot; are often compared to the common gecko (&quot;H. frenatus&quot;) when it comes to habitat location, and it is often said that &quot;G. mutilata&quot; will not be found around &quot;H. frenatus&quot; although this pattern can differ depending on location.

==Diet==
&quot;G. mutilata&quot; preys upon isopods, termites, and other small insects.

==Reproduction==
&quot;G. mutilata&quot; is oviparous. Clutch size is one to three eggs, usually two.

<doc id="525240" wikidata="Q1347624" url="?curid=525240" title="Post (Björk album)">
<text>Post is the second studio album by Icelandic singer Björk. It was released on 7 June 1995 by One Little Indian Records. Continuing the style developed on her first album &quot;Debut&quot; (1993), Björk conceived of &quot;Post&quot; as a bolder and more extroverted set of songs than its predecessor, featuring an eclectic mixture of electronic and dance styles such as techno, trip hop, IDM, and house, alongside that of ambient, jazz, industrial, and experimental music. Björk produced &quot;Post&quot; herself with co-producers including Nellee Hooper, 808 State&#x27;s Graham Massey, and former Massive Attack member Tricky. She wrote most of the songs after moving to London and intended the album to reflect her new life in the city.

The album reached number one in Iceland, number two in the United Kingdom and number 32 in the United States. It was certified gold in New Zealand and Sweden, and platinum in Australia, Canada, the US, and the UK. Six singles were released: &quot;Army of Me&quot;, &quot;Isobel&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;, &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, and &quot;I Miss You&quot;, with three reaching the UK top 10. Their accompanying music videos were noted for their surrealism, themes of nature and technology, and artistic development of the medium. A remix album titled &quot;Telegram&quot; was released in 1996.

During the album&#x27;s commercial peak, Björk was affected by media attention and &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s promotional tour. She assaulted a reporter and survived a murder attempt. Björk would relocate to Spain away from the press and produce her next album, &quot;Homogenic&quot; (1997). Considered an important exponent of art pop, &quot;Post&quot; has been praised by critics for its ambition and timelessness. It was named one of the greatest albums of 1995 by numerous publications, and has since been named one of the greatest albums of all time by publications including &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot;

==Recording and production==

Björk released her previous studio album &quot;Debut&quot; in 1993. At that time, she had moved to London. The production of &quot;Debut&quot; was &quot;long and laborious&quot;, as Björk sought to fully realise her compositional ideas from the past. After its release, she was free to concentrate on her present life for new musical clues for her following album. She contacted producer Nellee Hooper who had worked with her on &quot;Debut&quot;. He initially encouraged her to produce the album herself, but agreed when she insisted. Björk agreed to co-produce with other enlisted producers; &quot;to make it stay fresh, she had to think about other people being involved&quot;. With Hooper&#x27;s confirmation, Björk commenced work on the album in late 1994 at the Compass Point Studios in Nassau. The picturesque locale inspired Björk to meld the recording process with the exotic natural environment. For example, Björk waded into the ocean and recorded vocals while the sun set, captured by a digital recorder powered by a generator on the beach. The first version of &quot;Cover Me&quot; was recorded entirely from a cave.

Björk incorporated songs she had written in Manchester with 808 State&#x27;s Graham Massey before the recording of &quot;Debut&quot;. These included &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;The Modern Things&quot;, which she had performed live and did not need to be extensively changed. Björk said she left &quot;Army of Me&quot; off &quot;Debut&quot; as she felt &quot;Debut&quot; &quot;was a more gentle energy and &quot;Post&quot; was more raw, more brutal&quot;. Massey said: &quot;With &#x27;Army of Me&#x27; we wanted to try something that was quite hard and techno-y. I&#x27;m not sure how she wrote those lyrics so fast but I remember that song being almost instantaneous. [...] We kind of knocked that off in one day and then started on &#x27;The Modern Things&#x27; the same day and finished that the next.&quot; 
Although the album was supposed to be delivered the day after she returned from the Bahamas, Björk felt it was not yet complete and continued its production in London. She enlisted a new team of engineers and programmers, and spent the next months &quot;tweaking, rearranging, and sometimes completely rerecording her pre-existing tracks&quot;. Ultimately, it was the inclusion of more &quot;real&quot; instruments that &quot;resuscitated &quot;Post&quot; for Björk&quot;. Björk continued to compose songs such as &quot;Isobel&quot;, which was created while she was visiting Reykjavík for Christmas, before bringing it back to Hooper&#x27;s studio. The song&#x27;s lyrics were written in collaboration with Icelandic poet Sjón, which was his first songwriting experience. Sjón would become a frequent collaborator throughout Björk&#x27;s career. She also enlisted trip hop artist Tricky to assist in producing the album, on the condition that he would work on two tracks on her album and she would contribute two vocals for his album. Their collaboration resulted in the &quot;Post&quot; songs &quot;Enjoy&quot; and &quot;Headphones&quot;—in addition to &quot;Keep Your Mouth Shut&quot; and &quot;Yoga&quot;, which appeared on Tricky&#x27;s 1996 studio album, &quot;Nearly God&quot;.

The track that underwent the most extensive change was &quot;I Miss You&quot;, an old song from the &quot;Debut&quot; era. Howie Bernstein gave the song its &quot;Latin-tinged [rhythm]&quot;. Back in London, Björk contacted &quot;old standby&quot; Talvin Singh to record additional percussion parts for it. Fellow former Sugarcubes member Einar Örn Benediktsson was also contacted to play the trumpet on &quot;Enjoy&quot;. English sessionist Gary Barnacle was enlisted to play the saxophone. Although he had not been involved in music for a long time, Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato immediately agreed to participate on the album at Björk&#x27;s request. Björk decided to contact him after being impressed by his arrangements of a rare Milton Nascimento song called &quot;Travessia&quot;. Deodato&#x27;s presence as composer and conductor &quot;immediately bolstered&quot; &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot;. This addition of strings, brass and percussion elements gave &quot;Post&quot; the balance Björk felt her original recordings had lacked. &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; was the last track to be recorded. By the time the album was finished in April 1995, the list of co-producers included Björk, Hooper, Bernstein, Massey, and Tricky. Björk has said: &quot;The people I collaborated with were all people I was hanging out with in clubs in London. I had known them all for a while before we ended up working together.&quot;

==Composition==
===Musical style===

Björk&#x27;s website described &quot;Post&quot; as &quot;a bit of a bolder side of [Björk], who now had ventured all the way from Iceland to England, and was exploring the faster pace and big city life that this new country brought. This album became influenced of that and became more adventurous and club-friendly as a contrast to the shy first album, &quot;Debut.&quot;&quot; Likewise, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote in 2011 that &quot;&quot;Post&quot; tapped into the vortex of multicultural energy that was mid-90s London where she had relocated, and where strange hybrids such as jungle and trip-hop were bubbling&quot;. Noted for its eclectic nature, Björk described &quot;Post&quot; as &quot;musically promiscuous&quot; and &quot;spastic&quot;. Peter Tabakis of &quot;Pretty Much Amazing&quot; said that it has a protean form and &quot;wide emotional palette&quot;. While the album is recognised as an experimental work, it is also characterised by its accessibility and pop framework. &quot;Post&quot; has been described as art pop, experimental pop, and avant-pop.

&quot;Post&quot; touches on various musical styles, including industrial music, big-band jazz, trip hop, chillout, and experimental music. Jim Farber, reviewing the album in 1995 for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, considered &quot;Post&quot; to be a &quot;connecting point between industrial-disco, ambient-trance, and catchy synth pop&quot;. When asked if this variety of genres was intentional, Björk replied: &quot;Yes, I&#x27;m very aware of that. I&#x27;ve got very many sides to me.&quot; She recognises &quot;Post&quot; as darker and more aggressive than &quot;Debut&quot;, and has identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album—generated through the combination of electronic and &quot;real&quot; instruments—is a recurring characteristic of Björk&#x27;s output. In 1999, &quot;Vibe&quot; stated: &quot;Fusing techno, industrial, ambient, punk, and the rarefied yet tuneful spheres of art rock, Björk explores a jungle of tones, supported by her eternally buoyant voice from Mars.&quot; Part of the album&#x27;s innovation was Björk&#x27;s further embrace of electronic instrumentation, an interest established on &quot;Debut&quot;. While IDM and trip hop influences were present on &quot;Debut&quot;, &quot;Post&quot; is characterised by Björk&#x27;s fuller incorporation of these genres.

The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review stated that Björk &quot;[foraged] for inspiration in the soundscapes of orchestral jazz, ambient techno and classical&quot;. Influences of jazz fusion were also noted by a contemporary review by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 1996, when asked about the album&#x27;s musical influences, Björk stated: &quot;I&#x27;m influenced by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they&#x27;re comfortable or not. Everything.&quot;

===Songs===
The album opens with &quot;Army of Me&quot;, an aggressive song with industrial rock, and trip hop influences. It incorporates a looped drum sample of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;. Dedicated to Björk&#x27;s younger brother, the song&#x27;s lyrics are, according to Björk herself, &quot;about telling someone who is full of self-pity and doesn&#x27;t have anything together to get a life and stand up&quot;; as she sings: &quot;And if you complain once more/You&#x27;ll meet an army of me!&quot; &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, which incorporates a spectrum of electronic and orchestral styles, has been described as &quot;a love song penned by Aphex Twin&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; wrote that its music &quot;altered from gentle folktronica to drum and bass-tinted acid house&quot;; an attempt to reflect the song&#x27;s lyrics, which are about &quot;the art of not forgetting about yourself&quot;. In them, Björk describes living at the top of a mountain and going to a cliff at sunrise. She throws objects off the cliff while pondering her own suicide. The ritual allows her to exorcise darker thoughts and return to her partner. The track is followed by &quot;The Modern Things&quot;, a song that, in a magical realist tone, &quot;playfully posits the theory that technology has always existed, waiting in mountains for humans to catch up&quot;. &quot;Interview&quot; described it in 1995 as a &quot;spooky tune&quot;, noting &quot;the odd scratchings at the end&quot; of the track. In a startling shift in style, the big band track &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; covers a German composition made famous by Betty Hutton. It has been described as &quot;a palate-cleanser during the course of the record&quot;. Björk included the song &quot;just to make it absolutely certain that the album would be as schizophrenic as possible, that every song would be a shock&quot;.

The following track, &quot;Enjoy&quot;, a song concerning the links between sex and fear, has been considered &quot;decidedly trippy&quot;, and &quot;&quot;Post&quot;″s most abrasive track&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; described it in its 1995 review as, &quot;a dark and deranged techno thing&quot;. Over military drums and &quot;squalls of noise&quot;, Björk sings about &quot;her hedonistic tendencies&quot;. The orchestral interlude &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot;, like the previous track &quot;Enjoy&quot;, features &quot;mysterious or open-ended lyrics&quot;. They are an attempt to describe the ambiguous nature of flirting. &quot;Isobel&quot; is a string-laden, orchestral trip hop song, Craig McLean of &quot;The Face&quot; called the track &quot;Broadway on breakbeats&quot;. Conceived by Björk as &quot;part autobiography part storytelling&quot;, its lyrics concern Isobel, a woman magically born in a forest who finds people in the city &quot;a bit too clever for her&quot;, eventually retreating back to nature and sending them a message of instinct through trained moths. Inspired by South American literature—particularly Gabriel García Márquez—the track&#x27;s lyrics discuss &quot;the duality between reason and emotions, between intuition and intellect&quot;; in Björk&#x27;s words, &quot;asking how 20th century civilisation clashes with nature and, in places like Iceland and Thailand, people really believe they can have a TV remote control in one hand and a ghost sitting beside them&quot;.

&quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; is an ambient dub track that fuses trip-hop and chill-out music. Björk has said that it was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: &quot;That was very hard for me. [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope&quot;. Its lyrics document the various stages of Björk&#x27;s ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. With the track, De Vries &quot;create[d] a vinyl-crackling ambience, full of glissando strings and leaden, muted bass. The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an &quot;ambient country&quot; sound inspired by Chris Isaak&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Game&quot;. &quot;I Miss You&quot; was described in 1997 as an &quot; of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing&quot;. A house music number, its &quot;horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [its] lyrics&quot;. Björk wrote &quot;Cover Me&quot;, one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he agreed to participate in the making of &quot;Post&quot;. She has said: &quot;I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also thing from me to him&quot;. The album ends with the experimental &quot;Headphones&quot;, an ambient track. Featuring &quot;just-for-headphones studio tricks&quot;, it has been described as &quot;a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk&#x27;s heavy-lidded pre-dream state&quot;. Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. She also stated: &quot;But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing&quot;.

==Title==
Björk said the title &quot;Post&quot; refers to the fact that all the songs were written after her move to England, while the she wrote the songs of &quot;Debut&quot; during the previous ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: &quot;I always knew it would be two albums and that&#x27;s why I called them &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;. Before and after.&quot; The title also has the meaning of &quot;mail&quot;, inspired by Björk&#x27;s desire to communicate with friends and family in Iceland.

== Artwork ==
Me Company designed the album artwork, while Martin Gardiner modeled the lotus flower in the booklet and packaging. The album depicts Björk in Piccadilly Circus, London, her pale skin and dark hair contrasting with the colours of the Japanese-inspired signs behind her. The photograph was taken on 1 April 1995 by Stéphane Sednaoui. The designer Paul White of Me Company, who had collaborated with Björk since her time with the Sugarcubes, &quot;surrounded her with giant postcards to represent communication with friends and family&quot;. Björk said &quot;my musical heart was scattered at the time and I wanted the [cover] to show that&quot;.

The jacket Björk wears was inspired by Royal Mail airmail envelopes, referencing the album title. It was specially crafted from Tyvek envelope paper by the designer Hussein Chalayan. The jacket is displayed under glass at Hard Rock Reykjavík, and was part of the 2015 &quot;Björk&quot; exhibition in the Museum of Modern Art, New York City. &quot;Vice&quot; identified the airmail jacket as one of the &quot;ultimate fashion moments&quot; of Björk&#x27;s career. A photograph of Björk surrounded by silver balls was planned as the cover, but it was scrapped in favour of something &quot;more poppy&quot;. The photo later appeared in a 1995 article for &quot;The Face&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Post&quot; was released on 7 June 1995, as a 12&quot; record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued &quot;Post&quot; in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. In September 1995, Björk and poet Sjón released &quot;Post&quot;, a paperback book meant to be a &quot;pictorial and verbal record of the making of that album&quot;. It contained interviews with Björk and also focused on the European leg of the tour. The Post tour was her first proper North American tour as a solo artist, with Aphex Twin as her opening act. While in the United States, she also appeared on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;; this tour &quot;helped maintain &quot;Post&quot;″s momentum and keep Björk in the public eye&quot;, since airings of &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;Isobel&quot; had been relegated primarily to after-hours alternative music shows in MTV. In the United Kingdom, Björk also performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on several occasions. In 1996, Björk took part in Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot lunaire&quot;, conducted by Kent Nagano and the Opera orchestra of Lyon. In addition, Björk also appeared in several music magazines.

In November 1996, Björk released the &quot;often-delayed&quot; remix project &quot;Telegram&quot;, which contained reworkings of several songs from &quot;Post&quot;, with her voice re-recorded. &quot;Telegram&quot; has been described as &quot;effectively a completely new album&quot;. Author Mark Pytlik writes, &quot;Promises of a &quot;Post&quot; remix album had been circulating since the release of &quot;Army of Me&quot; in April 1995. To compensate, Björk announced the release of a string of 12″ remixes beginning in June, limited to only 1,000 copies each. Producers and musicians featured on &quot;Telegram&quot; include: Dillinja, Eumir Deodato, LFO, and Graham Massey, among others; Björk only remixed &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot; herself. The album also contains a new composition, &quot;My Spine&quot;, a collaboration with British percussionist Evelyn Glennie. &quot;Telegram&quot; spent five weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, peaking at number 66. In the UK, it peaked at number 59, spending two weeks on the albums chart.

In 2005, the UNICEF charity record &quot;Army of Me: Remixes and Covers&quot; was released; it is a collection of seventeen eclectic remixes of &quot;Army of Me&quot;. All profits went directly to the charity, to assist the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. &quot;Live at Shepherds Bush Empire&quot; was released as a VHS in November 1998, containing the last performance of the Post tour, which took place at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire in February 1997. &quot;Post Live&quot;, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Post tour, was included in the 2003 box set &quot;Live Box&quot;. The 2002 box set &quot;Family Tree&quot; includes demos and alternate versions of various tracks off the album. &quot;Post&quot; has been reissued several times, adapting to different formats such as colored records, 180g vinyl, and DualDisc. A remastered version of the album in surround sound was included in the box set &quot;Surrounded&quot;, which was released in 2006 on Elektra Records. In 2012, Universal Japan issued a limited edition of &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; together as one compilation . All of &quot;Post&quot;″s music videos were included on the 1998 video release &quot;Volumen&quot;, and its 2002 reissue &quot;Volumen Plus&quot;. They also appear on &quot;Greatest Hits – Volumen 1993–2003&quot;, a release that includes the videos featured on &quot;Volumen&quot; and &quot;Volumen Plus&quot;. They are also featured on video compilations of its directors, including &quot;The Work of Director Michel Gondry&quot; and &quot;The Work of Director Spike Jonze&quot;, all of them from 2003.

==Singles==
&quot;Army of Me&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Post&quot; on 24 April 1995, shortly after the album&#x27;s production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with &quot;Cover Me&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot;, &quot;Sweet Intuition&quot;, and various remixes as its B-sides. A commercial success, it peaked atop the Íslenski Listinn Topp 40, as well as at numbers five and ten in Finland and the United Kingdom, respectively. In the United States, it peaked at number 21 on the Alternative Airplay chart. Michel Gondry directed the video for &quot;Army of Me&quot;, which takes place in a cyberpunk environment. In the video, Björk is seen driving a massive truck, which has been described as &quot;alternately [looking] like an overgrown SUV and a science fiction tank&quot; as she quests to rescue her loved one from an art museum.

&quot;Isobel&quot; was released as the second single on 14 August, with B-sides &quot;Charlene&quot;, &quot;I Go Humble&quot;, &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot;, and several remixes. Although the record company was against the idea of releasing &quot;Isobel&quot;, Björk insisted because she &quot;felt intuitively that this was the right choice&quot;. However, &quot;Isobel&quot; did not replicate the success of &quot;Army of Me&quot;, peaking at number two in Iceland and number 23 in the UK. The music video for &quot;Isobel&quot;, directed by Gondry &quot;Isobel&quot; represents the story of the title character Björk envisioned with Sjón. It tells the story of &quot;a wild child discovering urban culture through installations of toy fighter planes&quot;, over lush superimposed imagery. Like in the lyrics, where Björk takes the role of narrator and protagonist, she plays two different parts in the music video: Björk is seen as the Isobel who &quot;weaves and composes this world and this story on her organ&quot;, and as the Isobel who inhabits this primal world.

&quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; was released as the third single on 13 November. Its B-sides included &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot;, &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, &quot;Sweet Sweet Intuition&quot; (a rework of &quot;Sweet Intuition&quot;), and &quot;My Spine&quot;. The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; became one of the most played clips on MTV, and the song became Björk&#x27;s most successful single, peaking at number one in Iceland and within the top ten in Australia, Finland, Ireland, Scotland and the UK, while peaking at number nine on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&#x27;s extension Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The single was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 400,000 units in the UK. Spike Jonze directed the music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;, a homage to Hollywood&#x27;s Technicolor musicals that drew inspiration from Busby Berkeley and Jacques Demy&#x27;s &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. Like Demy, Jonze &quot;mines the magical from the mundane,&quot; as he transforms a drab auto shop into the location where Björk dances and sings with a full dance company, an attempt to reflect the &quot;exuberance&quot; of her vocal performance.

&quot;Hyperballad&quot; was released as the fourth single on 12 February 1996. The single—consisting of two separate CDs—also included remixes of the song, &quot;Isobel&quot; and &quot;Cover Me&quot;. Some regions also included a double A-side single with the song &quot;Enjoy&quot;, although it only received a number of promo remixes. It peaked at number eight on the UK Singles Chart and atop the US Dance Club Songs. The music video for &quot;Hyperballad&quot;, also directed by Gondry, has been described as &quot;a techno-dream visual story full of flashing lights, buzzing static, and holograms.&quot; It shows Björk as &quot;a character running through a landscape that simulates that of a computer game, only to throw herself off a cliff.&quot; The clip is an attempt to reflect the song&#x27;s story, so Gondry depicted Björk lying down as a dead body, with a holographic image of her singing superimposed on her.

&quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; was released as the fifth single on 28 October via several 12-inch records and three different CD releases. A limited-edition 12-inch double A-side with remixes of &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot; (by Mark Bell and Dom T., respectively) was also released. &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; peaked at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Sednaoui directed the music video for &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, despite the song being about his failed relationship with Björk. Björk and Sednaoui had previously worked together in the music video for &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot;. In the clip, she appears &quot;as a goddess, floating out from a numinous light-streaked background.&quot; Sednaoui is known for having a particularly filmic technique for each of his clips; in &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, the use of blacklighting &quot;makes Björk glow sensuously and perversely&quot;. It was conceived in a theatrical way: nearly all of the scenes were filmed in the same space, which is transformed with changes in the &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;. The style of &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;&#x27;s scenery and Björk&#x27;s wardrobe reference East Asian imagery, and a Japanese traditional doll is featured as Björk&#x27;s only accompaniment; as a silent witness, it is the object on which the protagonist casts reflections on her own identity. Regarding the video, Sednaoui said: &quot;Her song and my video were a way of saying things to each other that we couldn&#x27;t say otherwise.&quot;

&quot;I Miss You&quot; was released as the sixth and final single on 17 February 1997. Although it became Björk&#x27;s third US Dance Club Songs number-one single, it was the least successful single from &quot;Post&quot; in Europe, as it peaked only at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart. The animation of its music video was produced by John Kricfalusi and directed by Erik Weiss. It was promptly censored on MTV because of its nudity and violence towards the end.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Post&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics. Lorraine Ali of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album for differentiating from the alternative rock offerings of the early 1990s, and for successfully merging disparate styles. She concluded: &quot;When &quot;Post&quot; comes to an end, it feels like getting back from a good vacation: the last thing you want to do is re-enter the real world&quot;. Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Jim Farber stated that despite &quot;Post&quot;″s &quot;bizarre&quot; combination of diverse genres, the conviction of Björk&#x27;s delivery and assuring hooks &quot;[made] her most surreal passages as relatable as moon-June standards&quot;. He felt that Björk &quot;[reinvented] that tradition, constructing standards for the cyber age&quot;.

Joy Press, who reviewed the album for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the album for not being a &quot;play-safe sequel&quot; to &quot;Debut&quot;, pointing out that Björk, &quot;[had] followed her most wonderfully wayward impulses&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Richard Cromelin felt that &quot;Post&quot; was &quot;an often heady mix of trendiness and nostalgia&quot; that was capable of transcending Björk&#x27;s self-consciousness. Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; found the album&#x27;s backing tracks to be &quot;even more varied and unusual&quot; than on &quot;Debut&quot;, describing Björk as &quot;an extra-terrestrial voice rummaging around in a sonic toybox&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Barry Walters felt the album was an improvement over its predecessor, stating its songs were &quot;stronger, more developed, and less reliant on Björk&#x27;s wide-eyed delivery&quot;. He concluded that: &quot;After years of (no) alternative fascist grunge domination, it&#x27;s heartening that Björk and producer-co-songwriter Nellee Hooper stayed true to themselves and created another highly personal album that has a chance of interrupting the airwave flow of whiny rockers with little imagination&quot;.

Writing for MTV Online, Lou Stathis wrote that, &quot;[it&#x27;s mostly] Björk&#x27;s wacky, mind-altered perspective that makes &quot;Post&quot; modern pop music at once both baffling and engaging&quot;. He believed that the album was a rewarding experience for both the casual consumer, as well as the serious listener, also pointing out that, &quot;it not only sounds good while you&#x27;re listening to it, but it leaves you feeling good when it&#x27;s over, too&quot;. Robert Christgau, reviewing the album for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, was less enthusiastic. He found that the album&#x27;s &quot;eccentric instrumentation&quot; and &quot;electronic timbres&quot; failed to compensate for its lack of &quot;groove&quot; and was unmoved by Björk&#x27;s lyrics, which he said &quot;might hit home harder if she&#x27;d grown up speaking the English she&#x27;ll die singing, but probably wouldn&#x27;t&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Post&quot; reached the top ten of several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. &quot;Post&quot; also peaked at number two on the European Top 100 Albums chart. The album peaked at number 32 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, almost 30 places higher than the peak position of its predecessor &quot;Debut&quot;. It also received an enthusiastic reception from college radios. &quot;Post&quot; also reached top 40 in Hungary and Japan. The album was certified platinum in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Europe; and gold in Sweden and New Zealand. In 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;Post&quot; had sold 810,000 units in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan; it had sold 36,000 additional copies by 2015.

==Controversies==
The music video for &quot;Army of Me&quot; was removed from MTV&#x27;s playlist before it aired because its ending depicted Björk bombing an art museum; the Oklahoma City bombing happened at this time. Author Mark Pytlik wrote that this &quot;foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder &quot;Post&quot;″s unveiling&quot;.

An unsourced sample by Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot;, resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud&#x27;s label New Electronica refused a sample clearance compensation of £1,000 from One Little Indian founder Derek Birkett, Björk and Birkett resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album to create a new version without the sample. However, at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica gave Björk permission to use the sample.

Musician Simon Fisher sued Hooper and Björk over writing credits in &quot;Debut&quot; (1993), but these charges were cleared by judge Robin Jacob. According to Pytlik, these events resulted in &quot;the strangest promotional tour anyone could have ever envisioned: in the week since &quot;Post&quot; had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her&quot;. One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.

During the &quot;Post&quot; era, the extensive media attention and a world tour of 105 dates began to affect Björk. She repeatedly complained about the intrusiveness of tabloids and reporters. On tour in February 1996, Björk arrived at Bangkok International Airport with her son Sindri after a long flight. While the pair walked through the arrival terminals, reporter Julie Kaufman approached them and said, &quot;Welcome to Bangkok!&quot; Björk charged at Kaufman and wrestled her to the ground. It was later reported Kaufman had been bothering Björk and Sindri for days prior. The incident was reported around the world.

On 12 September, an obsessed American fan, Ricardo López, sent a letter bomb rigged with sulfuric acid to Björk&#x27;s residence in London, returned home and filmed his suicide. Police contacted Scotland Yard, who intercepted the package without incident. To record in privacy away from the unwanted interest of the press, Björk&#x27;s tour drummer Trevor Morais offered her his studio in Málaga, Spain, to record her next album, &quot;Homogenic&quot;.

==Impact and legacy==
Nick Coleman of &quot;The Independent&quot; considered &quot;Post&quot; to be an important release of the art pop genre, Retrospectively, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Eric Henderson argued that &quot;Post&quot; &quot;will likely always remain the Björk album that most successfully sustains her winning balance of experimental whimsy and solid pop magic&quot;, while Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that the record was &quot;not simply &quot;Debut&quot; redux&quot; and concluded: &quot;The work of a constantly changing artist, &quot;Post&quot; proves that as Björk moves toward more ambitious, complex music, she always surpasses herself&quot;. Celebrating the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, the British magazine &quot;NME&quot; described it as, &quot;a masterful matching of hard, up-to-the-minute beats with complex, personal lyrics about the rush and rage of being a modern urban woman&quot;.

The album&#x27;s influence has been identified as being increasingly palpable on the contemporary music landscape, and later reviews of the album also make note of the timeless aspect of the music. Writing for &quot;The Daily Review&quot;, James Rose wrote in 2015: &quot;&quot;Post&quot; is where mainstream music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn&#x27;t gone there entirely[,] she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. [The album] stands today as a body of work that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk. Also in 2015, Andrew Shaw of Nerdist felt that &quot;Post&quot; &quot;chose to ignore expectation, market restrictions, and contemporary trends&quot;, and that Björk &quot;pushed her vocal performances into new places, where no other vocalists could dare to sing&quot;. He compared the album&#x27;s impact on audiences to that of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s 1967 album, &quot;Are You Experienced&quot;, writing it &quot;set the benchmark for what was possible when you take tradition and set it on fire&quot;. Raymond Ang of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; considered &quot;Post&quot; to be &quot;Björk&#x27;s last stab at the pop game… she would dig deeper into her increasingly avant-garde interests and, in the years to come, thrill and challenge her audience&quot;.

David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors is an admirer of the record, stating he was influenced by Björk&#x27;s deconstruction of classic melodies. American singer-songwriter Amy Lee has said &quot;Post&quot; is &quot;one of the biggest records in [her] life&quot;. DJ Shadow sampled &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; in &quot;Mutual Slump&quot;, a track off his 1996 album, &quot;Endtroducing...&quot;. The Vitamin String Quartet—known for its series of tribute albums to rock and pop acts—covered &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Flirting Again&quot; in the 2001 album, &quot;Ice: The String Tribute to Björk&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Stereogum&quot; released a compilation of cover versions in homage to the album, titled &quot;&quot;. It features: Dirty Projectors, Liars, Xiu Xiu, High Places and Atlas Sound, among other artists.

Much of &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s six music videos have gone on to become classics—most notably &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; and &quot;Army of Me&quot;. At the time of its release, music videos were beginning to be used as an art form, and Björk&#x27;s visual output during this period—and her career in general—have become a clear example of the medium&#x27;s artistic legitimation. Spanish writer Estíbaliz Pérez Asperilla has identified recurring motifs and themes through Björk&#x27;s videography; these include nature and a magnified depiction of Björk. Surrealism and technology have also been identified as recurring features in Björk&#x27;s visual output of this period. David Ehrlich of &quot;Time Out&quot; considered her &quot;one of the first artists to meaningfully explore the aesthetic and semiotic value of CG and its relationship to the [videos].&quot; Writing for &quot;Paste&quot;, Alexa Carrasco felt, &quot;Björk has created some of the most beautiful and weird videos to ever play on MTV.&quot; The popularity of the music video for &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; made the song one of Björk&#x27;s most ubiquitous tracks, and was considered her first breakthrough on MTV. The music videos—and the pink boots Björk wears in &quot;Hyperballad&quot; (the work of Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck)—were displayed in the Museum of Modern Art, New York City, as part of the 2015 &quot;Björk&quot; exhibition. They were also featured in the 2016 exhibition, &quot;Björk Digital&quot;, which premiered at Carriageworks as part of the Vivid Sydney festival.

In 2008, when asked how she felt about the album in retrospect, Björk reflected: &quot;I was kinda surprised how the odd spastic thing of the album had actually aged well.&quot;

==Accolades==
By the end of 1995, &quot;Post&quot; appeared on the year-end lists of multiple publications. In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1995, the album placed at number seven. At the 1995 Icelandic Music Awards, &quot;Post&quot; received the award for Album of the Year; Björk was also awarded Artist of the Year, Female Singer of the Year, Composer of the Year, and was nominated for Songwriter of the Year. Additionally, &quot;Army of Me&quot; received the Song of the Year award, with &quot;Isobel&quot; also being nominated. She also received the Best Female award at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards,
 and Best International Female at the Rockbjörnen Awards. Björk was also nominated for the Nordic Council Music Prize. In 1996, she received her second Best International Female Solo Artist award at the 16th Brit Awards. She received the same distinction at the Danish Music Awards, the International Dance Music Awards, and the Italian Music Prize. In 1996, &quot;Post&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, was awarded an IFPI Platinum Europe Award, and the ASCAP Vanguard Award given by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. For the album&#x27;s music videos, &quot;Army of Me&quot; was nominated for Best Special Effects in a Video and the International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot; was nominated for the Best Music Video award at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, losing to Janet and Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Scream&quot;. At the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was awarded the Best Choreography in a Video award, and was nominated for Best Female Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction, Best Art Direction in a Video, and International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award (MTV Europe).

&quot;Vibe&quot; included the album in its 1999 list of the 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; considered it the second best album of the decade in a 2011 list, only behind Björk&#x27;s next release, &quot;Homogenic&quot;, writing it: &quot;is [her] most scatterbrained work to date, but it&#x27;s tied together flawlessly by [Björk&#x27;s] singular whimsicality&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it as the 20th best album of the decade, with William Morris writing, &quot;few artists on this list could rival [Björk] in terms of innovation, vision, talent, and high-yield experimentation, and &quot;Post&quot; was the record to establish this.&quot; In a 2012 article, &quot;Paste&quot; considered &quot;Post&quot; to be the sixty-fourth best album of the decade, with Ryan Reed stating: &quot;no Björk album is as weird (or weirdly wonderful) as 1995&#x27;s &quot;Post&quot;, a dizzying whirlwind of sonic textures and stylistic shifts that demonstrates every facet of her ever-expanding bag of tricks. [...] Björk clearly aimed to demonstrate the meaninglessness of genre boundaries. She succeeded.&quot; &quot;Post&quot; was ranked at number 376 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list, with the publication praising its &quot;utter lack of musical inhibition,&quot; and ranked at number 289 on the 2020 updated list. The American publication &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; placed the album at number seventy-nine on their 2010 list of the Top 100 Albums Ever, with Harry Painter writing: &quot;Björk is one of few artists who could put out an album juxtaposing blistering electro-pop with big band, club-ready tribal dance with downtempo trip-hop and find both critical and commercial success.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Post&quot; placed on number 69 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s list of the 300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years, claiming that &quot;[Björk&#x27;s] fearless plunge into styles is matched by the aplomb with which she bares her anxieties and aspirations.&quot; Also in 2008, &quot;FNAC&quot; placed the album at number 246 in its list of the 1000 best albums of all time. In an unordered list of 500 essential albums compiled for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 2013, English musician Elvis Costello included &quot;Post&quot; and mentioned &quot;Hyperballad&quot; as a highlight of the record. In the album&#x27;s entry of the &quot;Women Who Rock: The 50 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; list of 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt, &quot;Björk&#x27;s artistic stature grew by yards in the course of this strange, affecting work, by turns harshly industrial, meditative and neon jubilant.&quot;

<text>Robert Smigel (born February 7, 1960) is an American actor, comedian, writer, director, producer, and puppeteer, known for his &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; cartoon shorts and as the puppeteer and voice behind Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. He also co-wrote the first two &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; films, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot;, and &quot;Leo&quot;, all starring Adam Sandler.

==Early life==
Robert Smigel was born in New York City, to Lucia and Irwin Smigel, an aesthetic dentist, innovator and philanthropist. He is Jewish and frequently went to Jewish summer camp. He attended Cornell University, studying pre-dental, and graduated from New York University&#x27;s College of Arts and Science in 1983 with a degree in political science.

Smigel began developing his comedic talent at The Players Workshop in Chicago, where he studied improvisation with Josephine Forsberg. Bob Odenkirk was a fellow student there. Smigel was also a member of the Chicago comedy troupe &quot;All You Can Eat&quot; in the early 1980s.

==Career==
Smigel first established himself as a writer on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by joining the writing staff when Lorne Michaels returned as executive producer for the 1985–1986 season. Smigel was hired after then-&quot;SNL&quot; producers Al Franken and Tom Davis saw Smigel in a Chicago sketch show. Smigel was among the few writers who survived a purge of writers and cast at the conclusion of the &quot;disappointing&quot; 1985–1986 season. This is when Smigel began to write more memorable sketches, including one where host William Shatner urged worshipful attendees at a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention to &quot;get a life.&quot; Smigel rarely appeared on screen, though he was credited as a featured player in the early 1990s and played a recurring character in the Bill Swerski&#x27;s Superfans sketches.

While on a writers&#x27; strike from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; following the 1987–88 season, Smigel wrote for an improvisational comedy revue in Chicago with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; writers Bob Odenkirk and Conan O&#x27;Brien called &quot;Happy Happy Good Show&quot;.

Smigel co-wrote &quot;Lookwell&quot; with Conan O&#x27;Brien for NBC. The pilot never went to series, but it has become a cult hit and has screened live at &quot;The Other Network&quot;, a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by Un-Cabaret, featuring live and taped intros by Smigel. Smigel later became the first head writer at &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, where he created numerous successful comedy bits, including one where Smigel performed only the lips of public figures which were superimposed on photos of the actual people. (This technique was pioneered on the &quot;Clutch Cargo&quot; cartoon series as a cost-saving measure, and was known as Syncro-Vox.)

In 1996, Smigel wrote and performed on the short-lived &quot;Dana Carvey Show&quot;, a primetime sketch comedy program on ABC. Despite its premature end, the show provided Smigel the opportunity to debut his first cartoon &quot;The Ambiguously Gay Duo&quot;. Upon the show&#x27;s cancellation, Smigel continued developing more cartoon ideas the following summer and would begin airing them on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; under the &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; banner. Smigel would later claim &quot;My whole career came out of the impulse to do cartoons on &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;.&quot;

Smigel&#x27;s most famous creation, however, would be the foul-mouthed puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who mercilessly mocks celebrities and others in the style of a Borscht Belt comedian. This character debuted on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in February 1997 and would continue to make appearances on the show, as well as others, for many years to come.

Smigel continued to establish himself on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by producing short animated segments under the title &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, which usually satirizes public figures and popular culture. It spawned a TV show on Comedy Central featuring a mix of puppets, animation, and short sketches, although only eight episodes were aired (during the winter of 2000–2001). Smigel occasionally appears in films (usually alongside &quot;SNL&quot; veterans such as Adam Sandler). According to interviews, Smigel helped punch up the scripts for &quot;Little Nicky&quot; and &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;. Smigel acted alongside fellow &quot;SNL&quot; writer Bob Odenkirk in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; as a nerd backstage at an Aerosmith concert. His contributions were uncredited.

In 2000, he voiced a sage bulldog named Mr. Beefy in &quot;Little Nicky&quot;. Smigel, along with Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow, wrote the script for the film &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess with the Zohan&quot; in which Smigel played Yosi, an Israeli electronics salesman. Smigel is also one of the executive producers of the film, which is a first for him despite his frequent collaborations with Sandler.

It was reported in 2006 that Smigel and Adam Sandler were working on an animated sitcom for Fox called &quot;Animals&quot;. Fox has not made any official statement regarding the show. Additionally, Smigel played a gay mailman in the Adam Sandler film &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot; and Yari the Mechanic in the &quot;Mister Softee&quot; episode of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;.

He voiced Ray and the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character, Emperor Palpatine, in the first episode of &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot;, as well as the monster One Hundred in the episode of the same name of &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;.

Currently living in New York, he co-wrote and co-executive produced the films &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; (2012) and &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot; (2015), in which he voiced Marty, a fake version of Dracula, and Harry Three-Eye, respectively. In the fifth season of the FX show, &quot;Louie&quot;, Smigel received a story credit on the episode &quot;Cop Story&quot;, as a similar incident as to what appears in the show actually happened to him, down to the cop crying in his apartment while Smigel went out, found the missing gun and carried it home, terrified that anyone would notice. Michael Rapaport&#x27;s character Lenny wasn&#x27;t based on the man Smigel knew, however, since all Smigel ever told Louis C.K. about was the gun itself.

Smigel created, wrote, executive produced, and starred as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog in &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot;, alongside Jack McBrayer in 2015. It was announced in January 2016 that Smigel would be starring as Triumph in &quot;Triumph&#x27;s Election Special 2016&quot; on Hulu the following February.

In September 2020, after being brought on to develop the project in 2019, Fox announced that Smigel would executive produce &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Real&quot; — a one-off adaptation of the French satirical series &quot;Les Guignols&quot;.

On June 16, 2022, Smigel was arrested for unlawful entry of the Longworth House Office Building in Washington, D.C., along with eight other individuals associated with &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. CBS released a statement saying that “Their interviews at the Capitol were authorized and pre-arranged through Congressional aides of the members interviewed&quot;, and that &quot;After leaving the members’ offices on their last interview of the day, the production team stayed to film stand-ups and other final comedy elements in the halls when they were detained by Capitol Police.” Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson accused Smigel of &quot;insurrection&quot; and that it was &quot;exactly like what happened&quot; in apparent reference to the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Stephen Colbert addressed the incident in his monologue, stating that Smigel had committed &quot;First-Degree Puppetry&quot; and that &quot;Drawing any equivalence between rioters storming our Capitol to prevent the counting of electoral ballots and a cigar-chomping toy dog is a shameful and grotesque insult to the memory of everyone who died.” The United States Capitol Police released a statement saying that “This is an active criminal investigation, and may result in additional criminal charges after consultation with the U.S. Attorney.” On July 19, it was announced no charges would be filed.

==Personal life==
Smigel met his wife, Michelle Saks, when she worked as a lighting technician for the theater in Chicago where he performed as part of the comedy troupe &quot;All You Can Eat and the Temple of &quot;. 
They have three children together. 

Smigel and Saks serve on the board of NEXT for AUTISM, formerly New York Collaborates for Autism, a non-profit organization founded in 2003 to address the needs of autistic individuals and their families, as their eldest child has autism. Smigel created the &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot;, a biannual celebrity fundraiser to benefit autism education. He won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program for the 2012 broadcast of &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot; at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards.

<doc id="525251" wikidata="Q881662" url="?curid=525251" title="Blank cheque">
<text>A blank cheque or blank check in the literal sense is a cheque that has no monetary value written in, but is already signed. In the figurative sense, it is used to describe a situation in which an agreement has been made that is open-ended or vague, and therefore subject to abuse, or in which a party is willing to consider any expense in the pursuance of their goals. The term carte blanche () is used in a similar way.

== Literal meaning ==
Cheque writers are advised to specify the amount of the cheque before signing it. A blank cheque can be extremely expensive for the drawer who writes the cheque, because whoever obtains the cheque could write in any amount of money, and might be able to cash it (if the current account or checking account contains sufficient funds, and depending on the laws in the specific country). Under American law, a blank cheque is an example of an &quot;&quot; as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code&#x27;s Article 3, Section 115 (a). Writing an amount in a blank cheque, without the authority of the signer, is an &quot;alteration&quot;. It is legally equivalent to changing the numbers on a completed (non-blank) cheque.

==Metaphorical meaning==

===In finance===
A &quot;blank cheque company&quot; refers to a company in development that has no specific business plan, such as a special-purpose acquisition company.

===In politics===
* On July 5, 1914, Germany gave Austria a &quot;blank cheque&quot; in handling its punishment of Serbia regarding the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne. It led to the start of the First World War. German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg told the Austrian ambassador in Berlin that the Austrian Emperor had the support of the German Kaiser:
*In March 2003, Gordon Brown, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, &quot;effectively offered a blank cheque for war against Iraq&quot;, and would thus spend what it takes&#x27; to tackle Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction&quot;.

===In literature===
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle used the term &quot;carte blanche&quot; in several of his Sherlock Holmes stories.

* &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Then, as to money?&quot;
&quot;You have carte blanche.&quot;
&quot;Absolutely?&quot;
&quot;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

* &quot;The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet&quot;:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw.&quot;
&quot;I would give my fortune to have them back.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Dame Agatha Christie uses the term &quot;carte blanche&quot; in her first published book where she introduced Hercule Poirot to the reading public.

* &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; Chapter XII The Last Link:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Madame, I have your permission to hold a little reunion in the salon? It is necessary for everyone to attend.&quot;
Mary smiled sadly.
&quot;You know, Monsieur Poirot, that you have carte blanche in every way.&quot;
&quot;You are too amiable, madame.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="525290" wikidata="Q623624" url="?curid=525290" title="T. Keith Glennan">
<text>Thomas Keith Glennan (September 8, 1905 – April 11, 1995) was the first Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, serving from August 19, 1958 to January 20, 1961.

==Early career==
Born in Enderlin, North Dakota, the son of Richard and Margaret Glennan, he attended the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire and then earned a degree in electrical engineering from the Sheffield Scientific School of Yale University in 1927, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. Following graduation, he became associated with the newly developed sound motion picture industry, and later became assistant general service superintendent for Electrical Research Products Company, a subsidiary of Western Electric Company. During his career he was studio manager of Paramount Pictures, and Samuel Goldwyn Studios, and was briefly on the staff of Vega Aircraft Corporation.

Glennan joined the Columbia University Division of War Research in 1942, serving throughout World War II, first as Administrator and then as Director of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Underwater Sound Laboratories at New London, Connecticut. At the end of the war, Glennan became an executive of the Ansco Corp. in Binghamton, New York. From this position he was called to the presidency of the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio. During his administration, Case rose from a primarily local institution to rank with the top engineering schools in the United States. From October 1950 to November 1952, concurrent with his Case presidency, he served as a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.

==Administration==
As NASA Administrator, Glennan presided over an organization that had absorbed the earlier National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) intact; its 8,000 employees, an annual budget of $100 million, and three major research laboratories—Langley Aeronautical Laboratory, Ames Aeronautical Laboratory, and Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory—and two small test facilities made up the core of the new NASA.

Within a short time after NASA&#x27;s formal organization, Glennan incorporated several organizations involved in space exploration projects from other federal agencies into NASA to ensure that a viable scientific program of space exploration could be reasonably conducted over the long-term. He brought in part of the Naval Research Laboratory in NASA and created for its use the Goddard Space Flight Center.

He also incorporated several disparate satellite programs, two lunar probes, and the research effort to develop a million pound force (4.4 MN) thrust, single-chamber rocket engine from the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency. In December 1958 Glennan also acquired control of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a contractor facility operated by the California Institute of Technology. In 1960, Glennan obtained the transfer to NASA of the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, located at Huntsville, Alabama, and renamed it the Marshall Space Flight Center.

By mid-1960, Glennan had secured for NASA primacy in the federal government for the execution of all space activities except reconnaissance satellites, ballistic missiles, and a few other space-related projects, most of which were still in the study stage, that the Defense Department controlled.

==Later career==
Upon leaving NASA in January 1961, Glennan returned to the Case Institute of Technology, where he continued to serve as president until 1966. During this period he helped to negotiate the merger of Case with Western Reserve University, creating Case Western Reserve University. After his retirement in 1966, Glennan spent two years as president of Associated Universities, Inc., a Washington-based advocate for institutions of higher education.

A resident of Reston, Virginia for twenty years after his retirement, he moved to Mitchellville, Maryland in the late 1980s. He died at Collington Life Care Community in Mitchellville in April 1995, after a stroke. He was survived by his wife, Ruth (née Adams) Glennan.

<text>Goodman Ace (January 15, 1899 – March 25, 1982), born Goodman Aiskowitz, was an American humorist, radio writer and comedian, television writer, and magazine columnist.

His low-key, literate drollery and softly tart way of tweaking trends and pretenses made him one of the most sought-after writers in radio and television from the 1930s through the 1960s.

==Early years==
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Latvian Jewish immigrants Harry Aiskowitz, who worked as a haberdasher, and Anna Katzen, Ace grew up wanting to write, and as the editor of his high school newspaper, he took on his first &quot;nom de plume&quot;, Asa Goodman. Ace worked as a roller skating messenger for Montgomery Ward while he studied journalism at Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. He also wrote a weekly column called &quot;The Dyspeptic&quot; for the school&#x27;s newspaper. After working at the post office and a local haberdashery to support his mother and sisters after his father&#x27;s death, he became a reporter and columnist for the Kansas City &quot;Journal-Post&quot;.

Jane Epstein was his high school sweetheart. Jane wanted to attend the sold-out performance of Al Jolson in Kansas City; her boyfriends were unable to get tickets, but Ace had access to the concert via his press pass. The Jolson concert was the couple&#x27;s first date; they married six months later, in 1922.

==Radio aces==
In 1930, Ace took on a second job reading the Sunday comics on radio station KMBC (anticipating the famous newspaper strike stunt, almost two decades later, by legendary New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia) and hosting a Friday night film review and gossip program called &quot;Ace Goes to the Movies&quot;. Ace was not initially a volunteer for the job. An editor at the &quot;Journal-Post&quot; had the idea that having an employee read the newspaper&#x27;s comics on the air for children would increase circulation for the paper. Taking the job meant an extra $10 per week in one&#x27;s paycheck, but none of the newsroom staff was interested. The editor, reasoning that since Ace&#x27;s current assignment was covering local theater he would be the perfect man for the job, insisted he take it. Ace suggested a second radio show, this one dealing with films, thus collecting an additional $10 per week.

But one night the recorded fifteen-minute show scheduled to air after Ace&#x27;s timeslot failed to feed. With an immediate need to fill fifteen minutes&#x27; more airtime and his wife having accompanied him to the station that night, Ace slipped into an impromptu chat about a bridge game the couple played the previous weekend and invited Jane to join the chat which soon enough included discussion of a local murder case in which a wife murdered her husband over an argument about bridge. Loaded with Goodman&#x27;s wry wit and Jane&#x27;s knack for malaprops (&quot;Would you care to shoot a game of bridge, dear?&quot;), the couple&#x27;s surprise improvisation provoked a response enthusiastic enough to convince KMBC to hand them a regular fifteen-minute slot, creating and performing a &quot;domestic comedy&quot; of their own.

At first, the show that became known as &quot;Easy Aces&quot; centered around the couple&#x27;s bridge playing, according to John Dunning in &quot;On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio&quot; (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998): &quot;Ace was not wild about Jane&#x27;s bridge game, on the air or off, and he kept picking at her until she lost her temper and threatened to quit. The show settled into a new niche, a more universally based domestic comedy revolving around Jane&#x27;s improbable situations and her impossible turns of phrase.&quot;

Written by Goodman Ace, who cast himself as a harried real estate salesman and the exasperated but loving husband of the scatterbrained, malaprop-prone Jane (&quot;You&#x27;ve got to take the bitter with the better&quot;; &quot;Time wounds all heels&quot;), &quot;Easy Aces&quot; became a long-running serial comedy (1930–1945) and a low-keyed legend of old-time radio for its literate, unobtrusive, conversational style and the malaprops of the female half of the team. The show was never a rating blockbuster, but according to Dunning it &quot;was always a favorite of Radio Row insiders. Like Fred Allen and Henry Morgan, Ace was considered an intelligent man&#x27;s wit. His show limped along [but] . . . lasted across several formats for more than fifteen years and was one of radio&#x27;s fondest memories.&quot; The radio show was popular enough to get to the big screen; in 1934, the couple signed with Educational Pictures for some two-reel comedies. &quot;Dumb Luck&quot; was released 18 January 1935, with Goodman and Jane playing their radio characters. While writing &quot;Easy Aces&quot;, Ace also wrote for other radio shows, earning $3,000 per week in this way.

During World War II, he participated in the selection of music for the War Department&#x27;s &quot;Hit Kit&quot; songbook series as part of a carefully selected group of writers, composers, and show business personalities known collectively as the &quot;Committee of 25&quot;.

In 1945, Ace signed on as one of the writers of &quot;The Danny Kaye Show&quot;. Previously he and Jane had been part of a series of celebrity guests who filled in for Kaye while he entertained the armed forces troops who were overseas. When Kaye moved his show from New York to Hollywood, Ace resigned. Whether writing for himself and Jane or for another performer, Ace&#x27;s rating system of how well a script would do was based on the number of cigars he smoked while writing it. One cigar meant the show would do very well, while four cigars meant this program or episode was most likely hopeless. Ace was sued in 1940 because of the name he selected for a character. He used the first name of one of his staff coupled with the last name of another. Unknown to Ace, this resulted in the name of a real person who was publicly embarrassed by the use of his name on the show. He then began the practice of having those on the program use their own names for their characters.

In 1948, Ace created a new, half-hour version of the show, &quot;mr. ace and JANE&quot;; this expanded version, perhaps because a live studio audience detracted from its quiet style (a point made especially vivid by its audience-less, quiet audition show, and when new episodes expanded upon some of the old show&#x27;s vintages), didn&#x27;t last beyond a single season. And it fared no better on television. In 1956, both Ace and NBC thought seriously enough about another try for the television series to announce Ernie Kovacs and his wife Edie Adams would play the Aces in a pilot for the show; it is unknown whether the pilot took place.

The husband and wife team returned to network radio with the debut of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot;; the Aces were announced as &quot;Communicators&quot; just after Dave Garroway&#x27;s joining the show. They were also part of NBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Weekday&quot;, which was a Monday through Friday network offering aimed at women that premiered not long after &quot;Monitor&quot;. Ace branched out by writing commercials, featuring himself and Jane. The couple also voiced some commercials used on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Startime&quot;, while other actors played the visual roles.

==&quot;Terrible Vaudeville&quot; and &quot;You Are There&quot;==
Ace needled television in a 1953 letter to Groucho Marx: &quot;...TV—a clever contraction derived from the words Terrible Vaudeville. However, it is our latest medium—we call it a medium because nothing&#x27;s well done.&quot; Nonetheless, he hadn&#x27;t been averse to giving television a try.

Goodman and Jane Ace adapted &quot;Easy Aces&quot; to television in December 1949, with a fifteen-minute filmed version on the DuMont network (also syndicated in some areas through Ziv Television Programs) that ended in mid-June 1950, after airing Wednesday nights from 7:45–8:00 p.m. &quot;As on radio,&quot; authors Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh wrote, &quot;Ace was his witty, intelligent self, and his wife, Jane, was a charming bundle of malapropisms&quot;. The television show included Betty Garde as Jane Ace&#x27;s friend, Dorothy. What it didn&#x27;t include was an audience equal to the ones who kept &quot;Easy Aces&quot; on radio for all those years. The demise of the show also meant the demise of the Aces&#x27; career in front of a microphone or camera. Jane Ace retired almost completely; Goodman retired as a performer, becoming for the most part a writer from 1949 onward.

Ace did have a serious side, too, and he melded it to his sense of the absurd to create a radio show with the twist of taking listeners to re-created historical events described by actual CBS News reporters. The problem, as revealed by CBS historian Robert Metz (in &quot;CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye&quot;), was that Ace didn&#x27;t get official credit for his creation for many years; a CBS executive vice president named Desmond Taylor gained the original credit for the show born on radio as &quot;CBS Was There&quot; and famed (especially on television, with future anchor Walter Cronkite narrating) for its introduction, which leapt into the American vernacular: &quot;All things are as they were then, except you... are... there!&quot;

== &quot;You Gentlemen, The Authors&quot; ==

By this time, however, Ace began writing for other performers, including Milton Berle, Perry Como, Danny Kaye, Robert Q. Lewis, and Bob Newhart. He would be nominated for Emmy Awards twice during his term as Como&#x27;s head writer, in 1956 and 1959. Ace rationalized his work by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not in television. I&#x27;m with Perry Como.&quot; Perhaps his best turn of writing in these years, however, was his collaboration with Frank Wilson on &quot;The Big Show&quot;, considered NBC&#x27;s last-gasp attempt to keep classic radio alive. This 90-minute variety program was hosted by Tallulah Bankhead and featured a rotating cast that included some of America&#x27;s and the world&#x27;s greatest entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Jimmy Durante, Joan Davis, Bob Hope, Louis Armstrong, George Jessel, Ethel Merman, José Ferrer, Ed Wynn, Lauritz Melchior, Ezio Pinza, Édith Piaf, Ginger Rogers, Ethel Barrymore, Phil Silvers, Benny Goodman, and Danny Thomas. The show was marked by Ace&#x27;s wry style, adapted to Bankhead&#x27;s diva-blunt style. Ace said years later that one of his secrets was isolating particular interests of the guests – for example, Ginger Rogers&#x27; passion for playing golf – and writing comic routines around those interests.

Ace fondly remembered working with Bankhead in later years. &quot;&#x27;You gentlemen, the authors,&#x27; she would say&quot;, he once told author Robert Metz, &quot;we gag writers felt pretty good about that.&quot; What he didn&#x27;t necessarily feel good about, as he told radio interviewers Richard Lamparski and John Dunning two decades later, was the writers&#x27; non-mention in Bankhead&#x27;s memoir recollection about &quot;The Big Show&quot;.

Ace had known Jack Benny since his Kansas City years. Radio historian Arthur Frank Wertheim recorded (in &quot;Radio Comedy&quot;) that, as a young newspaper reporter and columnist, Ace had written a witty gossip column that moved Benny himself to ask the young writer for some jokes for his stage act. Benny asked for more and paid Ace $50 for one packet of jokes. &quot;Your jokes got lots of laughs&quot;, said the note Benny sent with the check. &quot;If you have any more, send them along&quot;. According to Wertheim, Ace returned the check with a note: &quot;Your check got lots of laughs. If you have any more, send them along&quot;. He ended up supplying Benny with gags &quot;on the house&quot; for years, Wertheim noted.

Benny was inadvertently responsible for a very funny exchange of letters between Ace and the owner of the Stork Club, Sherman Billingsley. Benny invited Ace to lunch at the Stork; when Ace got to the club, Benny had not yet arrived. The staff at the Stork Club did not recognize Ace and he received a very cool reception. When Benny finally did get to the Stork, he was told Ace didn&#x27;t want to wait and left. Soon Billingsley&#x27;s notes began to arrive in Ace&#x27;s mailbox, inviting him to come to the club for the marvelous air conditioning. Ace wrote back that he was well aware of how cool it was at the Stork, having received the cold shoulder there. Billingsley&#x27;s response was a gift—bow ties for Ace, whose reply was to ask Billingsley for some matching socks so he would be well-dressed when he was refused admittance again.

Ace wrote one screenplay, &quot;I Married a Woman&quot;, in 1957. Calling it the best thing he had ever written, but the worst thing he had ever seen after viewing the film, He never tried his hand at screenwriting again. When the couple&#x27;s Miami hotel room was robbed in 1966, Ace managed to find humor in the situation.

Ace revealed in the mid-1960s that CBS once developed a kind of school for young comedy writers, with Ace himself &quot;placed in charge of a group of six or seven young writers who wanted to make all that easy money&quot;, as he recalled in a later magazine column. All became television writers and two eventually became successful playwrights: George Axelrod (&quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;) and Neil Simon (&quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;).

== The Saturday Reviewer ==
Ace became a regular columnist for &quot;Saturday Review&quot; (formerly &quot;The Saturday Review of Literature&quot;; he liked to suggest cause-and-effect in the magazine&#x27;s name changing two weeks after his debut in its pages) in the early 1950s. At first, he focused—in what a publisher described (considering his parallel employment writing &quot;for&quot; television) as &quot;nibbling the hand that feeds him&quot;—on television criticism in his usual droll style; a collection of this criticism was published in 1955 as &quot;The Book of Little Knowledge: More Than You Want to Know About Television&quot;.

Later, Ace shifted to more broad contemporary concerns and called the column &quot;Top of My Head&quot;; these essays became as well-read as his old radio show had been, without being either too frivolous or too overbearing. Sometimes, they were gentle; sometimes, they were more tart, always they were without genuine malice. Often they included his beloved Jane, and they were strongly enough received to provoke two published collections, &quot;The Fine Art of Hypochondria; or, How Are You?&quot; and &quot;The Better of Goodman Ace.&quot;

As if suggesting that radio had never really left him, Ace assembled and published a collection of eight complete &quot;Easy Aces&quot; scripts, with new essays and comments from the Aces, as &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen – Easy Aces&quot; in 1970. He also held a small regular slot offering witty commentaries on New York station WPAT for a time, before going out over the full National Public Radio network during the 1970s.

Also around that time, two decades after the brief, unsuccessful television adaptation of &quot;Easy Aces&quot;, someone else was willing to give the concept a fresh television try: a number of the original &quot;Easy Aces&quot; radio scripts were adapted for the Canadian CTV Television Network show &quot;The Trouble with Tracy&quot; in 1970. However, though 130 episodes of this series were produced (all in 1970/71), and the show was re-run well into the 1980s on Canadian TV, &quot;The Trouble With Tracy&quot; was regarded as an almost unqualified disaster on a creative level. This had less to do with the scripts, however, and more with the incredible cheapness of the production. Seven episodes were filmed every five days on wobbly sets, with almost no time for rehearsal for either the actors or the technical crew—flubbed lines and bloopers sometimes ended up airing in finished episodes, because the show could not afford retakes. Ultimately, &quot;The Trouble With Tracy&quot; is often cited, especially in Canada, as the worst sitcom ever made. Note, though, that while Ace had a hand in the modern adaptation of the scripts, neither he nor Jane Ace appeared in it, and neither played any part in the actual production of the series.

Jane Ace died after a long illness in 1974, just days before what would have been their fiftieth wedding anniversary. Her husband&#x27;s tribute to her in the 8 February 1975 issue (&quot;Jane&quot;) provoked hundreds of letters from his regular readers and from the couple&#x27;s old radio fans.

&quot;...now alone at a funeral home...the questions...the softly spoken suggestions...repeated, and repeated... because ...because during all the arrangements, through my mind there ran a constant rerun, a line she spoke on radio...on the brotherhood of man ...in her casual, malapropian style ... &quot;we are all cremated equal&quot; ... they kept urging for an answer...a wooden casket? ... a metal casket? ...it&#x27;s the name of their game ... a tisket a casket...and then transporting it to Kansas City, Mo. ...the plane ride...&quot;smoking or non-smoking section?&quot; somebody asked ... the non-thinking section was what I wanted...

&quot;...a soft sprinkle of snow as we huddled around her...the first of the season, they told me ... lasted only through the short service ...snow stopped the instant the last words were spoken. He had the grace to celebrate her arrival with a handful of His confetti ...&quot;

== Death ==
Goodman Ace died eight years after his wife, in their New York City home in March 1982. The couple are interred together in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Raytown: a suburb of their native Kansas City.

&quot;Mr. Ace&quot;, wrote &quot;The New York Times&#x27;s&quot; obituarist, David Bird, &quot;liked to scoff at ratings. He said that neither the writer nor a star alone could make or break a comedy show. It took, he said, a good time spot and teamwork. &#x27;The whole thing has to be a kind of partnership—a marriage between writer and performer,&#x27; he explained, &#x27;If there is no marriage—well you know what the brainchild has to be&#x27;.&quot;

The author of &quot;CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye&quot;, Robert Metz, recalled that, once, a relative of Ace&#x27;s had wired him to say, &quot;Send me $10,000 or I&#x27;ll jump from the fourteenth floor of my building&quot;, and Ace was said to have wired back, &quot;Jump from seven—I&#x27;ll send $5,000.&quot;

When CBS fired Ace as the head of its &quot;comedy workshop&quot; in the late 1940s, according to &quot;Time&quot;, a sympathetic network vice president told him afterward, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you a secret—we haven&#x27;t got a man who understands comedy.&quot; Ace wryly replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you a secret—that&#x27;s no secret.&quot;

Ace offered his own epitaph when &quot;Saturday Review&quot; ran a poll asking well-known Americans to nominate members of a contemporary Hall of Fame. &quot;I respectfully suggest the name of Goodman Ace...if he&#x27;s still around&quot;, Ace replied. &quot;If he isn&#x27;t, I wouldn&#x27;t dig him up just for this.&quot; The National Radio Hall of Fame respectfully ignored that suggestion, inducting &quot;Easy Aces&quot; in 1990.

<text>Hidalgo is a 2004 epic biographical western film based on the legend of the American distance rider Frank Hopkins and his mustang Hidalgo. It recounts Hopkins&#x27; racing his horse in Arabia in 1891 against Bedouins riding pure-blooded Arabian horses. The movie was written by John Fusco and directed by Joe Johnston. It stars Viggo Mortensen, Zuleikha Robinson, and Omar Sharif.

&quot;Hidalgo&quot; was released by Buena Vista Pictures on March 5, 2004. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews and it underperformed at the box office, grossing $108 million against a budget of $100 million.

==Plot==

In 1890, Frank T. Hopkins and his mustang, Hidalgo, are part of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show, advertised as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest endurance horse and rider.&quot; A famous long-distance racer, cowboy, and dispatch rider for the United States government, Hopkins is plagued by guilt for having carried a message to the 7th Cavalry Regiment authorizing the Wounded Knee Massacre of Lakota Sioux. He translates a futile request from another performer, Chief Eagle Horn, for Bill to help his nation’s mustangs that have been rounded up by the government to be eradicated.

Wealthy Sheikh Riyadh sends his attaché Aziz, accompanied by Rau Rasmussen, to challenge Hopkins and Hidalgo to enter the &quot;Ocean of Fire&quot;: an annual 3,000-mile race across the Najd desert region for a $100,000 prize. The Sheikh is custodian of the &quot;al-Khamsa&quot; line, considered the greatest distance horses in the world, and traditionally the race has been restricted to pure-bred Arabian horses and Bedouin or Arab riders. Hopkins’ fellow performers raise his entrance fee, and he encounters unscrupulous English horse breeder Lady Anne Davenport. He meets Sheikh Riyadh, an admirer of the Wild West, who has promised his daughter Jazira as the fifth wife to the prince riding the Sheikh&#x27;s horse Al-Hattal, should he win.
The race begins, and Hopkins and Hidalgo face grueling conditions and contempt for an &quot;infidel&quot; riding an &quot;impure&quot; horse, and survive sabotage and a sandstorm. Determined to live her own life, Jazira advises Hopkins on surviving in the desert, but they are discovered together in his tent. The Sheikh prepares to have Hopkins gelded as punishment, but his outcast nephew Katib raids the camp, seeking control of the al-Khamsa line. The prince flees on Al-Hattal, but Aziz steals the Sheikh’s family journal of horse breeding for Katib, who kidnaps Jazira and demands Al-Hattal as ransom.

Hopkins rescues Jazira, who recovers the journal. Journeying back to camp, Hopkins reveals that his mother was Lakota Sioux, deepening his guilt over his role at Wounded Knee. Jazira compares his relationship to his heritage with her desire to avoid wearing the veil, urging him not to &quot;go through life hiding what God made you.&quot; Davenport bribes Hopkins to drop out of the race, but he declines her offer and her advances toward him. Unbeknownst to him, Davenport is in league with Katib; they plan to kill Hidalgo and steal Al-Hattal, allowing her mare to win the race and breed with the Sheikh’s horse.

Enduring a swarm of locusts, Hopkins remembers Jazira’s advice and he and Hidalgo resort to eating them. Although it is forbidden to help other riders, he saves his opponent Sakr from quicksand. Hopkins is ambushed by Katib and falls into a trap, severely injuring Hidalgo, and is rescued by Sakr. They fight off Katib&#x27;s men, but Sakr is shot, and Hopkins kills Katib in one of his own traps. Hidalgo collapses, and Hopkins considers shooting him in mercy, but a vision of Lakota elders and his mother appears to him as he chants a prayer to &quot;Wakan Tanka.&quot;

The prince arrives and taunts Hopkins that the end of the race is in sight, and Hidalgo suddenly struggles upright. Riding bareback, Hopkins comes from behind to surpass Davenport&#x27;s mare and the prince, winning the race. He befriends the Sheikh, giving him his revolver, and bids farewell to an unveiled Jazira, who calls him by his Lakota name, &quot;Blue Child.&quot; Returning to the United States, Frank uses his winnings to buy the mustangs from the government, releasing them into the wild and freeing Hidalgo to join them. An epilogue reveals that Hopkins went on to reportedly win 400 long-distance races and was an outspoken supporter for wild mustangs until his death in 1951, while Hidalgo&#x27;s descendants live free in the wilderness of Oklahoma.

==Production==
Actor Viggo Mortensen, who is fluent in Spanish, voiced his own character (Frank Hopkins) in the Spanish dubs of the film.

Johnny Depp revealed during a sworn testimony at his defamation trial against Amber Heard that Disney offered him the lead role in Hidalgo, but, after reading the screenplay, he turned it down, saying, &quot;I just didn&#x27;t think it was for me.&quot; Instead, Depp asked Disney for a more family friendly cartoon-like role, and Disney then offered him the role of Jack Sparrow.

==Toys==
Breyer Animal Creations produced a line of model horses inspired by the film.

==Historical accuracy==
The Native American historian Vine Deloria questioned Hopkins&#x27; claims of Lakota ancestry, as presented uncritically in the film.

But, Nakota filmmaker Angelique Midthunder said during the controversy that &quot;the story of the half Indian who took his pinto mustang across the sea to race in the big desert has been told to children of the northern plains tribes for generations.&quot; Lakota elder Sonny Richards writes, &quot;Kaiyuzeya Sunkanyanke (Frank Hopkins) was a South Dakota native and Lakota half-breed.&quot;

Based on Hopkins&#x27; account of his mixed-race ancestry, the movie production employed Lakota historians, medicine men, and tribal leaders as consultants to advise during every scene that represented their culture. Many of the Ghost Dancers who reenact the sacred ceremony of 1890 in &quot;Hidalgo&quot; had participated in the film &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992) and the mini-series &quot;Dreamkeeper&quot;, both written by Fusco. The screenwriter was adopted as an honorary relative of the Oglala Nation in a &quot;Hunkyapi&quot; ceremony (Making of Relatives) on September 3, 1989, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

Because the Disney Corporation marketed the movie as a true story, some historians criticized the film both because of the legendary status of Hopkins&#x27; claims and for the film&#x27;s divergence from his accounts. They contend that many of the events, especially the featured race, never took place. Historians of distance riding said that most of Hopkins&#x27; claims as depicted in the film, including the race, have been &#x27;tall tales&#x27; or hoaxes.

The film says that descendants of the horse Hidalgo, for which the movie was named, live among the Gilbert Jones herd of Spanish Mustangs on Blackjack Mountain in Oklahoma. By Hopkins&#x27; original account, he decided to leave his horse in Arabia after the race.

In 2006, John Fusco, the screenwriter of &quot;Hidalgo&quot;, responded to criticism about the historical basis of the film. He had done research on Hopkins for years. He said that he used parts of Hopkins&#x27; 1891 desert memoirs (unpublished during the rider&#x27;s lifetime) and &quot;heightened the &#x27;Based On&#x27; story to create an entertaining theatrical film.&quot; He held that the story of the man and his horse is true. Fusco offered quotes from surviving friends of Hopkins, notably former distance riders Walt and Edith Pyle, and Lt Col William Zimmerman, along with information found in horse history texts, as verification.

According to the Longriders Guild, the Saudi Arabian Government say officially that there has never been an &quot;Ocean of Fire&quot; race. Hopkins never named the event; he referred to it in his writings as an annual ceremonial ride in the region. According to the Arab historian Dr. Awad al-Badi, such a lengthy race was impossible. He said,

There is no record or reference to Hopkins with or without his mustangs ever having set foot on Arabian soil. The idea of a historic long-distance Arab horse race is pure nonsense and flies against all reason. Such an event in Arabia any time in the past is impossible simply from a technical, logistical, cultural and geopolitical point of view. It has never been part of our rich traditions and equestrian heritage.

==Horses==
Several American Paint horses were used to portray Hidalgo. The actor Viggo Mortensen later bought RH Tecontender, one of the horses used in the film. The screenwriter John Fusco bought Oscar, the main stunt horse, and retired him at Red Road Farm, his American Indian horse conservancy. Another one was bought by a ranch near Toponas, Colorado.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The movie received mixed reviews from mainstream critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 46% with an average rating of 5.5/10, based on reviews from 164 critics. The critical consensus reads, &quot;The scenery looks great, but this overstuffed horse story contains too much cheese&quot;. Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 54/100 based on reviews from 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert offered a positive review of the film (three out of four stars), saying it&#x27;s &quot;Bold, exuberant and swashbuckling,&quot; the kind of fun, rip-snorting adventure film Hollywood rarely makes anymore. He added, &quot;please ignore any tiresome scolds who complain that the movie is not really based on fact. Duh.&quot; Eleanor Ringel Cater of &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; gave the film a B, stating that the film &quot;certainly has its problems, but they&#x27;re outweighed by the simple pleasures of a picture that takes its cue equally from old-fashioned adventures like &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and newfangled ones like &quot;The Mummy&quot;.&quot; Gemma Tarlach of &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; gave it a two-and-a-half out of four rating, calling it &quot;an entertaining but far-short- of-epic popcorn romp that&#x27;s equal parts &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed approximately $18,829,435 on its opening weekend, peaking at #3 behind &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; and &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; in 3,065 theatres. It closed from theatres on July 22, 2004, with $67.3 million in North America, and $40.8 million internationally. The film made a worldwide total of $108.1 million.

==Accolades==

John Fusco won the Spur Award for Best Western Drama Script; although most of the plot of &quot;Hidalgo&quot; was not set in the American West, it featured an American cowboy figure.

<doc id="525298" wikidata="Q1304214" url="?curid=525298" title="Interfaith dialogue">
<text>Interfaith dialogue, also known as interreligious dialogue, refers to cooperative, constructive, and positive interaction between people of different religious traditions (i.e. &quot;faiths&quot;) and/or spiritual or humanistic beliefs, at both the individual and institutional levels.

Throughout the world there are local, regional, national and international interfaith initiatives; many are formally or informally linked and constitute larger networks or federations. The often quoted statement &quot;There will be no peace among the nations without peace among the religions. There will be no peace among the religions without dialogue among the religions&quot; was formulated by Hans Küng, a Professor of Ecumenical Theology and President of the Global Ethic Foundation. Interfaith dialogue forms a major role in the study of religion and peacebuilding.

== Definition ==
The Archdiocese of Chicago&#x27;s Office for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs defines &quot;the difference between ecumenical, interfaith, and interreligious relations&quot;, as follows:

* &quot;ecumenical&quot; as &quot;relations and prayer with other Christians&quot;,
* &quot;interfaith&quot; as &quot;relations with members of the &#x27;Abrahamic faiths&#x27; (Jewish, Muslim and Christian traditions),&quot; and
* &quot;interreligious&quot; as &quot;relations with other religions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism&quot;.

Some interfaith dialogues have more recently adopted the name interbelief dialogue, while other proponents have proposed the term interpath dialogue, to avoid implicitly excluding atheists, agnostics, humanists, and others with no religious faith but with ethical or philosophical beliefs, as well as to be more accurate concerning many world religions that do not place the same emphasis on &quot;faith&quot; as do some Western religions. Similarly, pluralistic rationalist groups have hosted public reasoning dialogues to transcend all worldviews (whether religious, cultural or political), termed transbelief dialogue. To some, the term interreligious dialogue has the same meaning as interfaith dialogue. The World Council of Churches states: &quot;Following the lead of the Roman Catholic Church, other churches and Christian religious organizations, such as the World Council of Churches, have increasingly opted to use the word interreligious rather than interfaith to describe their own bilateral and multilateral dialogue and engagement with other religions. [...] the term interreligious is preferred because we are referring explicitly to dialogue with those professing religions – who identify themselves explicitly with a religious tradition and whose work has a specific religious affiliation and is based on religious foundations.&quot;

==History==




History records examples of interfaith initiatives throughout the ages, with varying levels of success in establishing one of three types of &quot;dialogue&quot; to engender, as recently described, either understanding, teamwork, or tolerance:

# &quot;In the dialogue of the head, we mentally reach out to the other to learn from those who think differently from us.&quot;
# &quot;In the dialogue of the hands, we all work together to make the world a better place in which we must all live together.&quot;
# &quot;In the dialogue of the heart, we share the experience of the emotions of those different from us.&quot;

The historical effectiveness of interfaith dialogue is an issue of debate. Friar James L. Heft, in a lecture on &quot;The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy,&quot; spoke about the conflicts among practitioners of the three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). Noting that except for the Convivencia in the 14th and 15th centuries, believers in these religions have either kept their distance or have been in conflict, Heft maintains, &quot;there has been very little genuine dialogue&quot; between them. &quot;The sad reality has been that most of the time Jews, Muslims and Christians have remained ignorant about each other, or worse, especially in the case of Christians and Muslims, attacked each other.&quot;

In contrast, The Pluralism Project at Harvard University says, &quot;Every religious tradition has grown through the ages in dialogue and historical interaction with others. Christians, Jews, and Muslims have been part of one another&#x27;s histories, have shared not only villages and cities, but ideas of God and divine revelation.&quot;

The importance of Abrahamic interfaith dialogue in the present has been bluntly presented: &quot;We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!&quot;

More broadly, interfaith dialogue and action have occurred over many centuries. In the 16th century, the Emperor Akbar encouraged tolerance in Mughal India, a diverse nation with people of various faith backgrounds, including Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Christianity.

Religious pluralism can also be observed in other historical contexts, including Muslim Spain. Zarmanochegas (Zarmarus) (Ζαρμανοχηγὰς) was a monk of the Sramana tradition (possibly, but not necessarily a Buddhist) from India who journeyed to Antioch and Athens while Augustus (died 14 CE) was ruling the Roman Emprire.

===19th-century initiatives===
The 1893 Parliament of World Religions at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois is &quot;often regarded as the birth of the interfaith movement&quot;. The congress was the first organized, international gathering of religious leaders. Since its first meeting in 1893, there have been eight meetings including one in 2015.

===20th-century initiatives===
In 1900, the International Association for Religious Freedom (IARF) was founded under a name different from its current one. In 1987, its statement of purpose was revised to include advancing &quot;understanding, dialogue and readiness to learn and promotes sympathy and harmony among the different religious traditions&quot;. In 1990, its membership was enlarged &quot;to include all the world&#x27;s major religious groups&quot;. In 1996, IARF&#x27;s World Congress included representatives of Palestinian and Israeli IARF groups and Muslim participants made presentations.

In December 1914, just after World War I began, a group of Christians gathered in Cambridge, England to found the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) &quot;in hopes of bringing people of faith together to promote peace, and it went on to become a leading interfaith voice for non-violence and non-discrimination&quot;. It has branches and affiliated groups in over 50 countries on every continent. The membership includes &quot;Jews, Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, Indigenous religious practitioners, Baháʼí, and people of other faith traditions, as well as those with no formal religious affiliation&quot;.

In 1936, the World Congress of Faiths (WCF) formed in London. It is &quot;one of the oldest interfaith bodies in the world&quot;. One of its purposes is to bring &quot;people of faith together to enrich their understandings of their own and others&#x27; traditions&quot;. It does this by offering opportunities &quot;to meet, explore, challenge and understand different faith traditions through events from small workshops to large conferences, partnership working, online conversation, and publications&quot;.

In 1949, following the devastation of World War II, the Fellowship In Prayer was founded in 1949 by Carl Allison Evans and Kathryn Brown. Evans believed that unified prayer would &quot;bridge theological or structural religious differences&quot;, would &quot;open the mind and heart of the prayer to a new understanding of and appreciation for the beliefs and values of those following different spiritual paths&quot;, and would &quot;advance interfaith understanding and mutual respect among religious traditions&quot;,

In 1952, the International Humanist and Ethical Union (IHEU) was founded in Amsterdam. It serves as &quot;the sole world umbrella organisation embracing Humanist, atheist, rationalist, secularist, skeptic, laique, ethical cultural, freethought and similar organisations world-wide&quot;. IHEU&#x27;s &quot;vision is a Humanist world; a world in which human rights are respected and everyone is able to live a life of dignity&quot;. It implements its vision by seeking &quot;to influence international policy through representation and information, to build the humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism&quot;.

Between 1956 and 1964, the Benedictine monastery of Toumliline hosted conferences called &quot;International Meetings&quot; which hosted Christian, Jewish and Muslim scholars such as Louis Massignon, Emmanuel Levinas and Seyyed Hossein Nasr.

In 1958, the Center for the Study of World Religions (CSWR) at Harvard Divinity School (HDS) began. Since then, it &quot;has been at the forefront of promoting the sympathetic study and understanding of world religions. It has supported academic inquiry and international understanding in this field through its residential community,&quot; and &quot;its research efforts and funding, and its public programs and publications&quot;.

In 1960, Juliet Hollister (1916–2000) created the Temple of Understanding (TOU) to provide &quot;interfaith education&quot; with the purpose of &quot;breaking down prejudicial boundaries&quot;. The Temple of Understanding &quot;over several years hosted meetings that paved the way for the North American Interfaith Network (NAIN)&quot;.

In the late 1960s, interfaith groups such as the Clergy And Laity Concerned (CALC) joined around Civil Rights issues for African-Americans and later were often vocal in their opposition to the Vietnam War.

In 1965, &quot;about 100 Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergy&quot; formed Clergy Concerned about Vietnam (CCAV). Its purpose was &quot;to challenge U.S. policy on Vietnam&quot;. When the group admitted laity, it renamed itself National Emergency Committee of Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam (CALCAV) In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. used its platform for his &quot;Beyond Vietnam&quot; speech. Later, CALCAV addressed other issues of social justice issues and changed its name to become simply Clergy and Laymen Concerned (CALC).

In 1965, during Vatican II, it was decided that relations with all religions should be developed. To do this, Pope Paul VI established a special secretariat (later a pontifical council) for relationships with non-Christians. The papal encyclical &quot;Ecclesiam Suam &quot; emphasized the importance of positive encounter between Christians and people of other faith traditions. &quot;The Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions&quot; (&quot;Nostra Aetate&quot;) of 1965, spelled out the pastoral dimensions of this relationship.

In 1967, the World Council of Churches conference &quot;proved to be a landmark both as the beginning of serious interest in interfaith dialogue as such in the WCC, and as the first involvement in the ecumenical discussion of the Vatican Secretariat for Non-Christians&quot;.

In 1970, the first World Conference of Religions for Peace was held in Kyoto, Japan. Religions for Peace is &quot;the world&#x27;s largest and most representative multi-religious coalition advancing common action for peace&quot;. Its work includes &quot;dialogue&quot; that &quot;bears fruit in common concrete action&quot;. Through the organization, diverse religious communities discern &quot;deeply held and widely shared&quot; moral concerns, such as, &quot;transforming violent conflict, promoting just and harmonious societies, advancing human development and protecting the earth&quot;.

In 1977, the Dialogue Interreligieux Monastique - Monastic Interreligious Dialogue (DIMMID) is created in Peterborough, Massachusetts and Loppem, Belgium. The aim of this Benedictine and Cistercian organisation is to foster religious dialogue with other monastic communities across all religions.

In 1978, the Interfaith Conference of Metropolitan Washington (IFC) was formed. &quot;The IFC brings together eleven historic faith communities to promote dialogue, understanding and a sense of community and to work cooperatively for justice throughout the District of Columbia region.&quot; Members include the Baháʼí Faith, Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Jain, Jewish, Latter-day Saints, Protestant, Roman Catholic, Sikh and Zoroastrian faith communities.

In 1981, Minhaj-ul-Quran was founded. It is &quot;a Pakistan-based international organization working to promote peace, tolerance, interfaith harmony and education, tackle extremism and terrorism, engage with young Muslims for religious moderation, promote women&#x27;s rights, development and empowerment, and provide social welfare and promotion of human rights&quot;. 

On October 27, 1986 Pope John Paul II had a day of prayer at Assisi and invited &quot;about fifty Christians and fifty leaders of other faiths&quot;. In his book &quot;One Christ–Many Religions&quot;, S. J. Samartha says that the importance of that day of prayer for &quot;interreligious relationships cannot be overestimated&quot; and gives &quot;several reasons&quot; for its importance:
# &quot;It conferred &quot;legitimacy&quot; to Christian initiatives in interreligious dialogues.&quot;
# &quot;It was seen as an event of &quot;theological&quot; significance.&quot;
# &quot;Assisi was recognized as &quot;an act of dialogue&quot; in the highest degree.&quot;
# &quot;It emphasized the &quot;religious&quot; nature of peace.&quot;
However, Samartha added, two points caused &quot;disquiet&quot; to people of faiths other than Christian:
# The Pope&#x27;s insistence on Christ as the &quot;only&quot; source of peace.
# For the prayers Christians were taken to one place and people of other faiths to another place.
Besides, the disquiet caused by the Pope&#x27;s day of prayer, there is an ongoing &quot;suspicion&quot; by &quot;neighbors of other faiths&quot; that &quot;dialogues may be used for purposes of Christian mission&quot;.

In 1991, Harvard University&#x27;s Diana L. Eck launched the Pluralism Project by teaching a course on &quot;World Religions in New England,&quot; in which students explored the &quot;diverse religious communities in the Boston area&quot;. This project was expanded to charting &quot;the development of interfaith efforts throughout the United States&quot; and then the world. The Pluralism Project posts the information on the Pluralism Project website. 

In 1993, on the centennial of its first conference, the Council for a Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions hosted a conference in Chicago with 8,000 participants from faith backgrounds around the world. &quot;The Parliament is the oldest, the largest, and the most inclusive gathering of people of all faith and traditions.&quot; The organization hosts meetings around the world every few years. Its 2015 conference decided to hold meetings every two years. 

In 1994, the Interfaith Alliance was created &quot;to celebrate religious freedom and to challenge the bigotry and hatred arising from religious and political extremism infiltrating American politics&quot;. As of 2016, the Interfaith Alliance has 185,000 members across the country made up of 75 faith traditions as well as those of no faith tradition. The Interfaith Alliance works to (1) &quot;respect the inherent rights of all individuals–as well as their differences&quot;, (2) &quot;promote policies that protect vital boundaries between religion and government&quot;, and (3) &quot;unite diverse voices to challenge extremism and build common ground&quot;.

In 1995, the Interfaith Center at the Presidio was founded with &quot;a multi-faith Board&quot;. The center is a San Francisco Bay Area &quot;interfaith friendship-building&quot; that welcomes &quot;people of all faiths&quot;. The center is committed to &quot;healing and peacemaking within, between, and among religious and spiritual traditions&quot;. 

In 1996, the Center for Interfaith Relations in Louisville, Kentucky established the Festival of Faiths, a multi-day event that promotes interfaith understanding, cooperation and action.

In 1996, Kim Bobo founded the Interfaith Worker Justice (IWJ) organization. Today IWJ includes a national network of more than 70 local interfaith groups, worker centers and student groups, making it the leading national organization working to strengthen the religious community&#x27;s involvement in issues of workplace justice.

In 1997, the Interfaith Center of New York (ICNY) was founded by the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, former Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. ICNY&#x27;s historic partners have included the New York State Unified Court System, Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, UJA-Federation of New York, the Center for Court Innovation, the Harlem Community Justice Center, CONNECT and the city&#x27;s nine Social Work Schools. ICNY works with hundreds of grassroots and immigrant religious leaders from fifteen different faith and ethnic traditions. Its &quot;long-term goal is to help New York City become a nationally and internationally recognized model for mutual understanding and cooperation among faith traditions&quot;.

In 1998, the Muslim Christian Dialogue Forum was formed &quot;to promote religious tolerance between Muslims and Christians so that they could work for the promotion of peace, human rights, and democracy&quot;. On December 8, 2015, the Forum sponsored a seminar on the subject of &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; at the Forman Christian College. The purpose was to bring the Muslim and Christian communities together to defeat &quot;terrorism and extremism&quot;.

In 1998 the Forum on Religion and Ecology was founded at a conference at the United Nations. The Forum arose from 10 conferences at the Harvard Center for the Study of World Religions on World Religions and Ecology from 1996 to 1998. The Forum has continued the interreligious dialogue of the role of religions in retrieving, reevaluating, and reconstructing their traditions to meet the growing environmental and social challenges of our time. Through conferences, publications, and educational materials the Forum promotes cooperation in and among the world&#x27;s religions for a flourishing Earth community. Its website includes sections on all world&#x27;s religions, highlight engaged grassroots project and ecojustice work.

In 1998, Interfaith Power &amp; Light (IPL) began as a project of the Episcopal Church&#x27;s Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, California. Building on its initial success, the IPL model has &quot;been adopted by 40 state affiliates&quot;, and IPL is &quot;working to establish Interfaith Power &amp; Light programs in every state&quot;. Ecological sustainability is central to IPL&#x27;s &quot;faith-based activism&quot;. The organization&#x27;s work is reported in its Fact Sheet and 1915 Annual Report.

In 1999, The Rumi Forum (RF) was founded by the Turkish Hizmet [Service to Humanity] Movement. RF&#x27;s mission is &quot;to foster intercultural dialogue, stimulate thinking and exchange of opinions on supporting and fostering democracy and peace and to provide a common platform for education and information exchange&quot;. In particular, the Forum is interested in &quot;pluralism, peace building and conflict resolution, intercultural and interfaith dialogue, social harmony and justice, civil rights and community cohesion&quot;.

===21st-century initiatives===
In 2000, the United Religions Initiative (URI) was founded &quot;to promote enduring, daily interfaith cooperation, to end religiously motivated violence and to create cultures of peace, justice and healing for the Earth and all living beings&quot;. It now claims &quot;more than 790 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles, to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women&#x27;s and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights&quot;.

In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, &quot;interfaith relations proliferated&quot;. &quot;Conversations about the urgency of interfaith dialogue and the need to be knowledgeable about the faith of others gained traction in new ways.&quot;

In 2001, the Children of Abraham Institute (&quot;CHAI&quot;) was founded &quot;to articulate the &#x27;hermeneutics of peace&#x27; ... that might be applied to bringing Jewish, Muslim, and Christian religious, social, and political leaders into shared study not only of the texts of Scripture but also of the paths and actions of peace that those texts demand&quot;.

In 2001, the Interfaith Encounter Association (IEA) was established in Israel. Its impetus dates from the late 1950s in Israel when a group of visionaries (which included Martin Buber) recognised the need for interfaith dialogue. IEA is dedicated to promoting &quot;coexistence in the Middle East through cross-cultural study and inter-religious dialogue&quot;. It forms and maintains &quot;on-going interfaith encounter groups, or centers, that bring together neighboring communities across the country. Each center is led by an interfaith coordinating team with one person for each community in the area.&quot;

In 2002 the Messiah Foundation International was formed as &quot;an interfaith, non-religious, spiritual organisation&quot;. The organisation comprises &quot;people belonging to various religions and faiths&quot; who &quot;strive to bring about widespread divine love and global peace&quot;.

In 2002, the World Council of Religious Leaders (WCRL) was launched in Bangkok. It is &quot;an independent body&quot; that brings religious resources to support the work of the United Nations and its agencies around the world, nation states and other international organizations, in the &quot;quest for peace&quot;. It offers &quot;the collective wisdom and resources of the faith traditions toward the resolution of critical global problems&quot;. The WCRL is not a part of the United Nations.

In 2002, Eboo Patel, a Muslim, started the Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC) with a Jewish friend and an evangelical Christian staff worker. The IFYC was started to bring students of different religions &quot;together not just to talk, but to work together to feed the hungry, tutor children or build housing&quot;. The IFYC builds religious pluralism by &quot;respect for people&#x27;s diverse religious and non-religious identities&quot; and &quot;common action for the common good&quot;.

In 2003, the Jordanian Interfaith Coexistence Research Center (JICRC) was founded by The Very Reverend Father Nabil Haddad. It &quot;focuses on grassroots interfaith dialogue and coexistence&quot;. JICRC provides &quot;advice to government and non-government organizations and individual decision makers regarding questions of inter-religious understanding&quot; and &quot;participates in interfaith efforts on the local, regional, and international levels&quot;.

In 2006, the Coexist Foundation was established. Its mission is &quot;to advance social cohesion through education and innovation&quot; and &quot;to strengthen the bond that holds a society together through a sustainable model of people working and learning together&quot; in order to reduce &quot;prejudice, hate and violence&quot;.

In 2007, the Greater Kansas City Festival of Faiths put on its first festival. The festival&#x27;s goals include: increased participation in interfaith experience and fostering dialogue. Festivals include dramatic events and speakers to &quot;expand interaction and appreciation for different worldviews and religious traditions&quot; One-third of the attendees are &#x27;first-timers&#x27; to any interfaith activity.

On October 13, 2007, Muslims expanded their message. In &quot;A Common Word Between Us and You&quot;, 138 Muslim scholars, clerics and intellectuals unanimously came together for the first time since the days of the Prophet[s] to declare the common ground between Christianity and Islam.

In 2007, the biennial interfaith Insight Film Festival began. It encourages &quot;filmmakers throughout the world to make films about &#x27;faith&#x27;&quot;. The Festival invites &quot;participants from all faith backgrounds&quot; as a way contributing &quot;to understanding, respect and community cohesion&quot;.

In 2008, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin established the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC). The center was founded to &quot;begin a theological dialogue&quot; between Jews and Christians with the belief that in dialogue the two faiths will &quot;find far more which unites&quot; them than divides them. The center, currently located at the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem, engages in Hebraic Bible Study for Christians, from both the local community and from abroad, has organized numerous interfaith praise initiatives, such as &quot;Day to Praise&quot;, and has established many fund-raising initiatives such as &quot;Blessing Bethlehem&quot; which aim to aid the persecuted Christian community of Bethlehem, in part, and the larger persecuted Christian community of the Middle East region and throughout the world.

In 2008, through the collaboration of the Hebrew Union College, Omar Ibn Al-Khattab Foundation, and the University of Southern California, the Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement was created. The center was &quot;inspired by USC President Steven B. Sample&#x27;s vision of increasing collaboration between neighboring institutions in order to benefit both the university and the surrounding community&quot;. Its mission is &quot;to promote dialogue, understanding and grassroots, congregational and academic partnerships among the oldest and the newest of the Abrahamic faiths while generating a contemporary understanding in this understudied area and creating new tools for interfaith communities locally, nationally and beyond.&quot;

In July 2008, a historic interfaith dialogue conference was initiated by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia to solve world problems through concord instead of conflict. The conference was attended by religious leaders of different faiths such as Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism and was hosted by King Juan Carlos of Spain in Madrid.

In January 2009, at Gujarat&#x27;s Mahuva, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an interfaith &quot;World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony&quot; conference convened by Hindu preacher Morari Bapu from January 6 to 11, 2009. This conference explored ways and means to deal with the discord among major religions, according to Morari Bapu. Participants included Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche on Buddhism, Diwan Saiyad Zainul Abedin Ali Sahib (Ajmer Sharif) on Islam, Dr. Prabalkant Dutt on non-Catholic Christianity, Swami Jayendra Saraswathi on Hinduism and Dastur Dr. Peshtan Hormazadiar Mirza on Zoroastrianism.

The Centre &quot;models dialogical, constructive, and innovative research, learning and social engagement&quot;. The centre operates under the leadership of Principal and Dean, Dr. Wendy Fletcher, and Director, Rabbi Dr. Robert Daum.

In 2009, the Charter for Compassion was unveiled to the world. The Charter was inspired by Karen Armstrong when she received the 2008 TED Prize. She made a wish that the TED community would &quot;help create, launch, and propagate a Charter for Compassion&quot;. After the contribution of thousands of people the Charter was compiled and presented. Charter for Compassion International serves as &quot;an umbrella for people to engage in collaborative partnerships worldwide&quot; by &quot;concrete, practical actions&quot;.

In 2009, Council of Interfaith Communities (CIC) was incorporated in Washington, District of Columbia. It mission was &quot;to be the administrative and ecclesiastical home for independent interfaith/multifaith churches, congregations and seminaries in the USA&quot; and to honor &quot;Interfaith as a spiritual expression&quot;. The CIC is one component of the World Council of Interfaith Communities.

In 2009, Project Aladdin, an initiative of cultural diplomacy and interreligious dialogue was founded in Paris. It was initiated by the Fondation pour la Mémoire de la Shoah and sponsored by former French president Jacques Chirac and Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan. Its initial purpose was to counter Holocaust denial in the Muslim world by translating and publishing important Shoah scholarship in Arabic. It has since expanded its mission to combat intolerance, racism, and hate speech against minorities in general.

In 2010, Interfaith Partners of South Carolina was formed. It was the first South Carolina statewide diversity interfaith organization.

In 2010, Project Interfaith began its work. 35 volunteers began recording interviews with people in Omaha, Nebraska. Working in pairs, the volunteers were paired up and given a Flip Video camera to record the interviews. The interviewees were asked three questions: (1) &quot;How do you identify yourself spiritually and why?,&quot; (2) &quot;What is a stereotype that impacts you based on your religious and spiritual identity?,&quot; and (3) &quot;How welcoming do you find our community for your religious or spiritual path?&quot; The recorded interviews were posted on social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. Project Interfaith terminated in 2015.

In 2010, the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development (ICSD) was established. ICSD is the largest interfaith environmental organization in the Middle East. Its work is bringing together &quot;faith groups, religious leaders, and teachers to promote peace and sustainability&quot;.

In 2011, President Obama issued the Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge by sending a letter to all presidents of institutions of higher education in the United States. The goals of the Challenge included maximizing &quot;the education contributions of community-based organizations, including faith and interfaith organizations&quot;. By 2015, more than 400 institutions of higher education had responded to the Challenge. In the 2015 Annual President&#x27;s Interfaith and Community Service Campus Challenge Gathering, international participants were hosted for the first time.

In 2012, the King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz International Centre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue (KAICIID) opened in Vienna, Austria. The board of directors included Jews, Christians, and Muslims. A rabbi on the board said that &quot;the prime purpose is to empower the active work of those in the field, whether in the field of dialogue, of social activism or of conflict resolution&quot;. A Muslim member of the board said that &quot;the aim is to promote acceptance of other cultures, moderation and tolerance&quot;. According to KAICIID officials, &quot;the center is independent and would not be promoting any one religion&quot;.

In February 2016, the International Partnership on Religion and Sustainable Development (PaRD) was launched at the &#x27;Partners for Change&#x27; conference in Berlin. The network connects government bodies, faith-based organisations and civil-society agencies from around the world to encourage communication on religion and sustainable development.

In 2016, the National Catholic Muslim Dialogue (NCMD) was established in the United States. This is a joint venture between the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), the Islamic Society of North America, the Islamic Circle of North America, Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, and the Islamic Educational Center of Orange County. The NCMD was an outgrowth of longstanding regional dialogues in the United States co-sponsored by the USCCB and their regional partners.

In February 2017, Sister Lucy Kurien, founder of Maher NGO, founded the &quot;Interfaith Association for Service to Humanity and Nature&quot; in Pune, India. She defines interfaith spirituality as, &quot;We respect and love all religions. We never put down anyone&#x27;s religion, or uphold one religion to the exclusion of others. What we want is to believe and respect interfaith religion, inclusive of all faith traditions. In our community spiritual practices, we invoke our prayers to the Divine, rather than invoking any particular name or form of God to the exclusion of others.&quot; As of October 2017, this new community has 198 members from 8 countries.

In 2023, The Abrahamic Family House of Worship, an interfaith complex in Abu Dhabi, inspired by the Document on Human Fraternity signed by Pope Francis and Ahmed El-Tayeb in 2019 was completed. It consists of three separate structures: St. Francis of Assisi Church, Imam Al-Tayeb Mosque, and Moses Ben Maimon Synagogue. The project was announced in 2019 and inaugurated in 2023. The complex serves as a community for inter-religious dialogue and exchange, as well as a physical manifestation of the Document on Human Fraternity. The design was prepared by Adjaye Associates, headed by David Adjaye. The three houses of worship have been named after the Grand Imam of Al Azhar, St. Francis of Assisi, and Moses Ben Maimon. The purpose is to represent interfaith co-existence, preserve the unique character of the religions represented, and build bridges between human civilization and the Abrahamic messages.

The United States Institute of Peace published works on interfaith dialogue and peacebuilding including a Special Report on Evaluating Interfaith Dialogue

===Religious intolerance persists===
The above section recounts a &quot;long history of interfaith dialogue&quot;. However, a 2014 article in&quot; The Huffington Post&quot; stated &quot;religious intolerance is still a concern that threatens to undermine the hard work of devoted activists over the decades&quot;. Nevertheless, the article expressed hope that continuing &quot;interfaith dialogue can change this&quot;.

==Policies of religions==
A PhD thesis &quot;Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims&quot; argues that &quot;the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive&quot;. As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done.

===Baháʼí Faith===
Interfaith and multi-faith interactivity is integral to the teachings of the Baháʼí Faith. Its founder Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh enjoined his followers to &quot;consort with the followers of all religions in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship&quot;. Baháʼís are often at the forefront of local inter-faith activities and efforts. Through the Baháʼí International Community agency, the Baháʼís also participate at a global level in inter-religious dialogue both through and outside of the United Nations processes.

In 2002 the Universal House of Justice, the global governing body of the Baháʼís, issued a letter to the religious leadership of all faiths in which it identified religious prejudice as one of the last remaining &quot;isms&quot; to be overcome, enjoining such leaders to unite in an effort to root out extreme and divisive religious intolerance.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism has historically been open to other religions. Ven. Dr. K. Sri Dhammananda stated:

The fourteenth century Zen master Gasan Joseki indicated that the Gospels were written by an enlightened being:

:&quot;And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these... Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself.&quot;

:Gasan said: &quot;Whoever uttered those words I consider an enlightened man.&quot;

The 14th Dalai Lama has done a great deal of interfaith work throughout his life. He believes that the &quot;common aim of all religions, an aim that everyone must try to find, is to foster tolerance, altruism and love&quot;. He met with Pope Paul VI at the Vatican in 1973. He met with Pope John Paul II in 1980 and also later in 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. During 1990, he met in Dharamsala with a delegation of Jewish teachers for an extensive interfaith dialogue. He has since visited Israel three times and met during 2006 with the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met privately with Pope Benedict XVI. He has also met the late Archbishop of Canterbury Dr. Robert Runcie, and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, Gordon B. Hinckley, late President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), as well as senior Eastern Orthodox Church, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, and Sikh officials.

In 2010, the Dalai Lama was joined by Rev. Katharine Jefferts Schori, presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church, Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth, and Islamic scholar Professor Seyyed Hossein Nasr of George Washington University when Emory University&#x27;s Center for the Study of Law and Religion hosted a &quot;Summit on Happiness&quot;.

===Christianity===
In 2013, Pope Francis became the first Catholic leader to call for &quot;sincere and rigorous&quot; interbelief dialogue with atheists, both to counter the assertion that Christianity is necessarily an &quot;expression of darkness of superstition that is opposed to the light of reason&quot;, and to assert that &quot;dialogue is not a secondary accessory of the existence of the believer&quot; but instead is a &quot;profound and indispensable expression ... [of] faith [that] is not intransigent, but grows in coexistence that respects the other.&quot;

===Judaism===
The Modern Orthodox movement allows narrow exchanges on social issues, while warning to be cautious in discussion of doctrine.

Reform Judaism, Reconstructionist Judaism and Conservative Judaism encourage interfaith dialogue.

Building positive relations between Jews and members of other religious communities has been an integral component of Reform Judaism&#x27;s &quot;DNA&quot; since the movement was founded in Germany during the early 19th century, according to Rabbi A. James Rudin. It began with Israel Jacobson, a layman and pioneer in the development of what emerged as Reform Judaism, who established an innovative religious school in Sessen, Germany in 1801 that initially had 40 Jewish and 20 Christian students. &quot;Jacobson&#x27;s innovation of a &#x27;mixed&#x27; student body reflected his hopes for a radiant future between Jews and Christians.&quot;
Moravian born Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who founded the Reform movement in the United States, sought close relations with Christian church leaders. To that end, he published a series of lectures in 1883 entitled &quot;Judaism and Christianity: Their Agreements and Disagreements&quot;. Wise emphasized what he believed linked the two religions in an inextricable theological and human bond: the biblical &quot;Sinaitic revelation&quot; as &quot;... the acknowledged law of God&quot;. Rabbi Leo Baeck, the leader of the German Jewish community who survived his incarceration in the Terezin concentration camp, offered these words in his 1949 presidential address to the World Union for Progressive Judaism in London: &quot;...as in a great period of the Middle Ages, [Jews and Muslims] are ...almost compelled to face each other... not only in the sphere of policy [the State of Israel in the Middle East], but also in the sphere of religion; there is the great hope... they will ...meet each other on joint roads, in joint tasks, in joint confidences in the future. There is the great hope that Judaism can thus become the builder of a bridge, the &#x27;pontifex&#x27; between East and West.&quot;

In the 1950s and 60s, as interfaith civic partnerships between Jews and Christians in the United States became more numerous, especially in the suburbs, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism, URJ) created a department mainly to promote positive Christian-Jewish relations and civic partnerships. Interfaith relations have since been expanded to include Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, and members of other faith communities.

In 2013, Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali coauthored a book &quot;Sons of Abraham: A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims&quot;.
Schneier and Ali write about the importance of civil interfaith discussions. Based on their experience, Schneier and Ali believe that other &quot;Jews and Muslims can realize that they are actually more united than divided in their core beliefs&quot;.

Interests in interfaith relations require an awareness of the range of Jewish views on such subjects as mission and the holy land.

===Islam===
Islam has long encouraged dialogue to reach truth. Dialogue is particularly encouraged amongst the People of the Book (Jews, Christians and Muslims) as the Quran states, &quot;Say, &quot;O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you – that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah.&quot; But if they turn away, then say, &quot;Bear witness that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]&quot; [3:64].

Many traditional and religious texts and customs of the faith have encouraged this, including specific verses in the Quran, such as: &quot;O people! Behold, we have created you from a male and a female and have made you into nations and tribes so that you might come to know one another. Verily, the noblest of you in the sight of God is the one who is most deeply conscious of Him. Behold, God is all-knowing, all-aware&quot; [Qur&#x27;an 49:13].

In recent times, Muslim theologians have advocated inter-faith dialogue on a large scale, something which is new in a political sense. The declaration A Common Word of 2007 was a public first in Christian-Islam relations, trying to work out a moral common ground on many social issues. This common ground was stated as &quot;part of the very foundational principles of both faiths: love of the One God, and love of the neighbour&quot;. The declaration asserted that &quot;these principles are found over and over again in the sacred texts of Islam and Christianity&quot;.

====Interfaith dialogue integral to Islam====
A 2003 book called &quot;Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism&quot; contains a chapter by Amir Hussain on &quot;Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue&quot; in which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. Hussain writes that &quot;Islam would not have developed if it had not been for interfaith dialogue&quot;. From his &quot;first revelation&quot; for the rest of his life, Muhammad was &quot;engaged in interfaith dialogue&quot; and &quot;pluralism and interfaith dialogue&quot; have always been important to Islam. For example, when some of Muhammad&#x27;s followers suffered &quot;physical persecution&quot; in Mecca, he sent them to Abyssinia, a Christian nation, where they were &quot;welcomed and accepted&quot; by the Christian king. Another example is Córdoba, Andalusia in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was &quot;one of the most important cities in the history of the world&quot;. In it, &quot;Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city&quot;. Thus, there is &quot;a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society&quot;. Turning to the present, Hussain writes that in spite of Islam&#x27;s history of &quot;pluralism and interfaith dialogue&quot;, Muslims now face the challenge of conflicting passages in the Qur&#x27;an some of which support interfaith &quot;bridge-building&quot;, but others can be used &quot;justify mutual exclusion&quot;.

In October 2010, as a representative of Shia Islam, Ayatollah Mostafa Mohaghegh Damad, professor at the Shahid Beheshti University of Tehran, addressed the Special Assembly for the Middle East of the Synod of Catholic Bishops. In the address he spoke about &quot;the rapport between Islam and Christianity&quot; that has existed throughout the history of Islam as one of &quot;friendship, respect and mutual understanding&quot;.

====Book about Jewish–Muslim dialogue====
In 2013, Rabbi Marc Schneier (Jewish) and Imam Shamsi Ali (Muslim) coauthored a book &quot;Sons of Abraham&quot; with the subtitle &quot;A Candid Conversation about the Issues That Divide and Unite Jews and Muslims&quot;. As Rabbi Marc Schneier and Imam Shamsi Ali show, &quot;by reaching a fuller understanding of one another&#x27;s faith traditions, Jews and Muslims can realize that they are actually more united than divided in their core beliefs&quot;. By their fuller understanding, they became &quot;defenders of each other&#x27;s religion, denouncing the twin threats of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and promoting interfaith cooperation&quot;. In the book, regarding the state of Jewish-Muslim dialogue, although Rabbi Schneier acknowledges a &quot;tremendous growth&quot;, he does not think that &quot;we are where we want to be&quot;.

====Ahmadiyya====
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community was founded in 1889. Its members &quot;exceeding tens of millions&quot; live in 206 countries. It rejects &quot;terrorism in any form&quot;. It broadcasts its &quot;message of peace and tolerance&quot; over a satellite television channel MTA International Live Streaming, on its internet website, and by its Islam International Publications. A 2010 story in the BBC News said that the Ahmadi &quot;is regarded by orthodox Muslims as heretical&quot;, The story also reported persecution and violent attacks against the Ahmadi.

According to the Ahmadiyya understanding, interfaith dialogues are an integral part of developing inter-religious peace and the establishment of peace. The Ahmadiyya Community has been organising interfaith events locally and nationally in various parts of the world in order to develop a better atmosphere of love and understanding between faiths. Various speakers are invited to deliver a talk on how peace can be established from their own or religious perspectives.

==Preconditions==
In her 2008 book &quot;The Im-Possibility of Interreligious Dialogue&quot;, Catherine Cornille outlines her preconditions for &quot;constructive and enriching dialogue between religions&quot;. In summary, they include &quot;doctrinal humility, commitment to a particular religion, interconnection, empathy, and hospitality&quot;. In full, they include the following:

* humility (causes a respect of a person&#x27;s view of other religions)
* commitment (causes a commitment to faith that simultaneously accept tolerance to other faiths)
* interconnection (causes the recognition of shared common challenges such as the reconciliation of families)
* empathy (causes someone to view another religion from the perspective of its believers)
* hospitability (like the tent of Abraham, that was open on all four sides as a sign of hospitality to any newcomer).

Breaking down the walls that divides faiths while respecting the uniqueness of each tradition requires the courageous embrace of all these preconditions.

In 2016, President Obama made two speeches that outlined preconditions for meaningful interfaith dialogue: On February 3, 2016, he spoke at the Islamic Society of Baltimore and on February 4, 2016, at the National Prayer Breakfast. The eight principles of interfaith relations as outlined by Obama were as follows:

#Relationship building requires visiting each other.
#Relationship requires learning about the others&#x27; history.
#Relationship requires an appreciation of the other.
#Relationship requires telling the truth.
#Relationships depend on living up to our core theological principles and values.
#Relationships offer a clear-headed understanding of our enemies.
#Relationships help us overcome fear.
#Relationship requires solidarity.

==United Nations support==
The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations is an initiative to prevent violence and support social cohesion by promoting intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The UNAOC was proposed by the President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2005. It was co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

In 2008, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury said: &quot;Interfaith dialogue is absolutely essential, relevant, and necessary. ... If 2009 is to truly be the Year of Interfaith Cooperation, the U.N. urgently needs to appoint an interfaith representative at a senior level in the Secretariat.&quot;

The Republic of the Philippines will host a Special Non-Aligned Movement Ministerial Meeting on Interfaith Dialogue and Cooperation for Peace and Development from March 16 to 18 in Manila. During the meeting, to be attended by ministers of foreign affairs of the NAM member countries, a declaration in support of interfaith dialogue initiatives will be adopted. An accompanying event will involve civil society activities.

In 2010, HM King Abdullah II addressed the 65th UN General Assembly and proposed the idea for a &#x27;World Interfaith Harmony Week&#x27; to further broaden his goals of faith-driven world harmony by extending his call beyond the Muslim and Christian community to include people of all beliefs, those with no set religious beliefs as well. A few weeks later, HRH Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad presented the proposal to the UN General Assembly, where it was adopted unanimously as a UN Observance Event. The first week of February, every year, has been declared a UN World Interfaith Harmony Week. The Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre released a document which summarises the key events leading up to the UN resolution as well as documenting some Letters of Support and Events held in honour of the week.

== Research on interfaith dialogue ==

In the emerging field of Interreligious studies, historians, sociologists, and other scholars have conducted research on interfaith dialogue activities, methods, and outcomes. Notably, in 2013, there were several academic initiatives, including the founding of the Interfaith and Interreligious Studies Group at the American Academy of Religion, Office of Religion and Global Affairs at the United States Department of State, and a call for an interfaith studies field was published by Eboo Patel, founder of Interfaith Youth Core, who subsequently helped the funding of academic programs at U.S. universities. Academic journals were started, including the &quot;Journal of Interreligious Studies&quot; and &quot;Interreligious Studies and Intercultural Theology&quot;.[&quot;&quot;]

==Criticism==
Religious sociologist Peter L. Berger argued that one can reject interfaith dialogue on moral grounds in certain cases. The example he gave was that of a dialogue with imams who legitimate ISIS, saying such discussions ought to be avoided so as not to legitimate a morally repugnant theology.

The theological foundations of interreligious dialogue have also been critiqued on the grounds that any interpretation of another faith tradition will be predicated on a particular cultural, historical and anthropological perspective

===Criticism by specific religious groups===

Many Traditionalist Catholics, including Sedevacantists or the Society of St. Pius X, are critical of interfaith dialogue as a harmful novelty. They argue that the Second Vatican Council altered the previous notion of the Catholic Church&#x27;s supremacy over other religious groups or bodies, as well as demoted traditionalist practices associated with Roman Catholicism. In addition, these Catholics contend that, for the sake of collegial peace, tolerance and mutual understanding, interreligious dialogue devalues the divinity of Jesus Christ and the revelation of the Triune God by placing Christianity on the same footing as other religions that worship other deities. Some Evangelical Christians also are critical of dialogues with Catholics.

In the case of Hinduism, it has been argued that interfaith &quot;dialogue ... has [in fact] become the harbinger of violence. This is not because &#x27;outsiders&#x27; have studied Hinduism or because the Hindu participants are religious &#x27;fundamentalists&#x27; but because of the logical requirements of such a dialogue&quot;. With a detailed analysis of &quot;two examples from Hinduism studies&quot;, S.N. Balagangadhara and Sarah Claerhout argue that, &quot;in certain dialogical situations, the requirements of reason conflict with the requirements of morality&quot;.

The Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir rejects the concept of interfaith dialogue, stating that it is a western tool to enforce non-Islamic policies in the Islamic world.

In Modern Orthodox Judaism, the 1964 essay &quot;Confrontation&quot; by Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik has widely been seen as &quot;a ban on theological dialogue&quot;, though it may be seen as a statement that there were not sufficient conditions for equal and respectful dialogue.

===Criticism of dialogue events===

Some critics of interfaith dialogue may not object to dialogue itself, but instead are critical of specific events claiming to carry on the dialogue. For example, the French Algerian prelate Pierre Claverie was at times critical of formal inter-religious conferences between Christians and Muslims which he felt remained too basic and surface-level. He shunned those meetings since he believed them to be generators of slogans and for the glossing over of theological differences. However, he had such an excellent knowledge of Islam that the people of Oran called him &quot;the Bishop of the Muslims&quot; which was a title that must have pleased him since he had dreamed of establishing true dialogue among all believers irrespective of faith or creed. Claverie also believed that the Islamic faith was authentic in practice focusing on people rather than on theories. He said that: &quot;dialogue is a work to which we must return without pause: it alone lets us disarm the fanaticism; both our own and that of the other&quot;. He also said that &quot;Islam knows how to be tolerant&quot;. In 1974 he joined a branch of Cimade which was a French NGO dedicated to aiding the oppressed and minorities.

<text>Man on Fire is a 2004 American vigilante action thriller film directed and produced by Tony Scott, with a screenplay by Brian Helgeland and co-produced by Arnon Milchan. It is based on the 1980 novel of the same name by A. J. Quinnell. The film stars Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning in lead roles, alongside Christopher Walken, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini, Marc Anthony, Rachel Ticotin and Mickey Rourke in supporting roles. This adaptation shifts the setting from Naples, Italy, to Mexico City, diverging from the earlier 1987 film version of Quinnell&#x27;s novel, which was also produced by Milchan.

The film follows a despondent, alcoholic former CIA officer-turned-bodyguard, who embarks on a violent revenge spree after a nine-year-old under his charge is kidnapped in Mexico City. 

&quot;Man on Fire&quot; was released in the United States by 20th Century Fox on April 23, 2004. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Washington&#x27;s performance and the film&#x27;s intense action sequences; however, it was criticized for its graphic violence and pacing. It emerged as a commercial success at the box-office, grossing $130 million worldwide against a production budget of $60–70 million. Fanning&#x27;s performances earned her nominations for the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Young Performer and the Young Artist Award for Best Leading Young Actress in a Feature Film. Additionally, the film received 2 nominations at the 36th NAACP Image Awards – Outstanding Motion Picture and Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture (Washington).

==Plot==
In 2003, former Force Recon Marine and CIA SAD/SOG officer John Creasy travels to Mexico to visit his old friend Paul Rayburn, who convinces him to take a bodyguard position with Samuel Ramos, a wealthy automaker. Samuel needs protection for his young daughter, Lupita &quot;Pita&quot; Ramos, due to a kidnapping insurance policy that requires a bodyguard to be in place.

Struggling with alcoholism and guilt from his past, Creasy initially contemplates suicide, but a misfired gun prompts him to reconsider his fate. Revitalized by the thought that he is meant to live, he takes on his role as Pita&#x27;s protector, reducing his drinking and finding solace in the Bible. As he bonds with Pita, teaching her to swim, their relationship flourishes.

However, one day, while waiting outside Pita’s piano lesson, Creasy recognizes a car that has been following them. As two federal policemen block the street, he realizes Pita is about to be kidnapped. In the ensuing chaos, he engages the attackers, killing four but sustaining serious injuries while Pita is abducted. As authorities investigate, Creasy becomes a suspect, but reporter Mariana Garcia Guerrero questions the narrative. AFI agent Miguel Manzano relocates Creasy to a veterinary clinic to protect him from corrupt officials.

The kidnappers, led by the unseen &quot;Voice&quot;, demand a $10 million ransom, which Samuel complies with, aided by Police Lieutenant Victor Fuentes. However, when the ransom drop is ambushed and the Voice&#x27;s nephew is killed, the Voice threatens the Ramos family, stating Pita will be lost forever as retribution. Manzano warns Creasy about the powerful &quot;brotherhood&quot; involved, comprising corrupt officials and criminals, and Creasy vows to kill everyone connected to the kidnapping.

With Rayburn’s help, Creasy assembles an arsenal and begins his violent quest for revenge. He brutally interrogates the getaway driver for information, leading him to confront several kidnappers and recover incriminating evidence. Guerrero discovers Fuentes&#x27; involvement in the brotherhood, prompting her and Manzano to assist Creasy in his mission. Creasy&#x27;s rampage intensifies as he confronts Fuentes, learning that Samuel&#x27;s lawyer, Jordan Kalfus, orchestrated the kidnapping to claim insurance money. 

Creasy arrives to confront Kalfus at his house but finds the lawyer&#x27;s beheaded corpse floating in the pool. Creasy then decides to confront Samuel about his involvement with the kidnapping and the ruse is revealed: Samuel and Kalfus agreed to orchestrate the kidnapping in order to pay off old debts belonging to the former&#x27;s father, and while both expected Lupita to be safely returned by paying off the ransom with the remaining insurance money, the ambush by Fuentes caused the plan to collapse, with Samuel killing Kalfus in a rage. Despondent over this revelation, Creasy gives Samuel a gun and the bullet he once used in his suicide attempt, with Samuel killing himself as Creasy leaves.

Guerrero and Manzano trace the ransom money and uncover the Voice&#x27;s identity. Creasy captures the Voice’s brother and learns that the ringleader&#x27;s real name is Daniel Sanchez. They arrange an exchange for Pita, and during the meeting, Creasy, injured but determined, reassures Pita of his love before she is sent to safety. As Creasy is taken away to the Brotherhood, he dies of his injuries en route; within the same day, Manzano executes the Voice during the latter&#x27;s arrest.

=== Alternate ending ===
In an alternate ending, Creasy survives his injuries and confronts the Voice in his office. After a tense verbal exchange, he kills both himself and the Voice in a suicide bombing, mirroring Fuentes&#x27; earlier demise.

==Production==

=== Background ===
Tony Scott, the film&#x27;s director, initially attempted to adapt the 1980 source novel by A. J. Quinnell into a film in 1983. Journalist Paul Davies speculated that film producers likely doubted Scott&#x27;s capability to direct a project of this scale, given that his only directorial effort at the time was the supernatural horror film &quot;The Hunger&quot; (1983), which would be his second film. The novel was later adapted by Élie Chouraqui in his English-language debut, also titled &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (1987), featuring Scott Glenn as Creasy. This earlier adaptation, similar to the novel, was set in Italy, which was then a prominent center for kidnappings.

=== Development and writing ===
When a remake of &quot;Man on Fire&quot; was first considered, producer Arnon Milchan, who also produced the 1987 version, initially looked at directors Michael Bay and Antoine Fuqua before reaching out to Tony Scott to see if he was still interested. 20th Century Fox intended for the film to remain set in Italy, with an early draft of the script taking place in Naples. However, Scott argued that if the setting remained in Italy, the film would need to be a period piece, as kidnappings had become increasingly rare there by the 2000s. Ultimately, Mexico City was chosen as the new setting due to its high kidnapping rate and other unspecified reasons. This shift resulted in changes to character names: Rika Balletto was renamed Lisa Martin Ramos, Pinta Balletto became Lupita &quot;Pita&quot; Ramos, and Ettore Balletto was changed to Samuel Ramos.

In adapting Quinnell&#x27;s novel, screenwriter Brian Helgeland retained much of the original dialogue, a fact that Quinnell noted favorably after the film&#x27;s release. The kidnappers in the film, brothers Daniel and Aurelio Sánchez, were allusions to the notorious &quot;Ear Lopper brothers&quot;, Daniel and Aurelio Arizmendi Lopez, who were infamous for serial kidnappings and murders. Kevin Freese of the Foreign Military Studies Office remarked that this reference appeared to go unnoticed by much of the audience.

Henry Bean served as an uncredited script doctor for the film. Additionally, the name of Pita&#x27;s dog, Sam, serves as a nod to her character&#x27;s name in the 1987 film—Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Balletto.

=== Casting ===
Robert De Niro was initially offered the role of Creasy, and Gene Hackman was also considered for the part. However, Tony Scott ultimately cast Denzel Washington in the role after they had previously collaborated on the action thriller film &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995). Marlon Brando was originally the top choice to play Rayburn, having been Scott&#x27;s first pick for the role of Creasy back in 1983.

Ricardo Darín was offered the role of The Voice but declined the opportunity.

Scott cited the epic crime film &quot;City of God&quot; (2002) as a significant influence on the film&#x27;s style, and he paid homage to that film by hiring actors Gero Camilo and Charles Paraventi for roles in &quot;Man on Fire&quot;.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography for &quot;Man on Fire&quot; took place in Mexico, primarily in Mexico City, Ciudad Juárez, and Puebla. Interior scenes were filmed at Estudios Churubusco. Marcelo Ebrard, who was the Chief of Police for Mexico City at the time, served as a consultant to the producers, with the hope that the film would raise awareness about the ongoing issue of kidnappings in the region.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Man on Fire&quot; opened in the U.S. on April 23, 2004, in 2,980 theaters, grossing $22,751,490 during its opening weekend, with an average of $7,634 per theater, ranking #1 at the box-office. The film&#x27;s widest release expanded to 2,986 theaters, ultimately earning $77,911,774 in North America and $52,381,940 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $130,293,714 against a production budget of $60–70 million. Additionally, the film performed well in the U.S. home video market, generating over $123 million in DVD and VHS rentals and sales.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Man on Fire&quot; holds a rating of 39% based on 168 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The consensus notes that &quot;&quot;Man on Fire&quot;&#x27;s solid action and top-shelf cast are undone by a relentlessly grim story that gets harder to take the longer it goes on.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews.&quot; However, audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale from A to F.

Paul Davies, a journalist, observed that the critical reception of &quot;Man on Fire&quot; in the United States was &quot;somewhat less than kind,&quot; largely due to critics&#x27; disapproval of Creasy&#x27;s vigilantism. Davies argued that &quot;most critics missed&quot; that Creasy does not take &quot;sadistic pleasure&quot; in his actions; instead, he kills to extract information and pursue those involved in Pita Ramos&#x27;s kidnapping, aiming to avoid harming innocent parties.

A. J. Quinnell, the author of the original novel, had a favorable reception to this adaptation, particularly praising the film for incorporating many lines from the book. He noted that he typically dislikes film adaptations but felt the writers &quot;did a good job with &quot;Man on Fire&quot;,&quot; and he loved the chemistry between Creasy and Pita. Quinnell expressed initial shock at Denzel Washington being cast as Creasy, stating, &quot;When I first heard Denzel was playing the part of Creasy, I missed a couple of heartbeats,&quot; but ultimately commended Washington&#x27;s performance, acknowledging the film&#x27;s violence and the importance of portraying Creasy&#x27;s anger effectively.

===Accolades===
==Soundtrack==
The cut &quot;Smiling&quot; from the soundtrack of &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, composed and conducted by Harry Gregson-Williams, was adopted as the theme for several television commercials for Omega watches from 2012 to 2013. The soundtrack, featuring 20 tracks, was released on July 27, 2004.

Additionally, the film prominently features music by Nine Inch Nails, with lead singer Trent Reznor credited as &quot;Musical Consultant.&quot; The soundtrack includes six songs by Nine Inch Nails.

==Remake==
In 2005, a Hindi remake of &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, titled &quot;Ek Ajnabee&quot;, was directed by Apoorva Lakhia and starred Amitabh Bachchan in the lead role, renamed Suryaveer &quot;Surya&quot; Singh. Additionally, the film was also remade in Tamil that same year as &quot;Aanai&quot;, featuring Arjun Sarja in the lead role.

<text>South Georgia is an island in the South Atlantic Ocean that is part of the British Overseas Territory of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. It lies around east of the Falkland Islands. Stretching in the east–west direction, South Georgia is around long and has a maximum width of . The terrain is mountainous, with the central ridge rising to at Mount Paget. The northern coast is indented with numerous bays and fjords, serving as good harbours.

Discovered by Europeans in 1675, South Georgia had no indigenous population due to its harsh climate and remoteness. Captain James Cook in made the first landing, survey and mapping of the island, and on 17 January 1775 he claimed it a British possession, naming it &quot;Isle of Georgia&quot; after King George III. Through its history, it served as a whaling and seal hunting base, with intermittent population scattered in several whaling bases, the most important historically being Grytviken. The main settlement and the capital today is King Edward Point near Grytviken, a British Antarctic Survey research station, with a population of about 20 people.

==History==
The island of South Georgia was probably discovered in 1675 by Anthony de la Roché, a London merchant, and was named &quot;Roche Island&quot; on a number of early maps. It was sighted by a commercial Spanish ship named &quot;León&quot; operating out of Saint-Malo on 28 or 29 June 1756. According to Argentine historians, it was explored on 29 June 1756, St Peter&#x27;s Day, hence its Spanish name &quot;Isla San Pedro&quot;, literally &quot;St Peter&#x27;s Island&quot;.

The mariner Captain James Cook in made the first landing, survey and mapping of South Georgia. As mandated by the Admiralty, on 17 January 1775 he took possession for Britain and renamed the island &#x27;Isle of Georgia&#x27; for King George III.

After making a foot crossing of the island with Tom Crean and Frank Worsley, Ernest Shackleton organised the rescue of his party from Elephant Island following the disaster that befell the 1916 Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which he led. He is buried in the cemetery at Grytviken alongside Frank Wild.

Commercial sealing was conducted on the island between 1786 and 1913. During that period 131 sealing visits are recorded, eight of which ended when the vessel was wrecked. Modern industrial sealing associated with whaling stations was carried out between 1909 and 1964. Sealing era relics include iron try pots, hut ruins, graves and inscriptions, and the South Georgia Museum was established on the island in 1992.

===Surveying by Carse===
The island was surveyed by explorer Duncan Carse. He organised and led the South Georgia Survey of 1951–1957, surveying much of the interior of the island. Mount Carse and Carse Point are named after him. In 1961 he lived as a hermit in a remote part of South Georgia. Carse built a house at Ducloz Head on the southern coast of the island, intending to live there through the winter. However, in May, three months into the experiment, surge waves destroyed his camp. He managed to salvage enough gear to survive the winter until making contact with a ship 116 days later.

His knowledge and mapping proved helpful to the British during the Falklands conflicts.

=== Argentine occupation ===
On 19 March 1982, a group of Argentinians arrived at Leith Harbour and raised the Argentine flag on the island. On 3 April, the second day of the Falklands War, Argentine naval forces occupied the island. South Georgia was retaken by British forces on 25 April during Operation Paraquet.
==Geography and fauna==

The island&#x27;s climate is classified as an ET or polar tundra climate on the Köppen-Geiger classification system. It has no tree cover, and there is generally snow on the island during the winter months (April–November). The terrain is mountainous, with a central ridge and many fjords and bays along the coast. South Georgia is a breeding ground for elephant seals, fur seals, and king penguins. The island is home to the South Georgia pintail and the South Georgia pipit, which are endemic to the island.

There are 25 native vascular plants on South Georgia, and 76 non-native species have been recorded.

The island&#x27;s topography includes a stepped sequence of flat surfaces interpreted as wave-cut platforms formed when sea level was higher relative to the island. At sea level strandflats have been described.

In 2013, teams of Norwegian government shooters and Sámi reindeer herders culled all 3,500 reindeer on the island. The animals had been introduced by Norwegian whalers in the early 20th century for food and sport hunting, but were later seen as a pest, damaging the island&#x27;s flora and wider ecosystem. Karl Erik Kilander, the project manager, said the culled reindeer were frozen and taken to the Falkland Islands where they were sold to local residents and cruise ship operators.
In 2018, after a multiyear extermination effort, the island was declared free of invasive rodents and the number of South Georgia pipits had clearly increased. In the central north coast, five years after poisoning the rats, the populations of snowy sheathbills, South Georgia pintails and Wilson&#x27;s storm petrels had grown.

The island lies in the path of large icebergs drifting northward from Antarctica. Iceberg A-38 grounded off the island in 2004, resulting in indirect but severe effects on local wildlife by disturbing life on the seafloor and blocking foraging routes of seals and penguins. In 2020, the colossal Iceberg A-68, similar in size to the island itself, was initially believed to be on a similar collision course but broke apart before collision with the island.

<doc id="525308" wikidata="Q268072" url="?curid=525308" title="Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics">
<text>The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (; IBGE) is the agency responsible for official collection of statistical, geographic, cartographic, geodetic and environmental information in Brazil. IBGE performs a decennial national census; questionnaires account for information such as age, household income, literacy, education, occupation and hygiene levels.

IBGE is a public institute created in 1936 under the name &quot;National Institute of Statistics&quot;. Its founder and chief proponent was statistician Mário Augusto Teixeira de Freitas. The current name dates from 1938. Its headquarters are located in Rio de Janeiro, and its current president is Marcio Pochmann, replacing Eduardo Rios Neto. It was made a federal agency by Decree-Law No. 161 on February 13, 1967, and is linked to the Ministry of the Economy, inside the Secretariat of Planning, Budget and Management.

== Structure ==

IBGE has a network of national research and dissemination components, comprising:
* 27 state units (26 in state capitals and one in the Federal District);
* 27 centres for documentation and dissemination of information (26 in the capital and one in the Federal District);
* 27 units for the supervision of territorial mapping (26 in the capital and one in the Federal District);
* 585 data collection agencies in major cities.
* Headquarters in Rio de Janeiro (the capital of the Republic when the Office was established).

Also in Rio are five boards and a school: Executive Directors (ED), Directorate of Research (DPE), Department of Geosciences (DGC), Department of Informatics (DI), Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination (CDDI) and the , a degree-granting institution.

The Directorate of Research is responsible for planning and coordinating the research of nature and processing of statistical data collected by the state units; the Department of Geosciences is responsible for basic cartography, the national geodetic system, with a survey of natural resources and environment and by survey and geographical studies.

The Center for Documentation and Information Dissemination is responsible for documentation and dissemination of information produced by the institute as well as coordinating the 27 CDDIs in the country, and the National School of Statistical Sciences, besides being responsible for training the institute&#x27;s employees, is a federal institution of higher learning that offers the following courses: BA in statistics; specialization in Environmental Analysis and Management Planning, and Masters in Population Studies and Social Research.

The IBGE also maintains the Roncador Ecological Reserve, situated 35 km south of Brasília.

==System of national accounts==
Gives an overview of the economy and describes the phenomena of economic life: production, consumption and wealth accumulation, providing a comprehensive and simplified representation of these data. The System of National Accounts IBGE follows the most recent UN recommendations expressed in the Handbook of National Accounts (System of National Accounts &quot;1993&quot;, SNA), including the calculation of &quot;Gross Domestic Product&quot; (GDP) and the &quot;Input-output matrix&quot;.

===Quarterly national accounts===
Displays the current value and volume indices (1991 = 100) every quarter for the &quot;Gross Domestic Product&quot; at market prices, taxes on products, value added at basic prices, personal consumption, government consumption, Gross fixed capital formation, changes in inventories, exports and imports of goods and services. Two series of index numbers are calculated: the basis of the previous year and chained with reference to 1990 (1990 = 100). The series is seasonally adjusted using X-12-ARIMA, enabling calculation of the rates of change over the previous quarter.

The IBGE survey was started in 1988 and restructured after 1998, when their results were integrated into the current System of National Accounts. The annual weights are derived from this new system accounts.

== Archives ==
IBGE maintains the following archives (non-exhaustive list):
:* Municipal Agricultural Production (MAP)
:* Municipal Livestock Survey (PPM)
:* Extraction Plant and Forestry Research (PEVS)
:* Annual Survey of Industry (full model) (PIA-C)
:* Annual Survey of Industries (simplified form) (PIA-S)
:* Annual Survey of Industries (product) (PIA-Prod)
:* Annual Survey of Construction Industry (Paice)
:* Annual Survey of Trade (simplified model) (PAC-S)
:* Annual Survey of Trade (full model) (PAC-C)
:* Annual Services Survey (PAS)
:* Continuous National Sample Survey of Households (PNADC)
:* Monthly Survey of Employment and Wages (PIMES)
:* Monthly Industrial Survey of Physical Production (PIM -PF)
:* Monthly Survey of Trade (PMC)
:* Monthly Survey of Services (PMS)
:* Household Budget Survey (POF)

== Requirement and confidentiality of information ==
The legislation, according to Federal Decree No. 73,177 of November 20, 1973 and Law No. 5534 of November 14, 1968, modified by Law No. 5878 of May 11, 1978, deals with the obligation and confidentiality of information collected by IBGE, which is intended exclusively for statistical purposes and has no legal value, not being usable as evidence or proof.

Failure to provide information within the specified deadlines, or providing false information is a crime subject to a fine, initially, of up to 10 times the highest minimum wage in the country, and up to twice this limit on later occasions.

== Some economic indicators released by the IBGE ==
:* National System of Consumer Price Indices
::* National Index of Consumer Prices (INPC)
::* Broad National Consumer Price Index (IPCA)
::* National Index of Construction (INCC)

==Censuses==
===Population census ===
The best known census is the population census (). First conducted in its modern form in 1872, it is now conducted every ten years, usually in years ending in zero. No census took place in 1880, 1910 or 1930.

The census is conducted solely by the IBGE, as enshrined in law. Comprehensive demographic data is collected on the population (including age, income, sex, etc.), as well as housing stock. Unlike approaches taken in other countries (e.g., the United States), the questionnaire asks respondents to self-identify by skin color, phrasing the question as &quot;Color or Race&quot;.

The most recent census was conducted in 2010; the 2020 census was delayed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==== Population counts ====
A simpler population count &quot;(contagem de população)&quot; is theoretically made in the interval between two censuses, starting in 1996. These aim to update the data on the number of inhabitants, of great importance to Brazil&#x27;s cities, because annual grants from the Municipalities Participation Fund are determined mainly by population. The IBGE is responsible for estimating populations annually for every municipality in the country, and these population counts enhance the quality of estimates.

The first population count was conducted in 1996, not only to update population data, but also to get municipality level data after the emergence and redefinition of new municipalities after the census of 1991. The most recent count was done in 2007, delayed from 2005 because of budgetary concerns, and the 2016 count was completely cancelled for similar reasons.

===Agricultural census ===
The agricultural census collects information on agricultural establishments, forests and/or aquaculture of all municipalities of the country. The goal of this research is to update previous census data and to provide information about economic, social, and environmental farming. Since 1996, the census has occurred roughly every 10 years.

The 1996 agricultural census was conducted by IBGE from August 1995 to July 1996, in reference to Brazil&#x27;s crop harvests. The following agricultural census was undertaken in 2007, and surveyed agricultural activity for the 2006 calendar year. The 2017 agricultural census returned to a survey period based on crop harvests, and was conducted from October 2016 to September 2017, with results released in 2018.

<text>Marcus Sergius was a Roman general during the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC). He is famed in prosthetics circles as the first documented user of a prosthetic hand. The metal hand was constructed to allow him to hold his shield in battle.

A description of Marcus Sergius is found in the seventh book of Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, published in AD 77:

:&quot;Nobody - at least in my opinion - can rightly rank any man above Marcus Sergius, although his great-grandson Catiline shames his name. In his second campaign Sergius lost his right hand. In two campaigns he was wounded twenty-three times, with the result that he had no use in either hand or either foot: only his spirit remained intact. Although disabled, Sergius served in many subsequent campaigns. He was twice captured by Hannibal - no ordinary foe- from whom twice he escaped, although kept in chains and shackles every day for twenty months. He fought four times with only his left hand, while two horses he was riding were stabbed beneath him.&quot;

:&quot;He had a right hand made of iron for him and, going into battle with this bound to his arm, raised the siege of Cremona, saved Placentia and captured twelve enemy camps in Gaul - all of which exploits were confirmed by the speech he made as praetor when his colleagues tried to debar him as infirm from the sacrifices. What piles of wreaths he would have amassed in the face of a different enemy!&quot;

<text>The middle finger, long finger, second finger, third finger, toll finger or tall man is the third digit of the human hand, located between the index finger and the ring finger. It is typically the longest digit. In anatomy, it is also called &quot;the third finger&quot;, &quot;digitus medius&quot;, &quot;digitus tertius&quot; or &quot;digitus III&quot;.

==Overview==
In Western countries, extending the middle finger (either by itself, or along with the index finger in the United Kingdom: see V sign) is an offensive and obscene gesture, widely recognized as a form of insult, due to its resemblance of an erect penis. It is known, colloquially, as &quot;flipping the bird&quot;, &quot;flipping (someone) off&quot;, or &quot;giving (someone) the finger&quot;. 

The middle finger is often used for finger snapping together with the thumb.

<doc id="525314" wikidata="Q485983" url="?curid=525314" title="Shrek 2">
<text>Shrek 2 is a 2004 American animated fantasy comedy film loosely based on the 1990 children&#x27;s picture book &quot;Shrek!&quot; by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson, Kelly Asbury, and Conrad Vernon from a screenplay by Adamson, Joe Stillman, and the writing team of J. David Stem and David N. Weiss, it is the sequel to &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and the second installment in the &quot;Shrek&quot; film series. The film stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz, who reprise their respective voice roles of Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona. They are joined by new characters voiced by Antonio Banderas, Julie Andrews, John Cleese, Rupert Everett, and Jennifer Saunders. &quot;Shrek 2&quot; takes place following the events of the first film, with Shrek and Donkey meeting Fiona&#x27;s parents as the zealous Fairy Godmother, who wants Fiona to marry her son Prince Charming, plots to destroy Shrek and Fiona&#x27;s marriage. Shrek and Donkey team up with a sword-wielding cat named Puss in Boots to foil her plans.

Development began in 2001, and following disagreements with producers, the first film&#x27;s screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio were replaced with Adamson. The story was inspired by &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot; (1967), and new animation tools were utilized to improve the visual appearance of each character, particularly Puss in Boots. The lead actors also received a significant bump in salary to $10 million, which at the time was among the highest contracts in their respective careers. Like its predecessor, &quot;Shrek 2&quot; also parodies other films based on fairy tales and features references to American popular culture. The film is dedicated to the memory of &quot;Shrek&quot; creator William Steig, who died on October 3, 2003, eight months before the film was released.

&quot;Shrek 2&quot; premiered at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2004, where it competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or, and was released in theaters on May 19, by DreamWorks Pictures. Like its predecessor, it received positive reviews from critics and is considered by many to be one of the best sequel films ever made. The film grossed $935 million worldwide. It scored the second-largest three-day opening weekend in United States history and the largest opening for an animated film at the time of its release. It went on to become the highest-grossing film of 2004 and the fourth-highest-grossing film overall at the time of its release. &quot;Shrek 2&quot; is also DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date and the highest-grossing film released by DreamWorks Pictures, and it held the title of being the highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide until Pixar Animation Studios&#x27; &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; surpassed it in 2010. The film received two Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song, and its associated soundtrack charted in the Top 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Two sequels—&quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007) and &quot;Shrek Forever After&quot; (2010)—had soon followed. The film&#x27;s character Puss in Boots has also received his own series of spin-off media—&quot;Puss in Boots&quot; (2011), &quot;The Adventures of Puss in Boots&quot; (2015–2018) and &quot;Puss in Boots: The Last Wish&quot; (2022)—following his debut.

==Plot==

Newlyweds Shrek and Princess Fiona return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona&#x27;s parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Fiona convinces a reluctant Shrek to attend, and they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away with Donkey in tow. They meet Fiona&#x27;s parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see the ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument, and Fiona, disgusted at their behavior, locks herself away in her room. Shrek worries that he is losing Fiona, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.

Harold is secretly reprimanded by the Fairy Godmother, who had arranged with Harold for her son Prince Charming to marry Fiona. She orders Harold to get rid of Shrek or else lose his own happy ending, so Harold arranges for local outlaw Puss in Boots to assassinate the ogre.

Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to be an ally. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss sneak into the Fairy Godmother&#x27;s factory and steal a &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; potion that Shrek thinks will make him good enough for Fiona. He and Donkey drink the potion and soon fall asleep. Back in Far Far Away, Fiona prepares to find Shrek so they can return home, but she too falls asleep.

The next morning, Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona awaken to find that the two ogres are now humans, and Donkey is a white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle; however, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the theft, has sent Charming to pose as human Shrek and win Fiona&#x27;s love. At the Fairy Godmother&#x27;s urging, Shrek leaves the castle, believing that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.

Fiona is skeptical of Charming; therefore, to ensure the two will wed, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona&#x27;s tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal knights after Donkey inadvertently exposes them. While the ball begins, the fairy tale creatures whom Shrek and Donkey had met during their previous adventure arrive at the dungeon and rescue the trio. They all storm the castle with the help of Mongo, a monstrous living gingerbread man created by the Muffin Man.

Shrek fails to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love, Fiona knocks him out. Harold reveals that he swapped Fiona&#x27;s tainted teacup with his own, refusing to go through with the plot. Enraged, the Fairy Godmother tries to strike Shrek with a spell from her magic wand. Harold jumps in front of it, reverting into the Frog Prince; the rest of the spell reflects off his breastplate and hits the Fairy Godmother, causing her to be disintegrated into bubbles.

With the Fairy Godmother gone, Harold apologizes, admitting to using the &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; potion years earlier to gain Lillian&#x27;s love. He approves Shrek and Fiona&#x27;s marriage, while Lillian assures Harold that she still loves him. As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona declines Shrek&#x27;s offer to remain human, and they revert into ogres, while Donkey also returns to normal. In a mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had recently married Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies.

==Production==
In 2001, soon after the original &quot;Shrek&quot; proved to be a hit, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz negotiated an upfront payment of $10 million each for voicing a sequel to the film. This pay increase represented a significant rise from the $350,000 salary that each of the three were paid for the first film. According to Jeffrey Katzenberg, the executive producer of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; and a co-founder of DreamWorks Pictures, who led the negotiations, the payments were probably the highest in the actors&#x27; entire careers. Each of the actors were expected to work between 15 and 18 hours in total. The film was produced with a $70 million budget.

Director Andrew Adamson returned to direct &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, after previously directing the first &quot;Shrek&quot; film. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the screenwriters and co-producers of the first film, insisted that the sequel would be a traditional fairytale, but after disagreements with the producers, they left the project and were replaced by Adamson. His writing for &quot;Shrek 2&quot; was inspired by the 1967 comedy-drama film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;, and was completed with the help of the film&#x27;s co-writers Joe Stillman (one of the other writers from the first film), and screenwriting duo J. David Stem and David N. Weiss, and co-directors, Kelly Asbury and Conrad Vernon, the latter two of whom spent most of the film&#x27;s production duration in Northern California while Adamson spent most of his time with the film&#x27;s voice actors in Glendale, California.

DreamWorks began production of &quot;Shrek 2&quot; in 2001, before the first &quot;Shrek&quot; film was completed. The studio added more human characters to the film than there were in its predecessor and improved character appearance and movement with the use of several new animation/rendering systems. In particular, Puss in Boots necessitated development of a whole new set of film production tools to handle the appearance of his fur, belt, and hat plume; Puss&#x27; fur especially required an upgrade to the fur shader. All of the character setup was completed in the first three years of production.

In an early version of &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, Shrek abdicated the throne, and called for a fairy tale election. Pinocchio&#x27;s campaign was an &quot;honesty&quot; campaign, while Gingy&#x27;s was a &quot;smear&quot; campaign. Adamson said that although this plot did have many funny ideas, it was also too overtly satiric and political, and considered &quot;more intellectual than emotional&quot;. &quot;Shrek 2&quot; also appears much darker in terms of lighting when compared to the original film. Designers reportedly took inspiration from 19th century French illustrator and engraver Gustav Doré to improve the film&#x27;s richness of detail and setting. According to production designer Guillaume Aretos, &quot;There are a lot of medieval paintings and illustrations [and] my own influences, which are classical paintings from the 15th and 16th centuries...The design of Shrek is always a twist on reality anyway, so we tried to [pack] as much detail and interest as we could in the imagery.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;Shrek 2&quot; was composed solely by Harry Gregson-Williams, who returned after composing the score for the first &quot;Shrek&quot; film, marking it as his fifth film with DreamWorks Animation. The soundtrack reached the 8th position on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 1st on the US Soundtracks (&quot;Billboard&quot;). It also features two versions of the 1980s Bonnie Tyler hit &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;.

==Release==
In April 2004, the film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.

&quot;Shrek 2&quot; was originally scheduled for release on June 18, 2004. The film was then moved forward from June 18, 2004, to May 21, 2004; however, due to &quot;fan demand&quot;, it was released two days earlier from May 21, 2004, to May 19, 2004. A day before the film went to theaters, the first five minutes were shown on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;U-Pick Live&quot;.

Playing in 4,163 theaters over its first weekend in the United States, &quot;Shrek 2&quot; was the first film with over 4,000 theaters in overall count. Over 3,700 theaters was its count for an opening day.

In July 2014, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures (owners of the pre-2005 DreamWorks Pictures catalog) and transferred to 20th Century Fox before reverting to Universal Pictures in 2018.

The film was theatrically re-released in the United States for one week beginning on April 12, 2024 in celebration of its twentieth anniversary.

===Home media===
&quot;Shrek 2&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on November 5, 2004 and on Game Boy Advance Video on November 17, 2005. It became one of the best-selling DVD releases of all time with over 37 million copies being sold grossing $458 million.

A 3D-converted version of the film was released exclusively with select Samsung television sets on Blu-ray on December 1, 2010, along with the other three films of the series. A non-3D version was released on December 7, 2010, as part of the &quot;Shrek: The Whole Story&quot; box set, and a stand-alone Blu-ray/DVD combo pack was released individually on August 30, 2011, along with the other two films of the series. A stand-alone 3D Blu-ray version of the film was released on November 1, 2011. The DVD release features two full-length commentary tracks, one by co-directors Conrad Vernon and Kelly Asbury, and a second by producer Aron Warner and editor Michael Andrews. &quot;Shrek 2&quot; was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 22, 2022, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.

====&quot;Far Far Away Idol&quot;====

&quot;Far Far Away Idol&quot; is a special feature on the DVD and VHS release based on &quot;American Idol&quot; and guest starring Simon Cowell. Taking place right after &quot;Shrek 2&quot; ends, the short features characters from &quot;Shrek&quot; compete in a sing-off while being judged by Shrek, Fiona, and Cowell.

After the performances, on the DVD release, the viewer gets to pick the winner. If any character besides Shrek, Fiona, Donkey, or Puss is selected, an alternate ending plays where Cowell would refuse to accept the winner and proclaim himself the victor, leaping onto the judging table and performing his &quot;own&quot; rendition of &quot;My Way&quot;. At the end of the VHS release, it gives a link to a website where the viewer can vote for their favorite to determine the ultimate winner. DreamWorks Animation announced on November 8, 2004, three days after the DVD and VHS release, that with 750,000 votes cast, the &quot;winner&quot; of the competition was Doris.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened at No. 1 with a Friday-to-Sunday total of $108 million, and $129 million since its Wednesday launch, from a then-record 4,163 theaters, for an average of $25,952 per theater over the weekend. At the time &quot;Shrek 2&quot;″s Friday-to-Sunday total was the second-highest opening weekend, only trailing &quot;Spider-Man&quot;″s $114.8 million. In addition, Saturday alone managed to obtain $44.8 million, making it the highest single-day gross at the time, beating &quot;Spider-Man&quot;″s first Saturday gross of $43.6 million. The film remained at No. 1 in its second weekend, expanding to 4,223 theaters, and grossing another $95.6 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, narrowly beating out the $85.8 million four-day tally of new opener &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. It spent ten weeks in the weekly Top 10, remaining there until July 29, and stayed in theaters for 149 days (roughly twenty-one weeks), closing on November 25, 2004. The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 2, 2004, and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends, before being dethroned by &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;.

The film grossed $441.2 million domestically (US and Canada) and $487.5 million in foreign markets for a total of $935.3 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of both 2004 and in its franchise. This also puts the film at 14th on the all-time domestic box office list and 42nd on the worldwide box office list. The film sold an estimated 71,050,900 tickets in the US.

The film also took away the highest worldwide gross made by an animated feature, which was before held by &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (2003), although the latter still had a higher overseas-only gross. With DVD sales and &quot;Shrek 2&quot; merchandise estimated to total almost $800 million, the film (which was produced with a budget of $150 million) is DreamWorks&#x27; most profitable film to date.

&quot;Shrek 2&quot; remained the highest-grossing animated film worldwide until the release of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; (2010), and held the record for the highest-grossing animated film at the North American box office until the release of &quot;Finding Dory&quot; (2016) as well as the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film at this box office until the release of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; in 2023. It also remained the highest-grossing non-Disney animated film worldwide until it was surpassed by &quot;Despicable Me 2&quot; in 2013.

===Critical response ===
&quot;Shrek 2&quot; received positive reviews from critics. The film has an approval rating of based on professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of . Its critical consensus reads, &quot;It may not be as fresh as the original, but topical humor and colorful secondary characters make &quot;Shrek 2&quot; a winner in its own right.&quot; Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned &quot;Shrek 2&quot; a score of 75 out of 100 based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, saying it is &quot;bright, lively, and entertaining&quot;, and Robert Denerstein of &quot;Denver Rocky Mountain News&quot; called it &quot;sharply funny&quot;. James Kendrick of &quot;QNetwork&quot; praised the plot, calling it &quot;familiar, but funny&quot;. J. R. Jones of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; called it &quot;unassailable family entertainment&quot;, and similar to the first film. Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;better and funnier than the original&quot;.

Though he wrote that it is not as good as the first film, Kevin Lally of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; described it as &quot;inventive and often very funny&quot;. Peter Rainer of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, however, stated the film &quot;manages to undo much of what made its predecessor such a computer-generated joy ride.&quot;

Sean Naughton of &quot;Complex&quot; described it as &quot;one of the best-animated sequels ever&quot;.

===Accolades ===
&quot;Shrek 2&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. It won five awards at the 31st People&#x27;s Choice Awards: &quot;Favorite Animated Movie&quot;, &quot;Favorite Animated Movie Star&quot; for &quot;Donkey&quot; (Eddie Murphy), &quot;Favorite Movie Comedy&quot;, and &quot;Favorite Movie Villain&quot; for &quot;Fairy Godmother&quot; (Jennifer Saunders), and &quot;Favorite Sequel&quot;. It also won a Teen Choice Award in the category of &quot;Choice Award Choice Movie – Comedy&quot;. The film was nominated at the 3rd Visual Effects Society Awards in the category of &quot;Outstanding Performance by an Animated Character in an Animated Motion Picture.&quot;

Along with &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but lost to &quot;The Incredibles&quot;. One of the film&#x27;s songs, &quot;Accidentally in Love&quot; received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated the film for its Top 10 Animation Films list.

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a complete bipartite graph or biclique is a special kind of bipartite graph where every vertex of the first set is connected to every vertex of the second set.

Graph theory itself is typically dated as beginning with Leonhard Euler&#x27;s 1736 work on the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. However, drawings of complete bipartite graphs were already printed as early as 1669, in connection with an edition of the works of Ramon Llull edited by Athanasius Kircher. Llull himself had made similar drawings of complete graphs three centuries earlier.

== Definition ==
A complete bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two subsets and such that no edge has both endpoints in the same subset, and every possible edge that could connect vertices in different subsets is part of the graph. That is, it is a bipartite graph such that for every two vertices and, is an edge in . A complete bipartite graph with partitions of size and , is denoted ; every two graphs with the same notation are isomorphic.

== Examples ==

* For any , is called a star. All complete bipartite graphs which are trees are stars.
** The graph is called a claw, and is used to define the claw-free graphs.
* The graph is called the utility graph. This usage comes from a standard mathematical puzzle in which three utilities must each be connected to three buildings; it is impossible to solve without crossings due to the nonplanarity of .
* The maximal bicliques found as subgraphs of the digraph of a relation are called concepts. When a lattice is formed by taking meets and joins of these subgraphs, the relation has an Induced concept lattice. This type of analysis of relations is called formal concept analysis.
== Properties ==

*Given a bipartite graph, testing whether it contains a complete bipartite subgraph for a parameter  is an NP-complete problem.
*A planar graph cannot contain as a minor; an outerplanar graph cannot contain as a minor (These are not sufficient conditions for planarity and outerplanarity, but necessary). Conversely, every nonplanar graph contains either or the complete graph as a minor; this is Wagner&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Sabrina “Brini” Maxwell is the drag persona of Ben Sander, described as the &quot;prototypical, pre-feminist, 1960s homemaker.&quot; Maxwell has also been described as a composite of Doris Day, Mary Tyler Moore, Auntie Mame, That Girl, and Donna Reed; the character came to prominence in the late &#x27;90s as the host of her eponymous television show on public access in Manhattan, and later on the national cable television Style Network.

The name Brini came from a Stefanie Powers mini-series called &quot;Deceptions&quot; while Maxwell originated from Barbara Streisand&#x27;s character in &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;

==Television==

===Cable access show===

The pilot for the original &quot;Brini Maxwell Show&quot; debuted on Manhattan Neighborhood Network on January 1, 1998. The program originally started out as &quot;At Home with Tigs&quot; and centered on a drag character called Tigs Vanderveer, but the character and the show quickly morphed into the &quot;Brini Maxwell Show.&quot; The show aired for five years featuring tips, recipes, entertaining ideas, craft projects, home renovation and interior design schemes. It was produced by Sander&#x27;s production company, V.R.U.S.P. Inc., and directed by Sander&#x27;s mother, the actress Mary Jane Wells. Sanders cast many of the drag queens he met at the Imperial Court - one of the oldest and largest LGBT organizations in the world - as characters on the show, such as Thom Hansen (aka Panzi) and Philip Stoehr (aka Philomena). The show had a diverse, cult following: &quot;Brini (rhymes with &quot;teeny&quot;) has received hundreds of letters and e-mail messages since the show began ... Brini has a wide following that extends beyond gay viewers. Many of those who write in are straight fans who say they tape the show for friends around the country.&quot;

In 1999, Maxwell was nominated for the Glam Award for Best TV Performer along with three other drag queens - Cookie, Hedda Lettuce, and Cherry Jubilee - and on December 2 she won the honor. It was reported that &quot;some 300 drag queens and their guests burst into sustained applause as Brini, dressed in an ivory floor-length skirt with a side slit, a black sweater and a Mongolian lamb&#x27;s wool wrap, swooshed through the crowd at Life at 158 Bleecker Street and onto the stage to accept the award.&quot;

===&quot;Charming, Needs Work&quot;===

In 2001 Sander was contacted by Amy Briamonte, east coast director of development for west coast based Termite Art Productions, a division of Lionsgate Television. Briamonte and Sander developed a pitch for the show for the Bravo network and received an order for a pilot. The pilot was produced in the summer of 2002 for a show titled &quot;Charming, Needs Work&quot;. 

====Premise====
The premise for the show was Maxwell lived in an apartment that she redecorated every week. This concept was difficult to show in a pilot because it&#x27;s based on the cumulative experience of seeing the changes each week. The pilot showed the transformation from un-remodeled apartment to finished and decorated space with segments about painting a super-graphic, having a piece of furniture reupholstered, making a stuffed dog using a new crafting technique featuring old concert T-shirts and a location segment with Kim Cattrall in her apartment.

===&quot;The Brini Maxwell Show&quot;===

After Bravo passed on the show Briamonte, Sander, and Termite Art pitched it to Stephen Schwartz and Heather Moran, newly named VP&#x27;s of programming for the Style network, then a sister network to E! Entertainment Television. The pitch resulted in an order for a 13-episode season.

====Production====
The first season of &quot;The Brini Maxwell Show&quot; for the Style network was taped in the summer of 2003 with studio production taking place on the main stage at Unitel Studios on west 57th St. in New York City. Location shoots for the season were taped over a period of six months in New York City, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas. &quot;The Brini Maxwell Show&quot; debuted on the Style network on Thursday, January 1, 2004 at 10 p.m.

The second season went into production in the summer of 2004 and debuted in November 2005.

====Episodes====
====Cancellation====
The show was cancelled after two seasons when Comcast hired Ted Harbert to helm the E! family of networks.

==Publications==
===&quot;Brini Maxwell&#x27;s Guide to Gracious Living&quot;===
In 2004, Sander was contacted by Ron Longe, then a publicist at Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, a division of Abrams Books about publishing a Brini Maxwell book. The resulting book, &quot;Brini Maxwell&#x27;s Guide to Gracious Living&quot; is divided into four sections - Daily Life, dealing with the basics of life, including eating well, creating a nice environment for yourself and defining your personal style; Entertaining, preparing for hosting parties and events and menus for them; Travel, making your forays into the world smoother and more organized and Life&#x27;s Happy Milestones, how to mark the important moments in your life with style and panache. 

Production on the book commenced in late 2004 with dedicated photo shoots done by photographer, Bradford Noble. The design was done by Tamar Cohen with original illustrations done by Karen Hsu. The book was published on October 1, 2005, with an initial printing of 15,000 copies. It was promoted with a book tour of the east and west coasts, including book launch parties at Phyllis Morris in Los Angeles and Trina Turk in Palm Springs. 

====Reception====
The book was featured in the New York Magazine approval matrix for November 14th, 2005 with the blurb &quot;Buy it for the irony, keep it for the truly good advice&quot; in the position of just below the midline between highbrow and lowbrow and almost half way past the midline between brilliant and despicable. The Advocate (LGBT magazine) said &quot;You&#x27;ll flip your wig over this indispensable guidebook from the Style network&#x27;s fiercest hostess&quot;

==Ben Sander==

Early Life

Sander was born on July 23, 1969, at Boston Lying In Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, to Peter and Mary Jane. The first seven years of his life were spent in Wellesley, MA with his father teaching theater at Brandeis University and his mother alternately keeping house and acting in professional productions in Boston and New York as well as touring with her own one-woman adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. In 1976 the family moved to the small college town of Athens, Ohio, home of Ohio University. Ben attended elementary and middle school in Athens while his father taught in the graduate theater program there. In 1980 Peter Sander received a Pell grant and moved the family to Cleveland, Ohio, where he acted as a dramaturge for The Cleveland Play House. The Playhouse offered Ben his first opportunity to act professionally. He was cast as Bodo in a production of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;. The family returned to Athens in 1981 for two years. In 1983 Peter took a job with The University of Missouri in Kansas City, where Ben attended Center Senior High School. Ben performed in high school theatrical productions, but eventually forsook the stage for the costume room, becoming the costume designer during his senior year, using his extensive collection of vintage clothing as costumes for the productions that year. After graduating high school in 1987, Sander attended the Kansas City Art Institute foundations program.

In 1988 the family again moved; this time to Hempstead, Long Island, where his father had been hired as the chair for the theater department of Hofstra University. Ben worked at various jobs in New York City and also studied fashion illustration with Veronica Galati. He then applied to, and was accepted into the fashion design program at Fashion Institute of Technology in 1989. After four years of study, Sander graduated in 1993, and obtained a job at moderate dress house, BGB as an assistant designer. His job was making patterns for the samples; the company reorganized nine months after he was hired and he was let go. After that he worked at a bridal boutique, and two furriers before moving into Manhattan and developing &quot;The Brini Maxwell Show&quot; for television.

<doc id="525323" wikidata="Q859471" url="?curid=525323" title="Tsukiji fish market">
<text>is a major tourist attraction for both domestic and overseas visitors in Tokyo.
Located in Tsukiji in central Tokyo between the Sumida River and the upmarket Ginza shopping district, the area contains retail markets, restaurants, and associated restaurant supply stores. Before 2018, it was the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world.
The market opened on 11 February 1935 as a replacement for an older market that was destroyed in the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake. It was closed on 6 October 2018, with wholesale operations moving to the new Toyosu Market. The area where the old market was located was demolished and will be rebuilt into a new economic complex featuring a brand new stadium for the Yomiuri Giants of the Nippon Professional Baseball.

The market was supervised by the of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Industrial and Labor Affairs.

==Location==

The market is located near the Tsukijishijō Station on the Toei Ōedo Line and Tsukiji Station on the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line. There were two distinct sections of the market as a whole, but after the transfer to Toyosu, only the outer market remains.
The inner market (&quot;jōnai-shijō&quot;) was the licensed wholesale market, where approximately 900 licensed wholesale dealers operated small stalls and where the auctions and most of the processing of the fish took place. The outer market (&quot;jōgai-shijō&quot;) is a mixture of wholesale and retail shops that sell Japanese kitchen tools, restaurant supplies, groceries, and seafood, and many restaurants, especially sushi restaurants. Most of the shops in the outer market closed by the early afternoon. Visitors were only admitted to the inner market from 10.00 am (11.00 am by the time the market was moved), by which time the activity in the market had reduced significantly or almost ceased. At times, the inner wholesale market was entirely closed to visitors. A small number of visitors however were allowed into the inner market in the early morning to see the tuna auction.

==History==
===Origin===
The land on which the fish market sat was created during the Edo period by the Tokugawa shogunate after the Great fire of Meireki of 1657. It was created through land reclamation on the Tokyo Bay, and the area was therefore named Tsukiji (築地), meaning &quot;constructed land&quot; or &quot;reclaimed land&quot;. The fish market however was not sited here until the 20th century.

The first fish market in Tokyo was originally located in the Nihonbashi district, next to the Nihonbashi bridge that gave the area its name. The area was one of the earliest places to be settled when Edo (as Tokyo was known until the 1870s) was made the capital by Tokugawa Ieyasu, and the market provided food for the Edo Castle built on a nearby hill. Tokugawa Ieyasu took a number of fishermen from Tsukuda, Osaka to Edo to provide fish for the castle in 1590. Fish not bought by the castle was then sold near the Nihonbashi bridge, at a market called &quot;uogashi&quot; (literally, &quot;fish quay&quot;).

In August 1918, following the so-called Rice Riots (&quot;Kome Sōdō&quot;), which broke out in over 100 cities and towns in protest against food shortages and the speculative practices of wholesalers, the Japanese government was forced to create new institutions for the distribution of foodstuffs, especially in urban areas. A Central Wholesale Market Law was established in March 1923.

The Great Kantō earthquake on 1 September 1923 devastated much of central Tokyo, including the Nihonbashi fish market. The Tokyo government, which already had plans to relocate the market due to its unsanitary conditions considered unsuitable for an area that had developed into a business center, then took the opportunity to move the market to the Tsukiji district.

===Construction and opening===

Following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake architects and engineers from the Architectural Section of Tokyo Municipal Government were sent to Europe and America to do research for the new market. However, because of the sheer size of the market and the number of items traded they were forced to come up with their own unique design. The quarter circular shape allowed easier access and handling for freight trains and the steel structure above allowed a wide, continuous space free from columns and subdivisions. The relocation of the market would be one of the biggest reconstruction projects in Tokyo after the earthquake, taking over six years involving 419,500 workers.

Tsukiji was officially opened on February 11, 1935. On the same day, Tōkyō-Shijō station (東京市場駅) was opened with tracks designed around the market area. In this year, the big three markets (Tsukiji, Kanda and Koto) began operations as Tokyo Metropolitan Government&#x27;s system of Central Wholesale Markets. And then, smaller branch markets (Ebara fruit and vegetables market, Toshima market, Adachi market and Meat market) were opened one by one in succession.

=== Relocation to Toyosu Market ===
After World War II, Tsukiji&#x27;s transaction increased in volume, and its facilities became narrow and old fashioned. Relocation plans had been considered since the late 1950s. The candidate place was Ohi, current Ohta market. However the plan could not get consensus among stakeholders. There was another plan in the late 1980s to construct provisional market utilizing the vast site of Shiodome Freight Terminal, and rebuild advanced market facilities in Tsukiji area during that period. However the negotiation with Japanese National Railways was not unsuccessful.

in 1998, six industry groups participating to Tsukiji market submitted a request in their joint signature to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to conduct a study and hold discussion of an opportunity about relocating market functions to Tokyo Waterfront Area, four of them were for the relocation and the remaining two were against. Throughout 1999, related municipal or urban engineering studies were conducted and discussing committees were held. In 2000, six industry groups and Tokyo Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to relocate.

The Tsukiji fish market occupies valuable real estate close to the center of the city. Former Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara repeatedly called for moving the market to Toyosu, Koto. The long-anticipated move to the new Toyosu Market (豊洲市場) was scheduled to take place in November 2016, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but on August 31, 2016, the move was postponed. There had been concerns that new location was heavily polluted and needed to be cleaned up. The groundwater at the site contained contaminants that &quot;far exceeded environmental limits&quot;, which was mitigated by installing additional water pumps. There were plans to retain a retail market, roughly a quarter of the current operation, in Tsukiji. The remaining area of the market would be redeveloped.

In June 2017, plans to move the fish market were restarted. but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018. On 3 August 2017, a fire broke out in some of the outer buildings.

After the new site had been declared safe following a cleanup operation, the opening date of the new market was set for 11 October 2018. Tsukiji market closed on 6 October 2018, with the businesses of the inner market relocated to the new Toyosu Market between 6 and 11 October. Even though Tsukiji inner market has moved to Toyosu, the outer market remains, selling food and other goods. The former market was used temporarily as a hub for transport vehicles during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. 

On April 19, 2024, it was announced that the area where the market was located will be redeveloped into a new economic and entertainment area centralized with a new stadium for the Yomiuri Giants.

==Economics==

The market handled more than 480 different kinds of seafood as well as 270 types of other produce, ranging from cheap seaweed to the most expensive caviar, and from tiny sardines to 300 kg tuna and controversial whale species. Overall, more than 700,000 metric tons of seafood are handled every year at the three seafood markets in Tokyo, with a total value in excess of 600 billion yen (approximately 5.4 billion US dollars in August 2018). At Tsukiji, around 1,628 tons of seafood worth 1.6 billion yen ($US14 million) may have been sold on a typical day. There were around 900 licensed dealers at the market, and the number of registered employees varied from 60,000 to 65,000, including wholesalers, accountants, auctioneers, company officials, and distributors.

==Operations==

Until it closed in 2018, the market opened most mornings (except Sundays, holidays and some Wednesdays) at 3:00 a.m. with the arrival of the products by ship, truck and plane from all over the world. Particularly impressive was the unloading of tons of frozen tuna. The auction houses (wholesalers known in Japanese as &quot;oroshi gyōsha&quot;) then estimate the value and prepare the incoming products for the auctions. The buyers (licensed to participate in the auctions) also inspected the fish to discern which they would like to bid for and at what price.

The auctions started around 5:20 a.m. Bids can only be made by licensed participants. These bidders include intermediate wholesalers (&quot;nakaoroshi gyōsha&quot;) who operated stalls in the marketplace and other licensed buyers who were agents for restaurants, food processing companies, and large retailers.

The auctions usually ended around 10:00 a.m. Afterward, the purchased fish was either loaded onto trucks to be shipped to the next destination or on small carts and moved to the many shops inside the market. There the shop owners cut and prepare the products for retail. In case of large fish, for example tuna and swordfish, cutting and preparation was elaborate. Frozen tuna and swordfish were often cut with large band saws, and fresh tuna is carved with extremely long knives (some well over a meter in length) called &quot;oroshi-hōchō, maguro-bōchō&quot;, or &quot;hanchō-hōchō&quot;.

The market was the busiest between 6:30 and 9:00 a.m., and the activity declined significantly afterward. Many shops started to close around 11:00 a.m., and the market closed for cleaning around 1:00 p.m. Tourists visited the market daily between 5 a.m. and 6:15 a.m. and watched the proceedings from a designated area, except during periods when it was closed to the public.

Because of an increase in sightseers and the associated problems they cause, the market banned all tourists from the tuna auctions on several occasions, including from 15 December 2008 to 17 January 2009, 10 December 2009 to 23 January 2010, and 8 April 2010 to 10 May 2010. After the latest ban that ended in May 2010, the tuna auctions were re-opened to the public with a maximum limit of 120 visitors per day on a first-come, first-served basis. Visitor entry into the interior wholesale markets was prohibited until after 11:00 am. Due to the March 2011 earthquakes all tourists were banned from viewing the tuna auctions till 26 July 2011, from which date it was reopened.

Inspectors from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government supervised activities in the market to enforce the Food Hygiene Law.

<text>Fort George was a military fortification in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada. The fort was used by the British Army, the Canadian militia, and the Jeffersonian American Republic Army for a brief period. The fort was mostly destroyed during the War of 1812. The site of the fort has been a National Historic Site of Canada since 1921, and features a reconstruction of Fort George.
The British established Fort George in the 1790s to replace Fort Niagara. Many of its structures were demolished in May 1813, during the Battle of Fort George. After the battle, American forces occupied the fort for seven months before withdrawing in December 1813. Although the British regained the fort shortly afterwards, little effort was put into its reconstruction after they captured Fort Niagara the following week. The poor wartime design of Fort George led to its replacement by Fort Mississauga in the 1820s, although the grounds of Fort George saw some use by the military until the end of the First World War. During the late-1930s, the Niagara Parks Commission built a reconstruction of Fort George. The site was opened in 1940, and has been managed as a historic site and living museum by Parks Canada since 1969.

The fort has irregular-shaped earthwork with six bastions and a number of reconstructed buildings within it. The restored gunpowder magazine is the only building that dates to the original Fort George. The fort forms a part of Fort George National Historic Site, which also includes Navy Hall to the east of the fort. The historic site serves as a learning resource for the War of 1812, 19th-century military life in Canada, and the historic preservation movement during the 1930s.

==Background==
A fort was first considered on the site by Gother Mann of the Royal Engineers. The fort was intended to serve as a secondary fort to Fort Niagara, assisting in that fort&#x27;s defence in the event it was attack. Fort George&#x27;s large size was due to its original purpose as a supply depot, rather than as a true defensive fortification. The fort neither defended the mouth of the river, nor any approach to the adjacent settlement. 
However, after the Jay Treaty was signed, British forces were required to withdraw from U.S. territory, including Fort Niagara. In 1791, land was formally set aside to build new fortifications on the high ground adjacent to the Navy Hall at Niagara-on-the-Lake. The site was selected by members of the Royal Engineers, as its elevation was higher than the elevation of Fort Niagara.

==History==
Although the British set aside land near Navy Hall to build a new fort, the British Army did not begin construction of Fort George, or its withdrawal from Fort Niagara until 1796, after the Jay Treaty was signed. Fort George was completed in the same year with a blockhouse/barracks, a stone gunpowder magazine, and two small warehouses. In an attempt to negate this advantage, American forces built a battery on an elevated river bank opposite of Fort George. In an effort to counter the American battery, the British built a half moon battery southeast of Fort George. Fort George was largely manned by members of 2nd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Volunteers (Macdonell’s Battalion) after British forces withdrew a number of soldiers from Upper Canada.

Tensions with First Nations and the U.S. government in the late 1790s prompted British forces to refortify the colony, including the fort itself. Six earthen and log bastions, connected by a wooden palisade, and surrounded by a ditch were built around the fort; with the fort containing five log blockhouses/barracks, a hospital, kitchens, workshops, and officers&#x27; quarters by the start of the 19th century. Timber was obtained from trees felled in the area; and transported via the Niagara River. Most of the fort was built by members of the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Volunteers, a unit that was later disbanded in 1802.

By 1812, the fort was used as the headquarters for the central division of the British Army and a depot for the Indian Department. Believing Fort George was too large to defend given the number of soldiers he had available, Major-General Isaac Brock drafted plans to reduce the size of the fort by a third. Specifically, he proposed to abandon the southern bastions, the octagonal blockhouse, and the stone gunpowder magazine, while erecting palisades to cut off the abandoned sections from the rest of the fort.

===War of 1812===
Shortly after the American declaration of war, work on the northeast bastion was undertaken by members of the York Militia. When the fort was manned by British during the war, the fort was occupied by British Army regulars; members of the Canadian militia, including the Captain Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men; and First Nation allies.

Given the fort&#x27;s location near the Canada–United States border, the fort became the centre of several military actions during the War of 1812. In October 1812, the fort was subject to bombardment with heated shots from American forces in Fort Niagara, as a diversion for the American assault on Queenston Heights. The diversionary bombardment, in addition to another bombardment in November 1812 led to the destruction of several buildings in the fort. After Brock&#x27;s death at Queenston Heights, he was buried in a military funeral at Fort George&#x27;s northeast bastion.

====Battle of Fort George====
The Battle of Fort George began on 25 May 1813, when Fort George was subjected to an artillery barrage and heated shots from Fort Niagara, and newly built and fortified shore batteries, resulting in the destruction of the log buildings within the fort. Two days later, an American landing force of 2,300 troops disembarked in four waves approximately from Fort George, on the shoreline of Lake Ontario under the cover of cannonade fire. By the third landing wave Brigadier General John Vincent realized that his force of 560 men were at risk of being outflanked, and trapped at Fort George; resulting in him giving the order to destroy the fort&#x27;s ammunition, to spike its guns, and to retreat and evacuate the fort. First Nations warriors under John Norton covered the British retreat, although the Americans made no real effort to pursue them.

The Americans advanced cautiously towards the fort, wanting to avoid any potential casualties against a potentially sabotaged gunpowder magazine; which occurred at the conclusion of the Battle of York. American forces were able to prevent the destruction of a substantial portion of what remained of the fort, having arrived quickly enough for a U.S. artillery captain to extinguish one of the magazine fuses.

====American occupation====
Although the British evacuated the fort on 7 June, American forces did not formally occupy the fort until 9 June. Once the Americans occupied the fort, they immediately began work on new fieldworks, refortifying the bastions of the fort, and extending the northwest bastion; with the fort serving as the U.S. Army of the center&#x27;s headquarters. Although American forces used some parts of the fort&#x27;s old fieldwork, the fort was made substantially smaller, into a more defensible pentagonal-shape fort. In addition to rebuilding the earthwork ramparts, they also repaired the palisades, and added entrenchments near the northeast bastion and towards the river. However, they did not erect any other permanent structures in the fort, with its forces instead garrisoning in small outlying outposts around the fort.

The fort was largely modified to defend the American encampment adjacent to the fort from an attack from inland. The Americans intended to use the encampment as a staging ground for an invasion further into the Niagara peninsula. During its seven-month occupation of the fort, the American military initially brought more soldiers to the fort in preparation for their advance, and raised a local volunteer corps (Upper Canadian Volunteers), making it the only military unit to be raised within the fort during the war. 

Although the fort was intended to act as a bridgehead for an American invasion of the peninsula, the American military was forced to reconsider its invasion plans after facing several setbacks; including disease, increased desertion rates, continued risk of ambush outside the confines of the encampment, and a British advance towards the area after the battles at Stoney Creek, and Beaver Dams. Plans to advance further inland were eventually scrapped, and American forces commenced a slow withdrawal from the fort; with only 60 soldiers remaining in Fort George by December 1813. Upon receiving intelligence that 1,500 British and 700 First Nations warriors were advancing onto the fort, the American garrison was ordered to withdraw, and to raze the fort and the adjacent settlement. The American garrison left the fort on 11 December after spiking the fort&#x27;s guns and razing the settlement; although they did not destroy what remained of the fort.

====British reoccupation====
British forces arrived at the fort shortly after the Americans departure from the town, finding the only remaining buildings in the fort being the gunpowder magazine, and some temporary magazines erected by the Americans. Shortly after reoccupying the fort, the British began working on building a temporary barracks, officers&#x27; quarters, guardhouse, and another magazine. Nine days after reoccupying the fort, British forces conducted an assault that led to the capture of Fort Niagara, and the razing of communities on the American side of the river in retaliation for the burning of Niagara. As Fort Niagara remained occupied by the British for the remainder of the war, British military focus shifted towards the more strategically placed Fort Niagara; with no further investments made in maintaining Fort George.

In July 1814, American forces under Winfield Scott attempted to seize forts George and Niagara. However, Scott was forced to withdraw after realizing the naval support he was promised would not materialize.

===Post-War of 1812===

In 1817, American president James Monroe visited the Canadian side of the Niagara River during a goodwill trip, and was entertained by British officers at the fort. However, Fort George&#x27;s inability to guard the mouth of the Niagara River was criticized by military analysts after the war, leading to the construction of Fort Mississauga near the mouth of the river in the 1820s. During the same period, work on Butler&#x27;s Barracks was undertaken southwest of the fort, and out of range of the batteries on the American side of the river.

The equipment within the fort was later auctioned away in 1821, and its palisades relocated to other sites in the next year. By 1825, the body of Isaac Brock was disinterred from the northeast bastion, and placed at Brock&#x27;s Monument in Queenston. In 1828, the headquarters of British Army centre division was formally moved to York, with the fort reportedly only made up of a few &quot;wooden decaying barracks&quot;. In 1839, Navy Hall was converted into a barracks for the British garrison, with the fort&#x27;s former barracks being converted to a stables.

During the 1860s, the Canadian government took control of the British military complex in the area, which included Fort George, Fort Mississauga, Butler&#x27;s Barracks, and the training commons; although the ruins of Fort George saw little use from the Canadian militia. The ruins of the fort was intermittently leased to a private citizen, who acted as a custodian-tenant of the property. During this period, several buildings were converted for other uses; with the officers&#x27; quarters incorporated into a farmhouse, the stone gunpowder magazine used for storing hay, and the property itself used as a grazing field for cattle. By the 1880s the bastions and the gunpowder magazine were in poor condition, portions of the fort were being used as farmland, with only the officers&#x27; quarters occupied by a custodian. 

In 1882, the Wright family was granted a lease from the Department of Militia and Defence; which led to the opening of a golf club in the area, with the golf course occupying portions of the ruins. The golf course was transformed into an eighteen-hole course in 1895, further expanding into the ruins in 1895. The fort&#x27;s ruins were the subject of controversy when the golf club proposed clearing the ruins of the fort. As the golf club&#x27;s membership was predominantly made up of American residents summering in the area, the proposal was subject to criticism from local and Toronto-based newspapers that published nationalistic editorials critical of the proposal; describing it as a &quot;desecration of sacred heroic sites as [selling out] to Sabbath-breaking Americans&quot;. Facing stiff criticism, the golf club eventually abandoned their plans for the fort ruins. The golf club ceased operations shortly before the First World War.

During the First World War, the Canadian military built a military hospital on the site of the fort&#x27;s esplanade, with a mess, kitchen, and guardhouse and lands adjacent to the fort; collectively known as &quot;Camp Niagara&quot;. The buildings remained in use by the military until the end of the war.

===Conversion into a historic site===

On 21 May 1921, the site was named as a National Historic Site of Canada, with a stone cairn placed on the site. During the mid-1930s, the Department of National Defence accepted an offer from the Niagara Parks Commission, where the commission would reconstruct and restore Fort George, Fort Mississauga, and the Navy Hall, in return for a 99-year lease on all three properties for C$1 per year; although the department reserved the right to reclaim the properties after providing six-months notice.

The commission began to restore the Navy Hall in August 1937, which was followed by restoration efforts to the fort&#x27;s gunpowder magazine. However, the fort&#x27;s officers&#x27; quarters were torn down and relocated to another part of the fort; while the buildings erected during the First World War were relocated outside the fort. During this period, bulldozers were also used to push the fort&#x27;s earthen ramparts into place. The surrounding area was also cleared of overgrowth, resulting from the site&#x27;s intermittent abandonment. In 1939, reconstruction of the fort&#x27;s former buildings, in addition to a visitor centre outside of the fort took place. White pine was imported from northern Ontario in order to facilitate the building&#x27;s construction. The fort reconstruction was completed in 1939 with the installation of its wooden gates, although its visitor centre remained under construction for several months after. Reconstruction and restoration efforts were largely guided by the fort&#x27;s original 1799 designs; and were largely completed through make-work programs, with the head of the Niagara Parks Commission, Thomas McQuesten, also serving as the provincial Minister of Public Works. Wood used during the reconstruction effort were pressurized with creosote for longevity, with the material lasting until 2010.

Fort George was included in the 1939 royal tour of Canada, although the royal cavalcade only passed by the fort, having never stepped inside it. The Niagara Capital Commission had initially planned a &quot;grand opening&quot; of the site; although the outbreak of the Second World War resulted in these proposals being shelved, deemed &quot;inappropriate&quot; in the midst of a war. Fort George was opened to the public on 1 July 1940; although its &quot;official opening and dedication&quot; did not occur until June 1950, with a flypast provided by the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the United States Air Force. The Niagara Parks Commission operated the fort as a museum, exhibiting military artifacts in the reconstructed blockhouses.

In 1969, the lease with the commission was prematurely ended when the property was transferred from the Department of National Defence to Parks Canada. In 1987, a citizen cooperating association, the Friends of Fort George, was formed. From 2009 to 2010, several archaeological digs were conducted to ascertain the landscape of the fort, as well as excavate artifacts left behind by soldiers during the war.

==Grounds==
The fort, and its surrounding grounds are operated by Parks Canada as the Fort George National Historic Site of Canada. The national historic site includes the fort, and a visitor reception centre situated outside the fort. West of the fort is the Commons, of green space that separates the Fort George National Historic Site from Butler&#x27;s Barracks, another National Historic Site of Canada.

The only structure on the historic site that dates back to the original fort is the stone gunpowder magazine, with the majority of the buildings on the site dating back to the fort&#x27;s reconstruction in the 1930s. All the historic reconstructed structures are considered &quot;level 2 cultural resources,&quot; as they provide the fort&#x27;s &quot;historical character,&quot; a learning resource for the development of historical sites through make-work programs during the Great Depression, and illustrate the methods used by historic preservation movement in the 1930s.
===Fort===

Although the fort was modified several times in the early 19th century, the 1937–39 reconstruction configured the layout of the fort to resemble its 1799 configurations. However, as a serious archaeological survey was not conducted prior to its reconstruction, several differences exist between the reconstruction and the original 1799 fort; most notably differences with the rampart&#x27;s placement and a difference in the blockhouses&#x27; appearances. Additionally, as the bulldozers were used to reshape the fort&#x27;s earthworks, the fort&#x27;s interior terrain was significantly flattened, resulting in a flatter topography when compared the original fort.

The gunpowder magazine is the only original building in the fort. Reconstructed buildings in the fort include the four blockhouses, a single storey officers&#x27; kitchen, a single-storey rectangular officers&#x27; quarters built in a Colonial Revival-style, and a rectangular guardhouse with a gabled roof clad in cedar shakes. All the reconstructed buildings are loose interpretation of the original structures, with the designs based on the architect&#x27;s interpretation of a frontier fort. As a result, the historical designation is confined to the footprint of the buildings. The fort&#x27;s artificer&#x27;s and blacksmith shop, was also constructed during the 1930s reconstruction of the fort, although the building itself is not based on any historical antecedent. The building is used as a modern workshop, although it was designed in the same aesthetic as the other reconstructed buildings.

====Blockhouses====

The fort features three blockhouses inside the fort&#x27;s palisades, all of which were completed in 1939. All three blockhouses are two-storey log structures, whose second storey overhangs from the first. They all also feature a low pitched roof, clad in cedar shakes. However, the present blockhouses found inside the palisades were not designed after the original blockhouses of Fort George, but instead were designed based on existing blockhouses at Fort York.

The blockhouses were designed with an exposed log exterior, based on the architect&#x27;s interpretation of a rugged &quot;frontier&quot; aesthetic, although clapboards were added onto the blockhouses to give them a more refined appearance. Blockhouse 1 and 3 are square-shaped whereas Blockhouse 2 is a large, rectangular-shaped blockhouse. As opposed to the other blockhouses, Blockhouse 3 is accessed through an exterior staircase that leads to its second storey access point. Blockhouse 3 also houses storage rooms, change rooms, lunch rooms, and washrooms for Parks Canada staff.

In addition to the three blockhouses inside the palisades, there is also another blockhouse located on the palisades of the fort, near the south redan; also completed during the fort&#x27;s reconstruction. As with the other blockhouses it is two storeys tall and features an overhanging second storey; although unlike the other blockhouses, it takes the shape of an octagon. The only access point to the octagonal blockhouse is through a tunnel from inside the fort. As with the other blockhouses, the aesthetic of the reconstructed octagonal blockhouse was based on the ones from Fort York.

====Gunpowder magazine====
The fort&#x27;s gunpowder magazine is the only structure in the fort that dates back to the fort&#x27;s original construction in 1796. In addition to being the fort&#x27;s oldest building, the magazine is also one of Niagara-on-the-Lake&#x27;s oldest buildings. Although the fort was built on elevated ground above Navy Hall, the gunpowder magazine was built over a depression of a ravine; making the roof the only part of the building visible from Fort Niagara. A drainage system was required to drain the moisture collected from the ravine shortly after the magazine&#x27;s completion, in order to preventing the floor boards from rotting. Until the fort&#x27;s gunpowder magazine was completed, the original Navy Hall was briefly used as an ammunition store after the British transferred their garrison from Fort Niagara to Fort George. Shortly after the gunpowder magazine&#x27;s was completed, defensive earthworks were created to the northeast of the magazine in an effort to further fortify it.

The walls are made of limestone likely quarried from nearby Queenston. The interior was built with bricks, with a brick arch to reinforce its roof. The small windows and doors are sheathed in copper, preventing any accidental ignition of the gunpowder from sparks. The double-layered wooden floors were also pegged to the ground as opposed to nailed. In spite of these features however, the building itself was not shell-proof, and may be liable to fires as a result of accidents or enemy action.

Although the gunpowder magazine was situated in the portion of the fort that was abandoned by Isaac Brock, it remained in use. During the Battle of Queenston Heights, the metal covering on the magazine&#x27;s roof was set ablaze, although the Garrison quickly removed the metal coverings and extinguished the fire. Although the fort was largely abandoned by the British in the 1820s in favour of Fort Mississauga, the magazine remained in use by Fort Mississauga&#x27;s garrison until the 1830s. During the mid-19th century, the building was occasionally occupied by squatters.

The building could store 300 barrels of gunpowder, a second stone and brick gunpowder magazine was built, though that magazine was abandoned and reported &quot;in ruins&quot; by 1814.

====Ramparts====

The ramparts of the fort were made up of irregular earthworks consisting of six bastions, each framed with timber and connected by a line of picketing. The earthworks were bulldozed into place during the 1930s. As opposed to the present earthworks, which were largely bulldozed in place, the original fort&#x27;s earthworks were built using wooden cribs over the ravine gully, and using inundated clay to stabilize the soil. Because bulldozers were used for the earthworks reconstruction, only the area around the two northern bastions have a resemblance with the original fort&#x27;s configuration.

Because the fort was designed as a supply depot and not a true defensive fortification, the earthwork&#x27;s bastions were poorly positioned, with a lack of interlocking lines of fire creating areas of vulnerability at certain parts of the ramparts. Attempts to rectify these deficiencies were made prior to the War of 1812, when Isaac Brock instructed that the fort&#x27;s size be reduced, by abandoning the southern ramparts and erecting palisades at the new defensive line. Further modifications made to the fort&#x27;s original ramparts during the Americans occupation of the fort, transforming it into a smaller, more defensible pentagonal fort. These modifications are not reflected in the reconstructed Fort George, with the restoration process restoring the fort to its 1799 configuration; although the archaeological remains of the American dug entrenchments next to the fort are still visible.

===Navy Hall===

In addition to the fort, Fort George National Historic Site also contains Navy Hall, a reconstructed historical building below the eastern ramparts of the fort at the shoreline of the Niagara River. The original Navy Hall predates the construction of the original Fort George, with the building having served as the barracks for the Provincial Marine, and the larger area being used as a shipyard and supply depot for Fort Niagara. During the late 1780s and early 1790s, the building was intermittently used by the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe as a private residence. Simcoe&#x27;s offices were made into an officers&#x27; mess for soldiers in Fort George; while the rest of the building was used as storage for the Provincial Marines. An American artillery barrage in November 1812 led to the destruction of the original Navy Hall. 

The British rebuilt Navy Hall, and a new wharf shortly after the end of the war; albeit one that was slightly smaller. By 1840, Navy Hall was modified to fit a barracks; and the area surrounded with a guardhouse, customs house, ferry house, and taverns. However, these buildings were relegated to storage use by the 1850s. In an effort accommodate the construction of the Erie and Niagara Railway Navy Hall was moved closer to the fort ruins, and was later converted for use as a stable During the First World War, the building was partially renovated after it was converted into a laboratory for the Canadian Medical Corps. However, it was abandoned again after the war, resulting in its deterioration. After the Erie and Niagara Railway line closed, process of reconstruct the building at its original location was undertaken. A new stone foundation was used, with the building&#x27;s facade largely encased in stone; while the lumber was salvaged from an old barn.

In 1969, Navy Hall was also designated a National Historic Site of Canada, although it remains associated with the Fort George National Historic Site. As with the other reconstructed buildings in Fort George, Navy Hall&#x27;s historical designation is restricted to the building&#x27;s footprint. Like the other reconstructed buildings at the historic site, Navy Hall has not been evaluated by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada for possible national significance, and is considered a &quot;level 2 cultural resource&quot; for the historic site.

==Museum operations==

Parks Canada operates the fort as a living museum providing visitors a glimpse of military life in 19th century Upper Canada, as well as exhibits on the War of 1812. A number of its exhibits focus on lieutenant governor Simcoe, as well as the Provincial Marine, the maritime equivalent of the Canadian militia.

The museum contains several artifacts that originate from the fort during the War of 1812 period, including a portrait of an officer from the 100th Regiment of Foot that was stationed; a sword believed to be carried by an officer of the Royal Engineers, and a sword belt plate from the Lincoln and Welland Militia.

<doc id="525327" wikidata="Q7794129" url="?curid=525327" title="Thomas S. Wootton High School">
<text>Thomas S. Wootton High School or Wootton High School (WHS) is a public high school in Rockville, Maryland. Its namesake is Thomas S. Wootton, the founder of Montgomery County, Maryland. The school was founded in 1970 and is part of the Montgomery County Public Schools system.

== Academics ==
In 2019, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Wootton&#x27;s STEM program #160 in a nationwide survey of US high schools. In 2022, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Wootton #167 nationally amongst high school. As of 2024, Wootton ranks 195th nationally and 4th in Maryland.

Wootton students average a score of 1288 on the SAT, with 634 on verbal and 654 on math.

==History==

In November 2001, President George W. Bush visited Wootton and signed the congressional bill officially recognizing &quot;Veterans Awareness Week&quot;, which takes place the week before Veteran&#x27;s Day.

In 2015, school principal Michael Doran was found dead in his Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. A memorial service was held at Wootton two days later. In 2017, a bridge near the high school and its auditorium was named in Doran&#x27;s honor.

On April 18, 2024, an 18-year-old trans student by the name of Andrea Ye was arrested by the Montgomery County Police Department for shooting threats made against the school. The FBI contacted the MCPD, after which they proceeded to obtain a search warrant to investigate her home, where they discovered violent drawings and documents relating to mass violence, including a 129-page long manifesto, containing numerous threats of violence against the student population and staff of Wootton High School. Authorities say that Ye, a local resident at the time, had a difficult past when she was sent to the hospital in December 2022 for similar threats as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts, but was still preoccupied after being released the following month.

==Controversies==
On October 9, 2020, former football coach Christopher Papadopolous was sentenced to 18 months in jail with 5 years of probation with his addition to the Maryland sex offender registry. Papadopolous pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse of a minor and one count of fourth-degree sex offense. These charges stemmed from his sexual assault of several 17-year-old minors in his home in Gaithersburg.

On November 2, 2021, a report of a sexual assault occurring in the school&#x27;s locker room was received by Montgomery County Police. Members of the school&#x27;s varsity team were allegedly involved in this incident. Several students and staff members were interviewed in an investigation with officers from the police department&#x27;s Special Victims Investigation Division. However, the investigation yielded no evidence of an occurrence of a sexual assault.

As of February 22, 2025, Douglas Nelson, the principal of the high school, is on administrative leave, due to his failure to properly respond to reports of racism amongst the student body. Dr. Joseph Bostic has taken his place as acting principal.

Its infrastructure is aging, a cause of concern for many students and teachers alike. It was found to have lead in its water, but those issues have not been fixed as of 2018. However, Montgomery County Public School Student Member of the Board candidates of 2023 are promising to fix this.

== Areas served ==
Most students attending Wootton live in Rockville, with others residing in Gaithersburg, Potomac, Travilah, and North Potomac.

Wootton feeds from two middle schools and six elementary schools:

* Cabin John Middle School
** Cold Spring ES
** Stone Mill ES
* Robert Frost Middle School
** DuFief ES
** Fallsmead ES
** Lakewood ES
** Travilah ES

=== Future boundary changes ===
Wootton is one of the schools in the scope for the new Crown High School, which has an expected completion date of August 2027.

==Demographics==

During the 2022–2023 school year, the school&#x27;s racial composition was 37.3% white, 38.3% Asian, 11.8% Black, and 8.2% Hispanic. Multiracial students made up less than 5% of the student body, as did Native and Pacific Islander American students. The overall size of the student body was 1,911.

<text>Europol, officially the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation, is the law enforcement agency of the European Union (EU). Established in 1998, it is based in The Hague, Netherlands, and serves as the central hub for coordinating criminal intelligence and supporting the EU&#x27;s Member States in their efforts to combat various forms of serious and organized crime, as well as terrorism.

Europol&#x27;s main objective is to enhance the effectiveness and cooperation between the law enforcement agencies of the EU member states. To achieve this, Europol facilitates the exchange of information and intelligence, provides analytical support, and offers specialized training and expertise. Some of the key areas of focus for Europol include drug trafficking, human trafficking, cybercrime, money laundering, and counterterrorism.

The Agency has no executive powers, and its officials are not entitled to arrest suspects, conduct independent investigations, or act without prior approval from competent authorities in the member states. Instead, Europol&#x27;s role is to support and facilitate the efforts of national law enforcement agencies within the EU.

==History==
=== Origins and establishment ===
Europol has its origins in TREVI, a forum for security cooperation created amongst European Community interior and justice ministers in 1976. At first, TREVI focused on international terrorism, but soon started to cover other areas of cross-border crime within the Community. At the European Summit in Luxembourg on 28–29 June 1991, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called for the creation of a European police agency similar to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—thus sowing the seeds of police cooperation across Europe. At the Summit, the European Council agreed to establish &quot;a Central European Criminal Investigations Office (Europol) by 31 December 1993 the latest.&quot;

The idea of the Luxembourg Summit was further elaborated at the European Council in Maastricht on 9–10 December 1991, a meeting to draft the Maastricht Treaty. The European Council agreed to create &quot;a European police office (Europol) the initial function of which would be to organize exchange of information on narcotic drugs&quot;. The Council likewise instructed TREVI ministers to take measures in setting up the office. On 7 February 1992, Europol was enshrined with more substance in Article K.1, section 9, as the Maastricht Treaty was signed:[...] Member States shall regard the following areas as matters of common interest: [...] police cooperation for the purposes of preventing and combatting terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects of customs cooperation, in connection with the organization of a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European Police Office (Europol).Europol was first de facto organised provisionally in 1993 as the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU) in Strasbourg at the same site as the Schengen Information System was hosted. The small initial group started operations there in January 1994 under the leadership of Jürgen Storbeck and with a mandate to assist national police forces in criminal investigations. The competition for the permanent site of Europol during the period was between The Hague, Rome and Strasbourg—the European Council decided on 29 October 1993 that Europol should be established in The Hague. A former Roman Catholic boys school built in 1910 at Raamweg 47 was chosen as the precise location. The house was used in World War II by police and intelligence agencies and after the War staffed by the Dutch State Intelligence Service until Europol relocated there later in 1994.

The Europol Convention was signed on 26 July 1995 in Brussels and came into force on 1 October 1998 after being ratified by all the Member States. The European Police Office (Europol) commenced its full activities on 1 July 1999.

=== Reformation as a European Union agency ===
Europol was fully integrated into the European Union with Council Decision 2009/371/JHA of 6 April 2009. It replaced the Europol Convention and reformed Europol as an EU agency (i.e. subject to the general rules and procedures applicable to all EU agencies) on 1 January 2010 due to different aspirations, such as enhanced support to Member States on countering serious and organised crime, budgetary control by the European Parliament, and administrative simplification.

The Agency&#x27;s new 32 000 m2 headquarters building, designed by Frank Wintermans, was opened by then Queen, now Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands on 1 July 2011 in the international zone of The Hague next to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) at Eisenhowerlaan 73.

=== European Cybercrime Centre ===
On 11 January 2013, Director Rob Wainwright and European Commissioner for Home Affairs Cecilia Malmström launched the &quot;European Cybercrime Centre&quot; (EC3 or EC3), a unit of Europol tasked with assisting Member States to dismantle and disrupt cybercrime committed by organised groups to generate large criminal profits (e.g. online fraud), causing serious harm to victims (e.g. online child sexual exploitation) or affecting critical infrastructure and systems in the EU. The purpose of the centre is to coordinate cross-border law enforcement activities against cybercrime and act as a centre of technological expertise, such as tool development and training. Commissioner Malmström stated that the need for a cybercrime centre in Europe was &quot;to protect the open and free internet&quot;. On 25 January 2016, the European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC) was launched as a new strategic platform within Europol to share information among EU states in tracking movements of Europeans into and from Syria as well as to monitor terrorists&#x27; finances and militants&#x27; Internet usage.

=== Exceptions to opt-out ===
When the UK exercised its opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice in 2014, its request to continue participating in Europol was approved.

Denmark was not permitted to participate in the 2016 recast Europol Regulation due to its opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice. In a December 2015 referendum it rejected converting its opt-out to a case-by-case opt-in, which would have allowed it to participate in the new regulation and remain a member of Europol. However, Denmark and the European Union agreed on a co-operation deal in December 2016. The agreement was accepted by both the European Parliament and the Danish Parliament on 27 April 2017 and subsequently signed on 29 April 2017—two days before Denmark would have been cut off from the Agency.

The UK also did not originally participate in the recast 2016 Europol Regulation, but subsequently notified the EU of its desire to participate in December 2016. Its participation was confirmed by a Commission Decision in March 2017. In September 2017, it was reported that the United Kingdom was planning to hold onto Europol access, such as intelligence sharing and co-operation in fighting crime and terrorism, after Brexit through a new treaty. However, the EU&#x27;s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said in November 2017 that the UK &quot;will no longer be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol&quot; after Brexit takes effect.

=== Activities regarding counter-terrorism ===
The European Parliament approved Europol&#x27;s new legal framework, Regulation (EU) 2016/794, on 11 May 2016 after three years of negotiations and thus repealed the former Decisions of 2009. The new framework granted additional powers on counter-terrorism to Europol, but also includes adding training and exchange programmes for staff, creating a solid data protection system, and strengthening the Parliament&#x27;s control over the Agency. The Regulation took effect on 1 May 2017. Additionally, the full name was amended to European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol).

=== Activities against child sexual abuse ===
Europol started the Stop Child Abuse – Trace an Object campaign and website on 31 May 2017. The site&#x27;s objective is to display objects in child sexual abuse images to try to find the perpetrators and victims — in the hope that distinct details, such as a logo on a bag or a shampoo bottle, can be identified by the public who can then forward the information by an anonymous tip-off or social media. The approach was called crowdsourcing by the investigators. Bellingcat, the investigative search network, reported that several objects had been positively identified following its attempt to support Europol&#x27;s call.

As of May 2024, Europol lead 14 Victim Identification Task Force events which resulted in over 700 children identified and rescued with about 230 offenders arrested.

== Tasks and activities ==
Europol is mandated by the European Union (EU) to assist EU Member States in the fight against international crime, such as illicit drugs, trafficking in human beings, intellectual property crime, cybercrime, euro counterfeiting and terrorism, by serving as a centre for law enforcement co-operation, expertise and criminal intelligence. Europol or its officials do not have executive powers — and therefore they do not have powers of arrest and cannot carry out investigations without the approval of national authorities.

Europol reported it would focus on countering cybercrime, organised crime, and terrorism as well as on building its information technology capacities during the 2016–2020 strategy cycle, . Europol likewise stated that the previous strategy cycle of 2010–2014 laid the foundation for the Agency as the European criminal information hub. The EU Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment (SOCTA) of 2017 identified eight priority crime areas: cybercrime; drug production, trafficking and distribution; migrant smuggling; organised property crime; trafficking in human beings; criminal finances and money laundering; document fraud; and online trade in illicit goods and services.

Additionally, the Agency&#x27;s tasked activities in detail include analysis and exchange information, such as criminal intelligence; co-ordination of investigative and operational action as well as joint investigation teams; preparation of threat assessments, strategic and operational analyses and general situation reports; and developing specialist knowledge of crime prevention and forensic methods. Europol is to coordinate and support other EU bodies established within the area of freedom, security and justice, such as the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and EU crisis management missions. The Agency is also directed to assist the European Council and the European Commission in developing strategic and operational priorities.

In 2016 it co-founded the No More Ransom project.

===Publications===
Europol has published the annual &quot;Terrorism Situation and Trend Report&quot; (TE-SAT) since 2007. This report provides an overview of terrorism within the EU over the previous year. It includes statistics on foiled, failed and completed terrorist attacks, arrests, and the number of deaths and injuries caused by terrorism within the 13 member states.

===European Financial and Economic Crime Centre ===

On 4 May 2020, Europol launched the new European Financial and Economic Crime Centre (EFECC). The Centre aims to enhance the operational support provided to the EU Member States and EU bodies in the fields of financial and economic crime and promote the systematic use of financial investigations.

On 2 December 2020, Europol initiated the European Money Mule Action (EMMA) and collaborated with 26 countries in coordinating the EMMA 7 operation. This effort led to the identification of more than 18,000 money mules and resulted in 1,803 arrests. Successfully carrying out anti-money laundering operations like this may serve as a deterrent and convey a strong message about AML compliance to cryptocurrency businesses throughout various states.

The new EFECC has been set up within the current organisational structure of Europol that is already playing an important part in the European response to financial and economic crime and will be staffed with 65 international experts and analysts.

== Organisation ==
In the financial year 2017, the Agency&#x27;s budget was approximately 116.4 million euros. As of December 2016, Europol has 1065 staff, of which 32.3% are female and 67.7% male, including employment contracts with Europol, liaison officers from Member States and third states and organisations, Seconded National Experts, trainees and contractors. Of the staff, 201 are liaison officers and around 100 analysts. In addition to the Management Board and Liaison Bureaux, Europol is organised into three different departments under the Executive Director:
* 
** O1 Front Office
** O2 European Serious and Organised Crime Centre (ESOCC)
** O3 European Cybercrime Centre (EC3)
** O4 European Counter Terrorism Centre (ECTC)
** O5 Horizontal Operational Services (HOS)
** G1 Corporate Affairs Bureau (CAB)
** G2 Corporate Services
** G3 Procurement
** G5 Security
** C1 ICT
** C5 Administration
==Governance, accountability and relations==
The Europol Directorate&quot;,&quot; the day-to-day leadership of the Agency, is appointed by the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council (JHA) for four-year terms. As of 2018, the agency is headed by executive director Catherine De Bolle. The Agency is accountable to and controlled by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. Together with the European Parliament, the Council approves Europol&#x27;s budget and regulations related to its work. The Council forwards an annual special report to the European Parliament on the work of the Agency — and the Parliament also discharges Europol from its responsibility for managing a set budget. Before 2009, the Agency was an international body and thus the European Parliament lacked effective scrutiny powers over it. From 2009 to 2017, the European Parliament had been the sole organ in parliamentary control of Europol. The Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group (JPSG) was created at the EU Speakers Conference in Bratislava on 23–25 April 2017 to allow both the European Parliament and national EU parliaments to exert control over Europol.

The Europol Management Board comprises representatives from all of the Member States and from the European Commission, each having one vote. Decisions of the Board require a supermajority and it meets at least twice per year on Europol&#x27;s current and future activities as well as on adopting the budget, programming material and general annual reports. The board forwards its decisions to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for perusal. The Management Board functions include data protection, internal audit and accountancy.

External financial oversight of the Agency is conducted by the European Court of Auditors (ECA); for example, ECA evaluated Europol in 2017 on anti-radicalisation programmes. Internal control is carried out by the Internal Audit Service of the European Commission as well as by the Europol Management Board-appointed Internal Audit Function. The European Ombudsman is tasked with investigating complaints against EU institutions and bodies, including Europol, as well as assisting to create a more transparent, effective, accountable and ethical administration. , the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has been responsible for supervising the agency&#x27;s data protection measures.

The Director of Europol is able to enter into agreements for Europol with other countries and international organizations. As of September 2017, Europol co-operates on an operational basis with Albania, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Denmark, Colombia, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Ukraine, United States, and Interpol. Similarly, the Agency has strategic agreements with Armenia, Brazil, China, Russia, Turkey, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and World Customs Organization (WCO).

<text>Samuel Timothy McGraw (born May 1, 1967) is an American country singer and actor. He has released 16 studio albums (11 for Curb Records, five for Big Machine Records and one for Arista Nashville). 10 of those albums have reached number one on the Top Country Albums charts, with his 1994 breakthrough album &quot;Not a Moment Too Soon&quot; being the top country album of 1994. In total, McGraw&#x27;s albums have produced 65 singles, 25 of which have reached number one on the Hot Country Songs or Country Airplay charts.

Three of these singles – &quot;It&#x27;s Your Love&quot;, &quot;Just to See You Smile&quot;, and &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; – were respectively the top country songs of 1997, 1998, and 2004 according to &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End. He has also won three Grammy Awards, 14 Academy of Country Music awards, 11 Country Music Association (CMA) awards, 10 American Music Awards, and three People&#x27;s Choice Awards. His Soul2Soul II Tour, which was done in partnership with his wife, Faith Hill, is one of the highest-grossing tours in country music history, and one of the top five among all genres of music. He has sold more than 80 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

McGraw has ventured into acting, with supporting roles in &quot;The Blind Side&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;, &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Tomorrowland&quot;, &quot;Four Christmases&quot;, flashback scenes in 2 episodes of &quot;Yellowstone&quot;, and &quot;The Shack&quot; as well as lead roles in &quot;Flicka&quot; (2006), &quot;Country Strong&quot; (2010), and &quot;1883&quot; (2021). He was a minority owner of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Nashville Kats. McGraw has been married to singer Faith Hill since 1996 and is the eldest son of former MLB pitcher Tug McGraw.

==Early life and education==
Samuel Timothy McGraw was born in Delhi, Louisiana, the only child of Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Ann D&#x27;Agostino, a waitress from Jacksonville, Florida, and Frank Edwin &quot;Tug&quot; McGraw Jr., a pitcher for the minor league Jacksonville Suns and future star pitcher for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies. In 1966, D&#x27;Agostino was a student at Terry Parker High School. She lived in the same apartment building as Tug McGraw, who was playing baseball for Jacksonville. When she became pregnant with McGraw as a teen, D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s parents sent her to Louisiana to live with relatives. Through his father, McGraw has two half-brothers, Mark and Matthew, and a half-sister named Cari. He also has two younger half-sisters, Tracey and Sandra, through his mother&#x27;s marriage to Horace Smith.
McGraw grew up believing Smith was his father, and used this stepfather&#x27;s surname until meeting Tug. At age 11, McGraw discovered his birth certificate while searching in his mother&#x27;s closet to look for a picture for a school project. Following the discovery, he learned from her who his biological father was and she took him to meet the elder McGraw for the first time. Tug McGraw denied the parentage for seven years until Tim was 18 years old. After that time, the two formed a relationship and remained close until the former baseball star died in 2004.

As a child, McGraw played competitive sports, including baseball, even before the knowledge of who his father was and his professional baseball career. McGraw was also a member of the FFA in high school. Following high school graduation, he attended Northeast Louisiana University on a baseball scholarship, where he was a pre-law major and pledged as a member of Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. A knee injury sustained while playing baseball for the college prevented him from pursuing a professional career in sports.

While in college, McGraw learned to play guitar and would frequently perform and sing for money. He has claimed his roommates often hid the guitar because he was so bad. McGraw followed his mother when she returned to Jacksonville, Florida, in 1987. After the move, he attended Florida Community College at Jacksonville for one term, and occasionally sat in with local bands. In 1989, on the day his hero Keith Whitley died, McGraw dropped out of college to head to Nashville and pursue a musical career.

==Music career==
===1990s===
====&quot;Tim McGraw&quot;====

McGraw came to the attention of Curb Records in 1990. After cutting a demo single, McGraw gave a copy to his father. A man who was friends with Curb Records executives heard the demo while driving with Tug one day and recommended that Curb contact the young singer. Several weeks later, he was able to play his tape for Curb executives, after which they signed him to a recording contract. McGraw made his debut with the single &quot;What Room Was the Holiday In&quot;, which was released on March 29, 1991, and did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart upon its release. In a 2001 retrospective on McGraw&#x27;s career in &quot;Billboard&quot;, a former program director for Nashville station WSM-FM said that he added the song to the station&#x27;s playlist because it showed &quot;undeniable promise&quot;, while another former program director at WXTU in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, recalled that McGraw&#x27;s debut single was &quot;terrible&quot; but that he booked the singer to make an appearance at the station due to his father&#x27;s fame.

Two years later in April 1993, McGraw released his debut album &quot;Tim McGraw&quot;, which was commercially unsuccessful and did not sell well. This is his only studio album not to achieve a music recording sales certification or to enter the Top Country Albums charts. Three more singles were released from &quot;Tim McGraw&quot;: &quot;Welcome to the Club&quot;, &quot;Memory Lane&quot;, and &quot;Two Steppin&#x27; Mind&quot;. None made country Top 40 and the album itself did not chart. Both &quot;Memory Lane&quot; and &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot;, another cut from the album, were co-written by Joe Diffie. &quot;Memory Lane&quot; had originally appeared on Keith Palmer&#x27;s self-titled 1991 debut album.

====&quot;Not a Moment Too Soon&quot;====
McGraw&#x27;s second album, entitled &quot;Not a Moment Too Soon&quot;, was much more successful than his self-titled debut, and it was the best-selling country album of 1994. Its first single, &quot;Indian Outlaw&quot;, sparked controversy, as critics argued that it presented Native Americans in a patronizing way. Some radio stations even chose not to play it. However, the controversy helped spur sales, and the song became McGraw&#x27;s first Top 10 entry on the U.S. country charts after getting as high as number 8. The song also peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take the Girl&quot;, became McGraw&#x27;s first number one on the U.S. country charts, in addition to peaking at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song also &quot;helped cement his image as a ruggedly good-looking guy with a sensitive side.&quot; By year&#x27;s end, the third single from the album, &quot;Down on the Farm&quot; peaked at number 2; after that, the album&#x27;s fourth single, also its title track, became the singer&#x27;s second number one song in early 1995. The fifth and final single &quot;Refried Dreams&quot; reached number 5. The album sold over 6 million copies, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Album charts. On the strength of this success, McGraw won Academy of Country Music awards for Album of the Year and Top New Male Vocalist in 1994. &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Not a Moment Too Soon&quot; as the top country album of 1994 on Billboard Year-End.

====&quot;All I Want&quot;====
McGraw&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;All I Want&quot;, was released in 1995. Just like its predecessor, this album debuted at No. 1 on the country charts. The album even sold over 2 million copies in the United States and reached the Top 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Like It, I Love It&quot;, became McGraw&#x27;s third number one on the American country charts and it also peaked at number 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This song also eventually became the goal song for the Nashville Predators once they began their inaugural season and since then has been left unchanged. The album&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Really Gone&quot; and &quot;All I Want Is a Life&quot; (its partial title track) both made the top 5 at numbers 2 and 5, respectively. The fourth single, &quot;She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart&quot;, gave McGraw his fourth number one on the U.S. country charts in 1996. Finishing off the singles was &quot;Maybe We Should Just Sleep on It&quot;, which peaked at number 4.

In 1996, McGraw headlined the most successful country tour of the year, The Spontaneous Combustion Tour, with Faith Hill as his supporting act. Hill broke off her engagement to her former producer Scott Hendricks so that she and McGraw could start dating each other; they then married on October 6, 1996.

====&quot;Everywhere&quot;====
The singer&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Everywhere&quot; was released in 1997. It topped the country charts as well and reached No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 4 million copies. The album spawned six singles. Four of those singles - &quot;It&#x27;s Your Love&quot; (a duet with Faith Hill), the title track, &quot;Where the Green Grass Grows&quot;, and &quot;Just to See You Smile&quot; - reached number one on the country charts. The Country Music Association awarded &quot;Everywhere&quot; its Album of the Year award for 1997. At the 40th Grammy Awards, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Love&quot; received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Country Collaboration With Vocals and Best Country Song. Both &quot;It&#x27;s Your Love&quot; and &quot;Just to See You Smile&quot; were the number one country songs of 1997 and 1998 according to &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End charts; &quot;Just to See You Smile&quot; also set a record for the longest run on the country charts at the time, at 42 weeks. The album&#x27;s other two singles, &quot;One of These Days&quot; and &quot;For a Little While&quot; both peaked at number 2.

====&quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;====
McGraw&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot;, continued his streak in 1999, debuting atop both the US country and pop album charts and selling 3 million copies. Over 251,000 of those copies were sold during its first week, making this the singer&#x27;s first number 1 opener on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It produced another four number one hits on the U.S. country charts with &quot;Please Remember Me&quot;, &quot;Something Like That&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend&quot;, and &quot;My Next Thirty Years&quot;. &quot;Some Things Never Change&quot; peaked at number 7 on the charts. McGraw also contributed a song for the Grammy-winning tribute album to Bob Wills entitled &quot;Ride With Bob&quot;. A cover of &quot;Milk Cow Blues&quot;, this song was recorded as a duet with Asleep at the Wheel, whom he had met while performing together at the George Strait Country Music Festival.

McGraw recorded two more duets with his wife in the late-1990s, both of which appeared on her albums. &quot;Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me&quot;, from her multi-platinum-certified 1998 album &quot;Faith&quot;, reached the Top 5 of the US country charts. Her follow-up album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot;, featured &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Collaboration in 2000.

===2000s===
====&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;====
In 2000, McGraw released his first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, which topped the country albums charts for nine weeks and sold nearly 6 million copies, making this one of the biggest-selling albums in the modern country market. In the latter half of the year, he and Hill went out on the Soul2Soul Tour, playing to sellout crowds in 64 venues, including Madison Square Garden. The tour was one of the top tours of any genre in the U.S. It was also the leading country tour of 2000. While in Buffalo, New York, McGraw and Kenny Chesney became involved in a scuffle with police officers after Chesney attempted to ride a police horse. McGraw came to Chesney&#x27;s aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen and tried to arrest him. The two were arrested and charged with assault but were later cleared. During a concert with the George Strait Country Music Festival several weeks later, Hill, dressed as a police officer, made an unscheduled appearance at the end of McGraw&#x27;s set and led him off the stage.

====&quot;Set This Circus Down&quot;====
McGraw&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Set This Circus Down&quot;, was released in April 2001. It even spawned four number one hits on the country charts as well, this time with &quot;Grown Men Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, &quot;Angry All the Time&quot; (with Faith Hill), &quot;The Cowboy in Me&quot;, and &quot;Unbroken&quot;. The singer provided harmony vocals for Jo Dee Messina&#x27;s song &quot;Bring On the Rain&quot;, which he also produced. That song topped the country charts. Hungry for more of his music, fans downloaded a version of his performance of the song &quot;Things Change&quot; from his appearance at the Country Music Association Awards Show. The song was played extensively on radio, becoming the first country song to appear on the charts from a fully downloaded version.

====&quot;Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors&quot;====
In 2002, McGraw bucked country music traditions by recording his seventh studio album &quot;Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors&quot; with his tour band The Dancehall Doctors. Unlike rock music—where it is commonplace for touring bands to provide the music on albums recorded by the artist they support, country albums are typically recorded with session musicians. McGraw chose to use his own touring band, in order to recognize their part in 
his success, and to capture some of the feel of a real band.

All of the Dancehall Doctors have worked with McGraw since at least 1996. Their lineup includes:
* Darran Smith – lead guitar, acoustic guitar
* Bob Minner – rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, banjo, mandolin
* Denny Hemingson – steel guitar, electric, baritone, and slide guitars, dobro
* John Marcus – bass guitar
* Dean Brown – fiddle, mandolin
* Jeff McMahon – piano, organ, synthesizer, keyboards ... etc.
* Billy Mason – drums
* David Dunkley – percussion

The album debuted at No. 2 on the country albums charts, Its fourth and fifth singles &quot;Real Good Man&quot; and &quot;Watch the Wind Blow By&quot; both climbed to number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. &quot;She&#x27;s My Kind of Rain&quot; peaked at No. 2 in 2003, and &quot;Red Rag Top&quot; reached number 5. The album also features a cover of Elton John&#x27;s early-1970s classic &quot;Tiny Dancer,&quot; as well as duets with Kim Carnes on &quot;Comfort Me&quot; (a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks) and Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit of the Eagles on &quot;Illegal.&quot; &quot;She&#x27;s My Kind of Rain&quot; also received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance-Male at the 46th Grammy Awards.

====&quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot;====
His eighth album, 2004&#x27;s &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot;, continued the singer&#x27;s record of commercial success. The album&#x27;s first single and its title track was dedicated to his father Tug McGraw, who died of a brain tumor earlier in the year, was an ode to living life fully and in the moment. The second single &quot;Back When&quot; was a paean to an easy nostalgia. In December 2019, McGraw spoke on stage at the annual End Well Symposium about why he wrote &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; and his struggles with caregiving for his dying father. &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; spent seven non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot; and went on to become the top country song of 2004 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End charts. It also became one of the most awarded records by winning ACM Single and Song of the Year, CMA Single and Song of the Year, and a Grammy. &quot;Back When&quot; went to number one on the country charts as well. The album produced three more singles with &quot;Drugs or Jesus&quot;, &quot;Do You Want Fries with That&quot;, and &quot;My Old Friend&quot;. &quot;Drugs or Jesus&quot; became McGraw&#x27;s first single since 1993 to not ever reach within the Top 10 on the U.S. country charts, while &quot;Do You Want Fries with That&quot; and &quot;My Old Friend&quot; peaked at numbers 5 and 6, respectively.

In late 2004, his unlikely duet with hip hop artist Nelly on &quot;Over and Over&quot; became a crossover hit, spending 10 weeks atop the top 40 chart. &quot;Over and Over&quot; brought McGraw a success he had never previously experienced on contemporary hit radio or R&amp;B radio, and brought both artists success neither had previously experienced in the hot adult contemporary market. The song also spent a week at the top of the charts in the United Kingdom, becoming McGraw&#x27;s first hit single in Britain and Nelly&#x27;s third number one hit in the country after &quot;Dilemma&quot; and &quot;My Place&quot;. &quot;Over and Over&quot; also reached the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland, and the top 10 in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Romania, and Switzerland.

Throughout the 2005 NFL season, McGraw sang an alternate version of &quot;I Like It, I Love It&quot; every week during the season. The alternate lyrics, which changed each week, would make reference to plays during Sunday&#x27;s games, and the song would be played alongside video highlights during halftime on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. Later in the year, McGraw became a minority owner of the Arena Football League&#x27;s Nashville Kats when majority owner Bud Adams (owner of the NFL&#x27;s Tennessee Titans) was awarded the expansion franchise.

====&quot;Let It Go&quot;====

In April 2006, McGraw and Hill began their 73-concert 55-city Soul2Soul II Tour, again to strong commercial acceptance. The tour grossed roughly $89 million and sold approximately 1.1 million tickets, making it the top-grossing tour in the history of country music. It was also named &quot;Major Tour of the Year&quot; by &quot;Pollstar&quot;, beating out such heavyweights as Madonna and the Rolling Stones. In a special gesture, the couple donated all of the profits from their performance in New Orleans to Hurricane Katrina relief. McGraw, along with Kenny Chesney, contributed to a version of Tracy Lawrence&#x27;s song &quot;Find Out Who Your Friends Are&quot;, which can be found on Lawrence&#x27;s album &quot;For the Love&quot;. Although the official single version features only Lawrence&#x27;s vocals, many stations have opted to play the version with McGraw and Chesney instead.

McGraw released his eleventh studio album, &quot;Let It Go&quot;, on March 27, 2007. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Last Dollar (Fly Away)&quot;, peaked at number one on the Hot Country Songs chart. This marked McGraw&#x27;s first No. 1 single since &quot;Back When&quot; in late 2004. The album debuted at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and Top Country Album charts, marking his fourth No. 1 album on the 200 charts and his ninth overall. His daughters can be heard singing the chorus during the last few seconds of the song on the video. During the Academy of Country Music awards show on May 15, 2007, McGraw performed a song titled &quot;If You&#x27;re Reading This&quot;, which he co-wrote with The Warren Brothers. Several radio stations began to play the live recording of the song; as a result, it entered the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart at No. 35. McGraw also produced the debut album of country music duo Halfway to Hazard. The duo&#x27;s first single, &quot;Daisy&quot;, peaked at No. 39 on the country charts in the summer of 2007. In the summer of 2007, McGraw and Hill toured together once again in the Soul2Soul 2007 tour.

In the edition of January 18, 2008 of the &quot;USA Today&quot; newspaper, McGraw was stated to be featured on the Def Leppard album &quot;Songs from the Sparkle Lounge&quot;, having also co-written the first single, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, with Def Leppard band members Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage. The unusual pairing goes back to 2006 when McGraw joined Def Leppard onstage for the song &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, and then collaborated on the song &quot;Nine Lives&quot; afterward. The album was released on April 25, 2008. At the 2007 50th Annual Grammy Awards, McGraw received 5 nominations including Best Country Album (for &quot;Let It Go&quot;), Best Country Song (both for &quot;If You&#x27;re Reading This&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot;), Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (with &quot;I Need You&quot;), and Best Male Country Vocal Performance (with &quot;If You&#x27;re Reading This&quot;). In May 2008, he hit the road with the Live Your Voice tour. The mainly-outdoor arena concert tour was his first solo outing in nearly three years. Also in May 2008, he debuted a new song in his follow-up to &quot;Let It Go&quot; at the Stagecoach Music Festival in Indio, California. In July 2008, the album&#x27;s sixth single and its title track, &quot;Let It Go&quot;, was released to country radio. Following that, a seventh single, &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Die For&quot;, entered the Country charts at No. 57 in late December. McGraw released his third greatest-hits package, &quot;Greatest Hits 3&quot; on October 7, 2008. The album features 12 tracks. McGraw was set to debut a new song at the 2009 ACM Awards, but then canceled his performance; he was replaced by Blake Shelton, who sang &quot;She Wouldn&#x27;t Be Gone&quot;.

====&quot;Southern Voice&quot;====
McGraw&#x27;s twelfth studio album, &quot;Southern Voice&quot;, was released October 20, 2009, and led by the single &quot;It&#x27;s A Business Doing Pleasure With You&quot;, which was shipped to radio outlets in late June 2009.
&quot;Southern Voice&quot; was argued to be McGraw&#x27;s last album for Curb Records, following the dispute over releasing his third Greatest Hits collection back in October 2008 without his permission. McGraw did not approve of the release. On November 30, 2010, Curb Records released his fourth greatest hits compilation, &quot;Number One Hits&quot;.

===2010s===
====&quot;Emotional Traffic&quot; and Curb Records lawsuit====
On January 2, 2011, McGraw announced plans for his Emotional Traffic Tour featuring opening acts Luke Bryan and The Band Perry.
Sirius XM announced on March 30, 2011, that they would be launching Tim McGraw radio, a commercial-free music channel devoted to McGraw&#x27;s music, and featuring an in-depth interview with McGraw as well. As of fall 2010, McGraw had finished work on the album &quot;Emotional Traffic&quot;, his last album with Curb Records. On May 13, 2011, Curb Records filed a breach-of-contract suit against McGraw. The label alleged that McGraw recorded tracks for his &quot;Emotional Traffic&quot; album too early prior to its delivery to the label. Several days later, McGraw filed a counter suit against the label seeking advance payment and recording-fund reimbursement, unspecified damages, and a jury trial. A trial was scheduled to begin in July 2012. In November 2011, a judge granted McGraw permission to record music for another label, ending his relationship with Curb Records that began in 1990. A few hours after the ruling, Curb released &quot;Better Than I Used to Be&quot;, the first single from &quot;Emotional Traffic&quot;. The album was released on January 24, 2012.

====&quot;Two Lanes of Freedom&quot;====
In December 2011, McGraw released his first Christmas single, &quot;Christmas All Over the World&quot;, on his own label StyleSonic Records. On May 21, 2012, however, he signed with Big Machine Records.

The tour began on April 7, 2017, in New Orleans and will continue into 2018, incorporating the C2C: Country to Country festival held in the UK and Ireland throughout March 2018.

Before the commencement of the tour, it was reported that McGraw, alongside Hill, had signed a new deal with Sony Music Nashville. The signing also indicated the release of a duet album between the couple, and that multiple solo recordings would be produced. The new record label signing also preceded the release of &quot;Speak to a Girl&quot;, the lead single from the duet album, &quot;The Rest of Our Life&quot;, which was released on November 17, 2017. The release of the album coincided with the opening of an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum titled &quot;Mississippi Woman, Louisiana Man&quot;, which celebrates the careers of both McGraw and Hill.

In February 2020, McGraw rejoined Big Machine Records, which he was previously signed to from 2011 to 2017. He released a new album, &quot;Here on Earth&quot;, on August 21, 2020. The &quot;Here on Earth Tour&quot; was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2021, McGraw released the single &quot;Undivided&quot; with Tyler Hubbard of Florida Georgia Line, which was included on a deluxe edition of &quot;Here on Earth&quot; released later that year. On October 9, 2021, McGraw confronted a heckler at a performance at the Nugget Events Center in Sparks, Nevada, after he forgot the words to his song &quot;Just to See You Smile.&quot; After removing the heckler, he explained that he had been filming a movie and had a lot on his mind, and asked for the audience&#x27;s help in remembering the words.

====&quot;Standing Room Only&quot; and &quot;Poet&#x27;s Resumé&quot;====
On August 25, 2023, McGraw released his sixteenth studio album, &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;. The title track was released as the album&#x27;s lead single on March 10, 2023.

Three months after releasing &quot;Standing Room Only&quot;, McGraw surprise-released a six-track EP, &quot;Poet&#x27;s Resumé&quot; on November 21, 2023.

==Production career==

McGraw has occasionally served as a record producer in collaboration with Byron Gallimore, who has co-produced all of his albums. The two co-produced Jo Dee Messina&#x27;s self-titled debut, as well as her next two albums, &quot;I&#x27;m Alright&quot; and &quot;Burn&quot;. McGraw and Gallimore also produced the only album released by The Clark Family Experience in 2000, and Halfway to Hazard&#x27;s 2007 self-titled debut album.

==Acting career==
McGraw&#x27;s first acting appearance came in a 1997 episode of &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot;, where he played Foxworthy&#x27;s rival. In 2004, McGraw played a sheriff in Rick Schroder&#x27;s independent release &quot;Black Cloud&quot;. Later in the same year, McGraw received critical acclaim as the overbearing father of running back &quot;Donald Billingsley&quot; in the major studio Texas high school football drama &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. The &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; said the role was &quot;played with unexpected ferocity by country singer Tim McGraw&quot;. The movie went on to gross over $60 million worldwide at the box office, and sold millions in the DVD market. Most recently, it was named one of the Top 50 High School Movies of All Time (No. 37) by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

McGraw&#x27;s first lead role was in the 2006 film &quot;Flicka&quot;, which was released in theaters October 20, 2006. In the remake of the classic book &quot;My Friend Flicka&quot;, McGraw played the father, Rob, costarring with Alison Lohman and Maria Bello. The family-friendly movie debuted in the top 10 list and has grossed over $25 million at the box office. McGraw again achieved critical acclaim for his acting. Shortly before &quot;Flicka&quot; opened, McGraw received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His star is located at 6901 Hollywood Boulevard near stars honoring Julie Andrews, William Shatner, and the late Greta Garbo. One of his &quot;Flicka&quot; co-stars, Alison Lohman, attended the ceremony that included comments from Billy Bob Thornton, McGraw&#x27;s co-star in the film &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. In addition to acting in &quot;Flicka&quot;, McGraw served as executive producer of the soundtrack album, which was released by his record label, StyleSonic Records, in association with Curb Records and Fox 2000 films. It featured the closing credit song &quot;My Little Girl&quot;, one of the first two songs that McGraw recorded that he also co-wrote (the other being &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Friends That Do&quot;, both of which were included on &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 2&quot;). The song was nominated by the Broadcast Film Critics for &quot;Best Song&quot; in a film, and the movie was nominated in the category &quot;Best Family Film (Live Action)&quot;. The movie proved to be another success in the DVD market, and has sold over a million copies, debuting at No. 3 on the DVD sales chart.

McGraw also had a small part in the Michael Mann–produced 2007 film &quot;The Kingdom&quot;, reuniting him with &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; director Peter Berg. McGraw played a bitter, angered widower whose wife was killed in the terrorist attack that is the centerpiece of the movie. On November 22, 2008, McGraw made his first appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He also played &quot;Dallas McVie&quot; in &quot;Four Christmases&quot;. McGraw appeared in the 2009 film &quot;The Blind Side&quot; as Sean Tuohy, husband of Sandra Bullock&#x27;s character, Leigh Anne Tuohy. &quot;The Blind Side&quot; is based on the true story of Michael Oher, a homeless African-American youngster from a broken home, taken in and adopted by the Tuohys, a well-to-do white family who help him fulfill his potential. He is among the stars of &quot;Dirty Girl&quot;, a film that premiered on September 12, 2010, at the Toronto Film Festival, along with Juno Temple, Milla Jovovich, William H. Macy and Dwight Yoakam. Also in 2010, McGraw starred in &quot;Country Strong&quot; as James Canter, the husband and manager of the fictional country singer Kelly Canter (portrayed by Gwyneth Paltrow). In addition to his appearance in the film, McGraw&#x27;s song &quot;Me and Tennessee&quot;, a duet with Paltrow, was played during the closing credits and appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. In 2015, McGraw appeared in Brad Bird&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; as Eddie Newton, a NASA engineer, and Casey Newton&#x27;s (played by Britt Robertson) father.

&quot;1883&quot;, a spinoff prequel to Taylor Sheridan&#x27;s Yellowstone television series was released in late 2021 and stars McGraw, Faith Hill, and Sam Elliott.

==Charitable efforts==
In 1994, when McGraw first reached fame, he established the annual Swampstock event. It began as a charity softball game to raise money for hometown little league programs; the event now includes a celebrity softball game and a multi-artist concert that attracts over 11,000 fans per year. The combined events have funded new Little League parks and equipment, and have established college scholarship funds for students in the northeast Louisiana area.

From 1996 to 1999, McGraw hosted an annual New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in Nashville with special guests including Jeff Foxworthy, the Dixie Chicks, and Martina McBride. The 1997 show raised over $100,000 for the Country Music Foundation Hall of Fame and Museum. Beginning in 1999, McGraw would pick select cities on each tour, and the night before he was scheduled to perform, would choose a local club and host a quickly-organized show. This tour-within-a-tour became known as &quot;The Bread and Water Tour&quot;, and all proceeds from the show would go to a charity from that community.

McGraw designed a charity T-shirt sold through Angelwear to benefit MusiCares. MusiCares supports musicians in times of need. His charity focuses particularly on health issues. The Tim McGraw Foundation raises funds to enhance the quality of life of children and adults with brain tumors. He supports the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center, the David Foster Foundation, which helps families of children in need of organ transplants, and Musicians on Call, which brings music to hospital patients&#x27; bedsides. He also performs during dinners and auctions to benefit children with disabilities. Hill and McGraw gave the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society $375,000 (the entire gate receipts from one of their concerts) to assist the families of 17 sailors following the terrorist attack on , the guided-missile destroyer that suffered significant damage in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen on October 12, 2000.

In the days immediately following Hurricane Katrina, McGraw who was raised in Mississippi, joined groups taking supplies to Gulfport, Mississippi. The two also hosted several charity concerts to benefit those who were displaced by the storm. Later in the year, the couple established the Neighbor&#x27;s Keeper Foundation, which provides funding for community charities to assist with basic humanitarian services, in the event of a natural disaster, or for desperate personal circumstances.

McGraw is also a member of the American Red Cross National Celebrity Cabinet, to which various celebrities donate their time, skills, and fame, to help the Red Cross highlight important initiatives and response efforts.

McGraw has helped out with charity events held by Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. The Brett Favre Fourward Foundation has featured McGraw performing concerts during dinners and auctions that benefit children with disabilities in Wisconsin and Mississippi. One instance is recorded on Favre&#x27;s official website.

On July 12, 2007, it was made public that McGraw while in Grand Rapids, Michigan for a performance, donated $5,000 to Kailey Kozminski, the 3-year-old daughter of Officer Robert Kozminski, a Grand Rapids police officer who was killed on July 8, 2007, while responding to a domestic disturbance.

In April 2023, McGraw surprised rising country star Brandon Davis, whom he previously brought on tour with him in 2022, with a new guitar after all of his gear was stolen earlier in the month.

==Personal politics==

In a 2006 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, McGraw stated he would like to run for public office as a Democratic Party candidate, possibly for United States Senate or Governor of Tennessee—his home state. In the same interview, he praised Bill Clinton.

In a 2008 interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine, McGraw referred to himself as a &quot;Blue Dog Democrat&quot; and stated that he and his family support Barack Obama.

In January 2021, McGraw performed on the &quot;Celebrating America&quot; inaugural special, a primetime virtual concert celebrating the inauguration of Joe Biden.

==Personal life==
McGraw married fellow country singer Faith Hill in 1996, and they have three daughters. He and Hill own Goat Cay, which they unofficially named L&#x27;île d&#x27;Anges, a private island in the Bahamas.

In 2000, Kenny Chesney and McGraw became involved in a scuffle with police officers in Buffalo, New York, after Chesney was riding a State Police horse and refused to get off the horse. McGraw came to Chesney&#x27;s aid after police officers nearby believed the horse was being stolen. The two were arrested and charged, Chesney for disorderly conduct and McGraw for assault, but were acquitted in 2001.

McGraw holds a private pilot license and owns a single-engine Cirrus SR22.

In 2015, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated McGraw&#x27;s annual income at $38 million.

McGraw is the godfather to the son of Garrett Hedlund and Emma Roberts. He and Hedlund became friends after co-starring in &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; and &quot;Country Strong&quot;.

In acknowledgment of his grandfather&#x27;s Italian heritage, McGraw was honored by the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) in 2004, receiving the NIAF Special Achievement Award in Music during the Foundation&#x27;s 29th Anniversary Gala.

McGraw&#x27;s Bracco Italiano named Lepshi won Best of Breed at the 2023 Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The McGraw-Hill family also has two other Bracco Italianos, Caesar and Stromboli.

<text>An inkometer is a specialized measuring instrument used by the printing industry to measure the &quot;tack&quot; (adhesiveness) of an ink with the roller system on an offset press. The importance of tack is that it is not so excessive that it doesn&#x27;t allow effective transfer from the rollers to the plate and then to the blanket and onto the substrate being printed. Inks can also be tack &quot;graded&quot; in descending sequence to allow for better trapping of one color over another. Inks with too much tack can cause the surface of the paper to pick off and interfere with transfer on subsequent printing units and copies.

The amount of tack can be controlled by changing the amount of solvent or other diluent used in the ink. The inkometer is made up of three rollers. The center roller is a temperature controlled brass roller, the bottom roller is an oscillating rubber distribution roller. The top roller is attached to a load cell which measures the tack at a given press speed (i.e. 800 feet per minute for a web press or 15000 sheets per hour for an offset press)

<text>The All-America City Award is a community recognition program in the United States given by the National Civic League. The award recognizes the work of communities in using inclusive civic engagement to address critical issues and create stronger connections among residents, businesses and nonprofit and government leaders. Once called by the organization the &quot;Nobel Prize for Constructive Citizenship,&quot; it has been awarded to more than 500 communities across the country. The award is open to all American communities ranging from major cities and regions to towns, villages, counties, neighborhoods and tribes.

Since the program&#x27;s inception in 1949, more than 500 communities have been named &quot;All-America Cities&quot;. Each year, interested communities submit a comprehensive package based on published criteria that are evaluated in the award selection process. Deserving communities are named as finalists, and the year&#x27;s ten award winners are named from that pool of applicants. Representatives from the finalist communities then travel to Denver to present the story of their work and their community to a jury of national experts. The awards conference includes workshops on promising practices.

<doc id="525358" wikidata="Q3505882" url="?curid=525358" title="Five Ks">
<text>In Sikhism, the Five Ks (, , ) are five items that Guru Gobind Singh, in 1699, commanded Khalsa Sikhs to wear at all times. They are: &quot;kesh&quot; (, , unshorn hair and beard since the Sikh decided to keep it), &quot;kangha (&quot;, , a comb for the kesh, usually wood), &quot;kara&quot; (, , a bracelet, usually made of iron or steel), &quot;kachhera&quot; (, , an undergarment), and &quot;kirpan (&quot;, , a small curved sword or knife made of iron or steel).

The Five Ks are not just symbols, but articles of faith that collectively form the external identity and the Khalsa devotee&#x27;s commitment to the &quot;Sikh rehni,&quot; &#x27;Sikh way of life&#x27;. A Sikh who has taken Amrit and keeps all five Ks is known as &quot;Khalsa&quot; (&#x27;pure&#x27;) or &quot;Amritdhari Sikh&quot; (&#x27;Amrit Sanskar participant&#x27;), a Sikh who has not taken Amrit but follows the teachings of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib is called a &quot;Sahajdhari Sikh&quot;.

==&quot;Kesh&quot;==
The &quot;kesh,&quot; also known as &quot;kesa&quot;, or uncut, long hair, is considered by Sikhs to be an indispensable part of the human body. It also emulates the appearance of Guru Gobind Singh and is one of the primary signs by which a Sikh can be clearly and quickly identified. A Sikh never cuts or trims any hair as a symbol of respect for the perfection of God&#x27;s creation. The uncut long hair and the beard, in the case of men, form the main for Sikhs.

The turban is a spiritual crown, which is a constant reminder to the Sikh that they are sitting on the throne of consciousness and are committed to living according to Sikh principles. Guru Gobind Singh told his Sikhs:
&quot;&quot;Khalsa mero roop hai khaas. Khalsa mai ho karo nivaas&quot;... The &quot;Khalsa&quot; is my image. Within the &quot;Khalsa&quot; I reside.&quot; Wearing a turban declares sovereignty, dedication, self-respect, courage and piety.

A noted figure in Sikh history is Bhai Taru Singh, who was martyred when he refused to get his &quot;kesh&quot; cut.

==&quot;Kangha&quot;==

A &quot;kanga&quot; is a medium-sized wooden comb that Sikhs use twice a day. It is supposed to be worn only in the hair and at all times. Combs help to clean and remove tangles from the hair and are a symbol of cleanliness. Combing their hair reminds Sikhs that their lives should be tidy and organized.

The comb keeps the hair tidy, a symbol of not just accepting what God has given, but also an injunction to maintain it with grace. The Guru Granth Sahib said hair should be allowed to grow naturally; this precludes any shaving for both men and women. In the Guru&#x27;s time, some holy men let their hair become tangled and dirty. The Guru said that this was not right; that hair should be allowed to grow but it should be kept clean and combed at least twice a day.

==&quot;Kara&quot;==

The Sikhs were commanded by Guru Gobind Singh at the Baisakhi Amrit Sanchar in 1699 to wear an iron bracelet called a &quot;Kara&quot; at all times. The &quot;kara&quot; is a constant reminder that whatever a person does with their hands has to be in keeping with the advice given by the Guru. The &quot;kara&quot; is an iron/steel circle to symbolize God as never-ending. It is a symbol of permanent bonding to the community, of being a link in the chain of Khalsa Sikhs (the word for link is Ka&quot;ri&quot;).
The kara should be of a cheap metal, such as iron or steel, to show equality and so that nobody can be shown as more important than anybody else with the material of their kara.

==&quot;Kachhera&quot;==



The &quot;Kachhera&quot; is a shalwar-underwear with a tie-knot worn by Baptised Sikhs. Originally, the &quot;Kachhera&quot; was made part of the five Ks as a symbol of a Sikh soldier&#x27;s willingness to be ready at a moment&#x27;s notice for battle or for defense. The confirmed Sikh (one who has taken the &quot;Amrit&quot;) wears a &quot;Kachhera&quot; every day. Some of them go to the extent of wearing a &quot;Kachhera&quot; while bathing, to be ready at a moment&#x27;s notice, changing into the new one a single leg at a time, so as to have no moment where they are unprepared. Further, this garment allowed the Sikh soldier to operate in combat freely and without any hindrance or restriction, because it was easy to fabricate, maintain, wash, and carry compared to other traditional undergarments of that era, like the dhoti. The &quot;Kachhera&quot; symbolizes self-respect, and always reminds the wearer of mental control over lust, one of the Five Evils in Sikh philosophy.

The &quot;Kachhera&quot; follows a generally practical and roomy design. It features an embedded string that circles the waist which can be tightened or loosened as desired and then knotted securely. The &quot;Kachhera&quot; can be classed between underwear and an outer garment, as in appearance it does not reveal private anatomy, and looks and wears like shorts. As with all of the Five Ks, there is equality between men and women, and so women are also expected to wear it. Considering the hot climate in India, the &quot;Kachhera&quot; is often worn by men as an outer garment, keeping the wearer cool and being practical in manual work such as farming, but it is generally not considered respectful for women to wear the &quot;Kacchera&quot; as an outer garment (on its own) as it is considered too revealing.

==&quot;Kirpan&quot;==


The &quot;kirpan&quot; is a dagger that symbolises a Sikh&#x27;s duty to come to the defense of those in peril. All Sikhs should wear the &quot;kirpan&quot; on their body at all times as a defensive side-arm, just as a police officer is expected to wear a side-arm when on duty. Its use is only allowed in the act of self-defense and the protection of others. It stands for bravery and protecting the weak and innocent.

The &quot;kirpan&quot; is kept sharp and is actually used to defend others, such as those who are oppressed by harsh rulers, or a person who is being robbed, raped, or beaten. The true Sikh cannot turn a blind eye to such evils, thinking that they are &quot;someone else&#x27;s concern.&quot; It is the duty of the true Sikh to help those who suffer unjustly, by whatever means available, whether that means alerting the police, summoning help, or defending those who cannot defend themselves, even if that means putting oneself in harm&#x27;s way.

The Five Ks are the bare minimum and are not the full extent of Khalsa uniform; the &quot;Panj Kapde&quot; is also part of Khalsa uniform. It is part of the tradition of &quot;panj kapar&quot;e (five garments), comprising dastaar (turban), &quot;hazooria&quot; (long white scarf worn around the neck), long chola (dress), &quot;kamar-kasaa&quot; (material tied around the waist like a belt) and &quot;kacchera&quot; (under-garment). Reference to this has been made by Varan Bhai Gurdas as well. The &quot;dastaar&quot; and &quot;kachera&quot; are mandatory for Sikhs although more spiritual Sikhs also have the other &quot;kapde&quot;.

=== &quot;Dastaar&quot; ===
A &quot;dastār&quot; (Punjabi: , from Persian: ) which derives from &quot;dast-e-yār&quot; or &#x27;the hand of God&#x27;, is an item of headwear associated with Sikhism, and is an important part of Sikh culture. The word is loaned from Persian through Punjabi. In Persian, the word &quot;dastār&quot; can refer to any kind of turban and replaced the original word for turban, &quot;dolband&quot; (), from which the English word is derived.

Among the Sikhs, the &quot;dastār&quot; is an article of faith that represents equality, honour, self-respect, courage, spirituality, and piety. The Khalsa Sikh men and women, who keep the Five Ks, wear the turban to cover their long, uncut hair (&quot;kesh&quot;). The Sikhs regard the &quot;dastār&quot; as an important part of the unique Sikh identity. After the ninth Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, was sentenced to death by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru created the Khalsa and gave five articles of faith, one of which is unshorn hair, which the &quot;dastār&quot; covers.

=== Sikh &quot;chola&quot; ===
Sikh &quot;chola&quot; is traditional dress worn by Sikhs. It is a martial attire that gives freedom of movement to a Sikh warrior. Sikh &quot;chola&quot; is also unisex attire, and may also be decorated with heavy embroidery all over it. It is meant to be either yellow, white or electric blue with many pockets to hold matchlocks and other weapons.

=== &quot;Kamar kasa&quot; ===
&quot;Kamar kasa&quot; is a sash bound around the waist to hold weapons an essential part of Nihang (Sikh warrior) dress. It is also called &quot;cumberband&quot;, &quot;belt&quot;, &quot;waist sash&quot;, or &quot;waistband&quot;. The Kamar kasa is meant to be yellow if wearing a blue chola or blue if wearing a white chola.

=== &quot;Hazooria&quot; ===

A &quot;hazooria&quot; (scarf) is a sign of humility which is grasped during the Ardās. It is a constant reminder of surrendering one&#x27;s mind to the Guru, along with the five K&#x27;s. A &quot;hazooria&quot; is practical: it helps one keep &quot;suchamta&quot; (cleanliness) during &quot;seva&quot; (service) or reading Gurbani (hymns). It can help keep the hands clean when touching the face or picking up objects. The &quot;hazooria&quot; was also worn by servants and symbolises the Sikh surrendering to Waheguruji as their master.

<text>The Labrador Party (or New Labrador Party) was the name of two political parties in Newfoundland advocating the interests of the region of Labrador, Canada.
==New Labrador Party (1969–1975)==

The party was founded in 1969 by Tom Burgess, a disaffected former Liberal MHA who crossed the floor to become an independent when he was passed over for a cabinet seat. He was re-elected to the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from Labrador West in the 1971 provincial election under the New Labrador Party banner. The election returned a hung parliament. Burgess initially indicated that he would support the opposition Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s bid to form a government and unseat Premier Joey Smallwood&#x27;s Liberals but, days after Conservative leader Frank Moores was sworn in as Premier, Burgess was enticed to rejoin the Liberals under the false promise that he would succeed Joey Smallwood as Liberal leader and Premier. Burgess joined the Liberals on January 31, 1972 but was defeated in the party&#x27;s leadership convention. His defection and that of a Progressive Conservative MHA was enough to bring down the Moores government and force an election; however, Burgess lost his seat and Moores formed a majority Conservative government.

Mike Martin won a seat for the party in a 1972 by-election in Labrador South. However, the MHA retired prior to the 1975 election, and the party was dissolved.





==Second Labrador Party==

Feelings among Labradorians that the region has been neglected by the Newfoundland and Labrador government led to the party&#x27;s refounding in 2003 with Ern Condon as leader. The party nominated candidates in each of Labrador&#x27;s four ridings in that year&#x27;s election, with the hope of holding the balance of power in the House of Assembly and being able to trade political support for more services and attention to Labrador.

The party failed to win any seats, though Brandon Pardy came in second in Lake Melville with 32% of the vote. The party received 12% of the vote in Labrador West, 8% in Cartwright-L&#x27;Anse au Clair, and 5% in Torngat Mountains.

The party chose Ron Barron, the Deputy Mayor of Wabush, as the party leader in preparation for the next provincial election. In a by-election for the riding of Labrador West held on March 13, 2007, Labrador Party candidate Ron Barron came in third, winning 670 of a total of just over 4000 votes cast.

In the fall election in 2007, the Labrador Party decided not to run candidates in three of Labrador&#x27;s four ridings so the vote between parties opposed to the Progressive Conservatives would not get split. Jimmy Tuttauk, the party&#x27;s only candidate, earned almost 8% of the vote in the district of Torngat Mountains.

<text>West Orchard is a small village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It is situated in the Blackmore Vale in the North Dorset administrative district, approximately halfway between the towns of Shaftesbury and Sturminster Newton. It is separated from the adjacent settlement of East Orchard by a stream. In 2013 the civil parish had an estimated population of 50. For local government purposes the parish is grouped with the parishes of East Orchard and Margaret Marsh, to form a Group Parish Council.

St Luke&#x27;s Church was rebuilt in 1876–77 to the designs of Thomas Henry Wyatt, but the chancel is 15th-century.

==Etymology==
The name of West Orchard is first attested in a charter of 939 (surviving in a fifteenth-century copy), in the form &quot;Archet&quot;. The name derives from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;on&quot;) and (&quot;wood&quot;), and thus the name once meant &quot;at the wood&quot;. Its modern form shows assimilation to the English noun &quot;orchard&quot; through folk-etymology. The element &quot;West&quot; was added to the name later when the settlement became distinct from East Orchard.

<text>was a town located in Wake District, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

On March 22, 2005, Hinase, along with the towns of Yoshinaga (also from Wake District), was merged into the expanded city of Bizen.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 8,347 and a density of 232.44 persons per km2. The total area was 35.91 km2.

Hinase is best accessed via train, along the Ako line from Okayama station, on the train terminating at Banshu-Ako. Upon arrival at Hinase station, visitors are greeted by the sight of a bay with a huge hill on the other side. Upon the side of the hill is pruned the word Hinase in Hiragana text (ひなせ). At night, this large sign is lit up with light in a beautiful display.

Hinase&#x27;s main industry is Oyster (kaki) farming. The waters in the area contain many oyster-rafts and are quite picturesque at sunset when viewed from local hilltops. Oyster season is in winter (December to February) and many people come from other towns just to buy oysters from the local fish-market. In mid-February, Hinase hosts its annual Oyster Festival (Kaki-Matsuri. On this day oysters can be purchased fresh and cooked in public BBQ areas for consumption.
Local delicacies, such as Kaki-Oko (Oyster Okonomiyaki), a pancake-type dish with cabbage, vegetables, oysters and a piquant sauce) are proudly served up to visitors and locals alike.
Also famous in the area are Kaki-Fry (fried oysters) which can be served with a sauce, or in a soft-serve ice-cream covered in soya sauce.

Every summer, on August 13, the town hosts its annual summer fireworks festival (Minato Matsuri). From mid-afternoon, food stalls start selling their fare and amusement stalls offer entertainment for the children. In the evening, the highlight of the festival starts - a display of fireworks over the bay. On a stage nearby, locals perform dances (traditional Japanese-style and modern hip-hop), Taiko (drums) displays and even showcase local bands.

<text>East Orchard is a small village and parish in the county of Dorset in southern England. It lies in the Blackmore Vale within the North Dorset administrative district. It is situated roughly midway between the hilltop town of Shaftesbury and the riverside town of Sturminster Newton. It is separated from the neighbouring village of West Orchard by a small stream. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 100. For local government purposes the parish is grouped with the parishes of West Orchard and Margaret Marsh, to form a Group Parish Council.

==Etymology==
The name of East Orchard is first attested in a charter of 939 (surviving in a fifteenth-century copy), in the form &quot;Archet&quot;. It does not appear in the Domesday Book (the &quot;Horcerd&quot; found there is more likely to refer to Orchard near Church Knowle on Purbeck). The name derives from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;on&quot;) and (&quot;wood&quot;), and thus the name once meant &quot;at the wood&quot;. Its modern form shows assimilation to the English noun &quot;orchard&quot; through folk-etymology. The element &quot;East&quot; was added to the name later when the settlement became distinct from West Orchard.

<text>The landing at Anzac Cove on Sunday, 25 April 1915, also known as the landing at Gaba Tepe and, to the Turks, as the Arıburnu Battle, was part of the amphibious invasion of the Gallipoli Peninsula by the forces of the British Empire, which began the land phase of the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War.

The assault troops, mostly from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), landed at night on the western (Aegean Sea) side of the peninsula. They were put ashore north of their intended landing beach. In the darkness, the assault formations became mixed up, but the troops gradually made their way inland, under increasing opposition from the Ottoman Turkish defenders. Not long after coming ashore, the ANZAC plans were discarded, and the companies and battalions were thrown into battle piecemeal and received mixed orders. Some advanced to their designated objectives, while others were diverted to other areas and ordered to dig in along defensive ridge lines.

Although they failed to achieve their objectives, by nightfall the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, albeit much smaller than intended. In some places, they were clinging onto cliff faces with no organised defence system. Their precarious position convinced both divisional commanders to ask for an evacuation, but after taking advice from the Royal Navy about how practicable that would be, the army commander decided they would stay. The exact number of the day&#x27;s casualties is not known. The ANZACs had landed two divisions, but over two thousand of their men had been killed or wounded, together with at least a similar number of Turkish casualties.

Since 1916, the anniversary of the landings on 25 April has been commemorated as Anzac Day, becoming one of the most important commemorative dates for Australia and New Zealand. The anniversary is also commemorated in Turkey and the United Kingdom.

==Background==
The Ottoman Turkish Empire entered the First World War on the side of the Central Powers on 31 October 1914. The stalemate of trench warfare on the Western Front convinced the British Imperial War Cabinet that an attack on the Central Powers elsewhere, particularly Turkey, could be the best way of winning the war. From February 1915 this took the form of naval operations aimed at forcing a passage through the Dardanelles, but after several setbacks it was decided that a land campaign was also necessary. To that end, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was formed under the command of General Ian Hamilton. Three amphibious landings were planned to secure the Gallipoli Peninsula, which would allow the navy to attack the Turkish capital Constantinople, in the hope that would convince the Turks to ask for an armistice.

===Intention===
Lieutenant-General William Birdwood, commanding the inexperienced Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), comprising the Australian Division and two brigades of the New Zealand and Australian Division, was ordered to conduct an amphibious assault on the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The New Zealand and Australian Division normally also had two mounted brigades assigned to it, but these had been left in Egypt, as it was believed there would be no requirement or opportunities to use mounted troops on the peninsula. To bring the division up to strength, Hamilton had tried unsuccessfully to get a brigade of Gurkhas attached to them. In total ANZAC strength was 30,638 men.

The location chosen for the operation was between the headland of Gaba Tepe and the Fisherman&#x27;s Hut, to the north. Landing at dawn after a naval gunfire bombardment, the first troops were to seize the lower crests and southern spurs of Hill 971. The second wave would pass them to capture the spur of Hill 971, especially Mal Tepe. There they would be positioned to cut the enemy&#x27;s lines of communications to the Kilid Bahr Plateau, thus preventing the Turks from bringing reinforcements from the north to the Kilid Bahr Plateau during the attack by the British 29th Division which would advance from a separate beachhead further south-west. The capture of Mal Tepe was &quot;more vital and valuable than the capture of the Kilid Bahr Plateau itself.&quot;
Birdwood planned to arrive off the peninsula after the moon had set, with the first troops landing at 03:30, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. Instead, the troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault.

First ashore would be the Australian Division, commanded by Major-General William Bridges. The 3rd Australian Brigade, known as the covering force, were to capture the third ridge from Battleship Hill south along the Sari Bair mountain range to Gaba Tepe. The 2nd Australian Brigade, landing next, were to capture all the Sari Bar range up to Hill 971 on the left. The 26th Jacob&#x27;s Mountain Battery from the British Indian Army would land next and then the 1st Australian Brigade, the division&#x27;s reserve; all were to be ashore by 08:30. The New Zealand and Australian Division, commanded by Major-General Alexander Godley, followed them; the 1st New Zealand Brigade then the 4th Australian Brigade. Only after the second division had landed would the advance to Mal Tepe begin. The planners had come to the conclusion that the area was sparsely, if at all, defended, and that they should be able to achieve their objectives with no problems; Turkish opposition had not been considered.

===Turkish forces===
The First World War Ottoman Turkish Army was modelled after the German Imperial Army, with most of its members being conscripted for two years (infantry) or three years (artillery); they then served in the reserve for the next twenty-three years. The pre-war army had 208,000 men in thirty-six divisions, formed into army corps and field armies. On mobilisation each division had three infantry and one artillery regiment for a total of around ten thousand men, or about half the size of the equivalent British formation. Unlike the largely inexperienced ANZACs, all the Turkish Army commanders, down to company commander level, were very experienced, being veterans of the Italo-Turkish and Balkan Wars.
The British preparations could not be made in secret, and by March 1915, the Turks were aware that a force of fifty thousand British and thirty thousand French troops was gathering at Lemnos. They considered there were only four likely places for them to land: Cape Helles, Gaba Tepe, Bulair, or on the Asiatic (eastern) coast of the Dardanelles.

On 24 March, the Turks formed the Fifth Army, a force of over 100,000 men, in two corps of six divisions and a cavalry brigade, commanded by the German general Otto Liman von Sanders. The Fifth Army deployed the III Corps at Gallipoli and the XV Corps on the Asiatic coast. The 5th Division and a cavalry brigade were on the European mainland, positioned to support the III Corps if required. The III Corps had the 9th Division (25th, 26th and 27th infantry regiments), the 19th Division (57th, 72nd and 77th infantry regiments) and the 7th Division (19th, 20th and 21st infantry regiments). The 9th Division provided coastal defence from Cape Helles north to Bulair, where the 7th Division took over, while the 19th Division at Maidos was the corps reserve. The area around Gaba Tepe, where the ANZAC landings would take place, was defended by the 2nd battalion of the 27th Infantry Regiment.

==Anzac Cove==
On 19 April orders were issued for the ANZACs to stop training, and for all ships and small boats to take on coal and stores, in preparation for a landing originally scheduled to occur on 23 April. Weather conditions delayed their departure from Lemnos until dawn on 24 April. The Royal Navy battleships , , , , and , the cruiser , seven destroyers and four transport ships led the way carrying the 3rd Brigade. They were followed by the rest of the force who were embarked in their own transport ships.

===First six companies===
At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships stopped at sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers embarked the first six companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division&#x27;s headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46 m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.

Around 04:30 Turkish sentries opened fire on the boats, but the first ANZAC troops were already ashore at Beach Z, called Ari Burnu at the time, but later known as Anzac Cove. (It was formally renamed Anzac Cove by the Turkish government in 1985.) They were further north than intended, and instead of an open beach they were faced with steep cliffs and ridges up to around in height. However, the mistake had put them ashore at a relatively undefended area; at Gaba Tepe further south where they had planned to land, there was a strong-point, with an artillery battery close by equipped with two 15 cm and two 12 cm guns, and the 5th Company, 27th Infantry Regiment was positioned to counter-attack any landing at that more southern point. The hills surrounding the cove where the ANZACs landed made the beach safe from direct fire Turkish artillery. Fifteen minutes after the landing, the Royal Navy began firing at targets in the hills.
On their way in, the rowing boats had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion grounded to the north of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 8th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman&#x27;s Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong-point, equipped with two obsolescent multi-barrelled Nordenfelt machine-guns, and several smaller posts in the south.
Men from the 9th and 10th battalions started up the Ari Burnu slope, grabbing the gorse branches or digging their bayonets into the soil to provide leverage. At the peak they found an abandoned trench, the Turks having withdrawn inland. Soon the Australians reached Plugge&#x27;s Plateau, the edge of which was defended by a trench, but the Turks had withdrawn to the next summit inland, from where they fired at the Australians coming onto the plateau. As they arrived, Major Edmund Brockman of the 11th Battalion started sorting out the mess, sending the 9th Battalion&#x27;s men to the right flank, the 11th Battalion&#x27;s to the left, and keeping the 10th Battalion in the centre.

===Second six companies===
The second six companies landed while it was still dark, the destroyers coming to within to disembark the troops, under fire. They also landed at Anzac Cove, but now as planned the 11th were in the north, 10th in the centre and the 9th in the south. The 12th Battalion landed all along the beach. This extended the beachhead to the north of Ari Burnu, and to the south. Landing under fire, some of the assaulting troops were killed in their boats, and others as they reached the beach. Once ashore they headed inland. In the south, the first men from the 9th and 12th battalions reached the bottom of 400 Plateau.

In the north, the first men from the 11th and 12th battalions started up Walker&#x27;s Ridge, under fire from a nearby Turkish trench. Around the same time Turkish artillery started bombarding the beachhead, destroying at least six boats. The Australians fought their way forward and reached Russell&#x27;s Top; the Turks withdrew through the Nek to Baby 700, away. Coming under fire again the Australians went to ground, having advanced only around inland. Some also dug in at the Nek, a piece of high ground between Malone&#x27;s Gully to the north and Monash Valley to the south. Around this time Colonel Ewen Sinclair-Maclagan, commanding the 3rd Brigade, decided to change the corps plan. Concerned about a possible counter-attack from the south, he decided to hold the Second Ridge instead of pushing forward to the Third or Gun Ridge. This hesitation suited the Turkish defence plans, which required the forward troops to gain time for the reserves to coordinate a counter-attack.

===Turkish reaction===
At 05:45, Lieutenant-Colonel Mehmet Sefik of the Turkish 27th Infantry Regiment finally received orders to move his 1st and 3rd battalions to the west and support the 2nd Battalion around Gaba Tepe. The two battalions were already awake and assembled at Eceabat, having spent that night carrying out military exercises. They could not be sent to Ari Burnu right away as it was not marked on the Turkish maps. Colonel Halil Sami, commanding the 9th Division, also ordered the division&#x27;s machine-gun company and an artillery battery to move in support of the 27th Infantry Regiment, followed soon after by an 77 mm artillery battery. At 08:00 Lieutenant-Colonel Mustafa Kemal, commanding the 19th Division, was ordered to send a battalion to support them. Kemal instead decided to go himself with the 57th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery towards Chunuk Bair, which he realised was the key point in the defence; whoever held those heights would dominate the battlefield. By chance, the 57th Infantry were supposed to have been on an exercise that morning around Hill 971 and had been prepared since 05:30, waiting for orders.

At 09:00 Sefik and his two battalions were approaching Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and an hour and a half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. At around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby Knoll and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby Knoll, known to the Turks as &quot;Kemalyeri&quot; (Kemal&#x27;s Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.

==Baby 700==
Baby 700 is a hill in the Sari Bair range, next to Battleship Hill or Big 700. It was named after its supposed height above sea level, though its actual height is only .

Maclagen sent the 11th Battalion, Captain Joseph Lalor&#x27;s company of the 12th Battalion and Major James Robertson&#x27;s of the 9th, towards Baby 700. Brockman divided his own company, sending half up the right fork of Rest Gully, and half up the left, while Brockman and a reserve platoon headed up Monash Valley. As they moved forward, Turkish artillery targeted them with air burst shrapnel shells, which dispersed the companies. This, coupled with senior officers diverting men to other areas instead of towards Baby 700, meant only fragments of the units eventually reached Baby 700.
Arriving at Baby 700, Captain Eric Tulloch, 11th Battalion, decided to take his remaining sixty men towards Battleship Hill, leaving Lalor&#x27;s company to dig in and defend The Nek. Tulloch moved around to the right before advancing towards the summit. The 11th Battalion crossed the first rise unopposed, but at the second, Turkish defenders around away opened fire on them. Going to ground, the Australians returned fire. When the Turkish fire slackened the remaining fifty men resumed their advance, reaching the now-evacuated Turkish position, behind which was a large depression, with Battleship Hill beyond that. Still under fire they moved forward again, then around from the summit the Turks opened fire on them from a trench. The Australians held out for thirty minutes, but increasing Turkish fire and mounting casualties convinced Tulloch to withdraw. No other ANZAC unit would advance as far inland that day.

At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor decided to take their companies up Baby 700. Instead of going around to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, and for the next hour they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th battalions crossed Malone&#x27;s Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters at the head of Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.

===Second wave===

The 2nd Brigade landed between 05:30 and 07:00, and the reserve 1st Brigade landed between 09:00 and 12:00, already putting the timetable behind schedule.

Private Victor Rupert Laidlaw (2nd Field Ambulance) gave this eyewitness account of the landing:
The 2nd Brigade, which were supposed to be heading for Baby 700 on the left, were instead sent to the right to counter a Turkish attack building up there. At 07:20 Bridges and his staff landed; finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them, they set out to locate the 3rd Brigade headquarters.

The 1st Brigade were on the opposite flank to the 3rd Brigade and already getting involved in battles of their own, when their commander, Colonel Percy Owen, received a request from Maclagen for reinforcements. Owen sent two companies from the 3rd Battalion and one from the 1st Battalion (Swannell&#x27;s) to support the 3rd Brigade.

Soon after, Lalor&#x27;s company had been forced back to The Nek and the Turks were threatening to recapture Russell&#x27;s Top, and at 10:15 Maclagen reported to Bridges his doubts over being able to hold out. In response Bridges sent part of his reserve, two companies from the 2nd Battalion (Gordon&#x27;s and Richardson&#x27;s), to reinforce the 3rd Brigade.
At 11:00 Swannell&#x27;s company arrived at the foot of Baby 700, joining the seventy survivors of Robertson&#x27;s and Lalor&#x27;s companies. They immediately charged and chased the Turks back over the summit of Baby 700, then stopped and dug in. The two 2nd Battalion companies arrived alongside them, but all the companies had taken casualties, among the dead being Swannell and Robertson.

By this time most of the 3rd Brigade men had been killed or wounded, and the line was held by the five depleted companies from the 1st Brigade. On the left, Gordon&#x27;s company 2nd Battalion, with the 11th and 12th battalions&#x27; survivors, charged five times and captured the summit of Baby 700, but were driven back by Turkish counter-attacks; Gordon was among the casualties. For the second time Maclagen requested reinforcements for Baby 700, but the only reserves Bridges had available were two 2nd Battalion companies and the 4th Battalion. It was now 10:45 and the advance companies of the 1st New Zealand Brigade were disembarking, so it was decided they would go to Baby 700.

===Third wave===
The New Zealand brigade commander had been taken ill, so Birdwood appointed Brigadier-General Harold Walker, a staff officer already ashore, as commander. The Auckland Battalion had landed by 12:00, and were being sent north along the beach to Walker&#x27;s Ridge on their way to Russell&#x27;s Top. Seeing that the only way along the ridge was in single file along a goat track, Walker ordered them to take the route over Plugge&#x27;s Plateau. As each New Zealand unit landed they were directed the same way to Baby 700. However, in trying to avoid Turkish fire, they became split up in Monash Valley and Rest Gully, and it was after midday that two of the Auckland companies reached Baby 700.

At 12:30 two companies of the Canterbury Battalion landed and were sent to support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge&#x27;s Plateau, and were forming on the left of the 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands&#x27; left, waiting for the rest of their brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore. The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still well out at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came ashore, followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker&#x27;s Ridge to extend the corps&#x27; left flank. Events ashore now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come ashore. The transports carrying both divisions&#x27; artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.

===MacLaurin&#x27;s Hill===
MacLaurin&#x27;s Hill is a 1,000 yard (910 m) long section of the Second Ridge that connects Baby 700 to 400 Plateau, with a steep slope on the ANZAC side down to Monash Valley. In the coming days Quinn&#x27;s, Steel&#x27;s and Courtney&#x27;s posts would be built on the slope. The first ANZAC troops to reach the hill, from the 11th Battalion, found that the Turkish defenders had already withdrawn. As the Australians crested the hill they came under fire from Baby 700, but to their front was a short, shallow slope into Mule Valley. When Major James Denton&#x27;s company of the 11th Battalion arrived at the hill they started digging in, and soon after received orders from MacLagen to hold the position at all costs. At 10:00 Turkish troops, advancing from Scrubby Knoll, got to within of the Australians on the hill, opening fire at them. Altogether there were two and a half companies from the 11th Battalion between Courtney&#x27;s Post, Steele&#x27;s Post, and Wire Gully. They had not been there long before the 3rd Battalion arrived to reinforce them.

==400 Plateau==
The 400 Plateau, named for its height above sea level, was a wide and level plateau on the second ridge line, about wide and around from Gun Ridge. The northern half of the plateau became known as Johnston&#x27;s Jolly, and the southern half as Lone Pine, with Owen&#x27;s Gully between them.

===3rd Brigade===
If the landings had gone to plan, the 11th Battalion would have been crossing the plateau heading north. The 10th Battalion, south of the plateau, were to capture a Turkish trench and artillery battery behind Gun Ridge. The 9th Battalion, furthest south, were to attack the artillery battery at Gaba Tepe, and the 12th Battalion were the reserve, with 26th Jacob&#x27;s Mountain Battery to establish their gun line on the plateau. Unknown to the ANZACs, the Turks had an artillery battery sited on 400 Plateau.
After landing, some of the 9th and 10th battalions&#x27; men headed for 400 Plateau. The first 10th Battalion platoon to arrive was commanded by Lieutenant Noel Loutit, and accompanied by the brigade-major, Charles Brand. They discovered the Turkish battery in the Lone Pine sector, which was preparing to move. As the Australians opened fire the battery withdrew down Owen&#x27;s Gully. Brand remained on the plateau and ordered Loutit to continue after the Turkish battery. However, the guns had been hidden at the head of the gully and Loutit&#x27;s platoon moved beyond them. Around the same time, Lieutenant Eric Smith and his 10th Battalion scouts and Lieutenant G. Thomas with his platoon from the 9th Battalion arrived on the plateau, looking for the guns. As they crossed the plateau Turkish machine-guns opened fire on them from the Lone Pine area. One of Thomas&#x27;s sections located the battery, which had started firing from the gully. They opened fire, charged the gun crews, and captured the guns. The Turks did manage to remove the breech blocks, making the guns inoperable, so the Australians damaged the sights and internal screw mechanisms to put them out of action. By now the majority of the 9th and 10th battalions, along with brigade commander Maclagen, had arrived on the plateau, and he ordered them to dig in on the plateau instead of advancing to Gun Ridge. However, the units that had already passed beyond there were obeying their orders to &quot;go as fast as you can, at all costs keep going&quot;.

Loutit, Lieutenant J. Haig of the 10th, and thirty-two men from the 9th, 10th, and 11th battalions crossed Legge Valley and climbed a spur of Gun Ridge, just to the south of Scrubby Knoll. As they reached the top, about further inland was Gun Ridge, defended by a large number of Turkish troops. Loutit and two men carried out a reconnaissance of Scrubby Knoll, from the top of which they could see the Dardanelles, around to the east. When one of the men was wounded they returned to the rest of their group, which was being engaged by Turkish machine-gun and rifle fire. Around 08:00, Loutit sent a man back for reinforcements; he located Captain J. Ryder of the 9th Battalion, with half a company of men at Lone Pine. Ryder had not received the order to dig in, so he advanced and formed a line on Loutit&#x27;s right. Soon after, they came under fire from Scrubby Knoll and were in danger of being cut off; Ryder sent a message back for more reinforcements. The messenger located Captain John Peck, the 11th Battalion&#x27;s adjutant, who collected all the men around him and went forward to reinforce Ryder. It was now 09:30 and the men on the spur, outflanked by the Turks, had started to withdraw. At 10:00, the Turks set up a machine-gun on the spur and opened fire on the withdrawing Australians. Pursued by the Turks, only eleven survivors, including Loutit and Haig, reached Johnston&#x27;s Jolly and took cover. Further back, two companies of the 9th and the 10th battalions had started digging a trench line.

===2nd Brigade===
As part of the second wave, the 2nd Brigade had been landing since 05:30; the 5th, 6th and 8th battalions were supposed to cross 400 Plateau and head to Hill 971, while the 7th Battalion on the left were to climb Plugge&#x27;s Plateau then make for Hill 971. One 7th Battalion company, Jackson&#x27;s, landed beside the Fisherman&#x27;s Hut in the north and was almost wiped out; only forty men survived the landing. At 06:00 Major Ivie Blezard&#x27;s 7th Battalion company, and part of another, were sent onto 400 Plateau by Maclagen to strengthen the defence. When the 7th Battalion commander Lieutenant-Colonel Harold Elliott landed he realised events were not going to plan, and he headed to the 3rd Brigade headquarters to find out what was happening. Maclagen ordered him to gather his battalion at the south of the beachhead, as the 2nd Brigade would now form the division&#x27;s right flank, not left. When the 2nd Brigade commander Colonel James McCay arrived Maclagen convinced him to move his brigade to the south, swapping responsibility with the 3rd Brigade. Eventually agreeing, he established his headquarters on the seaward slope of 400 Plateau (McCay&#x27;s Hill). Heading onto the plateau, McCay realised the ridge to his right, Bolton&#x27;s Ridge, would be a key point in their defence. He located the brigade-major, Walter Cass, and ordered him to gather what men he could to defend the ridge. Looking around, he saw the 8th Battalion, commanded by Colonel William Bolton, moving forward, so Cass directed them to Bolton&#x27;s Ridge. As such, it was the only ANZAC battalion that remained together during the day. Eventually, at around 07:00, the rest of the brigade started arriving. As each company and battalion appeared they were pushed forward into the front line, but with no defined orders other than to support the 3rd Brigade. At 10:30 the six guns of the 26th Jacobs Mountain Battery arrived, positioning three guns on each side of White&#x27;s Valley. At noon, they opened fire on the Turks on Gun Ridge.

Within two hours half the Australian Division was involved in the battle of 400 Plateau. However, most of the officers had misunderstood their orders. Believing the intention was to occupy Gun Ridge and not hold their present position, they still tried to advance. The 9th and 10th battalions had started to form a defensive line, but there was a gap between them that the 7th Battalion was sent to fill. Seeing the 2nd Brigade coming forward, units of the 3rd Brigade started to advance to Gun Ridge. The advancing Australians did not then know that the counter-attacking Turkish forces had reached the Scrubby Knoll area around 08:00 and were prepared for them. As the Australians reached the Lone Pine section of the plateau, Turkish machine guns and rifles opened fire, decimating the Australians. To the north, other troops, advancing beyond Johnstone&#x27;s Jolly and Owen&#x27;s Gully, were caught by the same small arms fire. Soon afterwards, a Turkish artillery battery also started firing at them. This was followed by a Turkish counter-attack from Gun Ridge. Such was the situation they now found themselves in that, at 15:30, McCay, now giving up all pretence of advancing to Gun Ridge, ordered his brigade to dig in from Owen&#x27;s Gully to Bolton&#x27;s Ridge.

===Pine Ridge===
Pine Ridge is part of the 400 Plateau, and stretches, in a curve towards the sea, for around . Beyond Pine Ridge is Legge Valley and Gun Ridge and, like the rest of the terrain, it was covered in a thick gorse scrub, but it also had stunted pine trees around tall growing on it.
Several groups of men eventually made their way to Pine Ridge. Among the first was Lieutenant Eric Plant&#x27;s platoon from the 9th Battalion. Captain John Whitham&#x27;s company of the 12th Battalion moved forward from Bolton&#x27;s Ridge when they saw the 6th Battalion moving up behind them. As the 6th Battalion reached the ridge, the companies carried on towards Gun Ridge, while Lieutenant-Colonel Walter McNicoll established the battalion headquarters below Bolton&#x27;s Ridge. As the 6th Battalion moved forward they were engaged by Turkish small arms and artillery fire, causing heavy casualties. At 10:00 brigade headquarters received a message from the 6th Battalion asking for reinforcement, and McCay sent half the 5th Battalion to assist. At the same time, the 8th Battalion were digging in on Bolton&#x27;s (except for two companies which moved forward to attack a group of Turks that had come up from the south behind the 6th Battalion). By noon, the 8th Battalion were dug in on the ridge; in front of them were scattered remnants of the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 9th battalions, mostly out of view of each other in the scrub. Shortly after, McCay was informed that if he wanted the 6th Battalion to hold their position, it must be reinforced. So McCay sent his last reserves, a company of the 1st Battalion, and ordered the 8th to leave one company on the ridge and advance on the right of the 6th Battalion. The scattered formations managed to hold their positions for the remainder of the afternoon, then at 17:00 saw large numbers of Turkish troops coming over the southern section of Gun Ridge.

==Turkish counter-attack==
At around 10:00, Kemal and the 1st Battalion, 57th Infantry, were the first to arrive in the area between Scrubby Knoll and Chunuk Bair. From the knoll, Kemal was able to observe the landings. He ordered the artillery battery to set up on the knoll, and the 1st Battalion to attack Baby 700 and Mortar Ridge from the North-East, while the 2nd Battalion would simultaneously circle around and attack Baby 700 from the West. The 3rd Battalion would for the moment be held in reserve. At 10:30, Kemal informed II Corps he was attacking.

At 11:30, Sefik told Kemal that the ANZACs had a beachhead of around , and that he would attack towards Ari Burnu, in conjunction with the 19th Division. Around midday Kemal was appraised that the 9th Division was fully involved with the British landings at Cape Helles, and could not support his attack, so at 12:30 he ordered two battalions of the 77th Infantry Regiment (the third battalion was guarding Suvla Bay) to move forward between the 57th and 27th infantry regiments. At the same time, he ordered his reserve 72nd Infantry Regiment to move further west. Within the next half-hour the 27th and 57th infantry regiments started the counter-attack, supported by three batteries of artillery. At 13:00 Kemal met with his corps commander Esat Pasha and convinced him of the need to react in strength to the ANZAC landings. Esat agreed and released the 72nd and 27th infantry regiments to Kemal&#x27;s command. Kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south; 72nd, 57th, 27th and 77th. In total, Turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men.

===North===
At 15:15, Lalor left the defence of The Nek to a platoon that had arrived as reinforcements, and moved his company to Baby 700. There he joined a group from the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Leslie Morshead. Lalor was killed soon afterwards. The left flank of Baby 700 was now held by sixty men, the remnants of several units, commanded by a corporal. They had survived five charges by the Turks between 07:30 and 15:00; after the last charge the Australians were ordered to withdraw through The Nek. There, a company from the Canterbury Battalion had just arrived, with their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Douglas Stewart. By 16:00 the New Zealand companies had formed a defence line on Russell&#x27;s Top. On Baby 700, there was on the left Morsehead&#x27;s and Lalor&#x27;s men, and at the top of Malone&#x27;s Gulley were the survivors of the 2nd Battalion and some men from the 3rd Brigade. On the right were the men left from the Auckland companies, and a mixed group from the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th battalions. Once Stewart&#x27;s men were secure, he ordered Morsehead to withdraw. During a Turkish artillery bombardment of The Nek, Stewart was killed. The artillery heralded the start of a Turkish counter-attack; columns of troops appeared over the top of Battleship Hill and on the flanks and attacked the ANZAC lines.
At 16:30 the three battalions from the 72nd Infantry Regiment arrived and attacked from the north. At the same time the Australians and New Zealanders holding on at Baby 700 broke and ran back to an improvised line, from Walker&#x27;s Ridge in the north to Pope&#x27;s Hill in the south. The defence line at The Nek was now defended by nine New Zealanders, under the command of a sergeant; they had three machine-guns but the crews had all been killed or wounded. As the survivors arrived from Baby 700 their numbers rose to around sixty. Bridges in his divisional headquarters starting receiving messages from the front; just after 17:00 Lieutenant-Colonel George Braund on Walker&#x27;s Ridge advised he was holding his position and &quot;if reinforced could advance&quot;. At 17:37, Maclagen reported they were being &quot;heavily attacked&quot;, at 18:15 the 3rd Battalion signalled, &quot;3rd Brigade being driven back&quot;. At 19:15, from Maclagen again &quot;4th Brigade urgently required&quot;. Bridges sent two hundred stragglers, from several different battalions, to reinforce Braund and promised two extra battalions from the New Zealand and Australian Division which was now coming ashore.

Dusk was at 19:00 and the Turkish attack had now reached Malone&#x27;s Gulley and The Nek. The New Zealanders waited until the Turks came close, then opened fire in the darkness, stopping their advance. Seriously outnumbered, they asked for reinforcements. Instead, the supporting troops to their rear were withdrawn and the Turks managed to get behind them. So, taking the machine-guns with them, they withdrew off Russell&#x27;s Top into Rest Gully. This left the defenders at Walker&#x27;s Ridge isolated from the rest of the force.

===South===
The Australians on 400 Plateau had for some time been subjected to sniping and artillery fire and could see Turkish troops digging in on Gun Ridge. Around 13:00 a column of Turkish reinforcements from the 27th Infantry Regiment, in at least battalion strength, were observed moving along the ridge-line from the south. The Turks then turned towards 400 Plateau and advanced in extended order. The Turkish counter-attack soon forced the advanced Australian troops to withdraw, and their machine-gun fire caused heavy casualties. It was not long before the attack had forced a wedge between the Australians on Baby 700 and those on 400 Plateau. The heavy Turkish fire onto Lone Pine forced the survivors to withdraw back to the western slope of 400 Plateau. At 14:25, Turkish artillery and small arms fire was so heavy that the Indian artillerymen were forced to push their guns back off the plateau by hand, and they reformed on the beach.
Although in places there was a mixture of different companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton&#x27;s Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North of them were the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston&#x27;s Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.

At 15:30, the two battalions of the Turkish 77th Infantry Regiment were in position, and with the 27th Infantry they counter-attacked again. At 15:30 and at 16:45 McCay, now under severe pressure, requested reinforcements. The second time he was informed there was only one uninvolved battalion left, the 4th, and Bridges was keeping them in reserve until more troops from the New Zealand and Australian Division had been landed. McCay then spoke to Bridges directly and informed him that the situation was desperate and if not reinforced the Turks would get behind him. At 17:00, Bridges released the 4th Battalion to McCay who sent them to the south forming on the left of the 8th Battalion along Bolton&#x27;s Ridge. They arrived just in time to help counter Turkish probing attacks, by the 27th Infantry Regiment, from the south.

At 17:20, McCay signalled Bridges that large numbers of unwounded men were leaving the battlefield and heading for the beaches. This was followed by Maclagan asking for urgent artillery fire support, onto Gun Ridge, as his left was under a heavy attack and at 18:16 Owen reported the left flank was &quot;rapidly&quot; being forced to retire. At dusk, Maclagan made his way to Bridges headquarters and when asked for his opinion replied &quot;It&#x27;s touch and go. If the Turks come on in mass formation ... I don&#x27;t think anything can stop them.&quot; As it got dark the Turkish artillery ceased firing, and although small arms fire continued on both sides, the effects were limited when firing blind. Darkness also provided the opportunity to start digging more substantial trenches and to resupply the troops with water and ammunition.

The last significant action of the day was at 22:00, south of Lone Pine, when the Turks charged towards Bolton&#x27;s Ridge. By now, the 8th Battalion had positioned two machine guns to cover their front, which caused devastation amongst the attackers; and, to their left, the 4th Battalion also became involved. When the Turks got to within , the 8th Battalion counter-attacked in a bayonet charge, and the Turks withdrew. The ANZAC defence was aided by Royal Navy searchlights providing illumination. Both sides now waited for the next attack, but the day&#x27;s events had shattered both formations, and they were no longer in any condition to conduct offensive operations.

==Aftermath==
By nightfall, around sixteen thousand men had been landed, and the ANZACs had formed a beachhead, although with several undefended sections. It stretched along Bolton&#x27;s Ridge in the south, across 400 Plateau, to Monash Valley. After a short gap it resumed at Pope&#x27;s Hill, then at the top of Walker&#x27;s Ridge. It was not a large beachhead; it was under in length, with a depth around , and in places only a few yards separated the two sides. That evening Birdwood had been ashore to check on the situation, and, satisfied, returned to HMS &quot;Queen&quot;. Around 21:15 he was asked to return to the beachhead. There he met with his senior officers, who asked him to arrange an evacuation. Unwilling to make that decision on his own, he signalled Hamilton;

Both my divisional generals and brigadiers have represented to me that they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there is likely to be a fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; &quot;dig yourselves right in and stick it out ... dig, dig, dig until you are safe&quot;. The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.

On the Turkish side, by that night the 2nd Battalion, 57th Infantry, were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south of them was the 77th Infantry, next were the 27th Infantry opposite 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th infantry regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their objectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, &quot;on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division.&quot; The division commander, Kemal, became noted as &quot;the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side&quot; during the campaign. As a commander he was able to get the most out of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; &quot;Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place.&quot;

In the following days there were several failed attacks and counter-attacks by both sides. The Turks were the first to try during the Second attack on Anzac Cove on 27 April, followed by the ANZACs who tried to advance overnight on 1-2 May. The Turkish Third attack on Anzac Cove, on 19 May, was the worst defeat of them all, with around ten thousand casualties, including three thousand dead. The next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks, until 6 August when the ANZACs, in connection with the Landing at Suvla Bay, attacked Chunuk Bair with only limited success. The Turks never succeeded in driving the Australians and New Zealanders back into the sea. Similarly, the ANZACs never broke out of their beachhead. Instead, in December 1915, after eight months of fighting, they evacuated the peninsula.

===Casualties===
The full extent of casualties on that first day is not known. Birdwood, who did not come ashore until late in the day, estimated between three and four hundred dead on the beaches. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage claims one in five of the three thousand New Zealanders involved became a casualty. The Australian War Memorial has 860 Australian dead between 25–30 April, and the Australian government estimates 2,000 wounded left Anzac Cove on 25 April, but more wounded were still waiting on the battlefields to be evacuated. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission documents that 754 Australian and 147 New Zealand soldiers died on 25 April 1915. A higher than normal proportion of the ANZAC casualties were from the officer ranks. One theory was that they kept exposing themselves to fire, trying to find out where they were or to locate their troops. Four men were taken prisoner by the Turks.

Private Victor Laidlaw of the 2nd Field Ambulance recorded in his diary the dangers faced in treating the casualties:
Several days later he again describes the work of the field ambulance with the many wounded:
It is estimated that the Turkish 27th and 57th infantry regiments lost around 2,000 men, or fifty per cent of their combined strength. The full number of Turkish casualties for the day has not been recorded. During the campaign, 8,708 Australians and 2,721 New Zealanders were killed. The exact number of Turkish dead is not known but has been estimated around 87,000.
===Anzac Day===
The anniversary of the landings, 25 April, has since 1916 been recognised in Australia and New Zealand as Anzac Day, now one of their most important national occasions. It does not celebrate a military victory, but instead commemorates all the Australians and New Zealanders &quot;who served and died in all wars, conflicts, and peacekeeping operations&quot; and &quot;the contribution and suffering of all those who have served&quot;. Around the country, dawn services are held at war memorials to commemorate those involved. In Australia, at 10:15, another service is held at the Australian War Memorial, which the prime minister and governor general normally attend. The first official dawn services were held in Australia in 1927 and in New Zealand in 1939. Lower-key services are also held in the United Kingdom. In Turkey, large groups of Australians and New Zealanders have begun to gather at Anzac Cove, where in 2005 an estimated 20,000 people attended the service to commemorate the landings. Attendance figures rose to 38,000 in 2012 and 50,000 in 2013.
