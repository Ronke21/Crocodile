<text>Rueil-Malmaison () or simply Rueil is a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, in the Hauts-de-Seine department, Île-de-France region. It is located from the centre of Paris. It is one of the wealthiest suburbs of Paris.

==Name==
Rueil-Malmaison was originally called simply Rueil. In medieval times the name Rueil was spelled either , , , , or . This name is made of the Gaulish word (meaning &#x27;clearing, glade&#x27; or &#x27;place of&#x27;) suffixed to a radical meaning &#x27;brook, stream&#x27; (, ), or maybe to a radical meaning &#x27;ford&#x27; (Celtic ).

In 1928, the name of the commune officially became Rueil-Malmaison in reference to its most famous tourist attraction, the Château de Malmaison, home of Napoleon&#x27;s first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais.

The name Malmaison comes from Medieval Latin , meaning &#x27;ill-fated domain&#x27;, &#x27;estate of ill luck&#x27;. In the Early Middle Ages Malmaison was the site of a royal residence which was destroyed by the Vikings in 846.

==History==

The territory of Rueil has been frequented since very ancient times: during foundation work for the construction of a new neighborhood near the Seine, at the &quot;Closeaux&quot; site, a Mesolithic site of an Azilian people (10,300 to 8,700 BCE) was uncovered. Remains of an Eurasian cave lion, dating back 12,000 years, were also discovered there.

The first historical mention of Rueil, or rather of Rotoialum villae, dates back to the 6th century, in the History of the Franks written by Gregory of Tours. The term refers to what was then a Roman-style villa. Also known as Roialum or Rotariolensem villam, it was a place of leisure and hunting for Merovingian kings from the 6th to the 8th century.
The Rueil barracks of the Swiss Guard were constructed in 1756 under Louis XV by the architect Charles-Axel Guillaumot, and have been classified &quot;Monument historique&quot; since 1973. The Guard was formed by Louis XIII in 1616 and massacred at the Tuileries on 10 August 1792 during the French Revolution.

Around 870, Charles the Bald gave this estate to the Abbey of Saint-Denis. At the end of the 12th century, Benedictine monks built a chapel dedicated to Saint Cucufa in the former Béranger woods, which later, after the 18th century, became known as the “Saint-Cucufa woods.”

During the Edward III’s Chevauchée in 1346, Rueil was burned and thoroughly devastated by the Black Prince, taking a long time to recover from this disaster.
In 1584, Antoine of Portugal, exiled in France, lived in Rueil and laid the first stone of a church on the site of the old one, which was in ruins.

In 1622, Christophe Perrot, a counselor to the Parliament of Paris, had a château built on the site called Malmaison, an estate that would become, in the following century, the property of the future Empress Joséphine.

The monks sold the estate in 1633 to Cardinal Richelieu, who settled at the Château du Val, built for Jean Moisset, a financier under Henri IV. Far from the intrigues and noise of the city, it became his favorite residence. Richelieu also funded the completion of the Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul church by having its façade constructed by his architect Lemercier.

In 1691, the Marquise de Maintenon, the king’s secret wife, rented a house in Rueil to receive poor children and provide them with some education. This was the precursor to the institution she would later establish in Saint-Cyr, closer to Versailles.

In 1754, the construction of the barracks, along with those in Courbevoie and Saint-Denis, and the arrival of a Swiss Guards regiment in Rueil significantly increased the population. The Rueil barracks (now the Guynemer barracks, next to the Swiss Guards Museum), built by architect Charles-Axel Guillaumot, is still in use today and is the only one of the three original Swiss Guards barracks that remains.

On April 21, 1799, the Château de Malmaison was purchased by General Bonaparte&#x27;s wife, Marie-Josèphe Tascher de la Pagerie, widow of the Viscount de Beauharnais and wife of General Bonaparte, who, out of jealousy, called her “Josephine.” As the château’s owner, Josephine had it renovated by architects Percier and Fontaine. During the Consulate, Napoleon spent considerable time there, both for leisure and work. Decisions made there included, for example, the Louisiana Purchase and the establishment of the Legion of Honor. After their divorce, the Emperor allowed his former wife to retain her title as Empress and her ownership of Malmaison. Deeply fond of the estate, Josephine had heated greenhouses built to pursue her passion for botany. After his defeat, Napoleon abdicated at Fontainebleau and left for exile on April 20, 1814. It was in Rueil, where she had welcomed Tsar Alexander I of Russia and sought his protection, that the former Empress died on May 29 of that year. Her remains were interred in the Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul Church. 

The following year, after the Hundred Days, Anglo-Prussian forces took Rueil and looted it. While the British ransacked Malmaison, the Prussians entered Masséna’s property, ravaged the park, stripped the château of all portable items, and smashed the furniture.

In 1866, with the Empire restored and the town having grown, it was decided to build a new town hall. It was also during this period that Emperor Napoleon III funded the partial restoration of Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul Church, which contained the tombs of his mother and grandmothers and had fallen into disrepair. Rueil also became home to the Infanta Marie-Isabella of Spain, the eldest daughter of Queen Isabella II of Spain, and her husband, Prince Gaetano of Bourbon-Sicily, when the Spanish royal family was exiled by the revolution of 1868.

During the Siege of Paris from 1870 to 1871, in the Franco-Prussian War, Rueil, the surrounding villages, and the Château de Buzenval became battle sites, notably on October 21, 1870, and January 19, 1871, during the first and second battles of Buzenval, where French troops from Paris clashed with Prussian soldiers entrenched on the Garches heights.

The commune has three war memorials commemorating this conflict. The first, located on Rue du Général-Colonieu, named after an Algerian rifleman officer distinguished in battle, was designed by architect Charles Chipiez at the request of the Seine department in memory of the second battle. It features a large stone shell adorned with garlands. The second, located in the old cemetery, was created by architect Albert Julien and inaugurated in 1886. It is a massive obelisk made of blue granite. On the four sides of the base are bronze medallions sculpted by Antide Péchiné. Finally, the third is situated on Rue du Commandant-Jacquot, behind a doorway framed by two pilasters, on a small walled plot. This is a column topped with a cross. The inscription “Raoul de Kreuznach, October 21, 1870, De profundis” honors this young man of 19, killed shortly after joining the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr. His father managed to locate his initial resting place, where he lay among the bodies of other soldiers, and purchased this plot from a local farmer to erect the monument, which he later donated to the State. The association Le Souvenir Français continues to maintain it to this day.

In 1899, an American philanthropic couple, Mr. and Mrs. Tuck, settled in Rueil at the Vermont estate and did much for the town: they funded the construction of the Stell Hospital (named after Mrs. Tuck&#x27;s maiden name), built schools, and helped to preserve Bois-Préau and the Château de Malmaison.

At that time, Rueil was popular among Parisians for its riverside guinguettes along the Seine, a tradition that dates back to the 1850s, thanks in part to the railway line. Boating on the Seine was also in vogue. Rueil was still a town of market gardening, vineyards, and laundries.

During the 1910 Seine flood, Rueil was inundated, like neighboring towns along the river. On January 29, the daily newspaper Le Journal wrote: &quot;In Rueil, three infantry battalions arrived yesterday morning to guard properties abandoned by their residents.

Occupied by the Germans in 1940, the town was the site of resistance executions at the Mont-Valérien fort. It was liberated on August 19, 1944. On June 23, 1943, an FTP-MOI commando led by Rino Della Negra attacked the Guynemer barracks.

The new Hôtel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1978.

==Population==
==Sights==
The Château de Malmaison, the residence of Napoléon&#x27;s first wife Joséphine de Beauharnais, is located in Rueil-Malmaison. It is home to a Napoleonic museum.
Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul Church housing notable graves.
===In poetry===
Lydia Huntley Sigourney&#x27;s poem &quot;Tomb of Josephine&quot; was published in her volume &#x27;Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands&#x27; published in 1842 and follows her visit to Europe in 1840.

==Economy==
The main campus of the French Institute of Petroleum research organisation is in Rueil. The city has also become home to many large companies moving out of La Défense business district, located only from Rueil, a trend first established by the move of Esso headquarters to Rueil.

There are about 850 service sector companies located in Rueil, 70 of which employ more than 100 people. A business district called &quot;Rueil-sur-Seine&quot; (previously known as &quot;Rueil 2000&quot;) was created near the RER A Rueil-Malmaison station to accommodate these companies. The business district is equipped with a fiber-optic network.

Several major French companies have their world headquarters in Rueil-Malmaison, such as Schneider Electric and VINCI. Schneider had its head office in Rueil-Malmaison since 2000; previously the building Schneider occupies housed the Schneider subsidiary Télémécanique.

Several large international companies have also located their French headquarters in Rueil-Malmaison, including as ExxonMobil, AstraZeneca, American Express and Unilever.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Rueil-Malmaison is served by Rueil-Malmaison station on RER A. In the future, the commune will be served by Rueil – Suresnes – Mont Valérien station on Line 15 of the Grand Paris Express (GPE), which will be located on the border with the commune of Suresnes, as well as a western extension of Île-de-France tramway Line 1.

===Healthcare===
The Stell Hospital, a teaching hospital of Sorbonne University, is located in Rueil-Malmaison.

===Museums===
The area has a local history museum, the Musée d&#x27;histoire locale de Rueil-Malmaison. Since 21 May 2016 it has been home to the Ancient Egyptian mummy of a five-year-old called Ta-Iset.

<text>A codebook is a type of document used for gathering and storing cryptography codes. Originally, codebooks were often literally books, but today &quot;codebook&quot; is a byword for the complete record of a series of codes, regardless of physical format.

==Cryptography==
In cryptography, a codebook is a document used for implementing a code. A codebook contains a lookup table for coding and decoding; each word or phrase has one or more strings which replace it. To decipher messages written in code, corresponding copies of the codebook must be available at either end. The distribution and physical security of codebooks presents a special difficulty in the use of codes compared to the secret information used in ciphers, the key, which is typically much shorter.

The United States National Security Agency documents sometimes use &quot;codebook&quot; to refer to block ciphers; compare their use of &quot;combiner-type algorithm&quot; to refer to stream ciphers.

Codebooks come in two forms, one-part or two-part: 
* In one-part codes, the plaintext words and phrases and the corresponding code words are in the same alphabetical order. They are organized similar to a standard dictionary. Such codes are half the size of two-part codes but are more vulnerable since an attacker who recovers some code word meanings can often infer the meaning of nearby code words. One-part codes may be used simply to shorten messages for transmission or have their security enhanced with superencryption methods, such as adding a secret number to numeric code words.
* In two-part codes, one part is for converting plaintext to ciphertext, the other for the opposite purpose. They are usually organized similarly to a language translation dictionary, with plaintext words (in the first part) and ciphertext words (in the second part) presented like dictionary headwords. 

The earliest known use of a codebook system was by Gabriele de Lavinde in 1379 working for the Antipope Clement VII.

Two-part codebooks go back as least as far as 
Antoine Rossignol in the 1800s.

From the 15th century until the middle of the 19th century,
nomenclators (named after nomenclator) were the most used cryptographic method.

Codebooks with superencryption were the most used cryptographic method of World War I.

The JN-25 code used in World War II used a codebook of 30,000 code groups superencrypted with 30,000 random additives.

The book used in a book cipher or the book used in a running key cipher can be any book shared by sender and receiver and is different from a cryptographic codebook.

==Social sciences==
In social sciences, a codebook is a document containing a list of the codes used in a set of data to refer to variables and their values, for example locations, occupations, or clinical diagnoses.

==Data compression==
Codebooks were also used in 19th- and 20th-century commercial codes for the non-cryptographic purpose of data compression.

Codebooks are used in relation to precoding and beamforming in mobile networks such as 5G and LTE. The usage is standardized by 3GPP, for example in the document TS 38.331, NR; Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification.

<doc id="530787" wikidata="Q1143866" url="?curid=530787" title="Ring (diacritic)">
<text>A ring diacritic may appear above or below letters. It may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in various contexts.

==Rings==

===Distinct letter===
The character Å (å) is derived from an A with a ring. It is a distinct letter in the Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, Walloon, and Chamorro alphabets. For example, the 29-letter Swedish alphabet begins with the basic 26 Latin letters and ends with the three letters Å, Ä, and Ö.

===Overring===

The character Ů (ů) a Latin U with overring, or is a grapheme in Czech preserved for historic reasons, and represented a vowel shift. For example, the word for &quot;horse&quot; used to be written &quot;kóň&quot;, which evolved, along with pronunciation, into &quot;kuoň&quot;. Ultimately, the vowel disappeared completely, and the &quot;uo&quot; evolved into &quot;ů&quot;, modern form &quot;kůň&quot;. The letter &quot;ů&quot; now has the same pronunciation as the letter &quot;ú&quot; (long ), but changes to a short &quot;o&quot; when a word is morphed (e.g. nom. &quot;kůň&quot; → gen. &quot;koně&quot;, nom. &quot;dům&quot; → gen. &quot;domu&quot;), thus showing the historical evolution of the language. &quot;Ů&quot; cannot occur in initial position, while &quot;ú&quot; occurs almost exclusively in initial position or at the beginning of a word root in a compound. These characters are used also in Steuer&#x27;s Silesian alphabet. The pronunciation has prevailed in some Moravian dialects, as well as in Slovak, which uses the letter ô instead of ů.

The ring is used in some dialects of Emilian and Romagnol to distinguish the sound (å) from (a).

ů was used in Old Lithuanian in Lithuania Minor from the 16th till the beginning of the 20th century and for a shorter time in 16th-century Lithuania Major for diphthong .

The ring was used in the Lithuanian Cyrillic alphabet promoted by Russian authorities in the last quarter of the 19th century with the letter У̊ / у̊ used to represent the diphthong (now written &quot;uo&quot; in Lithuanian orthography).

ẘ and ẙ are used in the ISO 233 romanization of the Arabic alphabet. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨⟩ (wāw) with a sukūn () is romanized as aẘ. A fatḥah followed by the letter ⟨⟩ (yā’) with a sukūn over it () is romanized as aẙ.

Ring upon e (e̊) is used by certain dialectologists of Walloon (especially Jean-Jacques Gaziaux) to note the vowel typically replacing and in the Brabant province central Walloon dialects. The difficulty of type-writing it has led some writers to prefer &quot;ë&quot; for the same sound.

==Unicode ==
Many more characters can be created in Unicode using the combining character , including the above-mentioned у̊ (Cyrillic у with overring) or ń̊ (n with acute and overring).

The standalone (spacing) symbol is .
The unrelated, but nearly identical degree symbol is .

Although similar in appearance, it is not to be confused with the Japanese &quot;handakuten&quot; (), a diacritic used with the &quot;kana&quot; for syllables starting with &quot;h&quot; to indicate that they should instead be pronounced with . In Japanese dialectology, handakuten is used with &quot;kana&quot; for syllables starting with &quot;k&quot; to indicate their consonant is , with syllables starting with &quot;r&quot; to indicate their consonant is &quot;l&quot; though this does not change the pronunciation, with &quot;kana&quot; &quot;u&quot; to indicate its morph into &quot;kana&quot; &quot;n&quot;, and with &quot;kana&quot; &quot;i&quot; to indicate the vowel is to be said as .

In Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, there are two ring characters: ᐤ (Cree and Ojibwe final &quot;w&quot;, or Sayisi &quot;o&quot;) and ᣞ (Cree and Ojibwe final &quot;w&quot; or final &quot;y&quot;). This second smaller ring can combine as a diacritic ring above in Moose Cree and Moose-Cree influenced Ojibwe as a final &quot;y&quot;; in Inuktitut, the ring above the /_i/ character turns it into a /_aai/ character. In Western Cree, /_w_w/ sequence is represented as ᐝ.

In addition to the combining character option, Unicode has some precomposed characters:

===Underring===
The underring is used in IPA to indicate voicelessness, and in Indo-European studies or in Sanskrit transliteration (IAST) to indicate syllabicity of sonorants. 

Unicode encodes the underring as a combining character at . Unicode also has precomposed characters for the letters and with undering ( and ). Precomposed character encodings for &#x27;R with ring below&#x27;, &#x27;L with ring below&#x27;, &#x27;R with ring below and macron&#x27;, and &#x27;L with ring below and macron&#x27; were proposed, because of their use in Sanskrit transliteration and the CSX+ Indic character set. This proposal was rejected, because they are already encoded as combining character sequences.

==== Pashto ====
In Pashto romanization, is used to represent .

====Emilian====
In Emilian, can be used to represent unstressed in very accurate transcriptions.

==== Romagnol ====
In Romagnol, is used to represent in diphthongs, e.g. Santarcangelo dialect &quot;ame̥ig&quot; &#x27;friend&#x27;, &quot;ne̥ud&quot; &#x27;naked&#x27;.

===Half rings===
Half rings also exist as diacritic marks; these are characters and . These characters are used in the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet, respectively for mediopalatal pronunciation and strong-onset vowels. These characters may be used in the International Phonetic Alphabet, denoting less and more roundedness, as alternatives to half rings below and . They are here given with the lowercase a: a͑ and a͗, a̜ and a̹.

 is similar in appearance but differs from a͗ because its compatibility decomposition uses instead of .

Other, similar signs are in use in Armenian: the and the .

Breve and inverted breve are also shaped like half rings, respectively, the bottom and top half of a circle.

===Other uses===
The ring is used in the transliteration of Abkhaz to represent the letter ҩ. It may also be used in place of the abbreviation symbol &quot;॰&quot; when transliterating the Devanagari alphabet.

== Letters with ring ==
==Similar marks==
The ring as a diacritic mark should not be confused with the dot or diacritic marks, or with the degree sign °.

The half ring as a diacritic mark should not be confused with the comma or ogonek diacritic marks.

<text>Frederick George Payne (July 24, 1904 – June 15, 1978) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Republican Party, he served as a U.S. senator from Maine from 1953 to 1959. He previously served as the 60th governor of Maine from 1949 to 1952.

==Early life and education==
Frederick Payne was born in Lewiston, Maine, to Frederick and Nellie (née Smart) Payne. He received his early education at public schools in his native city, graduating from Jordan High School. As a child, he worked as a newsboy, grocery clerk, theater usher, and dishwasher. He studied at the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating in 1925.

==Early business and political career==
Payne then worked as a financial manager and chief disbursing officer for the Maine &amp; New Hampshire Theaters Company, which operated 132 movie theaters in New England. He began his political career as mayor of Augusta, serving from 1935 to 1941. In 1940, he unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination for Governor of Maine, losing to state senator Sumner Sewall. After Sewall was elected governor, he named Payne as the state finance commissioner and budget director. He resigned in 1942 in order to serve with the U.S. Air Force during World War II, reaching the rank of a lieutenant colonel. Following his military service, he worked as manager of Waldoboro Garage Company from 1945 to 1949.

==Governor of Maine==
In 1948, Payne was elected the 60th governor of Maine after defeating his Democratic opponent, Biddeford mayor Louis Lausier, by a margin of 66%-34%. He was later re-elected in 1950, defeating Democrat Earl Grant by 61%-39%. During his tenure, he created a two-percent sales tax, expanded the Maine Development Commission, and began a long-range highway modernization program financed by a $27 million bond issue.

During Payne&#x27;s second term as governor, he was accused of accepting a bribe involving the state liquor industry. A wine bottler claimed he paid $12,000 to a Boston promotion man for the latter&#x27;s supposed influence with Payne and the state liquor chairman. However, after testifying before a special investigating committee, Payne was cleared of all charges.

==U.S. Senator==
In 1952, Payne was elected to the U.S. Senate. He defeated incumbent senator Owen Brewster in the Republican primary, and went on to defeat Democrat Roger P. Dube in the general election.

During the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Payne supported legislation to ban automatic-opening or switchblade knives. During congressional hearings, Payne suggested that he believed immigrants to be the source of gang violence: &quot;Isn&#x27;t it true that this type of knife, switchblade knife, in its several different forms, was developed, actually, abroad, and was developed by the so-called scum, if you want to call it, or the group who are always involved in crime?&quot; The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958. Senator Payne and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon. However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members turned to firearms instead of knives. Payne did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

Payne was soundly defeated for reelection in 1958 by Democratic governor Ed Muskie. He died in 1978 in Waldoboro, Maine, aged 73.

<text>Mestwin II ( or &quot;Mszczuj II&quot;) ( 1220 – December 25, 1294) was a Duke of Pomerelia, member of the Samborides dynasty. He ruled Pomerelia as a sole ruler from 1273 to 1294.

==Early life==
Mestwin II was the son of Swietopelk II and the Přemyslid dynasty princess Eufrozyna. As a young man, in 1243 he was taken into the Teutonic Order custody as a hostage, part of the ceasefire agreement between his father and the Order, but the Order did not keep their part of this agreement and failed to return Mestwin II who was held by them until 1248 (for some time in the Order castle in Austria) when finally released.

==Acquiring power==
Most likely upon returning from Teutonic Order captivity his father made Mestwin II the Duke of Świecie (Schwetz) province circa 1250, and upon his father&#x27;s death he began his challenge against his younger brother for Gdańsk (Danzig) in 1266, starting the so-called Pomerelian Civil War that lasted until 1273. He fought his younger brother and uncles until he emerged victorious and finally became the principal Pomerelia prince and sole ruler in 1273. He united all the lands of Pomerelia (after the death of his uncles, Sambor II, prince of Lubiszewo (Lübschau) and Racibor Białogardzki, prince of Białogarda (Belgard an der Leba).

==Alliances==
Mestwin placed himself under the protection of the Ascanian Margraves of Brandenburg by recognizing their enfeoffment with Pomerania, which had already been made by the German Emperor Fredrick Barbarossa and renewed in December 1231 in Ravenna by Emperor Frederick II. In the Treaty of Arnswalde on April 1, 1269, he took his area of power as a fief from the Brandenburg markgraves. The Brandenburg Ascanians were suzerains of the Duchy of Pomerania and in return for military and financial help he gave oath of fealty and paid homage over a couple Pomeralian to these dukes. 

Mestwin&#x27;s brother Wratislaw II of Pomerania, principal Pomerelian duke and ruler of Gdańsk (Danzig), was forced out of his duchy by Mestwin II and most likely his new ally in 1271. This action resulted in Wratislaw II and Sambor II military action against Mestwin II, and his own knights and nobles rebelled against him. Surrounded by adversity and even taken prisoner (for a short time in 1270) Mestwin II gave the possession of Danzig to the Brandenburg duke Conrad who was holding the city of Danzig until Mestwin II forced them to resign from their possession of the city by use of force in 1273, having been strengthened by new alliance with his maternal cousin Bolesław Pobożny, the duke of Great Poland. Defeated Wartislaw II found refuge with Ziemomysł of Kuyavia, the duke of Inowrocław and sought assistance from the Order, but he died unexpectedly in Wyszogród in 1271. The remaining male relatives of Mestwin II, his uncles Sambor II and Racibor, allied with the Order and various Piast princes, lost their possession within the Pomerelia due to Mestwin II actions against them, and also sought refuge with the Order and their daughters in Kujawy (Sambor) and Śląsk (Racibor). Both uncles died in the 1270s leaving Mestwin II the sole ruler of all unified Duchy of Pomerelia. Now he was faced with challenges from Brandenburg, the Teutonic Order, Pomeranian and Piast princes. As a result of the Order actions he was forced to give his castles and villages on the right bank of Vistula to them, and also the important left bank Pomerelian stronghold of Gniew (Mewe), willed to the Order by his uncle Sambor II, a claim Mestwin II recognized under duress and Papal mediation in 1282. These pressures forced Mestwin II to tighten his alliance with Greater Poland&#x27;s Bolesław and his successor Przemysł II.

==Treaty of Kępno==
Mestwin II and Przemysl II, new duke of Greater Poland and future king of Poland, concluded the Treaty of Kępno in 1282 that was at first kept secret. The treaty, confirmed by magnates and nobles of both duchies, made both Mestwin and Przemysł II either a successor per donatio inter vivos or successor in all his possessions. It is known that Mestwin II remained the Pomerelia ruler until his death in 1294. It seems that the treaty of Kępno in fact unified Pomerelia and Greater Poland, starting the long process of reunification of Polish principalities by the Piast dynasts. During the life of Mestwin II nobles and magnates of Greater Poland received grants and appointments to Pomerelian offices and estates. In 1287 both princes entered into another successor treaty in Słupsk, and there they included in their succession treaty another Western Slavic prince, Bogusław IV of Szczecin (Bogislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania). This treaty was confirmed and arrangement made public in Nakło, in 1291. These treaties resulted directly from aggressive policies of March of Brandenburg and the Teutonic Order against the territories of these Slavic duchies and provinces.

==Relations==
He had three wives. First came princess Judith, daughter of Ditrich I duke of Brenna i Wettin, who died before 1275, then he married Piast princess Euphrosyne of Opole circa 1275 and they divorced in 1288, and finally married rather unknown Sulisława who died in 1292. He had two daughters: Katarzyna (Katherine), who married Pribislaw II, and Eufemia, eventually married to a Slavic or German prince.

He died in Danzig and was buried in the Cistercian Oliwa monastery. His own sarcophagus did not survive, most likely having been destroyed when the army of Danzig burned down the abbey during their rebellious war against king Stephen Báthory in 1577. However, the cumulative sepulcher of the Samboride dynasty still remains, founded in 1615 by one of the Oliwa abbots, Dawid Konarski.

<text>The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) is a 9.2-metre optical telescope designed mainly for spectroscopy. It consists of 91 hexagonal mirror segments each with a 1-metre inscribed diameter, resulting in a total hexagonal mirror of 11.1 by 9.8 m. However, its effective aperture is only 9.2 m. It is located close to the town of Sutherland in the semi-desert region of the Karoo, South Africa. It is a facility of the South African Astronomical Observatory, the national optical observatory of South Africa.

SALT is the largest optical telescope in the southern hemisphere. It enables spectroscopic and polarimetric analysis and imaging of the radiation from astronomical objects that are out of reach of northern hemisphere telescopes.

It is closely based on the Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory, with some changes in its design, especially to the spherical aberration corrector. The main purpose for these changes was to improve the telescope&#x27;s field of view. It shares the same fixed mirror altitude design, which limits access to 70% of the visible sky.

First light with the full mirror was declared on 1 September 2005, with 1-arc-second resolution images of globular cluster 47 Tucanae, open cluster NGC 6152, spiral galaxy NGC 6744, and the Lagoon Nebula. The official opening by President Thabo Mbeki took place during the inauguration ceremony on 10 November 2005.

South Africa contributed about a third of the total of US$36 million that will finance SALT for its first 10 years (US$20 million for the construction of the telescope, US$6 million for instruments, and US$10 million for operations). The rest was contributed by the other partners: Germany, Poland, the United States, the United Kingdom, and New Zealand.

==General information==
SALT is located on a hilltop 1837 m above sea level in a nature reserve in the Hantam, Karoo north-east of Cape Town, near the small town of Sutherland. In March 2004, installation of the massive mirror began. The last of the 91 smaller mirrored hexagon segments was put in place in May 2005.

Korea, Japan, Poland and Google have telescopes at the site and South Africa has at least five optical telescopes there. The University of Birmingham has a solar telescope to help monitor the Sun.
SALT will probe quasars and enable scientists to view stars and galaxies a billion times too faint to be seen by the naked eye.

==Primary mirror==


Both SALT and HET have an unusual design for an optical telescope. Similar to the Keck Telescopes, the primary mirror is composed of an array of mirrors designed to act as a single larger mirror; however, the SALT mirrors produce a spherical primary, rather than the paraboloid shape associated with a classical Cassegrain telescope. Each SALT mirror is a 1-meter hexagon, and the array of 91 identical mirrors produces a hexagonally shaped primary 11 by 9.8 meters in size. To compensate for the spherical primary, the telescope has a four-mirror spherical aberration corrector (SAC) that provides a corrected, flat focal plane with a field of view of 8 arcminutes at prime focus.
Each of the 91 mirrors is made of low-expansion Sitall glass and can be adjusted in tip, tilt and piston in order to properly align them so as to act as a single mirror. Because the mirror is spherical, light emitted from a position corresponding to the center of curvature of the mirror is reflected and refocused to the same position. Therefore, the telescope employs a center-of-curvature alignment sensor (CCAS) situated at the top of a tall tower adjacent to the dome. Laser light is shone down on all the segments, and the position of the reflections from each mirror measured. A process called &quot;stacking&quot; thus allows the telescope operator to optimize the adjustments of the mirrors.

The telescope is also unusual in that during an observation, the mirror remains at a fixed altitude and azimuth, and the image of an astronomical target produced by the telescope is tracked by the &quot;payload&quot;, which resides at the position of prime focus and includes the SAC and prime-focus instrumentation. This is similar in operation to the Arecibo Radio Telescope. Although this results in only a limited observing window per target, it greatly simplifies the primary mirror mount, when compared to a fully steerable telescope, transferring the complexity to the smaller and lighter payload tracking system, providing for an overall reduction in total telescope construction cost. SALT has a fixed zenith angle of 37 degrees, optimised for the Magellanic clouds, but because of the full range of azimuths and the celestial rotation, SALT has access to a good fraction of the sky available at the Sutherland site.

Another consequence of this design is that the entrance pupil varies in size during the tracking of a target.

==Instrumentation==
The first generation instrumentation for SALT includes the SALT Imaging Camera (SALTICAM), designed and built by the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO); the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) (née Prime Focus Imaging Spectrograph), a multi-purpose long-slit and multi-object imaging spectrograph and spectropolarimeter, designed and built by the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Rutgers University, and the SAAO; and a fiber-fed High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS), designed by the University of Canterbury (New Zealand). SALTICAM was installed in early 2005, while the RSS was installed on 11 October 2005.

==Internet connectivity==
The telescope is connected to the SAAO site in Cape Town via a 1 Gbit/s fibre connection over the SANREN network. The SAAO has a 1 Gbit/s connection to the SANREN network with 30 Mbit/s of that link being the international portion.

== Research ==
Research using SALT at the South African Astronomical Observatory has led the facility to important discoveries. By using the Southern African Large Telescope, SAAO has the ability to take &quot;snapshots&quot; of stars in very quick succession. It is optimized for wavelengths and observing modes not available on other very large telescopes. As a result, astronomers can study rapidly changing properties of compact stars, primarily as they pull in gas from their companion stars or surroundings. The significance of this discovery allows us to detect black holes. The gravitational field of a compact star commonly pulls in gas from a companion star, thus radiation (especially X-ray) is emitted. Scientists used this as an indirect way to locate black holes. Another phenomenon that SALT has helped astronomers investigate is the way that masses build up on some compact stars until supernova explosions blow them apart, which gives scientists a &quot;Type 1a&quot; supernovae used to show that the expansion of the universe is speeding up.

Other note-worthy research the South African Astronomical Observatory has achieved using SALT include the discovery of a class of stars known as &quot;polar&quot;, or a pair of stars. The &quot;polar&quot; binary star system, where a compactor star called a &quot;white dwarf&quot; whose volume has shrunk about one millionth of a star like the Sun. Studies using SALT concluded that these polar binary star systems take only an hour and a half to complete an orbit. Also, the SALT telescope allows scientists to study the rapid brightness changes in exotic stars.

More research using SALT has aided astronomers to investigate the structure and evolution of our galaxy, such as quasars, Magellanic clouds, the galactic structure and stellar astrophysics. SALT released its first color images, which marked the achievement of the &quot;first light&quot;. This also marked the debut of the fully operating SALTICAM, which is a $600,000 digital camera designed and built for SALT.

== Tourism ==

Despite initial estimates by SAAO that SALT would bring up to 30,000 tourists to Sutherland, the telescope has so far only resulted in about 14,000 annual visitors, which has nevertheless resulted in the creation of at least 300 jobs in the town of 5,000.

<text>15760 Albion (provisional designation ) was the first trans-Neptunian object to be discovered after Pluto and Charon. Measuring about 108–167 kilometres in diameter, it was discovered in 1992 by David C. Jewitt and Jane X. Luu at the Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. After the discovery, they dubbed the object &quot;Smiley&quot; and it was shortly hailed as the tenth planet by the press. It is a &quot;cold&quot; classical Kuiper belt object and gave rise to the name &quot;cubewano&quot; for this kind of object, after the portion of its designation. Decoding its provisional designation, &quot;QB1&quot; reveals that it was the 27th object found in the second half of August of that year. As of January 2018, around 2,400 further objects have been found beyond Neptune, a majority of which are classical Kuiper belt objects. It was named after Albion from William Blake&#x27;s mythology.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Albion from the complex mythology of English poet and painter William Blake (1757–1827). Albion is the island-dwelling primeval man whose division resulted into &quot;The Four Zoas&quot;: Urizen, Tharmas, Luvah/Orc and Urthona/Los. The name Albion itself derives from the ancient and mythological name of Britain. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 31 January 2018 ().

The discoverers suggested the name &quot;Smiley&quot; for , but the name was already used for an asteroid 1613 Smiley, named after the American astronomer Charles Hugh Smiley. It has received the number 15760 and remained unnamed until January 2018 (it was normally referred to simply as &quot;QB1&quot;, even though this was technically ambiguous without the year of discovery).
==Legacy==
The next year in 1993, objects in similar orbits were found including (15788) 1993 SB, (15789) 1993 SC, (181708) 1993 FW, and (385185) 1993 RO.

Over one thousand bodies were found in the Kuiper belt orbiting between about 30 and 50 AU from the Sun in the twenty years after finding 15760 Albion. This revealed a vast belt of bodies, more than just Pluto and Albion themselves. By 2018, over 2000 Kuiper belt objects were discovered.

== Physical characteristics ==
Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, Albion measures approximately 167 kilometers (107 miles) in diameter, for an assumed albedo of 0.9 and an magnitude of 7.0. According to Mike Brown, who estimates a mean diameter of 108 km (66 mi), the object is too small for being considered a dwarf planet candidate (&quot;probably not&quot;). As of 2021, no rotational lightcurve for this body has been obtained from photometric observations. Its rotation period and pole, as well as its composition and shape remain unknown.

<text>The mushroom bodies or corpora pedunculata are a pair of structures in the brain of arthropods, including insects and crustaceans, and some annelids (notably the ragworm &quot;Platynereis dumerilii&quot;). They are known to play a role in olfactory learning and memory. In most insects, the mushroom bodies and the lateral horn are the two higher brain regions that receive olfactory information from the antennal lobe via projection neurons. They were first identified and described by French biologist Félix Dujardin in 1850.

==Structure==
Mushroom bodies are usually described as neuropils, i.e., as dense networks of neuronal processes (dendrite and axon terminals) and glia. They get their name from their roughly hemispherical &quot;calyx&quot;, a protuberance that is joined to the rest of the brain by a central nerve tract or &quot;peduncle&quot;.

Most of our current knowledge of mushroom bodies comes from studies of a few species of insect, especially the cockroach &quot;Periplaneta americana&quot;, the honey bee &quot;Apis mellifera&quot;, the locust and the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. Studies of fruit fly mushroom bodies have been particularly important for understanding the genetic basis of mushroom body functioning, since their genome has been sequenced and a vast number of tools to manipulate their gene expression exist.

In the insect brain, the peduncles of the mushroom bodies extend through the midbrain. They are mainly composed of the long, densely packed nerve fibres of the Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom bodies. These cells have been found in the mushroom bodies of all species that have been investigated, though their number varies. Fruit flies, for example, have around 2,500, whereas cockroaches have about 200,000.

A locust brain dissection to expose the central brain and carry out electro-physiology recordings can be seen here. 

== Evolutionary history ==
Historically, it was believed that only insects had mushroom bodies, because they were not present in crabs and lobsters. However, their discovery in the mantis shrimp in 2017 lead to the later conclusion that the mushroom body is the ancestral state of all arthropods, and that this feature was later lost in crabs and lobsters.

==Function==
Mushroom bodies are best known for their role in olfactory associative learning. These olfactory signals are received from dopaminergic, octopaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic neurons outside the MB. They are largest in the Hymenoptera, which are known to have particularly elaborate control over olfactory behaviours. However, since mushroom bodies are also found in anosmic primitive insects, their role is likely to extend beyond olfactory processing. Anatomical studies suggest a role in the processing of visual and mechanosensory input in some species. In Hymenoptera in particular, subregions of the mushroom body neuropil are specialized to receive olfactory, visual, or both types of sensory input. In Hymenoptera, olfactory input is layered in the calyx. In ants, several layers can be discriminated, corresponding to different clusters of glomeruli in the antennal lobes, perhaps for processing different classes of odors. There are two main groups of projection neurons dividing the antennal lobe into two main regions, anterior and posterior. Projection neuron groups are segregated, innervating glomerular groups separately and sending axons by separate routes, either through the medial-antenno protocerebral tract (m-APT) or through the lateral-antenno protocerebral tract (l-APT), and connecting with two layers in the calyx of the mushroom bodies. In these layers the organization of the two efferent regions of the antennal lobe is represented topographically, establishing a coarse odotopic map of the antennal lobe in the region of the lip of the mushroom bodies.

Mushroom bodies are known to be involved in learning and memory, particularly for smell, and thus are the subject of current intense research. In larger insects, studies suggest that mushroom bodies have other learning and memory functions, like associative memory, sensory filtering, motor control, and place memory. Research implies that mushroom bodies generally act as a sort of coincidence detector, integrating multi-modal inputs and creating novel associations, thus suggesting their role in learning and memory. Recent work also shows evidence for the involvement of the mushroom body in innate olfactory behaviors through interactions with the lateral horn, possibly making use of the partially stereotyped sensory responses of the mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) across individuals. Although the connections between the projection neurons and the Kenyon cells are random (i.e., not stereotyped across individuals), the stereotypy in MBON responses is made possible by the dense convergence of many Kenyon cells onto a few MBONs along with other network properties.

Information about odors may be encoded in the mushroom body by the identities of the responsive neurons as well as the timing of their spikes. Experiments in locusts have shown that Kenyon cells have their activity synchronized to 20-Hz neural oscillations and are particularly responsive to projection neuron spikes at specific phases of the oscillatory cycle.

===Sleep===
The neurons which receive signals from serotonergic and GABAergic neurons outside the MB produce wakefulness, and experimentally stimulating these serotonergic upstream neurons forces sleep. The target neurons in the MB are inhibited by serotonin, GABA, and the combination of both. On the other hand octopamine does not seem to affect the MB&#x27;s sleep function.

==&quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;==
We know that mushroom body structures are important for olfactory learning and memory in &quot;Drosophila&quot; because their ablation destroys this function. The mushroom body is also able to combine information from the internal state of the body and the olfactory input to determine innate behavior. The exact roles of the specific neurons making up the mushroom bodies are still unclear. However, these structures are studied extensively because much is known about their genetic make-up. There are three specific classes of neurons that make up the mushroom body lobes: α/β, α’/β’, and γ neurons, which all have distinct gene expression. A topic of current research is which of these substructures in the mushroom body are involved in each phase and process of learning and memory. &quot;Drosophila&quot; mushroom bodies are also often used to study learning and memory and are manipulated due to their relatively discrete nature. Typically, olfactory learning assays consist of exposing flies to two odors separately; one is paired with electric shock pulses (the conditioned stimulus, or CS+), and the second is not (unconditioned stimulus, or US). After this training period, flies are placed in a T-maze with the two odors placed individually on either end of the horizontal ‘T’ arms. The percent of flies that avoid the CS+ is calculated, with high avoidance considered evidence of learning and memory.

===Cellular memory traces===
Recent studies combining odor conditioning and cellular imaging have identified six memory traces that coincide with molecular changes in the &quot;Drosophila&quot; olfactory system. Three of these traces are associated with early forming behavioral memory. One such trace was visualized in the antennal lobe (AL) by synapto-pHluorin reporter molecules. Immediately after conditioning, an additional set of projection neurons in a set of eight glomeruli in the AL becomes synaptically activated by the conditioned odor, and lasts for only 7 minutes. A second trace is detectable by GCaMP expression, and thus an increase in Ca2+ influx, in the α’/β’ axons of the mushroom body neurons. This is a longer-lasting trace, present for up to one hour following conditioning. The third memory trace is the reduction of activity of the anterior-paired lateral neuron, which acts as a memory formation suppressor through one of its inhibitory GABAergic receptors. Decrease in calcium response of APL neurons and subsequent decrease in GABA release onto the mushroom bodies persisted up to 5 minutes after odor conditioning.

The intermediate term memory trace is dependent on expression of the &quot;amn&quot; gene located in dorsal paired medial neurons. An increase in calcium influx and synaptic release that innervates the mushroom bodies becomes detectable approximately 30 minutes after pairing of electric shock with an odor, and persists for at least an hour. Both long-term memory traces that have been mapped depend on activity and protein synthesis of CREB and CaMKII, and only exist after spaced conditioning. The first trace is detected in α/β neurons between 9 and 24 hours after conditioning, and is characterized by an increase in calcium influx in response to the conditioned odor. The second long-term memory trace forms in the γ mushroom bodies and is detected by increase calcium influx between 18 and 24 hours after conditioning 

===cAMP dynamics===
Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP or cyclic AMP) is a second messenger that has been implicated in facilitating mushroom body calcium influx in Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body neurons. cAMP elevation induces presynaptic plasticity in Drosophila. cAMP levels are affected by both neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and octopamine, and odors themselves. Dopamine and octopamine are released by mushroom body interneurons, while odors directly activate neurons in the olfactory pathway, causing calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels.

In a classical conditioning paradigm, pairing neuronal depolarization (via acetylcholine application to represent the odor or CS) with subsequent dopamine application (to represent the shock or US), results in a synergistic increase in cAMP in the mushroom body lobes. These results suggest that the mushroom body lobes are a critical site of CS/US integration via the action of cAMP. This synergistic effect was originally observed in Aplysia, where pairing calcium influx with activation of G protein signaling by serotonin generates a similar synergistic increase in cAMP.

Additionally, this synergistic increase in cAMP is mediated by and dependent on rutabaga adenylyl cyclase (rut AC), which is sensitive to both calcium (which results from voltage-gated calcium channel opening by odors) and G protein stimulation (caused by dopamine). While a forward pairing of neuronal depolarization and dopamine, (acetylcholine followed by dopamine) results in a synergistic increase in cAMP, a forward pairing of neuronal depolarization and octopamine produces a sub-additive effect on cAMP. More specifically, this means that this pairing produces significantly less cAMP than the sum of each stimulus individually in the lobes. Therefore, rut AC in mushroom body neurons works as a coincidence detector with dopamine and octopamine functioning bidirectionally to affect cAMP levels.

===PKA dynamics===

Protein kinase A (PKA) has been found to play an important role in learning and memory in &quot;Drosophila&quot;. When calcium enters a cell and binds with calmodulin, it stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC), which is encoded by the rutabaga gene (&quot;rut&quot;). This AC activation increases the concentration of cAMP, which activates PKA. When dopamine, an aversive olfactory stimulant, is applied it activates PKA specifically in the vertical mushroom body lobes. This spatial specificity is regulated by the dunce (&quot;dnc&quot;) PDE, a cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase. If the dunce gene is abolished, as found in the &quot;dnc&quot; mutant, the spatial specificity is not maintained. In contrast, an appetitive stimulation created by an octopamine application increases PKA in all lobes. In the &quot;rut&quot; mutant, a genotype in which the rutabaga is abolished, the responses to both dopamine and octopamine were greatly reduced and close to experimental noise.

Acetylcholine, which represents the conditioned stimulus, leads to a strong increase in PKA activation compared to stimulation with dopamine or octopamine alone. This reaction is abolished in &quot;rut&quot; mutants, which demonstrates that PKA is essential for sensory integration. The specificity of activation of the alpha lobe in the presence of dopamine is maintained when dopamine is in combination with acetylcholine. Essentially, during a conditioning paradigm when a conditioned stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus, PKA exhibits heightened activation. This shows that PKA is required for conditioned learning in &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;.

==&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;==
Stimulus output responses are the product of pairs of excitation and inhibition. This is the same pattern of organisation as with mammals&#x27; brains. These patterns may, as with mammals, precede action. this is an area only recently elucidated by Zwaka et al 2018, Duer et al 2015, and Paffhausen et al 2020.

<doc id="530803" wikidata="Q920331" url="?curid=530803" title="Scotty Bowman">
<text>William Scott Bowman (born September 18, 1933) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey head coach. He holds the record for most wins in National Hockey League (NHL) history, with 1,244 wins in the regular season and 223 in the Stanley Cup playoffs, and his 14 Stanley Cup wins ranks second most of all time for any player, coach or executive. He coached the St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Buffalo Sabres, Pittsburgh Penguins and Detroit Red Wings. He was most recently the senior advisor of hockey operations for the Chicago Blackhawks, until stepping down in July 2022. Bowman is often regarded as the greatest coach in NHL history.

As head coach, Bowman has won a record nine Stanley Cup championships; five with the Canadiens (, , , , and ), one with the Penguins () and three with the Red Wings (, , and ). He has also won the Stanley Cup five times as a member of an organization&#x27;s front office. He was director of player development for the 1991 Penguins, consultant with the Detroit Red Wings, and senior advisor of hockey operations for the , , and Chicago Blackhawks. Bowman is the only NHL coach to lead three teams to Stanley Cup victories. Bowman won the Jack Adams Award in 1977 and 1996. In the 1976–77 season, he won a record 60 games, breaking his own record of 58 wins the year before. He broke his own record again in the 1995–1996 season, with 62 wins; overall, he held the record for 46 years, until . His eight losses in 1976–77 are a modern record for the fewest defeats incurred. His teams also made it to the Stanley Cup Finals a record 13 times and the semifinals a record 16 times.

==Career==
Bowman played junior league hockey with the Montreal Junior Canadiens until a fractured skull, resulting from repeated intentional slashes by Jean-Guy Talbot during the 1951 playoffs, ended his long term playing aspirations.

Bowman started coaching, in 1956, as an assistant to head coach Sam Pollock with the Ottawa-Hull Canadiens in the Quebec Junior Hockey League. The following season, as head coach, Bowman&#x27;s team won the 1958 Memorial Cup. Soon thereafter, he moved into a coaching job with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHA), the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; junior farm team.

===St. Louis Blues===
Bowman moved into the NHL in 1967 when he joined the expansion St. Louis Blues as an assistant coach under general manager and head coach Lynn Patrick. However, Patrick resigned as coach after a slow start, and Bowman took over at age 34. The Blues made it to the Stanley Cup finals in their first three years of existence as Western Conference (Expansion) champs. Bowman assumed general manager duties after Patrick gave up that job in the summer of 1968. Bowman remained in St. Louis until the end of the 1970–71 season but left due to a dispute with team ownership.

===Montreal Canadiens===
Al MacNeil, took over as head coach in of the Montreal Canadiens in December 1970 and lead them to a Stanley Cup victory, but in the process alienated many fans when he benched Henri Richard in the Cup finals. A few weeks after winning the 1971 Stanley Cup, MacNeil decided to resign as the head coach and become both the general manager and coach of the Canadiens&#x27; main farm team, the Nova Scotia Voyageurs. Bowman was hired the same day that MacNeil resigned and joined the Canadiens as head coach on June 10, 1971. General manager Sam Pollock hired Bowman, in part, because he was fluently bilingual in English and French. His team lost in the first round of the playoffs in 1972 but won the Stanley Cup in 1973. The Canadiens would make the playoffs over the next two seasons but lost in the first and third rounds, as the Philadelphia Flyers won the Stanley Cup.

From 1976 to 1979, Bowman won four consecutive Stanley Cups with a talented Canadiens squad that included Guy Lafleur, Steve Shutt, Larry Robinson, and Ken Dryden. Bowman&#x27;s team won at least 45 games in each of his eight seasons. However, after a falling-out with ownership, Bowman stepped down after the 1978–79 season. The reason for the falling-out was the team&#x27;s decision to pass him over as the new general manager of the club in September 1978, as they hired Irving Grundman, a Pollock &quot;protégé&quot;, instead. The Canadiens&#x27; dynasty ended after Bowman and several key players left the team. Bowman remains second all-time in Canadiens history in both wins and winning percentage, behind Toe Blake in both categories.

Not only did Bowman and general manager Sam Pollock preside together over a Canadiens dynasty, but also many of their players went on to have successful coaching and managing roles with their own teams.

===Buffalo Sabres===
For the 1979–80 season, Bowman moved to the Buffalo Sabres as coach and general manager. He served as the team&#x27;s general manager until 1987, doubling as coach on three separate occasions. During this time, he missed the playoffs for the only time in his coaching career, in the 1985–86 season. In his first year, he hired former Toronto Maple Leafs head coach, Roger Neilson to be his associate coach. For the 1980–81 season, Neilson became the head coach and Bowman focused on being the general manager. A dispute arose on how the team should be coached, forcing Neilson to part ways with the team in June 1981, and Bowman resumed being both coach and general manager. 

Bowman joined the Sabres around the same time that their stars were growing old. While the Sabres remained competitive for much of his tenure, he was unable to build them into anything approaching the powerhouses he had coached in Montreal. Bowman resigned during the 1986–87 season and was replaced by Gerry Meehan 12 games into the season. He left the Sabres as coach with the most wins in their history; he has since been passed by Lindy Ruff. He then become the color commentator for the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; usually alongside Don Wittman.

===Pittsburgh Penguins===
He became the director of player personnel of the Pittsburgh Penguins in 1990 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1991 as a builder.

In the summer, Bob Johnson, who had just won the Stanley Cup with the Penguins, was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing him to step down before he died on November 26, 1991. Bowman took over as the team&#x27;s head coach where the Penguins repeated as Stanley Cup champions in a season dedicated to Johnson.

The next season, the Penguins had their first 100-point season in franchise history and finished with the league&#x27;s best record. The 1992–93 Penguins under Bowman set the NHL record for consecutive wins in the regular season with 17. Their 119 points is still a franchise record. In the playoffs, the Penguins were upset in seven games in the Patrick Division finals by the New York Islanders coached by Al Arbour, a former Bowman player with the Blues.

After his two seasons as head coach in Pittsburgh, he was offered a long-term deal by the club. However, he indicated that he was not interested in their initial offer, which was not disclosed to the public, so they rescinded it. &quot;We have to get somebody who wants to coach this team,&quot; Penguins owner Howard Baldwin said. &quot;Scotty was clearly looking elsewhere.&quot;

===Detroit Red Wings===
In 1993–94, Bowman became coach of the Detroit Red Wings, and led them to a first-place finish in the Western Conference, but his Red Wings were ousted in the first round by the San Jose Sharks. According to an apocryphal story, Bowman had difficulty in the maze-like tunnels of the San Jose Arena, eventually having to be rescued after getting lost and twice locking himself into rooms.

In 1995, the Red Wings made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, their first finals appearance in 29 years, but were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four straight. In the 1995–96 regular season, he won a record 62 games. However, they lost to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference finals.

In the 1997 playoffs, Bowman led the team to its first Stanley Cup in 42 years by sweeping the Philadelphia Flyers 4–0. The Red Wings repeated the feat the following season (1998) by defeating the Washington Capitals in four games.

In 1999 and 2000, they lost to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference semifinals, and in 2001 they were eliminated by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round.

Bowman decided in February 2002 that he would retire at the end of the season, and he went out as a winner as his Red Wings won the Stanley Cup by defeating the Carolina Hurricanes, four games to one. During the presentation of the Cup on the ice, Bowman put on an old pair of skates so he could take a lap with the Cup. He then publicly announced his retirement from coaching. At the time of his retirement, he was second on the Red Wings&#x27; all-time wins list, behind Jack Adams. He is now third, behind Adams and Mike Babcock.

Bowman received the Wayne Gretzky International Award in 2002.

===Team Canada===
Bowman has coached the Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the international level twice in his career. In the 1976 Canada Cup his team won gold over Czechoslovakia and silver in the 1981 Canada Cup against the Soviet Union.

==Coaching record==

==Retirement==
In 2003, Bowman was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Since his retirement as coach in 2002, Bowman worked as a special consultant to the Red Wings. On August 3, 2007, it was reported that Bowman was offered the position of President of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Bowman later appeared in an interview on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; on January 12, 2008, confirming that he was very close to taking the job only to be turned away by Richard Peddie, CEO of Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE). In July 2008, he took a position as senior advisor of hockey operations for the Chicago Blackhawks to work alongside his son Stan Bowman, who was the general manager. The Blackhawks&#x27; Stanley Cup victory in 2010 gave Bowman his 12th Stanley Cup including coaching and team management, and the Blackhawks&#x27; 2013, and 2015 Stanley Cup victories were Bowman&#x27;s 13th and 14th respectively. Bowman stepped down from his advisory role in Chicago on July 1, 2022, saying that &quot;it was time to move on.&quot; 

In 2012, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada &quot;for his contributions to hockey as a coach and mentor&quot;.

On February 8, 2017, it was announced that Bowman would receive Order of Hockey in Canada award in a ceremony on June 19.

==Personal life==

As of January 2018, Bowman was living in Sarasota, Florida, attending all of the Tampa Bay Lightning home games in his role as the senior advisor of hockey operations for the Chicago Blackhawks, which were managed by his son Stan Bowman until October 26, 2021, when Stan resigned from the Blackhawks organization.

<text>Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia () was the founder of the school of &quot;Prophetic Kabbalah&quot;. He was born in Zaragoza, Spain, in 1240, and is assumed to have died sometime after 1291 following a stay on the small and windswept island of Comino (the smallest of the three inhabited islands that make up the Maltese archipelago).

==Biography==

===Early life and travels===
Very early in life he was taken by his parents to Tudela, Navarre, where his aged father, Samuel Abulafia, instructed him in the Hebrew Bible and Talmud. In 1258, when Abulafia was eighteen years old, his father died, and Abulafia began a life of ceaseless wandering shortly thereafter. His first journey, in 1260, was to the Land of Israel, where he intended to begin a search for the legendary Sambation and the Ten Lost Tribes. He got no further than &#x27;Akko, however, because of the desolation and lawlessness in the Holy Land stemming from the chaos following the recent Crusade. The battle that year between the Mongol Empire and Mamluk Sultanate forced his return to Europe via Greece. He had determined to go to Rome but stopped short in Capua, where during the early 1260s, he devoted himself with passionate zeal to the study of philosophy and &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; of Maimonides under the tutelage of a philosopher and physician named Hillel—probably the well-known Hillel ben Samuel of Verona.

Although he always held Maimonides in the highest esteem, and often made use of sentences from his writings, he was as little satisfied with his philosophy as with any other branch of knowledge which he acquired. He was highly articulate, and able and eager to teach others. He wrote industriously on Kabbalistic, philosophical, and grammatical subjects, and succeeded in surrounding himself with numerous pupils to whom he imparted much of his own enthusiasm.

On his return to Spain he became subject to visions, and, at the age of thirty-one, in Barcelona, began to study a particular kind of Kabbalah whose most important representative was Barukh Togarmi, and received a revelation with messianic overtones. He immersed himself in the study of the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Book of Creation&quot;), which explained the creation of the world and humankind as based on Hebrew letter combinations, as well as its commentaries. The &quot;Sefer&quot;, and particularly the commentary and method of the German Jewish mystic Eleazar of Worms, exercised a deep influence upon Abulafia and had the effect of greatly increasing his mystical bent. Letters of the alphabet, numerals, and vowel-points all assumed mystical meaning to him, and their combinations and permutations, supplementing and explaining one another, possessed an illumining power most effectively disclosed in a deep study of the divine names (especially of the consonants of the Tetragrammaton). With such auxiliaries, and with the observance of certain rites and ascetic practises, men, he said, may attain the highest aim of existence and become prophets; not in order to work miracles and signs, but to reach the highest degree of perception and be able to penetrate intuitively into the inscrutable nature of the Deity, the riddles of creation, the problems of human life, the purpose of the precepts, and the deeper meaning of the Torah.

He soon left for Castile, where he disseminated his prophetic Kabbalah among figures like Rabbi Moses of Burgos and his most important disciple, Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla. However, it bears mention that Abulafia is not mentioned in any of Gikatilla&#x27;s works.

Some time around 1275; he taught &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; and his Kabbalah in a few cities in Greece. He wrote the first of his prophetic books, &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; (&quot;Book of the Upright/Righteous&quot;), in Patras in 1279. That same year, he made his way through Trani back to Capua, where he taught four young students.

===Journey to Rome===
He went to Rome in 1280 in order to convert Pope Nicholas III to Judaism on the day before Rosh Hashanah. The Pope was in Soriano when he heard of it, and he issued orders to &quot;burn the fanatic&quot; as soon as he reached that place. The stake was erected in preparation close to the inner gate; but Abulafia set out for Soriano all the same and reached there August 22. While passing through the outer gate, he heard that the Pope had died from an apoplectic stroke during the preceding night. He returned to Rome, where he was thrown into prison by the Order of Friars Minor but was liberated after four weeks&#x27; detention. He was next heard of in Sicily.

===Decline and exile to Comino===
He remained active in Messina for a decade (1281–91), presenting himself as a &quot;prophet&quot;, &quot;messiah&quot; and &quot;son of God&quot;. He had several students there as well as some in Palermo. The local Jewish congregation in Palermo energetically condemned Abulafia&#x27;s conduct, and around 1285 addressed the issue to Shlomo ben Aderet of Barcelona, who devoted much of his career to calming the various messianic hysteriae of the day. Shlomo ben Aderet subsequently wrote a letter against Abulafia. This controversy was one of the principal reasons for the exclusion of Abulafia’s Kabbalah from the Spanish schools.

Abulafia had to take up the pilgrim&#x27;s staff anew, and under distressing conditions compiled his &quot;Sefer haOt&quot; &quot;Book of the Sign&quot; on the little island of Comino, near Malta, between 1285 and 1288. In 1291 he wrote his last, and perhaps his most intelligible work, the meditation manual &quot;Imrei Shefer&quot; &quot;Words of Beauty&quot;; after this, all trace of him is lost.

==Teachings==
===Writings===
Abulafia’s literary activity spans the years 1271–1291 and consists of several books, treatises on grammar, and poems, but amongst which only thirty survive. He wrote many commentaries: three on the &quot;Guide of the Perplexed&quot; – &quot;Sefer ha-Ge’ulah&quot; (1273), &quot;Sefer Chayei ha-Nefesh&quot;, and &quot;Sefer Sitrei Torah&quot; (1280); on &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot;: – &quot;Otzar Eden Ganuz&quot; (1285/6), &quot;Gan Na&#x27;ul&quot;, and a third untitled; and a commentary on the &quot;Pentateuch&quot; – &quot;Sefer-Maftechot ha-Torah&quot; (1289).

More influential are his handbooks, teaching how to achieve the prophectic experience: &quot;Chayei ha-Olam ha-Ba&quot; (1280), &quot;Or ha-Sekhel&quot;, &quot;Sefer ha-Cheshek&quot;, and &quot;Imrei Shefer&quot; (1291).

Of special importance for understanding his messianology are his &quot;prophetic books&quot; written between 1279 (in Patras) and 1288 (in Messina), in which revelations including apocalyptic imagery and scenes are interpreted as pointing to spiritual processes of inner redemption. The spiritualized understanding of the concepts of messianism and redemption as an intellectual development represents a major contribution of the messianic ideas in Judaism. As part of his messianic propensity, Abulafia become an intense disseminator of his Kabbalah, orally and in written form, trying to convince both Jews and Christians.

In his first treatises, &quot;Get ha-Shemot&quot; and &quot;Maftei’ach ha-Re&#x27;ayon&quot;, Abulafia describes a linguistic type of Kabbalah similar to the early writings of Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla. In his later writings, the founder of prophetic Kabbalah produces a synthesis between Maimonides&#x27; Neoaristotelian understanding of prophecy as the result of the transformation of the intellectual influx into a linguistic message and techniques to reach such experiences by means of combinations of letters and their pronunciation, breathing exercises, contemplation of parts of the body, movements of the head and hands, and concentration exercises. Some of the elements of those techniques stem from commentaries on &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; of Ashkenazi. He called his Kabbalah &quot;the Kabbalah of names,&quot; that is, of divine names, being a way to reach what he called the prophetic experience, or &quot;prophetic Kabbalah,&quot; as the ultimate aims of his way: unitive and revelatory experiences. In his writings expressions of what is known as the &quot;unio mystica&quot; of the human and the supernal intellects may be discerned. Much less concerned with the theosophy of his contemporary kabbalists, who were interested in theories of ten hypostatic sefirot, some of which he described as worse than the Christian belief in the trinity, Abulafia depicted the supernal realm, especially the cosmic Agent Intellect, in linguistic terms, as speech and letters.

In his later books, Abulafia repeatedly elaborated upon a system of seven paths of interpretation, which he used sometimes in his commentary on the &quot;Pentateuch&quot;, which starts with the plain sense, includes also allegorical interpretation, and culminates in interpretations of the discrete letters, the latter conceived of as the path to prophecy. Abulafia developed a sophisticated theory of language, which assumes that Hebrew represents not so much the language as written or spoken as the principles of all languages, namely the ideal sounds and the combinations between them. Thus, Hebrew as an ideal language encompasses all the other languages. This theory of language might have influenced Dante Alighieri. In his writings Abulafia uses Greek, Latin, Italian, Arabic, Tatar, and Basque words for purpose of gematria.

Abulafia&#x27;s Kabbalah inspired a series of writings which can be described as part of his prophetic Kabbalah, namely, as striving to attain extreme forms of mystical experiences. The most important among them are the anonymous &quot;Sefer ha-Tzeruf&quot; (translated into Latin for Pico), &quot;Sefer Ner Elohim&quot;, and &quot;Sefer Shaarei Tzedek&quot; by Rabbi Nathan ben Saadiah Harar, who influenced the Kabbalah of Rabbi Isaac of Acre. The impact of Abulafia is evident in an anonymous epistle attributed to Maimonides; Rabbi Reuven Tzarfati, a kabbalist active in 14th century Italy; Abraham Shalom, Yohanan Alemanno, Judah Albotini, and Joseph ibn Zagyah; Moses Cordovero and Chaim Vital&#x27;s influential &quot;Shaarei Kedushah&quot;; Sabbatai Zevi, Joseph Hamitz, Pinchas Horowitz, and Menahem Mendel of Shklov.

Extant in many manuscripts, Abulafia&#x27;s writings were not printed by kabbalists, most of whom banned his brand of Kabbalah, and only by chance introduced in their writings a few short and anonymous fragments. Scholarship started with an analysis of his manuscript writings by M. H. Landauer, who attributed the book of the &quot;Zohar&quot; to him. Adolf Jellinek refuted this attribution and compiled the first comprehensive list of Abulafia&#x27;s writings, publishing three of Abulafia&#x27;s shorter treatises (two epistles, printed in 1853/4, and Sefer ha-Ot in 1887), while Amnon Gross published 13 volumes, which include most of Abulafia&#x27;s books and those of his students&#x27; books (Jerusalem, 1999–2004). Major contributions to the analysis of Abulafia&#x27;s thought and that of his school have been made by Gershom Scholem, Chaim Wirszubski, Moshe Idel, and Elliot R. Wolfson. Some of Abulafia&#x27;s treatises were translated into Latin and Italian in the circle of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, mostly by Flavius Mithridates, and Pico’s vision of Kabbalah was significantly influenced by his views. This is the case also with Francesco Giogio Veneto&#x27;s &quot;De Harmonia Mundi&quot;.

Abulafia&#x27;s life inspired a series of literary works such as poems by Ivan Goll, Moses Feinstein (not Rabbi Moshe Feinstein) and Nathaniel Tarn; Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot;; and a play by George-Elie Bereby; in art, Abraham Pincas&#x27; paintings and Bruriah Finkel&#x27;s sculptures; and several musical pieces.

Abulafia&#x27;s writings include:
*&quot;Sefer ha-Geulah&quot; (1273), a commentary on &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;
*&quot;Sefer Chayei ha-Nefesh&quot;, a commentary on &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot;

*&quot;Ve-Zot Li-Yehuda&quot; (&quot;And this is for Yehuda&quot;)

===Abulafia&#x27;s meditation techniques===
In his numerous works Abulafia focuses on complex devices for uniting with the Agent Intellect, or God, through the recitation of divine names, together with breathing techniques and cathartic practices. Some of Abulafia’s mystic ways were adapted by the Ashkenazi Hasidim. Taking as his framework the metaphysical and psychological system of Moses Maimonides (1135/8–1204), Abulafia strove for spiritual experience, which he viewed as a prophetic state similar to or even identical with that of the ancient Jewish prophets.

Abulafia suggests a method that is based on a stimulus that continuously changes. His intention is not to relax the consciousness by meditation, but to purify it via a high level of concentration which requires doing many actions at the same time. For this, he uses Hebrew letters.

Abulafia’s method includes a number of steps.
* The first step, preparation: the initiate purifies himself through fasting, the wearing of tefillin, and donning pure white garments.
* The second step: the mystic writes out specific letter groups and their permutations.
* The third step, physiological maneuvers: the mystic chants the letters in conjunction with specific respiratory patterns, as well as head positioning.
* The fourth step, mental imagery of letters and human forms: the mystic imagines a human form, and himself without a body. Then the mystic ‘draws’ the letters mentally, projects them onto the ‘screen’ of the ‘imaginative faculty’, i.e. he mentally imagines the patterns of letters. He then rotates the letters and turns them, as Abulafia describes in Imrei Shefer: &quot;And they [the letters], with their forms, are called the Clear Mirror, for all the forms having brightness and strong radiance are included in them. And one who gazes at them in their forms will discover their secrets and speak to them, and they will speak to him. And they are like an image in which a man sees all his forms standing in front of him, and then he will be able to see all the general and specific things (Ms. Paris BN 777, fol. 49).&quot;

During the final step of mental imagery, the mystic passes a succession of four experiences. The first is an experience of body-photism or illumination, in which light not only surrounds the body but also diffuses into it, giving impression that the body and its organs have become light.
As the ecstatic Kabbalist continues to practice, combining letters and performing physiological maneuvers, the result is the second experience: weakening of the body, in an ‘absorptive’ manner. Subsequently, the mystic may feel an enhancement of his thoughts and imaginative capacity. This is the third experience. The fourth experience is characterized mainly by fear and trembling.

Abulafia emphasizes that trembling is a basic and necessary step to obtain prophecy (Sitrei Torah, Paris Ms. 774, fol. 158a). In another place he writes: ‘all your body will begin to tremble, and your limbs begin to shake, and you will fear a tremendous fear […] and the body will tremble, like the rider who races the horse, who is glad and joyful, while the horse trembles beneath him’
(Otzar Eden Ganuz, Oxford Ms. 1580, fols. 163b-164a; see also Hayei Haolam
Haba, Oxford 1582, fol. 12a).

For Abulafia the fear is followed by an experience of pleasure and delight. This feeling is a result of sensing another ‘spirit’ within his body, as he describes in Otzar Eden Ganuz: ‘And you shall feel another spirit awakening within yourself and strengthening you and passing over your entire body and giving you pleasure’ (Oxford Ms. 1580 fols. 163b-164a).

Only after passing these successive experiences does the mystic reach his goal: the vision of a human form, which is closely linked to his own physical appearance and generally experienced as standing in front of the mystic. The experience is increased when the mystic experiences his autoscopic form (or ‘double’) as speaking: the double begins to talk to the mystic, teaching
him the unknown and revealing the future.

Abraham Abulafia describes the experience of seeing a human ‘form’ many times in his writings. However, initially it is not clear who this ‘form’ is. As the dialog between the mystic and the ‘form’ proceeds, the reader understands that the ‘form’ is the image of the mystic himself. Addressing his students and followers in &quot;Sefer haKheshek&quot;, Abulafia further elaborates the scenario:
Apparently, by utilizing the letters of ‘the Name’ with specific breath techniques, a human form should appear. Only in the last sentence Abulafia suggests that this form is ‘yourself’.

Yet he explicitly put it, as he has also explained in another book, &quot;Sefer haYei haOlam haBa&quot;: &quot;And consider his reply, answering as though you yourself had answered yourself&quot; (Oxford Ms. 1582, fol. 56b). Most of Abulafia’s descriptions are written in a similar fashion. In &quot;Sefer haOt&quot;, Abulafia describes a similar episode, but from an explicit self-perspective:&quot;I saw a man coming from the west with a great army, the number of the warriors of his camp being twenty-two thousand men […] And when I saw his face in the sight, I was astonished, and my heart trembled within me, and I left my place and I longed for it to call upon the name of God to help me, but that thing evaded my spirit. And when the man had seen my great fear and my strong awe, he opened his mouth and he spoke, and he opened my mouth to speak, and I answered him according to his words, and in my words I became another man (pp. 81–2).&quot;

==Influence==
Abulafia&#x27;s subterranean influence is evident in the large number of manuscripts of his major meditation manuals that flourished down to the present day until all his works were finally published in Mea Shearim in Jerusalem during the 1990s.

Abulafia’s prophetic and messianic pretensions prompted a sharp reaction on the part of Shelomoh ben Avraham Adret, a famous legal authority who succeeded in annihilating the influence of Abulafia’s ecstatic Kabbalah in Spain (responsa volume 1 #548)

According to Besserman&#x27;s &quot;The Shambhala Guide to Kabbalah and Jewish Mysticism&quot;, Abulafia&#x27;s &quot;prophetic approach to meditation included manipulating the Hebrew letters in a nondenominational context that brought him into conflict with the Jewish establishment and provoked the Inquisition.&quot;

In Italy, however, his works were translated into Latin and contributed substantially to the formation of Christian Kabbalah.

In the Middle East, ecstatic Kabbalah was accepted without reservation. Clear traces of Abulafian doctrine are evident in the works of Isaac ben Samuel of Acre, Yehudah Albotini and Hayyim ben Joseph Vital. In Israel, Abulafia’s ideas were combined with Sufi elements, apparently stemming from the school of Ibn Arabi; thus Sufi views were introduced into European Kabbalah.

After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, Spanish theurgical Kabbalah, which had developed without any significant influence from ecstatic Kabbalah, was integrated with the latter; this combination became, through the book Pardes Rimmonim by Mosheh Cordovero, part of mainstream Kabbalah. Hayyim Vital brought Abulafian views into the fourth unpublished part of his Shaarei Kedushah, and the eighteenth-century qabalists of the Beit El Academy in Jerusalem perused Abulafia’s mystical manuals. Later on, mystical and psychological conceptions of Kabbalah found their way directly and indirectly to the Polish Hasidic masters. The influence of ecstatic Kabbalah is to be seen in isolated groups today, and traces of it can be found in modern literature (e.g., the poetry of Yvan Goll), mainly since the publication of Gershom Scholem’s researches, and subsequently the groundbreaking studies of Moshe Idel.

<text>Polymer degradation is the reduction in the physical properties of a polymer, such as strength, caused by changes in its chemical composition. Polymers and particularly plastics are subject to degradation at all stages of their product life cycle, including during their initial processing, use, disposal into the environment and recycling. The rate of this degradation varies significantly; biodegradation can take decades, whereas some industrial processes can completely decompose a polymer in hours.

Technologies have been developed to both inhibit or promote degradation. For instance, polymer stabilizers ensure plastic items are produced with the desired properties, extend their useful lifespans, and facilitate their recycling. Conversely, biodegradable additives accelerate the degradation of plastic waste by improving its biodegradability. Some forms of plastic recycling can involve the complete degradation of a polymer back into monomers or other chemicals.

In general, the effects of heat, light, air and water are the most significant factors in the degradation of plastic polymers. The major chemical changes are oxidation and chain scission, leading to a reduction in the molecular weight and degree of polymerization of the polymer. These changes affect physical properties like strength, malleability, melt flow index, appearance and colour. The changes in properties are often termed &quot;aging&quot;.

==Susceptibility== 
Plastics exist in huge variety, however several types of commodity polymer dominate global production: polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET, PETE), polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The degradation of these materials is of primary importance as they account for most plastic waste.

These plastics are all thermoplastics and are more susceptible to degradation than equivalent thermosets, as those are more thoroughly cross-linked. The majority (PP, PE, PVC, PS and PMMA) are addition polymers with all-carbon backbones that are more resistant to most types of degradation. PET and PC are condensation polymers which contain carbonyl groups more susceptible to hydrolysis and UV-attack.

==Degradation during processing==

Thermoplastic polymers (be they virgin or recycled) must be heated until molten to be formed into their final shapes, with processing temperatures anywhere between 150-320 °C (300–600 °F) depending on the polymer. Polymers will oxidise under these conditions, but even in the absence of air, these temperatures are sufficient to cause thermal degradation in some materials. The molten polymer also experiences significant shear stress during extrusion and moulding, which is sufficient to snap the polymer chains. Unlike many other forms of degradation, the effects of melt-processing degrades the entire bulk of the polymer, rather than just the surface layers. This degradation introduces chemical weak points into the polymer, particularly in the form of hydroperoxides, which become initiation sites for further degradation during the object&#x27;s lifetime.

Polymers are often subject to more than one round of melt-processing, which can cumulatively advance degradation. Virgin plastic typically undergoes compounding to introduce additives such as dyes, pigments and stabilisers. Pelletised material prepared in this may also be pre-dried in an oven to remove trace moisture prior to its final melting and moulding into plastic items. Plastic which is recycled by simple re‑melting (mechanical recycling) will usually display more degradation than fresh material and may have poorer properties as a result.

===Thermal oxidation===
Although oxygen levels inside processing equipment are usually low, it cannot be fully excluded and thermal-oxidation will usually take place more readily than degradation that is exclusively thermal (i.e. without air). Reactions follow the general autoxidation mechanism, leading to the formation of organic peroxides and carbonyls. The addition of antioxidants may inhibit such processes.

=== Thermal degradation ===
{{main|Thermal degradation of polymers}}

Heating polymers to a sufficiently high temperature can cause damaging chemical changes, even in the absence of oxygen. This usually starts with chain scission, generating free radicals, which primarily engage in disproportionation and crosslinking. 
PVC is the most thermally sensitive common polymer, with major degradation occurring from ~{{convert|250|C|round=5}} onwards; other polymers degrade at higher temperatures.

===Thermo-mechanical degradation===
Molten polymers are non-Newtonian fluids with high viscosities, and the interaction between their thermal and mechanical degradation can be complex. At low temperatures, the polymer-melt is more viscous and more prone to mechanical degradation via shear stress. At higher temperatures, the viscosity is reduced, but thermal degradation is increased. Friction at points of high sheer can also cause localised heating, leading to additional thermal degradation.

Mechanical degradation can be reduced by the addition of lubricants, also referred to as processing aids or flow aids. These can reduce friction against the processing machinery but also between polymer chains, resulting in a decrease in melt-viscosity. Common agents are high-molecular-weight waxes (paraffin wax, wax esters, etc.) or metal stearates (i.e.zinc stearate).

== In-service degradation ==
Most plastic items, like packaging materials, are used briefly and only once. These rarely experience polymer degradation during their service-lives. Other items experience only gradual degradation from the natural environment. Some plastic items, however, can experience long service-lives in aggressive environments, particularly those where they are subject to prolonged heat or chemical attack. Polymer degradation can be significant in these cases and, in practice, is often only held back by the use of advanced polymer stabilizers. Degradation arising from the effects of heat, light, air and water is the most common, but other means of degradation exist.

The in-service degradation of mechanical properties is an important aspect which limits the applications of these materials. Polymer degradation caused by in-service degradation can cause life threatening accidents. In 1996, a baby was fed via a Hickman line and suffered an infection, when new connectors were used by a hospital. The reason behind this infection was the cracking and erosion of the pipes from the inner side due to contact with liquid media.

=== Chlorine-induced cracking ===
Drinking water which has been chlorinated to kill microbes may contain trace levels of chlorine. The World Health Organization recommends an upper limit of 5 ppm.
Although low, 5 ppm is enough to slowly attack certain types of plastic, particularly when the water is heated, as it is for washing.
Polyethylene, polybutylene and acetal resin (polyoxymethylene) pipework and fittings are all susceptible. Attack leads to hardening of pipework, which can leave it brittle and more susceptible to mechanical failure.

=== Electronics ===
Plastics are used extensively in the manufacture of electrical items, such as circuit boards and electrical cables. These applications can be harsh, exposing the plastic to a mixture of thermal, chemical and electrochemical attack. Many electric items like transformers, microprocessors or high-voltage cables operate at elevated temperatures for years, or even decades, resulting in low-level but continuous thermal oxidation. This can be exacerbated by direct contact with metals, which can promote the formation of free-radicals, for instance, by the action of Fenton reactions on hydroperoxides. High voltage loads can also damage insulating materials such as dielectrics, which degrade via electrical treeing caused by prolonged electrical field stress.

=== Galvanic action ===

Polymer degradation by galvanic action was first described in the technical literature in 1990 by Michael C. Faudree, an employee at General Dynamics, Fort Worth Division. The phenomenon has been referred to as the &quot;Faudree Effect&quot;, and can possibly be used as a sustainable process to degrade non-recyclable thermoset plastics, and also has had implications for preventing corrosion on aircraft for safety such as changes in design. When carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer is attached to a metal surface, the carbon fiber can act as a cathode if exposed to water or sufficient humidity, resulting in galvanic corrosion. This has been seen in engineering when carbon-fiber polymers have been used to reinforce weakened steel structures. Reactions have also been seen in aluminium and magnesium alloys, polymers affected include bismaleimides (BMI), and polyimides. The mechanism of degradation is believed to involve the electrochemical generation of hydroxide ions, which then cleave the amide bonds.

==Degradation in the environment==
Most plastics do not biodegrade readily, however, they do still degrade in the environment because of the effects of UV-light, oxygen, water and pollutants. This combination is often generalised as polymer weathering. Chain breaking by weathering causes increasing embrittlement of plastic items, which eventually causes them to break apart. Fragmentation then continues until eventually microplastics are formed. As the particle sizes get smaller, so their combined surface area increases. This facilitates the leaching of additives out of plastic and into the environment. Many controversies associated with plastics actually relate to these additives.

=== Photo-oxidation ===
{{main|Photo-oxidation of polymers}}
Photo-oxidation is the combined action of UV-light and oxygen and is the most significant factor in the weathering of plastics. Although many polymers do not absorb UV-light, they often contain impurities like hydroperoxide and carbonyl groups introduced during thermal processing, which do. These act as photoinitiators to give complex free radical chain reactions where the mechanisms of autoxidation and photodegradation combine. Photo-oxidation can be held back by light stabilizers such as hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS).

=== Hydrolysis ===
Polymers with an all-carbon backbone, such as polyolefins, are usually resistant to hydrolysis. Condensation polymers like polyesters, polyamides, polyurethanes and polycarbonates can be degraded by hydrolysis of their carbonyl groups, to give lower molecular weight molecules. Such reactions are exceedingly slow at ambient temperatures, however, they remain a significant source of degradation for these materials, particularly in the marine environment. Swelling caused by the absorption of minute amounts of water can also cause environmental stress cracking, which accelerates degradation.

=== Ozonolysis of rubbers===
{{main|Ozonolysis|Ozone cracking}}

Polymers, which are not fully saturated, are vulnerable to attack by ozone. This gas exists naturally in the atmosphere but is also formed by nitrogen oxides released in vehicle exhaust pollution. Many common elastomers (rubbers) are affected, with natural rubber, polybutadiene, styrene-butadiene rubber and NBR being most sensitive to degradation. The ozonolysis reaction results in immediate chain scission. Ozone cracks in products under tension are always oriented at right angles to the strain axis, so will form around the circumference in a rubber tube bent over. Such cracks are dangerous when they occur in fuel pipes because the cracks will grow from the outside exposed surfaces into the bore of the pipe, and fuel leakage and fire may follow. The problem of ozone cracking can be prevented by adding antiozonants.

=== Biological degradation ===
{{main|Synthetic biodegradable polymer|Biodegradable plastic|Biodegradable polymer|Plastic degradation by marine bacteria}}

The major appeal of biodegradation is that, in theory, the polymer will be completely consumed in the environment without needing complex waste management and that the products of this will be non-toxic. 
Most common plastics biodegrade very slowly, sometimes to the extent that they are considered non-biodegradable. As polymers are ordinarily too large to be absorbed by microbes, biodegradation initially relies on secreted extracellular enzymes to reduce the polymers to manageable chain-lengths. This requires the polymers bear functional groups the enzymes can &#x27;recognise&#x27;, such as ester or amide groups. Long-chain polymers with all-carbon backbones like polyolefins, polystyrene and PVC will not degrade by biological action alone and must first be oxidised to create chemical groups which the enzymes can attack.

Oxidation can be caused by melt-processing or weathering in the environment. Oxidation may be intentionally accelerated by the addition of biodegradable additives. These are added to the polymer during compounding to improve the biodegradation of otherwise very resistant plastics. Similarly, biodegradable plastics have been designed which are intrinsically biodegradable, provided they are treated like compost and not just left in a landfill site where degradation is very difficult because of the lack of oxygen and moisture.

==Degradation during recycling==

{{Main|Plastic recycling}}

The act of recycling plastic degrades its polymer chains, usually as a result of thermal damage similar to that seen during initial processing. In some cases, this is turned into an advantage by intentionally and completely depolymerising the plastic back into its starting monomers, which can then be used to generate fresh, un-degraded plastic. In theory, this chemical (or feedstock) recycling offers infinite recyclability, but it is also more expensive and can have a higher carbon footprint because of its energy costs. Mechanical recycling, where the plastic is simply remelted and reformed, is more common, although this usually results in a lower-quality product. Alternatively, plastic may simply be burnt as a fuel in a waste-to-energy process.

===Remelting===
Thermoplastic polymers like polyolefins can be remelted and reformed into new items. This approach is referred to as mechanical recycling and is usually the simplest and most economical form of recovery. Post-consumer plastic will usually already bear a degree of degradation. Another round of melt-processing will exacerbate this, with the result being that mechanically recycled plastic will usually have poorer mechanical properties than virgin plastic. Degradation can be enhanced by high concentrations of hydroperoxides, cross-contamination between different types of plastic and by additives present within the plastic. Technologies developed to enhance the biodegradation of plastic can also conflict with its recycling, with oxo-biodegradable additives, consisting of metallic salts of iron, magnesium, nickel, and cobalt, increasing the rate of thermal degradation. Depending on the polymer in question, an amount of virgin material may be added to maintain the quality of the product.

===Thermal depolymerisation &amp; pyrolysis===
{{main|Thermal depolymerization}}

As polymers approach their ceiling temperature, thermal degradation gives way to complete decomposition. Certain polymers like PTFE, polystyrene and PMMA undergo depolymerization to give their starting monomers, whereas others like polyethylene undergo pyrolysis, with random chain scission giving a mixture of volatile products. Where monomers are obtained, they can be converted back into new plastic (chemical or feedstock recycling), whereas pyrolysis products are used as a type of synthetic fuel (energy recycling). In practice, even very efficient depolymerisation to monomers tends to see some competitive pyrolysis. Thermoset polymers may also be converted in this way, for instance, in tyre recycling.

===Chemical depolymerisation===
Condensation polymers baring cleavable groups such as esters and amides can also be completely depolymerised by hydrolysis or solvolysis. This can be a purely chemical process but may also be promoted by enzymes. Such technologies are less well developed than those of thermal depolymerisation, but have the potential for lower energy costs. Thus far, polyethylene terephthalate has been the most heavily studied polymer. Alternatively, waste plastic may be converted into other valuable chemicals (not necessarily monomers) by microbial action.

==Stabilisers==
{{main|Polymer stabilizers}}
Hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) stabilise against weathering by scavenging free radicals that are produced by photo-oxidation of the polymer matrix. UV-absorbers stabilise against weathering by absorbing ultraviolet light and converting it into heat. Antioxidants stabilise the polymer by terminating the chain reaction because of the absorption of UV light from sunlight. The chain reaction initiated by photo-oxidation leads to cessation of crosslinking of the polymers and degradation of the property of polymers. Antioxidants are used to protect from thermal degradation.

==Detection==
Degradation can be detected before serious cracks are seen in a product using infrared spectroscopy. In particular, peroxy-species and carbonyl groups formed by photo-oxidation have distinct absorption bands.

<doc id="530824" wikidata="Q1772113" url="?curid=530824" title="Fred Kavli">
<text>Fred Kavli (August 20, 1927 – November 21, 2013) was a Norwegian-American businessman and philanthropist. He was born on a small farm in Eresfjord, Norway. He founded the Kavlico Corporation, located in Moorpark, California. Under his leadership, the company became one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of sensors for aeronautic, automotive, and industrial applications supplying General Electric and the Ford Motor Company.

In 2000 he established The Kavli Foundation to &quot;advance science for the benefit of humanity and to promote public understanding and support for scientists and their work&quot;. The Foundation&#x27;s mission is implemented through an international program of research institutes, professorships, and symposia in the scientific fields of astrophysics, nanoscience, neuroscience, and theoretical physics. The foundation awards the Kavli Prize in astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience.

He was featured in the media primarily for his philanthropic efforts.

==Kavli&#x27;s life==
Born in 1927, Kavli grew up on the family farm in the Norwegian village of Eresfjord (pop. 450).

At 14, together with his brother Aslak, he began his first enterprise creating wood pellet fuel for cars. This was during the Second World War and the Nazi occupation of Norway.

Inspired by his father&#x27;s 13 years in San Francisco the young Kavli wanted to move to the US. Three days after he received his engineering degree from the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim he left for America on the .

Having no job or sponsor waiting for him, his visa application was initially rejected, and so in 1955 he immigrated to Montreal, Quebec, Canada instead. The following year his visa was approved and he moved to the United States. He found work as an engineer for a Los Angeles business that developed feedback flight controls for Atlas missiles. He would rise to the position of Chief Engineer here.

Looking to start his own business he advertised in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; newspaper soliciting financial backers with the simple but effective text &quot;Engineer seeking financial backing to start own business&quot;. 
Two years later he founded the Kavlico Corporation, located in Moorpark, California. Under his leadership, the company became one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of sensors for aeronautic, automotive, and industrial applications supplying amongst others General Electric and the Ford Motor Company.

In 2000, he sold Kavlico for $345 million to C-Mac Industries Inc. Kavlico is today owned by the French company Schneider Electric. Much of Kavli&#x27;s wealth is a result of his real estate investments in Southern California. As a philanthropist, Kavli subsequently established The Kavli Foundation and dedicated much of his wealth to funding research institutions and programs worldwide.

On June 19, 2006, he was appointed Grand Officer, Commander with Star, of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit by King Harald V of Norway in recognition of his work on behalf of Norway and humanity. In 2008, he was also awarded an honorary doctorate, Doctor Honoris Causa, by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, in recognition of his work to the benefit and advancement of science and research.

Kavli was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also a former member of the U.S. President&#x27;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, and former member of the University of California President&#x27;s Board on Science and Innovation.

In 2009, Mr. Kavli received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Northwestern University. In 2011, he received the Bower Award for Business Leadership from the Franklin Institute, one of the oldest science education centers in the United States, and the Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy, which is given biennially to one or more individuals who, like Andrew Carnegie, have dedicated their private wealth to the public good, and who have sustained impressive careers as philanthropists. Also, in 2011, Mr. Kavli was conferred the degree of &quot;doctor philosopliae honoris causa&quot; by the University of Oslo.

A Trustee of the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) Foundation, in addition to supporting scientific research and education, his philanthropic activities include the Fred Kavli Theatre for Performing Arts at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, California, as well as other projects. He was divorced and had two grown children.

On November 21, 2013, Kavli died at his Santa Barbara, California home after surgery for cholangiocarcinoma, a rare form of cancer.

==Kavli Prizes==

Through The Kavli Foundation, Kavli established scientific prizes in the fields of Astrophysics, Nanoscience, and Neuroscience. The Kavli Prizes are presented in cooperation with the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research, and have been awarded biennially at a ceremony in Oslo since 2008. Each prize consists of a scroll, gold medal, and $1,000,000 cash.

Kavli chose to focus on these three areas of interest – &quot;from the biggest, to the smallest, to the most complex&quot; – because he thinks these fields are the most exciting scientific fields for the 21st century with potentially great benefits. Kavli has also noted his intent that the Prizes distinguish themselves from the Nobel prizes in science. Consequently, one key distinction between the prizes: Kavli Prize laureates are selected by committees composed of distinguished international scientists. These committee members are recommended by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the French Academy of Sciences, the Max Planck Society, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and The Royal Society, with committee chairs chosen by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

The first Kavli Prize winners were announced on May 28, 2008, simultaneously in Oslo and at the opening of the World Science Festival in New York City. The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden-Bell. Louis E. Brus and Sumio Iijima shared the nanoscience prize, while Pasko Rakic, Thomas Jessell and Sten Grillner were awarded the neuroscience prize. The four US winners of the Kavli Prize were honored by President George W. Bush and Science Advisor, Dr. John Marburger, at an Oval Office reception in the White House on November 12, 2008. (See Kavli Prize for laureates in subsequent years.)

==The Kavli Foundation==
The Kavli Foundation, based in Oxnard, California, is dedicated to the goals of advancing science for the benefit of humanity and to promote public understanding and support for scientists and their work. It was established in 2000 by Mr. Kavli and is actively involved in establishing major research institutes at leading universities and institutions in the United States, Europe and Asia.

The Kavli Foundation has made grants to establish Kavli Institutes on the campuses of the University of California, Santa Barbara, University of California Berkeley, Stanford University, California Institute of Technology, the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Yale University, New York University, Cornell University, the University of California, San Diego, Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Peking University, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Harvard University, University of Cambridge and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. These institutions are the beneficiaries of the Kavli Foundation to date, and the list is bound to grow in the future.

In addition to the Kavli Institutes, six Kavli professorships have been established: two at the University of California Santa Barbara, one at the University of California Los Angeles, one at the University of California Irvine, one at Columbia University, and one at the California Institute of Technology.

==Kavli Institutes==

The Kavli Foundation has established 20 research institutes at leading universities worldwide. These institutes focus on astrophysics, nanoscience, neuroscience and theoretical physics. Consistent with its business-like approach, Kavli requires each partner University to match the average $7.5 million donation. The institutes are not required to focus on any specific subject but are free to do any basic research they see fit.

Seven researchers associated with the Kavli institutes have been awarded Nobel Prizes: David Gross, Frank Wilczek, Richard Axel, Eric Kandel, Edvard Moser, May-Britt Moser and Rainer Weiss.

As of October 2023, there are 13 institutes in the United States, 2 in China, 1 in the Netherlands, 1 in Norway, 2 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in Japan.

<text>Norman Kempton Atkins (June 27, 1934 – September 28, 2010) was a Canadian Senator and a political figure in Canada.

Born in Montclair, New Jersey, Atkins was a graduate of Appleby College in Oakville and of Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, where he completed the Bachelor of Arts program in 1957. He subsequently received an Honorary Doctorate in Civil Law in 2000, from Acadia University.

Atkins was a leading figure in advertising and a senior Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and Progressive Conservative Party of Canada strategist. He was especially associated with the Big Blue Machine, which helped elect the Ontario PC Party under Bill Davis. In the 1980s, he was a strategist for the federal Conservatives, led by Brian Mulroney, who recommended him to Governor General Jeanne Sauvé for appointment to the Senate in 1986.

Atkins opposed the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party with the Canadian Alliance, and refused to join the product of that merger, the Conservative Party of Canada. Instead, he continued to sit in the Senate as a &quot;Progressive Conservative&quot; along with Lowell Murray and Elaine McCoy. He did not initially rule out joining the new Conservative Party caucus in the future, saying in February 2004, &quot;I will be watching with interest, both the Leadership and the policies of the new party, to see whether they address my concerns. It is my hope that they will reflect the values and beliefs Progressive Conservatives hold so strongly&quot;. However, he continued to sit as a Progressive Conservative for the duration of his time in the Senate.

On February 27, 2007, Atkins was elected vice-chairman of the Senate&#x27;s National Security and Defence Committee. He was elected with the support of defiant Liberal senators after moderate Conservative Senator Michael Meighen resigned his position at the direction of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office who reportedly wished to install a more ideologically conservative co-chair.

Atkins retired from the Senate upon turning 75 on June 27, 2009. He died in Fredericton on September 28, 2010, at the age of 76.

<text>Julio &quot;Julito&quot; Collazo (1925 – March 5, 2004) was a master percussionist.

Collazo was born in Havana, Cuba. He began playing the ritual music of Santería on the batá drums at the age of fifteen. He moved to United States in the 1950s to join in a world tour with the Afroamerican dancer Katherine Dunham and her Dance Company. Julito Collazo is one of a handful of Cuban percussionists who came to the United States in the 1940s and 1950s. Other notable Cuban percussionists who came to the U.S. during that time include Luciano &quot;Chano&quot; Pozo, Mongo Santamaría, Armando Peraza, Francisco Aguabella, Candido Camero, Carlos Vidal Bolado and &quot;Modesto Durán&quot;. In the United States Collazo rose to prominence recording and performing with Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, Mongo Santamaría, Silvestre Méndez, Dizzy Gillespie and Machito, among others. These collaborations were magisterial and provide motivation and feedback for researchers, and assure the relevance of the research to the goal of improving the performance of batá drums. Collazo died in New York City of undisclosed causes at age 78.

<text>Mestwin I ( or , ; c. 1160 – 1/2 May 1219 or 1220) was Prince of Pomerelia (styled himself as &quot;princeps Pomoranorum&quot;) from about 1205 until his death.

Mestwin was a member of the Samborides dynasty, the son of Duke Sobiesław of Gdańsk and younger brother of Sambor I, whom he succeeded in Pomerelia. In the tables of Oliwa Abbey, outside Gdańsk, he is recorded as &quot;pacificus&quot; (&quot;the Peaceful&quot;). 

As Mestwin I, &quot;dei gracia princeps in Gdanzk&quot;, he had founded a convent of nuns (probably the Premonstratensian abbey of Żukowo), the castellany of Białogarda at the border with the Pomeranian Lands of Schlawe and Stolp on the Łeba river, and several villages between the rivers Radunia and Słupia. After King Valdemar II of Denmark had conquered the southern coast of the Baltic Sea with &quot;Gdanzk&quot; during a crusade against the Old Prussians, Duke Mestwin in 1210 had to accept Danish overlordship, but was able to free himself again the next year. 

He was married to Swinisława (d. 1240), formerly referred to as a daughter of Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania. They had eight children:
# Hedwig, married Duke Władysław Odonic of Greater Poland
# Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania, succeeded his father as Duke of Pomerelia, from 1227 of Pomerelia-Gdańsk
# Mirosława, married Bogislaw II, Duke of Pomerania at Stettin
# Witosława, prioress of Żukowo Abbey
# Warcisław, Duke at Świecie from 1227
# Sambor II, Duke at Lubiszewo from 1233
# Ratibor, Duke at Białogard from 1233
# Milosława, nun at Żukowo Abbey

<text>Timex Group USA, Inc. (formerly known as Timex Corporation) is an American global watch manufacturing company founded in 1854 as the Waterbury Clock Company in Waterbury, Connecticut. In 1944, the company became insolvent but was reformed into Timex Corporation. In 2008, the company was acquired by Timex Group B.V. and was renamed Timex Group USA.

Thomas Olsen purchased the Waterbury Clock Company in New York in 1941 and renamed it &quot;Timex&quot;, a portmanteau of the names of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and Kleenex.

== History ==

=== Waterbury Clock Company (1854–1944) ===

Brass manufacturer Benedict &amp; Burnham created Waterbury Clock Company in 1854 to manufacture clocks using brass wheels and gears. Waterbury Clock Company was legally incorporated on March 27, 1857, as an independent business with $60,000 in capital. The American clock industry was producing millions of clocks with scores of companies located in Connecticut&#x27;s Naugatuck River Valley, earning the region the nickname &quot;Switzerland of America&quot;. The Waterbury Clock Company was one of the largest producers for both domestic sales and export, primarily to Europe.

==== Ingersoll Watch Company ====

The company originally produced clocks as less expensive alternatives to the high-end European counterparts of the time. In 1887, they introduced the large &quot;Jumbo&quot; pocket watch, invented by Archibald Bannatyne and named after the famous P. T. Barnum elephant. The &quot;Jumbo&quot; was put on the market in New York City on a trial basis, catching the attention of Robert H. Ingersoll, a salesman and eventual marketing pioneer. During the turn of the century, Waterbury Clock Company produced millions of pocket watches for the Robert H. Ingersoll &amp; Bro. watch company, in which Robert partnered with his brother Charles. In 1896, Ingersoll introduced the &quot;Ingersoll Yankee&quot;, a dollar pocket watch supplied by Waterbury Clock Company. These watches gained such great popularity that they became known as &quot;the watch that made the dollar famous.&quot;

==== Waterbury Watch Company ====

In 1877, a new prototype was introduced to Benedict and Burnham for an inexpensive pocket watch made of 58 parts, mostly punched sheet brass. They immediately set aside an unused portion of their machine shop and began producing the &quot;Long Wind&quot; at a rate of 200 per day by 1878. The department quickly outgrew its space in the plant, so Benedict &amp; Burnham incorporated Waterbury Clock&#x27;s sister company Waterbury Watch Company in 1880 with a capital of $400,000 to manufacture and sell inexpensive watches and other timepieces. Waterbury Watch started out very successfully in its early days, employing hundreds of women for their &quot;slender fingers&quot; and &quot;delicate manipulation&quot;, and it became the largest-volume producer of watches in the world by 1888.

Waterbury Watch quickly fell into bankruptcy, however, due to poor sales techniques where &quot;jobbers&quot; and salesmen gave away much of the product as loss leaders with little regard to the company&#x27;s future, thereby cheapening the products&#x27; perceived value. In a last attempt to salvage the company, Waterbury Watch began to produce higher-end watch models which only created more demand on a workforce unable to keep up with the complexity of the new watches using several hundred parts. The company was finally reorganized as the New England Watch Company in 1898, as its London sales office was placed into liquidation. The company continued to focus on high-priced watch models and eventually fell into receivership, discontinuing business in July 1912. Robert H. Ingersoll &amp; Bro. bought the Waterbury plant and began manufacturing Ingersoll Watches there in 1914.

==== Advent of the wristwatch ====

World War I brought new demands for timepiece design; artillery gunners, for example, needed an easy way to calculate and read time while still being able to work the guns. The Waterbury Clock Company met this need by modifying their small Ingersoll ladies&#x27; &quot;Midget&quot; pocket watch. They added lugs for a canvas strap, repositioned the crown to 3 o&#x27;clock, and made the hands and numbers luminescent for nighttime readability, thus producing one of the first wristwatches.

In 1922, Waterbury Clock Company purchased the Robert H. Ingersoll &amp; Bro. company for $1.5 million. The firm had gone bankrupt the previous year due to the post-war recession. However, Waterbury Clock was unable to deliver on Ingersoll&#x27;s guarantee of quality in Europe due to the Great Depression, so they sold the London-based Ingersoll, Ltd. to its board of directors in 1930, making it a wholly British-owned enterprise. The Ingersoll brand name was continued in the United States by Waterbury Clock into the 1950s, while Ingersoll Ltd. produced the Ingersoll watch brand independently for the European and other markets.

Waterbury Clock Company regained its identity in the consumer market after the Great Depression and a period of hardship. They reached a license agreement with Walt Disney in 1930 to produce the famous Mickey Mouse watches and clocks under the Ingersoll brand name. They introduced the Mickey Mouse timepieces to the public at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in June 1933, and they quickly became the company&#x27;s first million-dollar line, saving it from financial disaster.

Thomas Olsen was the owner of Fred. Olsen Shipping Co., and he fled Norway in 1940 together with Joakim Lehmkuhl and their families because of the Nazi invasion. They eventually came to the United States seeking investments to assist in the war effort. Olsen and Lehmkuhl purchased controlling interest in Waterbury Clock Company in 1941, and Olsen became chairman. Olson appointed Lehmkuhl president, who had studied business and engineering at Harvard and MIT, and the company became the largest producer of fuse timers for precision defense products in the United States under his direction. They built a new concrete plant in nearby Middlebury, Connecticut in 88 days in 1942 for the high-volume production of precision timers. In August 1943, the Under-Secretary of War awarded the Waterbury Clock Company the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award for excellence for their &quot;Anglo-American fuse&quot;, and shareholders voted the following December to rename the company United States Time Corporation.

=== United States Time Corporation (1944–1969 )===
Sales declined after the Korean War in the 1950s because of diminishing defense orders, and United States Time president Lehmkuhl was convinced that an inexpensive watch would be a market success if it was both accurate and durable. He felt that low cost could be accomplished through the combination of automation, the precision tooling techniques used in making fuse timers, and a simpler design than that of higher-priced Swiss watches. Durability was accomplished through a new hard alloy called &quot;Armalloy&quot;, developed through wartime research. &quot;Armalloy&quot; was used to produce longwearing bearings, replacing the expensive jewels traditionally used in a watch&#x27;s movement. These innovations led to the debut of the Timex brand in 1950, though the name was first used on a small trial shipment of nurses&#x27; watches in 1945.

US Time Corporation bought Lacher &amp; Co. AG in Pforzheim, Germany (the Laco brand), on February 1, 1959, in order to acquire the electric watch technology which that company had developed. They also purchased the DUROWE (Deutsche Uhrenrohwerke) brand. Timex sold Durowe to the Swiss movement manufacturer ETA SA on September 1, 1965.

==== Slogan: World&#x27;s largest manufacturer of watches and mechanical time fuses ====
The company manufactured mechanical components for missiles during the boom of American missile development in the late 1950s, including fuses, gyroscope, accelerometers, guidance sub-system, and various other miniature precision items. The company promoted its products under the claim of being the &quot;&quot;world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of watches and mechanical time fuses&quot;.&quot;

The company also produced ammunition components, and repaired, installed, and reactivated government-owned production equipment. The height of the company&#x27;s ordnance and ammunition business lasted through the Vietnam era in the 1960s and 1970s, during which it operated Joliet Army Ammunition Plant as well as privately owned plants and storage facilities.

==== Slogan: It takes a licking and keeps on ticking ====

John Cameron Swayze was widely viewed as the most credible newsman in the United States, so Lehmkuhl decided to hire him as a company spokesman for live &quot;torture tests&quot; on television using Russ Alben&#x27;s slogan &quot;Timex – Takes a Licking and keeps on Ticking&quot;. Hirshon Garfield developed these commercials as elaborations on tests suggested by United States Time Corporation salesmen. The commercials included high-divers, water skiers, a dolphin, dishwashers, jackhammers, paint mixers, and the propeller of an outboard motor, each torturing a Timex watch.

Consumer demand increased for the watches, despite resistance from jewelers because of the low 50% markup, and Timex opened new distribution channels including department stores, cigar stands, drug stores, and other mass-market outlets. By 1962, the Timex brand held the number one market share position in the United States, where one out of every three watches sold was a Timex. Foreign markets were added with company sales offices in Canada, Mexico, France, Great Britain, Germany, and Portugal, as well as distributors in about 20 other countries. Plants were built in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

Edwin H. Land, co-founder of Polaroid Corporation, contacted United States Time Corporation in 1948 in search of a manufacturer for his cameras. A strong relationship was forged between the companies in 1950 resulting in United States Time becoming the exclusive manufacturer of all Polaroid cameras worldwide through the 1970s, totaling more than 44 million cameras. United States Time Corporation was renamed Timex Corporation on July 1, 1969.

=== Timex Corporation (1969–2008) ===
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American watch and clock industry was devastated by the arrival of cheap mechanical watches from the Far East, as well as the development of digital quartz watches pioneered by Japanese companies. Lehmkuhl retired in 1973 with no clear successor, and Polaroid ended its contract with Timex in 1975, resulting in a layoff of 2,000 employees. New technology was developing rapidly in the form of electronic digital watches and quartz analog watches, making Timex&#x27;s mechanical watchmaking production facilities obsolete. Timex closed and consolidated worldwide operations, cutting the 30,000 employee workforce to 6,000. New competitors were aggressively entering the business, including Japanese companies, low-cost Hong Kong producers, and large American companies such as Gillette, Texas Instruments, and National Semi-Conductor. The Disney license had expired and John Cameron Swayze retired from his role as spokesman. The sub-contracting business was rebuilt with new customers such as IBM, Hugin-Sweda, and General Electric. The company entered the home computer business in a joint venture with Sinclair Research Ltd. named Timex Sinclair, selling computers as the Timex Sinclair 1000 and succeeding machines, modeled on the ZX81 and ZX Spectrum. They faced declining sales amid a price war with Commodore Business Machines in 1984 and decided not to compete in that market any longer.

In the mid-1980s, Timex abandoned its development of various consumer products and refocused efforts specifically on timepieces. Product quality and fashionable design became essential to success in the mass market. Timex had a solid reputation for durable products, and the company put increased efforts behind quality improvement. Longer battery life, more durable gold plating, greater accuracy, and more water-resistant styles were some of the many improvements that they implemented. They created new quartz analog movements using fewer components, reducing overall production time and costs. Top athletes assisted in the design of sports watches for specific sports, which led to the introduction of the Ironman Triathlon in 1986 which was named for the Hawaiian triathlon that the company had sponsored since 1984, and it became the most successful Timex watch in the post-mechanical watch era. Within its first year, Timex Ironman became the best-selling watch in the United States, and the world&#x27;s largest selling sport watch for the next decade.

Timex introduced the Indiglo night light during the Christmas shopping season in 1992. Indiglo made headlines as a result of the February 26, 1993 World Trade Center bombing, in which an office worker wearing a Timex with an Indiglo night light used its light to guide a group of evacuees down 40 dark flights of stairs. This caused sales to immediately take off and led to an increase in Timex&#x27;s American market share.

Timex Corporation acquired Callanen International in 1991, the producer of Guess Watches, as part of its &quot;multi-brand strategy&quot;. Timex and Disney reunited in 1993 to produce a new line of character watches called &quot;Disney Classics Collection&quot;. Also in 1993, the Timex Factory at Dundee in the UK, was the site of a major industrial strike. In 1994, Timex acquired the Nautica Watches license and introduced Timex Data Link. The Data Link PDA-type watch could receive contact and scheduling information from a sequence in a computer monitor&#x27;s light using software developed with Microsoft. They introduced the Timex Expedition brand in 1997, designed for rugged outdoor sports. Timex and Motorola introduced Beepwear in 1998, a watch with an integrated pager.

The new millennium led to further growth of Timex Corporation and its parent Timex Group B.V., by way of brand acquisition, brand introduction, and licensing partnerships. In 2000, Timex Corporation purchased the French fashion watch brand Opex. Under its Callanen subsidiary, Timex acquired the watch license for urban fashion designer Marc Eckō in 2002. The company entered the luxury market in 2005 when Timex&#x27;s parent company acquired Swiss-based Vertime SA. Vertime is responsible for the design, manufacturing, and distribution of Swiss-made watches and jewelry for the Versace and Versus brands. Timex USA&#x27;s international holding company the Timex Group launched the TX Watch Company in late 2006. In 2007, Timex Group B.V. established Sequel AG as a separate company devoted to the design, manufacture, and distribution of the Guess and the Swiss-made Gc watch brands. Timex Group B.V. purchased the Italian design studio Giorgio Galli Design Lab in 2007.

===Timex Group USA, Inc. (2008–present)===

The company was restructured in early 2008, establishing the Timex Business Unit as a separate business function for the Timex brand with its own president. Previous Timex Group CEOs had managed the Timex Group and brand, which had contributed to the brand&#x27;s lower earnings in the previous five years. Timex Group&#x27;s Sequel division houses the Guess collections and had grown tremendously to rival Timex as the firm&#x27;s top earner, but the signature brand had been flat as of August 2008. Since this change, Timex has introduced GPS enabled watches, heart rate monitor exercise watches, and similar devices.

In 2008, Timex Group USA signed a four-year agreement making Timex the first official timekeeper of the New York City Marathon. Meanwhile, parent company Timex Group B.V. launched Swiss-made luxury watch brands Salvatore Ferragamo Timepieces and Valentino Timeless under the Timex Group Luxury Watches business. That same year, they began construction on the second-largest ground-mounted solar array in the United States at Timex Group USA&#x27;s headquarters in Middlebury, Connecticut. They inaugurated the 800-panel solar array on February 5, 2009, during a press event held at the headquarters. A few months later, Timex Group USA purchased the Marc Eckō watch trademark which it had licensed since 2002. The Callanen International business unit merged with the Timex Business Unit in 2009, bringing the Timex, Opex, TX, Nautica, and Marc Eckō brands under one company.

== Timex Group B.V. ==

Timex Group B.V., a Dutch holding company, is the corporate parent of several watchmaking companies around the globe including Timex Group USA, Inc. Businesses and exclusive worldwide licenses include the Timex Business Unit (Timex, Timex Ironman, Opex, Nautica, Marc Eckō), Sequel (Guess, Gc), Timex Group Luxury Division (Versace, Versus, Salvatore Ferragamo, Vincent Bérard, CT Scuderia and Teslar) and Giorgio Galli Design Lab.

Today, Timex Group B.V.&#x27;s products are manufactured in the Far East, and in Switzerland, often based on technology that continues to be developed in the United States and in Germany. The group has operations in a number of countries in Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Many Timex Far East operation wristwatches are manufactured by TMX Philippines Inc. in Lapu-Lapu, Philippines. Timex Group B.V.&#x27;s export from the factory in the Philippines is made through their own company. Tmx Limited N.V., based in Curaçao.

<text>Lindholm Høje (Lindholm Hills, from Old Norse &quot;haugr&quot;, hill or mound) is a major Viking burial site and former settlement situated to the north of and overlooking the city of Aalborg in Denmark.

== About the area ==
The southern (lower) part of Lindholm Høje dates to 1000 – 1050 AD, the Viking Age, while the northern (higher) part is significantly earlier, dating back to the 5th century AD in the Nordic Iron Age. An unknown number of rocks have been removed from the site over the centuries, many, for example, being broken up in the 19th century for use in road constructions. The Viking Age part of the burial ground has suffered more from this than the older parts. The first major archaeological excavation, which ultimately included 589 of the approximately 700 graves, began in 1952, although excavations had been conducted as early as 1889.

Remains of villages has been found. The settlement is at an important crossing over the Limfjord, a stretch of water which divides the Jutland peninsula. During the Viking Age, it was only possible to make the crossing at this point or much further west along the fjord at Aggersund, because of the swamps which then edged the fjord on either side.

The settlement was abandoned in approximately 1200 AD, probably due to sand drifting from the western coast, which was a consequence of extensive deforestation and the exposed sand then being blown inland by the rough westerly winds. The sand which covered the site served to protect it in large part over the intervening centuries.
Because of its location and transportation links, the settlement was obviously a significant centre for trade at the time, and this is borne out by glassware, gems and Arab coins found at the site. An 11th-century silver Urnes style brooch found in one grave is the model for bronze copies that were being cast in a Lund jeweler&#x27;s workshop in the early 12th century.

The majority of the burials discovered were cremations, although a number of inhumations were also discovered, and it appeared that the tendency towards cremation or burial depended upon the period, cremation supplanting inhumation in the Viking Age. The pre-Viking Age burials were under mounds. Of the later graves, some women&#x27;s graves appear to be distinguished by placement of rocks in a circle or oval, but most of the graves are marked with rocks either in a triangle or in the traditional shape of a boat (stone ship), indicating the importance that the Vikings placed upon water. The ship settings constitute the largest assemblage of well-preserved examples extant. The shape and size of the grave outline apparently indicate the status of the person – all of which is reminiscent of the ship burials of the Anglo-Saxons, Norwegian and Swedish Vikings and other ancient Germanic societies.

A museum adjacent to the site donated by Aalborg Portland A/S cement company to commemorate their centennial was opened in 1992. In 2008 the museum was enlarged, and a new exhibition of pre-history in the area of the Limfjord opened.

<doc id="530844" wikidata="Q67693584" url="?curid=530844" title="Lithuanian orthography">
<text>Lithuanian orthography employs a Latin-script alphabet of 32 letters, two of which denote sounds not native to the Lithuanian language. Additionally, it uses five digraphs.

==Alphabet==
Today, the Lithuanian alphabet consists of 32 letters. It features an unusual collation order in that &quot;Y&quot; occurs between I nosinė (Į) and J. While absent from the alphabet, letters Q, W and X have their place in collation order: Q is located between P and R, and W with X are preceded by letter V. Those letters may be used in spelling of foreign names.

The distinctive Lithuanian letter &quot;Ė&quot; was used for the first time in Daniel Klein&#x27;s &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot;, and has been firmly established in the Lithuanian language since then. However, linguist August Schleicher used &quot;Ë&quot; (with two points above it) instead of &quot;Ė&quot; for expressing the same. In the &quot;Grammatica Litvanica&quot; Klein also established the letter &quot;W&quot; for marking the sound &quot;V&quot;, the use of which was later abolished in the Lithuanian language (it was replaced with letter &quot;V&quot;, notably by authors of the &quot;Varpas&quot; newspaper). The usage of letter &quot;V&quot; instead of &quot;W&quot; especially increased since the early 20th century, likely considerably influenced by Lithuanian press and schools.

Due to the Polish influence, the Lithuanian alphabet included &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; and the Polish &quot;Ł&quot; for the sound [] and regular L (without a following i) for the sound []: &quot;łupa&quot;, &quot;lutas&quot;. During the Lithuanian National Revival in the 19th century the Polish &quot;Ł&quot; was abolished, while digraphs &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; (that are also common in the Polish orthography) were replaced with letters &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; from the Czech orthography because they formally were shorter. Nevertheless, another argument to abolish digraphs &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; was to distinguish the Lithuanian language from the Polish language. The new letters &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; were cautiously used in publications intended for more educated readers (e.g. &quot;Varpas&quot;, &quot;Tėvynės sargas&quot;, &quot;Ūkininkas&quot;), however digraphs &quot;sz&quot;, &quot;cz&quot; continued to be in use in publications intended for less educated readers as &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; caused tension in society; &quot;š&quot; and &quot;č&quot; have prevailed only since 1906.

The Lithuanians also adopted letter &quot;ž&quot; from the Czechs.

The letters &quot;ą&quot; and &quot;ę&quot; were taken from the Polish spelling for what at the time were nasal vowels. They were first used by Renaissance Lithuanian writers. Later the letters &quot;į&quot; and &quot;ų&quot; were introduced for the remaining nasal vowels, which have since denasalized. Letter &quot;ū&quot; is the latest addition by linguist Jonas Jablonskis.

Acute, grave, and macron/tilde accents can mark stress and vowel length. However, these are generally not used, except in dictionaries and where needed for clarity. In addition, Lithuanian orthography uses five digraphs (Ch Dz Dž Ie Uo); these function as sequences of two letters for collation purposes. The &quot;Ch&quot; digraph represents a voiceless velar fricative, while the others are straightforward compositions of their component letters. The letters F and H, as well as the digraph CH, denote sounds only appearing in loanwords.

==Spelling of foreign names==
Two spelling variants are used for foreign personal names: original spelling (e. g. &quot;George Walker Bush&quot; as a title of an encyclopedic article or as a name of an author of a book, or &quot;George&#x27;as Walkeris Bushas&quot; in a sentence, conforming to the Lithuanian morphology) and phonetic spelling adapted to the Lithuanian phonology (e. g. &quot;Džordžas Volkeris Bušas&quot;). In Soviet times, phonetic spelling was the only standard way to write foreign names in Lithuanian (original spelling could be shown in parentheses if needed), but in post-Soviet times the original spelling came to be widely used. The Lithuanian Wikipedia uses original spelling in article titles, but phonetic spelling in article texts.

==Q, W, and X==
The Lithuanian alphabet lacks Q (&quot;kū&quot;), W (&quot;vė dviguboji&quot;) and X (&quot;iks&quot;) of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. They are only used in foreign words and personal names of origin, as well as expressions and in international symbols.

==Sound–spelling correspondences==
 is short only in loanwords. are always short without accent and under accent in endings &quot;-a&quot;, &quot;-e&quot;, &quot;-es&quot;, in comparative, in pronouns, and in loanwords; otherwise, they are usually long.
Consonants are always palatalized before ; before , palatalization is denoted by inserting an between the consonant and the vowel.

==Unicode==
The majority of the Lithuanian alphabet is in the Unicode block C0 controls and basic Latin (non-accented symbols), and the rest of the Lithuanian alphabet (Ą ą Č č Ę ę Ė ė Į į Š š Ų ų Ū ū Ž ž) is in the Latin Extended-A.

<text>Sambor I, &quot;princeps Pomoranorum&quot; () (c. 1150 – c. 1207) was regent of Pomerelia from 1180 until his death.

He was the elder son of Duke Sobiesław I and an early scion of the Samborides dynasty, which is named after him. According to the &quot;Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae&quot; by Wincenty Kadłubek, Sambor I between 1177 and 1180 was recognized as Duke of Pomerelia and successor of his father by the Polish High Duke Casimir II the Just. He resided at Gdańsk, where he promoted the immigration of German settlers in the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; and founded the St. Nicholas&#x27; Church in about 1190. He is also mentioned in an 1186 deed as the founder of the Cistercian abbey at Oliwa, a filial monastery of Kołbacz.

Sambor was married and had two sons who died at a young age. The 14th-century obituary of Oliwa Abbey denotes the date of his death as 7 February 1207, however, Sambor probably died under the reign of High Duke Władysław III Spindleshanks (1202–1206). He was succeeded by his younger brother Mestwin I.

<doc id="530850" wikidata="Q6744093" url="?curid=530850" title="Mallard Song">
<text>The Mallard Song is an ancient tradition of All Souls&#x27; College, Oxford. It is sung every year at the Bursar&#x27;s Dinner in March and the college&#x27;s Gaudy in November and also sung in a separate special ceremony once a century.

== The ceremony ==
In the ceremony, Fellows parade around the college with flaming torches, led by a &quot;Lord Mallard&quot; who is carried in a chair, in search of a giant mallard that supposedly flew out of the foundations of the college when it was being built in 1437. The procession is led by an individual carrying a duck — originally dead, now just wooden — tied to the end of a vertical pole. The ceremony was last held in 2001, with Martin Litchfield West acting as Lord Mallard. His predecessor as Lord Mallard was Cosmo Lang, who presided over the centenary ceremony in 1901.

== The song ==

The words of the song are as follows:

:The Griffine, Bustard, Turkey &amp; Capon
:Lett other hungry Mortalls gape on
:And on theire bones with Stomacks fall hard,
:But lett All Souls&#x27; Men have ye Mallard.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;:
:&quot;Hough the bloud of King Edward,&quot;
:&quot;By ye bloud of King Edward,&quot;
:&quot;It was a swapping, swapping mallard!&quot;

:Some storys strange are told I trow
:By Baker, Holinshead &amp; Stow
:Of Cocks &amp; Bulls, &amp; other queire things
:That happen&#x27;d in ye Reignes of theire Kings.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;

:The Romans once admir&#x27;d a gander
:More than they did theire best Commander,
:Because hee saved, if some don&#x27;t foolle us,
:The place named from ye Scull of Tolus.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;

:The Poets fain&#x27;d Jove turn&#x27;d a Swan,
:But lett them prove it if they can.
:To mak&#x27;t appeare it&#x27;s not att all hard:
:Hee was a swapping, swapping mallard.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;

:Hee was swapping all from bill to eye,
:Hee was swapping all from wing to thigh;
:His swapping tool of generation
:Oute swapped all ye wingged Nation.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;

:Then lett us drink and dance a Galliard
:in ye Remembrance of ye Mallard,
:And as ye Mallard doth in Poole,
:Let&#x27;s dabble, dive &amp; duck in Boule.

:&quot;CHORUS&quot;

==Folk song==
A folksong (Roud 1517) found in southern England is an accumulative song about the body of the mallard.

<doc id="530859" wikidata="Q7714746" url="?curid=530859" title="The Astonishing Hypothesis">
<text>The Astonishing Hypothesis is a 1994 book by scientist Francis Crick about consciousness. Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the molecular structure of DNA, later became a theorist for neurobiology and the study of the brain. &quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis&quot; is mostly concerned with establishing a basis for scientific study of consciousness; however, Crick places the study of consciousness within a larger social context. Human consciousness according to Crick is central to human existence and so scientists find themselves approaching topics traditionally left to philosophy and religion.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis&quot; posits that &quot;a person&#x27;s mental activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make them up and influence them.&quot; Crick claims that scientific study of the brain during the 20th century led to acceptance of consciousness, free will, and the human soul as subjects for scientific investigation.

Rather than attempting to cover all the aspects of consciousness (self-awareness, thought, imagination, perception, etc.), Crick focuses on the primate visual system and breaks down the prerequisites for conscious experience into several broad subconditions, including some sort of short-term memory and attention mechanism. The book then delves into a brief overview of many neuroscientific topics, ranging from a survey of how neurons function to a description of basic neural circuits and their artificial equivalents. Throughout, Crick cites various experiments which illustrate the points he is making about visual awareness, such as studies investigating the phenomenon of blindsight in macaques.

The later chapters of the book synthesize many of the points made earlier about the visual system into a unified framework, although Crick recognises exceptions to his proposed framework. Also, here he takes the opportunity to make suggestions for further experiments that could provide empirical basis for further understanding about human consciousness and includes a brief addendum on several topics he glossed over, like free will. Overall, the message Crick repeats as the main purpose of writing the &quot;Astonishing Hypothesis&quot; is to break the scientific community&#x27;s reluctance to give consciousness a thorough and scientifically-grounded investigation, and to encourage others such as philosophers to address the issues of consciousness in a way that takes account of neuroscientific discoveries.

==Background and response==
Crick had discussed the relationship between science and religion in his earlier book &quot;What Mad Pursuit&quot;. Crick&#x27;s view of this relationship was that religions can be wrong about scientific matters and that part of what science does is to confront the errors that exist within religious traditions. For example, the idea of a mechanism for the evolution of life by natural selection conflicts with some views on creation of life by divine intervention. Crick&#x27;s subtitle for &quot;The Astonishing Hypothesis&quot; is &quot;The Scientific Search for the Soul&quot;.

==Criticism==
Some have criticized the book&#x27;s main conceit from different angles. Neurologist and Nobel Laureate Gerald Edelman believes that neural Darwinism is a more satisfactory explanation for the emergence of complex intelligence in humans. Another school of thought, this one largely made up of those outside of scientific disciplines, consider consciousness to either be simply beyond the possibility of explanation or at least dependent on some qualities that are not simply physical (i.e. molecules, etc.). There are also a few fringe theorists who support a quantum theory of mind also disagree that the brain&#x27;s function reduces to only classical physics.

Chen was born in Tokyo in 1956. His father was Chen Kenmin, a Chinese-born chef and restaurateur, who is regarded as the father of Sichuan cuisine (四川料理) in Japan. Chen&#x27;s signature dish, &quot;prawns in chili Sauce&quot; (Ebi Chili) (干烧明虾), was an adaptation of a dish that his father had introduced to Japan. As a result, Chen was often compared to his father on the series, with some saying that &quot;Iron Chef&quot; helped the son exceed the skills of his father.

Chen attended the Tokyo Chinese School and Tamagawa Gakuen High School, and graduated from Tamagawa University with a degree in English and American Literature.

== &quot;Iron Chef&quot; ==
Chen originally accepted his position on &quot;Iron Chef&quot; out of the need for a challenge, although the format of the show intrigued him. Even though he was the longest-serving Iron Chef and the only original Iron Chef, having been an Iron Chef for the series&#x27; six-year run, Chen had on several occasions considered leaving his position; among his reasons was the desire to tend to his restaurants, which had become booked every night since the show&#x27;s start, as well as a bout of depression following the death of his mother. Ultimately, it was fellow Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai who convinced Chen to stay, with their agreement that should one leave the show, so would the other.

Because of his long tenure, Chen fought more battles than any of the other Iron Chefs, at 92
battles. He won 67, lost 22, and tied 3. He also enjoyed a run of 14 consecutive victories, the longest of any Iron Chef. His most memorable dish was chili prawns.

Despite his excellent record on the show, Chen often appeared endearingly surprised and relieved at victory. Arguably, his win over Japanese-Italian-French &quot;fusion&quot;-style chef Juinichi Itoh in the yogurt battle exemplifies this. He was also remarkable for his frequent tasting of food, frequently dipping his ladle into steaming concoctions for sampling, only to place the same ladle back in the food. The commentators to the show referred to this practice in humor as Chen&#x27;s &quot;eating&quot;.

=== Memorable matches ===
Among Chen&#x27;s more memorable matches was one with challenger Dominique Corby of the Tour d&#x27;Argent, where, after the main battle (with foie gras as the theme ingredient) was fought to a tie, the overtime battle (with asparagus as the theme) also resulted in a tie—the only time that such an outcome occurred in the series. Rather than have Chen and Corby fight a second overtime battle, Chairman Kaga, the show&#x27;s host decreed that both contestants were the winners, effectively calling the battle a draw.

As with other Iron Chefs, Chen &quot;feuded&quot; with a warring faction that acknowledged the worthiness of his culinary caliber who were determined to take him down. In his case, he battled with the chefs of Heichinrou restaurant in Yokohama, defeating two of their members before finally losing to their head chef in an overtime battle.

*Takashi Saito (not to be confused with the baseball player), top apprentice of Chen Kenmin and coach of Chen Kenichi. Chen beat his tutor in a prawn battle. Saito re-created Kenmin&#x27;s original prawns in chili sauce, while Kenichi created his father&#x27;s modern version of the dish (canapé style with ketchup).
*Junichi Itoh had one of the most interesting cooking styles in the world. He began practicing French cooking at age 18 and left for France at the age of 28 to further his culinary skills. However, Itoh left for Italy three years later and joined Enoteca Pincchiori, the same place where Iron Chef Italian Masahiko Kobe was trained. At age 32, Itoh began training at a top Japanese restaurant to learn Japanese culinary traditions further extending his arsenal of culinary expertise. By the time that Itoh was 35, he opened his restaurant L&#x27;Herlequin Bis in Tokyo. His French-Italian-Japanese fusion cooking style caught the attention of Takeshi Kaga which led him to invite Itoh to be asked to appear on the Iron Chef television show as a challenger. Itoh accepted the offer and went to Kitchen Stadium with Japanese culinary critic and journalist Asako Kishi, who was known for her role as a guest judge on the show as frequent member on the Iron Chef tasting panel. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, he chose Chen Kenichi as the opponent, saying that he was interested in Chinese cuisine, but had never been trained at it. Kaga chose a difficult theme ingredient, plain yoghurt. Itoh was smiling while Chen was under great pressure. However, according to Kishi&#x27;s comments at the end, all of Itoh&#x27;s dishes used the yoghurt as a supporting ingredient instead of the main focus of the dish. This resulted in all four judges voting for Chen. This was quite a surprise to Chen, who pointed to himself in disbelief.
*Katsuyo Kobayashi was the show&#x27;s second female challenger and a popular TV chef in her own right, hosting &quot;Kyo no ryori&quot; (&quot;Today&#x27;s cooking&quot;) on NHK. She allowed Chairman Kaga to choose the Iron Chef for her and he gleefully chose Chen, who had previously lost to Kitchen Stadium&#x27;s first female challenger, Kyoko Kagata. At one point during the battle, in which potatoes were the theme ingredient, Kobayashi paid a brief visit to Chen&#x27;s station to observe his cooking, which he wasn&#x27;t very pleased about. Chen ultimately lost to Kobayashi, with the judges commenting that his potatoes tended to be undercooked or underplayed.

== Outside &quot;Iron Chef&quot;==
Chen was an avid baseball fan and stated that it would have been his choice to go professional but opted not to.

Outside of &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, Chen was also an active restauranteur. He operated the &quot;Shisen Hanten&quot; (四川飯店, lit. &quot;Sichuan restaurant&quot;) group of restaurants located in Akasaka, Ikebukuro and Roppongi in Tokyo, as well as Tokushima city in Tokushima Prefecture; Kure, Hiroshima; Matsuyama, Ehime; and Hakata-ku, Fukuoka. The restaurant was inherited from his father and he was the third to run it after his mother took over.

Shisen Hanten&#x27;s branch in Singapore, ran by his son , has earned two Michelin stars since 2016. It is located in the newly renovated 1000+ room Hilton Singapore hotel, the largest hotel in the Asia Pacific.

== Death ==
According to Minken Kigyo, the company Chen established and was the former CEO, Chen died of interstitial lung disease on 11 March 2023, at age 67.

<doc id="530862" wikidata="Q422745" url="?curid=530862" title="Benzocaine">
<text>Benzocaine, sold under the brand name Orajel amongst others, is a local anesthetic, belonging to the amino ester drug class, commonly used as a topical painkiller or in cough drops. It is the active ingredient in many over-the-counter anesthetic ointments such as products for oral ulcers. It is combined with antipyrine to form A/B ear drops. In the US, products containing benzocaine for oral application are contraindicated in children younger than two years old. In the European Union, the contraindication applies to children under 12 years of age.
It was first synthesised in 1890 in Germany and approved for medical use in 1902.

==Medical uses==
Benzocaine is indicated to treat a variety of pain-related conditions. It may be used for:

* Local anesthesia of oral and pharyngeal mucous membranes (sore throat, cold sores, mouth ulcers, toothache, sore gums, denture irritation)
* Otic pain (earache)
* Surgical or procedural local anesthesia
* Relief of skin pain caused by sunburn, ingrown toenails, hemorrhoids, 

Examples of combination medications of benzocaine include:

*Antipyrine-benzocaine otic consists of antipyrine and benzocaine, and is used to relieve ear pain and remove earwax.
*Cepacol consists of menthol and benzocaine, and is used to treat sore throat.
* A solution of benzocaine and menthol is marketed for the treatment of bee stings, mosquito bites, jellyfish stings, and other insect bites

===Other uses===
Benzocaine is used as a key ingredient in numerous pharmaceuticals:

* Some glycerol-based ear medications for use in removing excess wax as well as relieving ear conditions such as &quot;otitis media&quot; and swimmer&#x27;s ear.
* Some previous diet products such as Ayds.
* Some condoms designed to prevent premature ejaculation. Benzocaine largely inhibits sensitivity on the penis, and can allow for an erection to be maintained longer (in a continuous act) by delaying ejaculation. Conversely, an erection will also fade faster if stimulus is interrupted.
* Benzocaine mucoadhesive patches have been used in reducing orthodontic pain.
* In Poland it is included, together with menthol and zinc oxide, in the liquid powder (not to be confused with the liquid face powder) used mainly after mosquito bites. Today&#x27;s ready-made Pudroderm was once used there as pharmaceutical compound.

===Available forms===
Benzocaine can come in a variety of preparations including:

Oral preparations:

* Lozenges (ex. Cepacol, Mycinettes)
* Throat Spray (ex. Ultra Chloraseptic)

Topical preparations:
* Aerosol (ex. Topex)
* Gel (ex. Orajel, Kank-A) 
* Paste (ex. Orabase)
* Cream (ex. Lanacane - active ingredient 3% Benzocaine)
Otic preparations:
* Solution (ex. Allergen)

==Side effects==
Benzocaine is generally well tolerated and non-toxic when applied topically as recommended.

However, there have been reports of serious, life-threatening adverse effects (e.g., seizures, coma, irregular heart beat, respiratory depression) with over-application of topical products or when applying topical products that contain high concentrations of benzocaine to the skin.

Overapplication of oral anesthetics such as benzocaine can increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration by relaxing the gag-reflex and allowing regurgitated stomach contents or oral secretions to enter the airway. Applying an oral anesthetic and consuming beverages before going to bed can be particularly hazardous.

The topical use of higher concentration (10–20%) benzocaine products applied to the mouth or mucous membranes has been found to be a cause of methemoglobinemia, a disorder in which the amount of oxygen carried by the blood is greatly reduced. This side effect is most common in children under two years of age. As a result, the FDA has stated that benzocaine products should not be used in children under two years of age, unless directed by and supervised by a healthcare professional. In European countries, the contraindication applies to children under 12 years of age. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia usually occur within minutes to hours of applying benzocaine, and can occur upon the first-time use or after additional use.

Benzocaine may cause allergic reactions. These include:
* Contact dermatitis (redness and itchiness)
* Anaphylaxis (rare)

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Pain is caused by the stimulation of free nerve endings. When the nerve endings are stimulated, sodium enters the neuron, causing depolarization of the nerve and subsequent initiation of an action potential. The action potential is propagated down the nerve toward the central nervous system, which interprets this as pain. Benzocaine acts to inhibit the voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) on the neuron membrane, stopping the propagation of the action potential.

==Chemistry==
Benzocaine is the ethyl ester of &quot;p&quot;-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). It can be prepared from PABA and ethanol by Fischer esterification or via the reduction of ethyl &quot;p&quot;-nitrobenzoate. Benzocaine is sparingly soluble in water; it is more soluble in dilute acids and very soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and ethyl ether. The melting point of benzocaine is 88–92 °C, and the boiling point is about 310 °C. The density of benzocaine is 1.17 g/cm3.

Benzocaine is commonly found, particularly in Britain, as an additive in street cocaine and also as a bulking agent in &quot;legal highs&quot;. Benzocaine gives a numbing effect similar to cocaine and as a bulking and binding agent it can not be detected once mixed. It is the most popular cutting agent worldwide. 
Treatment of benzocaine with hydrazine leads to aminostimil, a compound related to isoniazid.

===Synthesis===
Benzocaine can be prepared by esterification using 4-aminobenzoic acid and ethanol. It can also be prepared by reduction of ethyl 4-nitrobenzoate to the amine. In industrial practice, the reducing agent is usually iron and water in the presence of a little acid.

==History==
Benzocaine was first synthesized in 1890 by the German chemist Eduard Ritsert (1859–1946), in the town of Eberbach and introduced to the market in 1902 under the name &quot;Anästhesin&quot;.

==Veterinary medicine==
Bath solutions of benzocaine and its derivatives are commonly used to anesthetize amphibians for surgery. Benzocaine-based anesthetics are potent and highly effective for both anesthesia and euthanasia in amphibians.

<text>Trifolium repens, the white clover, is a herbaceous perennial plant in the bean family Fabaceae (otherwise known as Leguminosae). It is native to Europe, including the British Isles, and central Asia and is one of the most widely cultivated types of clover. It has been widely introduced worldwide as a forage crop, and is now also common in most grassy areas (lawns and gardens) of North America, Australia and New Zealand. The species includes varieties often classed as small, intermediate and large, according to height, which reflects petiole length. The term &#x27;white clover&#x27; is applied to the species in general, &#x27;Dutch clover&#x27; is often applied to intermediate varieties (but sometimes to smaller varieties), and &#x27;ladino clover&#x27; is applied to large varieties.

== Name ==

The genus name, &quot;Trifolium&quot;, derives from the Latin &#x27;, &quot;three&quot;, and &#x27;, &quot;leaf&quot;, so called from the characteristic form of the leaf, which almost always has three leaflets (trifoliolate); hence the popular name &quot;trefoil&quot;. The species name, &quot;&quot;, is Latin for &quot;creeping&quot;.

== Description ==
It is a herbaceous, perennial plant. It is low growing, with flowering heads of whitish florets, often with a tinge of pink or cream that may come on with the aging of the plant. The heads are generally wide, and are at the end of peduncles or inflorescence stalks. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees and often by honey bees. The leaves are trifoliolate, smooth, elliptic to egg-shaped and long-petioled and usually with light or dark markings. The stems function as stolons, so white clover often forms mats, with the stems creeping as much as a year, and rooting at the nodes. The leaves form the symbol known as shamrock. Almost always, a white clover will be trifoliolate. However, one can, but only sometimes, possess four or more leaflets.

==Varieties and subspecies==
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; subsp. &quot;macrorrhizum&quot; 
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; var. &quot;nevadense&quot; 
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; var. &quot;ochranthum&quot; 
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; var. &quot;orbelicum&quot; 
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; var. &quot;orphanideum&quot; 
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; var. &quot;pipolina&quot;
*&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; subsp. &quot;prostratum&quot; 

==Distribution==
It is native in Europe and Central Asia, ubiquitous throughout the British Isles, introduced in North America, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and elsewhere, and globally cultivated as a forage crop.

White clover has been used as a model organism for global research into ecology and urban evolution. As part of the Global Urban Evolution Project (GLUE) scientists from 26 countries examined the production of cyanide by over 110,000 clover plants from 160 cities. Cyanide can be useful to clover plants as a deterrent to herbivores.
Analyzing urban-rural differences, scientists found that cyanide production tended to increase with distance from the center of cities, suggesting that clover populations were adapting to factors commonly found in urban centers worldwide. Possible factors could include temperature (freezing is related to cyanide content), herbivory pressures, and drought stress. As clover habitats, the downtowns of cities may more closely resemble other far-flung cities than nearby rural areas.

== Ancestry ==
&quot;Trifolium repens&quot; is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 32) of two diploid ancestors and exhibits disomic inheritance. In order to increase genetic diversity for breeding, research is focused on finding these ancestors. Proposed ancestors of &quot;T. repens&quot; include &quot;T. nigrescens&quot;, &quot;T. occidentale&quot;, &quot;T. pallescens&quot;, and &quot;T. uniflorum&quot;. Additionally, it is possible that one of the diploid ancestors has yet to be analyzed, either because it has not been discovered or is extinct.

== Cultivation and uses ==

===Forage===
White clover has been described as the most important forage legume of the temperate zones. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (up to of N, although usually much less, e.g. about ) in root nodules of white clover obviates synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use for maintaining productivity on much temperate zone pasture land. White clover is commonly grown in mixtures with forage grasses, e.g. perennial ryegrass (&quot;Lolium perenne&quot;). Such mixtures can not only optimize livestock production, but can also reduce the bloat risk to livestock that can be associated with excessive white clover in pastures. Such species mixtures also tend to avoid issues that could otherwise be associated with cyanogenic glycosides (linamarin and lotaustralin) intake on pure or nearly pure stands of some white clover varieties. However, problems do not inevitably arise with grazing on monocultures of white clover, and superior ruminant production is sometimes achieved on white clover monocultures managed to optimize sward height.

The &quot;O&quot;-methylated isoflavones formononetin and biochanin A play a role in arbuscular mycorrhiza formation on white clover roots, and foliar disease can stimulate production of estrogenic coumestans in white clover. However, while there have been a few reports of phytoestrogenic effects of white clover on grazing ruminants, these have been far less common than such reports regarding some varieties of subterranean clover (&quot;Trifolium subterraneum&quot;) and red clover (&quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;). Among forage plants, some white clover varieties tend to be favored by rather close grazing, because of their stoloniferous habit, which can contribute to competitive advantage.

=== Companion planting, green manure, and cover crops === 
White clover grows well as a companion plant among lawns, grain crops, pasture grasses, and vegetable rows. It is often added to lawn seed mixes, as it is able to grow and provide green cover in poorer soils where turfgrasses do not perform well. White clover can tolerate close mowing and grazing, and it can grow on many different types and pHs of soil (although it prefers clay soils). As a leguminous and hardy plant, it is considered to be a beneficial component of natural or organic pasture management and lawn care due to its ability to fix nitrogen and out-compete weeds. Natural nitrogen fixing reduces leaching from the soil and by maintaining soil health can reduce the incidence of some lawn diseases that are enhanced by the availability of synthetic fertilizer. For these reasons, it is often used as a green manure and cover crop.

=== Culinary uses ===
Besides making an excellent forage crop for livestock, its leaves and flowers are a valuable survival food: they are high in proteins, and are widespread and abundant. The fresh plants have been used for centuries as additives to salads and other meals consisting of leafy vegetables. They are not easy for humans to digest raw, but, this is however easily fixed by boiling the harvested plants for 5–10 minutes. Native Americans ate some species raw. Dried white clover flowers may also be smoked as a herbal alternative to tobacco.

=== Medicinal uses ===
In India, &quot;T. repens&quot; is considered a folk medicine against intestinal helminthic worms, and an experimental in-vivo study validated that the aerial shoots of &quot;T. repens&quot; bear significant anticestodal (anti-tapeworm) properties.

==Etymology==
&quot;Trifolium&quot; means &#x27;trefoil&#x27; (three-lobed leaves); this is Pliny’s name for trifoliate plants.

&quot;Repens&quot; means &#x27;creeping&#x27; or &#x27;stoloniferous&#x27;.

<text>Youngstown State University (YSU or Youngstown State) is a public university in Youngstown, Ohio, United States. It was founded in 1908 and is the easternmost member of the University System of Ohio.

The university is composed of six undergraduate colleges and a graduate college. Youngstown State University has over 100 undergraduate degree programs and 50 graduate degree programs serving over 11,000 students in studies up to the doctoral level. Beyond its current student body, the university has more than 115,000 alumni across the country and around the world.

Collectively known as the Penguins, Youngstown State&#x27;s athletic teams compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The university is a member of the Horizon League in all varsity sports, with the exception of football which competes in the Football Championship Subdivision of the NCAA as a member of the Missouri Valley Football Conference, bowling which competes in Conference USA, and lacrosse which competes in the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

==History==
The university&#x27;s origins trace back to 1908, when the local branch of the YMCA established a school of law within the Youngstown Association School. In 1921, the school became known as the Youngstown Institute of Technology and offered its first evening courses. In 1928, a year after establishing a College of Arts and Sciences, the institute once again changed its name to Youngstown College. In 1955, the name was changed again to Youngstown University to reflect the school&#x27;s broadening curriculum. On September 1, 1967, after becoming a public institution, it was renamed once more to Youngstown State University. The following spring, YSU opened a Graduate School and College of Applied Science and Technology. In 1974, the College of Fine and Performing Arts was established.

In August 2005, just before the start of the 2005–06 academic year, two of four campus unions were on strike. Following the conclusion of the strike, relations remained strained, with some faculty and staff calling for the resignation of YSU president David Sweet in May 2007.

Following the February 29, 2024, announcement that Eastern Gateway Community College was pausing enrollment, YSU announced that it was considering opening its first satellite campus in Steubenville, Ohio to serve displaced students in the Ohio Valley.

==Campus==

YSU lies on a campus just north of downtown Youngstown. 

Kilcawley Center is the university&#x27;s student center, located at the center of campus. It features reading rooms, computer labs, a copying center, a variety of restaurants and student affairs offices. Offices for many university student media outlets are housed here, including student newspaper &quot;The Jambar&quot;, student magazine &quot;The Yo&quot;, and student radio &quot;Rookery Radio&quot;. There are also many meeting and seminar rooms, which can be rented out for community events.

Jones Hall, often the building that welcomes those coming onto YSU&#x27;s campus, was built in 1931 and is one of the campus&#x27;s oldest buildings, having been built in 1931. The building was renamed Jones Hall in honor of the institution&#x27;s first president, Dr. Howard Jones. Today, the building is used as administrative office space.

Fok Hall houses the Sokolov Honors College, which consists of administrative offices and classrooms. It was built in 1893 and is the oldest building on campus. Previously the Alumni Building, Fok Hall was renamed in 2014 after a $2.5 million donation to the university by Maria Fok, whose late husband was a professor and trustee of YSU.

In 2013, the former Wick Pollock Inn was converted into the university president&#x27;s house. The three-year project to renovate the mansion cost YSU over $4 million.

The first facility of its kind at any university in Ohio, the 6,000 sq. ft., fully handicap-accessible Veterans Resource Center houses the Office of Veteran Affairs, as well as lounges, computer labs, and community spaces reserved for student veterans, currently serving members of the military, and military-dependent students.

Home to the YSU Foundation, Melnick Hall is also home to the university&#x27;s public radio station, WYSU-FM 88.5, which is affiliated with NPR and American Public Media.

Bliss Hall is the home of the Cliffe College of Creative Arts, including the Departments of Art, Theater &amp; Dance, and the Dana School of Music. This building also houses the Department of Communication with programs in communication studies, journalism, and multimedia communications. The building, completed in 1977, features the 390-seat Ford Theatre, the 248-seat Bliss Recital Hall, an experimental theatre, 80 practice rooms with Steinway pianos, TV studio, and audio production labs, as well as the Judith Rae Solomon Gallery, and fully equipped ceramics, photography, metals, and other artistic studios.

Ward Beecher Hall houses the departments of biology, chemistry, physics and astronomy. The five-story original unit was constructed in 1958, a major addition was built in 1967 and a small addition comprising chemical storerooms was completed in 1997. The building contains 31 laboratories, including a planetarium and greenhouse, nine classrooms, 53 faculty-research rooms, and a seminar room. Ward Beecher houses the university&#x27;s planetarium, which opened in 1967 and includes a planetarium projector.

Tod Hall houses the administrative offices of many university officials, including the president, provost, and the Board of Trustees, as well as the Offices of Assessment, Marketing Communications, Human Resources, and others. Other academic buildings on campus include Beeghly Hall, Coffelt Hall, Cushwa Hall, DeBartolo Hall, Fedor Hall, Cafaro Hall, Meshel Hall, Moser Hall, Silvestri Hall, Sweeney Hall, and Williamson Hall.

===Museums===
The McDonough Museum of Art is one of two art museums located in Youngstown, Ohio. The McDonough Museum of Art is closely affiliated with the university, acting as an outreach for the Department of Art. The 14,000 sq. ft. space serves as a showing facility for art students and faculty alike, as well as local and regional talents.

The Butler Institute of American Art is located on Wick Avenue in Youngstown, Ohio. Falling directly on YSU&#x27;s campus, it is the flagship art museum of the city.

==Academics==

The university comprises seven undergraduate and graduate colleges:
* Beeghly College of Liberal Arts, Social Science &amp; Education
* Bitonte College of Health and Human Services
* Cliffe College of Creative Arts
* College of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
* Williamson College of Business Administration
* College of Graduate Studies
* Sokolov Honors College

YSU offers approximately 100 undergraduate majors, 40 master&#x27;s programs, and five doctoral degrees. It has partnerships with various other postsecondary institutions, including a juris doctor track with the University of Akron, a doctor of medicine track with the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine or Northeast Ohio Medical University, and master&#x27;s programs with the University of Akron and Cleveland State University.

The Dana School of Music at Youngstown State University was deemed an &quot;All-Steinway&quot; school in 2004. The Dana School of Music is one of the oldest non-conservatory schools of music in the United States. The Williamson College of Business is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).

In addition to traditional four-year programs, Youngstown State University also offers online degree programs and three-year degree pathways. Since 2004, YSU has participated in the Youngstown Early College program, through which students from the Youngstown City School District can take courses for college credit and earn an associate&#x27;s degree while in high school.

===Centers and institutes===
YSU operates several Centers of Excellence and designated research and economic development programs, including the Center for Transportation and Materials Engineering, the Center of Excellence in Materials Science and Engineering, the Center of Excellence in International Business, the Center for Applied Chemical Biology, the Institute for Applied Topology, and effective in 2012, the Natural Gas and Water Resources Institute.

Youngstown State University is also home to the Center for Working Class Studies and offers a Regional and American Studies program, which was the first of its kind in the United States. The school assisted the University of Chicago in developing a similar program.

The university&#x27;s Center for Judaic and Holocaust Studies was put into jeopardy when Jacob Ari Labendz, the only professor at YSU qualified to teach Holocaust studies, was laid off in 2021.

===Library===
The Maag Library opened in 1976 and was named after one of the local public library and Youngstown State University&#x27;s trustees, William F. Maag, Jr. Before it opened, Maag Library became a member of the Federal Depository Library Program in 1971. Currently, it is a six-story building with over 500,000 volumes in-house, as well as access to the collections of 84 other Ohio institutions via participation in the OhioLINK program. The building also houses the writing center and the university&#x27;s English Language Institute.

Located on the fifth floor of Maag Library, the Archives and Special Collections at Youngstown State is meant to preserve items with historical significance to the school, Youngstown and Mahoning County, as well as its history in the iron and steel industry.

==Student life==
As of fall 2019, the student body totaled approximately 12,155, 10% of whom were dual-enrolled high school students. YSU has approximately 2,100 full and part-time employees and 426 full-time faculty with 543 part-time faculty. 165 faculty members have full-professor rank, with 79% of the instructors holding doctorates or terminal degrees. The university has a student-to-faculty ratio of 14:1.

YSU owns and operates five on-campus residence halls: Cafaro House, Kilcawley House, Lyden House, Weller House, and Wick House. Numerous privately-owned student apartment complexes are located close to YSU&#x27;s campus.

==Athletics==

The Youngstown State Penguins is the name given to the athletic teams of YSU. The university is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s (NCAA) Division I, and the Penguins compete in football as members of the Missouri Valley Football Conference. Most other sports compete as members of the Horizon League. Sports teams include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, swimming, diving, tennis, track and field, volleyball, softball, soccer, lacrosse, and bowling.

The Youngstown State Penguins football team plays as a member of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision. The Penguins have played their home games in Stambaugh Stadium since 1982. YSU football has been one of the leading programs in NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision, winning four national championships under former head coach Jim Tressel, which is third behind North Dakota State&#x27;s seven titles and Georgia Southern&#x27;s six. Overall, YSU has made 13 playoff appearances since Division I FCS was formed in 1978.

The Youngstown State Penguins women&#x27;s basketball and Youngstown State Penguins men&#x27;s basketball teams compete at Beeghly Center, a 6,300-seat, multi-purpose arena built in 1972. The women&#x27;s team has appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament three times. The men&#x27;s team has appeared in the NCAA Division II Tournament nine times and the NAIA tournament four times.

<text>The Netherlands has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 64 times since making its debut as one of the seven countries at the first contest in . The country has missed only four contests, twice because the dates coincided with Remembrance of the Dead (1985 and 1991), and twice because of being relegated due to poor results the previous year (1995 and 2002). It has missed the final despite qualifying once, in 2024, due to the personal conduct of its entrant which led to disqualification. The current Dutch participant broadcaster in the contest is AVROTROS. The Netherlands has hosted the contest five times: in Hilversum (), Amsterdam (), The Hague ( and ), and Rotterdam ().

The Netherlands has won the contest five times, with &quot; performed by Corry Brokken (), &quot; by Teddy Scholten (), &quot;&quot; by Lenny Kuhr in a four-way tie (), &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; by Teach-In (), and &quot;Arcade&quot; by Duncan Laurence (). The country&#x27;s other top five results are &quot;&quot; by Sandra and Andres fourth (), &quot;I See a Star&quot; by Mouth and MacNeal third (), &quot;Amsterdam&quot; by Maggie MacNeal fifth (), &quot; by Marcha fifth (), &quot; by Edsilia Rombley fourth (), and &quot;Calm After the Storm&quot; by The Common Linnets second (). It finished last in , , , , and in the second semi-final in .

After the introduction of semi-finals in 2004, the Netherlands failed to reach the final for eight years in a row from 2005 to 2012, but has since participated in eight of the last 11 finals.

==History==

 (NTS) was a full member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), thus eligible to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. It participated in the contest representing the Netherlands since its in 1956. NTS was succeeded as participant broadcaster by (NOS) between 1970 and 2009, and (TROS) between 2010 and 2013. Since 2014, AVROTROS is the participant broadcaster representing the Netherlands.

===1956–1959: Quick success===

The Netherlands was one of seven countries competing in the inaugural 1956 contest. NTS presented the Nationaal Songfestival to select its entries to the contest. Corry Brokken and Jetty Paerl finished top two and qualified to Lugano. After a year, success came fast as &quot;Net als toen&quot; from Brokken won the in Frankfurt, receiving points from every single country. Sem Nijveen provided the violin solo. As a result, NTS hosted the in Hilversum. Brokken&#x27;s &quot;Heel de wereld&quot; received the first point from the first voting country, Switzerland, but it turned out to be the only point for her and finished tied ninth and last. Hosting and finishing last would not be repeated until Portugal in ; Austria in scored zero points alongside Germany but finished second last due to tie-breaking rules. In in Cannes, the Netherlands was represented by Teddy Scholten with &quot;Een beetje&quot;, a song about being unfaithful in a relationship. The led the voting, before sent seven points and France sent four more for another Dutch victory.

===1960–1968: Dark age===
Rudi Carrell and Annie Palmen won the national final with &quot;Wat een geluk&quot; in 1960 before Carrell was selected for but the song finished 12th (second last). Greetje Kauffeld failed to win three selections before being internally selected in with Wat een dag, which finished tied tenth. De Spelbrekers won with &quot;Katinka&quot;. This song is in the distinguished list for finishing last with 0 points but still being the more-remembered entries in the Netherlands from the Dark Age. In 1963, The members of the orchestra went on strike, which made the televised selection impossible. Palmen performed three songs for juries before &quot;Geen ander&quot;, later renamed &quot;Een speeldoos&quot; was selected. The song once again finished tied last with zero points. Dutch-Indonesian Anneke Grönloh with &quot;Jij bent mijn leven&quot; finished tied tenth in 1964. The had five semi-finals to select the song for each entrant. It was hosted by Teddy Scholten. Conny Vandenbos won with &quot;&#x27;t Is genoeg&quot;. Norway was the only country to give any points, the maximum 5 points, making the Netherlands finish 11th. Milly Scott was the first black performer to participate in , and the both gave &quot;Fernando en Filippo&quot; 1 point, having the Netherlands finish 15th. Harmelen hosted the 1967 selection. Winner Thérèse Steinmetz finished 14th with &quot;Ring-dinge-ding&quot;. In , the Netherlands finished last again with &quot;Morgen&quot; from Ronnie Tober.

===1969–1975: From Lenny Kuhr to Teach-In===
The brought Europe together by asking every single participating country in to vote with the Dutch juries. Conny Vink&#x27;s &quot;De toeteraar&quot; was beaten by Lenny Kuhr&#x27;s &quot;De troubadour&quot;. Dolf van der Linden refused to go to Madrid and the song was conducted by Frans de Kok. The last two countries brought the Netherlands, , the , and tied in first place with 18 points. Because there was no tie-breaking rule in place at the time, all 4 countries were announced as winners, which led to multiple countries withdrawing in 1970. The Netherlands beat France in coin-toss to host the in RAI Amsterdam. Hearts of Soul finished 7th with &quot;Waterman&quot;. Saskia and Serge finished second in 1970 national final before being internally selected for . The ballad &quot;Tijd&quot; finished tied sixth that night. It was the last song Dolf van der Linden conducted after 13 songs were conducted by him, of which two victories. Sandra and Andres&#x27;s &quot;Als het om de liefde gaat&quot; was the first entry where the audience clapped along. The Netherlands finished fourth, one point behind Germany. After &quot;De oude muzikant&quot; from Ben Cramer finished 14th in , the country sent Mouth and MacNeal with &quot;I See a Star&quot;. At , they had to face ABBA, former winner Gigliola Cinquetti and Olivia Newton-John before eventually finishing third. Teach In with &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot; won the , which was the first time since 1970 that the singers weren&#x27;t internally selected. The song received six twelve points, winning the contest for the fourth time, being the first song to win while opening the contest.

===1976–1985: Multiple hostings===

The Hague hosted the 1976 contest in Congresgebouw with former winner Corry Brokken presenting the show. Sandra Reemer returned with &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; finishing 9th. The country slumped to three non top-tens after, &quot;De mallemolen&quot; with Heddy Lester, 12th, &quot;&#x27;t Is OK&quot; with Harmony, 13th, and Xandra, the pseudonym of Sandra Reemer, with &quot;Colorado&quot;, finishing 12th. The Congresgebouw returned to host the after Israel declined hosting after winning twice in a row and withdrew, because the date of the contest coincided with their Remembrance Day. Rogier van Otterloo made a debut as a conductor. Maggie MacNeal entered with the song &quot;Amsterdam&quot;. The song would be the last internally selected song until 2013. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; led the voting after first three twelve points from four countries. The song later slipped to fifth. Linda Williams went to the with &quot;Het is een wonder&quot;, finishing 9th. A year later, The Millionaires&#x27;s &quot;Fantasie eiland&quot; controversially missed the ticket because expert juries sent Bill van Dijk with &quot;Jij en ik&quot;. The English trio Tight Fit covered the song as Fantasy Island, which became a top 5 hit in the UK. Germany&#x27;s five points led &quot;Jij en ik&quot; to finished third last. The is also seen as dramatic. Vulcano&#x27;s &quot;Een beetje van dit&quot; tied with Bernadette&#x27;s &quot;Sing Me a Song&quot; before the last set of the jury votes gave Bernadette one point and Vulcano none, which sent her to Munich. The Netherlands finished 7th. After almost winning the Nationaal Songfestival in 1981, Maribelle represented the country in 1984 with &quot;Ik hou van jou&quot;. The entry finished 13th, preceding the first ever Dutch withdrawal in 1985 due to the Remembrance of the Dead.

===1986–1995: Mixed results leading to relegation===

Marcha finished joint fifth, the Netherlands&#x27;s first top five result since 1980. The song was the last conducted by van Otterloo before his death from cancer. In 1988, Gerard Joling was internally selected as the Dutch representative, and &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was later selected as the Dutch entry. The song finished ninth. Justine Pelmelay, a backing singer for &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, won the selection in 1989 with the song &quot;, which finished 15th. In 1990, The country was represented by sisters Maywood with the power ballad &quot;, again finishing 15th. As the contest was held on 4 May 1991, the Netherlands decided against participating due to the Remembrance of the Dead. Humphrey Campbell won the 1992 selection with &quot;, which finished ninth. In 1993 and 1994, NOS opted to internally select the artist, and used the Nationaal Songfestival to select the song. In 1993, Ruth Jacott was selected as the artist, and &quot; was selected as the entry, finishing sixth. In 1994, Willeke Alberti was selected with the song &quot;&quot;. The song placed 23rd with four points, and the Netherlands were relegated from the 1995 contest.

===1996–2004: A decade of good results===
Nationaal Songfestival returned in 1996 with five semi-finals to select a song for each singer. Maxine and Franklin Brown represented the country with &quot;De eerste keer&quot;. The song finished seventh, after an error. Dick Bakker, co-writer of &quot;Ding-a-dong&quot;, made his debut as a conductor. In 1997, Mrs. Einstein, which the German television jokingly announced as &quot;the Dutch Spice Grandmothers&quot;, represented the Netherlands with &quot;Niemand heeft nog tijd&quot; finishing tied 22nd with five points. The highest-scoring entry that period was Edsilia Rombley&#x27;s &quot;Hemel en aarde&quot;: it even led the voting for some time. It was the last time the Netherlands was leader of the scoreboard until 2014. The song finished fourth, the Netherlands&#x27;s best result since 1975. Marlayne won the Dutch final in 1999. She came joint 8th with the song &quot;One Good Reason&quot;. In 2000, the song &quot;No Goodbyes&quot;, sung by Linda Wagenmakers, placed 13th. In 2001, Michelle and her song &quot;Out on My Own&quot; finished 18th, and the Netherlands was not allowed to participate in 2002 due to poor results. Esther Hart won the national final in 2003 with the same writing team as 1999. Esther finished in 13th place. The country sent the male duo Re-union in 2004 with the song &quot;Without You&quot; and qualified for the final. They placed 20th with 11 points.

===2005–2012: Non-qualification streak===
In 2005, Glennis Grace&#x27;s &quot;My Impossible Dream&quot; failed to reach the grand final. Treble also did not qualify a year later, with their song &quot;Amambanda&quot;. In 2007, Rombley returned with her song &quot;On Top of the World&quot;. She could not repeat her 1998 success and failed to qualify. In 2008, Hind participated with the song &quot;Your Heart Belongs to Me&quot;: she too failed to qualify. In 2009, De Toppers&#x27;s &quot;Shine&quot; failed to qualify. The year after, Sieneke was selected through a national final with &quot;Ik ben verliefd (Sha-la-lie)&quot; sung in Dutch - she also failed to qualify. The 3JS had the lowest score of all participants in the contest, and in , Joan Franka failed to qualify as well. The Netherlands missed out on the final eight years in a row, making it the country with the longest period of non-qualification in the contest.

===2013–2019: Renaissance, qualification streaks and fifth victory===
The string of consecutive non-qualifications of much of the 2000s and early 2010s led the Dutch broadcaster to re-think their strategy, which led to the internal selection of rock singer Anouk in 2013. Anouk chose the song &quot;Birds&quot; and the background singers herself and went on to break the Netherlands&#x27; long non-qualification streak, subsequently giving the country its first top 10 placing since 1999. The following years, the Dutch Eurovision committee continued to choose their artists internally. The year following Anouk, The Common Linnets (consisting of singers Ilse DeLange and Waylon) with &quot;Calm After the Storm&quot; won their semi-final and finished in second place overall. After a non-qualification with Trijntje Oosterhuis in 2015, the Dutch then recorded four consecutive qualifications with Douwe Bob and OG3NE both finishing in 11th place in their respective appearances, and returning singer Waylon placing 18th. Duncan Laurence brought the country its fifth overall victory and first in 44 years with his song &quot;Arcade&quot;.

=== 2020–present ===
As the host entrant in 2021, Jeangu Macrooy with &quot;Birth of a New Age&quot; was pre-qualified for the final, eventually finishing in 23rd place with 11 points, marking the fifth time since 2015 that the host country ranked in the bottom five. Macrooy was previously chosen to represent the country in the later-cancelled 2020 edition with &quot;Grow&quot;. In 2022, S10 represented the country with &quot;De diepte&quot;, the first Dutch-language entry since 2010, and finished in 11th place in the final. This qualification streak was ended the following year, when Mia Nicolai and Dion Cooper failed to advance from the semi-finals. In 2024, Joost Klein qualified from the semi-finals, but was disqualified prior to the final due to an incident involving Klein and a production staff member of the contest.

==Non-participation==
The Netherlands has missed only four contests in its Eurovision history. The country was absent in and due to the date of both contests coinciding with the Dutch Remembrance of the Dead, and in and due to relegation as a result of the country&#x27;s poor results in the previous year.

The Netherlands did compete in , but the broadcast of that year&#x27;s Eurovision final on was halted an hour after it commenced as an explosion in a fireworks factory destroyed parts of a suburb in Enschede a few hours before. The points awarded by the Netherlands were taken from the back-up jury vote, as there was no televote after the program was cut short.

===Heads of delegation===
Each participating broadcaster in the Eurovision Song Contest assigns a head of delegation as the EBU&#x27;s contact person and the leader of their delegation at the event. The delegation, whose size can greatly vary, includes a head of press, the performers, songwriters, composers, and backing vocalists, among others.
===Commentators and spokespersons===

Over the years Dutch commentary has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including Willem Duys, Ivo Niehe, Pim Jacobs, Ati Dijckmeester, and Paul de Leeuw. Willem van Beusekom provided NOS commentary every year from 1987 until 2005 (with the exceptions of 1991 and 1995). He was replaced by his co-commentator Cornald Maas, who commentated on the contest from 2004 until 2010.

On 29 June 2010, Maas was sacked as commentator after posting insults on Twitter about Sieneke, Joran van der Sloot and the Party for Freedom (PVV). After this, DJ Daniël Dekker, who had been commentating next to Maas, took over together with Jan Smit. In 2014, Maas returned, now himself replacing Dekker, as commentator together with Smit. Sander Lantinga replaced Smit for 2021 due to Smit hosting the main contest. In 2024, Smit stepped down as commentator and was replaced by Jacqueline Govaert.

<text>Swantopolk II (; ; 1190/1200 — 11 January 1266), also known as Swantopolk II the Great (; ), was the ruling Duke of Gdańsk from 1215 until his death. He was the first member of the Samborides to style himself from 1227 onwards.

==Names==

The duke is known under many spellings (&quot;Swantepolk, Swantipolk, Svatopluk, Swietopelk, Swatopolk, Sviatopolk, Światopełek, Świętopełk, Swiãtopôłk&quot;), of which &quot;Domin(us) Zwantepolc(us) D(ux) Danceke&quot; and &quot;Svantopelc Ducis Pomeranie&quot; were used on seals.

==Biography==
Swietopelk was the son of the Pomeranian duke Mestwin I and his wife Swinisława. His father had ruled over Eastern Pomerania (or Pomerelia) since about 1205 by appointment of the Polish high duke Władysław III Spindleshanks. In 1216 or 1217 his son Swietopelk was made a steward over Pomerelia by High Duke Leszek I the White of Kraków. He was responsible for the Gdańsk territory, the largest of the four portions of Pomerelia. In 1218, Swietopelk took advantage of a revolt of local knights against Danish rule to occupy the Lands of Schlawe and Stolp. After his brother Warcislaw died without heirs, Swietopelk took over his Lubiszewo Tczewskie.

Upon their father&#x27;s death, Swietopelk&#x27;s brothers Sambor and Racibor were still young, so he acted as their guardian. As they came of age, the brothers received their share of inheritance: Sambor received Lubiszewo Tczewskie and Racibor received Białogard.

Swietopelk, who had exploited Piast Poland&#x27;s fragmentation to gain independence, promised Władysław Odonic the throne of Kraków and Silesia in exchange for his support in the ousting of Leszek and Henry I the Bearded of Lower Silesia . On 23 November 1227, on the occasion of an assembly of Piast dukes in Gąsawa, Leszek was killed in an ambush set by Swietopelk II and perhaps Władysław, while Henry was severely wounded.

In 1233-34, Swietopelk II, with his brother Sambor, joined a crusading army along with Hermann Balk, Konrad I of Masovia, Henry the Bearded, and Władysław Odonic. They proceeded to Kwidzyn (Marienwerder) and refortified it for the Teutonic Order. After this task was over, the crusaders met the pagan Prussians, the Pomesanians, at the battle of the River Sorge. There, they defeated the pagans, and were able to seize greater control of south Prussia.

In 1238 Swietopelk conquered the Duchy of Pomerania-Schlawe, whose territories connected Pomerania to Gdańsk, Nakło, and Bydgoszcz. This guaranteed war with Kujavia. The brothers, over whom Swantopolk was supposed to govern for twenty years, refused to support their overlord after twelve years, and the conflict escalated into a civil war. Sambor and Racibor were driven out from their lands and sought refuge and alliance first with Piast relatives in Greater Poland, later with the Teutonic Knights, a Christian military order waging a crusade against pagan Prussians. There were also economic tensions between the Knights and Swantopolk. This resulted in an alliance with the heathen Prussians. Swantopolk played a key role in the First Prussian Uprising, which started in 1242.

The alliance between the pagan Prussians and the Christian Swietopelk against a religious order supported by the pope was unexpected. Swietopelk was previously known as a supporter of the Roman Catholic Church and Christian causes. Eventually, the uprising did not succeed and a peace treaty, mediated by a papal legate, was signed on 24 November 1248. Swietopelk had to return lands seized from his brothers, allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains, stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula, and stop any aid to the Prussians. He kept his word and did not assist the Prussians during their Great Uprising (1260–1274).

After governing since 1220 for 46 years, Swietopelk died in 1266, with his sons Mestwin II and Wartislaw II inheriting his lands.

<doc id="530877" wikidata="Q6286885" url="?curid=530877" title="Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company">
<text>Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company is an American brewery based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and was once the largest producer of beer in the United States. Its namesake beer, Schlitz (), was known as &quot;The beer that made Milwaukee famous&quot; and was advertised with the slogan &quot;When you&#x27;re out of Schlitz, you&#x27;re out of beer&quot;. Schlitz first became the largest beer producer in the US in 1902 and enjoyed that status at several points during the first half of the 20th century, exchanging the title with Anheuser-Busch multiple times during the 1950s.

The company was founded by August Krug in 1849, but ownership passed to Joseph Schlitz in 1858 when he married Krug&#x27;s widow. Schlitz was bought by Stroh Brewery Company in 1982 and subsequently sold along with the rest of Stroh&#x27;s assets to Pabst Brewing Company in 1999. Pabst produced several varieties of Schlitz beers alongside Old Milwaukee.

On November 13, 2014, Pabst announced that it had completed its sale to Blue Ribbon Intermediate Holdings, LLC. Blue Ribbon is a partnership between American beer entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and TSG Consumer Partners, a San Francisco–based, private-equity firm. Prior reports suggested the price agreed upon was around $700 million.

==History==
===Beginnings===

In Milwaukee, Joseph Schlitz was hired as a bookkeeper in a tavern brewery owned by August Krug. In 1856, he took over management of the brewery following the death of Krug. In 1858, Schlitz married the widow, Anna Maria Krug, and then changed the name of the brewery to the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. in 1861, Krug&#x27;s 16-year-old nephew, August Uihlein, began employment at the brewery.

The often circulated story of Schlitz&#x27; proposed donation of thousands of barrels of beer to the Chicago population after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 is simply a modern myth, pushed by later marketing campaigns. Schlitz&#x27; national expansion was based on new distribution points in Chicago and elsewhere, and the consequent use of the railway. From the late 1880s, Schlitz built dozens of tied houses in Chicago, most with a concrete relief of the company logo embedded in the brickwork; several of these buildings survive today, including the Lake Street Schlitz Tied House at the corner of Lake and Loomis and Schuba&#x27;s Tavern at the corner of Belmont and Southport. In 1873, Schlitz rejected a purchase offer from Tennessee brewer Bratton and Sons.

In 1875, Schlitz returned to his homeland on the SS Schiller. While returning home, the ship hit a rock near the Isles of Scilly and sank, killing Schlitz and 334 others. His body was never recovered. Honoring Krug&#x27;s wishes, Schlitz had it written in his own will that he also wanted the Uihlein brothers to run the brewery when he died. Management was promptly passed to the four Uihlein brothers, August, Henry, Alfred and Edward. When Anna Maria Krug Schlitz died in 1887, the Uihleins acquired complete ownership of the firm, and the Uihlein family continued to run the brewery for over one hundred years. Despite this change, the Uihleins decided to keep the name Schlitz, as Americans had difficulty pronouncing their surname.

===Prohibition and success===
The company flourished through much of the 1900s, starting in 1902 when the production of one million barrels of beer surpassed Pabst&#x27;s claim as the largest brewery in the United States. Schlitz began pioneering numerous advances in the brewing industry, most notably the use of brown glass bottles beginning in 1912. Previously, beer was bottled in clear glass bottles, but this allowed sunlight to spoil the flavor of the beer. The entire industry quickly adopted the brown bottle, and the design is still used to this day. Schlitz&#x27;s pioneering of the brown bottle was the inspiration for the Schlitz Brown Bottle Restaurant in Milwaukee, which opened in 1938.

However, their success would meet the first of several major obstacles. In the early 1900s, the temperance movement was gaining traction, and production and consumption of alcohol was eventually outlawed entirely with the passage of Prohibition in the United States in 1920. During Prohibition, Schlitz faced difficulties trying to stay open and keep their workers employed. In 1919, with Prohibition imminent, Joseph E. Uihlein Sr. created a division of Schlitz that would produce milk chocolate, looking to make good use of Wisconsin&#x27;s large dairy industry. The chocolate was sold under the &quot;Eline&quot; brand (the phonetic pronunciation of Uihlein). However, Eline Chocolate did not have much success, as the Hershey company was dominant in the highly competitive chocolate industry, and Eline candies were often rife with quality control problems. Despite pouring millions into the chocolate division and creating a hard candy and gumball line, the venture was a failure and was abandoned by 1928. 

This forced the company to change its name from Schlitz Brewing Company to the Schlitz Beverage Company and changed its &quot;famous&quot; slogan to &quot;The drink that made Milwaukee famous.&quot; Schlitz primarily focused on producing malt extract and non-alcoholic soft drinks called &quot;Schlitz Famo&quot; that they used to keep the brewing equipment operational, as the Uihleins correctly deduced that Prohibition would not be permanent. After Prohibition ended in late 1933, Schlitz again began producing beer and quickly became the world&#x27;s top-selling brewery in 1934.

===First union strike and decline===
In 1953, Milwaukee brewery workers went on a 76-day strike. The strike greatly impacted Schlitz&#x27;s production, including all of Milwaukee&#x27;s other breweries and allowed Anheuser-Busch to surpass Schlitz in the American beer market. The popularity of Schlitz&#x27;s namesake beer, along with the introduction of value-priced Old Milwaukee, allowed Schlitz to regain the number-one position. Schlitz and Anheuser-Busch continued to compete for the top brewery in America for years. Schlitz remained the number-two brewery in America as late as 1976.

By 1967, the company&#x27;s president and chairman was August Uihlein&#x27;s grandson, Robert Uihlein Jr. Faced with a desire to meet large volume demands while also cutting the cost of production, the brewing process for Schlitz&#x27;s flagship Schlitz beer was changed in the early 1970s. The primary changes involved using corn syrup to replace some of the malted barley, adding a silica gel to prevent the product from forming a haze, using high-temperature fermentation instead of the traditional method, and also substituted less-expensive extracts rather than traditional ingredients. Schlitz also experimented with continuous fermentation, even building a new brewery specifically designed to use the process in Baldwinsville, New York. The reformulated product resulted in a beer that not only lost much of the flavor and consistency of the traditional formula, but also spoiled more quickly, rapidly losing public appeal.

In 1976, concern was growing that the Food and Drug Administration would require all ingredients to be labeled on their bottles and cans. To prevent having to disclose the artificial additive of the silica gel, Uihlein switched to an agent called &quot;Chill-garde&quot; which would be filtered out at the end of production, so it would be considered nondisclosable. The agent reacted badly with a foam stabilizer that was used and Schlitz recalled 10 million bottles of beer, costing it $1.4 million. Schlitz was further hurt by the rise of high-volume light beers such as Miller Lite and Bud Light, a direction Schlitz did not aggressively pursue – although James Coburn appeared in commercials for the short-lived &quot;Schlitz Light&quot; in 1976.

As part of its efforts to reverse the sales decline, Schlitz launched a disastrous 1977 television ad campaign created by Leo Burnett &amp; Co. In each of the ads, an off-screen speaker tries to convince a Schlitz drinker to switch to a rival beer. The Schlitz drinker then talked about how they would never switch and jokingly threatened the person trying to persuade them away from their favorite beer. Despite the tone of the campaign intending to be comedic levity, audiences found the campaign somewhat menacing and the ad industry dubbed it &quot;Drink Schlitz or I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot; Schlitz, unwilling to endure more bad press, pulled the campaign after 10 weeks and fired Burnett.

===Second union strike and sale to Stroh===
By the 1980s, Schlitz had rebounded somewhat, but it had now fallen from the second-most-popular brewery in the country to the fourth, as Miller and Pabst had overtaken it for the first time in decades. The final blow to the company was another crippling strike at the Milwaukee plant in 1981. About 700 production workers went on strike on June 1, 1981. The strike was triggered because there was no replacement contract when the union&#x27;s contract expired. 

The strike lasted for almost four months, and the company quickly abandoned all remaining hope that it could be saved, as all previous attempts were utter failures and the strikes had now crippled the company&#x27;s production line and finances. The Schlitz management team finally threw in the towel and began negotiating a deal to sell the company and cut their losses. As the Milwaukee plant was the oldest and least efficient of the Schlitz breweries, and unable to afford to keep operating it due to the strike, Schlitz closed the doors to the Milwaukee brewery, thus ending the strike and, ultimately, signaling the end for Schlitz being one of the most popular beer companies in America. Also during that time, the &quot;No One Does It Like the Bull&quot; ad campaign was introduced. It featured music groups such as Kool and the Gang (who appeared in three of those commercials), the Drifters, Teddy Pendergrass, the Average White Band, Dr. Hook, the Platters, the Lettermen, Tommy James and the Shondells, the Four Tops, the Marshall Tucker Band and .38 Special engaging in a &quot;battle of the bands&quot;-like atmosphere before the bull storms into the room.

The Baldwinsville brewery was purchased by Anheuser-Busch in 1981 to supplement production of the upcoming Budweiser Light – now Bud Light – release in 1982. Because of the nonstandard brewery design, Baldwinsville is unique and capable of complex production, making it a key player in the 12 domestic Anheuser-Busch plants. In 1982, there were competing bids for ownership of the Schlitz brand. The Stroh Brewery Company of Detroit, Michigan beat out Pabst and Heileman by bidding for 67 percent of Schlitz. By spring of that year, Stroh had purchased the entire company, making Stroh&#x27;s the third largest brewing enterprise in America. During the takeover, Schlitz fought a fierce battle in the courts trying to remain independent. 

Schlitz finally accepted the takeover when Stroh raised its offer from an initial $16 per share to $17, and the U.S. Justice Department approved the acquisition once Stroh agreed to sell either Schlitz&#x27;s Memphis or Winston-Salem breweries. The Milwaukee Schlitz Brewhouse stood unused after the sale to Stroh, until it was demolished in 2013. What remained of the historic Schlitz Brewery complex in Milwaukee was transformed with tax increment financing and other government support into a mixed-use development called Schlitz Park.

===Pabst acquisition and revival===
The once-strong Schlitz brand was relegated to cheap beer or &quot;bargain brand&quot; status and became increasingly difficult to find in bars and restaurants. Ironically enough, Stroh itself was beginning to struggle from the weight of its business, and it had never been able to get out from under the debt it incurred when purchasing Schlitz. In 1999, Pabst Brewing Company gained control of the Schlitz brand with its acquisition of the Stroh Brewery Company.
During the reformulating period of the early 1970s, the original Schlitz beer formula was lost and never included in any of the subsequent sales of the company. Through research of documents and interviews with former Schlitz brewmasters and taste-testers, Pabst was able to reconstruct the 1960s classic formula. The new Schlitz beer, along with a new television advertising campaign, was officially introduced in 2008. The first markets for relaunching included Chicago, Florida, Boston, Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and Schlitz&#x27;s former headquarters, Milwaukee. The classic 1960s theme was also reflected when 1968 &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine playmate Cynthia Myers became a spokeswoman for Schlitz beer in 2009.

In 2014, Pabst Brewing Company was purchased by American entrepreneur Eugene Kashper and TSG Consumer Partners. The deal included the Schlitz brand, as well as Pabst Blue Ribbon, Old Milwaukee, and Colt 45.

Pabst Brewing Company, now headquartered in San Antonio, continues to produce Schlitz beer, Old Milwaukee, and four Schlitz malt liquors—Schlitz Red Bull, Schlitz Bull Ice, Schlitz High Gravity, and Schlitz Malt Liquor. Although it has fallen from its former title as one of America&#x27;s most popular beers, the Schlitz brand is still alive today and remains a sentimental favorite in the Midwest.

<doc id="530878" wikidata="Q5771556" url="?curid=530878" title="Hiroyuki Sakai">
<text>is a Japanese chef who specializes in French cuisine. Sakai is best known as the second, final, and longest-serving Iron Chef French on the Japanese television show &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, first appearing at the beginning of 1994 (after Yutaka Ishinabe retired) and continuing to appear over the show&#x27;s nine further seasons. Sakai has the third best winning percentage of the Iron Chefs, trailing only his Iron Chef French predecessor, Yutaka Ishinabe and the first Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba. He was named the &quot;King of Iron Chefs&quot; after emerging victorious from the show&#x27;s grand finale, a tournament involving all the active Iron Chefs. He went on to defeat the top chef in the world, Alain Passard, in the final Long-Gang Chicken battle. His record on Iron Chef is 70–15–1.

His television trademark is a red French chef&#x27;s costume; he rises into Kitchen Stadium holding a yonashi (&quot;Western Pear&quot;) in his hand. He is often described as the &quot;Delacroix of French cuisine&quot; because of the presentation of his dishes. His formidable record in fish challenges led to fans of the show giving him the nickname, &quot;Seafood Sakai&quot;.

== Career ==

Sakai was originally asked to be on &quot;Iron Chef&quot; by the producer Toshihiko Matsuo following the recommendation from hotel restaurateur Kihachi Kumagai. Sakai agreed after being convinced by his staff, believing the impression that the show would air for another six months, giving him two or three appearances. The six-month tenure, as it turned out, turned into six years. The early era of &quot;Iron Chef&quot; saw Sakai being the &quot;middle Iron Chef&quot; along with Rokusaburo Michiba, a chef twelve years his senior, and Chen Kenichi, the youngest and least experienced of the three Iron Chefs at the time. It is often viewed by fans as the period when &quot;Iron Chef&quot; had the strongest Iron Chefs.

Reactions to Sakai&#x27;s appointment to Iron Chef were largely negative amongst chefs circles, largely because of the low stature of &quot;Iron Chef&quot; among chefs at the time which led many to believe would ruin their reputations as chefs, but others also believing that there was no possibility that any French dish would take less than one hour to prepare. However, as the show became more popular, chefs, judges, and fans became more supportive. It was said that Sakai&#x27;s son&#x27;s employer had his employees frequent the restaurant as a show of support.

Like many chefs, Sakai did not take to losing very well. Upon his first loss, he had tried to be cheerful in explaining his loss to a younger chef who also owned his own restaurant, but his entire staff was mortified upon hearing the news. His daughter was teased in school whenever Sakai had lost - although this was a fairly rare occurrence. In an effort to learn from others, Sakai often tasted food opponents had prepared, or grabbed assistants and asked them questions after the battle was over.

Outside of &quot;Iron Chef&quot;, Sakai is the owner and head chef of the restaurant &quot;La Rochelle&quot;, in Aoyama. The restaurant was named after La Rochelle, a city in France where Sakai had spent some time as an apprentice. Sakai is a member of the Club des Trente, an organization of French chefs in Japan. Sakai was mentored by the Japan&#x27;s pioneer of French Cooking, Fujio Shido for three years.

After the series&#x27; run, Sakai appeared in several &quot;Iron Chef&quot; specials. In the &quot;New York Special&quot;, he gave a presentation to the Culinary Institute of America on the preparation of salmon, assisted by Iron Chef Italian Masahiko Kobe. He also appeared on &quot;Iron Chef America : Battle of the Masters,&quot; where he lost a trout battle to Bobby Flay (during which he created a trout-flavored ice cream) and teamed up with Mario Batali in a seafood battle.

In 2009, Sakai was named a recipient of the Gendai no Meiko (Contemporary Master Craftsmen) awards, honoring Japan&#x27;s foremost artisans in various fields.

In 2010, Sakai was a guest judge for the &quot;MasterChef Australia&quot; season 2 finals week.

In 2013, Sakai was a Guest of Iron Chef for the &quot;Iron Chef Thailand&quot;.

==Memorable battles==
* Guy Shokr – Sakai&#x27;s debut battle which he defeated Shokr with oysters as the theme 
* Club Mistral – This club headed by Masahiro Miyamoto, challenged Sakai on several occasions. However, only one challenger, Kazutaka Okabe, defeated Sakai (in Battle Lamb) on June 9, 1995. All of the other challengers, including Isao Yanagidate (caviar), Tatsu Shimada (truffle), and Seiji Toyoshima (milk) lost to Sakai over the span of 3 years. The Iron Chef&#x27;s record against Mistral is 3-1 (not including Iron Chef Ishinabe&#x27;s win).
*Toshiro Kandagawa – Battled Sakai twice, once in 1995 for the 100th Challengers special using Lotus Root (losing to Sakai), and once in 2001 for the 21st Century Special using Red Snapper (defeating Sakai).
*Rory Kennedy – Iron Chef Sakai had his only overtime battle against this man on January 24, 1997. Kennedy, a gibier chef, was handed the theme European Rabbit. Sakai managed to force overtime, tied at 71 points each. In the overtime session, Sakai used European Pigeon to defeat Kennedy.
*Iron Chef Chinese Chen Kenichi – Sakai battled Chen two times, once for the 1995 Mr. Iron Chef Semifinal using Chicken (losing to Chen on a 3–2 decision), and for the King of Iron Chefs Tournament Final in 1999 using Homard Lobster (defeated Chen by a 3–2 decision, with a deciding vote by former Iron Chef Michiba).
*Alain Passard – After Passard tied Iron Chef Komei Nakamura in the Foie Gras battle in the 1997 World Cup, Sakai faced him after winning the King of Iron Chefs Tournament in 1999. Using Long-Gang Chicken, he made four dishes that impressed the judges and won him a 3-2 judges decision to be the #1 chef in the world.

<doc id="530887" wikidata="Q2431716" url="?curid=530887" title="Fischer–Speier esterification">
<text>Fischer esterification or Fischer–Speier esterification is a special type of esterification by refluxing a carboxylic acid and an alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. The reaction was first described by Emil Fischer and Arthur Speier in 1895. Most carboxylic acids are suitable for the reaction, but the alcohol should generally be primary or secondary. Tertiary alcohols are prone to elimination. Contrary to common misconception found in organic chemistry textbooks, phenols can also be esterified to give good to near quantitative yield of products. Commonly used catalysts for a Fischer esterification include sulfuric acid, &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonic acid, and Lewis acids such as scandium(III) triflate. For more valuable or sensitive substrates (for example, biomaterials) other, milder procedures such as Steglich esterification are used. The reaction is often carried out without a solvent (particularly when a large reagent excess of the alcohol reagent is used) or in a non-polar solvent (e.g. toluene, hexane) that can facilitate Dean–Stark distillation to remove the water byproduct. Typical reaction times vary from 1–10 hours at temperatures of 60–110 °C.

Direct acylations of alcohols with carboxylic acids is preferred over acylations with anhydrides (poor atom economy of the reaction) or acid chlorides (moisture sensitive reagents). The main disadvantage of direct acylation is the unfavorable chemical equilibrium that must be remedied (e.g. by a large excess of one of the reagents), or by the removal of water (e.g. by using Dean–Stark distillation or including a drying agent such as anhydrous salts, molecular sieves, or a large amount of certain acids as catalyst in the reaction mixture).

==Overview==
Fischer esterification is an acyl substitution reaction based on the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon and the nucleophilicity of an alcohol. Carboxylic acids tend to be deprotonated by nucleophiles, which gives an unreactive carboxylate. Although kinetically very stable in the absence of catalysts, esters tend to eventually hydrolyse in the presence of water.

Several steps can be taken to turn this unfavourable reaction into a favourable one.

The reaction mechanism for this reaction has several steps:
# Proton transfer from acid catalyst to carbonyl oxygen increases electrophilicity of carbonyl carbon.
# The carbonyl carbon is then attacked by the nucleophilic oxygen atom of the alcohol
# Proton transfer from the oxonium ion to a second molecule of the alcohol gives an activated complex
# Protonation of one of the hydroxy groups of the activated complex gives a new oxonium ion.
# Loss of water from this oxonium ion and subsequent deprotonation gives the ester.

A generic mechanism for an acid Fischer esterification is shown below.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

===Advantages===
The primary advantages of Fischer esterification compared to other esterification processes are based on its relative simplicity. Straightforward acidic conditions can be used if acid-sensitive functional groups are not an issue; sulfuric acid can be used; weaker acids can be used with a tradeoff of longer reaction times. Because the reagents used are &quot;direct,&quot; there is less environmental impact in terms of waste products and harmfulness of the reagents. Alkyl halides are potential greenhouse gases or ozone depletors, carcinogens, and possible ecological poisons. Acid chlorides evolve hydrogen chloride gas upon contact with atmospheric moisture, are corrosive, react vigorously with water and other nucleophiles (sometimes dangerously); they are easily quenched by other nucleophiles besides the desired alcohol; their most common synthesis routes involve the evolution of toxic carbon monoxide or sulfur dioxide gases (depending on the synthesis process used).

Acid anhydrides are more reactive than esters because the leaving group is a carboxylate anion—a better leaving group than an alkoxide anion because their negative charge is more delocalised. However, such routes generally result in poor atom economy. For example, in reacting ethanol with acetic anhydride, ethyl acetate forms and acetic acid is eliminated as a leaving group, which is considerably less reactive than an acid anhydride and will be left as a byproduct (in a wasteful 1:1 ratio with the ester product) if product is collected immediately. If conditions are acidic enough, the acetic acid can be further reacted via the Fischer esterification pathway, but at a much slower pace. However, in many carefully designed syntheses, reagents can be designed such that acid anhydrides are generated in situ and carboxylic acid byproducts are reactivated, and Fischer esterification routes are not necessarily mutually exclusive with acetic anhydride routes. Examples of this include the common undergraduate organic lab experiment involving the acetylation of salicylic acid to yield aspirin.

Fischer esterification is primarily a thermodynamically-controlled process: because of its slowness, the most stable ester tends to be the major product. This can be a desirable trait if there are multiple reaction sites and side product esters to be avoided. In contrast, rapid reactions involving acid anhydrides or acid chlorides are often kinetically-controlled.

===Disadvantages===
The primary disadvantages of Fischer esterification routes are its thermodynamic reversibility and relatively slow reaction rates—often on the scale of several hours to years, depending on the reaction conditions. Workarounds to this can be inconvenient if there are other functional groups sensitive to strong acid, in which case other catalytic acids may be chosen. If the product ester has a lower boiling point than either water or the reagents, the product may be distilled rather than water; this is common as esters with no protic functional groups tend to have lower boiling points than their protic parent reagents. Purification and extraction are easier if the ester product can be distilled away from the reagents and byproducts, but reaction rate can be slowed because overall reaction temperature can be limited in this scenario. A more inconvenient scenario is if the reagents have a lower boiling point than either the ester product or water, in which case the reaction mixture must be capped and refluxed and a large excess of starting material added. In this case anhydrous salts, such as copper(II) sulfate or potassium pyrosulfate, can also be added to sequester the water by forming hydrates, shifting the equilibrium towards ester products. The reaction mixture containing the product can then be decanted or filtered to remove the drying agent prior to the final workup.

==In wine aging==
The natural esterification that takes place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate—the ester of ethanol and acetic acid—is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate.

==Variations==
Tetrabutylammonium tribromide (TBATB) can serve as an effective but unconventional catalyst for this reaction. It is believed that hydrobromic acid released by TBATB protonates the alcohol rather than the carboxylic acid, making the carboxylate the actual nucleophile. This would be a reversal of the standard esterification mechanism. An example of this method is the acylation of 3-phenylpropanol using glacial acetic acid and TBATB. The reaction generates the ester in 15 minutes in a 95% yield without the need to remove water.

<text>Cem Sultan (also spelled Djem or Jem) or Sultan Cem or Şehzade Cem (22 December 1459 – 25 February 1495, ; ; ; ), was a claimant to the Ottoman throne in the 15th century.

Cem was the third son of Sultan Mehmed II and younger half-brother of Sultan Bayezid II, and thus a half-uncle of Sultan Selim I of Ottoman Empire.

After being defeated by Bayezid, Cem went in exile in Egypt and Europe, under the protection of the Mamluks, the Knights Hospitaller of St. John on the island of Rhodes, and ultimately the Pope.

== Early life ==
Cem was born on 22 December 1459 in Edirne. His mother was Çiçek Hatun. In accordance with the custom for a Şehzade (prince) Cem was appointed to a provincial governorship of Kastamonu in 1469. In December 1474, Cem replaced his deceased brother Mustafa as governor of Karaman in Konya.

==Succession dispute==
At the death of Mehmed the Conqueror, on 3 May 1481, Bayezid was the governor of Sivas, Tokat and Amasya, and Cem ruled the provinces of Karaman and Konya. With no designated heir after Mehmed, conflict over succession to the throne erupted between Cem and Bayezid.

Contrary to Islamic law, which prohibits any unnecessary delay in burial, Mehmed II&#x27;s body was transported to Constantinople, where it lay three days. His grand vizier Karamanlı Mehmet Pasha – believing himself to be fulfilling the wishes of the recently deceased Sultan – attempted to arrange a situation whereby the younger son Cem, whose governing seat at Konya was closer than his brother Bayezid&#x27;s seat at Amasya, would arrive in Constantinople prior to his older sibling and be able to claim the throne.

However, Bayezid had already established a political network of influential pashas (two of whom were his sons-in-law), the janissaries, and those opposed to the policies of Mehmed II and the grand vizier. In spite of Karamanlı Mehmet Pasha&#x27;s attempts at secrecy, the Sultan&#x27;s death and the grand vizier&#x27;s plan were discovered by the Janissary corps, who supported Bayezid over Cem and had been kept out of the capital after the Sultan&#x27;s death. As a result, the Janissary corps rebelled, entering the capital, and lynched the grand vizier.
After the death of Karamanlı Mehmet Pasha, there was widespread rioting among the janissaries in Constantinople as there was neither a sultan nor a grand vizier to control the developments. Understanding the danger of the situation, former grand vizier Ishak Pasha took the initiative of beseeching Bayezid to arrive with all due haste. In the meantime, Ishak Pasha took the cautionary measure of proclaiming Bayezid&#x27;s 11-year-old son, Sehzade (prince) Korkut, as regent until the arrival of his father.

Prince Bayezid arrived at Constantinople on 21 May 1481, and was declared Sultan Bayezid II. Only six days later, Cem captured the city of Inegöl with an army of 4,000. Sultan Bayezid sent his army under the command of vizier Ayas Pasha to kill his brother. On 28 May Cem had defeated Bayezid&#x27;s army and declared himself Sultan of Anatolia, establishing his capital at Bursa. He proposed to divide the empire between him and his brother, leaving Bayezid the European side. Bayezid furiously rejected the proposal, declared that &quot;between rulers there is no kinship,&quot; and marched on to Bursa. The decisive battle between the two contenders to the Ottoman throne took place on 19 June 1481, near the town of Yenişehir. Cem lost and fled with his family to the Mamluk Cairo.

== In Cairo ==
The Mamlūk sultan Qāʾit Bāy (r. 1468–1496) received Cem with honour in Cairo, and Cem took the opportunity to go on pilgrimage to Mecca, making him the only Ottoman prince to have made the pilgrimage.

In Cairo, Cem received a letter from his brother, offering Cem one million akçes (the Ottoman currency) to stop competing for the throne. Cem rejected the offer, and in the following year he launched a campaign in Anatolia under the support of Kasım Bey (Qāsım Beğ), heir of the ruling house of Karaman, and the &quot;sanjek bey&quot; of Ankara. On 27 May 1482 Cem besieged Konya but was soon defeated and forced to withdraw to Ankara. He intended to give it all up and return to Cairo but all of the roads to Egypt were under Bayezid&#x27;s control. Cem then tried to renegotiate with his brother. Bayezid offered him a stipend to live quietly in Jerusalem but refused to divide the empire, prompting Cem to flee to Rhodes on 29 July 1482.

==Imprisonment==
===Knights Hospitaller===

Upon arriving at Rhodes, Cem asked the protection of the French captain of Bodrum Castle, Pierre d&#x27;Aubusson, grand master of the Knights of St. John, the Latin Catholic order on the island. On 29 July Cem arrived at Rhodes and was received with honor. In return for the overthrow of the new sultan Bayezid, Prince Cem offered perpetual peace between the Ottoman Empire and Christendom if he regained the Ottoman throne. However, Pierre d&#x27;Aubusson realized that conflict with Bayezid would be imprudent, so he secretly approached Bayezid, concluded a peace treaty, and then reached a separate agreement on Cem&#x27;s captivity in March 1483. D&#x27;Aubusson promised Bayezid to detain Cem in return for an annual payment of 40,000 ducats for his maintenance.

Therefore, the Knights took the money and betrayed Cem, who thereafter became a well-treated prisoner at Rhodes. Afterwards, Cem was sent to the castle of Pierre d&#x27;Aubusson in France.

=== France ===

Cem had reached Nice, at that time in the Duchy of Savoy, on 17 October 1482, en route to Hungary, but the Knights were playing for time. After the agreement about his confinement was finalised, he became a hostage, as well as a potential pawn. Those who hoped to use his name and person to foment turmoil in the Ottoman realm included the Mamlūk sultan Qāʾit Bāy, Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, and Pope Innocent VIII. Others, such as the Knights of Saint John, the Venetians, the king of Naples, and Popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI, viewed his presence in Europe as a deterrent to Ottoman aggression against Christendom and an opportunity for profit. For his part, Bayezid II dispatched ambassadors and spies to the West to assure that his rival was detained indefinitely, and he even attempted to eliminate him through assassination.

Cem spent a year in the Duchy of Savoy. After the death of King Louis XI of France (30 August 1483), who had refused to accept a Muslim in his lands, the Knights of Saint John transferred him to Limousin (D&#x27;Aubusson&#x27;s birthplace). Cem spent the next five years there, mostly at Bourganeuf. He was well treated, but essentially a captive (a fortified tower was constructed to house him). Bayezid II negotiated both with D&#x27;Aubusson, to have Cem returned to Rhodes, and with representatives of the new French monarch, Charles VIII, to have him kept in France. When the king of Hungary and Pope Innocent VIII sought custody of the prince, the Pope prevailed, and Cem arrived in Rome on 13 March 1489.

===Rome===

Innocent VIII rebuffed overtures from the Mamlūks and prepared to launch a crusade against the Ottomans, but it was postponed when Matthias Corvinus of Hungary died on 6 April 1490. These developments worried Bayezid, who contacted D&#x27;Aubusson and also sent Mustafa Bey (later a grand vizier) to Rome, to conclude a secret agreement, in December 1490. The sultan promised not to attack Rhodes, Rome, or Venice, as well as to pay Cem&#x27;s allowance of 40,000 ducats to the Pope (10,000 of which were earmarked for the Knights of Saint John), in return for the prince&#x27;s incarceration. Apparently, Cem found life in Rome more pleasant than in France, and he had lost hope of seizing the Ottoman throne, but he wanted to die in a Muslim land. His wish would not be realized.

Pope Innocent VIII unsuccessfully attempted to use Cem to begin a new crusade against the Ottomans. The Pope also tried to convert Cem to Christianity, without success. Cem&#x27;s presence in Rome was useful nevertheless, because whenever Bayezid intended to launch a military campaign against Christian nations of the Balkans, the Pope would threaten to release his brother.

In exchange for maintaining the custody of Cem, Bayezid paid Innocent VIII 120,000 crowns (at the time, equal to all other annual sources of papal revenue combined), a relic of the Holy Lance (which allegedly had pierced the side of Christ), one hundred Moorish slaves, and an annual fee of 45,000 ducats. Much of the costs associated with the Sistine Chapel were paid with funds from the Ottoman ransoms.

==Death==

In 1494, Charles VIII invaded Italy, to take possession of the Kingdom of Naples, and also announced a crusade against the Turks. He compelled Pope Alexander VI to surrender Cem, who left Rome with the French army on 28 January 1495. The prince died in Naples on 24 February. Some accounts attribute his death to poison, but he probably succumbed to pneumonia.

Sultan Bayezid declared national mourning for three days. He also requested to have Cem&#x27;s body for an Islamic funeral, but it was not until four years after Cem&#x27;s death that his body was finally brought to the Ottoman lands because of attempts to receive more gold for Cem&#x27;s corpse. He was buried in Bursa.

==Legacy==
===Personality===
Cem had two diwans in Turkish and Persian, and he also spoke Arabic.

*Ayşe Hatun, married in 1503 Mehmed Bey, son of Sinan Pasha, Sanjak-bey of Ioannina

==Treatments and references==

=== In literature ===
In the 1490s, a book in Latin was written about Cem&#x27;s life. It was illustrated by Guillaume Caoursin, vice-chancellor of the Knights Hospitaller. It was published in several European cities that possessed printing capability: Venice, Paris, Bruges, Salamanca, Ulm and London. The many illustrations in the book are the first accurately described representations in Western Europe of costumes and weapons of the Turkish people.

An account of Cem&#x27;s captivity—and of the political machinations that kept him captive—forms the basis of the historical novel, &quot;Francesca: Les Jeux du Sort&quot; (1872), written by the Haitian writer and political exile, Demesvar Delorme.

Cem&#x27;s life also served as inspiration for a character in the book &quot;The Damned Yard&quot; (1954) by the Yugoslav Nobelist writer Ivo Andrić. It is widely considered to be one of his masterpieces and has been translated into over 30 languages. Cem Sultan appears as one of the main characters in a multiple-layered narration and serves as a metaphor for the human condition. 

Bulgarian Ottoman historian Vera Mutafchieva, inspired by Cem Sultan&#x27;s importance in European politics of the 15th century, wrote a novel (&quot;The Case of Cem&quot;) about him in 1967. The book strives for historical accuracy and has been translated into Turkish, German, Romanian, Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, French, Estonian, Greek and Croatian. An English translation by Angela Rodel was published in 2024.

=== In film ===
In 1951, was released historical film &quot;Cem Sultan&quot;, which main protagonist was portrayed by Bülent Ufuk.

In 1969 was released historical adventure film &quot;Malkoçoğlu Cem Sultan&quot;, which directed by Remzi Aydın Jöntürk, the character of Cem Sultan, was portrayed by Cihangir Ghaffari.

=== In television ===
* In the Showtime series &quot;The Borgias&quot;, Cem is played by British actor Elyes Gabel, and is depicted in Rome under the papacy of Innocent VIII&#x27;s successor, Pope Alexander VI. He is also portrayed to have sought to convert to Christianity, and to have been assassinated by Alexander VI&#x27;s son, Juan Borgia.
* In the Canal+ series &quot;Borgia&quot;, the character of Cem, played by Nicolás Belmonte, dies from fever when traveling with Cesare Borgia in Charles&#x27; campaign against Naples.
* In the MBC series &quot;Kingdoms of Fire&quot;, Cem fought against Bayezid II, then he sought refuge with the crusaders, who agreed to host him in exchange to annual tribute from the Ottoman Sultan.

=== In video games ===
* In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Revelations&quot;, Cem was mentioned to possess an Apple of Eden, then he became a Templar acquainted with Rodrigo Borgia, however, he was eventually killed by the Assassins.

<doc id="530896" wikidata="Q8014455" url="?curid=530896" title="Flux pinning">
<text>Flux pinning is a phenomenon that occurs when flux vortices in a type-II superconductor are prevented from moving within the bulk of the superconductor, so that the magnetic field lines are &quot;pinned&quot; to those locations. The superconductor must be a type-II superconductor because type-I superconductors cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields. Some type-I superconductors can experience the effects of flux pinning if they are thin enough. If the material&#x27;s thickness is comparable to the London penetration depth, the magnetic field can pass through the material. The act of magnetic penetration is what makes flux pinning possible. At higher magnetic fields (above lower critical field but below upper critical field ) the superconductor allows magnetic flux to enter in quantized packets surrounded by a superconducting current vortex (see Quantum vortex). These sites of penetration are known as flux tubes. The number of flux tubes per unit area is proportional to the magnetic field with a constant of proportionality equal to the magnetic flux quantum. On a simple 76 millimeter diameter, 1-micrometer thick disk, next to a magnetic field of 28 kA/m, there are approximately 100 billion flux tubes that hold 70,000 times the superconductor&#x27;s weight. At lower temperatures the flux tubes are pinned in place and cannot move. This pinning is what holds the superconductor in place thereby allowing it to levitate. This phenomenon is closely related to the Meissner effect, though with one crucial difference — the Meissner effect shields the superconductor from all magnetic fields causing repulsion, unlike the pinned state of the superconductor disk which pins flux, and the superconductor in place.

==Importance==
Flux pinning is desirable in high-temperature ceramic superconductors to prevent &quot;flux creep&quot;, which can create a pseudo-resistance and depress both critical current density and critical field.

Degradation of a high-temperature superconductor&#x27;s properties due to flux creep is a limiting factor in the use of these superconductors. SQUID magnetometers suffer reduced precision in a certain range of applied field due to flux creep in the superconducting magnet used to bias the sample, and the maximum field strength of high-temperature superconducting magnets is drastically reduced by the depression in critical field.

=== Potential applications ===
The worth of flux pinning is seen through many implementations such as lifts, frictionless joints, and transportation. The thinner the superconducting layer, the stronger the pinning that occurs when exposed to magnetic fields. Since the superconductor is pinned above the magnet away from any surfaces, there is the potential for a frictionless joint. Transportation is another area in which flux pinning technology could revolutionize and reform. &quot;MagSurf&quot; was developed by the Paris Diderot University utilizing flux pinning to create a hoverboard-like effect that could transport a person, demonstrating the usefulness of the technology. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro has also been developing a flux pinning-based MagLev system called Maglev Cobra, which aims for a smaller form factor than existing urban rail systems. There has also been some research into using the flux pinning effect to isolate vibrations for microdevices. The ability to fix the superconductor in space can be used as a damping device like a spring. This idea has proposed for isolating vibrations for parts in satellites.

<text>The .45 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), also known as .45 Auto, .45 Automatic, or 11.43×23mm is a rimless straight-walled handgun cartridge designed by John Moses Browning in 1904, for use in his prototype Colt semi-automatic pistol. After successful military trials, it was adopted as the standard chambering for Colt&#x27;s M1911 pistol. The round was developed due to a lack of stopping power experienced in the Moro Rebellion in places like Sulu. The issued ammunition, .38 Long Colt, had proved inadequate, motivating the search for a better cartridge. This experience and the Thompson–LaGarde Tests of 1904 led the Army and the Cavalry to decide that a minimum of .45 caliber was required in a new handgun cartridge.

The standard-issue military .45 ACP cartridge uses a round-nose bullet at approximately fired from a government-issue M1911A1 pistol. It operates at a relatively low maximum chamber pressure rating of , compared to for both 9mm Parabellum and .40 S&amp;W, which due to a low bolt thrust helps extend the service lives of weapons. Since standard-pressure .45 ACP rounds are subsonic when fired from handguns and submachine guns, it is a useful caliber for suppressed weapons to eliminate the sonic boom.

==Design and history==

During the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, the United States Cavalry began trials to replace their sidearm arsenal of issued Single Action Army (SAA) in favor of the more modern and versatile double-action revolver in .45 Colt.

After the example of the Cavalry, the Army in turn had fielded versions of double-action revolvers in .38 Long Colt. It was eventually evaluated that the .38-caliber round was significantly less effective in overall stopping power than the .45 Colt against determined opponents in cases such as the Tausug Moro juramentado warriors, who were encountered in the Moro Rebellion. The standard-issue rifle, the .30-40 Krag, had also failed to stop Moro warriors effectively; the British had similar lack-of-stopping-power issues switching to the .303 British, which resulted in the development of the &quot;dum-dum&quot; bullet, in an attempt to compensate for the round&#x27;s deficiencies. This experience, and the Thompson–LaGarde Tests of 1904, led the Army and the Cavalry to decide a minimum of .45-caliber was required in a new handgun. Thompson and Major Louis La Garde of the medical corps arranged tests on cadavers and animals in the Chicago stockyards, resulting in their declaring that the .45 was the most effective pistol cartridge. They noted, however, training was critical to make sure a soldier could score a hit in a vulnerable part of the body.

Colt had been working with Browning on a .41 caliber cartridge in 1904, and in 1905, when the Cavalry asked for a .45-caliber equivalent, Colt modified the pistol design to fire an enlarged version of the prototype .41 round. The result from Colt was the Model 1905 and the new .45 ACP cartridge. The original round that passed the testing fired a bullet at , but after a number of rounds of revisions between Winchester Repeating Arms, Frankford Arsenal, and Union Metallic Cartridge, it ended up using a bullet fired at a nominal velocity of . The resulting .45 caliber cartridge, named the &quot;.45 ACP&quot;, was similar in performance to the .45 Schofield cartridge and only slightly less powerful while significantly shorter than the .45 Colt cartridge that the United States Cavalry was using at the time.

By 1906, bids from six makers were submitted, among them, Browning&#x27;s design, submitted by Colt. Only DWM, Savage, and Colt made the first cut. DWM, which submitted two Luger pistols chambered in .45 ACP, withdrew from testing after the first round of tests, for unspecified reasons.

During the second round of evaluations in 1910, the Colt design passed extensive testing with no failures, while the Savage design suffered 37 stoppages or parts failures. The Colt pistol was adopted as the Model 1911.

The cartridge-pistol combination was quite successful but not satisfactory for U.S. military purposes. Over time, a series of improved designs were offered, culminating in the adoption in 1911 of the &quot;Cal. 45 Automatic Pistol Ball Cartridge, Model of 1911&quot;, a round with a bullet weight of . The first production, at Frankford Arsenal, was marked &quot;F A 8 11&quot;, for the August 1911 date.

The cartridge was designed by John Browning for Colt, but the most influential person in selecting the cartridge was Army ordnance member General John T. Thompson. After the poor performance of the Army&#x27;s .38 Long Colt pistols evidenced during the Philippine–American War (1899–1902), Thompson insisted on a more capable pistol cartridge.

===Military cartridges===
====U.S. military====

The &quot;T&quot; (trials) designation was used for the experimental version of a cartridge and &quot;M&quot; (model) is used for the accepted and standardized version.
It came in either 24-round revolver ammo cartons, containing eight 3-round &quot;half-moon&quot; clips (1917-1945), pre-war 20-round cartons (1911-1942), or wartime 50-round cartons (1942–present). The M12 and M15 shotshell rounds were packed in 20-round cartons sealed in heat-sealed foil-lined Kraft paper. 
:&quot;Caliber .45 ball M1911&quot; was the standard full-metal jacketed lead-core bullet. 
:&quot;Caliber .45 dummy M1921&quot; has a hole drilled through the case and does not have a primer. 
:&quot;Caliber .45 blank M9&quot; has a tapered case and does not have a bullet.
:&quot;Caliber .45 shot M12(T23)&quot; (1943-1944 ) was a survival round with a round-nosed red wax paper projectile containing 118 pieces of No. 7 birdshot. It was issued in USAAF survival kits to allow pilots and aircrew armed with the Colt M1911A1 to use it for hunting small game. The shotshell was a little longer than a standard round, so the operator had to load it in the action individually. It was extracted after firing by removing the magazine, pulling back the slide, and pushing down on the case until it fell down the magazine well. Reports showed that the paper projectile was affected by humidity and would swell or break apart. It was made limited standard until replaced by the .45 M15 shot cartridge. 
:&quot;Caliber .45 shot M15&quot; was an improved survival round loaded with 108 pieces of No. 7 birdshot, with wadding and a vermilion cardboard disc sealing the casemouth. It was loaded and extracted exactly like the M12 shot cartridge. 
:&quot;Caliber .45 tracer M26 (T30)&quot; has a red tip. The round was designed as a short-ranged red flare for use in emergency signalling.

====Commonwealth military====
&quot;S.A.&quot; stands for small arms. The &quot;z&quot; in the designation stands for cartridges loaded with nitrocellulose rather than cordite.
:&quot;Cartridge, S.A., pistol, .45-inch Colt Automatic, ball&quot; (1917) was the British designation used for American-manufactured ammunition. The Royal Navy had purchased a shipment of M1911 pistols in 1917 along with enough ammunition for evaluation, training and service purposes. It was never standardized by the Lists of Changes, but was mentioned in the Vocabulary of Priced Stores. It came in seven-round packets and was manufactured by Winchester. 
:&quot;Cartridge, S.A., .45-inch, ball Mk Iz&quot; (1940–1945) was the designation used for American-manufactured ammunition and proposed British manufacture of .45 M1911 ball. Lend-lease ammunition came in commercial 42-round yellow Winchester or 50-round white Western Cartridge Company cartons. U.S. military-issue ammunition came in 20-round cartons, shifting to larger 50-round cartons in early 1942. It was never manufactured in Britain because it was readily available from American forces.
:&quot;Cartridge, S.A., .45-inch, ball Mk IIz&quot; (1943) was a variant proposed for the Royal Navy, but never put into production. 
:&quot;Cartridge, S.A., .45-inch A. C., ball&quot; (1942–1946) was the Canadian designation for their domestically manufactured ammunition for use in the European theater. It came in a plain 42-round carton that mimicked the capacity and dimensions of the yellow commercial Winchester ammunition cartons sold to Britain through Lend-lease.
:&quot;Cartridge, S.A., .450-inch, ball Mk IIz&quot; (1943–1956) was the Australian designation used for their domestically-manufactured ammunition for use in the Pacific theater. It came in 24-round cartons.

====French Union military====
:&quot;Cartouche de 11,43 mm, Pour Pistolets&quot; (&#x27;11.43 mm cartridge for pistols&#x27;): &quot;Balle ordinaire&quot; (&#x27;ordinary ball&#x27;) pistol ammunition. Post-war production for use in the pistols and submachine guns given out by the US as military aid. It came in 25-round cartons.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .45 ACP has of cartridge case capacity, depending on manufacturer and production lot.

45 Auto maximum CIP cartridge dimensions. All sizes are in millimeters (mm).

SAAMI specifications for 45 Automatic. All dimensions are in inches (millimeters)

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 1 in , 6 grooves, Ø lands = .442 in (11.23 mm), Ø grooves = 45 in (11.43 mm), land width = .147 in (3.73 mm) and the primer type is large pistol.
The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case at the L3 datum reference.

According to Commission internationale permanente pour l&#x27;épreuve des armes à feu portatives (CIP) rulings, the .45 ACP cartridge case can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In CIP-regulated countries every pistol cartridge combination has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that .45 ACP chambered arms in CIP-regulated countries are currently (2016) proof-tested at PE piezo pressure.

The SAAMI pressure limit for the .45 ACP is set at piezo pressure, while the SAAMI pressure limit for the .45 ACP +P is set at , piezo pressure.

==Performance==
The .45 ACP is an effective combat pistol cartridge. It combines accuracy as well as stopping power for use against human targets, has relatively low muzzle blast and flash, and it produces moderate recoil in handguns (made worse in compact models or with hot loads).
The .45 ACP is generally considered to have greater stopping power than the 9mm. Due to its larger size and slower velocity it creates a larger wound channel and transfers more energy to the target.

The standard-issue, military .45 ACP cartridge contains a bullet that travels at approximately when fired from the government-issue M1911A1 pistol, and approximately fired from the Thompson M1A1 submachine gun. The cartridge comes in various specialty rounds of varying weights and performance levels as well.

The cartridge operates at a relatively low maximum chamber pressure rating of (compared to for 9mm Parabellum and .40 S&amp;W, for 10mm Auto, for .357 SIG), which due to a low bolt thrust helps extend service life of weapons in which it is used. Some makers of pistols chambered in .45 ACP, do not certify them to use +P ammunition.

In its non-expanding full metal jacket (FMJ) version, the .45 ACP cartridge has a reputation for effectiveness against human targets because of its heavy mass, having the capacity to penetrate tissue deeply, and damage the central nervous system. Its large 11.5 mm diameter creates a more substantial permanent wound channel versus smaller calibers, which can lower blood pressure rapidly if critical organs of the circulatory system are hit.

In its expanding hollow point form, it is also particularly effective against human targets. In tests against ballistic gelatin, a hollow point traveling at expanded to about . This is a significantly large permanent wound cavity for a handgun projectile. For those who follow the energy dump and/or hydrostatic shock theories of wounding ballistics, this is ideal. While slightly decreasing penetration and likewise the chance of hitting a vital organ, a large diameter wound will cause more blood loss. There is also a reduced likelihood of overpenetration, meaning that it is more likely that the projectile will transfer all of its kinetic energy to the intended target, thus more reliably incapacitating them.

Drawbacks for military use include the cartridge&#x27;s large size, weight, and increased material costs in comparison to the smaller, flatter shooting NATO standard 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, a cartridge which uses less powder, brass, and lead per round. Standard 9mm NATO ammunition has a more limited armor penetration capability—a deficiency shared with .45 ACP, whose large, slow bullet does not penetrate armor to any great extent. The low muzzle velocity also makes the bullet drop more over long ranges, making hits more difficult; however, it is important to note that the vast majority of self-defense situations involving handguns typically occur at close ranges.

After two years of testing, one of the final FBI comments was that services that adopt (or stay with) .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP, did so at the risk of increased recoil and a possible reduction in accuracy as 9×19mm with premium quality ammunition had nearly exactly the same performance. A factor rated by the recent FBI testing was accuracy and time to recover. The .45 ACP handguns ranked last, largely due to increased recoil.

===Use in suppressors===
As standard pressure .45 ACP rounds fired from handguns and submachine guns are inherently subsonic, it is one of the most powerful pistol calibers available for use in suppressed weapons since subsonic rounds are quieter than supersonic rounds. The latter inevitably produce a highly compressed shock wave, audible as a loud &quot;crack&quot;, a small sonic boom, while they travel through the air. Suppressors reduce the audible &quot;report&quot; by slowing and channeling the high speed gas generated by the burning/expanding gunpowder before it exits the muzzle resulting in a muffled &quot;cough&quot;. Suppressors cannot act on a supersonic shock wave continuously generated by a bullet exceeding the speed of sound at ambient cold temperatures, as this shock wave is continuously produced throughout the entire flight path over which the bullet is supersonic, which extends long after it exits the barrel.

The downside to the use of .45 ACP in suppressed weapons is that increasing the diameter of the passage through a suppressor decreases the suppressor&#x27;s efficiency; thus, while .45 ACP is among the most powerful suppressed pistol rounds, it is also one of the loudest. Most .45 ACP suppressors must be fired &quot;wet&quot; (with an ablative medium, usually oil or water) to bring sound levels down to &quot;hearing-safe&quot; (under 140 dB, generally).

==Magazine capacities==
Magazine capacity varies depending on the type of firearm. Standard (not extended) single-stack magazines for pistols based on the 1911 design commonly, hold eight rounds or fewer in .45 ACP. Many modern pistols, such as the Glock 21, have adapted the cartridge into double-stacked magazine designs to increase ammo capacity, though this increases the pistol grip&#x27;s girth. Drum magazines used mostly for submachine guns have a capacity of 50 or 100 rounds.

==Adoption==

Several US tactical police units still use the .45 pistol round. While high capacity firearms are available in .45 ACP, the greater length and diameter of the .45 ACP means that the grip of the pistol must be longer and wider than the grip of a comparable pistol of a smaller caliber, such as 9×19mm Parabellum; this increase in grip size can make the pistol difficult to use for shooters with smaller hands.

Today, most NATO militaries use sidearms chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge, but the effectiveness of the .45 ACP cartridge has ensured its continued popularity with large-caliber sport shooters, especially in the United States. In addition, select military and police units around the world still use firearms firing the .45 ACP. In 1985, the .45 ACP M1911A1 pistol was replaced by the Beretta M9 9mm pistol as the main sidearm of the U.S. military, although select Special Operations units continue to use the M1911A1 or other .45 ACP pistols.

==Load variants==
Rounds are available from with a common load being the standard military loading of a FMJ bullet (for comparison, the most common 9mm load is , half the weight). Specialty rounds are available in weights under and over ; popular rounds among reloaders and target shooters include bullets. Target shooters competing in Bullseye Pistol (aka Precision Pistol) find that .45 ACP ammunition using light bullets (12 to 13 g) and low velocities paradoxically generates less recoil than 9mm ammunition of equivalent accuracy, despite its larger caliber, and allows better scores in sustained fire. Hollow-point rounds intended for maximum effectiveness against live targets are designed to expand upon impact with soft tissue, increasing the size of the permanent cavity left by the bullet as it passes through the target.

Tracer ammunition for the .45 ACP was manufactured by Frankford Arsenal and by Remington Arms. This ammunition was available to the United States Border Patrol as early as 1940 and was used through World War II for emergency signalling by downed United States Navy and Marine Corps air crew. Tracer ammunition was identified by painting the bullet tip red.

=== Plus P ===
Most ammunition manufacturers also market what are termed &quot;+P&quot; (pronounced &quot;plus P&quot;, designating overpressure ammunition) loadings in pistol ammunition, including the .45 ACP. This means the cartridge is loaded to a higher maximum pressure level than the original SAAMI cartridge standard, generating higher velocity and more muzzle energy. In the case of the .45 ACP, the new standard cartridge pressure is and the SAAMI .45 ACP +P standard is . This is a common practice for updating older cartridges to match the better quality of materials and workmanship in modern firearms.

The terminology is generally given as &quot;45 ACP +P&quot; and sometimes, but not always, appears on the headstamp. These cartridges have the same external dimensions as the standard-pressure cartridges and will chamber and fire in all firearms designed for the standard-pressure loadings. The inner dimensions of the +P cartridge are different from the standard-pressure cartridge dimensions and thus allows for higher pressures to be safely achieved in the +P cartridge. If +P loadings are used in firearms not specifically designed for them, they may cause damage to the weapon and injuries to the operator.

===Others===
Popular derivative versions of the .45 ACP are .45 Super and .460 Rowland. The Super is dimensionally identical to the .45 ACP; however, the cartridge carries a developer established pressure of and requires minor modification of firearms for use. The Rowland operates at a developer established SAAMI and may only be used within a select group of firearms significantly modified for this purpose; the Rowland case is longer specifically to prevent it from being chambered in standard .45 ACP firearms. Brass cases for each of these cartridges carry the applicable name within the headstamp. The Super provides approximately 20% greater velocity than the .45 ACP +P; the Rowland approximately 40% greater velocity than the .45 ACP +P.

<text>The .380 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), also known as .380 Auto, .380 Automatic, or 9×17mm, is a rimless, straight-walled pistol cartridge that was developed by firearms designer John Moses Browning. The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case. It was introduced in 1908 by Colt, for use in its new Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless semi-automatic, and has been a popular self-defense cartridge ever since, seeing wide use in numerous handguns (typically smaller weapons). Other names for .380 ACP include 9mm Browning, 9mm Corto, 9mm Kurz, 9mm Short, and 9mm Browning Court (which is the C.I.P. designation). It should not be confused with .38 ACP. The .380 ACP does not strictly conform to cartridge naming conventions, named after the diameter of the bullet, as the actual bullet diameter of the .380 ACP is .355 inches.

==Design==
The .380 ACP cartridge was derived from Browning&#x27;s earlier .38 ACP design, which was only marginally more powerful. The .380 ACP was designed to be truly rimless, and headspaces on the case mouth instead of the rim for better accuracy. These relatively low-powered designs were intended for blowback pistols which lacked a barrel locking mechanism, which is often required for any handgun firing a round more powerful than a .380 ACP. Using blowback operation, the design can be simplified, and lowered in cost; a locking mechanism is unnecessary, since the mass of the slide and strength of the recoil spring are enough to absorb the recoil energy of the round, due to the round&#x27;s relatively low bolt thrust. Blowback operation also permits the barrel to be permanently fixed to the frame, which promotes accuracy, unlike a traditional short recoil-operation pistol, which requires a tilting barrel to unlock the slide and barrel assembly when cycling. A drawback of the blowback system is that it requires a certain amount of slide mass to counter the recoil of the round used. The higher the power of the round, the heavier the slide assembly has to be in order for its inertia to safely absorb the recoil, meaning that a typical blowback pistol in a given caliber will be heavier than an equivalent recoil-operated weapon. Blowback weapons can be made in calibers larger than .380 ACP, but the required weight of the slide and strength of the spring makes this an unpopular option.

Although the low power of the .380 ACP does not require a locking mechanism, there have been a number of locked-breech pistols chambered in .380 ACP, such as the Remington Model 51, Kel-Tec P3AT and Glock 42; all three being designed to be lighter than blowback-operated .380 ACP weapons. There have also been some relatively diminutive (blowback-operated) submachine guns, such as the Ingram MAC-11 and the Czech CZ 83.

==Users==
The .380 ACP has experienced widespread usage since its introduction in the United States (1908) and in Europe (1912). It was later adopted by the armies of at least five European nations as their standard pistol cartridge before World War II; Czechoslovakia (Vz.38), Hungary (FEMARU 37M), and Italy, all of whom used domestic designs, as well as The Netherlands and Yugoslavia, both of whom adopted the FN Model 1922. It was also used extensively by Germany, who captured or purchased hundreds of thousands of pistols in this caliber during World War II. Popular German built commercial models, such as the Walther PPK were very popular with German officers. The Italian Army used the Beretta M1934, but the Italian Air Force and Navy stuck with the 7.65mm/.32 ACP when they adopted the Beretta M1935.

While the .380 ACP was considered to be a moderately powerful service pistol round before World War II when compared to the .32 ACP pistols it replaced, few nations retained it as a military service cartridge for very long after the war (it was eventually replaced by the more powerful 9×19mm Parabellum after NATO standardization in the 1960s). It was widely used by police forces in Europe until the 1970s, when more powerful 9×19mm handguns began to replace it in this market. It does find some use as a backup gun due to the generally small and easily concealable size of the weapons that chambered it (very few &quot;mini pistols&quot; are made in calibers larger than .380 ACP, and those few are recent developments), and is popular on the civilian market as a personal defense round. The .380 ACP round is suitable for self-defense situations as a choice for concealed carry pistols. It was the round used in Defense Distributed&#x27;s &quot;Wiki Weapon&quot; project to successfully 3D print a firearm.

==Performance==

The .380 ACP is compact and light, but has a shorter range and less stopping power than other modern pistol cartridges, depending on the load of the cartridge and manufacturer. .380 ACP remains a popular self-defense cartridge for shooters who want a lightweight or smaller pistol with manageable recoil. It is slightly less powerful than a standard-pressure .38 Special, but also uses 9 mm (.355 in) diameter bullets. The standard bullet weights are generally , , , , , , and .

The wounding potential of a bullet is often characterized in terms of its expanded diameter, penetration depth, and energy. Bullet energies for .380 ACP loads vary from . The table below shows common performance parameters for several .380 ACP loads. Bullet weights ranging from are the most common. Penetration depths from are available for various applications and risk assessments.

<text>The BFG (&quot;Big Fucking Gun&quot;) is a fictional weapon found in many video games, mostly in id Software-developed series&#x27; such as &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;.

The abbreviation BFG stands for &quot;Big Fucking Gun&quot; as described in Tom Hall&#x27;s original &quot;Doom&quot; design document and in the user manual of &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;. The &quot;Quake II&quot; manual says it stands for &quot;Big, Uh, Freakin&#x27; Gun&quot;. This euphemistic label implies the more profane name of the BFG. Another version of the name used in the &quot;Doom&quot; motion picture is &quot;Bio Force Gun&quot;. The versions found in the &quot;Doom&quot; games are called &quot;BFG 9000&quot; and those in &quot;Quake&quot; &quot;BFG 10K&quot;.

==Appearances==

===&quot;Doom&quot;===
The weapon first appeared in the press beta release of &quot;Doom&quot;. In that version, the BFG9000 released a cloud of 80 small plasma balls (randomly green or red) per shot, which could bounce off floors and ceilings. However, it was scrapped as developer John Romero stated that it &quot;looked like Christmas&quot; and severely slowed the game down due to the large number of on-screen sprites.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the BFG9000 in the first commercial &quot;Doom&quot; game as &quot;the Ultimate Weapon&quot;. It is a large energy weapon that fires giant balls of green plasma as well as 40 invisible rays in a cone shape. The most powerful weapon in the game, it causes major damage to most types of enemies and can clear an entire room of foes in one shot, or deal huge damage to singular enemies. In the first &quot;Doom&quot;, the weapon can only be picked up in the third and fourth episodes. The BFG 9000 also appears virtually unchanged in &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot;, &quot;Final Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom 64&quot;, and &quot;Doom RPG&quot;.

===Other versions===
In &quot;Doom 3&quot;, the BFG 9000 is a charged weapon: holding down the trigger causes the weapon to accumulate energy before release, resulting in a more powerful shot. Overcharging the BFG will cause it to overheat and explode, killing the player instantly.

&quot;Quake II&quot; and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; pay homage to the BFG9000 with a pair of weapons both called the BFG10K. The &quot;Quake II&quot; version fires a slow plasma ball that fires rays at any enemies in range and line-of-sight. The &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; version of the BFG fire a series of fast plasma orbs, and acts quite like the rocket launcher (rocket jumping can also be done with the BFG10K). The BFG10K from &quot;Quake III&quot; also appears in &quot;OpenArena&quot; (with a different appearance) and &quot;Quake Live&quot; (with slightly modified characteristics). &quot;Rage&quot; also pays homage to the BFG9000 with a weapon known as the &quot;Authority Pulse Cannon&quot;, that fires &quot;BFG Rounds&quot;.

In the &quot;Doom&quot; movie, the &quot;bio force gun&quot; fires a bright blue projectile that appears to burst on impact and spray a caustic substance over its target and the surrounding area.

The BFG is featured in Doom&#x27;s 2016 reboot, but unlike in its first two appearances, it follows the mechanics of its &quot;Quake II&quot; rendition, firing a projectile that shoots beams at enemies. The game itself does not resolve the acronym &quot;BFG&quot; either in-game or in its codex entries, although one challenge in the game&#x27;s final campaign level involving the BFG is called &quot;Big [REDACTED] Gun&quot; as a nod to the original vulgar name. In that game&#x27;s pinball adaptation, it is called the &quot;Big Fancy Gun&quot;, and is the most powerful weapon that the Doom Slayer can obtain; collecting it will grant the player an extra ball. 

In 2020&#x27;s &quot;Doom Eternal&quot;, a new version of the weapon, the BFG 10000, appears, as a massive interplanetary particle-beam weapon mounted on Mars&#x27; moon, Phobos, used by the in-universe organization, the UAC, to protect its control of Mars and the surrounding space. The BFG 9000 also returns as the main component of the BFG 10000, and, after the BFG 10000 is commandeered by the Doom Slayer to shoot a hole into the surface of Mars, he removes the 9000 from its socket and carries it around as a usable weapon, where it is functionally identical to the 2016 version.

== Mechanics ==

=== &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot; and &quot;Final Doom&quot; ===
The BFG&#x27;s internal game mechanics are two-fold. When the trigger is pulled, there is a pause of 30 game tics (≈0.857 seconds) before a large, relatively slow moving green and white plasma projectile is ejected. The actual projectile deals a significant amount of damage (between 100 and 800 hit points of damage, in multiples of 100), but the majority of the damage is dealt 16 game tics (≈0.457 seconds) after the direct hit in a 45-degree (90 degree wide) cone originating from the player who fired the shot, via 40 invisible tracers, causing each tracer to deal random damage of between 15 and 120 hit points of damage (but is limited to between 49 and 87 hit points of damage due to the pseudo-random number generator that &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II: Hell on Earth&quot; and &quot;Final Doom&quot; uses) on a solid object within 1,024 map units. 

Standing closer to the target causes them to absorb more tracers. The direction of the cone corresponds to the original shot, but it radiates from the player&#x27;s current location at the time of the main projectile&#x27;s impact. The player can move, even into a different room, and deal damage there, given enough time before the projectile&#x27;s impact.

==Appearances and homages outside &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;==
The BFG also makes an appearance in Avalanche Studios&#x27; &quot;Rage 2&quot;.
BFG cells are in 2011&#x27;s RAGE.
A similar weapon makes an appearance in MachineGames&#x27; &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot;. According to the game&#x27;s plot, the weapon, named &quot;Übergewehr&quot; (&quot;Super-rifle&quot; in German), was developed by the Nazis in the 1960s. It utilizes a mixture of laser and diesel energy, as well as a mysterious third source of energy, described as “extra-dimensional microportals&quot;, possibly hinting that it is the same Argent Energy mentioned in Doom (2016) onwards. The behaviour of the weapon is similar to Doom 3&#x27;s BFG: it can be charged in order to release a sphere of energy strong enough to vaporize a horde of soldiers.

Epic MegaGames&#x27; &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; named the gun of the protagonist as LFG-2000 (Laser Flash Gun 2000)

The fusion research company First Light commissioned Physics Applications Inc. to build a high velocity projectile fusion research tool, which is named “The Big Friendly Gun”, and refer to this as the “BFG”.

The BFG also makes an appearance in Chucklefish&#x27;s game Starbound. While it goes by the name &quot;Doomcannon&quot;, it uses a near identical sprite to the first appearance of the BFG in the Doom games. The Doomcannon also uses 40 energy per shot, just like the original BFG.

===BFR===

&quot;BFR&quot; was the codename for SpaceX&#x27;s privately funded launch vehicle announced by Elon Musk in September 2017. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell has stated that BFR stands for &quot;Big Falcon Rocket&quot;. However, Elon Musk has explained that although BFR was the code name, he drew inspiration from the BFG weapon in the &quot;Doom&quot; video games. The BFR had been referred to informally by the media and internally at SpaceX as &quot;Big Fucking Rocket&quot;. The upper stage was called Big Falcon Ship (unofficially &quot;Big Fucking Ship&quot;). The BFR was eventually officially renamed to &quot;Starship&quot;.

==Reception==
UGO.com ranked the BFG 9000 at number two on their list of top video game weapons of all time, stating &quot;it was marvellous and complex, and we should not hesitate to put this weapon down in history as one of the best.&quot; &quot;X-Play&quot; ranked it number one on their list of top &quot;badass&quot; weapons, stating that while &quot;not as fancy as the Gravity Gun&quot;, it was the first weapon that &quot;really made us swoon&quot;. IGN also listed the BFG as one of the hundred best weapons in video games, placing it at number two, saying that &quot;The BFG established exactly what we should expect when it comes to powerful in-game weaponry&quot;. Machinima.com named it number one on their list of top video game weapons, stating &quot;Do you really need a reason why this tops the list?&quot;

<text>A Bachelor of Engineering (BE or BEng) or Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BSE) is an undergraduate academic degree awarded to a college graduate majoring in an engineering discipline at a higher education institution.

In the United Kingdom, a Bachelor of Engineering degree program is accredited by one of the Engineering Council&#x27;s professional engineering institutions as suitable for registration as an incorporated engineer or chartered engineer with further study to masters level. In Canada, a degree from a Canadian university can be accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB). Alternatively, it might be accredited directly by another professional engineering institution, such as the US-based Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Bachelor of Engineering contributes to the route to chartered engineer (UK), registered engineer or licensed professional engineer and has been approved by representatives of the profession. Similarly Bachelor of Engineering (BE) and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in India is accredited by All India Council for Technical Education. Most universities in the United States and Europe award bachelor&#x27;s degrees in engineering through various names.

A less common and possibly the oldest variety of the degree in the English-speaking world is &quot;Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria&quot; (B.A.I.), a Latin name meaning &quot;Bachelor in the Art of Engineering&quot;. Here &quot;Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria&quot; implies excellence in carrying out the &#x27;art&#x27; or &#x27;function&#x27; of an engineer. Some South African universities refer to their engineering degrees as B.Ing. (&quot;&quot;, in Afrikaans).

== Engineering fields ==
A Bachelor of Engineering degree will usually be undertaken in one field of engineering, which is sometimes noted in the degree postnominals, as in &quot;B.E.&quot;, &quot;B.AE. (Aero)&quot;, or &quot;B.Eng (Elec)&quot;. Common fields for the Bachelor of Engineering degree include the following fields:
* Aerospace Engineering
* Agricultural Engineering
* Architectural Engineering
* Automotive Engineering
* Biological Engineering — including Biochemical, Biomedical, Biosystems and Biomolecular
* Chemical Engineering — deals with the process of converting raw materials or chemicals into more useful or valuable forms
* Clean Technology — use energy, water and raw materials and other inputs more efficiently and productively. Create less waste or toxicity and deliver equal or superior performance.
* Computer Engineering

==International variations==

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the &quot;Bachelor of Engineering&quot; (BE or BEng - depending on the institution) is a four-year undergraduate degree course and a professional qualification.

The title of “engineer” is not protected in Australia, therefore anyone can claim to be an engineer and practice without the necessary competencies, understanding of standards or in compliance with a code of ethics. The industry has attempted to overcome the lack of title protection through chartership (CPEng), national registration (NER) and various state registration (RPEQ) programs which are usually obtained after a few years of professional practice.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, degrees awarded for undergraduate engineering studies include the &quot;Bachelor of Engineering&quot; (B.Eng. or B.E., depending on the institution); the &quot;&quot; (B.Ing., the French equivalent of a B.Eng.; sometimes referred to as a ); the &quot;Bachelor of Applied Science&quot; (B.A.Sc.); and the &quot;Bachelor of Science in Engineering&quot; (B.Sc.Eng.).

The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB), a division of the Engineers Canada, sets out and maintains the standards of accreditation among Canadian undergraduate engineering programs. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada. This practice is intended to maintain standards of education and allow mobility of engineers in different provinces of Canada.

A CEAB-accredited degree is the minimum academic requirement for registration as a professional engineer anywhere in the country and the standard against which all other engineering academic qualifications are measured. Graduation from an accredited program, which normally involves four years of study, is a required first step to becoming a professional engineer. Regulation and accreditation are accomplished through a self-governing body (the name of which varies from province to province), which is given the power by statute to register and discipline engineers, as well as regulate the field of engineering in the individual provinces.

Graduates of non-CEAB-accredited programs must demonstrate that their education is at least equivalent to that of a graduate of a CEAB-accredited program.

=== Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng) is a five year undergraduate professional degree course.

The title of &quot;Engineer&quot; or &quot;Engr&quot; is protected in Nigeria, making it impossible for any one to be addressed officially as one, if not a certified engineer.

Certification comes with registration and accreditation by Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN). It is the regulatory body that governs the practice of engineering in Nigeria.

The membership is required to practice engineering independently. It is a requirement for some engineering firms and is mandatory for government contracts.

<text>Etoy is a European digital art group formed in 1994. It has won several international awards including the Prix Ars Electronica in 1996. Their main slogan is: &quot;leaving reality behind.&quot;

Etoy has routinely experimented with the boundaries of art, such as selling shares of &quot;stock&quot; in the etoy.corporation, a registered company in Switzerland and travelling the world as well as living in &quot;etoy.tanks&quot; (cargo containers).

==History==
etoy was founded in 1994 by Gino Esposto (etoy.ESPOSTO/CARL), Michel Zai (etoy.ZAI), Daniel Udatny (etoy.UDATNY), Martin Kubli (etoy.KUBLI), Marky Goldstein (etoy.GOLDSTEIN), Fabio Gramazio (etoy.GRAMAZIO) and Hans Bernhard (etoy.BRAINHARD/HANS). 

The group first used the name &quot;etoy&quot; in 1994, for performances at raves and techno music events. The group&#x27;s members, based in various European countries, were referred to as &quot;agents&quot;.

etoy reached worldwide fame in 1996 with the digital hijack. In the same year, etoy won the Prix Ars Electronica. The group&#x27;s work includes numerous digital performances.

Following internal conflicts, only Gramazio, Zai and Kubli were left of the founding members in 1998 after several resignations. New agents supported etoy in 1999/2000 in the battle against the online toy retailer eToys for the internet domain “etoy.com” and American trademark rights, which became known as toywar. 

Since 2005, etoy.CORPORATION has been working on Mission Eternity. 
In 2007, German and Swiss director Andrea Reiter realised a documentary (produced by Hugofilm) about etoy&#x27;s &quot;Mission Eternity&quot; project, a &quot;digital cult of the dead&quot;. This art project dealt with topics such as death and immortalization. She and her team followed the etoy.CREW and their Mission Eternity sarcophagus to Berlin, Zurich, San Jose and Nevada. The Hugofilm production was released in early 2008. 

As of 2015, a history overview on the group&#x27;s website describes it as entering &quot;hibernation mode&quot; in 2013.

Over one hundred etoy shares are owned by art collectors, museums and others. Each certificate documents an (ownership) share in the overall work and at the same time visually represents an important moment in the company or art history.

==Toywar==

The &quot;toywar&quot; was a legal battle around 1999/2000 between the Internet toy retailer eToys.com and etoy about the domain name etoy.com. Fearing brand dilution and customer confusion about the similar domain names, eToys sued etoy for trademark infringement, and asked etoy to remove graphic images and profane language from their website that were bringing customer complaints. The artists refused to comply, and eToys eventually obtained a preliminary injunction against etoy which shut down their website. etoy fought back with a coordinated public relations campaign and Internet-based denial of service attacks on eToys.com. After several weeks eToys dropped the lawsuit and the etoy website returned to operation.

etoy activists have called it &quot;the most expensive performance in art history&quot;. The story is one of the subjects of the documentary film, &quot;info wars&quot;.

An email campaign was led by Internet activists including etoy agents developing the toywar website.

A book about the story of the etoy corporation, &quot;Leaving reality behind&quot;, by Regula Bochsler and Adam Wishart was released in 2002.

<doc id="530918" wikidata="Q158801" url="?curid=530918" title=".45 GAP">
<text>The .45 GAP (Glock Auto Pistol) or .45 Glock (11.43×19mmRB) is a pistol cartridge designed by Ernest Durham, an engineer with CCI/Speer, at the request of firearms manufacturer Glock to provide a cartridge that would equal the power of the .45 ACP, have a stronger case head to reduce the possibility of case neck blowouts, and be shorter to fit in a more compact handgun. The .45 GAP is the first commercially introduced cartridge that has been identified with Glock.

==Development==
The .45 GAP has the same diameter as the .45 ACP pistol cartridge but is slightly shorter, and uses a small-pistol primer instead of the large-pistol primer most commonly used in .45 ACP ammunition. Originally, the maximum bullet weight of the .45 GAP was . In order to provide terminal ballistics that matched the standard .45 ACP loads, the .45 GAP was designed to operate at a higher standard pressure—roughly equivalent to the higher pressures found in .45 ACP &quot;+P&quot; rounds. Since the .45 GAP has a much smaller cartridge volume than the .45 ACP, the desired pressure and resulting velocity needed to be achieved through powder selection alone. Later development concluded that the .45 GAP can also fire projectiles, as does the .45 ACP; though this pushes the .45 GAP cartridge to its limits.

===Glock .45 GAP pistols===
The full-size Glock 37 pistol was introduced by Glock to use the .45 GAP cartridge and was followed by the compact Glock 38 and the subcompact Glock 39. Glock&#x27;s .45 GAP–sized pistols use the same frame as their 9×19mm/.40 S&amp;W/.357 SIG line of pistols. The slide is slightly wider to accommodate the larger diameter .45 round and is flush with the frame. Magazines for the .45 GAP are of the same dimensions as those of the 9×19mm/.40 S&amp;W/.357 SIG line of pistols.

===Other .45 GAP firearms===
Initially, due to its acceptance by law enforcement and the popularity of subcompact handguns for concealed carry, a small number of manufacturers decided to produce pistols that were chambered in .45 GAP, but they no longer produce any pistols in that caliber. Only Glock continues to manufacture pistols in the .45 GAP cartridge. Springfield Armory, Inc. did make the XD series in .45 GAP, and indeed it was the first commercially available pistol for it, but discontinued that chambering soon thereafter.

==Law enforcement applications==
Modern law enforcement as a whole has moved away from .45 caliber weapons in favor of firearms chambered in .40 S&amp;W and 9×19mm. Despite this change, the .45 GAP has had a following amongst many law enforcement departments. Three state law enforcement agencies have adopted the .45 GAP as a replacement for their current issue 9×19mm Parabellum (New York) or .40 S&amp;W service handguns (South Carolina and Florida). The New York State Police (New York Police have recently completed the transition to .45 ACP for their duty round), South Carolina Highway Patrol, and Florida Highway Patrol have all adopted the Glock 37 and .45 GAP.

The Pennsylvania State Police also carried the Glock 37 from 2007, but, due to ammunition supply problems, replaced them in 2013 with the fourth generation Glock 21 in .45 ACP. After recall issues with the new fourth generation Glocks, the Pennsylvania State Police switched to the SIG Sauer P227 in .45 ACP.

<doc id="530921" wikidata="Q1001051" url="?curid=530921" title="Buddhist texts">
<text>Buddhist texts are religious texts that belong to, or are associated with, Buddhism and its traditions. There is no single textual collection for all of Buddhism. Instead, there are three main Buddhist Canons: the Pāli Canon of the Theravāda tradition, the Chinese Buddhist Canon used in East Asian Buddhist tradition, and the Tibetan Buddhist Canon used in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. 

The earliest Buddhist texts were not committed to writing until some centuries after the death of Gautama Buddha. The oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts are the Gandhāran Buddhist texts, found in Pakistan and written in Gāndhārī, they date from the first century BCE to the third century CE. The first Buddhist texts were initially passed on orally by Buddhist monastics, but were later written down and composed as manuscripts in various Indo-Aryan languages (such as Pāli, Gāndhārī, and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit). These texts were collected into various collections and translated into other languages such as Buddhist Chinese (&quot;fójiào hànyǔ&quot; 佛教漢語) and Classical Tibetan as Buddhism spread outside of India.

Buddhist texts can be categorized in a number of ways. The Western terms &quot;scripture&quot; and &quot;canonical&quot; are applied to Buddhism in inconsistent ways by Western scholars: for example, one authority refers to &quot;scriptures and other canonical texts&quot;, while another says that scriptures can be categorized into canonical, commentarial, and pseudo-canonical. Buddhist traditions have generally divided these texts with their own categories and divisions, such as that between &quot;buddhavacana&quot; &quot;word of the Buddha,&quot; many of which are known as &quot;sutras&quot;, and other texts, such as &quot;shastras&quot; (treatises) or &quot;Abhidharma&quot;.

These religious texts were written in different languages, methods and writing systems. Memorizing, reciting and copying the texts was seen as spiritually valuable. Even after the development and adoption of printing by Buddhist institutions, Buddhists continued to copy them by hand as a spiritual exercise, a practice known as sutra copying. 

In an effort to preserve these scriptures, Asian Buddhist institutions were at the forefront of the adoption of Chinese technologies related to bookmaking, including paper, and block printing which were often deployed on a large scale. Because of this, the first surviving example of a printed text is a Buddhist charm, the first full printed book is the Buddhist &quot;Diamond Sutra&quot; (c. 868) and the first hand colored print is an illustration of Guanyin dated to 947.

==Buddhavacana==
The concept of &quot;buddhavacana&quot; (word of the Buddha) is important in understanding how Buddhists classify and see their texts. Buddhavacana texts have special status as sacred scripture and are generally seen as in accord with the teachings of the historical Buddha, which is termed &quot;the Dharma&quot;. According to Donald Lopez, the criteria for determining what should be considered buddhavacana were developed at an early stage, and that the early formulations do not suggest that Dharma is limited to what was spoken by the historical Buddha. Another term for &quot;buddha word&quot; is the “dispensation of the Buddha” (buddhānuśāsanam).

The Mahāsāṃghika and the Mūlasarvāstivāda considered both the Buddha&#x27;s discourses and those of his disciples to be &quot;buddhavacana&quot;. A number of different beings such as Buddhas, disciples of the Buddha, ṛṣis, and devas were considered capable of transmitting buddhavacana. According to early Buddhist sources like the &quot;Mahāpadesasutta&quot;, a text said by someone other than the Buddha may be certified as true buddhavacana by four &quot;great references to authority&quot; (mahāpadeśa): (1) the buddha himself (who often certified the statements of others as buddhavacana in the sutras), (2) a sangha of wise elders, (3) a small group of specialist monks (dharmadharas or vinayadharas), or (4) one elder knowledgeable in the Dharma. The content of such a discourse was then to be collated with the sūtras, compared with the Vinaya, and evaluated against the nature of the Dharma. This allowed a certain flexibility in the compilation of the Buddhist canons, which were not necessarily closed after the Buddha&#x27;s death. 

In Theravāda Buddhism, the standard collection of &quot;buddhavacana&quot; is the Pāli Canon, also known as the &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot; (&quot;three baskets&quot;). Generally speaking, the Theravāda school rejects the Mahāyāna sūtras as &quot;buddhavacana&quot; (word of the Buddha), and do not study or see these texts as reliable sources. In East Asian Buddhism, what is considered &quot;buddhavacana&quot; is collected in the Chinese Buddhist canon; the most common edition of this is the Taishō Tripiṭaka, itself based on the Tripiṭaka Koreana. This collection, unlike the Pāli &quot;Tripiṭaka&quot;, contains Mahāyāna sūtras, Śāstras (scholastic treatises), and Esoteric Buddhist literature.

Mahāyāna Buddhist sources generally tended to be more liberal in their interpretation of buddhavacana, allowing for more texts to be included (especially the Mahāyāna sūtras). As such, Mahayana sources often see buddhavacana as referring to statements which are well spoken and thus reflect the truth of the Dharma. For example, the &quot;Adhyāśayasañcodanasūtra&quot; states: “All which is well-spoken, Maitreya, is spoken by the Buddha.” According to the sūtra, “well spoken” (subhāsita) means that inspired speech should be seen as buddhavacana if it is in accord with four principles: 

* being meaningful and not meaningless,
* being principled and not unprincipled, 
* bringing about the extinction of the defilements and not their increase,
* it explains the qualities and benefits of nirvana, not the qualities and benefits of samsara.

According to Hsuan Hua from the tradition of Chinese Buddhism, there are five types of beings who may speak the sutras of Buddhism: a Buddha, a disciple of a Buddha, a deva, a ṛṣi, or an emanation of one of these beings; however, they must first receive certification from a buddha that its contents are true Dharma. Then these sutras may be properly regarded as &quot;buddhavacana&quot;. Sometimes texts that are considered commentaries by some are regarded by others as &quot;buddhavacana&quot;.

In Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, what is considered &quot;buddhavacana&quot; is collected in the Kangyur (&#x27;The Translation of the Word&#x27;). The East Asian and Tibetan Buddhist Canons always combined &quot;buddhavacana&quot; with other literature in their standard collected editions. However, the general view of what is and is not &quot;buddhavacana&quot; is broadly similar between East Asian Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. The Tibetan Kangyur, which belongs to the various schools of Tibetan Vajrayāna Buddhism, in addition to containing sutras and Vinaya, also contains Buddhist tantras and other related Tantric literature.

== The texts of the early Buddhist schools ==

=== Early Buddhist texts ===


The earliest Buddhist texts were passed down orally in Middle Indo-Aryan languages called Prakrits, including Gāndhārī language, the early Magadhan language and Pāli through the use of repetition, communal recitation and mnemonic devices. These texts were later compiled into canons and written down in manuscripts. For example, the Pāli Canon was preserved in Sri Lanka where it was first written down in the first century BCE.

There are early texts from various Buddhist schools, the largest collections are from the Theravāda and Sarvāstivāda schools, but there are also full texts and fragments from the Dharmaguptaka, Mahāsāṅghika, Mahīśāsaka, Mūlasarvāstivāda, and others. The most widely studied early Buddhist material are the first four Pāli Nikayas, as well as the corresponding Chinese Āgamas. The modern study of early pre-sectarian Buddhism often relies on comparative scholarship using these various early Buddhist sources.

Various scholars of Buddhist studies such as Richard Gombrich, Akira Hirakawa, Alexander Wynne, and A. K. Warder hold that early Buddhist texts contain material that could possibly be traced to the historical Buddha himself or at least to the early years of pre-sectarian Buddhism. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, these texts are sometimes referred to as &quot;Hinayana&quot; or &quot;Śrāvakayāna&quot;.

Although many versions of the texts of the early Buddhist schools exist, the only complete collection of texts to survive in a Middle Indo-Aryan language is the &quot;Tipiṭaka&quot; (triple basket) of the Theravāda school. The other (parts of) extant versions of the Tripitakas of early schools include the Chinese Āgamas, which includes collections by the Sarvāstivāda and the Dharmaguptaka. The Chinese Buddhist canon contains a complete collection of early sutras in Chinese translation, their content is very similar to the Pali, differing in detail but not in the core doctrinal content. The Tibetan canon contains some of these early texts as well, but not as complete collections. The earliest known Buddhist manuscripts containing early Buddhist texts are the Gandharan Buddhist Texts, dated to the 1st century BCE and constitute the Buddhist textual tradition of Gandharan Buddhism which was an important link between Indian and East Asian Buddhism. Parts of what is likely to be the canon of the Dharmaguptaka can be found among these Gandharan Buddhist Texts.

There are different genres of early Buddhist texts, including prose &quot;suttas&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;sūtra&quot;, discourses), disciplinary works (&quot;Vinaya&quot;), various forms of verse compositions (such as &quot;gāthā&quot; and &quot;udāna&quot;), mixed prose and verse works (&quot;geya&quot;), and also lists (&quot;matika&quot;) of monastic rules or doctrinal topics. A large portion of Early Buddhist literature is part of the &quot;sutta&quot; or &quot;sutra&quot; genre. The &quot;Sūtras&quot; (Sanskrit; Pāli: &quot;Sutta&quot;) are mostly discourses attributed to the Buddha or one of his close disciples. They are considered to be &quot;buddhavacana&quot; by all schools. The Buddha&#x27;s discourses were perhaps originally organised according to the style in which they were delivered. They were later organized into collections called &quot;Nikāyas&quot; (&#x27;volumes&#x27;) or &quot;Āgamas&quot; (&#x27;scriptures&#x27;), which were further collected into the &quot;Sūtra Piṭaka&quot; (&quot;Basket of Discourses&quot;) of the canons of the early Buddhist schools.

Most of the early sutras that have survived are from Sthavira nikaya schools, no complete collection has survived from the other early branch of Buddhism, the Mahāsāṃghika. However, some individual texts have survived, such as the &quot;Śālistamba Sūtra&quot; (rice stalk sūtra). This &quot;sūtra&quot; contains many parallel passages to the Pali suttas. As noted by N. Ross Reat, this text is in general agreement with the basic doctrines of the early sutras of the Sthavira schools such as dependent origination, the &quot;middle way&quot; between eternalism and annihilationism, the &quot;five aggregates&quot;, the &quot;three unwholesome roots&quot;, the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. Another important source for Mahāsāṃghika sutras is the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; (&quot;Great Event&quot;), which is a collection of various texts compiled into a biography of the Buddha. Within it can be found quotations and whole sutras, such as the Mahāsāṃghika version of the &quot;Dharmacakrapravartana&quot;.

The other major type of text aside from the sutras are the Vinayas. Vinaya literature is primarily concerned with aspects of the monastic discipline and the rules and procedures that govern the Buddhist monastic community (sangha). However, Vinaya as a term is also contrasted with Dharma, where the pair (Dhamma-Vinaya) mean something like &#x27;doctrine and discipline&#x27;. The Vinaya literature in fact contains a considerable range of texts. There are, of course, those that discuss the monastic rules, how they came about, how they developed, and how they were applied. But the vinaya also contains some doctrinal expositions, ritual and liturgical texts, biographical stories, and some elements of the &quot;Jatakas&quot;, or birth stories. Various Vinaya collections survive in full, including those of the following schools: Theravāda (in Pali), Mula-Sarvāstivāda (in Tibetan translation) and the Mahāsānghika, Sarvāstivāda, Mahīshāsika, and Dharmaguptaka (in Chinese translations). In addition, portions survive of a number of Vinayas in various languages.

Aside from the Sutras and the Vinayas, some schools also had collections of &quot;minor&quot; or miscellaneous texts. The Theravāda &quot;Khuddaka Nikāya&quot; (&#x27;Minor Collection&#x27;) is one example of such a collection, while there is evidence that the Dharmaguptaka school had a similar collection, known as the &quot;Kṣudraka Āgam&quot;a. Fragments of the Dharmaguptaka minor collection have been found in Gandhari. The Sarvāstivāda school also seems to have had a &quot;Kṣudraka&quot; collection of texts, but they did not see it as an &quot;Āgama&quot;. These &quot;minor&quot; collections seem to have been a category for miscellaneous texts, and was perhaps never definitively established among many early Buddhist schools.

Early Buddhist texts which appear in such &quot;minor&quot; collections include:

* The &quot;Dharmapadas&quot;. These texts are collections of sayings and aphorisms, the most well known of which is the Pali &quot;Dhammapada&quot;, but there are various versions in different languages, such as the &quot;Patna Dharmapada&quot; and the &quot;Gāndhārī Dharmapada&quot;. 
* The Pali &quot;Udana&quot; and the Sarvāstivāda &quot;Udānavarga&quot;. These are other collections of &quot;inspired sayings&quot;.
*The Pali &quot;Itivuttaka&quot; (&quot;as it was said&quot;) and the Chinese translation of the &quot;Itivṛttaka&quot; (本事經) by Xuanzang.
* The Pali &quot;Sutta Nipata&quot;, including texts such as the &quot;Aṭṭhakavagga&quot; and &quot;Pārāyanavagga&quot;. There is also a parallel in the Chinese translation of the &quot;Arthavargīya.&quot;
*&quot;Theragāthā&quot; and &quot;Therīgāthā&quot; two collections of verses related to the elder disciples of the Buddha. A Sanskrit &quot;Sthaviragāthā&quot; is also known to have existed.

=== Abhidharma texts ===
Abhidharma (in Pāli, &quot;Abhidhamma&quot;) texts which contain &quot;an abstract and highly technical systematization&quot; of doctrinal material appearing in the Buddhist sutras. It is an attempt to best express the Buddhist view of &quot;ultimate reality&quot; (&quot;paramartha-satya&quot;) without using the conventional language and narrative stories found in the sutras. The prominent modern scholar of Abhidharma, Erich Frauwallner has said that these Buddhist systems are &quot;among the major achievements of the classical period of Indian philosophy.&quot; Modern scholars generally believe that the canonical Abhidharma texts emerged after the time of the Buddha, in around the 3rd century BCE. Therefore, the canonical Abhidharma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of later Buddhists.

There are different types and historical layers of Abhidharma literature. The early canonical Abhidharma works (like the &quot;Abhidhamma Pitaka&quot;) are not philosophical treatises, but mainly summaries and expositions of early doctrinal lists with their accompanying explanations. These texts developed out of early Buddhist lists or matrices (&quot;mātṛkās&quot;) of key teachings, such as the 37 factors leading to Awakening. Scholars like Erich Frauwallner have argued that there is an &quot;ancient core&quot; of early pre-sectarian material in the earliest Abhidharma works, such as in the Theravada &quot;Vibhanga&quot;, the &quot;Dharmaskandha&quot; of the Sarvastivada, and the &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; of the Dharmaguptaka school.

Only two full canonical Abhidharma collections have survived both containing seven texts, the Theravāda Abhidhamma and the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which survives in Chinese translation. However, texts of other tradition have survived, such as the &quot;Śāriputrābhidharma&quot; of the Dharmaguptaka school, the &quot;Tattvasiddhi Śāstra&quot; (&quot;Chéngshílun&quot;), and various Abhidharma type works from the Pudgalavada school.

Later post-canonical Abhidharma works were written as either large treatises (&quot;śāstra&quot;), as commentaries (&quot;aṭṭhakathā&quot;) or as smaller introductory manuals. They are more developed philosophical works which include many innovations and doctrines not found in the canonical Abhidharma.

=== Other texts ===

The early Buddhist schools also preserved other types of texts which developed in later periods, which were variously seen as canonical or not, depending on the tradition.

One of the largest category of texts that were neither Sutra, Vinaya nor Abhidharma includes various collections of stories such as the Jātaka tales and the Avadānas (Pali: Apadāna). These are moral fables and legends dealing with the previous births of Gautama Buddha in both human and animal form. The different Buddhist schools had their own collections of these tales and often disagreed on which stories were canonical.

Another genre that developed over time in the various early schools were biographies of the Buddha. Buddha biographies include the &quot;Mahāvastu&quot; of the Lokottaravadin school, the northern tradition&#x27;s &quot;Lalitavistara Sūtra,&quot; the Theravada &quot;Nidānakathā&quot; and the Dharmaguptaka &quot;Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra.&quot;

One of the most famous of biographies is the &quot;Buddhacarita&quot;, an epic poem in Classical Sanskrit by Aśvaghoṣa. Aśvaghoṣa also wrote other poems, as well as Sanskrit dramas. Another Sanskrit Buddhist poet was Mātṛceṭa, who composed various pious hymns in slokas. Buddhist poetry is a broad genre with numerous forms and has been composed in many languages, including Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese and Japanese. Aside from the work of Aśvaghoṣa, another important Sanskrit poet was Mātr̥ceṭa, known for his &quot;One Hundred and Fifty Verses.&quot; Buddhist poetry was also written in popular Indian languages, such as Tamil and Apabhramsa. One well known poem is the Tamil epic &quot;Manimekalai,&quot; which is one of the Five Great Epics of Tamil literature.

Other later hagiographical texts include the &quot;Buddhavaṃsa,&quot; the &quot;Cariyāpiṭaka&quot; and the &quot;Vimanavatthu&quot; (as well as its Chinese parallel, the &quot;Vimānāvadāna&quot;).

There are also some unique individual texts like the &quot;Milinda pañha&quot; (literally &quot;The Questions of Milinda&quot;) and its parallel in Chinese, the &quot;Nāgasena Bhikśu Sūtra&quot; (那先比丘經). These texts depict a dialogue between the monk Nagasena, and the Indo-Greek King Menander (Pali: Milinda). It is a compendium of doctrine, and covers a range of subjects.

== Theravāda texts ==

 The Theravāda tradition has an extensive commentarial literature, much of which is still untranslated. These are attributed to scholars working in Sri Lanka such as Buddhaghosa (5th century CE) and Dhammapala. There are also sub-commentaries (&quot;ṭīkā&quot;) or commentaries on the commentaries. Buddhaghosa was also the author of the &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, or &quot;Path of Purification&quot;, which is a manual of doctrine and practice according to the Mahavihara tradition of Sri Lanka. According to Nanamoli Bhikkhu, this text is regarded as &quot;the principal non-canonical authority of the Theravada.&quot; A similar albeit shorter work is the &quot;Vimuttimagga&quot;. Another highly influential Pali Theravada work is the &quot;Abhidhammattha-sangaha&quot; (11th or 12th century), a short 50 page introductory summary to the Abhidhamma, which is widely used to teach Abhidhamma.

Buddhaghosa is known to have worked from Buddhist commentaries in the Sri Lankan Sinhala language, which are now lost. Sri Lankan literature in the vernacular contains many Buddhist works, including as classical Sinhala poems such as the &quot;Muvadevāvata&quot; (The Story of the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Birth as King Mukhadeva, 12th century) and the &quot;Sasadāvata&quot; (The Story of the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Birth as a Hare, 12th century) as well as prose works like the &quot;Dhampiyātuvā gätapadaya&quot; (Commentary on the Blessed Doctrine), a commentary on words and phrases in the Pāli Dhammapada.

The Theravāda textual tradition spread into Burma and Thailand where Pali scholarship continued to flourish with such works as the &quot;Aggavamsa&quot; of Saddaniti and the &quot;Jinakalamali&quot; of Ratanapañña. Pali literature continued to be composed into the modern era, especially in Burma, and writers such as Mahasi Sayadaw translated some of their texts into Pali.

There are also numerous Esoteric Theravada texts, mostly from Southeast Asia. This tradition flourished in Cambodia and Thailand before the 19th century reformist movement of Rama IV. One of these texts has been published in English by the Pali Text Society as &quot;Manual of a Mystic&quot;.

Burmese Buddhist literature developed unique poetic forms from the 1450s onwards, a major type of poetry is the which are long and embellished translations of Pali Buddhist works, mainly jatakas. A famous example of poetry is the (the in nine sections, 1523). There is also a genre of Burmese commentaries or which were used to teach Pali. The nineteenth century saw a flowering of Burmese Buddhist literature in various genres including religious biography, Abhidharma, legal literature and meditation literature.

An influential text of Thai literature is the &quot;Three Worlds According to King Ruang&quot; (1345) by Phya Lithai, which is an extensive Cosmological and visionary survey of the Thai Buddhist universe.

== Mahāyāna texts ==

=== Mahāyāna sūtras ===
&quot;See Mahāyāna sūtras for historical background and a list of some sutras categorised by source.&quot;


Around the beginning of the common era, a new genre of sutra literature began to be written with a focus on the Bodhisattva ideal, commonly known as &quot;Mahāyāna&quot; (&quot;Great Vehicle&quot;) or &quot;Bodhisattvayāna&quot; (&quot;Bodhisattva Vehicle&quot;). The earliest of these sutras do not call themselves &#x27;Mahāyāna,&#x27; but use the terms &quot;Vaipulya&quot; (extensive, expansive) sutras, or &quot;Gambhira&quot; (deep, profound) sutras.

There are various theories of how Mahāyāna emerged. According to David Drewes, it seems to have been &quot;primarily a textual movement, focused on the revelation, preaching, and dissemination of Mahāyāna sutras, that developed within, and never really departed from, traditional Buddhist social and institutional structures.&quot; Early &quot;dharmabhāṇakas&quot; (preachers, reciters of these sutras) were influential figures, and promoted these new texts throughout the Buddhist communities.

Many of these Mahāyāna sūtras were written in Sanskrit (in hybrid forms and in classical Sanskrit) and then later translated into the Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist canons (the Kangyur and the Taishō Tripiṭaka respectively) which then developed their own textual histories. Sanskrit had been adopted by Buddhists in north India during the Kushan era and Sanskrit Buddhist literature became the dominant tradition in Buddhist India until the decline of Buddhism there.

Mahāyāna sūtras are also generally regarded by the Mahāyāna tradition as being more profound than the śrāvaka texts as well as generating more spiritual merit and benefit. Thus, they are seen as superior and more virtuous to non-Mahāyāna sutras. The Mahāyāna sūtras are traditionally considered by Mahāyāna Buddhists to be the word of the Buddha. Mahāyāna Buddhists explained the emergence of these new texts by arguing that they had been transmitted in secret, via lineages of supernatural beings (such as the nagas) until people were ready to hear them, or by stating that they had been revealed directly through visions and meditative experiences to a select few.

According to David McMahan, the literary style of the Mahāyāna sūtras reveals how these texts were mainly composed as written works and how they also needed to legitimate themselves to other Buddhists. They used different literary and narrative ways to defend the legitimacy of these texts as Buddha word. Mahāyāna sūtras such as the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha&quot; also often criticize early Buddhist figures, such as Sariputra for lacking knowledge and goodness, and thus, these elders or śrāvaka are seen as not intelligent enough to receive the Mahāyāna teachings, while more the advanced elite, the bodhisattvas, are depicted as those who can see the highest teachings.

These sūtras were not recognized as being Buddha word by various early Buddhist schools and there was lively debate over their authenticity throughout the Buddhist world. Various Mahāyāna sūtras warn against the charge that they are not word of the Buddha, showing that they are aware of this claim. Buddhist communities such as the Mahāsāṃghika school were divided along these doctrinal lines into sub-schools which accepted or did not accept these texts. The Theravāda school of Sri Lanka also was split on the issue during the medieval period. The Mahavihara sub-sect rejected these texts and the (now extinct) Abhayagiri sect accepted them. Theravāda commentaries mention these texts (which they call &quot;Vedalla/Vetulla&quot;) as not being the Buddha word and being counterfeit scriptures. Modern Theravāda generally does not accept these texts as &quot;buddhavacana&quot; (word of the Buddha).

The Mahāyāna movement remained quite small until the fifth century, with very few manuscripts having been found before then (the exceptions are from Bamiyan). However, according to Walser, the fifth and sixth centuries saw a great increase in the production of these texts. By this time, Chinese pilgrims, such as Faxian, Yijing, and Xuanzang were traveling to India, and their writings do describe monasteries which they label &#x27;Mahāyāna&#x27; as well as monasteries where both Mahāyāna monks and non-Mahāyāna monks lived together.

Mahāyāna sūtras contain several elements besides the promotion of the bodhisattva ideal, including &quot;expanded cosmologies and mythical histories, ideas of purelands and great, &#x27;celestial&#x27; Buddhas and bodhisattvas, descriptions of powerful new religious practices, new ideas on the nature of the Buddha, and a range of new philosophical perspectives.&quot; These texts present stories of revelation in which the Buddha teaches Mahāyāna sutras to certain bodhisattvas who vow to teach and spread these sutras. These texts also promoted new religious practices that were supposed to make Buddhahood easy to achieve, such as &quot;hearing the names of certain Buddhas or bodhisattvas, maintaining Buddhist precepts, and listening to, memorizing, and copying sutras.&quot; Some Mahāyāna sūtras claim that these practices lead to rebirth in Pure lands such as Abhirati and Sukhavati, where becoming a Buddha is much easier to achieve.

Several Mahāyāna sūtras also depict important Buddhas or Bodhisattvas not found in earlier texts, such as the Buddhas Amitabha, Akshobhya and Vairocana, and the bodhisattvas Maitreya, Mañjusri, Ksitigarbha, and Avalokiteshvara. An important feature of Mahāyāna is the way that it understands the nature of Buddhahood. Mahāyāna texts see Buddhas (and to a lesser extent, certain bodhisattvas as well) as transcendental or supramundane (&quot;lokuttara&quot;) beings, who live for eons constantly helping others through their activity.

According to Paul Williams, in Mahāyāna, a Buddha is often seen as &quot;a spiritual king, relating to and caring for the world&quot;, rather than simply a teacher who after his death &quot;has completely &#x27;gone beyond&#x27; the world and its cares&quot;. Buddha Sakyamuni&#x27;s life and death on earth is then usually understood as a &quot;mere appearance&quot;, his death is an unreal show, in reality he continues to live in a transcendent reality. Thus the Buddha in the Lotus sutra says that he is &quot;the father of the world&quot;, &quot;the self existent (&quot;svayambhu&quot;)...protector of all creatures&quot;, who has &quot;never ceased to exist&quot; and only &quot;pretends to have passed away.&quot;

Hundreds of Mahāyāna sūtras have survived in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan translation. There many different genres or classes of Mahāyāna sutras, such as the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sūtra&quot;s, the &quot;Tathāgatagarbha sūtras&quot; and the Pure Land &quot;sūtra&quot;s. The different Mahāyāna schools have many varied classification schemas for organizing them and they see different texts as having higher authority than others.

Some Mahāyāna sūtras are also thought to display a distinctly tantric character, like some of the shorter Perfection of Wisdom sutras and the &quot;Mahavairocana Sutra&quot;. At least some editions of the Kangyur include the &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; in the tantra division. Such overlap is not confined to &quot;neighbouring&quot; yanas: at least nine &quot;Sravakayana&quot; texts can be found in the tantra divisions of some editions of the Kangyur. One of them, the &quot;Atanatiya Sutra&quot;, is also included in the Mikkyo (esoteric) division of the standard modern collected edition of Sino-Japanese Buddhist literature. Some Mahāyāna texts also contain &quot;dhāraṇī,&quot; which are chants that are believed to have magical and spiritual power.

*&quot;Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sūtra&quot;.

===Indian treatises===
The Mahāyāna commentarial and exegetical literature is vast. Many of these exegetical and scholastic works are called &quot;Śāstras&quot;, which can refer to a scholastic treatise, exposition or commentary.

Central to much of Mahāyāna philosophy are the works of the Indian scholar Nagarjuna. Especially important is his magnum opus, the &quot;Mūlamadhyamika-karikā&quot;, or Root Verses on the Middle Way, a seminal text on the Madhyamika philosophy. Various other authors of the Madhyamaka school followed him and wrote commentaries to his texts or their own treatises.

Another very influential work which traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna In East Asia is the &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot; (*&quot;Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa, The Great Discourse on Prajñāpāramitā&quot;). This is a massive Mahayana Buddhist treatise and commentary on the &quot;Prajñāpāramitā sutra&quot; in Twenty-five Thousand Lines, and it has been extremely important in the development of the major Chinese Buddhist traditions. Its authorship to Nagarjuna however has been questioned by modern scholars and it only survives in the Chinese translation by Kumārajīva (344–413 CE).

The &quot;Yogācārabhūmi-Śāstra&quot; (fourth century CE) is another very large treatise which focuses on yogic praxis and the doctrines of the Indian Yogacara school. Unlike the &quot;Dà zhìdù lùn&quot;, it was studied and transmitted in both the East Asian Buddhist and the Tibetan Buddhist traditions.

The works of Asanga, a great scholar and systematizer of the Yogacara, are also very influential in both traditions, including his magnum opus, the &quot;Mahāyāna-samgraha&quot;, and the &quot;Abhidharma-samuccaya&quot; (a compendium of Abhidharma thought that became the standard text for many Mahayana schools especially in Tibet). Various texts are also said to have received by Asanga from the Bodhisattva Maitreya in the Tushita god realm, including works such as &quot;Madhyāntavibhāga&quot;, the &quot;Mahāyāna-sūtrālamkāra&quot;, and the &quot;Abhisamayālamkara&quot;. Their authorship remains disputed by modern scholars however. Asanga&#x27;s brother Vasubandhu wrote a large number of texts associated with the Yogacara including: &quot;Trisvabhāva-nirdesa&quot;, &quot;Vimsatika&quot;, &quot;Trimsika&quot;, and the &quot;Abhidharmakośa-bhāsya&quot;. Numerous commentaries were written by later Yogacara exegetes on the works of these two brothers.

The 9th Century Indian Buddhist Shantideva produced two texts: the &quot;Bodhicaryāvatāra&quot; has been a strong influence in many schools of the Mahayana. It is notably a favorite text of the 14th Dalai Lama.

Dignāga is associated with a school of Buddhist logic that tried to establish which texts were valid sources of knowledge (see also Epistemology). He produced the &quot;Pramāna-samuccaya&quot;, and later Dharmakirti wrote the &quot;Pramāna-vārttikā&quot;, which was a commentary and reworking of the Dignaga text.

===East Asian works===
&quot;The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot; (&quot;Dàshéng Qǐxìn Lùn&quot;) is an influential text in East Asian Buddhism, especially in the Hua-yen school of China, and its Japanese equivalent, Kegon. While it is traditionally attributed to Ashvaghosha, most scholars now hold it is a Chinese composition.

The &quot;Dhyāna sutras&quot; (Chan-jing) are a group of early Buddhist meditation texts which contain meditation teachings from the Sarvastivada school along with some early proto-Mahayana meditations. They were mostly the work of Buddhist Yoga teachers from Kashmir and were translated into Chinese early on.
The early period of the development of Chinese Buddhism was concerned with the collection and translation of texts into Chinese and the creation of the Chinese Buddhist canon. This was often done by traveling overland to India, as recorded in the Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, by the monk Xuanzang (c. 602–664), who also wrote a commentary on Yogacara which remained influential, the &quot;Discourse on the Perfection of Consciousness-only.&quot;

East Asian Buddhism began to develop its own unique doctrinal literature with the rise of the Tiantai School and its major representative, Zhiyi (538–597 CE) who wrote important commentaries on the Lotus sutra as well as the first major comprehensive work on meditation composed in China, the &quot;Mohe Zhiguan&quot; (摩訶止観). Another important school of Chinese Buddhism is Huayan, which focused on developing their philosophical texts from the &quot;Avatamsaka&quot;. An important patriarch of this school is Fazang who wrote many commentaries and treatises.

The Tripitaka Koreana, which was crafted in two versions (the first one was destroyed by fire during the Mongol invasions of Korea), is a Korean collection of the Tripitaka carved onto 81,258 wooden printing blocks during the 13th century. Still intact in good condition after some 750 years, it has been described by the UNESCO committee as &quot;one of the most important and most complete corpus of Buddhist doctrinal texts in the world&quot;.

Zen Buddhism developed a large literary tradition based on the teachings and sayings of Chinese Zen masters. One of the key texts in this genre is the &quot;Platform Sutra&quot; attributed to Zen patriarch Huineng, it gives an autobiographical account of his succession as Ch&#x27;an Patriarch, as well as teachings about Ch&#x27;an theory and practice. Other texts are Koan collections, which are compilations of the sayings of Chinese masters such as the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; and &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;. Another key genre is that of compilations of Zen master biographies, such as the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot;. Buddhist poetry was also an important contribution to the literature of the tradition.

After the arrival of Chinese Buddhism in Japan, Korea and Vietnam; they developed their own traditions and literature in the local language.

==Vajrayana texts==


===Buddhist tantras===

The late Seventh century saw the rise of another new class of Buddhist texts, the Tantras, which focused on ritual practices and yogic techniques such as the use of Mantras, Dharanis, Mandalas, Mudras and Fire offerings.

Many early Buddhist Tantric texts, later termed &quot;action Tantras&quot; (&quot;kriyā tantra&quot;), are mostly collections of magical mantras or phrases for mostly worldly ends called &quot;mantrakalpas&quot; (mantra manuals) and they do not call themselves Tantras.

Later Tantric texts from the eighth century onward (termed variously Yogatantra, Mahayoga, and Yogini Tantras) advocated union with a deity (deity yoga), sacred sounds (mantras), techniques for manipulation of the subtle body and other secret methods with which to achieve swift Buddhahood. Some Tantras contain antinomian and practices such as ingesting alcohol and other forbidden substances as well as sexual rituals.

Some scholars such as Alexis Sanderson have argued that these later tantras, mainly the Yogini tantras, can be shown to have been influenced by non-Buddhist religious texts, mainly Tantric Śaivism and the Śaiva tantras.

In East Asian Esoteric Buddhism and its Japanese offshoot, the Shingon school, the most influential tantras are those which focus on Vairocana Buddha, mainly, the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; and the &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra.&quot;

Buddhist Tantras are key texts in Vajrayana Buddhism, which is the dominant form of Buddhism in Tibet, Bhutan and Mongolia. They can be found in the Chinese canon, but even more so in the Tibetan Kangyur which contains translations of almost 500 tantras. In the Tibetan tradition, there are various categories of tantra. The Sarma or New Translation schools of Tibetan Buddhism divide the Tantras into four main categories:

* &quot;Kriyayogatantra&quot;
* &quot;Charyayogatantra&quot;
* &quot;Yogatantra&quot;
* &quot;Anuttarayogatantra&quot;

&quot;Anuttarayogatantra&quot; (Higher Yoga Tantra) is known in the Nyingma school as &quot;Mahayoga&quot;. Some of the most influential Higher Tantras in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are the &quot;Guhyasamāja Tantra&quot;, the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot;, the &quot;Cakrasamvara Tantra&quot;, and the &quot;Kalacakra Tantra.&quot; The Nyingma school also has unique tantras of its own, not found in the other Tibetan schools, the most important of these are the Dzogchen tantras.

===Other products of the Vajrayana literature===
Tibetan Buddhism has a unique and special class of texts called &quot;terma&quot; (Tibetan: &quot;gTer-ma&quot;). These are texts (or ritual objects, etc.) believed either composed or hidden by tantric masters and/or elementally secreted or encoded in the elements and retrieved, accessed or rediscovered by other tantric masters when appropriate. Termas are discovered by tertöns (Tibetan: &quot;gTer-stons&quot;), whose special function is to reveal these texts. Some termas are hidden in caves or similar places, but a few are said to be &#x27;mind termas,&#x27; which are &#x27;discovered&#x27; in the mind of the tertön. The Nyingma school (and Bön tradition) has a large terma literature. Many of the terma texts are said to have been written by Padmasambhava, who is particularly important to the Nyingmas. Probably the best known terma text is the so-called &quot;Tibetan book of the dead&quot;, the &quot;Bardo Thodol&quot;.

A sadhana is a tantric spiritual practice text used by practitioners, primarily to practice the mandala or a particular yidam, or meditation deity. The &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; is a collection of sadhanas.

Vajrayana adepts, known as mahasiddha, often expounded their teachings in the form of songs of realization. Collections of these songs such as the &quot;Caryāgīti&quot;, or the Charyapada are still in existence. The &quot;Dohakosha&quot; is a collection of &quot;doha&quot; songs by the yogi Saraha from the 9th century. A collection known in English as &quot;The Hundred Thousand Songs of Milarepa&quot; was composed by Tibetan Buddhist yogi Milarepa and is especially popular amongst members of the Kagyu school.

The &quot;Blue Annals&quot; () completed in 1476, authored by Gölo Zhönnupel (Tibetan: &quot;gos lo gzhon nu dpal&quot;, 1392–1481), is a historical survey of Tibetan Buddhism with a marked ecumenical view, focusing upon the dissemination of various sectarian traditions throughout Tibet.

Namtar, or spiritual biographies, are another popular form of Tibetan Buddhist texts, whereby the teachings and spiritual path of a practitioner are explained through a review of their life story.

Kūkai wrote a number of treatises on Vajrayana Buddhism, and these are influential in Japanese Shingon Buddhism.

<doc id="530928" wikidata="Q85764460" url="?curid=530928" title="Greatest Hits (2002 Kylie Minogue album)">
<text>Greatest Hits (titled on the back cover as Greatest Hits 87–92 and re-titled as Vintage Kylie: The Hits 88–92) is a 2002 greatest hits album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. Released on 18 November 2002 by PWL, the album collects work from Minogue&#x27;s PWL period, including the albums &quot;Kylie&quot; (1988), &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; (1989), &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; (1990), &quot;Let&#x27;s Get to It&quot; (1991) and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1992).

An updated version of the compilation called Greatest Hits 87–97 was later released on 24 November 2003 by BMG and PWL, distributed by Jive, due to her release of &quot;Body Language&quot; in early 2004. The cover sleeve for the version was shot by British photographer Simon Fowler in 1990. This version of the album includes songs and remixes from &quot;Kylie Minogue&quot; (1994) and &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; (1997), and also received positive reception from music critics.

==Background==
After the massive success of Minogue&#x27;s eighth studio album &quot;Fever&quot;, BMG decided to release a greatest hits album.

The 2002 album cover used a stock photo photographed by Jasper James, which depicts a supposed look-alike dressed in her underwear. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus called it &quot;shoddy.&quot; The updated version of the compilation later used a picture from Minogue&#x27;s photoshoot with Simon Fowler in 1990.

The release ruffled some feathers in the Kylie camp, in particular the cover artwork. An &#x27;official&#x27; cover, designed by Kylie and her team was made available to download from her website and was also given away free inside copies of Heat magazine. Titled Vintage Kylie, the card insert bore the cheeky message &quot;Like Kylie? Why not have the real thing!&quot; A version of the compilation titled Best of was also released in France, but withdrawn from sale on day of release.

Due to Minogue&#x27;s release of her then-new album, &quot;Body Language&quot;, in February 2004, BMG re-released the compilation.

==Critical response==
Greatest Hits
Johnny Loftus from AllMusic gave the compilation two stars out of five, he felt that there&#x27;s nothing in the album feels &quot;very exclusive,&quot; with the remixes &quot;are readily available to aficionados in other, less after-market places.&quot; He also suggested readers to the 2003 version, calling it &quot;a much better option for the casual listener.&quot; Writing for Amazon.co.uk, John Galilee compared her music to &quot;fine wine&quot;, which &quot;has aged gracefully over the years&quot;, questioned the replacement of &quot;It&#x27;s No Secret&quot; with the B-side track &quot;Say the Word - I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; but concluded: &quot;The collection adds weight to Kylie&#x27;s early mentor Pete Waterman&#x27;s assertion that Stock, Aitken and Waterman would one day be viewed as the 1980s equivalent of Motown. Who would have thought back in 1988 that &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot; and &quot;Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi&quot; would become such gems?&quot;

Greatest Hits 87–97
Chris True from AllMusic gave the compilation four stars out of five, praised it as a &quot;valid and well-represented (yet oddly out of chronological order) anthology of what Americans were missing&quot; between the 15-year she first received success in the United States with &quot;Locomotion&quot; and then with &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head.&quot; &quot;For those who were surprised by her sudden reappearance, this will fill in the picture quite nicely, and for those who just couldn&#x27;t get enough of Minogue upon hearing her for the first time in 2002, &quot;Greatest Hits 87-97&quot; will surely satisfy,&quot; he stated.

==Commercial performance==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at number 20. It has spent a total of 13 weeks overall on the chart.

==Track listing==
All songs written and produced by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman except where noted.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===


===&quot;Greatest Hits 87–97&quot;===
The Japan edition replaces &quot;Je ne sais pas pourquoi&quot; and &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; with &quot;Turn It Into Love&quot; and “It’s No Secret”, and adds an previously unreleased instrumental version of “Turn It Into Love” at the end of disc 2.

<text>In optics, an Abbe prism, named for its inventor, the German physicist Ernst Abbe, is a type of constant deviation dispersive prism similar to a Pellin–Broca prism. 

==Structure==

The prism consists of a block of glass forming a right prism with 30°–60°–90° triangular faces. When in use, a beam of light enters face AB, is refracted and undergoes total internal reflection from face BC, and is refracted again on exiting face AC. The prism is designed such that one particular wavelength of the light exits the prism at a deviation angle (relative to the light&#x27;s original path) of exactly 60°. This is the minimum possible deviation of the prism, all other wavelengths being deviated by greater angles. By rotating the prism (in the plane of the diagram) around any point O on the face AB, the wavelength which is deviated by 60° can be selected.

The dispersive Abbe prism should not be confused with the non-dispersive Porro–Abbe or Abbe–Koenig prisms.

<doc id="530934" wikidata="Q1759415" url="?curid=530934" title="Pulse pressure">
<text>Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). It represents the force that the heart generates each time it contracts. Healthy pulse pressure is around 40 mmHg. A pulse pressure that is consistently 60 mmHg or greater is likely to be associated with disease, and a pulse pressure of 50 mmHg or more increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Pulse pressure is considered low if it is less than 25% of the systolic. (For example, if the systolic pressure is 120 mmHg, then the pulse pressure would be considered low if it were less than 30 mmHg, since 30 is 25% of 120.) A very low pulse pressure can be a symptom of disorders such as congestive heart failure.

== Calculation ==
Pulse pressure is calculated as the difference between the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure.

The systemic pulse pressure is approximately proportional to stroke volume, or the amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole (pump action) and inversely proportional to the compliance (similar to elasticity) of the aorta.

* &quot;Systemic pulse pressure&quot; (most commonly measured at the brachial artery in the upper arm using a Sphygmomanometer) = 
:e.g. normal 120 mmHg - 80 mmHg = 40 mmHg
: low: 
: high: 

* &quot;Pulmonary pulse pressure&quot; is normally much lower than systemic blood pressure due to the higher compliance of the pulmonary system compared to the arterial circulation. It is measured by right heart catheterization or may be estimated by transthoracic echocardiography. Normal pulmonary artery pressure is 8 mmHg–20 mmHg at rest.
:e.g. normal 15mmHg - 8mmHg = 7mmHg
:high 25mmHg - 10mmHg = 15mmHg

==Values and variation==

===Low (narrow) pulse pressure ===
A pulse pressure is considered abnormally low if it is less than 25% of the systolic value. If the pulse pressure is extremely low, i.e. 25 mmHg or less, it may indicate low stroke volume, as in congestive heart failure.

The most common cause of a low (narrow) pulse pressure is a drop in left ventricular stroke volume.
In trauma, a low or narrow pulse pressure suggests significant blood loss.

A narrow pulse pressure is also caused by aortic stenosis. This is due to the decreased stroke volume in aortic stenosis. Other conditions that can cause a narrow pulse pressure include blood loss (due to decreased blood volume), and cardiac tamponade (due to decreased filling time). In the majority of these conditions, systolic pressure decreases, while diastolic pressure remains normal, leading to a narrow pulse pressure.

In the Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome it is postulated that declining venous return reduces stroke volume and frequently results in low pulse pressure. In extreme cases, patients experience a drop in pulse pressure to 0 mm Hg upon standing, rendering them practically pulseless while upright. This condition leads to significant morbidity, as many affected individuals struggle to remain standing.

=== High (wide) pulse pressure===

==== Consistently high ====
A pulse pressure of 50 mmHg or more can increase the risk of heart disease, heart rhythm disorders, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases and events. Higher pulse pressures are also thought to play a role in eye and kidney damage from diseases such as diabetes. There are currently no drugs approved to lower pulse pressure, but some antihypertensive drugs have been shown to modestly lower pulse pressure, while other drugs used for hypertension can actually have the counterproductive side effect of increasing resting pulse pressure.

The aorta has the highest compliance in the arterial system due in part to a relatively greater proportion of elastin fibers versus smooth muscle and collagen. This serves to dampen the pulsatile ejection fraction of the left ventricle, thereby reducing the initial systolic pulse pressure, but slightly raising the subsequent diastolic phase. If the aorta becomes rigid, stiff and inextensible because of disorders, such as arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis or elastin defects (in connective tissue diseases), the pulse pressure would be higher due to less compliance of the aorta.

In hypertensive patients, a high pulse pressure can often be an indicator of conduit artery stiffness (stiffness of the major arteries). When the arterial walls are stiffer (less compliant), the heart has to beat harder to overcome the resistance from the stiff arteries, resulting in an increased pulse pressure.

Other conditions that can lead to a high pulse pressure include aortic regurgitation, aortic sclerosis, severe iron-deficiency anemia (due to decreased blood viscosity), arteriosclerosis (due to loss of arterial compliance), and hyperthyroidism (due to increased systolic pressure), or arteriovenous malformation, among others. In aortic regurgitation, the aortic valve insufficiency results in the backward flow of blood (regurgitation) that is ejected during systole, and its return to the left ventricle during diastole. This increases the systolic blood pressure, and decreases the diastolic blood pressure, leading to a widened pulse pressure.

A high pulse pressure combined with bradycardia and an irregular breathing pattern is associated with increased intracranial pressure, a condition called Cushing&#x27;s triad seen in people after head trauma with increased intracranial pressure.

Common causes of widening pulse pressure include:

* Anemia
* Aortic dissection
* Atherosclerosis
* Arteriovenous fistula
* Chronic aortic regurgitation
* Aortic root aneurysm
* Aortic root dilation
* Beri beri
* Distributive shock
* Endocarditis
* Fever
* Heart block
* Increased intracranial pressure
* Patent ductus arteriosus
* Pregnancy
* Thyrotoxicosis

==== From exercise ====
For most individuals, during aerobic exercise, the systolic pressure progressively increases while the diastolic pressure remains about the same, thereby widening the pulse pressure. These pressure changes facilitate an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output at a lower mean arterial pressure, enabling greater aerobic capacity and physical performance. The diastolic drop reflects a reduced systemic vascular resistance of the muscle arterioles in response to the exercise.

== Clinical significance ==
Pulse pressure has implications for both cardiovascular disease as well as many non-cardiovascular diseases. Even in people without other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, a consistently wide pulse pressure remains a significant independent predictor of all-cause, cardiovascular, and, in particular, coronary mortality. There is a positive correlation between high pulse pressure and markers of inflammation, such as c-reactive protein.

===Cardiovascular disease and pulse pressure===
Awareness of the effects of pulse pressure on morbidity and mortality is lacking relative to the awareness of the effects of elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. However, pulse pressure has consistently been found to be a stronger independent predictor of cardiovascular events, especially in older populations, than has systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure. This increased risk has been observed in both men and women and even when no other cardiovascular risk factors are present. The increased risk also exists even in cases in which high pulse pressure is caused by diastolic pressure decreasing over time while systolic remains steady or even slightly decreases.

A meta-analysis in 2000 showed that a 10 mmHg increase in pulse pressure was associated with a 20% increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, and a 13% increase in risk for all coronary end points. The study authors also noted that, while risks of cardiovascular end points do increase with higher systolic pressures, at any given systolic blood pressure the risk of major cardiovascular end points increases, rather than decreases, with lower diastolic levels. This suggests that interventions that lower diastolic pressure without also lowering systolic pressure (and thus lowering pulse pressure) could actually be counterproductive.

People who simultaneously have a resting diastolic pressure of less than 60 mmHg and a pulse pressure of greater than 60 mmHg have double the risk of subclinical myocardial ischaemia and a risk of stroke that is 5.85 times greater than normal. For such patients, it may be dangerous to target a peripheral systolic pressure below 120 mmHg due to the fact that this could cause the diastolic blood pressure in the cerebral cortex in the brain to become so low that perfusion (blood flow) is insufficient, leading to white matter lesions. Nearly all coronary perfusion and more than half of cerebral perfusion occurs during diastole, thus a diastolic pressure that is too low can cause harm to both the heart and the brain.

Increased pulse pressure is also a risk factor for the development of atrial fibrillation.

===Effects of medications on pulse pressure===
There are no drugs currently approved to lower pulse pressure. Although some anti-hypertensive drugs currently on the market may have the effect of modestly lowering pulse pressure, others may actually have the counterproductive effect of increasing pulse pressure. Among classes of drugs currently on the market, a 2020 review stated that thiazide diuretics and long‐acting nitrates are the two most effective at lowering pulse pressure.

It has been hypothesized that vasopeptidase inhibitors and nitric oxide donors may be useful at lowering pulse pressure in patients with elevated pulse pressure by increasing the distensibility of the large arteries. There is evidence that glyceryl trinitrate, a nitric oxide donor, may be effective at lowering both pulse pressure and overall blood pressure in patients with acute and sub-acute stroke. 

A 2001 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 1,292 males, compared the effects of hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic), atenolol (a beta-blocker), captopril (an ACE inhibitor), clonidine (a central α-agonist), diltiazem (a calcium channel blocker), and prazosin (an α-blocker) on pulse pressure and found that, after one year of treatment, hydrochlorothiazide was the most effective at lowering pulse pressure, with an average decrease of 8.6 mmHg. Captopril and atenolol were equal as least effective, with an average decrease of 4.1 mmHg. Clonidine (decrease of 6.3 mmHg), diltiazem (decrease of 5.5 mmHg), and prazosin (decrease of 5.0 mmHg) were intermediate.

===Pulse pressure and sepsis===
Diastolic blood pressure falls during the early stages of sepsis, causing a widening of pulse pressure. If sepsis becomes severe and hemodynamic compromise advances, the systolic pressure also decreases, causing a narrowing of pulse pressure. A pulse pressure of over 70 mmHg in patients with sepsis is correlated with an increased chance of survival. A widened pulse pressure is also correlated with an increased chance that someone with sepsis will benefit from and respond to IV fluids.

<text>Philip Andre &quot;Mickey&quot; Rourke Jr. ( ; born September 16, 1952) is an American actor and former professional boxer who has appeared primarily as a leading man in drama, action, and thriller films. 

During the 1980s, Rourke played supporting roles in films like &quot;Body Heat&quot; (1981) and &quot;Diner&quot; (1982), for which he won the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actor. Since then he established himself as an acclaimed leading man in drama films such as &quot;Rumble Fish&quot; (1983), &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot; (1984), &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; (1985), &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; (1986), &quot;Angel Heart&quot; (1987), &quot;Francesco&quot; (1989), and &quot;Johnny Handsome&quot; (1989). His performance in Charles Bukowski biopic &quot;Barfly&quot; (1987) has earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead nomination. In 1991, following a string of critical and commercial failures, Rourke—who trained as a boxer in his early years—left acting and became a professional boxer for a time.

After retiring from boxing in 1994, Rourke returned to acting and had supporting roles in several films such as &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1997), &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot; (1998), &quot;Animal Factory&quot;, &quot;Get Carter&quot; (both 2000), &quot;The Pledge&quot; (2001), &quot;Spun&quot; (2002), &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003), &quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004) and &quot;Domino&quot; (2005). In 2005, Rourke made a comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role in the neo-noir action thriller &quot;Sin City&quot;, for which he won awards from the Chicago Film Critics Association, the Irish Film and Television Awards, and the Online Film Critics Society.

This comeback culminated in his portraying aging wrestler Randy &#x27;The Ram&#x27; Robinson in the sports drama film &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008). For the role, Rourke won the Golden Globe Award and BAFTA Award for Best Actor, and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor. After this, Rourke appeared in several commercially successful films; &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, &quot;The Expendables&quot; (both 2010) and &quot;Immortals&quot; (2011), before primarily going on to work in mostly direct-to-video productions and some independent films such as &quot;Ashby&quot; (2015), &quot;Nightmare Cinema&quot; (2018), and &quot;The Palace&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Philip Andre Rourke Jr. was born on September 16, 1952, in Schenectady, New York, to Annette (&quot;née&quot; Cameron) and Philip Andre Rourke (1924–1982). He has Irish and French ancestry. He was raised Catholic and still practices his faith. His father left the family when Rourke was young. After his parents divorced, his mother married Eugene Addis, a Miami Beach police officer with five sons, and moved Rourke and two younger siblings to South Florida. There, he graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1971.

==Career==
===Amateur boxing===

During his teenage years, Rourke focused his attention mainly on sports. He took up self-defense training at the Boys Club of Miami. It was there that he learned boxing skills and decided on an amateur career.

At age 12, Rourke won his first boxing match as a flyweight, fighting some of his early matches under the name Phil Rourke. He continued his boxing training at the famed 5th Street Gym, in Miami Beach, Florida. In 1969, Rourke, then weighing 140 pounds (63.5 kg), sparred with former World Welterweight Champion Luis Rodríguez. Rodríguez was the number one–rated middleweight (154 lb to 160 lb) boxer in the world and was training for his match with world champion Nino Benvenuti. Rourke says he received a concussion from his sparring match with Rodríguez.

At the 1971 Florida Golden Gloves, Rourke suffered another concussion in a boxing match. After being told by doctors to take a year off and rest, Rourke temporarily retired from the ring. From 1964 to 1973, Rourke compiled an amateur boxing record of 27 wins (including 12 straight knockouts), including a first-round knockout win over John Carver and decision victories over Ronnie Carter and Javier Villanueva, and three defeats.

===Early acting roles===
In 1971, as a senior at Miami Beach Senior High School, Rourke had a small acting role in the Jay W. Jensen–directed school play &quot;The Serpent&quot;. However, Rourke&#x27;s interests were geared to boxing, and he never appeared in any other school productions. Soon after he temporarily gave up boxing, a friend at the University of Miami told Rourke about a play he was directing, &quot;Deathwatch&quot;, and how the man playing the role of Green Eyes had quit. Rourke got the part and immediately became enamored with acting. Borrowing $400 from his sister, he moved to New York, working an assortment of odd jobs while studying with Actors Studio alumni Walter Lott and Sandra Seacat. It was under the latter&#x27;s tutelage, Rourke later recalled, that &quot;everything started to click.&quot; Seacat motivated Rourke to find his father, from whom he was separated for more than twenty years.

During his appearance on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, after the release of &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, host James Lipton disclosed that Rourke had been selected to the Actors Studio in his first audition, which Elia Kazan is reported to have said was the &quot;best audition in thirty years&quot;.

Appearing primarily in television films during the late 1970s, Rourke made his feature film debut with a small role in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot;. He played Ritchie, Dennis Christopher&#x27;s bullying and ill-fated co-worker in the 1980 slasher film &quot;Fade to Black&quot;. However, it was in 1981, with his portrayal of an arsonist in &quot;Body Heat&quot;, that Rourke first received significant attention, despite his modest time on screen. The following year, he drew further critical accolades for his portrayal as the suave compulsive gambler &quot;Boogie&quot; Sheftell in Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Diner&quot;, in which Rourke co-starred, alongside Paul Reiser, Daniel Stern, Steve Guttenberg, Tim Daly and Kevin Bacon; the National Society of Film Critics named him Best Supporting Actor that year. Soon thereafter, Rourke starred in &quot;Rumble Fish&quot;, Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

Rourke&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot; alongside Daryl Hannah and Eric Roberts also caught the attention of critics, although the film was not financially successful. In the mid-1980s, Rourke earned himself additional leading roles. His role opposite Kim Basinger in the erotic drama &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; helped him gain sex symbol status. He received critical praise for his work in Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s &quot;Barfly&quot; as the alcoholic writer Henry Chinaski (the literary alter ego of Charles Bukowski), co-starring Faye Dunaway, and in &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, written by Oliver Stone.

In 1987, Rourke appeared in &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. The film was nominated for several awards. It was seen as controversial by some, owing to a sex scene involving &quot;Cosby Show&quot; cast member Lisa Bonet, who won an award for her part in the film. Although some of Rourke&#x27;s work was viewed as controversial in the US, he was well received by European, and especially French audiences, who loved the &quot;rumpled, slightly dirty, sordid ... rebel persona&quot; that he projected in &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Hours&quot;. Director Adrian Lyne said that had Rourke died after the release of &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, he would have become a bigger phenomenon than James Dean.

In the late 1980s, Rourke performed with David Bowie on the &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; album. Around the same time, he also wrote his first screenplay, &quot;Homeboy&quot;, a boxing tale in which he starred. In 1989, Rourke starred in the docudrama &quot;Francesco&quot;, portraying St. Francis of Assisi. This was followed by &quot;Wild Orchid&quot;, another critically panned film, which gained him a nomination for a Razzie award (also for &quot;Desperate Hours&quot;). In 1991, he starred in the box office bomb &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot; as Harley Davidson, a biker whose best friend, Marlboro, was played by Don Johnson. In his last role before departing for the boxing ring, Rourke played an arms dealer chased by Willem Dafoe and Samuel L. Jackson in &quot;White Sands&quot;, a film noir that reviewers found stylish but incoherent. 

Rourke&#x27;s acting career eventually became overshadowed by his personal life and career decisions. Directors such as Alan Parker found it difficult to work with him. Parker stated that &quot;working with Mickey is a nightmare. He is very dangerous on the set because you never know what he is going to do.&quot; In a documentary on the special edition DVD of &quot;Tombstone&quot;, actor Michael Biehn, who plays the part of Johnny Ringo, mentions that his role was first offered to Rourke. Rourke has allegedly turned down several roles in high-profile films, including &quot;48 Hrs.&quot;, &quot;Platoon&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot;, &quot;Top Gun&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;Rain Man&quot;, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Death Proof&quot;.

===Professional boxing career===
In 1991, Rourke decided that he &quot;had to go back to boxing&quot; because he felt that he &quot;was self-destructing ... [and] had no respect for [himself as] an actor&quot;. Rourke was undefeated in eight fights, with six wins (four by knockout) and two draws. He fought internationally in countries including Spain, Japan, and Germany. During his boxing career, Rourke suffered a number of injuries, including a broken nose, toe, and ribs, a split tongue, and a compressed cheekbone. He also suffered from short-term memory loss.

His trainer during most of his boxing career was Hells Angels member, actor, and celebrity bodyguard Chuck Zito. Freddie Roach also trained Rourke for seven fights. Rourke&#x27;s entrance song into the ring was often Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; (to which reference is made in his film &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, in which Rourke&#x27;s character enters his final match of the film to the song playing over the loudspeakers). Boxing promoters said that Rourke was too old to succeed against top-level fighters. Indeed, Rourke himself admits that entering the ring was a sort of personal test: &quot;[I] just wanted to give it a shot, test myself that way physically, while I still had time.&quot; Rourke&#x27;s boxing career resulted in a notable physical change in the 1990s, as his face needed reconstructive surgery to mend his injuries.

===Return to boxing in 2014===
On November 28, 2014, Rourke briefly returned to the boxing ring and fought 29-year-old Elliot Seymour in Moscow, Russia. It was Rourke&#x27;s first boxing match in over 20 years. Talks of him being involved in four more matches were released by Rourke himself after the match. He won the exhibition fight in the second round by TKO. The fight is not counted in his professional record since it was an exhibition match. The opponent later stated that he threw the fight, having been promised payment to take a dive in the second round.

===Record===
===1990s: Return to acting===
In the early 1990s, Rourke was offered and declined the role of Butch Coolidge, which later became Bruce Willis&#x27;s role in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. After his retirement from boxing, Rourke did accept supporting roles in several 1990s films, including Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, Vincent Gallo&#x27;s &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, Steve Buscemi&#x27;s &quot;Animal Factory&quot;, Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;The Pledge&quot;, and Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s remake of &quot;Get Carter&quot;. Rourke also has written several films under the name Sir Eddie Cook, including &quot;Bullet&quot;, in which he co-starred with Tupac Shakur.

While Rourke was also selected for a significant role in Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, his part ended up on the cutting room floor. Rourke also played a small part in the film &quot;Thursday&quot;, in which he plays a crooked cop. He also had a lead role in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Double Team&quot;, which co-starred martial arts actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and former NBA player Dennis Rodman. It was Rourke&#x27;s first over-the-top action film role, in which he played the lead villain. During that same year, he filmed &quot;Another 9½ Weeks&quot;, a sequel to &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, which received only limited distribution. He ended the 1990s with the direct-to-video films &quot;Out in Fifty&quot;, &quot;Shades&quot; and television film &quot;Shergar&quot;, about the kidnapping of Epsom Derby-winning thoroughbred racehorse Shergar. Rourke has expressed his bitterness over that period of his career, stating that he came to consider himself a &quot;has-been&quot; and lived for a time in &quot;a state of shame&quot;.

===2000–2009===

In 2001, Rourke appeared as the villain in Enrique Iglesias&#x27;s music video for &quot;Hero&quot;, which also featured Jennifer Love Hewitt. In 2002, he took the role of The Cook in Jonas Åkerlund&#x27;s &quot;Spun&quot;, teaming up once again with Eric Roberts. His first collaborations with directors Robert Rodriguez and Tony Scott, in &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; and &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, respectively, were in smaller roles. Nonetheless, these directors subsequently decided to cast Rourke in lead roles in their next films. In 2005, Rourke made his comeback in mainstream Hollywood circles with a lead role as Marv in Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s adaptation of Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;Sin City&quot;. Rourke received awards from the Chicago Film Critics Association, the IFTA, and the Online Film Critics Society, as well as Man of the Year from &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine that year. Rourke followed &quot;Sin City&quot; with a supporting role in Tony Scott&#x27;s &quot;Domino&quot; alongside Keira Knightley, in which he played a bounty hunter. Rourke played the role of &quot;The Blackbird&quot; in an adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Killshot&quot;, and appeared as Darrius Sayle in the adaptation of the Alex Rider novel &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;.

In addition, in 2004, Rourke provided the voice for &quot;Jericho&quot; in the third installment of the &quot;Driver&quot; video game series. Rourke also appeared in a 40-page story by photographer Bryan Adams for Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Zoo Magazine&quot;. In an article about Rourke&#x27;s return to steady acting roles, entitled &quot;Mickey Rourke Rising&quot;, Christopher Heard stated that actors Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, and Brad Pitt gave &quot;animated praise for Rourke and his work&quot;. During a roundtable session of Oscar-nominated actors held by &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Brad Pitt cited Rourke as one of his early acting heroes along with Sean Penn and Gary Oldman.

Despite having withdrawn from acting at various points, and having made films that he now sees as a creative &quot;sellout&quot; (the action film &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot;), Rourke stated that &quot;all that I have been through ...[has] made me a better, more interesting actor&quot;. Rourke&#x27;s renewed interest in pursuing acting can be seen in his statement that &quot;my best work is still ahead of me&quot;.

Rourke had a role in the film version of &quot;The Informers&quot;, playing Peter, an amoral former studio security guard who plots to kidnap a small child. In 2008, Rourke played the lead in Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &quot;The Wrestler&quot;, winner of the Golden Lion Award for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival, about washed-up professional wrestler Randy &quot;The Ram&quot; Robinson. Regarding first reading the screenplay, he stated that he originally &quot;didn&#x27;t care for it&quot;.

He also spoke on personal concern and hesitance of being in a film about wrestling, for he perceived it as being &quot;pre-arranged and pre-choreographed&quot;. As he trained for the film, he developed an appreciation and respect for what real-life pro wrestlers do to prepare for the ring:

He trained under former WWE wrestler Afa the Wild Samoan for the part, and has received a BAFTA award, a Golden Globe award, an Independent Spirit Award, and an Oscar nomination as Best Actor. Rourke lost the Oscar to Sean Penn, while Penn did acknowledge Rourke in his acceptance speech.

Rourke has written or co-written six scripts: &quot;Homeboy&quot;, &quot;The Last Ride&quot;, &quot;Bullet&quot;, &quot;Killer Moon&quot;, &quot;Penance&quot; and the latest, &quot;Pain&quot;. Of these, the first three were produced as films between 1988 and 1996.
 In early 2009, Rourke developed a small feud with WWE wrestler Chris Jericho, as part of a storyline. The storyline climaxed at WrestleMania XXV, when Rourke knocked out Jericho with a left hook after Jericho won his match against Jimmy Snuka, Ricky Steamboat, and Roddy Piper, with Ric Flair in their corner. In 2009, Rourke starred in John Rich&#x27;s music video for Shuttin&#x27; Detroit Down alongside Kris Kristofferson. In 2009, he voiced protagonist US Navy SEAL Dick Marcinko in the video game &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;.

===2010–present===
In 2010, Rourke played the role of the main villain Whiplash in the film &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. In an interview with New Zealand magazine &quot;Rip It Up&quot; magazine he revealed that he prepared for the role by visiting Russian jail inmates. In 2011, he portrayed the villainous King Hyperion in &quot;Immortals&quot; and received praise for his performance, while the film received mixed-to-positive reviews and became a box office success. He also had a minor role as Tool in Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s &quot;The Expendables&quot;. Though he had little screen time, his performance was met with rave reviews and cited as one of the film&#x27;s highlights.

Just before the end of the year, he confirmed on a British TV talk show that he would play Gareth Thomas in an upcoming film about the Welsh rugby star who came out as gay the previous year. As of February 2011, he began research on the film, but noted, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to make this movie until we&#x27;ve done all the proper research. We need to do our homework and I need to train for from nine to eleven months.&quot; In 2011, Rourke was cast in the film &quot;Java Heat&quot; as an American citizen shadowing terrorist groups in Java, Indonesia. The film was released in 2013. In 2014, he reprised his Marv role from &quot;Sin City&quot; in the sequel &quot;Sin City: A Dame to Kill For&quot;.

In 2020, Rourke competed in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Gremlin&quot; and sang &quot;Stand by Me&quot; by Ben E. King. After the performance, the Gremlin costume became too hot for him and he ended up unmasking himself before the audience could even vote for their favorite performer.

In the 2021 film &quot;Man of God&quot;, which is on the life of St Nectarios of Aegina, Rourke plays the role of a paralyzed man.

In 2023, he starred in Roman Polanski&#x27;s drama film &quot;The Palace&quot;.

==Other works==
Rourke provided the mid-song rap on the David Bowie song &quot;Shining Star (Makin&#x27; My Love)&quot; on his album &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (1987).

Rourke made his stage debut in a revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;. He lent his voice to the video games &quot;Driv3r&quot; (2004) as Charles Jericho and &quot;True Crime: New York City&quot; (2005) as Terrence &quot;Terry&quot; Higgins, which was his fifth and last work with actor Christopher Walken. He also appeared in a Japanese TV commercial for Suntory Reserve (early &#x27;90s) and a commercial for Daihatsu and Lark cigarettes. In 2009, Rourke voiced the character of Dick Marcinko for the biographical video game &quot;Rogue Warrior&quot;, which was released on December 1, 2009. Rourke&#x27;s portrayal of Marcinko was a source of humorous praise from a few critics (although many others criticized Rourke&#x27;s role to the same degree that they did every other aspect of the game).

In 2010, he appeared in a Dutch TV commercial for Bavaria Beer.

Rourke appeared as a gangster in the music video for &quot;Hero&quot; by Enrique Iglesias. Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt also made an appearance in the clip.

Rourke has been the subject of two extensive biographies on his life and career &quot;Stand Alone: The Films of Mickey Rourke&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Outlaw: The Life of Mickey Rourke&quot; both were written by British author Saurav Dutt. In 2014, Dutt announced he was producing and writing a novelization inspired by an undeveloped script for a movie that Rourke wrote titled &quot;Wild Horses&quot; which was eventually released in Fall 2015.

==Personal life==
Rourke has dated several celebrities, including Terry Farrell and Sasha Volkova. He has been married twice and does not have children. In 1981, he married Debra Feuer, whom he met on the set of TV movie &quot;Hardcase&quot; and who co-starred with him in &quot;Homeboy&quot; (1988) as his love interest. The marriage ended in 1989, with Rourke subsequently commenting that making the film &quot;9½ Weeks&quot; &quot;was not particularly considerate to my wife&#x27;s needs.&quot; The two have remained good friends, according to an interview Feuer gave in 2009.

Rourke married &quot;Wild Orchid&quot; co-star Carré Otis on June 26, 1992. In 1994, Rourke was arrested on suspicion of spousal abuse. The charges were later dropped and the couple reconciled before starring together in &quot;Exit in Red.&quot; Their marriage ultimately ended in December 1998. 

In November 2007, Rourke was arrested again, this time on DUI charges in Miami Beach.

In numerous TV and print interviews, he attributes his comeback after 14 years to his agent David A. Unger, weekly meetings with a psychiatrist, &quot;Steve&quot;, and a Catholic priest, Father Peter Colapietro. Rourke had been described as a &quot;real good Catholic&quot; by late friend Tom Sizemore.

From 2009 to 2015, Rourke was in a relationship with Ukrainian-born German model Anastassija Makarenko.
Mickey stated during an interview with Piers Morgan on July 12, 2022, he has been single for the past 7 years. In 2023, it was revealed that Rourke had begun training in Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

=== Political views ===

In May 1989, Rourke revealed that he donated most of his £1.5 million earnings from starring in &quot;Francesco&quot; to support Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) member Joe Doherty&#x27;s campaign to receive political asylum in the United States. Doherty was wanted by the British government for his role in the killing of Grenadier Guards officer Herbert Westmacott. After being arrested in the U.S. in 1983, Doherty&#x27;s campaign became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; as he fought an ultimately unsuccessful nine-year legal battle against being extradited. Rourke&#x27;s donation was criticized by victims of IRA bombing attacks in England. Doherty was eventually deported to Northern Ireland and imprisoned, but was subsequently released under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.

In June 2006, Rourke publicly supported U.S. President George W. Bush and American involvement in the Iraq War. In January 2009, Rourke expressed admiration for Bush in an interview with &quot;GQ&quot; magazine. In the interview, Rourke also expressed his astonishment that Islamic fundamentalists were allowed to continue their activities in Britain after the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

In August 2014, Rourke came under scrutiny for purchasing and wearing a T-shirt bearing the likeness of Russian President Vladimir Putin at a time when most of the Western world was criticizing and sanctioning Russia due to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. When questioned by the press, Rourke explained: &quot;If I didn&#x27;t like him, I wouldn&#x27;t buy the T-shirt, believe me. I met him a couple of times and he was a real gentleman. A very cool, regular guy. Looked me right in the eye. Good guy.&quot; However, Rourke has since denounced Putin for his role in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has urged him to end the conflict.

In 2015, Rourke expressed his support for the Ben Carson 2016 presidential campaign. He also denounced Republican frontrunner Donald Trump as a &quot;bully&quot;. Rourke revealed that he has had a personal vendetta against Trump after an incident in which Trump sued both him and Tupac Shakur in the 1990s. Rourke has since been very vocal in his criticisms of Trump&#x27;s presidency, referring to him as a &quot;Garbage Can&quot; president. In 2022, Rourke claimed that Trump had sent the United States Secret Service to visit him as a result of his comments on Trump.

In July 2020, Rourke expressed support for Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election on his Instagram account, encouraging him to &quot;Go get his fat ass, Joe @joebiden&quot; and showing disapproval for Trump. In August, he expressed support for Kamala Harris following her nomination for vice president in the 2020 United States presidential election following previous approval of her earlier in July. In October, Rourke voted for Biden and Harris which he said was the first time he had ever voted.

===Dogs===
In addition to his faith, Rourke has publicly attributed his comeback to his dogs. He is well known as a pet lover, particularly fond of small-breed dogs. A spay/neuter advocate, Rourke participated in a protest outside a pet shop in 2007 and has done a public service announcement for PETA.

His first little dog was reportedly a gift from his second wife. Though Rourke&#x27;s dogs are generally referred to as &quot;chihuahuas&quot;, some are not purebred. Loki, his most-publicized dog whom he described as &quot;the love of my life&quot;, was a chihuahua-terrier mix. So reliant was Rourke on Loki&#x27;s companionship, he spent US$5,400 to have her flown to England while he was on the set of the film &quot;Stormbreaker&quot;.

Rourke gave his dogs credit during his Golden Globe Best Actor acceptance speech January 11, 2009: &quot;I&#x27;d like to thank all my dogs. The ones that are here, the ones that aren&#x27;t here anymore because sometimes when a man&#x27;s alone, that&#x27;s all you got is your dog. And they&#x27;ve meant the world to me.&quot; The day of the 2009 Golden Globes, he told Barbara Walters that &quot;I sort of self-destructed and everything came out about 14 years ago or so ... the wife had left, the career was over, the money was not an ounce. The dogs were there when no one else was there.&quot; Asked by Walters if he had considered suicide, he responded:

Beau Jack sired two of Rourke&#x27;s later pets, Loki and her littermate Chocolate. Beau Jack died in 2002, although Rourke reportedly gave him 45 minutes of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Chocolate was the subject of a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Chocolate at the Four Seasons&quot;, about his temporary stay with producer Bonnie Timmermann. Chocolate returned to Rourke and died in 2006. In addition to those dogs and several other past pets, Rourke currently owns a chihuahua named Jaws who appeared with him in his 2009 PETA ad, as well as in the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;. He has had as many as seven dogs at one time, back in 2005. Jaws originally was named &quot;Little Mickey&quot; and was originally slated to be euthanized. Rourke also believed Jaws was previously abused. At the time of his Golden Globes tribute to his pets, Rourke owned five chihuahuas: Loki, Jaws, Ruby Baby, La Negra and Bella Loca. About a month later, on February 16, 2009, Loki died in Rourke&#x27;s arms at the age of 18.

<text>The .357 SIG (designated as the 357 Sig by the SAAMI and 357 SIG by the C.I.P. or 9×22 mm in official metric notation) is a bottlenecked rimless centerfire handgun cartridge developed by the Swiss-German firearms manufacturer SIG Sauer, in cooperation with ammunition manufacturer Federal Premium. The cartridge is used by a number of law enforcement agencies.

==History==

The .357 SIG is based on a necked-down 10mm Auto case, forgoing the large pistol primer utilized by the 10mm Auto in favor of the small pistol primer used in many common self-defense rounds, such as .40 S&amp;W, .38 Special, 9 mm and other similarly-sized cartridges. Excluding specialized wildcat cartridges used in competition shooting — e.g., the 9×25mm Dillon, which necked a 10mm Auto case down to a 9 mm bullet — the .357 SIG was the first modern bottlenecked handgun cartridge to become commercially available since the 1961 introduction of Winchester&#x27;s now-obsolete .256 Winchester Magnum, a .257 caliber round based on the .357 Magnum. Later the same year Remington and Smith &amp; Wesson began jointly developing a similar round and, before the year&#x27;s end, introduced the .22 Remington Jet, a .357 Magnum case necked down to accommodate a .22 caliber bullet.

Despite its favorable ballistics and performance, the .357 SIG has not achieved the widespread adoption seen with similar cartridges. One factor preventing the round from achieving greater popularity could be the cost of the ammunition, which frequently reaches double the expense of 9 mm, .40 S&amp;W or .45 ACP ammunition. Because of this, as well as availability issues, some law enforcement agencies that previously adopted the cartridge have reportedly began to move away from the .357 SIG in favor of more common rounds with comparable performance.

==Cartridge dimensions==
The .357 SIG has 1.27 ml (19.5 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity.

&quot;.357 SIG maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions&quot;. All sizes in millimeters.

Several sources have published contradicting information regarding .357 SIG headspacing. This is due to the cartridge having been originally designed as a .357 (9.02 mm) round, but then rapidly adapted to the .355 (9 mm) bullet. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente Pour L&#x27;Epreuve Des Armes A Feu Portatives) 2008 revised documents, the .357 SIG headspaces on the case mouth (H2). Some US sources are in conflict with this standard. However, the cartridge and chamber drawing in the ANSI/SAAMI American National Standards also clearly shows the cartridge headspacing on the case mouth. Likewise, US reloading supplier Lyman has published that the .357 SIG headspaces on the case mouth.

According to the C.I.P. rulings the .357 SIG case can handle up to 305 MPa (44,236 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every pistol cartridge combo has to be proofed at 130% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.&lt;br&gt;
The SAAMI pressure limit for the .357 SIG is set at 275.80 MPa (40,000 psi), piezo pressure.

==Conversions==
While it is based on a 10 mm case necked down to accept bullets, the .357 SIG cartridge case is slightly longer than the .40 S&amp;W by to total. Most .40 S&amp;W pistols can be converted to .357 SIG by replacing the barrel, but sometimes the recoil spring must also be changed. Pistols with especially strong recoil springs can accept either cartridge with a barrel change. Magazines will freely interchange between the two cartridges in most pistols. .357 SIG barrel kits have allowed this cartridge to gain in popularity among handgun owners.

==Performance==
The table below shows common performance parameters for several .357 SIG loads. Bullet weights ranging from have been offered. Loads are available with energies from to , and penetration depths from to over are available for various applications and risk assessments. Underwood now also offers a standard pressure 65 gr .357 SIG Xtreme Defender (XD) round with a muzzle velocity of 2,100 fps, muzzle energy of 636 ft. lbs. and a penetration depth of 17.5 inches.

&quot;Key:&quot;
&quot;Expansion&quot; – expanded bullet diameter (ballistic gelatin).
&quot;Penetration&quot; – penetration depth (ballistic gelatin).
&quot;PC&quot; – permanent cavity volume (ballistic gelatin, FBI method).
&quot;TSC&quot; – temporary stretch cavity volume (ballistic gelatin).

Because of its relatively high velocity for a handgun round, the .357 SIG has an unusually flat trajectory, extending the effective range. However, it does not quite reach the performance of the .357 Magnum with bullets heavier than . Offsetting this general slight disadvantage in performance is that semi-automatic pistols tend to carry considerably more ammunition than revolvers.

The Virginia State Police has reported that attacking dogs have been stopped dead in their tracks by a single shot, whereas the former 147 grain 9 mm duty rounds would require multiple shots to incapacitate the animals. Proponents of the hydrostatic shock theory contend that the energy available in the .357 SIG is sufficient for imparting hydrostatic shock with well-designed bullets. Users have commented, &quot;We&#x27;re really impressed with the stopping power of the .357 SIG round.&quot;

The bottleneck shape of the .357 SIG cartridge makes feeding problems almost non-existent.

The &quot;Accurate Powder&quot; reloading manual claims that it is &quot;without a doubt the most ballistically consistent handgun cartridge we have ever worked with&quot;.

==Characteristics==
The goal of the .357 SIG project was to offer a level of performance equal to the highly effective .357 Magnum load. Measurements of standard factory .357 SIG cartridges loaded with bullets showed approximate muzzle velocities of out of a barrel, which is essentially identical to the .357 Magnum with the same bullet weight and barrel length. These measurements were performed with a Thompson Center Encore 1842 break-action, single-shot pistol-rifle, preventing differing barrel length definitions between semi-automatic pistols and revolvers giving revolvers a potential muzzle velocity advantage.

With a simplistic approach to physics, recoil being directly proportional to &quot;muzzle velocity × bullet mass&quot; (due to conservation of momentum), the recoil of the .357 SIG is equal to or slightly less than that of the .40 S&amp;W, and less than that of the full-power 10mm Auto loads or the original .357 Magnum. This simple approach to recoil is, however, incomplete, since the properties of the bullet alone do not determine the felt recoil; the rocket-like blast of propellant gases exiting the barrel after the bullet leaves the muzzle also plays a role. A more accurate view on recoil is that it is proportional to the mass of all ejecta × velocity of ejecta.

In comparing the energy levels of premium self-defense ammunition, the muzzle energy of of the .357 SIG load is greater than either the generated by a Speer GoldDot .40 S&amp;W load or the generated by a Speer GoldDot .40 S&amp;W load.

==Implementation==
In 1994 Sig released the P229 pistol, the first production handgun chambered in .357 SIG, specifically designed to handle the higher pressures of that round.

However, in 2013 the Texas DPS decided to replace their .357 SIG handguns with 9 mm handguns. The ability to carry more rounds per magazine (9 mm vs. .357 SIG) in a lighter gun were among the stated reasons for the change. That transition was suspended after recruits in the A-2014 class, the first to train with the new S&amp;W M&amp;P 9 mm polymer handguns, experienced numerous malfunctions with those weapons.

The newer SIG Sauer P229 in .357 SIG has been adopted for use by agents and officers of the following national and state law enforcement organizations (LEO):
* Federal Air Marshals
* Delaware State Police
* Texas Ranger Division
* Virginia State Police
* Richmond Police Department
* Rhode Island State Police
* U.S. Secret Service prior to 2019

<text>The Barcelona Metro (Catalan and Spanish: ) is a rapid transit network that runs mostly underground in central Barcelona and into the city&#x27;s suburbs. It is part of the larger public transport system of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, Spain, with unified fares under the (ATM) scheme. As of 2024, the network is operated by two separate companies: (TMB) and (FGC). It is made up of 12 lines, combining the lines owned by the two companies. Two lines, L9 and L10, are being built at present, with both lines having different sections of each opened between 2009 and 2018. They are due to be fully completed in 2030. Three lines on the network have opened as automatic train operation/driverless vehicle systems since 2009: Line 11 being converted to driverless first, and then Lines 9 and 10, opening up driverless. 

It is one of only two metros worldwide to operate on three different track gauges, being on line 8, older Iberian gauge on line 1, and on the remaining lines; the other metro with three gauges being the Toei Subway in Tokyo, which uses two narrow gauges and standard gauge. It is the only metro worldwide to operate on both narrow and broad gauge tracks.

The network length is , with 183 stations, as of November 2021. It uses spare power from its regenerative braking to power charging stations in the vicinity of its infrastructure.

== History ==

The first rapid transit railway service in Barcelona was founded in 1863 by the private company &quot;Ferrocarril de Barcelona a Sarrià&quot; (&quot;Railway from Barcelona to Sarrià&quot;, after 1916 Sarrià joined the municipality of Barcelona). Later this line evolved in what now is basically the current L6 metro service. This railway system, now part of the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya company, was later inspired by the London Underground naming style having long names for the lines (&quot;Sarrià line&quot;, &quot;Balmes line&quot;...).

Much later, in the 1920s, a second and a third rapid transit railway systems were founded with the construction of the &quot;Gran Metro&quot; between Lesseps and the Plaça de Catalunya (part of the modern L3) and, two years later, the &quot;Metro Transversal&quot; (now part of L1). This third one was built between the Plaça de Catalunya and la Bordeta to link the city centre with the Plaça d&#x27;Espanya and Montjuïc, the site of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. These two later rapid transit companies contrasted with the first one in being inspired by the &quot;Métropolitain de Paris&quot; (named after the Metropolitan Railway, from where the word &quot;metro&quot; comes).

As of 2022, the network consists of 12 lines managed by 2 different operators: Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) and Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC, or Catalan Government Railways). Fares and nomenclature are controlled by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità, a citywide system that also includes local and regional buses, tramways and some commuter and regional train services.

== Network ==
Since early 2020, the total length of the network is long and 189 stations, including the TMB+FGC+Montjuïc funicular.

The major network, operated by TMB, consists of eight lines, numbered L1 to L5 and L9 to L11 (which are distinguished on network maps by different colours), covering of route and 141 stations.

FGC lines are numbered L6, L7, L8 and L12. These lines, except all of L12 and part of L7, share tracks with commuter rail lines.

The Barcelona Metro lines do not have a name of their own but are generally referred to by their colour or by the number and the names of their termini.

In addition to those, Renfe and FGC trains and the increasingly important tram routes and stations are displayed on most recent maps, including the info maps in the metro stations, all in a single variety of dark green.

=== L9 and L10 ===

Construction work is taking place currently on L9/L10, which when finished will run from Badalona and Santa Coloma de Gramenet to the Zona Franca district and El Prat International Airport. The lines, which share a central section between Bon Pastor and Can Tries | Gornal, will be the longest automated metro line in Europe, at , and combined will have 52 stations. The project was approved in 2000 but has been challenged by some technical difficulties and some of their sections are pending further geological analysis. The first section of Line 9 that runs between La Sagrera and Can Zam opened in 2009, and by June 2010 eleven new stations on the new Lines L9 and L10 had opened. As of February 2016, the 15-station, south section of Line L9 between Zona Universitària and the airport (Aeroport T1 station) opened.

== Rolling stock ==

== Tickets and pricing ==
In addition to the one-way ticket there are a number of other tickets and cards. All of the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM) transport cards are valid and can be used in the Barcelona Metro. These are:
* Airport Ticket, is a one-way ticket for a journey between Aeroport T1 and Aeroport T2 stations on metro line L9 Sud and the rest of the metro network. Standard metro tickets such as single tickets are not valid for a trip to the airport.
* T casual, which includes ten rides at a discounted price
* T usual, unlimited journeys made in 30 consecutive days from the first use
* T-16, unlimited journeys for children below 16

All of the metro stations are within fare zone 1.

== Stations ==

At the end of 2018, there are 187 operational stations in the Barcelona Metro, served by the 12 lines in current use. The average distance between 2 stations is 807.50 metres.

An overwhelming majority of stations in the network lack related buildings or structures aboveground, mostly consisting of an access with stairs, escalators or elevators. The official TMB metro indicator, a red rhombus with a M inside, remains unused by FGC lines, which use their company logo and a different rhombus-shaped logo (actually rather similar to the one used inside the Madrid Metro) inside stations. Below ground their decoration is remarkably sober, with the exception of the new stations.

=== Disused stations ===

A number of stations in the network have been closed, were never inaugurated, or have been moved to a nearby location. See the main article for more details.

== Accessibility ==
Accessibility for passengers with reduced mobility is nearing completion. , 8 out of 192 stations are not fully accessible.&lt;br&gt;

== Transportation in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona ==

The Barcelona Metro is part of a larger transportation network, regulated and fare-integrated by Autoritat del Transport Metropolità.

Among these services, there are two large systems which operate both inside and outside the city limits of Barcelona: the commuter train lines operated by Renfe, amalgamated in the Rodalies Barcelona, or Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya lines which start in the metro lines the company operates (L6, L7 and L8) and which become a fully-fledged railway system which serves most of the metropolitan area: list of FGC lines. FGC is developing metros for Sabadell and Terrassa - see Barcelona–Vallès Line.

== In popular culture ==
The Spanish psychological horror film &quot;Estación Rocafort&quot; prominently features the Barcelona subway, with the Rocafort station serving as a key setting for much of the plot. The movie draws inspiration from the dark legend surrounding the Rocafort Station. Directed by Luis Prieto, the film stars Natalia Azahara alongside Javier Gutiérrez, Valèria Sorolla and Albert Baró.

<doc id="530956" wikidata="Q1408756" url="?curid=530956" title="Soldier's Medal">
<text>The Soldier&#x27;s Medal is an individual decoration of the United States Army. It was introduced as Section 11 of the Air Corps Act, passed by the Congress of the United States on July 2, 1926. The Soldier&#x27;s Medal is equivalent to the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the Air and Space Forces&#x27; Airman&#x27;s Medal, and the Coast Guard Medal. Prior to the creation of the Airman&#x27;s Medal in 1960, airmen were awarded the Soldier&#x27;s Medal.

The criteria for the medal are: &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Medal is awarded to any person of the Armed Forces of the United States or of a friendly foreign nation who, while serving in any capacity with the Army of the United States, including Reserve Component soldiers not serving in a duty status at the time of the heroic act, distinguished himself or herself by heroism not involving conflict with an enemy.&quot;

==History==
A need to recognize acts of heroism in 1922 resulted in the War Department&#x27;s issuing orders for acts of bravery during peacetime. This led to an Act of Congress (Public Law 446-69th Congress, July 2, 1926 (44 Stat. 780)) which established the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for acts of heroism not involving actual conflict with an enemy. The Secretary of War directed that the Quartermaster General prepare and submit appropriate designs of the Soldier&#x27;s Medal per letter signed by the Adjutant General dated 11 August 1926. The medal was designed by sculptor Gaetano Cecere.

The first Soldier&#x27;s Medals were awarded on October 17, 1927, to John F. Burns and James P. Martin for their heroism during a fire and to James K. Wilson and Cleophas C. Burnett for saving people from drowning.

The period of time when the most Soldier&#x27;s Medals were awarded was World War II (at least hundreds were awarded).

Prior to the establishment of the Airman&#x27;s Medal, which was authorized on 10 August 1956 and created in 1960, the Soldier&#x27;s Medal was awarded to U.S. Air Force personnel by the Army since 26 September 1947.

==Criteria==
The distinguishing criterion for awarding the Soldier&#x27;s Medal, per Army Regulation 600–8–22, para 3–14, is &quot;The performance must have involved personal hazard or danger and the voluntary risk of life under conditions not involving conflict with an armed enemy. Awards will not be made solely on the basis of having saved a life.&quot; It is the highest honor a soldier can receive for an act of valor in a non-combat situation, held to be equal to or greater than the level which would have justified an award of the Distinguished Flying Cross had the act occurred in combat. Any enlisted American servicemember who is eligible for retirement pay will receive an increase of 10 percent in retirement pay if the level of valor was equal to that which would earn the Distinguished Service Cross. Additional awards of the medal are denoted by oak leaf clusters worn on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal.

==Appearance==
The Soldier&#x27;s Medal is issued as a 1 3/8 inch wide Bronze octagon with an eagle displayed, standing on a fasces, between two groups of stars of six and seven, above the group of six a spray of leaves. On the reverse is a shield paly of 13 pieces, on the chief the letters &quot;US,&quot; supported by sprays of laurel and oak, around the upper edge the inscription &quot;SOLDIER&#x27;S MEDAL&quot; and across the face the words &quot;FOR VALOR.&quot; In the base is a panel for the name of the recipient to be engraved. The medal is suspended from the ribbon by a rectangular-shaped metal loop with corners rounded.

The ribbon is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 3/8 inch Ultramarine Blue 67118 on each side and the center containing 13 White and Red stripes of equal width (7 White 67101 and 6 Old Glory Red 67156).

<doc id="530965" wikidata="Q212196" url="?curid=530965" title="Voice of Russia">
<text>Voice of Russia (), commonly abbreviated VOR, was the Russian government&#x27;s international radio broadcasting service from 1993 until 2014, when it was reorganised as Radio Sputnik. Its interval signal was a chime version of &#x27;Majestic&#x27; chorus from the &quot;Great Gate of Kiev&quot; portion of &quot;Pictures at an Exhibition&quot; by Mussorgsky.

==History==
Russian president Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on 22 December 1993 which reorganised Radio Moscow under a new name: Voice of Russia.

On 9 December 2013, Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a presidential decree dissolving the Voice of Russia as an agency, and merging it with RIA Novosti to form the &quot;Rossiya Segodnya&quot; international news agency.

Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Rossiya Segodnya, said in March 2014 that &quot;We will stop using obsolete radio broadcasting models, when the signal is transmitted without any control and when it is impossible to calculate who listens to it and where.&quot; The Voice of Russia ceased shortwave and European mediumwave radio broadcasts on 1 April 2014. The service continued to be available worldwide via the internet, in selected regions on satellite, and in several cities on FM, AM (in North America) or local digital radio.

==Broadcast languages==
By 2013, the Voice of Russia had been broadcasting in 38 languages, including:

*Albanian
*Armenian
*Arabic
*Azerbaijani
*Bengali
*Bulgarian
*Chinese
*Crimean Tatar
*Czech
*Dari
*English
*French
*German
*Hausa
*Hindi
*Hungarian
*Italian
*Japanese
*Kurdish
*Kyrgyz
*Moldovan
*Mongolian
*Norwegian
*Pashto
*Persian
*Polish
*Portuguese
*Russian
*Serbian
*Spanish
*Turkish
*Ukrainian

<text>A digital stamp in crafting, stamping, card making and scrapbooking is a digital image printed onto paper from the user&#x27;s printer. Digital stamps come in a variety of formats, including PNG, JPG, and TIFF. Digital stamps offer many advantages over traditional rubber stamps because of their ability to be flipped, resized, rotated and easily stored.

In addition, digital stamps can be printed on a variety of papers and cardstocks, and when properly heat sealed can be used with a variety of coloring mediums including colored pencil, copic markers, even watercolors.

There are many digital stamping companies today.

A digital stamp, in mail or philately, is similar to a conventional postage stamp except it is resident on or in a computer. A digital stamp can typically be downloaded and printed onto envelopes or packages by authorized individuals.

Some artistamp-issuing entities have issued &quot;digital stamps&quot;, which have usually remained only pictures on a computer.

A digital stamp can also be an encoded way of &quot;approving&quot; or &quot;remarking on&quot; a digital copy of a document. Paper/hard copies of documents continue to be popular because they can be signed/initialed/remarked on in a manner that is unique and traceable to the reviewer. A digital stamp seeks to duplicate or replace this and enable a paperless exchange of information that still manages to have a verifiable comment and review.

<doc id="530981" wikidata="Q2870954" url="?curid=530981" title="Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover">
<text>Augusta Hall, Baroness Llanover (21 March 1802 – 17 January 1896), born Augusta Waddington, was a Welsh heiress, best known as a patron of the Welsh arts.

==Early life==
She was born on 12 March 1802, near Abergavenny, the youngest daughter of Benjamin Waddington of Ty Uchaf, Llanover and his wife, Georgina Port. She was the heiress to the Llanover estate in Monmouthshire, where she and her sisters were raised and educated by their mother.

==Marriage==
In 1823, Augusta became the wife of Benjamin Hall, later Baron Llanover (1802–1867). Their marriage joined the large South Wales estates of Llanover and Abercarn.

Benjamin Hall was for some years Member of Parliament for Monmouth, but transferred to a London seat just prior to the Newport Rising, which brought with it a turbulent time in Monmouthshire. He was created a baronet in 1838, and entered the House of Lords in 1859 under Prime Minister Palmerston as Baron Llanover. &quot;Big Ben&quot; at the Palace of Westminster, is said to have been named after him, as he was Commissioner of Works in 1855 when it was built.

==Llanover House==

In 1828, the couple commissioned Thomas Hopper to build Llanover House for them, in Monmouthshire. It was designed as a kind of arts centre as well as a family home.

Lady Llanover had always been interested in Celtic Studies. Her eldest sister and co-heiress, Frances, had married the diplomat Baron Bunsen, (later German ambassador to Great Britain) in 1817, following the Waddington family&#x27;s visit to Rome in the winter of 1816. The couple&#x27;s homes in Rome and London were cultural hubs and their social circle was also interested in Celtic subjects and culture.

Lady Llanover was greatly influenced by the local bard, Thomas Price, whom she met at a local Eisteddfod in 1826. Carnhuanawc taught her the Welsh language; she took the bardic name &quot;Gwenynen Gwent&quot;, (&#x27;the bee of Gwent&#x27;). She became an early member of Cymreigyddion y Fenni. Her Welsh was never considered fluent but she was an extremely enthusiastic proponent of all things Welsh. She structured her household at Llanover Hall on what she considered to be Welsh traditions and gave all her staff Welsh titles and Welsh costume to wear.

Her husband shared her concern for the preservation of the heritage of Wales, and campaigned for the Welsh to be able to hear church services conducted in the Welsh language.

==&#x27;Welsh Costume&#x27;==

At the Cardiff Eisteddfod of 1834, she won first prize for her essay on &quot;The Advantages resulting from the Preservation of the Welsh language and National Costume of Wales&quot; which was published in Welsh and English in 1836. She probably commissioned a series of watercolours of Welsh costumes which illustrate costumes worn by women in south Wales and Cardiganshire, 13 of which were reproduced as hand-coloured prints soon after 1834 (but were not published with the essay). These were little more than fashion prints for herself and friends to create dresses for themselves and their servants to be worn on special occasions, especially fancy dress balls. Although she was keen to see the women of Wales dressed in home-spun Welsh wool rather than the light cheap cottons which were becoming popular by the 1830s, there is very little evidence to show that she had any influence on the wearing of Welsh costume other than by her servants, family and friends, and there is no firm evidence to suggest that she influenced what was later adopted as the national costume of Wales.
She did encourage the production of traditional stripes and checks in woollen cloth and offered prizes for good examples of these at Eisteddfodau, but there were few entrants, with the weaver of Gwenfrwd mill, on her own estate, taking many of the prizes.

==Other achievements==

In 1850, she helped found &quot;Y Gymraes&quot; (&quot;The Welshwoman&quot;), the first Welsh-language periodical for women. Her other interests included cookery (&quot;The First Principles of Good Cookery&quot; published in 1867) and folk music; she encouraged the production and use of the traditional Welsh triple harp, employing a resident harpist at Llanover Hall.

She was a patron of the Welsh Manuscripts Society, of the Welsh Collegiate Institution at Llandovery, funded the compilation of a Welsh dictionary by Daniel Silvan Evans. She bought Welsh manuscripts of Taliesin Williams, Taliesin ab Iolo and the collection of Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams) (now held in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff).

She collaborated with Welsh musicians such as Maria Jane Williams, a noted harpist, vocalist and guitar player and Henry Brinley Richards, a noted composer best known for writing &quot;God Bless the Prince of Wales&quot;, and herself produced a &quot;Collection of Welsh Airs&quot;.

In 1938 the Llanover Hall Arts Centre in Cardiff, Wales has carried her name.

==Temperance movement==
Another main interest of hers was the temperance movement to which end she closed all the public houses on her estate, sometimes opening a modest temperance inn in their place, such as &quot;Y Seren Gobaith&quot; (&#x27;the Star of Hope&#x27;) temperance inn, which replaced the Red Lion at Llanellen. She was an outspoken and lifelong critic of the evils of alcohol. Closely associated with her temperance work was religion in the form of militant Protestantism and she endowed two Calvinistic Methodist churches in the Abercarn area, with services conducted in the Welsh language, but a liturgy based on the Anglican &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;.

She outlived her husband by nearly thirty years, living well into her nineties. Only one of their daughters survived to adulthood; Augusta, who in 1846 married Arthur Jones (1818–1895) of Llanarth, of an old Roman Catholic family. Their eldest son, Ivor Herbert, 1st Baron Treowen, became a Liberal MP and a Major-General during the First World War.

<doc id="530985" wikidata="Q4888758" url="?curid=530985" title="Benjamin Hall (industrialist)">
<text>Benjamin Hall (29 September 1778 – 31 July 1817) was an industrialist, politician and prominent figure in South Wales.

== Background, education and connections ==
Benjamin Hall was born on 29 September 1778, the eldest son of the Reverend Benjamin Hall, chancellor of the Diocese of Llandaff, and Elizabeth. He was educated at Westminster School and received a Queens Scholarship to study at Christ Church, Oxford in 1794, from where he graduated with a BA in 1799 and MA in 1801. He had joined Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1798 and was called to the bar in 1801.

In December 1801, Hall married Charlotte, the daughter of ironmaster Richard Crawshay, in what historian P. A. Symonds calls an &quot;advantageous marriage&quot; - her dowry was £40,000. His father-in-law made him a partner in the Cyfarthfa Ironworks in 1803 and in 1808 passed the Abercarn estate to him. This munificence was followed in 1810 with a bequest from his father-in-law of a 37.5 per cent share in the ironworks, which covered a significant amount of land and houses as well as the mine and quarry workings.

== Member of Parliament ==

Hall was the first industrialist to win a Welsh county seat in Parliament. He served as MP for Totnes in Devon from 1806 to 1812 and, after losing that seat, for Westbury in Wiltshire from 1812. In 1814, he transferred his seat to Glamorganshire, Wales until his death. He ended his association with Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1816.

== Family and heir ==

Hall died on 31 July 1817 and a monument was erected in his memory at Llandaff Cathedral in his Glamorganshire constituency. He had bought Hensol Castle for £45,500 in 1815 to fulfil an election promise that he would own a residence in Glamorgan, some people having suggested that his personal loyalties lay with his business interests in neighbouring Monmouthshire. A year later, he sold his share in the ironworks to his brother-in-law, William Crawshay, for £90,000.

Hall and his wife had six sons and a daughter. One child was Benjamin Hall, 1st Baron Llanover, a civil engineer and politician who as Commissioner of Works was notable for the construction of the Clock Tower of the Palace of Westminster. Some hold that the bell is accordingly known as &quot;Big Ben&quot;. Benjamin Hall senior had been called &quot;Slender Ben&quot; on account of his build.

<doc id="530988" wikidata="Q7248471" url="?curid=530988" title="Programmed Airline Reservations System">
<text>Programmed Airline Reservations System (PARS) is an IBM proprietary large scale airline reservation application, a computer reservations system, executing under the control of IBM Airline Control Program (ACP) (and later its successor, Transaction Processing Facility (TPF)). Its international version was known as &quot;IPARS&quot;.

By the 1960s, with the American Airlines SABRE reservations system up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed Deltamatic for Delta Air Lines on the IBM 7074, and PANAMAC for Pan American World Airways using an IBM 7080. By 1967/8 IBM generalized its airline reservations work into the PARS system, which ran on the larger members of the IBM System/360 family and which could support the largest airlines&#x27; needs at that time (e.g. United Airlines ran about 3000 reservations terminals online in the 1972 timeframe). In the early 1970s IBM modified its PARS reservations system so it could accommodate the smaller regional airlines on smaller members of the 370 systems family. The high performance PARS operating system evolved from ACP (&quot;Airlines Control Program&quot;) to TPF (&quot;Transaction Processing Facility&quot;).

In the early days of automated reservations systems in the 1960s and 1970s the combination of ACP and PARS provided unprecedented scale and performance from an on-line real-time system, and for a considerable period ranked among the largest networks and systems of the era. In the early 1970s major US banks were developing major on-line teleprocessing applications systems and were in urgent need of ACP&#x27;s high performance capabilities. ACP was made available by IBM to the banking industry in the mid-1970s. This system was used by the great majority of large airlines in the US and internationally; and its smaller 1970&#x27;s version was used by many smaller regional airlines. PARS (and IPARS) was extremely successful, and it massively improved and revolutionized the efficiency of airlines passenger operations and their profitability.

Along with many other major and regional US airlines, the PARS system was later used by TWA and Northwest Airlines. In this context PARS was also used as a marketing name by TWA when selling their system to travel agencies.
Swiss International Air Lines and Brussels Airlines discontinued using PARS beginning of 2016. IranAir, the Iranian National Airline, discontinued using IBM-ACP/IPARS at the beginning of 2000 due to Year 2000 (Y2K) problem.

CPARS (Compact Programmed Airlines Reservations) was used by smaller airlines (e.g. Icelandair). Among other limitations (compared to PARS) was a shorter booking horizon of 90 days.

<doc id="530997" wikidata="Q229207" url="?curid=530997" title="Amanda Tapping">
<text>Amanda Tapping (born 28 August 1965) is a British-Canadian actress and director. She is best known for portraying Samantha Carter in the Canadian–American military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1,&quot; &quot;Stargate Atlantis,&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe.&quot; She also starred as Helen Magnus in the science fiction-fantasy television series &quot;Sanctuary&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born in Rochford, Essex, England, Tapping moved with her family to Ontario, Canada, when she was one year old. She attended North Toronto Collegiate Institute, where she excelled in environmental science and drama. However, when she finished in 1984, she decided to focus her attention on drama, attending the University of Windsor School of Dramatic Arts in Windsor, Ontario.
== Career ==

After graduation, Tapping continued to study theatrical arts while performing in several stage productions. She appeared in several television commercials and played a variety of roles in television and film productions, such as &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;. She also formed a comedy troupe, the &quot;Random Acts&quot;, with collaborators Katherine Jackson and Anne Marie Kerr, in Toronto in the early 1990s.

Tapping is best known for her portrayal of Samantha Carter in the science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, which debuted in 1997. After &quot;SG-1&quot; aired its final episode, Tapping reprised the role of Samantha Carter on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; as the new commander of the Atlantis expedition. In season 5, however, Tapping&#x27;s role on the show was reduced to that of &quot;special guest-star&quot; with only occasional appearances because she chose to focus her attention on the development of a new series for Syfy called &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. The show expanded on an original series of eight webisodes released on the internet in 2007. The bulk of the scenery and characters were entirely green screen and CGI creations. Tapping served as both star and executive producer of the show.

In 2007, she won a Canadian Comedy Award for Best Actress for her role in the short film &quot;Breakdown&quot;.

On 18 September 2012, she was cast as an angel named Naomi on season 8 of the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;. She was a recurring character who appeared in seven episodes. She reprised the role in season 13&#x27;s &quot;Funeralia&quot;, nearly five years after the character&#x27;s apparent death.

She was also named as ACTRA&#x27;s 2015 Woman of the Year.

=== Directing ===
Tapping&#x27;s directing debut was during the seventh season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; on an episode titled &quot;Resurrection&quot;, written by co-star Michael Shanks. She also directed the &quot;Sanctuary&quot; season two episode &quot;Veritas&quot;. She has directed three episodes of &quot;&quot;, three episodes (2.12; 3.06; 3.07) of &quot;Continuum&quot;, and four episodes of &quot;Olympus&quot; and more recently episodes of &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, &quot;Van Helsing&quot;, &quot;The Magicians,&quot; and &quot;Supernatural,&quot; as well as the historical drama &quot;X Company.&quot; She also directed five episodes of the Netflix series &quot;Travelers&quot; and the season finale of the 2017 series &quot;Anne with an E&quot;. In 2022, Tapping also directed two episodes of the television series &quot;&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Tapping is married to Allan Kovacs and they live together in Vancouver, British Columbia. Tapping has one daughter with Kovacs. Tapping has openly shared the difficult experiences she has undergone through eight miscarriages during her marriage in hope that her story would help other miscarrying women feel less isolated.

Tapping has two living brothers, Richard and Christopher. A third brother Steven, who suffered from epilepsy and often uncontrollable seizures, died in December 2006 of causes unreleased by the Tapping family.

<text>Karl Buechner (born December 23, 1970) is an American musician from Syracuse, New York, best known as the frontman for the hardcore band Earth Crisis. He is also the singer of Freya, Path of Resistance, Vehement Serenade, Apocalypse Tribe and 1000 Drops of Venom.

In the mid- to late 1990s, Buechner attained a great popularity within the hardcore music scene as the frontman of Earth Crisis due to their outspoken advocacy for the straight edge and vegan lifestyles. He has been featured and interviewed by CNN, CBS, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and Fox News, and addressed the Congress about teens and substance abuse.

== Early life ==
Buechner was born on December 23, 1970 in Syracuse, New York. He has German and Irish roots. In his early teens, Buechner got into punk rock through his cousin and skateboarding, becoming a fan of bands such as the Dead Kennedys and Subhumans, as well as having traveled to other cities to participate in skate competitions. Around the age of fifteen, he saw the Cro-Mags&#x27; video &quot;We Gotta Know&quot; that &quot;was the spark that set off&quot; his love for hardcore punk music and, years later, he would describe &quot;The Age of Quarrel&quot; as &quot;still the greatest hardcore album of all time&quot;. During that time, Syracuse was going through a lingering recession where crime and illegal drug trade began to proliferate. Many of Buechner&#x27; skater friends started using drugs and alcohol, one of whom died while others were progressively affected, which motivated him to become straight edge. His and other Earth Crisis members&#x27; families also suffered from tragedies and random acts of violence at the time, including robberies. According to Buechner: &quot;to an extent we were kind of the products of [those] experience[s], but we didn&#x27;t join with it, we rebelled against it.&quot;

Most of Buechner&#x27;s family is vegetarian. He became a pescetarian at the age of sixteen after his sister handed him a PETA magazine with photographs of caged animals in a slaughterhouse. At eighteen, he transitioned into vegetarianism and shortly afterwards veganism, getting into animal liberation issues through conversations with his grandmother.&lt;ref name=&quot;syracuse 7/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first vocalist of Earth Crisis, DJ Rose, states that he and Buechner traveled to Albany where they met Dave Stein and Steve Reddy, who also taught them about animal rights before they established the group in 1989. Subsequently, Buechner became a volunteer at the Syracuse Wildlife Rehabilitation Center where he witnessed animals that were doused with gasoline and tortured in different ways, leaving &quot;quite an impression on&quot; him and which he attributes to the anger expressed in their early records.

Buechner graduated from Henninger High School in 1989. He attended college to become a history teacher with the intention of supporting a career in music or sports, but left it after two years when Earth Crisis was signed by Victory Records.

==Career==
Karl Buechner started playing bass and formed his first band, Mainforce Patrol, at the age of sixteen. In 1989, he became a member of Earth Crisis but their initial lineup was short-lived. He kept the idea of the group alive and continued writing songs, restarting them in 1991 as the new vocalist and releasing five further albums. In 1995, their drummer Dennis Merrick was seriously injured and, as he recuperated, the rest of the group formed the hardcore-oriented band Path of Resistance, releasing their album &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; in 1996. Earth Crisis disbanded in 2001 and reformed in 2007, releasing three more albums so far.

In early 2001, he began singing for Freya (formatively titled Nemesis and End Begins after EC songs) with two members of Earth Crisis plus two other members. They were named for the Norse goddess of fertility and their lyrics took inspiration from history, mythology and more personal issues, without addressing veganism or straight edge directly because not all members follow the lifestyles. They have released five studio albums so far.

In late 2005, Buechner joined Canadian band A Perfect Murder for a tour, replacing vocalist Kevin Randel.

Since 2008, he is the frontman of the supergroup Vehement Serenade along with Mike Couls (Cro-Mags, Skarhead, Cold as Life), Jamin Hunt (Sworn Enemy), Eddie Ortiz (Subzero) and Pauly Antignani (Sworn Enemy). In 2013, they released their debut album &quot;The Things That Tear You Apart&quot;.

In 2016, he formed the metalcore band 1000 Drops of Venom. Since 2017, he is also the frontman of Apocalypse Tribe and they released a split album with Rob Aston&#x27;s Death March on August 25.

==Influence==
Karl Buechner has been cited as an influence by artists such as Jamey Jasta of Hatebreed, Greg Bennick of Trial and Sean Ingram of Coalesce.

<doc id="531014" wikidata="Q337120" url="?curid=531014" title="Neutralization (chemistry)">
<text>In chemistry, neutralization or neutralisation (see spelling differences) is a chemical reaction in which acid and a base react with an equivalent quantity of each other. In a reaction in water, neutralization results in there being no excess of hydrogen or hydroxide ions present in the solution. The pH of the neutralized solution depends on the acid strength of the reactants.

== Meaning of &quot;neutralization&quot; ==

In the context of a chemical reaction the term neutralization is used for a reaction between an acid and a base or alkali. Historically, this reaction was represented as

:acid + base (alkali) → salt + water

For example:

:HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O

The statement is still valid as long as it is understood that in an aqueous solution the substances involved are subject to dissociation, which changes the ionization state of the substances. The arrow sign, →, is used because the reaction is complete, that is, neutralization is a quantitative reaction. A more general definition is based on Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory.

:AH + B → A + BH

Electrical charges are omitted from generic expressions such as this, as each species A, AH, B, or BH may or may not carry an electrical charge. Neutralization of sulfuric acid provides a specific example. Two partial neutralization reactions are possible in this instance.
:H2SO4 + OH− → + H2O 
: + OH− → + H2O
: Overall: H2SO4 + 2 OH− → + 2 H2O
After an acid AH has been neutralized there are no molecules of the acid (or hydrogen ions produced by dissociation of the molecule) left in solution.

When an acid is neutralized the amount of base added to it must be equal to the amount of acid present initially. This amount of base is said to be the equivalent amount. In a titration of an acid with a base, the point of neutralization can also be called the equivalence point. The quantitative nature of the neutralization reaction is most conveniently expressed in terms of the concentrations of acid and alkali. At the equivalence point:

:volume (acid) × concentration (H+ ions from dissociation) = volume (base) × concentration (OH− ions)

In general, for an acid AH&quot;n&quot; at concentration &quot;c&quot;1 reacting with a base B(OH)&quot;m&quot; at concentration &quot;c&quot;2 the volumes are related by:

: &quot;n&quot; &quot;v&quot;1 &quot;c&quot;1 = &quot;m&quot; &quot;v&quot;2 &quot;c&quot;2
An example of a base being neutralized by an acid is as follows.
:Ba(OH)2 + 2 H+ → Ba2+ + 2 H2O
The same equation relating the concentrations of acid and base applies. The concept of neutralization is not limited to reactions in solution. For example, the reaction of limestone with acid such as sulfuric acid is also a neutralization reaction.
:[Ca,Mg]CO3 + H2SO4 → (Ca2+, Mg2+) + + CO2 + H2O
Such reactions are important in soil chemistry.

== Strong acids and strong bases ==
A strong acid is one that is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For example, hydrochloric acid, HCl, is a strong acid.
:HCl → H+ + Cl−
A strong base is one that is fully dissociated in aqueous solution. For example, sodium hydroxide, NaOH, is a strong base.
:NaOH → Na+ + OH−
Therefore, when a strong acid reacts with a strong base the neutralization reaction can be written as 
:H+ + OH− → H2O
For example, in the reaction between hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide the sodium and chloride ions, Na+ and Cl− take no part in the reaction. The reaction is consistent with the Brønsted–Lowry definition because in reality the hydrogen ion exists as the hydronium ion, so that the neutralization reaction may be written as
:H3O+ + OH− → H2O + H2O
When a strong acid is neutralized by a strong base there are no excess hydrogen ions left in the solution. The solution is said to be neutral as it is neither acidic nor alkaline. The pH of such a solution is close to a value of 7; the exact pH value is dependent on the temperature of the solution.

Neutralization is an exothermic reaction. The standard enthalpy change for the reaction is −57.30 kJ/mol.

===Quantitative treatment===
The term &quot;fully dissociated&quot; is applied to a solute when the concentration of undissociated solute is below the detection limits, that is, when the undissociated solute&#x27;s concentration is too low to measured. Quantitatively, this is expressed as , or in some texts . This means that the value of the dissociation constant cannot be obtained from experimental measurements. The value can, however, be estimated theoretically. For example the value of has been estimated for hydrogen chloride in aqueous solution at room temperature. A chemical compound may behave as a strong acid in solution when its concentration is low and as a weak acid when its concentration is very high. Sulfuric acid is an example of such a compound.

== Weak acids and strong bases ==
A weak acid HA is one that does not dissociate fully when it is dissolved in water. Instead an equilibrium mixture is formed:
:HA + H2O H3O+ + A−
Acetic acid is an example of a weak acid. The pH of the neutralized solution resulting from
:HA + OH− → H2O + A− 
is not close to 7, as with a strong acid, but depends on the acid dissociation constant, &quot;K&quot;a, of the acid. The pH at the end-point or equivalence point in a titration may be calculated as follows. At the end-point the acid is completely neutralized so the analytical hydrogen ion concentration, &quot;T&quot;H, is zero and the concentration of the conjugate base, A−, is equal to the analytical or formal concentration &quot;T&quot;A of the acid: [A−] = &quot;T&quot;A. When a solution of an acid, HA, is at equilibrium, by definition the concentrations are related by the expression

:[A−][H+] = &quot;K&quot;a [HA];p&quot;K&quot;a = −log &quot;K&quot;a

The solvent (e.g. water) is omitted from the defining expression on the assumption that its concentration is very much greater than the concentration of dissolved acid, [H2O] ≫ &quot;T&quot;A. The equation for mass-balance in hydrogen ions can then be written as

:&quot;T&quot;H = [H+] + [A−][H+]/&quot;K&quot;a − 
where &quot;K&quot;w represents the self-dissociation constant of water. Since &quot;K&quot;w = [H+][OH−], the term is equal to [OH−], the concentration of hydroxide ions. At neutralization, &quot;T&quot;H is zero. After multiplying both sides of the equation by [H+], it becomes
:[H+]2 + &quot;T&quot;A[H+]2/&quot;K&quot;a − &quot;K&quot;w = 0
and, after rearrangement and taking logarithms,

:pH = p&quot;K&quot;w + log (1 + )

With a dilute solution of the weak acid, the term 1 + is equal to to a good approximation. If p&quot;K&quot;w = 14,

:pH = 7 + (p&quot;K&quot;a + log &quot;T&quot;A)/2

This equation explains the following facts:
*The pH at the end-point depends mainly on the strength of the acid, p&quot;K&quot;a.
*The pH at the end-point is greater than 7 and increases with increasing concentration of the acid, &quot;T&quot;A, as seen in the figure.
In a titration of a weak acid with a strong base the pH rises more steeply as the end-point is approached. At the end-point, the slope of the curve of pH with respect to amount of titrant is a maximum. Since the end-point occurs at pH greater than 7, the most suitable indicator to use is one, like phenolphthalein, that changes color at high pH.

== Weak bases and strong acids ==
The situation is analogous to that of weak acids and strong bases.
:B + H3O+ BH+ + H2O 
Amines are examples of weak bases. The pH of the neutralized solution depends on the acid dissociation constant of the protonated base, p&quot;K&quot;a, or, equivalently, on the base association constant, p&quot;K&quot;b. The most suitable indicator to use for this type of titration is one, such as methyl orange, that changes color at low pH.

== Weak acids and weak bases ==
When a weak acid reacts with an equivalent amount of a weak base, 
:HA + B A− + BH+
complete neutralization does not always occur. The concentrations of the species in equilibrium with each other will depend on the equilibrium constant, &quot;K&quot;, for the reaction, which is defined as follows:
:[A−][BH+] = &quot;K&quot; [HA][B].
The neutralization reaction can be considered as the difference of the following two acid dissociation reactions
:HA H+ + A− &quot;K&quot;a,A = [A−][H+]/[HA]
:BH+ B + H+ &quot;K&quot;a,B = [B][H+]/[BH+] 
with the dissociation constants &quot;K&quot;a,A and &quot;K&quot;a,B of the acids HA and BH+, respectively. Inspection of the reaction quotients shows that

:&quot;K&quot; = .

A weak acid cannot always be neutralized by a weak base, and vice versa. However, for the neutralization of benzoic acid (&quot;K&quot;a,A = 6.5 × 10−5) with ammonia (&quot;K&quot;a,B = 5.6 × 10−10 for ammonium), &quot;K&quot; = 1.2 × 105 » 1, and more than 99% of the benzoic acid is converted to benzoate.

== Applications ==
Chemical titration methods are used for analyzing acids or bases to determine the unknown concentration. Either a pH meter or a pH indicator which shows the point of neutralization by a distinct color change can be employed. Simple stoichiometric calculations with the known volume of the unknown and the known volume and molarity of the added chemical gives the molarity of the unknown.

In wastewater treatment, chemical neutralization methods are often applied to reduce the damage that an effluent may cause upon release to the environment. For pH control, popular chemicals include calcium carbonate, calcium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, and sodium bicarbonate. The selection of an appropriate neutralization chemical depends on the particular application.

There are many uses of neutralization reactions that are acid-alkali reactions. A very common use is antacid tablets. These are designed to neutralize excess gastric acid in the stomach (HCl) that may be causing discomfort in the stomach or lower esophagus. This can also be remedied by the ingestion of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). Sodium bicarbonate is also commonly used to neutralise acid spills in laboratories, as well as acid burns.

In chemical synthesis of nanomaterials, the heat of neutralization reaction can be used to facilitate the chemical reduction of metal precursors.

Also in the digestive tract, neutralization reactions are used when food is moved from the stomach to the intestines. In order for the nutrients to be absorbed through the intestinal wall, an alkaline environment is needed, so the pancreas produce an antacid bicarbonate to cause this transformation to occur.

Another common use, though perhaps not as widely known, is in fertilizers and control of soil pH. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) or limestone (calcium carbonate) may be worked into soil that is too acidic for plant growth. Fertilizers that improve plant growth are made by neutralizing sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or nitric acid (HNO3) with ammonia gas (NH3), making ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate. These are salts utilized in the fertilizer.

Industrially, a by-product of the burning of coal, sulfur dioxide gas, may combine with water vapor in the air to eventually produce sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain. To prevent the sulfur dioxide from being released, a device known as a scrubber gleans the gas from smoke stacks. This device first blows calcium carbonate into the combustion chamber where it decomposes into calcium oxide (lime) and carbon dioxide. This lime then reacts with the sulfur dioxide produced forming calcium sulfite. A suspension of lime is then injected into the mixture to produce a slurry, which removes the calcium sulfite and any remaining unreacted sulfur dioxide.

In the final manufacturing quality control process products often undergo acid treatment &amp; the acid treatments have to be neutralized to prevent corrosion of the product.

<doc id="531017" wikidata="Q1455520" url="?curid=531017" title="Groom (profession)">
<text>A groom or stable boy (stable hand, stable lad) is a person who is responsible for some or all aspects of the management of horses and/or the care of the stables themselves. The term most often refers to a person who is the employee of a stable owner, but an owner of a horse may perform the duties of a groom, particularly if the owner only possesses a few horses.

==Etymology==
The word appeared in English as grome c.1225, meaning &quot;boy child, boy, youth&quot;. Its origin is unknown; it has no known cognates in other Germanic languages (e.g. Dutch and German use compound terms, such as &quot;Stal(l)knecht&quot; &#x27;stable servant&#x27;, or equivalents of synonyms mentioned below). Perhaps, it stems from an Old English root &quot;groma&quot;, related to &quot;growan&quot; &quot;grow&quot; or from Old French &quot;grommet&quot; &quot;servant&quot; (compare Medieval English gromet for &quot;ship&#x27;s boy&quot;, recorded since 1229).
The word was originally rather grander in status, as in bridegroom and the socially-elevated offices in the English Royal Household of:
* Groom of the Chamber, or of the Privy Chamber, 
* Groom of the Robes, 
* Groom of the Stool

The meaning &quot;man servant who attends to horses&quot; is from 1667 although women and girls are often grooms. The verb is first attested in 1809; the transferred sense of &quot;to tidy (oneself) up&quot; is from 1843; and the figurative sense of &quot;to prepare a candidate&quot; is from 1887, originally in U.S. politics.

==Job==

Grooms may be employed in private residences or in professional horse training facilities such as stables, agistment properties and riding academies.

The groom(s) usually clean stables (mucking-out), feed, exercise and groom horses.

A groom in private service is expected to be &#x27;on call&#x27; during specified hours in case any member of the employer&#x27;s family wishes to ride.

Grooms whose employers are involved in horse sports or horse racing are often required to travel with their employers to provide support services during competitions. The services required vary with the type of competition and range from simply ensuring that the horse is ready for the start of the competition to warming the horse up beforehand.

In competition, the term may have a distinct meaning. At a horse show, grooms outside of the ring perform standard grooming tasks, but if utilized inside the show ring are generally defined as an individual called in to assist an exhibitor with a horse while in competition. In combined driving the groom is the passenger and at speed is required to shift his weight to balance the carriage.

==Ranks, synonyms and terminology==

Stablehand is a more old-fashioned term; the variation stableman usually applies to an experienced adult, the lowest rank stableboy (corresponding to the first origin of groom) rather to a minor and/or trainee.

The historical synonym [h]ostler has meanwhile developed (in the United States) a new meaning of &quot;rail employee&quot;.

Large establishments may employ several grooms under the management of the head groom or stablemaster. In many cases the head groom has complete responsibility for the horses including devising training schedules, choosing feeds for optimum nutrition and ensuring the horses are shod, wormed, inoculated and provided with timely veterinary care.

Several other words originally denoting other (often much higher) titles, notably Constable, Equerry and Marshal, have developed into terms for those working with horses.

In African or Asian contexts, English-speakers sometimes use the Arabic/Hindustani word &quot;sais&quot; or &quot;syce&quot; instead of &quot;groom&quot;.

<text>Russell Square is a large garden square in Bloomsbury, in the London Borough of Camden, built predominantly by the firm of James Burton. It is near the University of London&#x27;s main buildings and the British Museum. Almost exactly square, to the north is Woburn Place and to the south-east is Southampton Row. Russell Square tube station sits to the north-east.

It is named after the surname of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford; the freehold remains with the latter&#x27;s conservation trusts who have agreed public access and management by Camden Council. The gardens are in the mainstream, initial category (of Grade II listing) on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

== History ==
Following the demolition of Bedford House, Russell Square and Bedford Square were laid out in 1804. The square is named after the surname of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford, who developed the family&#x27;s London landholdings in the 17th and 18th centuries. Between 1805 and 1830, Thomas Lawrence had a studio at number 65. Other past residents include the famous 19th-century architectural father-and-son partnership, Philip and Philip Charles Hardwick, who lived at number 60 in the 1850s.

On the eastern side the Hotel Russell, built in 1898 to a design by Charles Fitzroy Doll, dominates (its builders were connected with the company which created RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;), alongside the Imperial Hotel, which was also designed by Charles Fitzroy Doll and built from 1905 to 1911. The old Imperial building was demolished in 1967.

The square contained large terraced houses aimed mainly at upper-middle-class families. A number of the original houses survive, especially on the southern and western sides. Those to the west are occupied by the University of London, and there is a blue plaque on one at the north-west corner commemorating the fact that T. S. Eliot worked there from the late 1920s when he was poetry editor of Faber &amp; Faber. That building is now used by the School of Oriental and African Studies (a college of the University of London).

In 1998, the London Mathematical Society moved from rooms in Burlington House to De Morgan House, at 57–58 Russell Square, in order to accommodate staff expansion.

The Cabmen&#x27;s Shelter Fund was established in London in 1875 to run shelters for the drivers of hansom cabs and later hackney carriages (and taxicabs).

In 2002, the square was re-landscaped in a style based on the original early 19th century layout by Humphry Repton (1752–1818).

Since 2004, the two buildings on the southern side, at numbers 46 and 47, have been occupied by the Huron University USA in London (now the London campus for EF International Language Centres and is the Centre for Professional Students over the age of 25).

On 7 July 2005, two terrorist bombings occurred near the square. One of them was on a London Underground train at that moment running between King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station and Russell Square tube station, and another was on a bus on Tavistock Square, near Russell Square. To commemorate the victims, many flowers were laid at a spot on Russell Square just south of the café. The location is now marked by a memorial plaque and a young oak tree.

The square was also the site of a mass stabbing in 2016.

The London Branch of École Jeannine Manuel has occupied 52–53 Russell Square since 2019.

== Literature and culture ==
===Literature===
Russell Square appears in various novels. In the early chapters of Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1848), set in about 1812, Russell Square is evoked as the residence of &quot;John Sedley, Esquire, of Russell Square, and the Stock Exchange.&quot; Virginia Woolf set many scenes of her novel &quot;Night and Day&quot; (1919) in Russell Square.

Jenny Chawleigh, daughter of business man Jonathan Chawleigh, lives with her father in Russell Square before she marries the protagonist, Captain Adam Deveril (Viscount Lynton), in Georgette Heyer&#x27;s Regency romance novel &quot;A Civil Contract&quot;, published in 1961. They converse about the history of the Square on Lord Lynton&#x27;s first visit to the house, and Mr. Chawleigh is not impressed with the statue of the Duke of Bedford.

21 Russell Square is the murderer&#x27;s street address in the novel (but not in the movie adaptation) &quot;The Murderer Lives at Number 21&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Assassin habite au 21&quot;) by the Belgian writer Stanislas-André Steeman. In John Dickson Carr&#x27;s detective novel &quot;The Hollow Man&quot;, the victim, Professor Grimaud, lives in a house on the western side of Russell Square. In Alan Hollinghurst&#x27;s novel &quot;The Swimming Pool Library&quot; (1988), the protagonist William Beckwith spends time here with his lover who works in a hotel overlooking the square.

In chapter 6 (&quot;Rendezvous&quot;) of John Wyndham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1951) the main characters William (Bill) Masen and Josella Playton are photographed by Elspeth Cary in Russell Square while practicing with triffid guns. In Ben Aaronovitch’s Peter Grant books, the first of which is &quot;The Rivers of London&quot; (also known as &quot;Midnight Riot&quot;), The Folly – headquarters of British wizardry – is located in Russell Square.

===Television===
Russell Square is the location of the eponymous bookshop in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Black Books&quot;. In the BBC&#x27;s 2010 &#x27;Sherlock&#x27; episode entitled &quot;A Study in Pink&quot;, Russell Square is the park in which the character of Dr Watson (Freeman) was re-acquainted with his previous classmate Mike Stamford (Nellist). The Imperial Hotel façade that lines Russell Square served as a backdrop for the park-bench conversation between Watson and Stamford. (It is Stamford who subsequently introduces Dr Watson to Sherlock Holmes.)

<text>SabreTalk is a discontinued dialect of PL/I for the S/360 IBM mainframes running the TPF platform. SabreTalk was developed jointly by American Airlines, Eastern Air Lines and IBM. SabreTalk is known as PL/TPF (Programming Language for TPF).

In 1973, Eastern Air Lines&#x27; computing division was selling the SabreTalk compiler for US$95,000.

SabreTalk programs still run in the British Airways Flight Operations system (FICO) under ALCS, using a commercially available automatic converter to translate SabreTalk programs to C programs. Both the Reservations and Operations Support System (OSS) of Delta Air Lines were developed using both SabreTalk and IBM 360 Assembler. Although development is currently restricted to C++, the majority of Delta&#x27;s programming platform remained in Sabretalk until recently in the 2010s.

Because of the availability of translators 
from SabreTalk to C and discontinued support by the original developers, several companies are beginning the move away from SabreTalk to purely C-based programs.

<text>Herri Batasuna (; ; HB) was a far-left Basque nationalist coalition in Spain. It was founded in 1978 and defined itself as abertzale, left-wing, socialist, and supported the independence of the Greater Basque Country. It was refounded as Batasuna in 2001 and subsequently outlawed by the Spanish Supreme Court for being considered the political wing of the separatist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA).

==History==
The party was founded in April 1978 as Herri Batasuna, a coalition of leftist nationalist political groups initially brought together to advocate for &quot;No&quot; in the referendum to be held that year on the Spanish constitution.

Its constituent parties had been called together by senior Basque nationalist Telesforo de Monzón in a 1978 meeting called &quot;The table of Alsasua&quot;. Herri Batasuna&#x27;s founding convention was held in Lekeitio, home of Santiago Brouard, who was then the leader of HASI (Herriko Alderdi Sozialista Iraultzailea or Revolutionary Socialist People&#x27;s Party). The party won 150,000 votes in the Basque Country (15%) and 22,000 additional votes in Navarre (9%) in its first Spanish general election in March 1979. Thus, they won three seats in the Spanish Parliament, which they did not occupy. The same happened in 1980 in the first elections to the Basque Parliament, in which HB stood as a second political force, with 151,636 votes (16.55%), winning 11 seats. Its absence allowed a BNP-only Basque government led by Carlos Garaikoetxea. On 20 November 1984, Brouard was assassinated by two members of the GAL. The killing is perhaps the only one performed by the GAL death squad within Spain itself.

Another well-known Herri Batasuna leader, Josu Muguruza, was also killed by members of the neo-fascist Bases Autónomas in 1989, while he was in a hotel in Madrid. He was a congressman in the Spanish Parliament when he was assassinated.

==Electoral performance==
Since its foundation, Herri Batasuna ran for every election in the Basque Country and in Navarre, as well as in Spanish general elections (from 1979 to 1996) and the European elections of 1987, 1989 and 1994. In the 2000 Spanish general election, it supported abstention. In the elections held from 1998 to 2001, it was part of the coalition Euskal Herritarrok.

Herri Batasuna refused to participate in many of the institutions where it won seats, with the exception of local town halls.

<text>The Hanko Peninsula (; ) is the southernmost point of mainland Finland. The soil is a sandy moraine, the last tip of the Salpausselkä ridge, and vegetation consists mainly of pine and low shrubs. The peninsula is known for its beautiful archipelago and long sandy beaches.

The town of Hanko is situated on the peninsula, as is the Port of Hanko.

The Baltic Sea proper is demarcated by a line from the Hanko Peninsula to the northwesternmost point of mainland Estonia. The waters east of this line are considered the Gulf of Finland.

The Hanko Peninsula has played a major part during times of war. The Battle of Gangut was fought outside the Hanko peninsula on 7 August 1714 (&quot;Gangut&quot; is the Russian transliteration of the Swedish name for the peninsula &quot;Hangö udd&quot;). Some of the Russian fortifications that were built as part of Peter the Great&#x27;s Naval Fortress are located here. During the Finnish Civil War, the German Ostsee Division landed here in April 1918.

Following the Winter War, the southern part of the peninsula with the town of Hanko was leased to the Soviet Union for 30 years, where the Hanko Naval Base was established. However, the Soviets evacuated their 25,000 soldiers in the area during the Continuation War and it was retaken by the Finns and the Swedish Volunteer Battalion in December 1941.

<text>The Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, also known as the Ringling Bros. Circus, Ringling Bros., the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, Barnum &amp; Bailey, or simply Ringling, is an American traveling circus company billed as The Greatest Show on Earth. It and its predecessor have run shows from 1871, with a hiatus from 2017 to 2023. They operate as Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey. The circus started in 1919 when the Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x27;s Greatest Show on Earth, a circus created by P. T. Barnum and James Anthony Bailey, was merged with the Ringling Bros. World&#x27;s Greatest Shows. The Ringling brothers purchased Barnum &amp; Bailey Ltd. in 1907 following Bailey&#x27;s death in 1906, but ran the circuses separately until they were merged in 1919.

After 1957, the circus no longer exhibited under its own portable &quot;big top&quot; tents, instead using permanent venues such as sports stadiums and arenas. In 1967, Irvin Feld and his brother Israel, along with Houston judge Roy Hofheinz, bought the circus from the Ringling family. In 1971, the Felds and Hofheinz sold the circus to Mattel, buying it back from the toy company in 1981. Since the death of Irvin Feld in 1984, the circus has continued to be a part of Feld Entertainment, an international entertainment firm headed by his son Kenneth Feld, with its headquarters in Ellenton, Florida.

In May 2017, with weakening attendance, many animal rights protests, and high operating costs, the circus performed its final animal show at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and closed indefinitely.

In September 2023, after a six-year hiatus, a relaunched animal-free circus returned with its first show in Bossier City, Louisiana. It did not include clowns or a ringmaster.

==History==
===Predecessor circuses===
Hachaliah Bailey appears to have established one of the earliest circuses in the United States after he purchased an African elephant, whom he named &quot;Old Bet&quot;, around 1806, just 13 years after John Bill Ricketts first brought the circus to the United States from Great Britain. P. T. Barnum, who as a boy had worked as a ticket seller for Hachaliah Bailey&#x27;s show, had run the Barnum&#x27;s American Museum from New York City since 1841 from the former Scudder&#x27;s American Museum building.

Besides building up the existing exhibits, Barnum brought in animals to add zoo-like elements, and a freak show. During this time, Barnum took the Museum on road tours, named &quot;P.T. Barnum&#x27;s Grand Traveling American Museum&quot;. The Museum burned down in July 1865. Though Barnum attempted to re-establish the Museum at another location in the city, it too burned down in 1868, and Barnum opted to retire from the museum business.
 
In 1871, Dan Castello and William Cameron Coup persuaded Barnum to come out of retirement to lend his name, know-how, and financial backing to the circus they had already created in Delavan, Wisconsin. The combined show was named &quot;P.T. Barnum&#x27;s Great Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan, and Hippodrome&quot;. As described by Barnum, Castello and Coup &quot;had a show that was truly immense, and combined all the elements of museum, menagerie, variety performance, concert hall, and circus&quot;, and considered it to potentially be &quot;the Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which subsequently became part of the circus&#x27;s name.

Independently of Castello and Coup, James Anthony Bailey had teamed up with James E. Cooper to create the Cooper and Bailey Circus in the 1860s. The Cooper and Bailey Circus became the chief competitor to Barnum&#x27;s circus. As Bailey&#x27;s circus was outperforming his, Barnum sought to merge the circuses. The two groups agreed to combine their shows on March 28, 1881. Initially named &quot;P.T. Barnum&#x27;s Greatest Show On Earth, And The Great London Circus, Sanger&#x27;s Royal British Menagerie and The Grand International Allied Shows United&quot;, it was eventually shortened to &quot;Barnum and Bailey&#x27;s Circus&quot;. Bailey was instrumental in acquiring Jumbo, advertised as the world&#x27;s largest elephant, for the show.

After Jumbo died, Barnum donated his taxidermied remains to Tufts University on whose Board of Trustees Barnum served as one of Tufts&#x27; first trustees. The Barnum Museum of Natural History opened in 1884 on the Tufts campus and Jumbo was a prominent part of the display. To this day the Tufts athletic mascot is Jumbo and its athletic teams are referred to as the &quot;Jumbos&quot;. Barnum died in 1891 and Bailey then purchased the circus from his widow. Bailey continued touring the Eastern United States until he took his circus to Europe. That tour started on December 27, 1897, and lasted until 1902.

Separately, in 1884, five of the seven Ringling brothers had started a small circus in Baraboo, Wisconsin. This was about the same time that Barnum &amp; Bailey were at the peak of their popularity. Similar to dozens of small circuses that toured the Midwestern United States and the Northeastern United States at the time, the brothers moved their circus from town to town in small animal-drawn caravans. Their circus rapidly grew and they were soon able to move their circus by train, which allowed them to have the largest traveling amusement enterprise of that time. Bailey&#x27;s European tour gave the Ringling brothers an opportunity to move their show from the Midwest to the eastern seaboard. Faced with the new competition, Bailey took his show west of the Rocky Mountains for the first time in 1905. He died the next year, and the circus was sold to the Ringling Brothers.

===Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus===
The Ringlings purchased the Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show on Earth in 1907 and ran the circuses separately until 1919. By that time, Charles Edward Ringling and John Nicholas Ringling were the only remaining brothers of the five who founded the circus. They decided that it was too difficult to run the two circuses independently because of labour shortages and complications to rail travel brought about by American involvement in World War I, and on March 29, 1919, &quot;Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows&quot; debuted in New York City. The posters declared, &quot;The Ringling Bros. World&#x27;s Greatest Shows and the Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show on Earth are now combined into one record-breaking giant of all exhibitions.&quot; Charles E. Ringling died in 1926, but the circus flourished through the Roaring Twenties.

John Ringling had the circus move its headquarters to Sarasota, Florida, in 1927.

In 1929, the American Circus Corporation signed a contract to perform in New York City. John Ringling purchased American Circus, the owner of five circuses, for $1.7 million.

In 1938, the circus made a lucrative offer to Frank Buck, a well-known adventurer and animal collector, to tour as their star attraction and to enter the show astride an elephant. He refused to join the American Federation of Actors, stating that he was &quot;a scientist, not an actor.&quot; Though there was a threat of a strike if he did not join the union, he maintained that he would not compromise his principles, saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m with the working man. I worked like a dog once myself. And my heart is with the fellow who works. But I don&#x27;t want some ... union delegate telling me when to get on and off an elephant.&quot; Eventually, the union gave Buck a special dispensation to introduce Gargantua the gorilla without registering as an actor.
The circus suffered during the 1930s due to the Great Depression, but managed to stay in business. After John Nicholas Ringling&#x27;s death, his nephew, John Ringling North, managed the indebted circus twice, the first from 1937 to 1943. Special dispensation was given to the circus by President Roosevelt to use the rails to operate in 1942, in spite of travel restrictions imposed as a result of World War II. Many of the most famous images from the circus that were published in magazine and posters were captured by American Photographer Maxwell Frederic Coplan, who traveled the world with the circus, capturing its beauty as well as its harsh realities.

North&#x27;s cousin Robert took over as president of the show in 1943 with North resuming the presidency of the circus in 1947.

===Hartford circus fire===

On July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, during an afternoon performance attended by some 8,000 people, the Big Top tent caught fire. At least 167 people were killed and many hundreds injured. Circus management was found to be negligent and several Ringling executives served sentences in jail. Ringling Brothers&#x27; management set aside all profits for the next ten years to pay the claims filed against the show by the City of Hartford and the survivors of the fire.

===Feld family===
The post-war prosperity enjoyed by the rest of the nation was not shared by the circus as crowds dwindled and costs increased. Public tastes, influenced by the movies and television, abandoned the circus, which gave its last performance under the big top in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 16, 1956. An article in &quot;Life&quot; magazine reported that &quot;a magical era had passed forever&quot;. In 1956, when John Ringling North and Arthur Concello moved the circus from a tent show to an indoor operation, Irvin Feld was one of several promoters hired to work the advance for select dates. Irvin Feld and his brother, Israel Feld, had already made a name for themselves marketing and promoting D.C. area rock and roll shows. In 1959, Ringling Bros. started wintering in Venice, Florida.

In late 1967, Irvin Feld, Israel Feld, and Judge Roy Mark Hofheinz of Texas, together with backing from Richard C. Blum, the founder of Blum Capital, bought the company outright from North and the Ringling family interests for $8 million at a ceremony at Rome&#x27;s Colosseum. Irving Feld immediately began making other changes to improve the quality and profitability of the show. Irvin got rid of the freak show so as not to capitalize on others&#x27; deformations and to become more family oriented. He got rid of the more routine acts.
In 1968, with the craft of clowning seemingly neglected and with many of the clowns in their 50s, he established the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College. Circus Williams, a circus in Europe was purchased for $2 million just to have its star animal trainer, Gunther Gebel-Williams, for the core of his revamped circus. Soon, he split the show into two touring units, Red and Blue, which could tour the country independently. The separate tours could also offer differing slates of acts and themes, enabling circus goers to view both tours where possible.. Also in 1968, Feld hired The King Charles Troupe, a unicycle club from The Bronx and the first ever African-American circus troupe, to perform unicycle basketball for 18 years with the circus. Performing unicyclists also included Ted Jorgensen.

The company was taken public in 1969. In 1970, Feld&#x27;s only son Kenneth joined the company and became a co-producer. The circus was sold to the Mattel company in 1971 for $40 million, with the Feld family retained as management.

After Walt Disney World opened near Orlando, Florida, in 1971, the circus attempted to cash in on the resulting tourism surge by opening Circus World theme park in nearby Haines City, which broke ground in April 1973. The theme park was expected to become the circus&#x27;s winter home as well as to have the Clown College located there. Mattel placed the circus corporation up for sale in December 1973 despite its profit contributions, as Mattel as a whole had a $29.9 million loss in 1972. The park&#x27;s opening was delayed until February 1974.

Venture Out in America, Inc., a Gulf Oil recreational subsidiary, bought the combined shows in January 1974, and the opening was further pushed back to 1975. While the Circus Showcase for Circus World opened on , Venture Out placed the purchase deal back into negotiations, and the opening of the complex was moved to early 1976.

By May 1980, the company expanded to three circuses by adding the one-ring International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo that debuted in Japan and Australia. The Felds bought the circus back in 1982 less Circus World. Irvin Feld died in 1984 and the company has since been run by Kenneth.

In 1990, the Seminole Gulf Railway, who took over the rail line serving the Venice facility in 1987, could no longer support the show&#x27;s train cars, which led the combined circus to move its winter base to the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. In 1993, the clown college was moved from the Venice Arena to Baraboo, Wisconsin. In 1995, the company founded the Center for Elephant Conservation (CEC).

Clair George has testified in court that he worked as a consultant in the early 1990s for Kenneth Feld and the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. He was involved in the surveillance of Janice Pottker, a journalist who was writing about the Feld family, and of various animal rights groups such as PETA.

After three years in Baraboo, the clown college operated at the Sarasota Opera House in Sarasota until 1998 before the program was suspended. In February 1999, the circus company started previewing Barnum&#x27;s Kaleidoscape, a one ring, intimate, upscale circus performed under the tent. Designed to compete with similar upscale circuses such as Cirque du Soleil, Barnum&#x27;s Kaleidoscape was not successful, and ceased performances after the end of 2000.

Nicole Feld became the first female producer of Ringling Circus in 2004. In 2009, Nicole and Alana Feld co-produced the circus.
In 2001, a group led by The Humane Society of the United States sued the circus over alleged mistreatment of elephants. The suit and a countersuit ended in 2014 with the circus winning a total of $25.2 million in settlements. In March 2015, the circus announced that all elephants would be retired in 2018 to the CEC, but Ringling accelerated the decision and retired the elephants in May 2016.

Eight months after it retired the elephants, it was announced in January 2017, that the circus would do 30 more performances, lay off more than 462 employees between March and May 2017 and then close. The circus cited steeply declining ticket sales associated with the loss of the elephants combined with high operating costs as reasons for the closure,
along with animal cruelty concerns. On May 7, 2017, its &quot;Circus Extreme&quot; tour was shown for the last time at the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. The circus&#x27;s last performance before the hiatus was its &quot;Out of This World&quot; tour at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on May 21, 2017.

===2023 relaunch===
In October 2021, Feld Entertainment Chairman and CEO Kenneth Feld and COO Juliette Feld Grossman announced that the circus would be relaunched in 2023, without animal performances.
In early 2022, the circus began auditioning artists for a retooled circus. More than 1,000 acts applied, and auditions were held in Paris, Las Vegas, Ethiopia, and Mongolia.

In May 2022, Feld Entertainment announced that the circus would resume operations in the fall of 2023 with a tour of 50 cities. The circus said the new show would debut as a &quot;multi-platform entertainment franchise&quot;.

On September 29, 2023, after a six-year hiatus, the relaunched circus kicked off at Brookshire Grocery Arena in Bossier City, Louisiana.

==Circus trains==

The circus maintained two circus train-based shows, one each on its Red Unit and Blue Unit trains. Each train was a mile long with roughly 60 cars: 36 passenger cars, 4 stock cars and 20 freight. Rolling stock belonging to the circus displayed the reporting mark &quot;RBBX&quot;. The Blue and Red Tours presented a full three-ring production for two years each, taking off the month of December, visiting alternating major cities each year.

Each train presented a different &quot;edition&quot; of the show, using a numbering scheme that dates back to circus origins in 1871the first year of P.T. Barnum&#x27;s show. The Blue Tour presented the even-numbered editions on a two-year tour, beginning each even-numbered year, and the Red Tour presented the odd-numbered editions on the same two-year tour, beginning each odd-numbered year.

In the 1950s, there was one gigantic train system comprising three separate train loads that brought the main show to the big cities. The first train load consisted of 22 cars and had the tents and the workers to set them up. The second section comprised 28 cars and carried the canvasmen, ushers and sideshow workers. The third section had 19 sleeping cars for the performers.

On January 13, 1994, eighteen cars of the circus train derailed while traveling between St. Petersburg and Orlando. Ringling estimated that 150 employees were on board at the time of the accident; fifteen received minor injuries, and clown Ceslee Conkling and elephant trainer Ted Svertesky were killed. The animals were not injured due to the nature of the derailment. The cars carrying the horses and elephants were at the front of the train because otherwise their weight could derail the train, and the other animals were carried at the back of the train. The NTSB&#x27;s report on the accident concluded that the train derailed due to a fatigue crack in one of the train&#x27;s wheels.

From 2003 to 2015, the circus also operated a truck-based Gold Tour presenting a scaled-back, single-ring version of the show designed to serve smaller markets deemed incapable of supporting the three-ring versions.

==Animal care and criticism==
Many animal rights groups have criticized the circus for their treatment of animals over the years, saying that using them to perform is cruel and unnecessary.

In 2004, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey were investigated following the death of a lion who died from heat and lack of water while the circus train was traveling through the Mojave Desert. In 1998, the United States Department of Agriculture filed charges against Ringling Bros. for forcing a sick elephant to perform. Ringling paid a $20,000 fine.

In 2000, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) and other animal groups sued the circus, alleging that it violated the Endangered Species Act by its treatment of Asian elephants in its circus. These allegations were based primarily on the testimony of a circus barn worker. After years of litigation and a six-week non-jury trial, the Court dismissed the suit in a written decision in 2009, finding that the barn worker did not have standing to file suit. (ASPCA v. Feld Entm’t, Inc., 677 F. Supp. 2d 55 (D.D.C. 2009)).

Meanwhile, the circus learned during the trial that the animal rights groups had paid the barn worker $190,000 to be a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The circus then sued the animal rights groups under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 2007, accusing the groups of conspiracy to harm its business and other illegal acts. In December 2012, the ASPCA agreed to pay the circus $9.2 million to settle its part of the lawsuit. The 14-year course of litigation came to an end in May 2014 when The Humane Society of the United States and a number of other animal rights groups paid a $16 million settlement to the circus&#x27; parent company, Feld Entertainment.

From 2007 to 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture conducted inspections of the circus&#x27;s animals, facilities, and records, finding non-compliance with the agency&#x27;s regulations. The allegations, as brought forth by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) included videotapes of the head elephant trainer and the animal superintendent backstage repeatedly hitting elephants with bullhooks just before the animals would enter the arena for performances. A tiger trainer was videotaped beating tigers during dress rehearsals.

An inspection report alleged that a female Asian elephant, Banko, was forced to perform at a show in Los Angeles despite a diagnosis of sand colic and observations that she appeared to be suffering abdominal discomfort. The inspection reports also cited splintered floors and rusted cages. Following these inspections and complaints filed with the USDA by PETA, the company agreed to pay a $270,000 fine, the largest civil penalty ever assessed against an animal exhibitor under the Animal Welfare Act.

In March 2015, Feld Entertainment announced it would stop using elephants in its shows by 2018, stating that the 13 elephants that were part of its shows would be sent to the circus&#x27;s Center for Elephant Conservation, which at that time housed over 40 elephants. Feld stated that this action was not a result of the allegations by animal rights groups, but rather due to the patchwork of local laws regarding whether elephants could be used in entertainment shows. Some of those local laws referred to were bans against the use of bullhooks. Subsequently, the retirement was moved up to 2016.

Seven tigers, six lions and one leopard were part of a convoy to temporarily move the animals out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma on September 5, 2017. One of them, a 6-year-old Siberian tiger named Suzy who had previously starred in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, escaped from a convoy of trucks transporting her from Florida to Memphis International Airport and was fatally shot by police after attacking a nearby dog.


==Film==
In 1952, Paramount Pictures released the Cecil B. DeMille production &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which traced the traveling show through the setup and breakdown of performances during the 1951 season, the show&#x27;s 81st edition since 1871. The film starred Charlton Heston, Betty Hutton, James Stewart, and Emmett Kelly. After its 1952 release, the film was awarded two Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture. A television series of the same title, was inspired by the film, with Jack Palance in the role of Charlton Heston&#x27;s character. Produced by Desilu Productions, the program ran on Tuesday evenings for thirty episodes on ABC in 1963–1964.

In August 2011, 20th Century Fox announced that a biographical musical drama film entitled &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot; was in development. Michael Gracey was set to direct, with Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon as writers. Hugh Jackman plays P.T. Barnum, and produced the film, with Michelle Williams portraying Barnum&#x27;s wife, Charity. Principal photography began in November 2016. The film was released on December 20, 2017.

<text>Cell adhesion is the process by which cells interact and attach to neighbouring cells through specialised molecules of the cell surface. This process can occur either through direct contact between cell surfaces such as cell junctions or indirect interaction, where cells attach to surrounding extracellular matrix, a gel-like structure containing molecules released by cells into spaces between them. Cells adhesion occurs from the interactions between cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs), transmembrane proteins located on the cell surface. Cell adhesion links cells in different ways and can be involved in signal transduction for cells to detect and respond to changes in the surroundings. Other cellular processes regulated by cell adhesion include cell migration and tissue development in multicellular organisms. Alterations in cell adhesion can disrupt important cellular processes and lead to a variety of diseases, including cancer and arthritis. Cell adhesion is also essential for infectious organisms, such as bacteria or viruses, to cause diseases.

==General mechanism==
CAMs are classified into four major families: integrins, immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, cadherins, and selectins. Cadherins and IgSF are homophilic CAMs, as they directly bind to the same type of CAMs on another cell, while integrins and selectins are heterophilic CAMs that bind to different types of CAMs. Each of these adhesion molecules has a different function and recognizes different ligands. Defects in cell adhesion are usually attributable to defects in expression of CAMs.

In multicellular organisms, bindings between CAMs allow cells to adhere to one another and creates structures called cell junctions. According to their functions, the cell junctions can be classified as:

*Anchoring junctions (adherens junctions, desmosomes and hemidesmosomes), which maintain cells together and strengthens contact between cells.
*Occluding junctions (tight junctions), which seal gaps between cells through cell–cell contact, making an impermeable barrier for diffusion
*Channel-forming junctions (gap junctions), which links cytoplasm of adjacent cells allowing transport of molecules to occur between cells
*Signal-relaying junctions, which can be synapses in the nervous system

Alternatively, cell junctions can be categorised into two main types according to what interacts with the cell: cell–cell junctions, mainly mediated by cadherins, and cell–matrix junctions, mainly mediated by integrins.

===Cell–cell junctions===
Cell–cell junctions can occur in different forms. In anchoring junctions between cells such as adherens junctions and desmosomes, the main CAMs present are the cadherins. This family of CAMs are membrane proteins that mediate cell–cell adhesion through its extracellular domains and require extracellular Ca2+ ions to function correctly. Cadherins forms homophilic attachment between themselves, which results in cells of a similar type sticking together and can lead to selective cell adhesion, allowing vertebrate cells to assemble into organised tissues. Cadherins are essential for cell–cell adhesion and cell signalling in multicellular animals and can be separated into two types: classical cadherins and non-classical cadherins.

====Adherens junctions====

Adherens junctions mainly function to maintain the shape of tissues and to hold cells together. In adherens junctions, cadherins between neighbouring cells interact through their extracellular domains, which share a conserved calcium-sensitive region in their extracellular domains. When this region comes into contact with Ca2+ ions, extracellular domains of cadherins undergo a conformational change from the inactive flexible conformation to a more rigid conformation in order to undergo homophilic binding. Intracellular domains of cadherins are also highly conserved, as they bind to proteins called catenins, forming catenin-cadherin complexes. These protein complexes link cadherins to actin filaments. This association with actin filaments is essential for adherens junctions to stabilise cell–cell adhesion. Interactions with actin filaments can also promote clustering of cadherins, which are involved in the assembly of adherens junctions. This is since cadherin clusters promote actin filament polymerisation, which in turn promotes the assembly of adherens junctions by binding to the cadherin–catenin complexes that then form at the junction.

====Desmosomes====
Desmosomes are structurally similar to adherens junctions but composed of different components. Instead of classical cadherins, non-classical cadherins such as desmogleins and desmocollins act as adhesion molecules and they are linked to intermediate filaments instead of actin filaments. No catenin is present in desmosomes, as intracellular domains of desmosomal cadherins interact with desmosomal plaque proteins, which form the thick cytoplasmic plaques in desmosomes and link cadherins to intermediate filaments. Desmosomes provides strength and resistance to mechanical stress by unloading forces onto the flexible but resilient intermediate filaments, something that cannot occur with the rigid actin filaments. This makes desmosomes important in tissues that encounter high levels of mechanical stress, such as heart muscle and epithelia, and explains why it appears frequently in these types of tissues.

====Tight junctions====
Tight junctions are normally present in epithelial and endothelial tissues, where they seal gaps and regulate paracellular transport of solutes and extracellular fluids in these tissues that function as barriers. Tight junction is formed by transmembrane proteins, including claudins, occludins and tricellulins, that bind closely to each other on adjacent membranes in a homophilic manner. Similar to anchoring junctions, intracellular domains of these tight junction proteins are bound with scaffold proteins that keep these proteins in clusters and link them to actin filaments in order to maintain structure of the tight junction. Claudins, essential for formation of tight junctions, form paracellular pores which allow selective passage of specific ions across tight junctions making the barrier selectively permeable.

====Gap junctions====

Gap junctions are composed of channels called connexons, which consist of transmembrane proteins called connexins clustered in groups of six. Connexons from adjacent cells form continuous channels when they come into contact and align with each other. These channels allow transport of ions and small molecules between cytoplasm of two adjacent cells, apart from holding cells together and provide structural stability like anchoring junctions or tight junctions. Gap junction channels are selectively permeable to specific ions depending on which connexins form the connexons, which allows gap junctions to be involved in cell signalling by regulating the transfer of molecules involved in signalling cascades. Channels can respond to many different stimuli and are regulated dynamically either by rapid mechanisms, such as voltage gating, or by slow mechanism, such as altering numbers of channels present in gap junctions.

====Adhesion mediated by selectins====
Selectins are a family of specialised CAMs involved in transient cell–cell adhesion occurring in the circulatory system. They mainly mediate the movement of white blood cells (leukocytes) in the bloodstream by allowing the white blood cells to &quot;roll&quot; on endothelial cells through reversible bindings of selections. Selectins undergo heterophilic bindings, as its extracellular domain binds to carbohydrates on adjacent cells instead of other selectins, while it also require Ca2+ ions to function, same as cadherins. Cell–cell adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is important for immune responses as leukocytes can travel to sites of infection or injury through this mechanism. At these sites, integrins on the rolling white blood cells are activated and bind firmly to the local endothelial cells, allowing the leukocytes to stop migrating and move across the endothelial barrier.

====Adhesion mediated by members of the immunoglobulin superfamily====
The immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) is one of the largest superfamily of proteins in the body and it contains many diverse CAMs involved in different functions. These transmembrane proteins have one or more immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellular domains and undergo calcium-independent binding with ligands on adjacent cells. Some IgSF CAMs, such as neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs), can perform homophilic binding while others, such as intercellular cell adhesion molecules (ICAMs) or vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAMs) undergo heterophilic binding with molecules like carbohydrates or integrins. Both ICAMs and VCAMs are expressed on vascular endothelial cells and they interact with integrins on the leukocytes to assist leukocyte attachment and its movement across the endothelial barrier.

===Cell–matrix junctions===
Cells create extracellular matrix by releasing molecules into its surrounding extracellular space. Cells have specific CAMs that will bind to molecules in the extracellular matrix and link the matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Extracellular matrix can act as a support when organising cells into tissues and can also be involved in cell signalling by activating intracellular pathways when bound to the CAMs.
Cell–matrix junctions are mainly mediated by integrins, which also clusters like cadherins to form firm adhesions. Integrins are transmembrane heterodimers formed by different α and β subunits, both subunits with different domain structures. Integrins can signal in both directions: inside-out signalling, intracellular signals modifying the intracellular domains, can regulate affinity of integrins for their ligands, while outside-in signalling, extracellular ligands binding to extracellular domains, can induce conformational changes in integrins and initiate signalling cascades. Extracellular domains of integrins can bind to different ligands through heterophilic binding while intracellular domains can either be linked to intermediate filaments, forming hemidesmosomes, or to actin filaments, forming focal adhesions.
====Hemidesmosomes====
In hemidesmosomes, integrins attach to extracellular matrix proteins called laminins in the basal lamina, which is the extracellular matrix secreted by epithelial cells. Integrins link extracellular matrix to keratin intermediate filaments, which interacts with intracellular domain of integrins via adapter proteins such as plectins and BP230. Hemidesmosomes are important in maintaining structural stability of epithelial cells by anchoring them together indirectly through the extracellular matrix.

====Focal adhesions====
In focal adhesions, integrins attach fibronectins, a component in the extracellular matrix, to actin filaments inside cells. Adapter proteins, such as talins, vinculins, α-actinins and filamins, form a complex at the intracellular domain of integrins and bind to actin filaments. This multi-protein complex linking integrins to actin filaments is important for assembly of signalling complexes that act as signals for cell growth and cell motility.

==Other organisms==

===Eukaryotes===
Plants cells adhere closely to each other and are connected through plasmodesmata, channels that cross the plant cell walls and connect cytoplasms of adjacent plant cells. Molecules that are either nutrients or signals required for growth are transported, either passively or selectively, between plant cells through plasmodesmata.

Protozoans express multiple adhesion molecules with different specificities that bind to carbohydrates located on surfaces of their host cells. cell–cell adhesion is key for pathogenic protozoans to attach en enter their host cells. An example of a pathogenic protozoan is the malarial parasite (&quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot;), which uses one adhesion molecule called the circumsporozoite protein to bind to liver cells, and another adhesion molecule called the merozoite surface protein to bind red blood cells.

Pathogenic fungi use adhesion molecules present on its cell wall to attach, either through protein-protein or protein-carbohydrate interactions, to host cells or fibronectins in the extracellular matrix.

===Prokaryotes===
Prokaryotes have adhesion molecules on their cell surface termed bacterial adhesins, apart from using its pili (fimbriae) and flagella for cell adhesion. Prokaryotes may have a single or several flagella, either located on one or several places on the cell surface. Pathogenic species such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Vibrio cholera&quot; possess flagella to facilitate adhesion.

Adhesins can recognise a variety of ligands present on the host cell surfaces and also components in the extracellular matrix. These molecules also control host specificity and regulate tropism (tissue- or cell-specific interactions) through their interaction with their ligands.

===Viruses===
Viruses also have adhesion molecules required for viral binding to host cells. For example, influenza virus has a hemagglutinin on its surface that is required for recognition of the sugar sialic acid on host cell surface molecules. HIV has an adhesion molecule termed gp120 that binds to its ligand CD4, which is expressed on lymphocytes. Viruses can also target components of cell junctions to enter host cells, which is what happens when the hepatitis C virus targets occludins and claudins in tight junctions to enter liver cells.

==Clinical implications==
Dysfunction of cell adhesion occurs during cancer metastasis. Loss of cell–cell adhesion in metastatic tumour cells allows them to escape their site of origin and spread through the circulatory system. One example of CAMs deregulated in cancer are cadherins, which are inactivated either by genetic mutations or by other oncogenic signalling molecules, allowing cancer cells to migrate and be more invasive. Other CAMs, like selectins and integrins, can facilitate metastasis by mediating cell–cell interactions between migrating metastatic tumour cells in the circulatory system with endothelial cells of other distant tissues. Due to the link between CAMs and cancer metastasis, these molecules could be potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.

There are also other human genetic diseases caused by an inability to express specific adhesion molecules. An example is leukocyte adhesion deficiency-I (LAD-I), where expression of the β2 integrin subunit is reduced or lost. This leads to reduced expression of β2 integrin heterodimers, which are required for leukocytes to firmly attach to the endothelial wall at sites of inflammation in order to fight infections. Leukocytes from LAD-I patients are unable to adhere to endothelial cells and patients exhibit serious episodes of infection that can be life-threatening.

An autoimmune disease called pemphigus is also caused by loss of cell adhesion, as it results from autoantibodies targeting a person&#x27;s own desmosomal cadherins which leads to epidermal cells detaching from each other and causes skin blistering.

Pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses and protozoans, have to first adhere to host cells in order to infect and cause diseases. Anti-adhesion therapy can be used to prevent infection by targeting adhesion molecules either on the pathogen or on the host cell. Apart from altering the production of adhesion molecules, competitive inhibitors that bind to adhesion molecules to prevent binding between cells can also be used, acting as anti-adhesive agents.

<text>The UCL School of Pharmacy (formerly The School of Pharmacy, University of London) is the pharmacy school of University College London (UCL). The School forms part of UCL&#x27;s Faculty of Life Sciences and is located in London, United Kingdom.

The School was founded by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1842 as the College of the Pharmaceutical Society. It was renamed The School of Pharmacy in 1949 when it became independent of the Pharmaceutical Society and was incorporated into the University of London as a constituent college. The School was granted a royal charter in 1952 and merged with UCL in January 2012.

==History==
The School was founded in 1876 by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, also known as the GPHC. The School began offering University of London degrees in 1925 and joined the university as a specialist school in 1949. It received a Royal Charter in 1952.

Construction of the School&#x27;s current main building, designed by Herbert Rowse, began in 1938, although work was stopped on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 and the building was not completed until 1960. To its alumni and colleagues in the profession it is known as &quot;the Square&quot;, which refers to the fact that it was originally located in Bloomsbury Square and now in Brunswick Square.

It was decided on 13 May 2011, after a consultation and development process, that the School would merge with University College London (UCL). The merger was completed on 1 January 2012, and the School was renamed the UCL School of Pharmacy.

==Departments==

The School is organised into four academic departments, each with one or more associated specialist research centres.

===Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry===
The Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry is the largest of the School&#x27;s departments. Its research is focused on cancer, natural products and phytomedicines, molecular neurosciences and biopharmaceutical analysis.

The department&#x27;s staff help teach the undergraduate MPharm degree in the areas of drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, pharmaceutical chemistry and pharmacognosy/medicinal plants, and an MSc in Pharmacognosy is offered.

===Pharmacology===
The Wellcome Department of Pharmacology is one of the oldest departments of pharmacology in the UK. The department has played a major role in the development of Pharmacology in the UK and many pharmacologists who trained here are to be found in academies and in industries all over the world.

The department&#x27;s research focuses on the nervous system, and a wide range of approaches are used to study normal brain function and the causes of many neurological and psychiatric diseases.

===Pharmaceutics===
The Department of Pharmaceutics is home to a wide range of research activities, such as in Materials Science and Processing and Clinical Pharmaceutical Science.

The department&#x27;s research in Materials Science and Processing is centred on the fundamental properties of materials and their adaptation to optimise processing and enhance drug delivery. It operates a number of joint ventures, including the Centre for Paediatric Pharmacy Research, a joint venture with Great Ormond Street Hospital and the Institute of Child Health, and in the Clinical Pharmaceutics with University College Hospitals and Camden and Islington&#x27;s NHS Trust.

The Microbiology Research Group is also well-established, with work focusing mainly in overcoming antibiotic resistance and obtaining new actives from natural sources. The Group has been particularly successful in investigating new approaches to the treatment of the &#x27;superbug&#x27; MRSA.

===Practice and Policy===
The Department of Practice and Policy focuses upon making the use of medicines safer and more effective through teaching, service and research.

The department has collaborations with organisations including Imperial College London, the London School of Economics, the Institute of Education and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, as well as several major London hospitals including Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27;s, University College Hospital, Hammersmith, Barts and the London, and Great Ormond Street.

The department&#x27;s staff are involved in curricular development and teaching across all four years of the MPharm course. Its student body includes hospital pharmacists studying for a range of Certificate, Diploma and MSc qualifications.

==Courses==
The School offers a number of master&#x27;s degree programmes, including Drug Discovery, Drug Delivery, Pharmacognosy and Pharmacy Practice, and PhD research degrees. The only undergraduate degree which it currently offers is the four-year MPharm, Master of Pharmacy. The School offered BSc degrees in Toxicology and Pharmacology until 2001.

==Research and rankings==
In 2010/11 the School had a total research income of £8.13 million. In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, 90 per cent of the research activity at the School was deemed &quot;internationally significant&quot; and 25 per cent &quot;world-leading&quot;.

The School&#x27;s research focuses on advancing and understanding medicines and health care, and in creating new medicines. It is organised into four divisions:
* Drug Discovery;
* Formulation Sciences;
* Neurosciences; and
* Medicines Use and Health.

The School is home to the following research centres:
* Cancer Research UK Biomolecular Structure Group; 
* Cancer Research UK Gene Targeted Design Research Group; 
* Molecular Neuroscience Research Group; Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy; 
* Centre for Pharmaceutical Analysis; Centre for Drug Delivery Research; 
* Centre for Toxicology; 
* Centre for Paediatric Pharmacy Research; and
* Centre for Behavioural Medicine; and Centre for Cancer Medicines.

In the 2015 &quot;QS World University Rankings by Subject&quot;, UCL is ranked 5th in the world (and 3rd in Europe) for Pharmacy &amp; Pharmacology.

<doc id="531067" wikidata="Q7621031" url="?curid=531067" title="Straight Plan for the Gay Man">
<text>Straight Plan for the Gay Man is an American comedy television series that premiered on February 23, 2004, on Comedy Central. It is a parody of Bravo&#x27;s hit &quot;Queer Eye for the Straight Guy&quot;. Four straight comedians (the &quot;Flab Four&quot;) – Curtis Gwinn (environment guy), Billy Merritt (appearance guy), Kyle Grooms (information guy), and Rob Riggle (culture guy) – make over three gay men to pass as straight. The show ran for three episodes.

The makeovers include lessons in poor manners, spartan home decorating, unfashionable wardrobes, and an overdeveloped ego to mask all personal failings. Episodes involved making over a fashion salesman into a meat-packer, a yoga instructor into a jock, and an entertainer into a suave &quot;babe-magnet&quot;.

==Reception==

The show received mostly negative reception from critics. Niamh Slevin of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; gave the series one star out of five, calling it &quot;nothing short of pitiful&quot; and saying that &quot;Comedy Central should be ashamed to produce something as bland and trite as &quot;Straight Plan&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot;&#x27;s review stated that, while the show&#x27;s direct references to &quot;Queer Eye&quot; are funny, &quot;there’s no place for this to go, really, beyond paying homage to the far funnier [...] &quot;Queer Eye&quot;, while indulging in the most obvious Man Show stereotypes about straights.&quot; In a more favorable review, Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show &quot;as engaging as the show it mercilessly mocks,&quot; and that each of the three episodes was &quot;similar, yet just different enough to hold viewers&#x27; attention.&quot;
