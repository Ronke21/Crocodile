<text>Frank Shepard Fairey (born February 15, 1970) is an American contemporary artist, activist and founder of OBEY Clothing who emerged from the skateboarding scene. In 1989, he designed the &quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot; (...OBEY...) sticker campaign while attending the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).

Fairey designed the Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster for the 2008 U.S. presidential election. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, has described him as one of the best known and most influential street artists. His work is included in the collections at The Smithsonian; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art in New York City; the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.; the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond; and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

His style has been described as a &quot;bold iconic style that is based on styling and idealizing images.&quot;

==Early life==
Shepard Fairey was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina. His father, Strait Fairey, is a doctor, and his mother, Charlotte, a realtor. He attended Porter-Gaud School in Charleston and transferred to high school at Idyllwild Arts Academy in Idyllwild, California, from which he graduated in 1988.

Fairey became involved with art in 1984, when he started to place his drawings on skateboards and T-shirts. He moved to Rhode Island in 1988 to attend the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). In 1992, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Illustration from RISD.

== Career ==

===Obey Giant sticker ===
Fairey created the &quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot; sticker campaign in 1989, while attending the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). This later evolved into the &quot;Obey Giant&quot; campaign, which has grown via an international network of collaborators replicating Fairey&#x27;s original designs. Fairey intended the Obey Giant to inspire curiosity and cause people to question their relationship with their surroundings. According to the Obey Giant website, &quot;The sticker has no meaning but exists only to cause people to react, to contemplate and search for meaning in the sticker&quot;. The website also says, by contrast, that those who are familiar with the sticker find humor and enjoyment from it and that those who try to analyze its meaning only burden themselves and may condemn the art as an act of vandalism from an evil, underground cult.

Originally intending the sticker campaign to gain fame among his classmates and college peers, Fairey says:
At first I was only thinking about the response from my clique of art school and skateboard friends. The fact that a larger segment of the public would not only notice, but investigate, the unexplained appearance of the stickers was something I had not contemplated. When I started to see reactions and consider the sociological forces at work surrounding the use of public space and the insertion of a very eye-catching but ambiguous image, I began to think there was the potential to create a phenomenon.

In a manifesto he wrote in 1990 to 1991, and since posted on his website, he links his work with Heidegger&#x27;s concept of phenomenology. His &quot;Obey&quot; Campaign is from the John Carpenter movie &quot;They Live&quot; which starred pro wrestler Roddy Piper, taking a number of its slogans, including the &quot;Obey&quot; slogan, as well as the &quot;This is Your God&quot; slogan. Fairey has spun off the OBEY clothing line from the original sticker campaign. He also uses the slogan &quot;The Medium is the Message&quot; borrowed from Marshall McLuhan. Shepard Fairey has stated in an interview that part of his work is inspired by other street artists.

===Post-graduation===
After graduation, he founded a small printing business in Providence, Rhode Island, called Alternate Graphics, specializing in T-shirt and sticker silkscreens, which afforded Fairey the ability to continue pursuing his own artwork. While residing in Providence in 1994, Fairey met American filmmaker Helen Stickler, who had also attended RISD and graduated with a film degree. The following spring, Stickler completed a short documentary film about Shepard and his work, titled &quot;Andre the Giant Has a Posse&quot;. The film premiered in the 1995 New York Underground Film Festival and went on to play at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. It has been seen in more than 70 festivals and museums internationally.

&quot;From the late ’90s until about 2001,&quot; writes Ken Leighton in &quot;The San Diego Reader&quot;, Fairey lived in East Village, San Diego, where, according to a friend quoted in the article, he co-founded a &quot;guerrilla marketing company called Black Market Design.&quot; According to John Goff, a former member of the San Diego–based &quot;tribal post-punk&quot; industrial-noise performance art band Crash Worship, Fairey began appropriating the Russian Constructivist style utilized in Soviet-era propaganda during his time in San Diego. &quot;&#x27;I think he became an art icon when he started focusing on Communist imagery,&#x27; Goff says. &#x27;He was still in San Diego then. I first met him when he was working above Hooter’s in the Gaslamp.&#x27;&quot;
Fairey was a founding partner, along with Dave Kinsey and Phillip DeWolff, of the design studio BLK/MRKT Inc. from 1997 to 2003, which specialized in guerrilla marketing, and &quot;the development of high-impact marketing campaigns&quot;. Clients included Pepsi, Hasbro and Netscape (for whom Fairey designed the red dinosaur version of mozilla.org&#x27;s logo and mascot).

In 2003, he founded the Studio Number One design agency with his wife, Amanda Fairey. The agency produced the cover work for The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; album &quot;Monkey Business&quot; and the poster for the film &quot;Walk the Line&quot;. Fairey has also designed the covers for The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; album &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, Flogging Molly&#x27;s CD/DVD &quot;Whiskey on a Sunday&quot;, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s compilation &quot;Mothership&quot; and movie &quot;Celebration Day&quot;, and Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;The Greater Of Two Evils&quot;. Along with Banksy, Dmote, and others, Fairey created work at a warehouse exhibition in Alexandria, Sydney, for &quot;Semi-Permanent&quot; in 2003. Approximately 1,500 people attended.

In 2004, Fairey joined artists Robbie Conal and Mear One to create a series of &quot;anti-war, anti-Bush&quot; posters for a street art campaign called &quot;Be the Revolution&quot; for the art collective &quot;Post Gen&quot;. &quot;Be the Revolution&quot; kicked off with a night of performances featuring Z-Trip, Ozomatli and David J at the Avalon in Hollywood. Fairey also co-founded &quot;Swindle Magazine&quot; along with Roger Gastman.
In 2005, he collaborated for a second time with Z-Trip on a limited edition 12-inch featuring Chuck D entitled &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;. In 2005 Fairey also collaborated with DJ Shadow on a box set, with T-shirts, stickers, prints, and a mix CD by Shadow. In 2005 he showed abroad, for instance in Paris at the Magda Danysz Gallery, and was a resident artist at the Honolulu Museum of Art Spalding House (formerly known as The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu). Also in 2005, Fairey contributed the artwork for the posters, cover art, and graphics for &quot;Walk The Line&quot; the Johnny Cash biopic. In 2006, Fairey contributed eight vinyl etchings to a limited-edition series of 12&quot; singles by post-punk band Mission of Burma and has also done work for the musical group Interpol.

In 2006, Fairey joined NYC based Ad agency &quot;Project 2050&quot; as founding Creative Director and was featured on the cover of Advertising Age magazine. While at Project 2050 Shepard developed creative work for Virgin Mega Store and Boost Mobile. The book &quot;Supply and Demand: The Art of Shepard Fairey&quot; was released in 2006. In 2008, &quot;Philosophy of Obey (Obey Giant): The Formative Years (1989–2008)&quot;, edited by Sarah Jaye Williams, was published by Nerve Books UK, and praised by Fairey.

In June 2007, Fairey opened his one-man show entitled &quot;E Pluribus Venom&quot;, at the Jonathan LeVine Gallery. The show made the arts section front page in the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

Fairey donated original cover art to the 2008 album &quot;Body of War: Songs That Inspired an Iraq War Veteran&quot;, produced for Iraq War documentary &quot;Body of War&quot;. Proceeds from the album benefit non-profit organization Iraq Veterans Against the War.

In 2008, Fairey teamed up again with Z-Trip to do a series of shows in support of then-presidential candidate Barack Obama entitled Party For Change. Fairey also designed posters for the British goth band Bauhaus.
In September 2008, Shepard opened his solo show titled &quot;Duality of Humanity&quot; at White Walls &amp; Shooting Gallery in San Francisco. His third solo show with the gallery featured one hundred and fifty works, including the largest collection of canvases pieces in one show that he&#x27;s done.

Fairey was arrested on February 7, 2009, on his way to the premiere of his show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts, on two outstanding warrants related to graffiti. He was charged with damage to property for having postered two Boston area locations with graffiti, a Boston Police Department spokesman said. His arrest was announced to party goers by longtime friend Z-Trip who had been performing at the ICA premiere at Shepard Fairey&#x27;s request.

On April 27, 2009, Fairey put three signed copies of his Obama inauguration posters up on eBay, with the proceeds of the auction going to the One Love For Chi foundation, founded by the family of Deftones bassist Chi Cheng following a car accident in November 2008 that nearly claimed Cheng&#x27;s life.

Fairey&#x27;s first art museum exhibition, titled &quot;Supply &amp; Demand&quot; (as was his earlier book), was held in Boston at the Institute of Contemporary Art during the summer of 2009. The exhibition featured more than 250 works in a wide variety of media: screen prints, stencils, stickers, rubylith illustrations, collages, and works on wood, metal and canvas. As a complement to the ICA exhibition, Fairey created public art works around Boston. The artist explains his driving motivation: &quot;The real message behind most of my work is &#x27;question everything&#x27;.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Time Magazine&quot; commissioned Fairey to design its cover to honor &quot;The Protester&quot; as Person of the Year in the wake of the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street and other social movements around the world. This was Fairey&#x27;s second Person of the Year cover for &quot;Time&quot;, his first being of Barack Obama in 2008.

In January 2015, Shepard Fairey made a cameo appearance on &quot;Portlandia&quot;. In July 2015, Fairey was arrested and detained at Los Angeles International Airport, after passing through customs, on a warrant for allegedly vandalizing 14 buildings in Detroit. He subsequently turned himself in to Detroit Police.

On September 17, 2015, the Jacob Lewis Gallery presented Shepard Fairey&#x27;s exhibition &quot;On Our Hands&quot;, his first solo opening in New York City in five years. The paintings reflect on contemporary issues facing our global community: political corruption, environmental apathy and abuse of power. The exhibition coincides with Fairey&#x27;s new monograph Covert to Overt, published by Rizzoli.

=== Barack Obama &quot;Hope&quot; poster ===

Fairey created a series of posters supporting Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 candidacy for President of the United States, including the iconic &quot;HOPE&quot; portrait. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; art critic Peter Schjeldahl called the poster &quot;the most efficacious American political illustration since &#x27;Uncle Sam Wants You&#x27;&quot;. Fairey also created an exclusive design for Rock the Vote. Because the &quot;Hope&quot; poster had been &quot;perpetuated illegally&quot; and independently by the street artist, the Obama campaign declined to have any direct affiliation with it. Although the campaign officially disavowed any involvement in the creation or popularization of the poster, Fairey has commented in interviews that he was in communication with campaign officials during the period immediately following the poster&#x27;s release. Fairey has stated that the original version featured the word &quot;PROGRESS&quot; instead of the word &quot;HOPE&quot;, and that within weeks of its release, the campaign requested that he issue (and legally disseminate) a new version, keeping the powerful image of Obama&#x27;s face but captioning it with the word &quot;HOPE&quot;. The campaign openly embraced the revised poster along with two additional Fairey posters that featured the words &quot;CHANGE&quot; and &quot;VOTE&quot;.

Fairey distributed 300,000 stickers and 500,000 posters during the campaign, funding his grassroots electioneering through poster and fine art sales. &quot;I just put all that money back into making more stuff, so I didn&#x27;t keep any of the Obama money&quot;, explained Fairey in December 2009.

In February 2008, Fairey received a letter of thanks from Obama for his contribution to the campaign. The letter stated:


On November 5, 2008, Chicago posted banners throughout the downtown business district featuring Fairey&#x27;s Obama &quot;HOPE&quot; portrait.

Fairey created a similar but new image of Barack Obama for &quot;Time magazine&quot;, which was used as the cover art for the 2008 Person of the Year issue. The original iconic &quot;HOPE&quot; portrait was featured on the cover of &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;&#x27;s February 2009 issue, this time with a caption reading, &quot;WHAT NOW?&quot; Shepard Fairey&#x27;s influence throughout the presidential election was a factor in the artist himself having been named a Person of the Year for 2008 by &quot;GQ&quot;.

In October 2008, Fairey created a small edition of serigraphs entitled &quot;Obama Hope Gold (from Artists for Obama)&quot;. This portfolio was produced through a partnership between Gemini G.E.L. printing studio and the Democratic National Committee. The project supported the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. The Gold serigraphs were released just after Obama’s inauguration, and are the third and final edition of Fairey’s Hope prints of the president. The edition was released shortly after the Inauguration. An example of this work is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

In January 2009, the &quot;HOPE&quot; portrait was acquired by the U.S. National Portrait Gallery and made part of its permanent collection. It was unveiled and put on display on January 17, 2009.

Also in January 2009, photographer and blogger Tom Gralish discovered that the poster was based on an Associated Press photograph by freelance photographer Mannie Garcia. Fairey subsequently filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine. Fairey subsequently admitted that he had based the poster on the AP photograph and had fabricated and destroyed evidence to hide the fact. Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein urged a settlement, stating that AP would win the case. The AP and Shepard Fairey settled out of court in January 2011. In 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to one count of criminal contempt of court for his destruction of evidence and submission of false images to the court, and was sentenced by U.S. magistrate judge Frank Maas of the Southern District of New York to two years&#x27; probation and a $25,000 fine.

In 2009, Fairey&#x27;s Obama portrait was featured in the book &quot;Art For Obama: Designing Manifest Hope and the Campaign for Change&quot;, which Fairey also edited.

In his December 8, 2010, appearance on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, Stephen Colbert asked Fairey how he felt about having done the &quot;HOPE&quot; portrait of Obama and how &quot;that hope was working out for him now?&quot; to which Fairey replied: &quot;You know, I&#x27;m proud of it as a piece of grassroots activism, but I&#x27;ll just leave it at that&quot;.

In an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; in 2015, Fairey said that Obama had not lived up to his expectations, &quot;not even close&quot;. He continued, &quot;Obama has had a really tough time, but there have been a lot of things that he&#x27;s compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things I would have thought [he&#x27;d support].&quot;

Fairey created a mutt version of the red, white, and blue poster, donating it to help support pet adoptions, from an image of a rescued shaggy dog taken by photographer Clay Myers. Four hundred limited edition prints were offered by Adopt-A-Pet.com, a nonprofit organization that helps shelters, humane societies and rescue groups advertise their homeless pets to potential adopters. The poster, which was also offered as a free download, was featured on the cover of the spring 2009 edition of &quot;Dog’s Life&quot; magazine.

===The &quot;Mandela&quot; mural===

In 2014, Fairey painted a towering mural, 9 stories high, paying tribute to Nelson Mandela and the 25th anniversary of the Purple Rain Protest. It is a public artwork on Juta Street in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, overlooking the Nelson Mandela Bridge. 

&quot;It is a huge exclamation point downtown...&quot; said Patrick Gaspard, American Ambassador to South Africa, which makes us remember the entire liberation struggle and the remarkably peaceful transition to freedom Nelson Mandela achieved if you don;t bother looking at the necklacing and farm murders.

===Honest Gil Fulbright===
Fairey created an adaptation of the Obama HOPE poster for satirical Kentucky politician Honest Gil Fulbright. Frank L. Ridley, the actor who portrays Fulbright, is featured on the poster, along with the word &quot;SOLD&quot;, which refers to Fulbright&#x27;s &quot;honest&quot; political message: &quot;I&#x27;m only in this thing for the money, but at least I&#x27;m honest about it.&quot;

===Marianne===
As a tribute to the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks, Fairey created a poster representing Marianne, the French national icon, surrounded by the national motto &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;. In June 2016, this design was painted as a mural on 186 rue Nationale, Paris. Fairey made a gift of the poster to Emmanuel Macron, who hung it in his office upon assuming the presidency of France.
In the night of the 13th December 2020, an anonymous group tagged over the mural in an act of protest against the state. The motto was crossed out with white paint and replaced by the tag &quot;Marianne pleure&quot; (Marianne cries), and red tears were added to the face of Marianne. Fairey reacted to the act by declaring his support for all who protest against injustice and that he understood the goals of the action.

=== We the People series ===
This series was made during the 2016 presidential campaign as a protest on Donald Trump&#x27;s declarations and policies. This work aims to promote gender equality and fights discrimination against minorities. This work stands out to many as it provokes people to respect their common humanity. The title of the work comes from a line in the Constitution and features portraits of Native Americans, African Americans, Muslims, and Latinas, aiming to defend their dignity.

In October 2017, Shepard Fairey went to Treason Gallery in Seattle and met Alex Codd. [reference: instagram]

=== Make Art Not War ===
This work is a mural for Urban Nation in Berlin, Germany. The street art was created in 2014 by Fairey. The work became a motto for street artists and demonstrated Fairey&#x27;s political support for anti-war movements and peace. The work was made like traditional street art with spray paint and features many of Fairey&#x27;s motifs and symbols from other works. This repetition includes the black and red cartoon-like style with repetition of symbols such as roses.

=== Kamala Harris &quot;Forward&quot; poster ===
Fairey created a poster supporting Kamala Harris&#x27; 2024 candidacy for President of the United States. Writing on Instagram, he said, &quot;We have a very real opportunity to move forward,&quot; citing a desire for &quot;a healthy planet, for corporate accountability, toward equality and away from racism, sexism, xenophobia, and homophobia, for equitable access to opportunity, for full access to the medical care we want or need, for fair and just immigration policies.&quot; Like his previous work on the Barack Obama HOPE poster, he was not paid to create this work.

==Activism and humanitarianism==
In the early 2000s, Fairey began donating to organizations such as Chiapas Relief Fund, the ACLU, Feeding America, and the Art of Elysium. Following the Obama campaign, Fairey donated proceeds from these poster sales to the ACLU and Feeding America. In September 2010, Fairey created a poster for the ACLU with actress Olivia Wilde as the Statue of Liberty holding a megaphone and a clipboard, the ACLU&#x27;s weapons of choice.

The Obey Awareness Program, operated by Obey Clothing, was founded in 2007 as an extension of Fairey&#x27;s humanitarian efforts. This program allows Fairey to support causes he believes in by selling specially designed merchandise and donating 100% of the profits raised to handpicked organizations and their causes. Past non-profit organizations benefiting from this program include Hope for Darfur, 11th Hour Action, Feed America, earthquake relief in Haiti, Dark Wave / Rising Sun for Japan relief, and Adopt-a-Pet.com. Environmentally related non-profit organizations such as the Surfrider Foundation, Urban Roots, the Alaskan Wildlife Refuge and more also received donations. The latest Obey Awareness T-shirts benefitted the Go Campaign, an organization that improves the lives of orphans and vulnerable children around the world by partnering with local heroes to deliver local solutions.

Fairey sits on the advisory board of Reaching to Embrace the Arts, a nonprofit organization that provides art supplies to disadvantaged schools and students. In 2007, Fairey was commissioned to create a logo for &quot;Music Is Revolution Foundation&quot; and became a board member of the Music Is Revolution Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports music education for students in public schools.

As a type 1 diabetic, Fairey often contributes to non-profit organizations assisting in medical research. He is one of the earliest supporters of Give to Cure, a non-profit organization devoted to accelerating the process of finding cures for human diseases. Fairey created the first Give To Cure sticker series with 20 distinct designs. In addition, he created three special edition prints to commemorate the inaugural Give To Cure campaign. In January 2012, Fairey created an exclusive print called &quot;The Cure&quot; for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes research. All proceeds from the sale went toward the JDRF. In June 2013, a feature documentary called &quot;The Human Trial&quot; about the quest to cure type 1 diabetes caught the attention of Fairey who then created the movie poster in order to raise funds for the film.

Every year since 2009, Fairey has contributed his art to raise funds for the RUSH Philanthropic Arts Foundation. In August 2011, Fairey donated the Buddhist inspired piece Mandala Ornament (valued at $12,000) to help raise funds for the Foundation through the ART FOR LIFE online auction, the primary annual fundraising effort that helps support thousands of underserved New York children. Proceeds from the annual gala and auction benefitted the Foundation&#x27;s signature arts education and gallery programs, which directly serve 2,300 students each year.

In June 2009, Fairey created a poster in support of the plight of Aung San Suu Kyi to bring awareness to the human rights cause in Burma. The proceeds from this print benefitted the Human Rights Action Center and the U.S. Campaign for Burma.

In 2009, Fairey teamed up with artist and activist Ernesto Yerena, activist Marco Amador and musician Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, to create, distribute, and sell posters countering dehumanizing and anti-immigrant rhetoric for the We Are Human Campaign. A majority of the proceeds went to the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) and Puente, a grassroots community group that fights for human dignity.

Fairey has also created artwork to benefit the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace (DLF). In April 2009, Fairey created a poster for the David Lynch Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; benefit concert. In April 2011, Fairey donated unique collector&#x27;s items to the foundation&#x27;s &quot;Download for Good&quot; campaign. In April 2015, Fairey created a commemorative poster for the 10-year anniversary of the music of David Lynch, with all proceeds from poster sales going to the foundation.

In November 2009, Fairey partnered with LGBT grassroots organization FAIR to auction &quot;Defend Equality Love Unites&quot; posters to raise awareness and funds for the fight for gay and lesbian marriage equality.

Fairey is a supporter of artist movements such as The Art of Elysium, an organization aiming to affect social change by making art available to striving artists and young people battling serious illnesses. In August 2010, Fairey donated one original Burmese Monk fine art piece as well as an opportunity for a live portrait sitting for Art of Elysium. In September 2014, Fairey curated The Art of Elysium&#x27;s GENESIS showcase of emerging L.A. artists, creatives, , and social leaders.

In May 2010, Fairey partnered with Feeding America and The Advertising Council to create an outdoor public service advertisement to raise awareness about domestic hunger.

In 2011, Fairey was named honorary chair of the Young Literati, a philanthropic group of the Library Foundation of Los Angeles. Fairey has created artwork and curated several Young Literati Annual Toast events benefitting the Library Foundation. Fairey&#x27;s wife Amanda has held the position of chair of the Library Foundation since 2013.

In December 2011, Fairey contributed to the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation&#x27;s inaugural &quot;Artist as Activist&quot; print project to benefit the Coalition for the Homeless. Fairey created an original print called &quot;The Future is Unwritten&quot; to commemorate Rauschenburg&#x27;s dedication to important social issues and the mission of the Coalition for the Homeless. The print was sold on Artnet to raise over $150,000 to support the Coalition&#x27;s life-saving programs.

In July 2013, Fairey did a public arts project for the nonprofit L.A. Fund for Education. Fairey&#x27;s design titled &quot;Create Your Future&quot; was one of three installments in the #ArtsMatter campaign, which was a collaborative effort with P.S. ARTS and featured the art displayed on billboards and buses across the city of Los Angeles to send the message that arts matter in schools. Again in 2015, Fairey contributed to P.S. Arts, and collaborated with Marc Phillips Decorative Rugs to create a one-of-kind rug for a benefit auction for P.S. Arts.

In March 2014, Fairey created a portrait of Ai Weiwei with &quot;Friends of Ai Weiwei&quot;, a group of Ai supporters who were trying to promote awareness of the artists’ legal status in China where authorities had confiscated his passport. Proceeds from the posters went toward Friends of Ai Weiwei&#x27;s efforts to help the artist and to promote free speech. The following year Ai Weiwei was granted a visa, reversing a decision not to grant him the travel document.

Shepard Fairey has also created works to support school safety, and posters with his art were seen at the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018.

Street art is characterized by a nonpermissive art method of production, which reveals the rebellious nature and activism that challenges the viewer&#x27;s perspective regarding the surrounding environment. Street art has features that distinguish it from other art forms such as graffiti and public art. The defiant nature of the art form itself reveals the defiant structure of Fairey&#x27;s art and the political challenge it has on others.

==Legal issues with appropriation and fair use==

Fairey has been criticized for failing to obtain permission and to provide attribution for works he used. Fairey has threatened to sue artists for the same technique. Austin, Texas–based graphic designer Baxter Orr did his own take on Fairey&#x27;s work in a piece called &quot;Protect&quot;, with the iconic Obey Giant face covered by a SARS respiratory mask. Orr marketed the prints as his own work. On April 23, 2008, Orr received a cease-and-desist order from Fairey&#x27;s attorneys, telling him to stop selling &quot;Protect&quot; because it violated Fairey&#x27;s trademark. Fairey threatened to sue, calling the designer a &quot;parasite&quot;.

Originally, Fairey had claimed his HOPE poster was based on a 2006 copyrighted photo of then-Senator Barack Obama seated next to actor George Clooney, taken in April 2006 by Mannie Garcia on assignment for the Associated Press, which wanted credit and compensation for the work. Garcia believes that he personally owns the copyright for the photo, and has said, &quot;If you put all the legal stuff away, I’m so proud of the photograph and that Fairey did what he did artistically with it, and the effect it&#x27;s had&quot;. Fairey said his use of the photograph fell within the legal definition of fair use. Fairey claims he used pieces of the photo as raw material to create a heroic and inspirational political portrait, the aesthetic of which was fundamentally different from the original photo. Lawyers for both sides tried to reach an amicable agreement.

In February 2009, Fairey filed a federal lawsuit against the Associated Press, seeking a declaratory judgment that his use of the AP photograph was protected by the fair use doctrine and so did not infringe their copyright. At first, Fairey claimed that he used the photo of Clooney and Obama, cropped the actor out of the shot, and made other changes. In October 2009, Shepard Fairey admitted he had tried to deceive the Court by destroying evidence that he had instead used the photograph alleged by the AP. Fairey admitted he had used a close-up shot of Obama, also taken by Mannie Garcia, as the AP had long alleged. The solo photo appears much more similar to the final HOPE poster than the photo of Clooney and Obama. Fairey&#x27;s lawyers announced they were no longer representing him, and Laurence Pulgram, an intellectual property lawyer, stated that the revelation put Mr. Fairey&#x27;s case in trouble.

In May 2010, a judge urged Fairey to settle. The parties settled in January 2011. On February 24, 2012, Fairey pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court for &quot;destroying documents and manufacturing evidence.&quot; On September 7, 2012, Fairey was sentenced to 300 hours of community service, ordered to pay a $25,000 federal fine, and placed on probation for two years by U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas.

Fairey was also charged with destruction of property in 2015 for tagging 18 posters at unsanctioned sites. The case was later dismissed.

==Writing==
In 2024, Shepard Fairey wrote the afterword to &quot;Iggy and The Stooges: The Authorized Biography&quot; by authorized Alice Cooper biographer Jeffrey Morgan. 

==Critical response==
Liam O&#x27;Donoghue interviewed Fairey for &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and questioned the artist about criticism related to his use of images from social movements, specifically images created by black artists. O&#x27;Donoghue later posted an article, titled &quot;Shepard Fairey’s Image Problem&quot;, on several independent media sites. O&#x27; Donoghue explored Fairey&#x27;s use of copyright-protected images while defending his own copyright-protected works from being used by other artists and corporations. Fairey cited his collaboration with Public Enemy, his funding of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and his six-figure charitable contributions for Darfur assistance as responses to charges of exploitation:
&quot;I challenge anybody to fuck with that, know what I mean&quot;, Fairey stated. &quot;It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m just jumping on some cool rebel cause for the sake of exploiting it for profit. People like to talk shit, but it&#x27;s usually to justify their own apathy. I don&#x27;t want to demean anyone&#x27;s struggles through casual appropriation of something powerful; that&#x27;s not my intention.&quot;

Erick Lyle has accused Fairey of cynically turning graffiti culture into a self-promoting advertising campaign. On the other hand, &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; art critic Robert L. Pincus says Fairey&#x27;s work &quot;is political art with a strong sense of visual style and emotional authenticity. Even in times when political art has ebbed, Fairey&#x27;s has just the right balance of seriousness, irony and wit to fit the mood of the moment&quot;. &quot;The Walrus&quot; contributor Nick Mount wrote &quot;Following the example set by gallery art, some street art is more about the concept than the art. &#x27;Fuck Bush&#x27; isn’t an aesthetic; it’s an ethic. Shepard Fairey’s Obey Giant stickers and Akay’s Akayism posters are clever children of Duchamp, ironic conceptual art.&quot; But Stephen Heller of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that Fairey&#x27;s political art has similarities to political art from the past, for instance to political art created by Andy Warhol.

In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review of &quot;E Pluribus Venom&quot; at Jonathan LeVine Gallery, art critic Benjamin Genocchio described Fairey&#x27;s art as &quot;generic&quot; despite the range of mediums and styles used by the artist. Genocchio went on to say that it was tempting to see Fairey&#x27;s art as just another luxury commodity.

Andrew Michael Ford, the director of Ad Hoc Art, said that Fairey&#x27;s practice does not &quot;match up&quot; in the minds of people who view his work. Ford suggests that some people will view Fairey&#x27;s work as &quot;very commercial&quot;. In his comments, he suggested that Fairey is &quot;ripe&quot; for criticism because he profits from politically and socially charged works. Ford stated that, despite his criticism, he is a fan of Fairey work.

Artists Mark Vallen, Lincoln Cushing, Josh MacPhee, and Favianna Rodriguez have documented that Fairey has appropriated work by Koloman Moser, Ralph Chaplin, Pirkle Jones, Rupert Garcia, Rene Mederos, Félix Beltrán, and Gary Grimshaw, among others. In his critique, &quot;Obey Plagiarist Shepard Fairey&quot;, Vallen dissects various works by Fairey, demonstrating them to be plagiarized from the work of other artists. Jamie O&#x27;Shea criticizes Vallen&#x27;s approach for a &quot;nearly ubiquitous lack of understanding of the artist’s use of appropriated imagery in his work and the longstanding historical precedent for this mode of creative expression,&quot; in addition to being masked in a thin &quot;veneer of obvious envy in most cases&quot;.

Art critic Brian Sherwin lashed out at O’Shea&#x27;s criticism of Mark Vallen by saying that O’Shea&#x27;s &quot;SUPERTOUCH&quot; article was nothing more than &quot;damage control&quot;. Sherwin questioned O’Shea&#x27;s defense of Fairey, noting that Fairey is a &quot;SUPERTOUCH&quot; author and business associate of O’Shea. Sherwin suggests that O’Shea has a &quot;vested&quot; interest in making sure that Fairey is viewed positively by the public since he has curated art exhibits involving Fairey and has written extensively about the artist. Sherwin wrote that O’Shea once served as editor in chief for &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; and has worked as a creative director hired by corporate art collections as a corporate liaison for acquisitions. Sherwin concluded that the public will &quot;question the artist who says to question everything,&quot; regardless of O’Shea&#x27;s Mark Vallen &quot;damage control&quot; on &quot;SUPERTOUCH.&quot; Sherwin implied that O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s critique of Vallen was selective because key negative facts about Fairey&#x27;s history were left out in the article. The dispute between Sherwin and O’Shea was cited by Dan Wasserman on &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;’s &quot;Out of Line&quot;.

Bloggers have criticized Fairey for accepting commissions from corporations such as Saks Fifth Avenue, for which his design agency produced illustrations inspired by Constructivism and Alexander Rodchenko. Fairey defends his corporate commissions by saying that clients such as Saks Fifth Avenue help him to keep his studio operational and his assistants employed. Fairey has acknowledged the irony of being a street artist exploring themes of free speech while at the same time being an artist hired by corporations for consumer campaigns. He says simply that designers and artists have to make money to survive:
&quot;I consider myself a populist artist,&quot; Fairey says. &quot;I want to reach people through as many different platforms as possible. Street art is a bureaucracy-free way of reaching people, but T-shirts, stickers, commercial jobs, the Internet – there are so many different ways that I use to put my work in front of people.&quot;

In August 2011, Fairey received a black eye and a bruised rib after being attacked outside of the Kodboderne 18 nightclub in Copenhagen, Denmark. Fairey claims the two assailants called him &quot;Obama illuminati&quot; and ordered him to &quot;go back to America&quot;. He believes the attack was the result of a misunderstanding over his artwork, which commemorated the demolition of the legendary Ungdomshuset (youth house) at Jagtvej 69. His mural showed a peace dove in flight surrounded by a circle of Tønder lace above the word &quot;Peace&quot;; it was vandalized within 24 hours of its unveiling with graffiti slogans &quot;no peace&quot; and &quot;go home, Yankee hipster&quot;.

The media reported that the artwork was commissioned by the Copenhagen Municipality, but the original mural was organized by Fairey&#x27;s Copenhagen gallery, V1. It was not a government-sponsored work.

<text>==History==

During the early years of spaceflight only nation states had the resources to develop and fly spacecraft. Both the U.S. space program and Soviet space program were operated using mainly military (ex Airforce) pilots as astronauts. During this period, no commercial space launches were available to private operators, and no private organization was able to offer space launches.

In the 1980s, the European Space Agency created Arianespace, the world&#x27;s first commercial space transportation company, and, following the Challenger disaster, the American government deregulated the American space transportation market as well. In the 1990s the Russian government sold their majority stake in RSC Energia to private investors (although it has recently renationalized the Russian space sector in 2013–2014.) 
These events for the first time allowed private organizations to purchase, develop and offer space launch services; beginning the period of private spaceflight in the late-1980s and early-1990s.

==Satellite manufacturers==
There are 10 major companies that build large, commercial, Geosynchronous satellite platforms:
In addition to those above, the following companies have successfully built and launched (smaller) satellite platforms:

==Launch vehicle manufacturers and providers of third party services==

Commercial wings of national space agencies:
* Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC) and Taiwan Aerospace Industry Association (TAIA) Taiwan
* Antrix Corporation and NSIL India
* China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation China

==Lander, rover and probe manufacturers==

==Spacecraft component manufacturers==

==Propulsion manufacturers==

*List of private spaceflight companies including only companies with primarily private funding and missions (&quot;NewSpace&quot;)
*Russian aerospace industry

<text>A lock is a mechanical or electronic fastening device that is released by a physical object (such as a key, keycard, fingerprint, RFID card, security token or coin), by supplying secret information (such as a number or letter permutation or password), by a combination thereof, or it may only be able to be opened from one side, such as a door chain.

A key is a device that is used to operate a lock (to lock or unlock it). A typical key is a small piece of metal consisting of two parts: the &quot;bit&quot; or &quot;blade&quot;, which slides into the keyway of the lock and distinguishes between different keys, and the &quot;bow&quot;, which is left protruding so that torque can be applied by the user. In its simplest implementation, a key operates one lock or set of locks that are keyed alike, a lock/key system where each similarly keyed lock requires the same, unique key.

The key serves as a security token for access to the locked area; locks are meant to only allow persons having the correct key to open it and gain access. In more complex mechanical lock/key systems, two different keys, one of which is known as the master key, serve to open the lock. Common metals include brass, plated brass, nickel silver, and steel. The act of opening a lock without a key is called lock picking.

== History ==
=== Premodern history ===

Locks have been in use for over 6000 years, with one early example discovered in the ruins of Nineveh, the capital of ancient Assyria. Locks such as this were developed into the Egyptian wooden pin lock, which consisted of a bolt, door fixture or attachment, and key. When the key was inserted, pins within the fixture were lifted out of drilled holes within the bolt, allowing it to move. When the key was removed, the pins fell part-way into the bolt, preventing movement.

The warded lock was also present from antiquity and remains the most recognizable lock and key design in the Western world. The first all-metal locks appeared between the years 870 and 900, and are attributed to English craftsmen. It is also said that the key was invented by Theodorus of Samos in the 6th century BC.

&#x27;The Romans invented metal locks and keys and the system of security provided by wards.&#x27;

Affluent Romans often kept their valuables in secure locked boxes within their households, and wore the keys as rings on their fingers. The practice had two benefits: It kept the key handy at all times, while signaling that the wearer was wealthy and important enough to have money and jewellery worth securing.

A special type of lock, dating back to the 17th–18th century, although potentially older as similar locks date back to the 14th century, can be found in the Beguinage of the Belgian city Lier. These locks are most likely Gothic locks, that were decorated with foliage, often in a V-shape surrounding the keyhole. They are often called &quot;drunk man&#x27;s lock&quot;, as these locks were, according to certain sources, designed in such a way a person can still find the keyhole in the dark, although this might not be the case as the ornaments might have been purely aesthetic. In more recent times similar locks have been designed.

===Modern locks===

With the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century and the concomitant development of precision engineering and component standardization, locks and keys were manufactured with increasing complexity and sophistication.

The lever tumbler lock, which uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock, was invented by Robert Barron in 1778. His double acting lever lock required the lever to be lifted to a certain height by having a slot cut in the lever, so lifting the lever too far was as bad as not lifting the lever far enough. This type of lock is still used today.
The lever tumbler lock was greatly improved by Jeremiah Chubb in 1818. A burglary in Portsmouth Dockyard prompted the British Government to announce a competition to produce a lock that could be opened only with its own key. Chubb developed the Chubb detector lock, which incorporated an integral security feature that could frustrate unauthorized access attempts and would indicate to the lock&#x27;s owner if it had been interfered with. Chubb was awarded £100 after a trained lock-picker failed to break the lock after 3 months.

In 1820, Jeremiah joined his brother Charles in starting their own lock company, Chubb. Chubb made various improvements to his lock: his 1824 improved design did not require a special regulator key to reset the lock; by 1847 his keys used six levers rather than four; and he later introduced a disc that allowed the key to pass but narrowed the field of view, hiding the levers from anybody attempting to pick the lock. The Chubb brothers also received a patent for the first burglar-resisting safe and began production in 1835.

The designs of Barron and Chubb were based on the use of movable levers, but Joseph Bramah, a prolific inventor, developed an alternative method in 1784. His lock used a cylindrical key with precise notches along the surface; these moved the metal slides that impeded the turning of the bolt into an exact alignment, allowing the lock to open. The lock was at the limits of the precision manufacturing capabilities of the time and was said by its inventor to be unpickable. In the same year Bramah started the Bramah Locks company at 124 Piccadilly, and displayed the &quot;Challenge Lock&quot; in the window of his shop from 1790, challenging &quot;...the artist who can make an instrument that will pick or open this lock&quot; for the reward of £200. The challenge stood for over 67 years until, at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the American locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs was able to open the lock and, following some argument about the circumstances under which he had opened it, was awarded the prize. Hobbs&#x27; attempt required some 51 hours, spread over 16 days.

The earliest patent for a double-acting pin tumbler lock was granted to American physician Abraham O. Stansbury in England in 1805, but the modern version, still in use today, was invented by American Linus Yale Sr. in 1848. This lock design used pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. In 1861, Linus Yale Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s pin-tumbler lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today. The modern Yale lock is essentially a more developed version of the Egyptian lock.

Despite some improvement in key design since, the majority of locks today are still variants of the designs invented by Bramah, Chubb and Yale.

===With physical keys===

A warded lock uses a set of obstructions, or wards, to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has notches or slots that correspond to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock. Warded locks are typically reserved for low-security applications as a well-designed skeleton key can successfully open a wide variety of warded locks.

The pin tumbler lock uses a set of pins to prevent the lock from opening unless the correct key is inserted. The key has a series of grooves on either side of the key&#x27;s blade that limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock, the horizontal grooves on the blade align with the wards in the keyway allowing or denying entry to the cylinder. A series of pointed teeth and notches on the blade, called bittings, then allow pins to move up and down until they are in line with the shear line of the inner and outer cylinder, allowing the cylinder or cam to rotate freely and the lock to open. An additional pin called the master pin is present between the key and driver pins in locks that accept master keys, to allow the plug to rotate at multiple pin elevations.

A wafer tumbler lock is similar to the pin tumbler lock and works on a similar principle. However, unlike the pin lock (where each pin consists of two or more pieces) each wafer is a single piece. The wafer tumbler lock is often incorrectly referred to as a disc tumbler lock, which uses an entirely different mechanism. The wafer lock is relatively inexpensive to produce and is often used in automobiles and cabinetry.

The disc tumbler lock or Abloy lock is composed of slotted rotating detainer discs.

The lever tumbler lock uses a set of levers to prevent the bolt from moving in the lock. In its simplest form, lifting the tumbler above a certain height will allow the bolt to slide past. Lever locks are commonly recessed inside wooden doors or on some older forms of padlocks, including fire brigade padlocks.

A magnetic keyed lock is a locking mechanism whereby the key utilizes magnets as part of the locking and unlocking mechanism. A magnetic key would use from one to many small magnets oriented so that the North and South poles would equate to a combination to push or pull the lock&#x27;s internal tumblers thus releasing the lock.

===With electronic keys===
An electronic lock works by means of an electric current and is usually connected to an access control system. In addition to the pin and tumbler used in standard locks, electronic locks connect the bolt or cylinder to a motor within the door using a part called an actuator. Types of electronic locks include the following:

A keycard lock operates with a flat card of similar dimensions as a credit card. In order to open the door, one needs to successfully match the signature within the &quot;keycard&quot;.

The lock in a typical remote keyless system operates with a smart key radio transmitter. The lock typically accepts a particular valid code only once, and the smart key transmits a different rolling code every time the button is pressed.
Generally the car door can be opened with either a valid code by radio transmission, or with a (non-electronic) pin tumbler key.
The ignition switch may require a transponder car key to both open a pin tumbler lock and also transmit a valid code by radio transmission.

A smart lock is an electromechanics lock that gets instructions to lock and unlock the door from an authorized device using a cryptographic key and wireless protocol. Smart locks have begun to be used more commonly in residential areas, often controlled with smartphones. Smart locks are used in coworking spaces and offices to enable keyless office entry. In addition, electronic locks cannot be picked with conventional tools.

== Locksmithing ==
Locksmithing is a traditional trade, and in most countries requires completion of an apprenticeship. The level of formal education required varies from country to country, from no qualifications required at all in the UK, to a simple training certificate awarded by an employer, to a full diploma from an engineering college. Locksmiths may be commercial (working out of a storefront), mobile (working out of a vehicle), institutional, or investigational (forensic locksmiths). They may specialize in one aspect of the skill, such as an automotive lock specialist, a master key system specialist or a safe technician. Many also act as security consultants, but not all security consultants have the skills and knowledge of a locksmith.

Historically, locksmiths constructed or repaired an entire lock, including its constituent parts. The rise of cheap mass production has made this less common; the vast majority of locks are repaired through like-for-like replacements, high-security safes and strongboxes being the most common exception. Many locksmiths also work on any existing door hardware, including door closers, hinges, electric strikes, and frame repairs, or service electronic locks by making keys for transponder-equipped vehicles and implementing access control systems.

Although the fitting and replacement of keys remains an important part of locksmithing, modern locksmiths are primarily involved in the installation of high quality lock-sets and the design, implementation, and management of keying and key control systems. Locksmiths are frequently required to determine the level of risk to an individual or institution and then recommend and implement appropriate combinations of equipment and policies to create a &quot;security layer&quot; that exceeds the reasonable gain of an intruder.

===Key duplication===

Traditional key cutting is the primary method of key duplication. It is a subtractive process named after the metalworking process of cutting, where a flat &quot;blank&quot; key is ground down to form the same shape as the &quot;template&quot; (original) key. The process roughly follows these stages:
# The original key is fitted into a vise in a machine, with a blank attached to a parallel vise which is mechanically linked.
# The original key is moved along a guide in a movement which follows the key&#x27;s shape, while the blank is moved in the same pattern against a cutting wheel by the mechanical linkage between the vices.
# After cutting, the new key is deburred by scrubbing it with a metal brush to remove particles of metal which could be dangerously sharp and foul locks.

Modern key cutting replaces the mechanical key following aspect with a process in which the original key is scanned electronically, processed by software, stored, then used to guide a cutting wheel when a key is produced. The capability to store electronic copies of the key&#x27;s shape allows for key shapes to be stored for key cutting by any party that has access to the key image.

Different key cutting machines are more or less automated, using different milling or grinding equipment, and follow the design of early 20th century key duplicators.

Key duplication is available in many retail hardware stores and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct key blank may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.
==Keyhole==
A keyhole (or keyway) is a hole or aperture (as in a door or lock) for receiving a key. Lock keyway shapes vary widely with lock manufacturer, and many manufacturers have a number of unique profiles requiring a specifically milled key blank to engage the lock&#x27;s tumblers.

== Symbolism ==

===Heraldry===

Keys appear in various symbols and coats of arms, the best-known being that of the Holy See: derived from the phrase in Matthew 16:19 which promises Saint Peter, in Roman Catholic tradition the first pope, the Keys of Heaven. But this is by no means the only case.

===Artwork===
Some works of art associate keys with the Greek goddess of witchcraft, known as Hecate.

===Palestinian key===
The Palestinian key is the Palestinian collective symbol of their homes lost in the Nakba, when more than half of the population of Mandatory Palestine was expelled or fled violence in 1948 and were subsequently refused the right to return. Since 2016, a Palestinian restaurant in Doha, Qatar, holds the Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s largest key – 2.7 tonnes and 7.8 × 3 meters.

<text>Craig Lawrence Kilborn (born August 24, 1962) is an American television host, actor, comedian, and sports commentator. Kilborn began a career in sports broadcasting in the late 1980s, leading to an anchoring position at ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; from 1993 to 1996. He was later the first host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, which he hosted from 1996 to 1998, and succeeded Tom Snyder on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; from 1999 to 2004. In comedy, Kilborn is known for his deadpan delivery.

==Early life==
Kilborn was born on August 24, 1962, in Kansas City, Missouri. His father, Hiram Kilborn, was an insurance executive, and his mother, Shirley, was a schoolteacher. When Kilborn was four years old, he and his family moved to Hastings, Minnesota, where he was raised. Kilborn was taller than his peers from an early age, eventually growing to , becoming a standout on the playground basketball court as he got older. In the ninth grade, Kilborn was recruited by the Northside Magicians, an all-star basketball team in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He excelled with the Magicians and with the Hastings High School basketball team, ultimately earning three letters and multiple all-conference and all-state honors.

After graduating from high school, Kilborn accepted a scholarship to play basketball for Montana State University, where he earned dual bachelor&#x27;s degrees in media and theater arts in 1985 and has joked he &quot;led the Big Sky Conference in turnovers&quot; and also bench pressed while training.

==Career==
===Media===
Kilborn began in radio, as the CBA Savannah Spirits&#x27;s play-by-play radio commentator in 1986 and 1987. He later began his television career in California as the sports anchor for Monterey County&#x27;s Fox affiliate KCBA in Salinas. Some of his early on-air work included covering the Gilroy Garlic Festival and playing bocce with the locals near Cannery Row. Kilborn lived in nearby Carmel-by-the-Sea.

====&quot;SportsCenter&quot;====

After several small jobs, Kilborn became an ESPN &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor from 1993 to 1996. He was primarily the anchor of the late broadcast of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; which he coined &quot;The Feel Good Edition&quot;. His numerous catch phrases included &quot;Release, Rotation, Splash&quot;, &quot;Jumanji&quot;, and &quot;Oh, Precious&quot;. He made a return appearance to &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on August 8, 2004, when he co-hosted &quot;SportsCenter&quot; with Dan Patrick during ESPN&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Celebration.

===Late-night hosting===
====&quot;The Daily Show&quot;====

In 1996, Kilborn became host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; on Comedy Central. During his three-year tenure, &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was named &quot;Best Late Night Comedy&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Kilborn was also nominated for a CableACE Award for Outstanding Entertainment Host. Some recurring features Kilborn created at &quot;The Daily Show&quot; included: &quot;5 Questions&quot;, &quot;Moment for Us&quot;, &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance&quot;, and &quot;Your Moment of Zen&quot; (later hosts would continue to use the latter feature).

In a 1997 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Kilborn made jokes regarding &quot;Daily Show&quot; head writer Lizz Winstead, saying, &quot;To be honest, Lizz does find me very attractive. If I wanted her to blow me, she would.&quot; Kilborn apologized publicly and pointed out that the remarks were &quot;said in jest&quot;, but he was suspended for a week.

In 1998, CBS and David Letterman&#x27;s production company, Worldwide Pants, selected Kilborn to replace Tom Snyder as host of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to run after &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. His final &quot;Daily Show&quot; episode aired on December 17, 1998, ending a 386-episode tenure. On January 11, 1999, Jon Stewart replaced Kilborn as host of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. By the time of Kilborn&#x27;s departure, only one original correspondent, Beth Littleford, stayed with Stewart. She would depart in May 2000.

On Jon Stewart&#x27;s last &quot;Daily Show&quot; episode August 6, 2015, Kilborn made a cameo appearance as &quot;Host Emeritus&quot;. It was his first appearance on the show since he left as host.

In a 2020 interview with &quot;The Athletic&quot;, Kilborn reflected on his time on &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, stating that he &quot;had a blast&quot; doing the show and that he was &quot;living in New York City, hosting a comedy show, and sipping martinis at the illustrious 21 Club.&quot; He also said he &quot;wasn&#x27;t hired at Comedy Central to do a politics-heavy show, and he &quot;would never do one — I have no interest.&quot; Kilborn credited &quot;The Daily Show&quot; for leading him to his dream job of hosting a traditional late-night show. He also said, &quot;&quot;The Daily Show&quot; was innocently set up in a different way — they didn&#x27;t hire the host first – so we inherited each other. Fortunately, most of the people were a good fit and supportive. But as much as I enjoyed it, I was always a short timer. It wasn&#x27;t my show, and I wanted to do a network traditional hour format as opposed to a half-hour news parody.&quot;

====&quot;The Late Late Show&quot;====

Kilborn hosted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; for five years, changing the format to appeal to a younger audience. On the show, he popularized segments such as &quot;Yambo&quot; and &quot;5 Questions&quot;. He created several characters, including Sebastian, the Asexual Icon. He also narrated his own introduction and would enter to the sound of the song &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot; at the beginning of his show.

In August 2004, Kilborn elected not to extend his contract. In a 2010 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Kilborn said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t leave to do anything else, I left to leave. I achieved my career goals and it wasn&#x27;t all it was cracked up to be&quot;, and adding that he believed the late night timeslot to be &quot;crowded&quot;, and &quot;the formats repetitive&quot;. Kilborn later stated in a 2019 interview with the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, &quot;The main reason I left &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; was creatively I lost interest in late night comedy. The other reason was that the business side of that particular show was excessively flawed so I escaped the silliness,&quot; adding that he had &quot;developed a specific, aristocratic comedic sensibility that didn&#x27;t mesh with late night.&quot;

In a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation, World Wide Pants executive Peter Lassally indicated that Kilborn left the show &quot;because he didn&#x27;t get the raise he wanted.&quot; However, Kilborn stated in a 2004 interview with &quot;Daily Variety&quot; that &quot;[&quot;The Late Late Show&quot;] was easily the greatest job I&#x27;ve had, and CBS was very generous in their offer to re-sign me.&quot;

Kilborn&#x27;s last episode of &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; aired on August 27, 2004. The Scottish comedian Craig Ferguson took over the show on January 3, 2005.&quot;

====&quot;The Kilborn File&quot;====
Craig Kilborn returned to television on June 28, 2010 after six years off the air, when his new half-hour show &quot;The Kilborn File&quot; debuted on select Fox stations. The show aired for a six-week test run on a 7:00pm time slot in most markets, but was not well received. Christine Lakin was his sidekick. The show brought back many of the hallmark segments from his time on &quot;The Daily Show&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show,&quot; such as &quot;5 Questions&quot; and a segment similar to &quot;Yambo&quot; (with some minor rule changes and a name change to &quot;Kilbo&quot; and later to &quot;Kilbyashi&quot;). The show was not renewed.

===Other work===
In the movie &quot;Old School&quot; (2003), Kilborn played Mark, the philandering boyfriend of Ellen Pompeo&#x27;s character. In the 2006 film &quot;The Benchwarmers&quot;, he played Jerry, the bully to Jon Heder, David Spade, and Rob Schneider&#x27;s nerdy roles. In 2011, Kilborn played the villain in an episode of &quot;Chuck&quot; during its final season.

Kilborn guest hosted &quot;The Artie Lange Show&quot; on November 6–8, 2013.

He appeared in a TV commercial for Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese in 2016.

Since 2022, Kilborn has hosted a podcast entitled &quot;The Life Gorgeous&quot;.

<text>The Mission is a 1986 British historical drama film about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th-century South America. Directed by Roland Joffé and written by Robert Bolt, the film stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi, and Liam Neeson.

The film premiered in competition at the 39th Cannes Film Festival, winning the Palme d&#x27;Or. At the 59th Academy Awards it was nominated for seven awards including Best Picture and Best Director, winning for Best Cinematography. The film has also been cited as one of the greatest religious films of all time, appearing in the Vatican film list&#x27;s &quot;Religion&quot; section and being number one on the &quot;Church Times&quot;″ Top 50 Religious Films list.

==Plot==
In the 1750s, Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the eastern Paraguayan jungle to convert the Guaraní to Christianity. He sends another priest to make contact with them, but the man is thrown to his death off Iguazu Falls. Father Gabriel travels to the falls himself and plays his oboe. One of the Guaraní grabs the oboe from his hands and breaks it in half. Father Gabriel does not react, and the remaining Guaraní, captivated by the music, take him to their village.

Captain Rodrigo Mendoza is a mercenary and slave trader, and a guest of the Spanish governor, Don Cabeza. His fiancée Carlotta confesses that she is in love with his half-brother Felipe. Mendoza catches them sleeping together and kills Felipe in a duel, an act that leaves him riddled with guilt. Father Gabriel, a friend of the governor&#x27;s, challenges Mendoza to undergo penance. Mendoza is forced to accompany the Jesuits to their mission, all the while dragging his armor and sword behind him. The natives recognise their persecutor, but soon forgive a tearful Mendoza. Father Gabriel&#x27;s mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaraní. Moved by the Guaraní&#x27;s acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help, and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit.

With the protection offered under Spanish law, the Jesuit missions have been safe. The newly signed Treaty of Madrid reapportions land on which the missions are located, transferring it to the Portuguese. The Portuguese have no interest in converting the natives, viewing them as animals fit only for slavery. Aware that the Jesuits would likely oppose such efforts, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a Jesuit, is sent to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain.

Under pressure from both Cabeza and the Portuguese emissary Hontar, Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if in favour of the missions, the Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese, and the Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their success in converting the native peoples. At Father Gabriel&#x27;s mission, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the missions and instructs the Guaraní that they must leave because &quot;it is God&#x27;s will.&quot; The Guaraní question this and argue that God&#x27;s will is to develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission even at the cost of their lives. They are, however, divided on how to do this. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, by contrast, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the mission. Against Father Gabriel&#x27;s wishes, he teaches the Guarani the European art of war.

When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, Mendoza and a Guaraní militia resist them. Their heroic defense is quickly overcome by the superior weaponry and numbers of the enemy, and Mendoza is killed along with his men. The soldiers encounter the Jesuits of the mission leading the Guaraní women and children singing in a religious procession. Father Gabriel is at the head, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament. The colonial forces organize a firing line and discharge their guns directly into the procession, killing the priests. After Father Gabriel dies, a Guaraní man picks up the Blessed Sacrament and continues leading the procession. Most of the natives are subsequently captured to be sold as slaves, but a small group of children manage to escape into the jungle.

In a final exchange between Altamirano and Hontar, the latter notes that what has happened was unfortunate but inevitable: &quot;We must work in the world; the world is thus.&quot; Altamirano rejoins: &quot;No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.&quot; Days later, a canoe carrying the surviving children returns to the now pillaged and burned mission, retrieving their belongings. They set off up the river, going deeper into the jungle, with the thought that the events will remain in their memories. A final title declares that many priests have continued to fight for the rights of indigenous people into the present day. The text of John 1:5 is displayed: &quot;The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness hath not overcome it.&quot;

==Cast==
==Historical basis==
&quot;The Mission&quot; is based on events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, in which Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. A significant subtext is the impending suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film&#x27;s narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who is himself a Jesuit. Altamirano, speaking in hindsight in 1758, corresponds to the actual Andalusian Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano, who was sent by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to transfer territory from Spain to Portugal. He oversaw the transfer of seven missions south and east of the Río Uruguay, that had been settled by Guaraní and Jesuits in the 17th century. As compensation, Spain promised each mission 4,000 pesos, that is fewer than 1 peso for each of the approximately 30,000 Guaraní of the seven missions, while the cultivated lands, livestock, and buildings were estimated to be worth 7–16 million pesos. The film&#x27;s climax is the Guaraní War of 1754–1756, during which historical Guaraní defended their homes against Spanish-Portuguese forces implementing the Treaty of Madrid. For the film, a re-creation was made of one of the seven missions, São Miguel das Missões.

Father Gabriel&#x27;s character is loosely based on the life of Paraguayan saint and Jesuit Roque González de Santa Cruz. The story is taken from the book &quot;The Lost Cities of Paraguay&quot; by Father C. J. McNaspy, S.J., who was also a consultant on the film.

The waterfall setting of the film suggests the combination of these events with the story of older missions, founded between 1610 and 1630 on the Paranapanema River above the Guaíra Falls, from which Paulista slave raids forced Guaraní and Jesuits to flee in 1631. The battle at the end of the film evokes the eight-day Battle of Mbororé in 1641, a battle fought on land as well as in boats on rivers, in which the Jesuit-organised, firearm-equipped Guaraní forces stopped the Paulista raiders.

===Historical accuracy===
The historical Altamirano was not a cardinal sent by the Pope, but an emissary sent by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Ignacio Visconti, to preserve the Jesuits in Europe in the face of attacks in Spain and Portugal.

James Schofield Saeger has many objections to the portrayal of the Guaraní in the movie. The film in his opinion is a &quot;white European distortion of Native American reality.&quot; Native Americans are treated as &quot;mission furniture.&quot; The film asserts that the Guaraní accepted Christianity immediately, although in reality native religious beliefs persisted for several generations. He believes the movie glosses over the frequent resistance by Guaraní to Jesuit authority as witnessed by several revolts and the refusal of many Guaraní to live in the missions. The movie also portrays the Jesuits engaged in armed resistance to Spanish attempts to force the missions to relocate in the 1750s. In reality, the revolt was carried out by the Guaraní &quot;after&quot; the Jesuits had turned over control of the missions to the colonial governments of Spain and Portugal. Indeed, the Jesuits are noted in the film as having ordered the Guaraní to turn over their weapons and submit. The Guaraní defied these orders and embarked on an armed, but ultimately unsuccessful revolt. However, several individual Jesuits did choose to stay in the missions with the Guaraní during their suppression by the colonials and the Spanish and Portuguese accused them of inciting the Guaraní to resist.

==Filming locations==
The film was mostly filmed in Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The tunnels of Fort Amherst in Kent were used as part of the monastery where Mendoza (Robert De Niro) sequesters himself after murdering his brother.

Bodyguards had to be hired to protect Robert De Niro, as the Medellín Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, had threatened to kill any Americans found in Colombia, in retaliation for the Drug Enforcement Administration&#x27;s cracking down on drug traffickers.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack for &quot;The Mission&quot; was written by Ennio Morricone. Beginning with a liturgical piece (&quot;On Earth as It Is in Heaven&quot;) which becomes the &#x27;Spanish&#x27; theme, it moves quickly to the &#x27;Guaraní&#x27; theme, which is written in a heavily native style and uses several indigenous instruments. Later, Morricone defines &quot;The Mission&quot; theme as a duet between the &#x27;Spanish&#x27; and &quot;Guaraní&quot; themes. The soundtrack was recorded at CTS Lansdowne Studios in London.

Other themes throughout the movie include the &#x27;Penance&#x27;, &#x27;Conquest&#x27;, and &#x27;Ave Maria Guaraní&#x27; themes. In the latter, a large choir of indigenous people sing a rendition of the &quot;Ave Maria&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $17.2 million at the US and international box office against a budget of £16.5 million, which at the time was the US equivalent of $25.4 million, making this film a commercial disappointment.

Goldcrest Films invested £15,130,000 in the film and received £12,250,000 in returns, netting Goldcrest a £2,880,000 loss.

===Critical===
&quot;The Mission&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 63% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Mission&quot; is a well-meaning epic given delicate heft by its sumptuous visuals and a standout score by Ennio Morricone, but its staid presentation never stirs an emotional investment in its characters.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Robert De Niro would later say of &quot;The Mission&quot;, &quot;I thought it was a really wonderful, meaningful story... The idea of this man changing appealed to me a lot. It was an amazing experience and I liked Roland Joffé a lot. He&#x27;s a good director with a lot of heart. Some people thought it was ponderous but I thought it was a wonderful movie. I&#x27;m partial, and I don&#x27;t usually say that, but I thought it was.&quot;

<text>The Mitsubishi A5M, formal Japanese Navy designation , experimental Navy designation Mitsubishi Navy Experimental 9-&quot;Shi&quot; Carrier Fighter, company designation Mitsubishi &quot;Ka&quot;-14, was a WWII-era Japanese carrier-based fighter aircraft. The Type number is from the last two digits of the Japanese imperial year 2596 (1936) when it entered service with the Imperial Navy.

It was the world&#x27;s first low-wing monoplane shipboard fighter to enter service and the predecessor of the famous Mitsubishi A6M &quot;Zero&quot;. The Allied reporting name was Claude.

==Design and development==
In 1934, the Imperial Japanese Navy prepared a specification for an advanced fighter, requiring a maximum speed of at and able to climb to in 6.5 minutes. This 9-&quot;shi&quot; (1934) specification produced designs from both Mitsubishi and Nakajima.

Mitsubishi assigned the task of designing the new fighter to a team led by Jiro Horikoshi (original creator of the similar but unsuccessful Mitsubishi 1MF10, and later responsible for the famous A6M Zero). The resulting design, designated Ka-14 by Mitsubishi, was an all-metal low-wing fighter, with a thin elliptical inverted gull wing and a fixed undercarriage, which was chosen as the increase in performance (estimated as 10% in drag, but only a mere 3% increase in maximum speed) arising from use of a retractable undercarriage was not felt to justify the extra weight. The first prototype, powered by a 447 kW (600 hp) Nakajima Kotobuki 5 radial engine, flew on 4 February 1935. The aircraft far exceeded the requirements of the specification, with a maximum speed of being reached. The second prototype was fitted with a revised, ungulled wing, and after various changes to maximize maneuverability and reduce drag, was ordered into production as the A5M.

With the Ka-14 demonstrating excellent performance, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force ordered a single modified prototype for evaluation as the Ki-18. While this demonstrated similar performance to the Navy aircraft and hence was far faster than the IJAAF&#x27;s current fighter, the Kawasaki Ki-10 biplane, the type was rejected by the army owing to its reduced maneuverability. The Army then produced a specification for an improved advanced fighter to replace the Ki-10. Mitsubishi, busy turning the Ka-14 into the A5M, submitted a minimally changed aircraft as the Ki-33, this being defeated by Nakajima&#x27;s competing aircraft, which was ordered into service as the Ki-27.

==Operational history==
The aircraft entered service in early 1937, and soon saw action in aerial battles at the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, including air-to-air battles with the Republic of China Air Force&#x27;s Boeing P-26C Model 281 &quot;Peashooters&quot; in the world&#x27;s first aerial dogfighting and kills between monoplane fighters built of mostly metal. The A5M replaced the Nakajima A4N1 in service, a biplane fighter aircraft.
Chinese Nationalist pilots, primarily flying the Curtiss Hawk III, fought against the Japanese, but the A5M was the better of almost every fighter aircraft it encountered. Though armed with only a pair of machine-guns, the new fighter proved effective and damage-tolerant, with excellent manoeuvrability and robust construction. Later on A5M&#x27;s also provided much-needed escorts for the then-modern but vulnerable Mitsubishi G3M bombers.

The Mitsubishi team continued to improve the A5M, working through versions until the final A5M4, which carried an external underside drop tank to provide fuel for extended range.

The A5M&#x27;s most competitive adversary in the air was the Polikarpov I-16, a fast and heavily armed fighter flown by both Chinese Air Force regulars and Soviet volunteers. Air battles in 1938, especially on 18 February and 29 April, ranked among the largest air battles ever fought at the time. The battle of 29 April saw 67 Polikarpov fighters (31 I-16s and 36 I-15 bis) against 18 G3Ms escorted by 27 A5Ms. Each side claimed victory: the Chinese/Soviet side claimed 21 Japanese aircraft (11 fighters and 10 bombers) shot down with 50 Japanese airmen killed and two captured having bailed out while losing 12 aircraft and 5 pilots killed; the Japanese claimed they lost only two G3Ms and two A5Ms shot down with over 40 Chinese aircraft shot down.

104 A5M aircraft were modified to accommodate a two-seater cockpit. This version, used for pilot training, was dubbed the A5M4-K. K version aircraft continued to be used for pilot training long after standard A5Ms left front-line service.

Almost all A5Ms had open cockpits. A closed cockpit was tried but found little favor among Navy aviators. All had fixed, non-retractable undercarriage. Wheel spats were a feature of standard fighters but not training aircraft.

The Flying Tigers encountered the Type 96, although not officially, and one was shot down at Mingaladon airfield, Burma on 29 January 1942.

Some A5Ms remained in service at the end of 1941, when the United States entered World War II in the Pacific. US intelligence sources believed the A5M still served as Japan&#x27;s primary Navy fighter, when in fact the A6M Zero had replaced it on first-line aircraft carriers and with the Tainan Kōkūtai in Taiwan. Other Japanese carriers and Kōkūtai (air groups) continued to use the A5M until production of the Zero caught up with demand. On 1 February 1942, the US carrier &quot;USS Enterprise&quot; launched air strikes at Japanese air and naval bases on Roi and Kwajalein Atolls in the Marshall Islands. During these actions, Mitsubishi A5Ms shot down three Douglas SBD dive bombers, including the aircraft of LtCdr. Halstead Hopping, commanding officer of VS-6 Squadron. The last combat actions with the A5M as a fighter took place at the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May 1942, when two A5Ms and four A6Ms of the Japanese carrier fought against US aircraft that sank their carrier.

In the closing months of the war, most remaining A5M airframes were used for &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks.

<doc id="525496" wikidata="Q648304" url="?curid=525496" title="Tintin in the Land of the Soviets">
<text>Tintin in the Land of the Soviets () is the first volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper as anti-communist satire for its children&#x27;s supplement , it was serialised weekly from January 1929 to May 1930 before being published in a collected volume by Éditions du Petit Vingtième in 1930. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are sent to the Soviet Union to report on Stalin&#x27;s government. Knowing of his intentions, however, the secret police of the OGPU are sent to hunt him down.

Bolstered by publicity stunts, &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; was a commercial success in Belgium, and also witnessed serialisation in France and Switzerland. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot;, and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Damage to the original plates prevented republication of the book for several decades, while Hergé later expressed embarrassment at the crudeness of the work. As he began to redraw his earlier &quot;Adventures&quot; in second, colour versions from 1942 onward, he decided against doing so for &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;; it was the only completed &quot;Tintin&quot; story that Hergé did not reproduce in colour. Growing demand among fans of the series resulted in the production of unauthorised copies of the book in the 1960s, with the first officially sanctioned republication appearing in 1969, after which it was translated into several other languages, including English. Critical reception of the work has been largely negative, and several commentators on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; have described &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; as one of Hergé&#x27;s weakest works.

== Synopsis ==

Tintin, a reporter for , is sent with his dog Snowy on an assignment to the Soviet Union, departing from Brussels. En route to Moscow, an agent of the OGPU—the Soviet secret police—sabotages the train and declares the reporter to be a &quot;dirty little bourgeois&quot;. The Berlin Police indirectly blame Tintin for the bombing but he escapes to the border of the Soviet Union. Following closely, the OGPU agent finds Tintin and brings him before the local Commissar&#x27;s office, instructing the Commissar to make the reporter &quot;disappear ... accidentally&quot;. Escaping again, Tintin finds &quot;how the Soviets fool the poor idiots who still believe in a Red Paradise&quot; by burning bundles of straw and clanging metal in order to trick visiting English Marxists into believing that non-operational Soviet factories are productive.

Tintin witnesses a local election, where the Bolsheviks threaten the voters to ensure their own victory; when they try to arrest him, he dresses as a ghost to scare them away. Tintin attempts to make his way out of the Soviet Union, but the Bolsheviks pursue and arrest him, then threaten him with torture. Escaping his captors, Tintin reaches Moscow, remarking that the Bolsheviks have turned it into &quot;a stinking slum&quot;. He and Snowy observe a government official handing out bread to homeless Marxists but denying it to their opponents; Snowy steals a loaf and gives it to a starving boy. Spying on a secret Bolshevik meeting, Tintin learns that all the Soviet grain is being exported abroad for propaganda purposes, leaving the people starving, and that the government plans to &quot;organise an expedition against the kulaks, the rich peasants, and force them at gunpoint to give us their corn&quot;.

Tintin infiltrates the Red Army and warns some of the kulaks to hide their grain, but the army catches him and sentences him to death by firing squad. By planting blanks in the soldiers&#x27; rifles, Tintin fakes his death and is able to make his way into the snowy wilderness, where he discovers an underground Bolshevik hideaway in a haunted house. A Bolshevik then captures him and informs him, &quot;You&#x27;re in the hideout where Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin have collected together wealth stolen from the people!&quot; With Snowy&#x27;s help, Tintin escapes, commandeers a plane, and flies into the night. The plane crashes, but Tintin fashions a new propeller from a tree using a penknife, and continues to Berlin. The OGPU agents appear and lock Tintin in a dungeon, but he escapes with the aid of Snowy, who has dressed himself in a tiger costume. The last OGPU agent attempts to kidnap Tintin, but this attempt is foiled, leaving the agent threatening, &quot;We&#x27;ll blow up all the capitals of Europe with dynamite!&quot; Tintin returns to Brussels amidst a huge popular reception.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Georges Remi—best known under the pen name Hergé—had been employed as an illustrator at (&quot;The Twentieth Century&quot;), a staunchly Roman Catholic and conservative Belgian newspaper based in Hergé&#x27;s native Brussels. Run by the Abbé Norbert Wallez, the paper described itself as a &quot;Catholic Newspaper for Doctrine and Information&quot; and disseminated a far-right and fascist viewpoint; Wallez was an admirer of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and kept a signed picture of him on his desktop, while Léon Degrelle, who later became the leader of the fascist Rexists, worked as a foreign correspondent for the paper. According to Harry Thompson, such political ideas were common in Belgium at the time, and Hergé&#x27;s milieu was permeated with conservative ideas revolving around &quot;patriotism, Catholicism, strict morality, discipline, and naivety&quot;. Anti-communist sentiment was strong, and a Soviet exhibition held in Brussels in January 1928 was vandalised amid demonstrations by the fascist National Youth Movement (&quot;Jeunesses nationales&quot;) in which Degrelle took part.

Wallez appointed Hergé editor of a children&#x27;s supplement for the Thursday issues of , titled (&quot;&quot;The Little Twentieth&quot;). Propagating Wallez&#x27;s socio-political views to its young readership, it contained explicitly pro-fascist and anti-Semitic sentiment. In addition to editing the supplement, Hergé illustrated (&quot;The Extraordinary Adventures of Flup, Nénesse, Poussette and Cochonnet&quot;), a comic strip authored by a member of the newspaper&#x27;s sport staff, which told the adventures of two boys, one of their little sisters, and her inflatable rubber pig. Hergé became dissatisfied with mere illustration work, and wanted to write and draw his own cartoon strip.

Hergé already had experience creating comic strips. From July 1926 he had written a strip about a boy scout patrol leader titled &quot;Les Aventures de Totor C.P. des Hannetons&quot; (&quot;The Adventures of Totor, Scout Leader of the Cockchafers&quot;) for the Scouting newspaper (&quot;The Belgian Boy Scout&quot;&quot;). The character of Totor was a strong influence on Tintin; Hergé described the latter as being like Totor&#x27;s younger brother. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier stated that graphically, Totor and Tintin were &quot;virtually identical&quot; except for the scout uniform, also noting many similarities between their respective adventures, particularly in the illustration style, the fast pace of the story, and the use of humour. Hergé also had experience creating anti-communist propaganda, having produced a number of satirical sketches for &quot;Le Sifflet&quot; in October 1928 titled &quot;70 per cent of Communist chefs are odd ducks&quot;.

=== Influences ===
Hergé wanted to set Tintin&#x27;s first adventure in the United States in order to involve Native Americans—a people who had fascinated him since boyhood—in the story. Wallez rejected this idea, which later saw realisation as the series&#x27; third instalment, &quot;Tintin in America&quot; (1932). Instead, Wallez wanted Hergé to send Tintin to the Soviet Union, founded in 1922 by the Marxist–Leninist Bolshevik Party after seizing power from the Russian Empire during the 1917 October Revolution. The Bolsheviks greatly changed the country&#x27;s feudal society by nationalising industry and replacing a capitalist economy with a socialist one. By the early 1920s, the Soviet Union&#x27;s first leader, Vladimir Lenin, had died and been succeeded by Joseph Stalin. Being both Roman Catholic and politically right-wing, Wallez was opposed to the atheist, anti-sectarian, anti-theocratic and left-wing Soviet policies, and wanted Tintin&#x27;s first adventure to reflect this, to persuade its young readers with anti-Marxist and anti-communist ideas. Later commenting on why he produced a work of propaganda, Hergé said that he had been &quot;inspired by the atmosphere of the paper&quot;, which taught him that being a Catholic meant being anti-Marxist, and since childhood he had been horrified by the Bolshevik shooting of the Romanov family in July 1918.

Hergé did not have the time to visit the Soviet Union or to analyse any available published information about it. Instead, he obtained an overview from a single book, (&quot;Moscow Unveiled: Nine Years&#x27; Work in the Land of the Soviets&quot;) by Joseph Douillet (1878–1954), a former Belgian consul to Rostov-on-Don who had spent nine years in Russia following the 1917 revolution. Published in both Belgium and France in 1928, sold well to a public eager to believe Douillet&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik claims, many of which were of doubtful accuracy. As Michael Farr noted, &quot;Hergé freely, though selectively, lifted whole scenes from Douillet&#x27;s account&quot;, including &quot;the chilling election episode&quot;, which was &quot;almost identical&quot; to Douillet&#x27;s description in . Hergé&#x27;s lack of knowledge about the Soviet Union led to many factual errors; the story contains references to bananas, Shell petrol and Huntley &amp; Palmers biscuits, none of which existed in the Soviet Union at the time. He also made errors in Russian names, typically adding the Polish ending &quot;-&quot; to them, rather than the Russian equivalent &quot;-&quot;.

In creating &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot;, Hergé was influenced by innovations within the comic strip medium. He claimed a strong influence from French cartoonist Alain Saint-Ogan, producer of the &quot;Zig et Puce&quot; series. The two met the following year, becoming lifelong friends. He was also influenced by the contemporary American comics that reporter Léon Degrelle had sent back to Belgium from Mexico, where he was stationed to report on the Cristero War. These American comics included George McManus&#x27;s &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot; and Rudolph Dirks&#x27;s &quot;Katzenjammer Kids&quot;. Farr believed that contemporary cinema influenced &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, indicating similarities between scenes in the book with the police chases of the &quot;Keystone Cops&quot; films, the train chase in Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;The General&quot; and with the expressionist images found in the works of directors such as Fritz Lang. Farr summarised this influence by commenting: &quot;As a pioneer of the strip cartoon, Hergé was not afraid to draw on one modern medium to develop another&quot;.

=== Publication ===
Prior to serialisation, an announcement ran in the 4 January 1929 edition of , proclaiming: &quot;e are always eager to satisfy our readers and keep them up to date on foreign affairs. We have therefore sent &quot;Tintin&quot;, one of our top reporters, to Soviet Russia&quot;. The illusion of Tintin as a real reporter for the paper, and not a fictional character, was emphasised by the claim that the comic strip was not a series of drawings, but composed of photographs taken of Tintin&#x27;s adventure. Biographer Benoît Peeters thought this a private joke between staff at ; alluding to the fact that Hergé had originally been employed as a photojournalist, a job that he never fulfilled. Literary critic Tom McCarthy later compared this approach to that of 18th-century European literature, which often presented fictional narratives as non-fiction.

The first instalment of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; appeared in the 10 January 1929 edition of , and ran weekly until 8 May 1930. Hergé did not plot out the storyline in advance; he improvised new situations on a weekly basis, leaving Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier to observe that both &quot;Story-wise and graphically, Hergé was learning his craft before our eyes.&quot; Hergé admitted that the work was rushed, saying: &quot;The came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn&#x27;t have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week&quot;. Michael Farr considered this evident, remarking that many drawings were &quot;crude, rudimentary, rushed&quot;, lacking the &quot;polish and refinement&quot; that Hergé would later develop. Contrastingly, he thought that certain plates were of the &quot;highest quality&quot; and exhibited Hergé&#x27;s &quot;outstanding ability as a draughtsman&quot;.

The story was an immediate success among its young readers. As Harry Thompson remarked, the plotline would have been popular with the average Belgian parent, exploiting their anti-communist sentiment and feeding their fears regarding the Russians. The series&#x27; popularity led Wallez to organise publicity stunts to boost interest. The first of these was the April Fools&#x27; Day publication of a faked letter purporting to be from the OGPU (Soviet secret police) confirming Tintin&#x27;s existence, and warning that if the paper did not cease publication of &quot;these attacks against the Soviets and the revolutionary proletariat of Russia, you will meet death very shortly&quot;.

The second was a staged publicity event, suggested by the reporter Charles Lesne, which took place on Thursday 8 May 1930. During the stunt, the 15-year-old Lucien Pepermans, a friend of Hergé&#x27;s who had Tintin&#x27;s features, arrived at Brussels&#x27; Gare du Nord railway station aboard the incoming Liège express from Moscow, dressed in Russian garb as Tintin and accompanied by a white dog; in later life Hergé erroneously claimed that he had accompanied Pepermans, whereas it had been Julien De Proft. A crowd of fans greeted Pepermans and De Proft and pulled the Tintin impersonator into their midst. Proceeding by limousine to the offices of , they were greeted by further crowds, largely of Catholic Boy Scouts; Pepermans gave a speech on the building&#x27;s balcony, before gifts were distributed to fans.

From 26 October 1930, &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; was syndicated to French Catholic magazine (&quot;Brave Hearts&quot;), recently founded by the Abbé Gaston Courtois. Courtois had travelled to Brussels to meet Wallez and Hergé, but upon publication thought that his readers would not understand the speech bubble system, adding explanatory sentences below each image. This angered Hergé, who unsuccessfully &quot;intervened passionately&quot; to stop the additions. The publication was highly significant for initiating Hergé&#x27;s international career. The story was also reprinted in its original form in &quot;L&#x27;écho illustré&quot;, a Swiss weekly magazine, from 1932 onward. Recognising the continued commercial viability of the story, Wallez published it in book form in September 1930 through the Brussels-based at a print run of 10,000, each sold at twenty francs. The first 500 copies were numbered and signed by Hergé using Tintin&#x27;s signature, with Snowy&#x27;s paw print drawn on by Wallez&#x27;s secretary, Germaine Kieckens, who later became Hergé&#x27;s first wife. For reasons unknown, the original book version omitted the page originally published in the 26 December 1929 edition of ; since the story&#x27;s republication in &quot;Archives Hergé&quot;, it has appeared in modern editions as page 97A.

In April 2012 an original copy of the first album was sold for a record price of €37,820 by specialised auctioneers Banque Dessinée of Elsene, with another copy being sold for €9,515. In October the same year a copy was sold at the same auction house for €17,690.

=== Later publications ===
By 1936 there was already a demand for reprints of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The cartoonist was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and that as a result he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.

From 1942 onwards, Hergé began redrawing and colouring his earlier &quot;Tintin&quot; adventures for Casterman, but chose not to do so for &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;, considering its story too crude. Embarrassed by it, he labeled it a &quot;transgression of [his] youth&quot;. Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier believed that another factor in his decision might have been the story&#x27;s virulently anti-Marxist theme, which would have been unpopular amidst growing West European sympathies for Marxism following the Second World War. In an article discussing Hergé&#x27;s work which was published in the magazine &quot;Jeune Afrique&quot; (&quot;Young Africa&quot;) in 1962, it was noted that despite the fact that fans of his work visited the Bibliothèque Nationale to read the copy of &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; that was held there, it &quot;will never (and with good cause) be republished&quot;. In 1961, Hergé wrote a letter to Casterman suggesting that the original version of the story be republished in a volume containing a publisher&#x27;s warning about its content. Louis-Robert Casterman replied with a letter in which he stated that while the subject had been discussed within the company: &quot;There are more hesitant or decidedly negative opinions than there are enthusiastic ones. Whatever the case, you can rest assured that the matter is being actively considered&quot;.

As &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; became more popular in Western Europe, and some of the rarer books became collectors&#x27; items, the original printed edition of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; became highly valued and unauthorized editions began to be produced. As a result, Studios Hergé published 500 numbered copies to mark the series&#x27; 40th birthday in 1969. This encouraged further demand, leading to the production of further &quot;mediocre-quality&quot; unlicensed editions, which were sold at &quot;very high prices&quot;. To stem this illegal trade, Hergé agreed to a 1973 republication as part of the collection, where it appeared in a collected volume alongside &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; and &quot;Tintin in America&quot;. With unofficial copies continuing to be sold, Casterman produced a facsimile edition of the original in 1981. Over the next decade, it was translated into nine languages, with an English-language edition translated by Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner published by Sundancer in 1989. This edition was republished in 1999 for the 70th anniversary of &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot;.

Sociologist John Theobald noted that by the 1980s, the book&#x27;s plot had become &quot;socially and politically acceptable&quot; in the western world as part of the Reaganite intensification of the Cold War and increased hostility towards Marxism and socialism. This cultural climate allowed it to appear &quot;on hypermarket shelves as suitable children&#x27;s literature for the new millennium&quot;. That same theme prevented its publication in Communist Party-governed China, where it was the only completed adventure not translated by Wang Bingdong and officially published in the early 21st century.

In 2017, two French colour versions were created by Casterman and Moulinsart.

== Critical reception ==
In his study of the cultural and literary legacy of Brussels, André De Vries remarked that &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; was &quot;crude by Hergé&#x27;s later standards, in every sense of the word&quot;. Simon Kuper of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; criticised both &quot;Land of the Soviets&quot; and &quot;Tintin in the Congo&quot; as the &quot;worst&quot; of the &quot;Adventures&quot;, being &quot;poorly drawn&quot; and &quot;largely plot-free&quot;. Sociologist John Theobald of the Southampton Institute argued that Hergé had no interest in providing factual information about the Soviet Union, but only wanted to inculcate his readers against Marxism, hence depicting the Bolsheviks rigging elections, killing opponents and stealing the grain from the people. According to literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès of Stanford University, Hergé cast the Bolsheviks as &quot;absolute evil&quot; but was unable to understand how they had risen to power, or what their political views were. This meant that Tintin did not know this either, thereby observing the Soviet &quot;world of misery&quot; and fighting Bolsheviks without being able to foment an effective counter-revolution. Literary critic Tom McCarthy described the plot as &quot;fairly straightforward&quot; and criticised the depiction of Bolsheviks as &quot;pantomime cut-outs&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters was critical of the opening pages to the story, believing that the illustrations in it were among Hergé&#x27;s worst and stating: &quot;One couldn&#x27;t have imagined a less remarkable debut for a work destined for such greatness&quot;. He believed that Tintin was an existentialist &quot;Sartre-esque character&quot; who existed only through his actions, operating simply as a narrative vehicle throughout the book. Where Hergé showed his talent, Peeters thought, was in conveying movement, and in utilising language in a &quot;constantly imaginative&quot; way. He considered the story&#x27;s &quot;absurdity&quot; to be its best feature, rejecting plausible scenarios in favour of the &quot;joyously bizarre&quot;, such as Tintin being frozen solid and then thawing, or Snowy dressing in a tiger skin to scare away a real tiger. Hergé biographer Pierre Assouline described the comic writer&#x27;s image of the Soviet Union as being &quot;a Dantesque vision of poverty, famine, terror, and repression&quot;.

Marking the release of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; film in 2011, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) commissioned a documentary devoted to &quot;Tintin in the Land of the Soviets&quot; in which journalist Frank Gardner—who considered Tintin to be his boyhood hero—visited Russia, investigating and defending the accuracy of Hergé&#x27;s account of Soviet human rights abuses. First airing on Sunday 30 October on BBC Two, the documentary was produced by Graham Strong, with Luned Tonderai as producer and Tim Green as executive producer. David Butcher reviewed the documentary for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, opining that Gardner&#x27;s trip was dull compared to the comic&#x27;s adventure, but praising a few &quot;great moments&quot;, such as the scene in which Gardner tested an open-topped 1929 Amilcar, just as Tintin did in the adventure.

== Public domain status ==
Under US law, the term for the Tintin comics is 95 years from their date of first publication abroad in 1929. As of January 1, 2025, Tintin and other characters appearing in the original 1929 comic strips entered the public domain in the United States. Subsequent Tintin works will enter the public domain yearly on January 1 if United States copyright laws are not amended. However, Tintin remains under copyright in his original country, Belgium, and other countries utilizing terms that expire after a set period of time following the author&#x27;s death.

<doc id="525516" wikidata="Q7469" url="?curid=525516" title="Mission District, San Francisco">
<text>The Mission District (Spanish: &quot;Distrito de la Misión&quot;), commonly known as the Mission (Spanish: &quot;La Misión&quot;), is a neighborhood in San Francisco, California. One of the oldest neighborhoods in San Francisco, the Mission District&#x27;s name is derived from Mission San Francisco de Asís, built in 1776 by the Spanish. The Mission is historically one of the most notable centers of the city&#x27;s Chicano/Mexican-American community.

==Location and climate==

The Mission District is located in east-central San Francisco. It is bordered to the east by U.S. Route 101, which forms the boundary between the eastern portion of the district, known as &quot;Inner Mission&quot;, and its eastern neighbor, Potrero Hill. Sanchez Street separates the neighborhood from Eureka Valley (containing the sub-district known as &quot;the Castro&quot;) to the north west and Noe Valley to the south west. The part of the neighborhood from Valencia Street to Sanchez Street, north of 20th Street, is known as the &quot;Mission Dolores&quot; neighborhood. South of 20th Street towards 22nd Street, and between Valencia and Dolores Streets is a distinct neighborhood known as Liberty Hill. Cesar Chavez Street (formerly Army Street) is the southern border; across Cesar Chavez Street is the Bernal Heights neighborhood. North of the Mission District is the South of Market neighborhood, bordered roughly by Duboce Avenue and the elevated highway of the Central Freeway which runs above 13th Street.

The principal thoroughfare of the Mission District is Mission Street. South of the Mission District, along Mission Street, are the Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon neighborhoods, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Outer Mission&quot; (not to be confused with the actual Outer Mission neighborhood). The Mission District is mostly located in Board of Supervisors district 9, with parts in districts 8 and 10.

The Mission is often warmer and sunnier than other parts of San Francisco. The microclimates of San Francisco create a system by which each neighborhood can have different weather at any given time, although this phenomenon tends to be less pronounced during the winter months. The Mission&#x27;s geographical location insulates it from the fog and wind from the west. This climatic phenomenon becomes apparent to visitors who walk downhill from 24th Street in the west from Noe Valley (where clouds from Twin Peaks in the west tend to accumulate on foggy days) towards Mission Street in the east, partly because Noe Valley is on higher ground whereas the Inner Mission is at a lower elevation.

The Mission includes four recognized sub-districts. The northeastern quadrant, adjacent to Potrero Hill is known as a center for high tech startup businesses including some chic bars and restaurants. The northwest quadrant along Dolores Street is famous for Victorian mansions and the popular Dolores Park at 18th Street. Two main commercial zones, known as the Valencia corridor (Valencia St, from about 15th to 22nd) and the 24th Street corridor known as &quot;Calle 24&quot; in the south central part of the Mission District are both very popular destinations for their restaurants, bars, galleries and street life.

==History==

===Native peoples and Spanish colonization===
Prior to the arrival of Spanish missionaries, the area which now includes the Mission District was inhabited by the Ohlone people who populated much of the San Francisco bay area. The Yelamu Indians inhabited the region for over 2,000 years. Spanish missionaries arrived in the area during the late 18th century. They found these people living in two villages on Mission Creek. It was here that a Spanish priest named Father Francisco Palóu founded Mission San Francisco de Asís on June 29, 1776. The Mission was moved from the shore of Laguna Dolores to its current location in 1783. Franciscan friars are reported to have used Ohlone slave labor to complete the Mission in 1791. This period marked the beginning of the end of the Yelamu culture. The Indian population at Mission Dolores dropped from 400 to 50 between 1833 and 1841.

=== San Francisco&#x27;s southern expansion ===

Ranchos owned by Spanish-Mexican families such as the Valenciano, Guerrero, Dolores, Bernal, Noé and De Haro continued in the area, separated from the town of Yerba Buena, later renamed San Francisco (centered around Portsmouth Square) by a two-mile wooden plank road (later paved and renamed Mission Street).

The lands around the nearly abandoned mission church became a focal point of raffish attractions including bull and bear fighting, horse racing, baseball and dueling. A famous beer parlor resort known as The Willows was located along Mission Creek just south of 18th Street between Mission and San Carlos streets. From 1865 to 1891, a large conservatory and zoo known as Woodward&#x27;s Gardens covered two city blocks bounded by Mission, Valencia, 13th and 15th streets. In the decades after the Gold Rush, the town of San Francisco quickly expanded, and the Mission lands were developed and subdivided into housing plots for working-class immigrants, largely German, Irish, and Italian, and also for industrial uses.

As the city grew in the decades following the Gold Rush, the Mission District became home to the first professional baseball stadium in California, opened in 1868 and known as Recreation Grounds, seating 17,000 people, which was located at Folsom and 25th streets; a portion of the grounds remain as present day Garfield Square. Also, in the 20th century, the Mission District was home to two other baseball stadiums: Recreation Park, located at 14th and Valencia, and Seals Stadium, located at 16th and Bryant, with both these stadiums being used by the baseball team named after the Mission District known as the Mission Reds and the San Francisco Seals.

Irish immigrants moved into the Mission in the late 19th century. The Irish made their mark not only by working for the city government but by helping build the Catholic schools in the Mission District.

===Earthquake and population shifts===
During California&#x27;s early statehood period, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, large numbers of Irish and German immigrant workers moved into the area. Around 1900, the Mission District was still one of San Francisco&#x27;s least densely populated areas, with most of the inhabitants being white families from the working class and lower middle class who lived in single-family houses and two-family flats. Development and settlement intensified after the 1906 earthquake, as many displaced businesses and residents moved into the area, making Mission Street a major commercial thoroughfare.

In 1901, the city of San Francisco changed laws and forbade burials in the city, which helped form the nearby city of Colma. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, a single working water hydrant (the so-called &#x27;Golden Fire Hydrant&#x27;) saved the Mission District from being burned down by massive fires sparked by the earthquake. In the 1910s, the roads into Colma were not well maintained and it was a common practice to use the street cars to move bodies. Valencia Street became a location of many mortuaries and funeral homes during this time due to the quick access to Colma by street car.

In 1926, the Polish community of San Francisco converted a church at 22nd and Shotwell streets and opened its doors as the Polish Club of San Francisco; it is referred to today as the &quot;Dom Polski&quot;, or Polish Home. The Irish American community made its mark on the area during this time, with notable residents such as etymologist Peter Tamony calling the Mission home.

During the 1940s to 1960s, a large number of Mexican immigrants moved into the area—displaced from an earlier &quot;Mexican Barrio&quot; located on Rincon Hill, demolished in order to create the western landing of the Bay Bridge—initiating white flight and giving the Mission a heavily Chicano/Latino character for which it continues to be known today. Central American immigration starting in the 1960s has contributed to a Central American presence outnumbering those of Mexican descent.

===1970s–1990s===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Chicano/Latino population in the western part of the Mission (including the Valencia Corridor) declined somewhat and more middle-class young people moved in, including gay and lesbian people (alongside the existing LGBTQ Latino population). One political movement during the early 70s emerged in the community as seven young Latino men known as Los Siete de la Raza from the Mission District were being charged for the 1969 murder of a San Francisco police officer. The community got together as these young men were standing up to what was being said about them and were determined to be heard. The people around the Mission District knew these seven young individuals as change-makers; they were actively trying to get more people from the Mission District to go to college, they also worked with organizations that helped make the community better for Latino people which included a free bilingual services through Centro de Salud, which ultimately led other local hospitals to do the same. They were also involved in a free breakfast program, a community newspaper, and its main program, the &quot;Los Siete&quot; Defense Committee.

From the mid-1970s through the 1980s, the Valencia Street corridor included one of the most concentrated and visible lesbian neighborhoods in the United States. The Women&#x27;s Building, Osento Bathhouse, Old Wives Tales bookstore, Artemis Cafe, Amelia&#x27;s and The Lexington Club were part of that community.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Valencia Street corridor had a lively punk nightlife featuring the bands The Offs, The Avengers, the Dead Kennedys, Flipper, and several clubs including The Offensive, The Deaf Club, Valencia Tool &amp; Die and The Farm. The former fire station on 16th Street, called the Compound, sported what was commonly referred to as &quot;the punk mall&quot;, an establishment that catered to punk style and culture. On South Van Ness, Target Video and &quot;Damage&quot; magazine were located in a three-story warehouse. The former Hamms brewery was converted to a punk living/rehearsal building, popularly known as The Vats. The neighborhood was dubbed &quot;the New Bohemia&quot; by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 1995.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the neighborhood received a higher influx of immigrants and refugees from Central America, South America, the Middle East and even the Philippines and former Yugoslavia, fleeing civil wars and political instability at the time. These immigrants brought in many Central American banks and companies which would set up branches, offices, and regional headquarters on Mission Street.

=== 1990s–present ===
From the late 1990s through the 2010s, and especially during the dot-com boom, young urban professionals moved into the area. It is widely believed that their movement initiated gentrification, raising rent and housing prices. A number of Latino American middle-class families as well as artists moved to the Outer Mission area, or out of the city entirely to the suburbs of East Bay and South Bay area. Despite rising rent and housing prices, many Mexican and Central American immigrants continue to reside in the Mission, although the neighborhood&#x27;s high rents and home prices have led to the Latino population dropping by 20% over the decade until 2011. However, in 2008 the Mission still had a reputation of being artist-friendly.

In 2000, the Mission District&#x27;s Latino population was at 60%. By 2015 it had dropped to 48%; a city-funded research study that year predicted a decline to 31 percent by 2025. However, the Mission remains the cultural nexus and epicenter of San Francisco&#x27;s Mexican/Chicano, and to a lesser extent, the Bay Area&#x27;s Nicaraguan, Salvadoran and Guatemalan community. While Mexican, Salvadoran, and other Latin American businesses are pervasive throughout the neighborhood, residences are not evenly distributed. Of the neighborhood&#x27;s Chicano/Latino residents, most live on the eastern and southern sides. The western and northern sides of the neighborhood are more affluent and white. As of 2017, the northern part of the Mission, together with the nearby Tenderloin, is home to a Mayan-speaking community, consisting of immigrants who have been arriving since the 1990s from Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán region. Their presence is reflected in the Mayan-language name of In Chan Kaajal Park, opened in 2017 north of 17th Street between Folsom and Shotwell streets.

==Landmarks and features==

Mission Dolores, the eponymous former mission located at the far western border of the neighborhood on Dolores Street, continues to operate as a museum and as a California Historical Landmark, while the newer basilica built and opened next to it in 1918 continues to have an active congregation.

Dolores Park (Mission Dolores Park) is the largest park in the neighborhood, and one of the most popular parks in the city. Dolores Park is near Mission Dolores. Across from Dolores Park is Mission High School, built in 1927 in the Mediterranean Revival style.

The San Francisco Armory is a castle-like building located at 14th and Mission that was built as an armory for the U.S. Army and California National Guard. It served as the headquarters of the 250th Coast Artillery from 1923 through 1944, and of the 49th Infantry, also known as the 49ers, during the Cold War.

===Food===
The Mission District is also famous and influential for its restaurants. Dozens of taquerías are located throughout the neighborhood, showcasing a localized styling of Mexican food. San Francisco is the original home of the Mission burrito. There is also a high concentration of Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Nicaraguan restaurants there as well as a large number of street food vendors. In the last couple decades a number of Mission restaurants have gained national attention, most notably the five restaurants that have received Michelin stars for 2017: Commonwealth, Lazy Bear, Aster, Californios, and Al&#x27;s Place. A large number of other restaurants are also popular, including: Mission Chinese Food, Western Donut, Bar Tartine, La Taqueria, Papalote, Foreign Cinema on Mission Street, and Delfina on 18th. La Mejor Bakery, a San Francisco legacy business, is located in the Mission.

===Art scene===

Numerous Latino artistic and cultural institutions are based in the Mission. These organizations were founded during the social and cultural renaissance of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Latino community artists and activists of the time organized to create community-based arts organizations that were reflective of the Latino aesthetic and cultural traditions. The Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, established by Latino artists and activists, is an art space that was founded in 1976 in a space that was formerly a furniture store. The local bilingual newspaper El Tecolote was founded in 1970. The Mission&#x27;s Galería de la Raza, founded by local artists active in el Movimiento (the Chicano civil rights movement), is a nationally recognized arts organization, also founded during this time of cultural and social renaissance in the Mission, in 1971. Late May, the city&#x27;s annual Carnaval festival and parade marches down Mission Street. Inspired by the festival in Rio de Janeiro, it is held in late May instead of the traditional late February to take advantage of better weather. The first Carnaval in San Francisco happened in 1978, with less than 100 people dancing in a parade that went around Precita Park. Alejandro Murguía (born 1949) is an American poet, short story writer, editor and filmmaker who was named San Francisco Poet Laureate in 2012. He is known for his writings about the Mission District where he has been a long-time resident.

Due to the existing cultural attractions, formerly less expensive housing and commercial space, and the high density of restaurants and drinking establishments, the Mission is a magnet for young people. An independent arts community also arose and, since the 1990s, the area has been home to the Mission School art movement. Many studios, galleries, performance spaces, and public art projects are located in the Mission, including 1890 Bryant St Studios, Southern Exposure, Art Explosion Studios, City Art Collective Gallery, Artists&#x27; Television Access, Savernack Street, and the oldest, alternative, not-for-profit art space in the city of San Francisco, Intersection for the Arts. There are more than 500 Mission artists listed on Mission Artists United site put together by Mission artists. The Roxie Theater, the oldest continuously operating movie theater in San Francisco, is host to repertory and independent films as well as local film festivals. Poets, musicians, emcees, and other artists sometimes gather on the southwest corner of the 16th and Mission intersection to perform. Dance Mission Theater is a nonprofit performance venue and dance school in the neighborhood as well.

==== Murals ====
Throughout the Mission walls and fences are decorated with murals initiated by the Chicano Art Mural Movement of the 1970s and inspired by the traditional Mexican paintings. Some of the more significant mural installations are located on Balmy Alley and Clarion Alley. Many of these murals have been painted or supported by the Precita Eyes muralist organization.

==== Music scene ====
The Mission is rich in musical groups and performances. Mariachi bands play in restaurants throughout the district, especially in the restaurants congregated around Valencia and Mission in the northeast portion of the district. Carlos Santana spent his teenage years in the Mission, graduating from Mission High School in 1965. He often returned to the neighborhood, including for a live concert with his band Santana that was recorded in 1969, and for the KQED documentary &quot;The Mission&quot; filmed in 1994.

The locally inspired song &quot;Mission in the Rain&quot; by Robert Hunter and Jerry Garcia appeared on Garcia&#x27;s solo album &quot;Reflections&quot;, and was played by the Grateful Dead five times in concert in 1976.

Classical music is heard in the concert hall of the Community Music Center on Capp Street.

The area is also home to Afrolicious, and Dub Mission, a formerly weekly reggae/dub party started in 1996, and over the years has brought many reggae and dub musicians to perform there.

The Mission District also has a Hip-hop/Rap music scene. Other prominent musicians and musical personalities include alternative rock bands and musicians Luscious Jackson, Faith No More, The Looters, Primus, Chuck Prophet &amp; The Mission Express, Beck, and Jawbreaker.

=== Media ===
The Mission District is covered by three free bilingual newspapers. El Tecolote is biweekly and has online articles. Mission Local is predominantly an online news site but does publish a semiannual printed paper. El Reportero is a weekly newspaper that also has an online site.

=== Transit ===
The neighborhood is served by the BART rail system with stations on Mission Street at 16th Street and 24th Street, by Muni bus numbers 9, 9R, 12, 14, 14R, 22, 27, 33, 48, 49, 67, and along the western edge by the J Church Muni Metro line, which runs down Church Street and San Jose Avenue.

=== Gentrification ===
The Mission District is a historic transit hub for the Chicano and the Latino community, especially on the 16th Street BART Plaza. An atmosphere like a public market with live music and food trucks, it is also a commuting point for public transportation, which primarily serves low-income working-class people. The majority of the residents in the Mission District are of minority and low-income families and use this useful and open hub for gatherings and doing local businesses such as food trucks. However, because of the Dot-Com Boom that occurred in the 1990s and the rise of technology and social media, major technology companies such as Google and Facebook have moved their offices to such places as Silicon Valley, in the South Bay, that have now become the hot spot for tech companies. The Mission has felt the downstream effects of this demographic shift acutely. The intense surge in demand for housing and low supply of available housing has placed upward pressure on rents in transit hubs like the Mission, leading to gentrification and the displacement of families and small businesses. However, many residents protested and engaged in activism. They created a group called the &quot;Plaza 16 Coalition&quot; in response to the gentrification and the new zoning law, the &quot;Eastern Neighborhoods Plan&quot;. They advocate for affordable housing, opposing market-rate developments and the luxury developments.

==Education==

San Francisco Unified School District operates public schools. Schools in the Mission District include:
* John O&#x27;Connell High School
* Buena Vista Horace Mann K-8 Community School
* Bryant Elementary School
* César Chávez Elementary School
* Leonard R. Flynn Elementary School
* Marshall Elementary School
* George R. Moscone Elementary School - it had 350 students.
* Zaida T. Rodriguez Early Education School
* Hilltop Special Service Center (special school for grades 7–12)

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco operates St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic School, which opened in 1878. Previously its students were Irish or Italian American, but by 2014 95% of the student body was Latino and about two thirds were categorized as economically disadvantaged. Enrollment was once around 600 but by 2014 was around 300 due to gentrification. Its yearly per-student cost was $5,800 while yearly tuition, the lowest in the archdiocese, was $3,800.

<doc id="525519" wikidata="Q727908" url="?curid=525519" title="Chemtrail conspiracy theory">
<text>The chemtrail conspiracy theory is the erroneous belief that long-lasting condensation trails left in the sky by high-flying aircraft are actually &quot;chemtrails&quot; consisting of chemical or biological agents, sprayed for nefarious purposes undisclosed to the general public. Believers in this conspiracy theory say that while normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly, contrails that linger must contain additional substances. Those who subscribe to the theory speculate that the purpose of the chemical release may be solar radiation management, weather modification, psychological manipulation, human population control, biological or chemical warfare, or testing of biological or chemical agents on a population, and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems.

The claim has been dismissed by the scientific community. There is no evidence that purported chemtrails differ from normal water-based contrails routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. Proponents have tried to prove that chemical spraying occurs, but their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions. Because of the conspiracy theory&#x27;s persistence and questions about government involvement, scientists and government agencies around the world have repeatedly explained that the supposed chemtrails are in fact normal contrails. 

The term &#x27;chemtrail&#x27; is a portmanteau of the words &#x27;chemical&#x27; and &#x27;trail&#x27;, just as &#x27;contrail&#x27; blends &#x27;condensation&#x27; and &#x27;trail&#x27;.

== History ==
Chemtrail conspiracy theories began to circulate after the United States Air Force (USAF) published a 1996 report about weather modification. In the late 1990s, the USAF was accused of &quot;spraying the U.S. population with mysterious substances&quot; from aircraft &quot;generating unusual contrail patterns.&quot; The theories were posted on Internet forums by people including Richard Finke and William Thomas and were among many conspiracy theories popularized by late-night radio host Art Bell, starting in 1999. As the chemtrail conspiracy theory spread, federal officials were flooded with angry calls and letters.

A multi-agency response attempting to dispel the rumors was published in 2000 by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Many chemtrail believers interpreted agency fact sheets as further evidence of the existence of a government cover-up. The EPA refreshed its posting in 2015.

In the early 2000s, the USAF released an undated fact sheet that stated the conspiracy theories were a hoax fueled in part by citations to a 1996 strategy paper drafted within their Air University titled &quot;Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025&quot;. The paper was presented in response to a military directive to outline a future strategic weather modification system for the purpose of maintaining the United States&#x27; military dominance in the year 2025, and identified as &quot;fictional representations of future situations/scenarios.&quot; The USAF further clarified in 2005 that the paper &quot;does not reflect current military policy, practice, or capability&quot; and that it is &quot;not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future.&quot; Additionally, the USAF states that the chemtrail&#x27; hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities, scientific organizations, and major media publications.&quot;

The conspiracy theories are seldom covered by the mainstream media, and when they are, they are usually cast as an example of anti-government paranoia. For example, in 2013, when it was made public that the CIA, NASA, and NOAA intended to provide funds to the National Academy of Sciences to conduct research into methods to counteract global warming with geoengineering, an article in the &quot;International Business Times&quot; anticipated that &quot;the idea of any government agency looking at ways to control, or manipulate, the weather will be met with scrutiny and fears of a malign conspiracies&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;], and mentioned chemtrail conspiracy theories as an example.

==Description==
Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory find support for their theories in their interpretations of sky phenomena, videos posted to the Internet, and reports about government programs; they also have certain beliefs about the goals of the alleged conspiracy and the effects of its alleged efforts and generally take certain actions based on those beliefs.

=== Interpretation of evidence ===

Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory say that chemtrails can be distinguished from contrails by their long duration, asserting that the chemtrails are those trails left by aircraft that persist for as much as a half-day or transform into cirrus-like clouds. The proponents claim that after 1995, contrails had a different chemical composition and lasted a lot longer in the sky; proponents fail to acknowledge evidence of long-lasting contrails shown in World War II–era photographs.

Proponents characterize contrails as streams that persist for hours and that, with their criss-cross, grid-like, or parallel stripe patterns, eventually blend to form large clouds. Proponents view the presence of visible color spectra in the streams, unusual concentrations of sky tracks in a single area, or lingering tracks left by unmarked or military airplanes flying atypical altitudes or locations as markers of chemtrails.

Photographs of barrels installed in the passenger space of an aircraft for flight test purposes have been claimed to show aerosol dispersion systems. The barrels&#x27; actual purpose is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel to test different centers of gravity while the aircraft is in flight.

Former CIA employee and whistleblower Edward Snowden, interviewed on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, said he had searched through all the secret information of the U.S. government for evidence about (aliens and) chemtrails. According to a CNN report about the webcast, he said: &quot;In case you were wondering: ... Chemtrails are not a thing&quot; and &quot;I had ridiculous access to the networks of the NSA, the CIA, the military, all these groups. I couldn&#x27;t find anything&quot;.

Jim Marrs has cited a 2007 Louisiana television station report as evidence for chemtrails. In the report, the air underneath a crosshatch of supposed chemtrails was measured and apparently found to contain unsafe levels of barium: at 6.8 parts per million, three times the nationally recommended limit. But a subsequent analysis of the footage showed that the equipment had been misused and the reading exaggerated by a factor of 100—the true level of barium measured was both usual and safe.

In 2014, a video that went viral showed a commercial passenger airplane landing on a foggy night, which was described as emitting chemtrails. &quot;Discovery News&quot; pointed out that passengers sitting behind the wings would clearly see anything being sprayed, which would defeat any intent to be secretive, and that the purported chemical emission was normal air disruption caused by the wings, visible due to the fog. 

In October 2014, Englishman Chris Bovey filmed a video of a plane jettisoning fuel on a flight from Buenos Aires to London, which had to dump fuel to lighten its load for an emergency landing in São Paulo. The clip went viral on Facebook, with over three million views and more than 52,000 shares, cited as evidence of chemtrails. He later disclosed that the video post was done as a prank.

In some accounts, the chemicals are described as barium and aluminum salts, polymer fibers, thorium, or silicon carbide.

Chemtrail believers interpret the existence of cloud seeding programs and research into climate engineering as evidence of the conspiracy.

===Beliefs===
Various versions of the chemtrail conspiracy theory have been propagated via the Internet and radio programs. There are websites dedicated to the conspiracy theory, and it is particularly favored by far-right groups because it fits well with a deep suspicion of the government.

A 2014 review of 20 chemtrail websites found that believers appeal to science in some of their arguments but do not believe what academic or government-employed scientists say; scientists and federal agencies have consistently denied that chemtrails exist, explaining the sky tracks are simply persistent contrails. The review also found that believers generally hold that chemtrails are evidence of a global conspiracy; they allege various goals which include profit (for example, manipulating futures prices, or making people sick to benefit drug companies), population control, or weapons testing (use of weather as a weapon, or testing bioweapons). One of these ideas is that clouds are being seeded with electrically conductive materials as part of a massive electromagnetic superweapons program based around the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). Believers say chemtrails are toxic; the 2014 review found that they generally hold that every person is under attack and often express fear, anxiety, sadness, and anger about this. A 2011 study of people from the US, Canada, and the UK found that 2.6% of the sample believed entirely in the conspiracy theory, and 14% believed it partially. An analysis of responses given to the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study showed that 9% of the 36,000 respondents believed it was &quot;completely true&quot; that &quot;the government has a secret program that uses airplanes to put harmful chemicals into the air&quot; while a further 19% believed this was &quot;somewhat true&quot;.

Chemtrail conspiracy theorists often describe their experience as being akin to a religious conversion experience. When they &quot;wake up&quot; and become &quot;aware&quot; of chemtrails, the experience motivates them to advocacy of various forms. For example, they often attend events and conferences on geoengineering, and have sent threats to academics working in geoengineering.

Some chemtrail believers adopt the notions of Wilhelm Reich, who devised a &quot;cloudbuster&quot; device from pipework. Reich claimed this device would influence weather and remove harmful energy from the atmosphere. Some chemtrail believers have built cloudbusters filled with crystals and metal filings, which are pointed at the sky in an attempt to clear it of chemtrails.

Chemtrail believers sometimes gather samples and have them tested, rather than rely on reports from government or academic laboratories, but their experiments are usually flawed; for example, collecting samples in jars with metal lids contaminates the sample and is not done in scientific testing.

=== Incidents ===

In 2001, in response to requests from constituents, U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich introduced (but did not author) H.R. 2977 (107th), the Space Preservation Act of 2001, which would have permanently prohibited basing weapons in space, listing chemtrails as one of a number of &quot;exotic weapons&quot; that would be banned. Proponents have interpreted this explicit reference to chemtrails as official government acknowledgment of their existence. Skeptics noted that the bill in question also mentions &quot;extraterrestrial weapons&quot; and &quot;environmental, climate, or tectonic weapons&quot;. The bill received an unfavorable evaluation from the United States Department of Defense and died in committee, with no mention of chemtrails appearing in the text of any of Kucinich&#x27;s three subsequent failed attempts to enact a Space Preservation Act.

In 2003, in a response to a petition by concerned Canadian citizens that &quot;chemicals used in aerial sprayings are adversely affecting the health of Canadians&quot;, the Government House Leader responded: &quot;There is no substantiated evidence, scientific or otherwise, to support the allegation that there is high altitude spraying conducted in Canadian airspace. The term &#x27;chemtrails&#x27; is a popularised expression, and there is no scientific evidence to support their existence.&quot; The House leader added, &quot;it is our belief that the petitioners are seeing regular airplane condensation trails or contrails.&quot;

In 2005 in the United Kingdom, Elliot Morley, a Minister of State for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was asked by David Drew, the Labour Party Member of Parliament for Stroud, &quot;what research [the] Department has undertaken into the polluting effects of chemtrails for aircraft&quot;, and responded that &quot;the Department is not researching into chemtrails from aircraft as they are not scientifically recognised phenomena&quot;, and that work was being conducted to understand &quot;how contrails are formed and what effects they have on the atmosphere.&quot;

During the 2011–2017 California drought, some local politicians in Shasta County reacted credulously to conspiracy theories suggesting that weather-modifying chemtrails had caused the unusual weather conditions.

==Contrails==

Contrails, or condensation trails, are &quot;streaks of condensed water vapor created in the air by an airplane or rocket at high altitudes&quot;. Fossil fuel combustion (as in piston and jet engines) produces carbon dioxide and water vapor and soot particulates that act as cloud condensation nuclei. At high altitudes, the air is very cold. Hot humid air from the engine exhaust mixes with the colder surrounding air, causing the water vapor to condense into droplets or ice crystals that form visible clouds. The rate at which contrails dissipate is entirely dependent on weather conditions. If the atmosphere is near saturation, the contrail may exist for some time. Conversely, if the atmosphere is dry, the contrail will dissipate quickly.
It is well established by atmospheric scientists that contrails can persist for hours, and that it is normal for them to spread out into cirrus sheets. The different-sized ice crystals in contrails descend at different rates, which spreads the contrail vertically. Then the differential in wind speeds between altitudes (wind shear) results in the horizontal spreading of the contrail. This mechanism is similar to the formation of cirrus uncinus clouds. Contrails between can often merge into an &quot;almost solid&quot; interlaced sheet. Contrails can have a lateral spread of several kilometers, and given sufficient air traffic, it is possible for contrails to create an entirely overcast sky that increases the ice budget of individual contrails and persists for hours.
Experts on atmospheric phenomena say that the characteristics attributed to chemtrails are simply features of contrails responding to diverse conditions in terms of sunlight, temperature, horizontal and vertical wind shear, and humidity levels present at the aircraft&#x27;s altitude. In the US, the gridlike nature of the National Airspace System&#x27;s flight lanes tends to cause crosshatched contrails, and in general it is hard to discern from the ground whether overlapping contrails are at similar altitudes or not. The jointly published fact sheet produced by NASA, the EPA, the FAA, and NOAA in 2000 in response to alarms over chemtrails details the science of contrail formation, and outlines both the known and potential impacts of contrails have on temperature and climate. The USAF produced a fact sheet that described these contrail phenomena as observed and analyzed since at least 1953. It also rebutted chemtrail theories more directly by identifying the theories as a hoax and disproving the existence of chemtrails.

Patrick Minnis, an atmospheric scientist with NASA&#x27;s Langley Research Center, has said that logic does not dissuade most chemtrail proponents: &quot;If you try to pin these people down and refute things, it&#x27;s, &#x27;Well, you&#x27;re just part of the conspiracy.

Analysis of the use of commercial aircraft tracks for climate engineering has shown them to be generally unsuitable.

Astronomer Bob Berman has characterized the chemtrail conspiracy theory as a classic example of failure to apply Occam&#x27;s razor, writing in 2009 that instead of adopting the long-established &quot;simple solution&quot; that the trails consist of frozen water vapor, &quot;the conspiracy web sites think the phenomenon started only a decade ago and involves an evil scheme in which 40,000 commercial pilots and air traffic controllers are in on the plot to poison their own children.&quot;

A 2016 survey of 77 atmospheric scientists concluded that &quot;76 out of 77 (98.7%) of scientists that took part in this study said they had not encountered evidence of a [secret large-scale atmospheric program] (SLAP), and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, such as typical contrail formation and poor data sampling instructions presented on SLAP websites.&quot;

<text>Tsukiji (築地) is a district of Chūō, Tokyo, Japan. Literally meaning &quot;reclaimed land&quot;, it lies near the Sumida River on land reclaimed from Tokyo Bay in the 18th century during the Edo period. The eponymous Tsukiji fish market opened in 1935 and closed in 2018 when its operations were moved to the new Toyosu Market.

There are also districts named &quot;Tsukiji&quot; in Kobe and Amagasaki, cities in Hyōgo Prefecture, although neither is as well known as the district in Tokyo.

==History==
Tsukiji is built on reclaimed land out of what were once lowland marshes along the Sumida River delta. Throughout the Tokugawa period, earth from the shogunate&#x27;s extensive moat and canal excavations was systematically used to fill in the marshes along the river, creating new commercial districts and waterfront housing. The land was then named Tsukiji (築地), meaning &quot;constructed land&quot; or &quot;reclaimed land&quot;.

The Great Fire of Meireki of 1657 destroyed over two-thirds of Edo&#x27;s buildings, including Hongan-ji temple in Asakusa, the enormous Kantō headquarters of the Jōdo Shinshū sect. As a result, the temple site was relocated to Tsukiji, where many of the residents of nearby Tsukudajima were instrumental in its reconstruction. A number of other temples were also erected on what is now the outer marketplace. In addition, many private residences for samurai and feudal lords were constructed along the southern edge of Tsukiji.

In 1869, Tsukiji was designated as an approved residential area for foreigners and treaty port. However, as the Yokohama foreign settlement, opened in 1859, had already become a center for commercial activities and international trade it never flourished, Like Yokohama, it was separated from the city by a canal.Tsukiji grew more as a focus for education, healthcare and Christian mission work. Early classroom and study facilities for Keio University, Rikkyo University, Aoyama Gakkuin, St. Margaret&#x27;s Junior College, the American School in Japan and St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital were all to be found in this district. The Hoterukan (also known as Tsukiji Hotel or Edo Hotel), the first foreign -style hotel in Tokyo was a popular subject for woodblock prints after it opened in 1870, but it burned down after only four years.It was never very popular with foreigners, who gravitated to other parts of the city or Yokohama. Moreover, the roadstead was distant because the harbor was shallow. After twenty years (1889), it was reincorporated into the city of Tokyo. 

The United States legation occupied a site in Tsukiji from 1875 to 1890 on the site that is now occupied by the St. Luke&#x27;s Garden complex. The American legation had been moved from an old temple in Azabu, by Minister John Bingham, prominent Reconstruction era Ohio congressman and the longest serving American chief of mission to serve in Japan. A total of ten other legations also established quarters there.

Tsukiji was also the location from 1869 of the Imperial Japanese Navy technical training facilities, renamed in 1876 as the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. In 1888, the Naval Academy was relocated from Tsukiji to new, larger facilities at Etajima in Hiroshima Prefecture. The Tsukiji naval buildings next to the Akibashi bridge then became home, until 1923, of the Naval War College, a post-graduate staff college for senior naval officers.

After it was closed as a treaty port, it became an industrial area. The Great Kantō earthquake on September 1, 1923, and the resultant fires which raged in its aftermath, caused severe damage throughout central Tokyo. A significant portion of the Tsukiji district burned to the ground, and the old Nihonbashi fish market was razed. In the citywide restructuring following the quake, the Nihonbashi fish market was relocated to the Tsukiji district, and after the construction of a modern market facility, reopened in 1935. It was a major source of fish for the region. In his book on Tsukiji, Theodore Bestor called it &quot;the market at the center of the world.&quot;

==Places of interest==
* For many residents and visitors to Tokyo, the Central Wholesale Market, better known as the Tsukiji fish market was synonymous with sushi, sashimi and seafood products of every kind. While the inner market moved in October 2018 to the new Toyosu Market, the many small neighborhood restaurants, restaurant supply stores and retail operations in the outer market have remained and act as a major culinary tourist destination. Tsukiji was the largest fish market in the world handling more than 2000 tons of 450 types of seafood daily.
* Tsukiji Hongan-ji, a key temple of the Jōdo Shinshū sect of Buddhism. Inside the temple is a small memorial to deceased popular rock star hide.
* The Sumida River, the Tsukiji riverbank has pedestrian access north of the Kachidoki Bridge. 
* Quieter backstreets of Tsukiji still feature some older properties and storefronts clad in copper tiles used in the early Showa Period as a means of weather-proofing and distinctive architectural decoration.
* St. Luke&#x27;s Garden, one of Tokyo&#x27;s taller buildings containing, offices, a hotel, residential and long-term care accommodation. Part of the St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital campus.

Tsukiji 1-6 chome are zoned to Kyōbashi Tsukiji Elementary School (中央区立京橋築地小学校), while Tsukiji 7-chome is zoned to Akashi Elementary School (中央区立明石小学校). All of Tsukiji is zoned to Ginza Junior High School (中央区立銀座中学校)

Rikkyo Junior High School, a private secondary school, was established in Tsukiji in 1896 but the building was destroyed by the Great Kanto earthquake, so a new building in Ikebukuro opened in 1923.

<doc id="525538" wikidata="Q1247456" url="?curid=525538" title="Topsoil">
<text>Topsoil is the upper layer of soil. It has the highest concentration of organic matter and microorganisms and is where most of the Earth&#x27;s biological soil activity occurs.

==Description==

Topsoil is composed of mineral particles and organic matter and usually extends to a depth of 5-10 inches (13–25 cm). Together these make a substrate capable of holding water and air which encourages biological activity.

There are generally a high concentration of roots in topsoil since this is where plants obtain most of their vital nutrients. It also plays host to significant bacterial, fungal and entomological activity without which soil quality would degrade and become less suitable for plants. Bacteria and fungi can be essential in facilitating nutrient exchange with plants and in breaking down organic matter into a form that roots can absorb. Insects also play important roles in breaking down material and aerating and rotating the soil. Many species directly contribute to the health of the soil resulting in stronger plants. A healthy topsoil layer is a very rich microbiome that hosts a wide array of species.

Organic matter provides nutrition for living organisms and varies in quantity between different soils with the strength of the soil structure decreasing when more is present. It condenses and settles over time in different ways depending upon conditions such as beneath roadbeds and foundations vs uncovered and exposed to the elements. The structure becomes affected once the soil is dehydrated. Dehydrated topsoil volume substantially decreases and may suffer wind erosion.

== Production ==
Topsoil is naturally produced in the process of soil formation or pedogenesis. Natural topsoil is mined and conditioned for human use and makes up the bulk of commercial topsoil available. The current rate of use and erosion outpaces soil generation.

It is possible to create artificial topsoil which supports some of the engineering or biological uses of topsoil. More traditional examples of artificial plant-growth media include terra preta and potting mix. Manufactured topsoil based on minerals, biosolids, compost and/or paper mill sludge is available commercially. A Victorian open-cut coal mine was rehabilitated with low-quality artificial topsoil made from local materials.

==Classification==
In soil classification systems, topsoil is known as the O Horizon or A Horizon. Soil horizons are layers parallel to the soil surface whose physical, chemical and biological characteristics differ from the layers above and beneath. The depth of the topsoil layer is measured as the depth of the surface to the first densely packed soil layer, known as subsoil.

In the United States, there is no federal, legal definition of the word topsoil when used in commerce.

==Evaluation==
Organisations such as the British Standards Institution (BSI) and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture publish guidelines for soil quality and the desired levels of topsoil nutrients broadly suitable for many plants.
Two common types of commercial topsoil are Bulk and Bagged Topsoil. The following table illustrates major differences between the two.
Alternatively the BSI relates the following values:

The preceding tables are for a multipurpose grade and certain levels can alter with regard to soil pH.

Standards also exist for specialist soils suitable for plants with specific needs including acidic or ericaceous soil and calcareous soil. These have different pH levels to typical soil and are meant for growing different plant species. Low fertility, low fertility acidic and low fertility calcareous are other soil classifications designed for plants which thrive in nutrient sparse soil.

Examples of specialist plants include the Venus flytrap which is found in low nitrogen and phosphorus environments so is less tolerant of highly nutrient rich environments than other plants and less able to compete in them. Whereas blueberries require ericaceous soil to grow well and clover grows well in calcareous soil. Soils must therefore be selected to suit the plants which are intended to be grown and hence standards are required.

==Carbon to nitrogen ratio==

Topsoil is the primary resource for plants to grow and crops to thrive. The main two parameters for this are carbon and nitrogen. The carbon provides energy and nitrogen is required for plants to build proteins and hence tissues. Plants require them in a range of ratios to enable suitable growth. An optimum figure for topsoil in the UK is a C:N ratio of less than 20:1. A sawdust base typically has a high C:N ratio in the order of 400:1 while an alfalfa hay has a low carbonaceous content and can typically have a C:N ratio around 12:1.

==Commercial application==
A variety of soil mixtures are sold commercially as topsoil. Typical uses for this product are improving gardens and lawns or for use in container gardens. Potting soil, compost, manure and peat are also sold for domestic uses with each having specific intended purposes. Topsoil products typically are not as suitable for potting plants or growing fruit and veg as potting soil or compost. Using it for this purpose can also work out prohibitively expensive compared to other alternatives.

Topsoil is also used for proper surface grading near residential buildings. In order to protect against flooding the International Residential Code requires a 2% slope () for the first ten feet away from the home.Energy Star requires a rate of .

Commercially available topsoil (manufactured or naturally occurring) in the United Kingdom must be classified to British Standard BS 3882, with the current version dated 2015. The standard has several classifications of topsoil with the final classification requiring material to meet certain threshold criteria such as nutrient content, extractable phytotoxic elements, particle size distribution, organic matter content, carbon:nitrogen ratio, electrical conductivity, loss on ignition, pH, chemical and physical contamination. The topsoil must be sampled in accordance with the British Standard and European Norm BS EN 12579:2013 Soil improvers and growing media – Sampling.

==Erosion==
Topsoil erosion occurs when the topsoil layer is blown or washed away. The estimated annual costs of public and environmental health losses related to soil erosion in the United States exceed $45 billion. Conventional industrial agriculture practices such as ploughing and spraying high quantities of synthetic liquid fertilisers can degrade the quality of the soil. Intensive farming methods to satisfy high food demands with high crop yields and growing crops in monocultures can deplete the soil nutrients and damage the soil microbiome. These factors can affect the consistency and quality of the soil resulting in increased erosion.

Surface runoff from farm fields is a type of nonpoint source pollution. Topsoil as well as farm fertilizers and other potential pollutants run off unprotected farm fields when heavy rains occur. This can result in polluting waterways and groundwater and may potentially contaminate drinking water sources. Algae blooms can occur when high quantities of nutrients flood rivers, lakes or oceans often as a result of farm runoff or from sewage. These harmful algal blooms can be toxic and have devastating impacts on ecosystems and wildlife. They are often referred to as red tides due to the presence of toxic red algae which can impact human food sources by contaminating seafood.

Sustainable techniques attempt to slow erosion through the use of cover crops in order to build organic matter in the soil. The United States loses almost 3 tons of topsoil per acre per year. of topsoil can take between 500 and 1,000 years to form naturally, making the rate of topsoil erosion a serious ecological concern. Based on 2014 trends, the world has about 60 years of topsoil left.

<doc id="525548" wikidata="Q3285183" url="?curid=525548" title="General manager (baseball)">
<text>In Major League Baseball, the general manager (GM) of a team typically controls player transactions and bears the primary responsibility on behalf of the ballclub during contract discussions with players.

==Roles and responsibilities==
The general manager is normally the person who hires and fires the coaching staff, including the field manager who acts as the head coach. In baseball, the term &quot;manager&quot; used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager, not the general manager.

Before the 1960s, and in some rare cases since then, a person with the general manager title in sports has also borne responsibility for the non-player operations of the ballclub, such as ballpark administration and broadcasting. Ed Barrow, George Weiss and Gabe Paul were three baseball GMs noted for their administrative skills in both player and non-player duties.

==History and evolution==
In the first decades of baseball&#x27;s post-1901 modern era, responsibilities for player acquisition fell upon the club owner and/or president and the field manager. In some cases, particularly in the early years of the American League, the owner was a former player or manager himself: Charles Comiskey of the Chicago White Sox, Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics, and Clark Griffith of the Washington Senators are three prominent examples. Other owners tended to be magnates from the business world, although some, like Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; president Charles Ebbets, worked their way from front-office jobs into ownership positions. Most deferred player personnel evaluations to their on-field managers. One notable exception, cited by Mark L. Armour and Daniel R. Leavitt in their book &quot;In Pursuit of Pennants&quot;, was German immigrant Barney Dreyfuss, owner of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1900 to 1932. Dreyfuss had no playing background, but was one of the most astute judges of talent of his time. Under Dreyfuss, Pittsburgh won six National League pennants and two World Series titles (1909 and 1925). The New York Giants&#x27; John McGraw, who also held a minority ownership stake in the team, is an example of a powerful manager who, during his three decades at the Giants&#x27; helm, exerted control over off-field aspects of the team&#x27;s operation. McGraw managed the Giants from to , piloting them to ten National League pennants and three World Series titles (1905, 1921, and 1922) along the way. 
According to Baseball Almanac, the first man to hold the title of general manager was Billy Evans when he was appointed by the Cleveland Indians in 1927. However, the duties of the modern general manager already had been assumed by two executives — Barrow of the New York Yankees and Branch Rickey of the St. Louis Cardinals — whose formal title at the time was &quot;business manager.&quot; Both were former field managers of big-league teams, although Barrow had no professional playing background.

They assumed those positions (Barrow in 1920 and Rickey five years later) when clubs could legally control only 15 minor league players on option, and most young players were purchased or drafted from independently owned minor league teams. Rickey, creator of the modern and extensive farm system during the 1920s and 1930s, played a critical role in inventing the need for a general manager as well: with most teams coming to own or affiliate with multiple minor league teams from Class D to the top tier, and with dozens (and in some cases hundreds) of players under contract, they needed a front-office infrastructure to oversee the major league club, scouting and player procurement, minor league operations and player development, and business affairs. The general manager, in lieu of the &quot;owner-operator&quot;, provided that oversight.

But both the owner-operator and the field-manager-as-GM models survived into the 1980s. Owners Charlie Finley of the Oakland Athletics and Calvin Griffith of the Minnesota Twins functioned as their own chiefs of baseball operations. During the 1970s and 1980s, Alvin Dark of the Indians, Billy Martin of the Athletics (after Finley sold them in August ), and Whitey Herzog of the Cardinals combined manager and general manager duties, while Paul Owens of the Philadelphia Phillies and Jack McKeon of the San Diego Padres were general managers who appointed themselves field managers and held both posts.

==Superior executive levels==

The early decades of the 21st century have seen Major League Baseball teams create a new layer of authority between ownership and the general manager, typically called the &quot;President of Baseball Operations&quot; (POBO). These executives may work in concert with others in the organization styled as presidents but having non-baseball-centric responsibilities, such as President/CEO or President/COO. The trend began in , when, in June, Andy MacPhail was hired into a POBO role by the Baltimore Orioles. Then, in September, general manager Larry Beinfest was promoted to president of baseball operations by the Florida Marlins. In Beinfest&#x27;s case, he was assisted by a newly appointed GM, Michael Hill.

Writing for &quot;Sports Business Daily&quot; in March 2015, legal academic and sports lawyer Glenn M. Wong observed: &quot;No longer is it always true that the GM is the final decision-maker with respect to baseball decisions.&quot; One of the reasons for the creation of this new position was the soaring costs and revenues associated with modern MLB operations: &quot;Ownership is often heavily involved in major investments and decisions ... Installing another layer creates a sort of checks-and-balances system and a checkpoint for the decision-making process.&quot;

In June 2015, another article by Wong revisited the topic and compared the evolving job descriptions and career trajectories of GMs and POBOs. In 2016, &quot;Sports Business Daily&quot; writer Eric Fisher cited the growing importance of data analytics in playing personnel evaluations and long-term planning (in addition to in game strategy), and heavier investments in player development, domestically and internationally, as contributing to the POBO movement and other structural changes in baseball front offices.

The &quot;Baseball America Annual Directory&quot; of 2019 listed 12 POBOs among the 30 MLB teams, as well as one &quot;chief baseball officer&quot; and four &quot;executive vice presidents of baseball operations&quot;, operating above the GM level or also holding the GM title. In April 2024, a ranking by &quot;The Athletic&quot; of the top 10 front offices in MLB included seven teams with a president of baseball operations, and three without.

In some instances, a team may operate with a POBO or chief baseball officer and leave the GM role vacant. Two examples involve the Boston Red Sox: from 2017 through 2019, Dave Dombrowski served as POBO and the team had no GM; and in 2024, Craig Breslow served as chief baseball officer and the team again had no GM.

To coincide with the 2005 merger, Katsuyama residents were given a book commemorating the last 50 years of Katsuyama&#x27;s existence as a town and a special purple cloth with the town logo imprinted on it.

Local to Katsuyama is the , the only Okayama waterfall on the list of Japan&#x27;s Top 100 Waterfalls and home to Japanese macaque monkeys.

Recently, Katsuyama has also become known for its noren adorning the shops and houses along a 1 km stretch of the Katsuyama Historical Preservation District, wherein the Edo Period landscape of the town remains. The noren are all made by one craftswoman, Yoko Kano, who has her own workshop along the street.

<text>Yellowstone National Park in the northwest United States is home to a large variety of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, many of which migrate within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These animals are a major park attraction.

==Large mammals==
===American bison===
Bison are the largest grazing mammals in Yellowstone National Park. They are obligate herbivores, a grazer of grasslands and sedges in the meadows, the foothills, and even the high-elevation, forested plateaus of Yellowstone. Bison males, called bulls, can weigh upwards of 1,800 pounds. Females (cows) average about 1,300 pounds. Both stand approximately six feet tall at the shoulder, and can move with surprising speed to defend their young or when approached too closely by people. Bison breed from mid-July to mid-August, and bear one calf in April and May. Some wolf predation of bison is documented in Canada and has recently been observed in Yellowstone. Bison live an average lifespan of 20–25 years in the wild.

Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a population of wild American bison has persisted since prehistoric times, although fewer than 50 native bison remained there in 1902. Fearing extinction, the park imported 21 bison from two privately owned herds, as foundation stock for a bison ranching project that spanned 50 years at the Lamar Buffalo Ranch in Yellowstone&#x27;s Lamar Valley. Activities there included irrigation, hay-feeding, roundups, culling, and predator control, to artificially ensure herd survival. By the 1920s, some intermingling of the introduced and wild bison had begun. With protection from poaching, the native and transplanted populations increased. In 1936, bison were transplanted to historic habitats in the Firehole River and Hayden Valley. In 2003, the entire population numbered 1,477. Bison were trapped and herds periodically reduced until 1967, when only 397 bison were counted parkwide. All bison herd reduction activities were phased out after 1966, again allowing natural ecological processes to determine bison numbers and distribution. Presently, the park&#x27;s bison population is estimated at 4,000.

Bison are nomadic grazers, wandering high on Yellowstone&#x27;s grassy plateaus in summer. Despite their slow gait, bison are surprisingly fast for animals that weigh more than half a ton. In winter, they use their large heads like a plow to push aside snow and find winter food. In the park interior where snows are deep, they winter in thermally influenced areas and around the geyser basins. Bison also move to winter range in the northern part of Yellowstone.

===Bears===

, the grizzly bear (&quot;Ursus arctos horribilis&quot;) population within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Yellowstone and surrounding areas) was estimated at 718, with a minimum of 640 and a maximum of 796. The black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;) population within the same ecosystem was estimated at 575, with a minimum of 500 and a maximum of 650.

While in spawning streams, Yellowstone cutthroat trout are preyed upon by numerous predators including black bears and grizzly bears. Due to their high digestibility, and protein and lipid content, spawning cutthroat trout are one of the highest sources of net digestible energy for grizzly bears in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Cutthroat trout are an important late-spring and early-summer food source for bears, providing them the opportunity to regain body mass after den emergence, and assisting females with cubs meet the energetic demands of lactation. The average lifespan of a grizzly bear is about 22 years, and the average lifespan of a black bear is about 17 years.
With the reintroduction of gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) to Yellowstone National Park, much interest has been shown regarding the effects of a restored wolf population on both grizzly bears and black bears. Grizzly bears, black bears, and gray wolves have historically coexisted in much of the same range throughout a large portion of North America.

Bears were once commonly observed along roadsides and within developed areas of Yellowstone National Park. Bears were attracted to these areas by the availability of human foods in the form of handouts and unsecured camp groceries and garbage. Although having bears readily visible along roadsides and within developed areas was very popular with park visitors, an average of 48 bear-caused human injuries occurred each year from 1930 through 1969. Rocky Mountain grizzly bears have killed several people in the park since the 1970s.
Park authorities initiated an intensive bear management program in 1970. The objectives were restoring the grizzly bear and black bear populations to subsistence on natural forage, and reducing bear-caused injuries to humans. As part of the bear management program, regulations prohibiting the feeding of bears were strictly enforced. As the bears became more desperate for food and more aggressive, more of them were encountered in camping areas. Over a hundred grizzly bears had to be euthanized in the next several years, putting the park&#x27;s bear population on the brink of extinction. On July 28, 1975, under the authority of the Endangered Species Act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service listed the grizzly bear as a threatened species in the lower 48 states.

Over the next several decades, the bears learned to hunt and forage for themselves from non-human food sources, and their population slowly grew. On March 22, 2007, the grizzly bear was taken off the endangered species list. In the years since it was listed as a threatened species, the Yellowstone grizzly bear population has increased to at least 640 by 2017.

From 1980 to 2002, over 62 million people visited Yellowstone National Park. During the same period, 32 people were injured by bears. Grizzly bear-inflicted injuries to humans in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through the 1950s, and four per year during the 1960s. Human injuries from black bears have decreased from averages of 46 per year from 1931 to 1969, to four per year during the 1970s, and less than one per year from 1980 to 2002. The chance of being injured by a bear while in the park is approximately one in 1.9 million. Eight known bear-caused human fatalities have occurred within the park since 1872, including two in 2011 and one in 2015. Seven of the eight bears were grizzlies, while the other was undetermined.

===Bobcats===
In the early years of the 20th century, bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;) were reported as &quot;somewhat common&quot; in the park. There have been 9 to 14 reported sightings each decade since 1960. These sightings have occurred throughout the park; about 80 percent have occurred in the northern half. Bobcats have been reported in about equal numbers during all seasons. In 1960, a bobcat was killed by a car near Squaw Lake (now Indian Pond) on the north shore of Yellowstone Lake; its skull was deposited in the Yellowstone Museum collection. Other roadkilled bobcats were reported in 1993 and 1996. In 1960, a young bobcat was reported on the porch of the administration building at Mammoth; other young bobcats have been reported at Pebble Creek bridge (February 1977) and at Canyon campground (July 1986), where one accompanied an adult bobcat.

No research has been conducted in Yellowstone to determine the numbers or distribution of this elusive animal that usually is solitary, nocturnal, and widely scattered over its range.

Unlike Canadian lynx, which they resemble, bobcats elsewhere have been highly adaptable to human-caused changes in environmental conditions; some biologists believe that there are more bobcats in the United States today than in colonial times. Yellowstone has many rock outcrops, canyons bordered by rock ledges, conifer forests, and semi-open areas that seem to offer conditions favorable for bobcats—adequate shelter, a variety of rodents, rabbits, hares, birds, and other small animals as well as seasonal carrion, for food. Carrion is seldom used if live prey is available. Studies elsewhere have shown that bobcats also may kill both young and adult antelope and deer; they stalk bedded adults and may be carried long distances while biting their prey in the neck. Bobcats live an average lifespan of about 7 years.

Visitors are advised to report any sightings of bobcats or bobcat tracks to a ranger or visitor center. For animals so seldom recorded, every observation is considered useful and important.

===Canada lynx===
The Canada lynx is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Biologists studying the lynx in Yellowstone believe it has persisted in the park in some number since the park&#x27;s creation in 1872. A four-year study completed in 2005 concluded there is a small resident population of lynx in the park, but it is rarely seen directly or indirectly (tracks) by either biologists or visitors.

===Coyotes===

Yellowstone&#x27;s coyotes (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) are among the largest coyotes in the United States; adults average about 30 pounds (13–14 kg). and some weigh around 40 pounds (18 kg).

Coyotes live an average of about six years, although one Yellowstone coyote lived to be more than 24 before she was killed and eaten by a cougar. The coyote is a common predator in the park, often seen alone or in packs, traveling through the park&#x27;s wide open valleys hunting small mammals. But they are widely distributed and their sign can also be found in the forests and thermal areas throughout Yellowstone. They are capable of killing large prey, especially when they cooperatively hunt.

The reintroduction of wolves in 1995 has significantly decreased the coyote population, although those who remain often scavenge from wolf kills. Throughout the restoration project, coyote research has continued, with an eye toward identifying the interactions between coyotes and wolves and on assessing the effects of wolves on coyote populations. During planning and environmental assessment of the effects of wolf restoration, biologists anticipated that coyotes would compete with the larger canid, perhaps resulting in disruption of packs and numerical declines.

Coyotes occasionally lose their wariness of humans and frequent roadsides or developed areas, becoming conditioned to human food by receiving handouts or picking up food scraps. They can quickly learn bad habits like roadside begging behavior. This leads to potential danger for humans and coyotes. Several instances of coyote aggression toward humans have occurred in the park, including one that involved an actual attack. Habituation most likely played a role in this unusual coyote behavior.

===Elk===

Elk or wapiti (&quot;Cervus canadensis&quot;) are the most abundant large mammal found in Yellowstone; paleontological evidence confirms their continuous presence for at least 1,000 years. Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872, when market hunting of all large grazing animals was rampant. Not until after 1886, when the United States Army was called in to protect the park and wildlife slaughter was brought under control, did the large animals increase in number. In recent years, however, Yellowstone&#x27;s elk population has plummeted. The Northern Herd, the only herd that winters in the park, has declined from nearly 20,000 animals in 1994 to less than 4,000 in 2013. Ecologists have linked this decline to a declining population of cutthroat trout in Yellowstone Lake, caused by invasive lake trout. With less fish to eat, grizzly bears began to eat more elk calves, causing a steep decline in elk numbers.

More than 30,000 elk from 7-8 different herds summer in Yellowstone and approximately 15,000 to 22,000 winter in the park. The subspecies of elk that lives here are found from Arizona to northern Canada along the Rocky Mountain chain; other species of elk were historically distributed from coast to coast, but disappeared from the eastern United States in the early 19th century. Some other subspecies of elk still occupy coastal regions of California, Washington, and Oregon. Elk are the second largest member of the deer family (moose are the largest). Adult males, or bulls, range upwards of 700 pounds (~320 kg) while females, or cows, average 500-525 pounds (~225–240 kg). Their coats are reddish brown with heavy, darker-colored manes and a distinct yellowish rump patch. Elk usually live about 15 years in the wild.
Bulls grow antlers annually from the time they are nearly one year old. When mature, a bull&#x27;s &quot;rack&quot; may have 6 to 8 points or tines on each side and weigh more than 30 pounds. The antlers are usually shed in March or April, and begin regrowing in May, when the bony growth is nourished by blood vessels and covered by furry-looking &quot;velvet.&quot; Antler growth ceases each year by August, when the velvet dries up and bulls begin to scrape it off by rubbing against trees, in preparation for the autumn mating season or rut. A bull may gather 20-30 cows into his harem during the mating season, often clashing or locking antlers with another mature male for the privilege of dominating the herd group. By November, mating season ends and elk generally move to their winter ranges. Calves weighing 25-40 pounds are born in late May or early June.

===Moose===

Moose (&quot;Alces alces shirasi&quot; Nelson), the largest member of the deer family, were reportedly very rare in northwest Wyoming when Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872. Subsequent protection from hunting and wolf control programs may have contributed to increased numbers but suppression of forest fires probably was the most important factor, since moose here depend on mature fir forests for winter survival.

Surveys in the late 1980s suggested a total park population of fewer than 1000 moose. The moose calf crop has been declining since the fires of 1988. During that summer there was also high predation of moose by grizzly bears in small patches of surviving timber. The winter following the fires many old moose died, probably as a combined result of the loss of good moose forage and a harsh winter. The fires forced some moose into poorer habitats, with the result that some almost doubled their home range, using deeper snow areas than previously, and sometimes browsing burned lodgepole pines.

Moose are commonly observed in the park&#x27;s southwestern corner along the Bechler and Fall rivers, in the riparian zones around Yellowstone Lake, in the Soda Butte Creek, Pelican Creek, Lewis River, and Gallatin River drainages, and in the Willow Park area between Mammoth and Norris. Summer moose migrations from south and west of the park into Yellowstone have been confirmed by radio telemetry. Moose usually live to 20 years in the wild.

===Mountain goats===
Mountain goats (&quot;Oreamnos americanus&quot;) are not native in the park but were introduced into the Absaroka Range in Montana in the 1940s. They migrated into the park and breeding populations established themselves in the northwestern and northeastern regions of the park in the 1990s. As of 2008, the number of goats in and adjacent to the park is estimated to be 175–225. This colonization of a non-native species has raised concerns about adverse effects on alpine habitats. Surveys in 2002 and 2003 suggest that ridgetop vegetation cover is lower, and barren areas along alpine ridges are more prevalent in areas with relatively high goat use. Competition with high densities of mountain goats could also negatively affect bighorn sheep, whose range overlaps with mountain goats. Mountain goats generally live 15 years in the wild.

===Bighorn sheep===

Bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis&quot;) were once very numerous in western United States and were an important food source for humans. The &quot;Sheep eaters&quot;, a band of Shoshone people, lived year-round in Yellowstone until 1880. Their principal food was bighorn sheep and they made their bows from sheep horns. By 1900, during an &quot;epoch of relentless destruction by the skin hunters&quot;, bighorn numbers were reduced to a few hundred in the United States. In 1897 about 100-150 were estimated to be present in the park. By 1912, despite a disease (scab) contracted from domestic sheep, bighorns in the park had increased to more than 200 and travelers could find them with fair certainty by devoting a few days to searching around Mount Everts, Mount Washburn or other well-known ranges. In winter, small bands of sheep could then be seen every day between Mammoth and Gardiner. Bighorn sheep usually live 10–15 years in the wild.
===Mountain lions===

The mountain lion (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;), also called the cougar, is the largest member of the cat family living in Yellowstone. Mountain lions can weigh up to 200 pounds (~90 kg), although lions in Yellowstone are thought to range between 140 and 160 pounds (~65 and ~70 kg) for males and around 100 pounds (45 kg) for females. Two to three kittens may be born at any time of year, although most arrive in summer and fall. For reasons that are not clear, only about 50 percent of kittens survive their first year. The current population of lions in Yellowstone is estimated to be 18-24 animals and is thought to be increasing. Mountain lions live an average lifespan of about 12 years in the wild.

Mountain lions were significantly reduced by predator control measures during the early 20th century. It is reported that 121 lions were removed from the park between the years 1904 and 1925. At that time, the remaining population was estimated to be 12 individuals. Mountain lions apparently existed at very low numbers between 1925 and 1940. Reports of lions in Yellowstone have increased steadily from 1 each year between 1930 and 1939 to about 16 each year between 1980 and 1988. However, increases in visitor travel in Yellowstone and improvements in record keeping during this period probably contributed to this trend.

In 1987, the first study of mountain lion ecology was initiated in Yellowstone National Park. The research documented population dynamics of mountain lions in the northern Yellowstone ecosystem inside and outside the park boundary, determined home ranges and habitat requirements, and assessed the role of lions as a predator in the ecosystem. In recent years in other areas of the West, mountain lions have occasionally attacked humans. No documented lion/human confrontations have occurred in Yellowstone.

===Mule deer and white-tailed deer===

The mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;) is a deer whose habitat is in the western half of North America. It gets its name from its large mule-like ears. In Yellowstone mule deer are commonly found in forests, grasslands, and shrublands.

The white-tailed deer (&quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot;) occurs in aspen parklands and deciduous river bottomlands within the central and northern Great Plains, and in mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain regions from Wyoming to southeastern British Columbia. It is an occasional visitor to these habitats in the Yellowstone region. Both mule and white-tailed deer live an average lifespan of 10 to 15 years in the wild.

===Gray wolf===

Northern Rocky Mountain wolves, a subspecies of the gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), were native to Yellowstone when the park was established in 1872. Predator control was practiced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Between 1914 and 1926, at least 136 wolves were killed in the park; by the 1940s, wolf packs were rarely reported. By the 1970s, scientists found no evidence of a wolf population in Yellowstone; wolves persisted in the lower 48 states only in northern Minnesota and on Isle Royale in Michigan. Canadian grey wolves were introduced into Yellowstone in 1995. This move has returned wolves to land that was once ruled by the canine. They currently exist in several packs, the largest of which are the Slough Creek, Yellowstone Delta, and Leopold packs. The wolves had to &quot;re-learn&quot; an instinct that their ancestors once had: hunting bison. Being used to the elk in Canada, the wolves were dumbfounded by the large, burly bison found all over Yellowstone. However, their main prey remains elk. They have made many appearances on National Geographic Channel documentaries. Wolves in Yellowstone can live as long as 10 years in the wild, though 6 to 8 is normal.

The United States Fish and Wildlife Service provides weekly updates on the wolves of the Rocky Mountain region including wolves of Yellowstone.
This site has stated that at the end of 2011 there was at least 98 wolves in ten packs and two loner wolves in the park.

===Red fox===

A montane subspecies of red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes macroura&quot;) occurs in the park and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. These foxes are not overly common due to predation and displacement by the more common coyote. They are most commonly found in forested areas of the park.

==Small mammals==

There are at least 50 small mammal species known to occur in Yellowstone National Park, including four common species of bats: big brown bat, little brown bat, long-legged bat, and silver-haired bat. Squirrels, rabbits, skunks, raccoons, badgers, otters, beavers, porcupines, vole, mice, and shrew species are common, but many are nocturnal and rarely seen by visitors. The Uinta ground squirrel, least chipmunk, golden-mantled ground squirrel and American red squirrel are commonly encountered.

Weasel species, including the North American river otter are prevalent in the park. North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) were almost trapped out of the park region prior to its creation. In 1998, beaver populations were making a comeback and an estimated 500 beavers were living in the park with the densest colonial in the Bechler River and Fall River region, the Yellowstone River delta above Yellowstone Lake and the lower Madison River and its tributaries.

==Birds==
Since the creation of the park in 1872, 318 species of birds have been documented within its boundaries. Although Yellowstone is not a birding mecca because of its high altitude and cold winters, it is home to a variety of interesting bird species that attract visitor attention every year. The park has a good resident population of bald eagles, trumpeter swans, common loons, ospreys, American white pelicans, and sandhill cranes. The extensive rivers, lakes and wetlands are summer homes to large numbers of waterfowl, while the forests and meadows host many different species of warblers, sparrows and other passerine birds.

==Amphibians and reptiles==

Yellowstone is home for four species of amphibians. Glacial activity and current cool and dry conditions are likely responsible for their relatively low numbers in Yellowstone.

Although no Yellowstone reptile or amphibian species are currently listed as threatened or endangered, several — including the boreal toad — are thought to be declining in the West. Surveys and monitoring are underway to try to determine if amphibian populations are declining in Yellowstone National Park. In 2014, a population of plains spadefoot toad was found in the park. More common species include the boreal chorus frog, columbian spotted frog, and the blotched tiger salamander.

Cool, dry conditions limit Yellowstone&#x27;s reptiles to six species and population numbers for these species are not known. Known reptile species in the park: prairie rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus viridis viridis&quot;), bullsnake (&quot;Pituophis catenifer sayi&quot;), valley garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis fitchi&quot;), wandering garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis elegans vagrans&quot;), rubber boa (&quot;Charina bottae&quot;), sagebrush lizard (&quot;Sceloporus graciosus graciosus&quot;).
In 1991 park staff began cooperating with researchers from Idaho State University to sample additional park habitats for reptiles and amphibians. This led to establishment of long-term monitoring sites in the park. The relatively undisturbed nature of the park and the baseline data may prove useful in testing hypotheses concerning the apparent declines of several species of toads and frogs in the western United States. Reptile and amphibian population declines may be caused by such factors as drought, pollution, disease, predation, habitat loss and fragmentation, introduced fish and other non-native species.

==Fish==

Yellowstone Lake supports the largest inland population of cutthroat trout in the world, and is the core of the remaining undisturbed habitat for native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri&quot;) in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Each spring, cutthroat trout migrate from the lake to its tributaries to spawn.
Yellowstone cutthroat trout generally declined in the second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative lake trout, an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west cutthroat trout populations preyed upon by introduced lake trout have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive lake trout control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of lake trout from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any other time in the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. Whirling disease, which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there is no question they are causing it.

Yellowstone cutthroat trout have declined throughout the west and are currently designated as a &quot;Species of Special Concern-Class A&quot; by the American Fisheries Society. A formal petition to list this subspecies as &quot;threatened&quot; throughout its range was submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1998. Yellowstone National Park represents approximately 91% of the current range of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and contains 85% of the historical lake habitat for this subspecies, so the park is considered crucial to the survival of the species.

Other native sport fish, including westslope cutthroat trout and Montana grayling, have been under catch-and-release-only fishing rules since 1973. This is the first time mountain whitefish have been placed under such rules in Yellowstone National Park. The new rule gives mountain whitefish equal status to the other native sport fish in the park.

<doc id="525567" wikidata="Q3447736" url="?curid=525567" title="Dulce Base">
<text>Dulce Base is the subject of a conspiracy theory claiming that a jointly-operated human and alien underground facility exists under Archuleta Mesa on the Colorado–New Mexico border near the town of Dulce, New Mexico, in the United States. Claims of alien activity there first arose from Albuquerque businessman Paul Bennewitz.

==History==
Starting in 1979, Bennewitz became convinced he was intercepting electronic communications from alien spacecraft and installations outside of Albuquerque. By the 1980s he believed he had discovered a secret underground base near Dulce populated by grey aliens and humans. By 1983, Bennewitz&#x27;s claims appeared in the popular press. 

The story spread rapidly within the UFO community and by 1987, UFOlogist John Lear claimed he had independent confirmations of the base&#x27;s existence. Lear&#x27;s statement influenced Thomas Allen LeVesque, pen name &quot;Jason Bishop III&quot;, who later admitted to fabricating stories about Dulce Base.

In 1986, George Clinton Andrews discussed Dulce Base legends in his book &quot;Extra-Terrestrials Among Us&quot;. In 1988, the tabloid &quot;Weekly World News&quot; published a story entitled &quot;UFO base found in New Mexico&quot; which claimed that &quot;diabolical invaders from another solar system have set up a secret underground base in the rugged mountains of northern New Mexico – so they can shanghai human guinea pigs for bizarre genetic experiments&quot;. The &quot;Weekly World News&quot; story used supposed quotes from UFOlogist Leonard H. Stringfield as a source for its claims. Upon learning of the story, Stringfield protested, &quot;I never read such a distortion of facts in my life&quot;.

==Influences==
Political scientist Michael Barkun wrote that Cold War underground missile installations in the area gave superficial plausibility to the rumors, making the Dulce base story an &quot;attractive legend&quot; within UFOlogy. According to Barkun, claims about experiments on abductees and firefights between aliens and the Delta Force place the Dulce legend &quot;well outside even the most far-fetched reports of secret underground bases.&quot;

Residents of Dulce claim to have seen UFOs, strange moving lights, and other unexplained sightings in the area. Jicarilla Apache Legislative Council president Ty Vicenti &quot;has embraced the notion of a Dulce Base, partly in a push to stimulate tourism&quot;, and in 2016, the town hosted the Dulce Base UFO Conference at the local casino hotel.

Dulce Base legends have been noted for their similarity to the Shaver Mystery. In the mid-1940s, welder Richard Shaver began writing letters to science-fiction editor Raymond A. Palmer, who published them in various pulp outlets. Shaver told of malevolent subterranean beings (&quot;deros&quot;) who pilot disc-shaped spaceships. Palmer biographer Fred Nadis &quot;specifically highlights the tales of the supposed underground base near Dulce, New Mexico, as a prominent inheritor of the Shaver/Palmer tradition, characterizing Paul Bennewitz’s stories of alien experimentation as &#x27;a dero scene right out of a Shaver story.&#x27;&quot;

<text>was a village located in Tomata District, Okayama Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003 (before the merger), the village had an estimated population of 914 and a density of 10.10 persons per km2. The total area was 90.49 km2.

On March 1, 2005, Kamisaibara, along with the town of Okutsu, and the village of Tomi (all from Tomata District), was merged into the expanded town of Kagamino.

Kamisaibara is the site of the first discovery of an outcropping of uranium ore within Japan. After discovery, the Ningyō-tōge Office of Atomic Fuel Corporation (now called the Ningyō-tōge Environmental Engineering Center of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency) was built in 1957. The site has been involved in the &quot;development of front-end technologies for the nuclear fuel cycle, namely, uranium exploration, uranium mining, refining, and enrichment.&quot;

<text>Iona Victoria Campagnolo (née Hardy; October 18, 1932 – April 4, 2024) was a Canadian politician who served as the 27th Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia from 2001 to 2007; Campagnolo was the first woman to hold that office. Prior to becoming lieutenant governor, she was a Cabinet member in the Liberal government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

==Life and career==
Born Iona Victoria Hardy on Galiano Island, she got her start in politics in 1966 when she was elected an alderwoman in the city council of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. In 1974, she turned to federal politics, running successfully as a Liberal Party candidate for the House of Commons of Canada in the riding of Skeena. In 1976, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed her to the Cabinet as Minister of Amateur Sport. Frank King, the Chairman of the Calgary Olympic Development Organization credited Campagnolo as the first person to share the vision of Calgary hosting the 1988 Winter Olympic Games, assisting the group in securing $200 million in federal funding for the organization&#x27;s bid. She lost her seat to NDP challenger Jim Fulton in the 1979 election.

In 1982, she became president of the Liberal Party, a largely administrative position. During the 1984 convention which elected John Turner as party leader, Campagnolo created a minor furor within the party when she said that second-place leadership candidate Jean Chrétien was &quot;second in the balloting, but first in our hearts&quot;.

When John Turner became Liberal leader in 1984, a television camera caught Turner patting Campagnolo&#x27;s bottom. Although Campagnolo herself dismissed it (and patted Turner right back), the incident was used to paint Turner as being out of touch with contemporary women&#x27;s issues.

Campagnolo ran in North Vancouver—Burnaby in the September 1984 election but was defeated in the Mulroney landslide that reduced Turner&#x27;s Liberals to 40 seats. She did not run for re-election as party president at the next Liberal convention in 1986.

In 1973, Campagnolo was made a Member of the Order of Canada and promoted to Officer in 2008. In 1998, she received the Order of British Columbia.

In 1992, Campagnolo was elected as the founding chancellor of the University of Northern British Columbia and served in the position until 1998. She received an honorary degree from UNBC in 1999.

Campagnolo was the founding Chair of the non-profit Fraser Basin Council, serving from 1997 to 2001.

In 2001, on the advice of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, she was appointed by Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as British Columbia&#x27;s first female Lieutenant Governor. At her swearing-in, Campagnolo concluded her remarks in Chinook, saying, &quot;konoway tillicums klatawa kunamokst klaska mamook okoke huloima chee illahie&quot; – meaning: &quot;everyone was thrown together to make this strange new country (British Columbia).&quot; As the Queen&#x27;s viceroy in British Columbia, she was styled The Honourable for life. However, as she was already a Member of The Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada before she became lieutenant-governor, she was already styled The Honourable. She served in that position until September 30, 2007.

In 2003 the Chief Herald of Canada granted armorial bearings to Campagnolo.

Campagnolo died on April 4, 2024, at the age of 91.

==Personal life==
Campagnolo married Louis in 1952 with whom she had two children. The couple were later divorced.

<doc id="525650" wikidata="Q254827" url="?curid=525650" title="Ronnie Coleman">
<text>Ronald Dean Coleman (born May 13, 1964) is an American former professional bodybuilder, who is widely regarded as the greatest bodybuilder of all-time. Known as &quot;The King&quot;, Coleman shares the all-time record for most Mr. Olympia titles at eight with Lee Haney. The winner of 26 IFBB professional titles including the Mr. Olympia for eight consecutive years, he is also renowned for his combination of size and conditioning, dominant body-parts and extremely heavy workouts, making him the strongest Mr. Olympia of all-time.

Coleman was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2016 and was bestowed with the &#x27;Arnold Classic Lifetime Achievement Award&#x27; in 2021.

==Early life==
Ronnie Dean Coleman was born on May 13, 1964, in Monroe, Louisiana to Jessie Coleman and Jessie Benton Coleman. He was raised in a household that emphasized hard work and commitment. He graduated cum laude from Grambling State University in 1989 with a BSc in accounting. While there, he played football as a middle linebacker with the Grambling State Tigers under Hall of Fame coach Eddie Robinson.

After graduation, he failed to find work as an accountant and instead went to work at Domino&#x27;s Pizza, where he would eat the complimentary pizza every day due to being so poor that he could barely afford to eat outside of work.

He then became a police officer in Arlington, Texas, serving as an officer from 1989 to 2000 and a reserve officer until 2003.

== Bodybuilding career ==
=== 1990 to 1991 ===
Coleman&#x27;s fellow officer Gustavo Arlotta suggested he attend the &#x27;Metroflex Gym&#x27;, owned by amateur bodybuilder Brian Dobson. Dobson offered Coleman a free lifetime membership if he allowed Dobson to train him for the upcoming 1990 Mr. Texas bodybuilding competition. After training for Mr. Texas, Coleman won first place in both the heavyweight and overall categories. He also managed to defeat Dobson himself. Then he participated at the 1990 NPC Nationals, winning 3rd place at the Heavyweight division.

Following year, Coleman turned pro and emerged 4th place at the 1991 NPC Nationals Heavyweight division. He also decisively won 1991 IFBB World Amateur Championships&#x27;s Heavyweight division.

=== 1992 to 1994 ===
Coleman&#x27;s rise to the top of bodybuilding was relatively slow. In his first participation at the Mr. Olympia contest: 1992 Mr. Olympia held in Helsinki, Finland he ended up becoming the last (16th place). He also emerged 14th at the 1992 Night of Champions and 11th at the 1992 Chicago Pro Championships.

In 1993 Coleman did not take part in Mr. Olympia, but managed a 6th place at 1993 Chicago Pro Championships, 4th place at 1993 IFBB French Grand Prix, 6th place at 1993 IFBB German Grand Prix and 6th place in 1993 Niagara Falls Pro.

In 1994 Mr. Olympia held in Atlanta, Georgia, Coleman ended up being the 15th. The top athletes were continuously improving with Dorian Yates taking bodybuilding to the next level, and Coleman also increased the weights and intensity of his workouts. He also constantly participated in powerlifting competitions. In the same year, he secured 3rd place at 1994 IFBB French Grand Prix, 3rd place at 1994 IFBB German Grand Prix and 4th place at 1994 San Jose Pro Invitational.

=== 1995 to 1997 ===
In 1995 Coleman won his first pro show, winning 1995 Canada Pro Cup. He also improved on his placement at Mr. Olympia, emerging 11th at 1995 Mr. Olympia held in Atlanta, Georgia. He also secured 4th place at 1995 IFBB French Grand Prix, 6th place at 1995 IFBB Russian Grand Prix, 3rd place at 1995 IFBB Ukrainian Grand Prix, 6th place at 1995 Houston Pro Championships and 3rd place at 1995 Night of Champions.

In 1996 Mr. Olympia held in Chicago, Illinois, Coleman emerged 6th, winning $12,000 in the process. He also won 1996 Canada Pro Cup. Furthermore, he also secured 2nd place at 1996 Florida Pro Invitational, 5th place at 1996 IFBB English Grand Prix, 5th place at 1996 IFBB German Grand Prix, 5th place at 1996 IFBB Spanish Grand Prix and 2nd place at 1996 Night of Champions.

Around this time, Coleman started to compete prolifically, traveling around the world and taking trains instead of flights because it was all what he could afford, and kept up with the top athletes. He won 1997 IFBB Russian Grand Prix and came 3rd at 1997 Ironman Pro Invitational and 1997 IFBB Finnish Grand Prix. However, at 1997 Mr. Olympia held in Long Beach, California he was dropped to 9th place. He also secured 4th at 1997 Arnold Classic and 1997 IFBB Czech Grand Prix, 5th at 1997 IFBB English Grand Prix and 1997 IFBB German Grand Prix, 6th at 1997 IFBB Hungarian Grand Prix and 1997 San Jose Pro Invitational, and 7th at 1997 IFBB Spanish Grand Prix.

=== 1998 ===
In 1998, Coleman who had made dramatic improvements to his physique came to the 1998 IFBB Finnish Grand Prix with one of his best physiques ever. He defeated Kevin Levrone and Nasser El Sonbaty to win the title and started getting recognition for his &#x27;wide and thick&#x27; back development. Both of Coleman&#x27;s back poses: rear double biceps and rear lat spread were recognized as well as his front double biceps pose from this competition ranks among the best ever. He continued his success, also winning 1998 IFBB German Grand Prix, 1998 Toronto Pro and 1998 Night of Champions. Levrone stated &quot;It was the beginning of the end, for me and every other bodybuilder&quot;.

When Dorian Yates won his final title before retiring the previous year, 1998 opened the door for a new Mr. Olympia champion. Flex Wheeler was favored to become the titleholder, with predominant competition coming from Levrone, El Sonbaty and Shawn Ray. However, Coleman, whose quadruple victories already in the calendar year had considerably elevated his esteem and brought further improvements, weighing on stage, shredded to the bone, to defeat Wheeler, El Sonbaty, Levrone and Ray to win the 1998 Mr. Olympia held at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. He won a cash prize of $110,000. Judges praised Coleman&#x27;s superior back development, v-taper, conditioning and the posing routine which all aided his victory.

=== 1999 ===
In 1999, Coleman went up against one of the most iconic and toughest lineups in bodybuilding history at 1999 IFBB English Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious after defeating Wheeler, Levrone, Dexter Jackson, Milos Sarcev, El Sonbaty and Markus Rühl who all came in with some of their best physiques ever. The competition went on to be known as &quot; &#x27;The Greatest Show on Earth&#x27; &quot; and the final trio: Coleman, Wheeler and Levrone in this contest is regarded as the best top three ever on stage at the same time. Coleman&#x27;s side chest pose from this competition ranks among the best ever.

At 1999 Mr. Olympia held at the iconic Mandalay Bay Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, Coleman successfully defended his title after defeating the likes of Wheeler, Chris Cormier, Levrone, Ray, El Sonbaty, Paul Dillett, Lee Priest, Mike Matarazzo, Jean Pierre Fux and Pavol Jablonický. He was heavier than last year at but brought same level of dryness and conditioning. Several experts and fellow IFBB pros including Milos Sarcev recognize this version to be Coleman&#x27;s best physique. He also won 1999 World Pro Championships and still was working full-time at Arlington Police Department, being 2x Mr. Olympia champion.

=== 2000 ===
Coleman started 2000 with easily winning 2000 IFBB English Grand Prix and 2000 World Pro Championships. At 2000 Mr. Olympia held again at Mandalay Bay Arena in Las Vegas, Coleman won his third consecutive title with it being also the third consecutive time he secured perfect scores following 1998 and 1999 (5 points in each four rounds during prejudging and finals for an ultimate score of 20). Levrone emerged second, Wheeler third, Ray fourth and El Sonbaty fifth. Coleman also became only the sixth person after Sergio Oliva, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Zane, Haney and Yates to win 3 Mr. Olympia titles in a row.

=== 2001 ===
In 2001, Coleman started the year with winning the 2001 Arnold Classic. He is noted for his conditioning in this competition. In addition to the prize money, he won a Hummer H1. Cormier emerged 2nd while Dennis James took 3rd. Then he proceeded to win 2001 IFBB New Zealand Grand Prix.

At 2001 Mr. Olympia held again at Mandalay Bay Arena in Las Vegas, he faced a formidable challenge from upcoming Jay Cutler, but successfully defended his title with a four-point lead to win his 4th consecutive Mr. Olympia title. Coleman also made history by becoming the first person in history to win both Mr. Olympia and Arnold Classic in the same calendar year.

=== 2002 ===
As advised by one of the judges the previous year, Coleman tried to come a bit leaner for the 2002 Mr. Olympia. Therefore instead of his standard 12-week cutting down period, he started 16 weeks prior which resulted in a slight loss of muscle mass which was clearly evident in his arms and legs. However, he edged Levrone to win his fifth consecutive title, in what happens to be a very close call according to many experts and critiques. Cormier took 3rd, Jackson took 4th and Günter Schlierkamp took 5th place. Bodyonics Pinnacle company gifted Coleman a Cadillac Escalade.

Coleman also won 2002 IFBB Dutch Grand Prix but came 2nd to Schlierkamp at 2002 Show of Strength Pro Championships, which was the only time he was defeated during his Olympia reign.

=== 2003 ===
In 2003, Coleman made massive improvements to his physique and came in for 2003 Mr. Olympia at a staggering on-stage weight and ripped. Cutler, who had taken last year off described, even though he came well prepared and with confidence to dethrone the champion, the minute Coleman took his clothes off backstage, his mouth dropped and he knew it was game-over. Levrone quoted &quot;&quot;Ronnie Coleman had reached a point, where he didn&#x27;t look human backstage. It looked like a Silverback Gorilla. &#x27;It&#x27; was part human, part gorilla&quot;.&quot; Jackson described him as the most dominant physique in history to ever grace a bodybuilding stage. Wheeler described Coleman&#x27;s rear double biceps and rear lat spread poses were perfection from top to bottom and ranked the two poses among the greatest ever. Olympia head-judge Steve Weinberger said that Coleman brought a level of muscularity the world has never seen before or since. Coleman secured a perfect score and convincingly won his 6th title, tying his predecessor Yates as the joint-third most decorated Olympian in history. He also won his second Cadillac Escalade courtesy of Pinnacle Supplements.

Coleman did one more show that year, 2003 IFBB Russian Grand Prix, coming in even bigger than he came for the Olympia. It was another easy victory, taking Coleman&#x27;s IFBB winning tally to 20, equaling Levrone.

=== 2004 ===
At 2004 Mr. Olympia, for the first time judges initiated a challenge round, where the top 6 finalists called out each other for a one-on-one pose comparison of their choice. Overall scores after round three was discarded, and the new challenge round standings were used to decide the winner. Coleman who came even bigger at , out-weighing even Markus Rühl won the competition tying Schwarzenegger for 7 titles, becoming the joint-second most decorated Olympian in history. Cutler emerged 2nd to Coleman for the third time and Gustavo Badell secured 3rd place, followed by Jackson, Rühl and Schlierkamp.

Next came a phase where Coleman reached his heaviest ever on-stage weight, coming in between for 2004 IFBB English Grand Prix, 2004 IFBB Dutch Grand Prix and 2004 IFBB Russian Grand Prix, winning all three and surpassing Vince Taylor to become the most decorated professional bodybuilder of all-time.

=== 2005 ===
At 2005 Mr. Olympia, announcer Mike Adamle introduced Coleman who was dressed in a medieval King&#x27;s costume with the words &quot; &quot;On the Seventh day God didn&#x27;t rest, on the Seventh day God created Ronnie Coleman...&quot; &quot; as Coleman held off Cutler, Badell, Schlierkamp, Víctor Martínez and James in a challenge round judged by previous rivals to win his 8th consecutive Mr. Olympia, equaling Haney as the most decorated Olympian in history. As soon as he was crowned the 8x time champion, IFBB president Ben Weider indicated that Coleman goes down in history as the greatest Mr. Olympia of all-time. Coleman won his biggest prize money of $150,000 for his victory.

=== 2006 to 2007 ===
Coleman&#x27;s dominant reign as Mr. Olympia finally came to an end in 2006 Mr. Olympia where four-times his runner-up Jay Cutler edged him to earn his first title. Coleman came with the biggest upper arms he ever posed on stage at over in contest shape, but his clearly visible lat asymmetry cost him a 9th title. Coleman made his final appearance at 2007 Mr. Olympia where he placed 4th, and soon announced his retirement.

==Legacy and in popular culture==

Movie director Mitsuru Okabe produced training videos of Coleman, including &quot;The First Training Video&quot; (1998), &quot;The Unbelievable&quot; (2000), &quot;The Cost of Redemption&quot; (2003), &quot;Relentless&quot; (2006) and &quot;On the Road&quot;. With his high-pitched voice, many of the lifts and vocal gimmicks Coleman popularized in them have become commonplace in the global physical culture community, especially after the advent of viral videos. The most popular of these, which he regularly shouted to himself as a form of self-encouragement, include &quot;Yeah buddy!&quot;, &quot;Light weight, baby!&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; but a peanut!&quot;, &quot;Nothin&#x27; to it, but to do it!&quot;, &quot;Everybody wants to be a bodybuilder, but nobody wants to lift no heavy-ass weights&quot;.

Coleman&#x27;s success as a professional bodybuilder has led to many product endorsements and other opportunities in his career, which he has traveled the world to promote. He has made many guest appearances around the world. Coleman was the recipient of the 2001 Admiral in the Texas Navy Certificate Award from Texas Governor Rick Perry for outstanding achievements in bodybuilding and for the promotion of physical fitness. He was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2016, and was awarded the &#x27;Arnold Schwarzenegger Lifetime Achievement Award&#x27; in 2021. Coleman is a supporter of Inner-City Games, co-founded by Schwarzenegger in 1991.

In 2011, Coleman launched Ronnie Coleman Signature Series (RCSS), a supplement company that provides sports nutrition and wellness products for bodybuilders and other athletes. Products such as &#x27;King Whey&#x27; whey protein, &#x27;King Mass&#x27; weight gainer and pre-workout product &#x27;Yeah buddy&#x27; are among some of the bestsellers.

In 2018, Vlad Yudin documented Coleman&#x27;s life and career in the Netflix documentary &quot;Ronnie Coleman: The King&quot;. For the film&#x27;s credits, rapper Quan made a song called &quot;Flexin&#x27; on Them (Ronnie Coleman)&quot; inspired by Coleman&#x27;s bodybuilding career.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Coleman met Vickie Gates (who later went on to become 3x times IFBB Ms. International champion) at a local GNC store. She was his girlfriend for nearly 7 years. In 1998, Coleman met French-Lebanese personal trainer Rouaida Christine Achkar at a sports exposition in Paris, and they got married in 2007. However, they divorced soon after.

In 2016, Coleman married his long time girlfriend, American personal trainer Susan Williamson. They reside in Arlington, Texas, along with their four daughters. Coleman is a devout Christian and a family man.

==Nutrition==
Coleman was noted for eating around 6,000 calories a day during his prime. He also followed a strict diet regime sticking to basics such as grilled chicken breasts, turkey breasts, steak, egg whites, rice, baked potatoes and grits with cheese, eating six meals a day. His daily protein intake was 600g and the daily carbohydrate intake differed from 100-1000g depending on the cutting or bulking phase.

==Health concerns==
The extreme weights Coleman used over the years took a toll on his body, and he has undergone more than a dozen surgeries since 2007. These include double hip replacements and various attempts at alleviating chronic pain from damaged intervertebral discs costing millions. Despite using a wheelchair because he can no longer walk unassisted due to surgical procedures, Coleman continues to train, but uses only light weights now. Coleman has always said that he does not regret his choices and admits that he was determined to be the best bodybuilder he could be at any cost; even saying that, if anything, he regrets not having done even more to consolidate his legacy.

<doc id="525655" wikidata="Q1049837" url="?curid=525655" title="Quoted-printable">
<text>Quoted-Printable, or QP encoding, is a binary-to-text encoding system using printable ASCII characters (alphanumeric and the equals sign codice_1) to transmit 8-bit data over a 7-bit data path or, generally, over a medium which is not 8-bit clean. Historically, because of the wide range of systems and protocols that could be used to transfer messages, e-mail was often assumed to be non-8-bit-clean – however, modern SMTP servers &quot;are&quot; in most cases 8-bit clean and support codice_2 extension. It can also be used with data that contains non-permitted octets or line lengths exceeding SMTP limits. It is defined as a MIME content transfer encoding for use in e-mail.

QP works by using the equals sign codice_1 as an escape character. It also limits line length to 76, as some software has limits on line length.

== Introduction ==
MIME defines mechanisms for sending other kinds of information in e-mail, including text in languages other than English, using character encodings other than ASCII. However, these encodings often use byte values outside the ASCII range so they need to be encoded further before they are suitable for use in a non-8-bit-clean environment. Quoted-Printable encoding is one method used for mapping arbitrary bytes into sequences of ASCII characters. So, Quoted-Printable is not a character encoding scheme itself, but a data coding layer to be used under some byte-oriented character encoding. QP encoding is reversible, meaning the original bytes and hence the non-ASCII characters they represent can be identically recovered.

Quoted-Printable and Base64 are the two MIME content transfer encodings, if the trivial &quot;7bit&quot; and &quot;8bit&quot; encoding are not counted. If the text to be encoded does not contain many non-ASCII characters, then Quoted-Printable results in a fairly readable and compact encoded result. On the other hand, if the input has many 8-bit characters, then Quoted-Printable becomes both unreadable and extremely inefficient. Base64 is not human-readable, but has a uniform overhead for all data and is the more sensible choice for binary formats or text in a script other than the Latin script.

== Quoted-printable encoding ==
Any 8-bit byte value may be encoded with 3 characters: an codice_1 followed by two hexadecimal digits (0–9 or A–F) representing the byte&#x27;s numeric value. For example, an ASCII form feed character (decimal value 12) can be represented by codice_5, and an ASCII equal sign (decimal value 61) must be represented by codice_6. All characters except printable ASCII characters or end of line characters (but also codice_1) must be encoded in this fashion.

All printable ASCII characters (decimal values between 33 and 126) may be represented by themselves, except codice_1 (decimal 61, hexadecimal 3D, therefore codice_6).

ASCII tab and space characters, decimal values 9 and 32, may be represented by themselves, except if these characters would appear at the end of the encoded line. In that case, they would need to be escaped as codice_10 (tab) or codice_11 (space), or be followed by a codice_1 (soft line break) as the last character of the encoded line. This last solution is valid because it prevents the tab or space from being the last character of the encoded line.

If the data being encoded contains meaningful line breaks, they must be encoded as an ASCII CR LF sequence, not as their original byte values, neither directly nor via codice_1 signs. Conversely, if byte values 13 and 10 have meanings other than end of line (in media types, for example), then they must be encoded as codice_14 and codice_15 respectively.

Lines of Quoted-Printable encoded data must not be longer than 76 characters. To satisfy this requirement without altering the encoded text, &quot;soft line breaks&quot; may be added as desired. A soft line break consists of an codice_1 at the end of an encoded line, and does not appear as a line break in the decoded text. These soft line breaks also allow encoding text without line breaks (or containing very long lines) for an environment where line size is limited, such as the 1000 characters per line limit of some SMTP software, as allowed by RFC 2821.

A slightly modified version of Quoted-Printable is used in message headers; see MIME#Encoded-Word.

== Example ==
The following example is a French text (encoded in UTF-8), with a high frequency of letters with diacritical marks (such as the &quot;é&quot;).

<doc id="525667" wikidata="Q1920844" url="?curid=525667" title="Human echolocation">
<text>Human echolocation is the ability of humans to detect objects in their environment by sensing echoes from those objects, by actively creating sounds: for example, by tapping their canes, lightly stomping their foot, snapping their fingers, or making clicking noises with their mouths. People trained to orient by echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects, accurately identifying their location and size.

==Background==

The term &quot;echolocation&quot; was coined by zoologist Donald Griffin in 1944. But the phenomena was known about earlier, for example, Denis Diderot reported in 1749 that blind people could locate silent objects. Human echolocation has been known and formally studied since at least the 1950s. In earlier times, human echolocation was sometimes described as &quot;facial vision&quot; or &quot;obstacle sense&quot;, as it was believed that the proximity of nearby objects caused pressure changes on the skin. Only in the 1940s did a series of experiments performed in the Cornell Psychological Laboratory show that sound and hearing, rather than pressure changes on the skin, were the mechanisms driving this ability. The field of human and animal echolocation was surveyed in book form as early as 1959 (see also White, et al. (1970)).

Many blind individuals passively use natural environmental echoes to sense details about their environment; however, others actively produce mouth clicks and are able to gauge information about their environment using the echoes from those clicks. Both passive and active echolocation help blind individuals sense their environments.

Those who can see their environments often do not readily perceive echoes from nearby objects, due to an echo suppression phenomenon brought on by the precedence effect. However, with training, sighted individuals with normal hearing can learn to avoid obstacles using only sound, showing that echolocation is a general human ability. John Levack Drever refers to echolocation in humans an example of panacusi loci, spatial hearing that exceeds the prescribed normative mode.

Lore Thaler led researchers at Durham University to determine if they could teach echolocation to people. Over a ten-week period, they taught it to 12 blind people and 14 others who were not blind.

==Mechanics==
Vision and hearing are akin in that each entails detection of reflected waves of energy. Vision processes light waves that travel from their source, bounce off surfaces throughout the environment and enter the eyes. Similarly, the auditory system processes sound waves as they travel from their source, bounce off surfaces and enter the ears. Both neural systems can extract a great deal of information about the environment by interpreting the complex patterns of reflected energy that their sense organs receive. In the case of sound these waves of reflected energy are referred to as echoes.

Echoes and other sounds can convey spatial data that are comparable in many respects to those conveyed by light. A blind traveler using echoes can perceive very complex, detailed, and specific features of the world from distances far beyond the reach of the longest cane or arm. Echoes can make information available about the nature and arrangement of objects and environmental features such as overhangs, walls, doorways and recesses, poles, ascending curbs and steps, planter boxes, pedestrians, fire hydrants, parked or moving vehicles, trees and other foliage, and much more. Echoes can give detailed information about location (where objects are), dimension (how big they are and their general shape), and density (how solid they are). Location is generally broken down into distance from the observer and direction (left/right, front/back, high/low). Dimension refers to the object&#x27;s height (tall or short) and breadth (wide or narrow).

By understanding the interrelationships of these qualities, much can be perceived about the nature of an object or multiple objects. For example, an object that is tall and narrow may be recognized quickly as a pole. An object that is tall and narrow near the bottom while broad near the top would be a tree. Something that is tall and very broad registers as a wall or building. Something that is broad and tall in the middle, while being shorter at either end may be identified as a parked car. An object that is low and broad may be a planter, retaining wall, or curb. And finally, something that starts out close and very low but recedes into the distance as it gets higher is a set of steps. Density refers to the solidity of the object (solid/sparse, hard/soft). Awareness of density adds richness and complexity to one&#x27;s available information. For instance, an object that is low and solid may be recognized as a table, while something low and sparse sounds like a bush; but an object that is tall and broad and very sparse is probably a fence.

===Brain areas associated with echolocation===
 Some blind people are skilled at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes. Although few studies have been performed on the neural basis of human echolocation, those studies report activation of primary visual cortex during echolocation in blind expert echolocators. The driving mechanism of this brain region remapping phenomenon is known as neuroplasticity.

In a 2014 study by Thaler and colleagues, the researchers first made recordings of the clicks and their very faint echoes using tiny microphones placed in the ears of the blind echolocators as they stood outside and tried to identify different objects such as a car, a flag pole, and a tree. The researchers then played the recorded sounds back to the echolocators while their brain activity was being measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Remarkably, when the echolocation recordings were played back to the blind experts, not only did they perceive the objects based on the echoes, but they also showed activity in those areas of their brain that normally process visual information in sighted people, primarily the primary visual cortex or V1. This result is surprising, as visual areas are normally only active during visual tasks. The brain areas that process auditory information were no more activated by sound recordings of outdoor scenes containing echoes than they were by sound recordings of outdoor scenes with the echoes removed. Importantly, when the same experiment was carried out with sighted people who did not echolocate, these individuals could not perceive the objects and there was no echo-related activity anywhere in the brain. This suggests that the cortex of blind echolocators is plastic and reorganizes such that primary visual cortex, rather than any auditory area, becomes involved in the computation of echolocation tasks.

Despite this evidence, the extent to which activation in the visual cortex in blind echolocators contributes to echolocation abilities is unclear. As previously mentioned, sighted individuals have the ability to echolocate; however, they do not show comparable activation in visual cortex. This would suggest that sighted individuals use areas beyond visual cortex for echolocation.

Echolocation has been further developed by Daniel Kish, who works with the blind through the non-profit organization World Access for the Blind. He leads blind teenagers hiking and mountain-biking through the wilderness, and teaches them how to navigate new locations safely, with a technique that he calls &quot;FlashSonar&quot;. Kish had his eyes removed at the age of 13 months due to retinal cancer. He learned to make palatal clicks with his tongue when he was still a child, and now trains other blind people in the use of echolocation and in what he calls &quot;Perceptual Mobility&quot;. Though at first resistant to using a cane for mobility, seeing it as a &quot;handicapped&quot; device, and considering himself &quot;not handicapped at all&quot;, Kish developed a technique using his white cane combined with echolocation to further expand his mobility.

Kish reports that &quot;The sense of imagery is very rich for an experienced user. One can get a sense of beauty or starkness or whatever—from sound as well as echo.&quot; He is able to distinguish a metal fence from a wooden one by the information returned by the echoes on the arrangement of the fence structures; in extremely quiet conditions, he can also hear the warmer and duller quality of the echoes from wood compared to metal.

===Thomas Tajo===
Thomas Tajo was born in the remote Himalayan village of Chayangtajo in the state of Arunachal Pradesh in the north-east India. He became blind around the age of 7 or 8 due to optic nerve atrophy and taught himself to echolocate. Today he lives in Belgium and works with Visioneers or World Access to impart independent navigational skills to blind individuals across the world. Tajo is also an independent researcher. He researches the cultural and biological evolutionary history of the senses and presents his findings to scientific conferences around the world.

===Ben Underwood===

Ben Underwood was a blind American who was born on January 26, 1992, in Riverside, California. He was diagnosed with retinal cancer at the age of two, and had his eyes removed at the age of three.

He taught himself echolocation at the age of five, becoming able to detect the location of objects by making frequent clicking noises with his tongue. This case was explained in &quot;20/20: Medical Mysteries&quot;. He used it to accomplish such feats as running, playing basketball, riding a bicycle, rollerblading, playing football, and skateboarding. Underwood&#x27;s childhood eye doctor claimed that Underwood was one of the most proficient human echolocators.

He inspired other blind people to follow his lead. He died of cancer in 2009.

===Lawrence Scadden===

Lawrence Scadden lost his sight as a child due to illness, but learned to use echolocation well enough to ride a bicycle in traffic. (His parents thought that he still had some sight remaining.) In 1998, he was interviewed at the Auditory Neuroethology Laboratory at the University of Maryland about his experience with echolocation. The researchers were aware of the &quot;Wiederorientierung&quot; phenomenon described by Griffin where bats, despite continuing to emit echolocation calls, use path integration in familiar acoustic space. Scadden said he did the same, as echolocation required extra effort.

The National Science Teachers Association created the &quot;Lawrence A. Scadden Outstanding Teacher Award of the Year for Students With Disabilities&quot; in his honor.

===Lucas Murray===
Lucas Murray, from Poole, Dorset, was born blind, and is one of the first British people to have learned human echolocation, having learned it from Daniel Kish. Lucas&#x27; parents saw a documentary about Daniel Kish teaching Ben Underwood echolocation. Months later, they learned that Daniel would be visiting a Scottish charity called Visibility and contacted him. Kish taught the five-year-old Lucas the basics of echolocation over four days. By age seven, Lucas was proficient enough to not only accurately tell the distance of objects, but also their material, and could play with other children in sports such as rock climbing and basketball. In 2019, he enjoyed a week&#x27;s work experience with South Western Railway.

===Kevin Warwick===

The scientist Kevin Warwick experimented with feeding ultrasonic pulses into the brain (via electrical stimulation from a neural implant) as an additional sensory input. In tests he was able to discern distance to objects accurately and to detect small movements of those objects.

===Juan Ruiz===

Blind from birth, Juan Ruiz lives in Los Angeles, California. He appeared in the first episode of &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Superhumans&quot;, titled &quot;Electro Man&quot;. The episode showed him capable of riding a bicycle, avoiding parked cars and other obstacles, and identifying nearby objects. He entered and exited a cave, where he determined its length and other features.

==In popular media==
The 2017 video game &quot;Perception&quot; places the player in the role of a blind woman who must use echolocation to navigate the environment.

In the 2012 film &quot;Imagine&quot;, the main character teaches echolocation to students at a clinic for the visually impaired. This unconventional method spurs a controversy but helps students explore the world.

In the 2007 children&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;Gregor and the Code of Claw&quot;, protagonist Gregor learns echolocation. This skill proves useful for fighting in the Underland, an underground civilization which is the main setting of the book.

The Marvel character Daredevil is a superhero who uses his heightened senses paired with echolocation to perceive the world in extraordinary detail.

<doc id="525669" wikidata="Q1774112" url="?curid=525669" title="Kolyma">
<text>Kolyma (, ) or Kolyma Krai () is a historical region in the Russian Far East that includes the basin of Kolyma River and the northern shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, as well as the Kolyma Mountains (the watershed of the two). It is bounded to the north by the East Siberian Sea and the Arctic Ocean, and by the Sea of Okhotsk to the south. Kolyma Krai was never formally defined and over time it was split among various administrative units. , it consists roughly of the Magadan Oblast, north-eastern areas of Yakutia, and the Bilibinsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug.

The area, part of which is within the Arctic Circle, has a subarctic climate with very cold winters lasting up to six months of the year. Permafrost and tundra cover a large part of the region. Average winter temperatures range from (even lower in the interior), and average summer temperatures, from . There are rich reserves of gold, silver, tin, tungsten, mercury, copper, antimony, coal, oil, and peat. Twenty-nine zones of possible oil and gas accumulation have been identified in the Sea of Okhotsk shelf. Total reserves are estimated at 3.5 billion tons of equivalent fuel, including 1.2 billion tons of oil and 1.5 billion m3 of gas.

The principal town Magadan has nearly 100,000 inhabitants and is the largest port in north-eastern Siberia. It has a large fishing fleet and remains open year-round because of icebreakers. Magadan is served by the nearby Sokol Airport. There are many public and private farming enterprises. Gold mines, pasta and sausage factories, fishing companies, and a distillery form the city&#x27;s industrial base.

==Prehistory==
During archaeological investigations of Paleolithic sites on the Angara, in 1936 the unique Stone Age site of Buret’ was discovered which yielded an anthropomorphic sculpture, skulls of rhinoceroses, and surface and semisubterranean dwellings. The houses were analogous, on one hand, to Paleolithic European houses and, on the other, to ethnographically studied houses of the Eskimos, Chukchi and Koryaks.

The indigenous peoples of this region include the Evens, Koryaks, Yupiks, Chukchis, Orochs, Chuvans and Itelmens, who traditionally lived from fishing along the Sea of Okhotsk coast or from reindeer herding in the River Kolyma valley.

==History==

Under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule, The Kolyma Gulag (Колыма гулаг, колымский гулаг) became the most notorious region for the Gulag labor camps. Tens of thousands or more people died en route to the area or in the Kolyma&#x27;s series of gold mining, road building, lumbering, and construction camps between 1932 and 1954. It was Kolyma&#x27;s reputation that caused Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, author of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, to characterize it as the &quot;pole of cold and cruelty&quot; in the Gulag system. The Mask of Sorrow monument in Magadan commemorates all those who died in the Kolyma forced-labour camps and the recently dedicated Church of the Nativity remembers the victims in its icons and Stations of the Camps.

===Emergence of the Gulag camps===

Gold and platinum were discovered in the region in the early 20th century. During the time of the USSR&#x27;s industrialization (beginning with Joseph Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan, 1928–1932) the need for capital to finance economic development was great. The abundant gold resources of the area seemed tailor-made to provide this capital. A government agency Dalstroy (, acronym for &quot;Far North Construction Trust&quot;) was formed to organize the exploitation of the area. Prisoners were being drawn into the Soviet penal system in large numbers during the initial period of Kolyma&#x27;s development, most notably from the so-called anti-Kulak campaign and the government&#x27;s internal war to force collectivization on the USSR&#x27;s peasantry. These prisoners formed a readily available workforce.

The initial efforts to develop the region began in 1932, with the building of the town of Magadan by forced labor. (Many projects in the USSR were already using forced labor, most notably the White Sea–Baltic Canal.) After a gruelling train ride in unheated boxcars on the Trans-Siberian Railway, prisoners were disembarked at one of several transit camps (such as Nakhodka and later Vanino) and transported across the Sea of Okhotsk to the natural harbor chosen for Magadan&#x27;s construction. Conditions aboard the ships were harsh. According to a 1987 article in &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;During the 1930s the only way to reach Magadan was by ship from Khabarovsk, which created an island psychology and the term Gulag archipelago. Within the crowded prison ships thousands died during transportation. One survivor&#x27;s memoir recounts that the prison ship SS Dzhurma was caught in the autumn ice in 1933 while trying to get to the mouth of the Kolyma River. When it reached port the following spring, it carried only crew and guards. All 12,000 prisoners were missing, left dead on the ice.&quot; It turns out that this incident, widely reported since it was first mentioned in a book published in 1947, could not have happened as the ship &quot;Dzhurma&quot; was not in Soviet hands until mid 1935.

In 1932 expeditions pushed their way into the interior of the Kolyma, embarking on the construction of the Kolyma Highway, which was to become known as the Road of Bones. Eventually, about 80 different camps dotted the region of the uninhabited taiga.

The original director of the Kolyma camps was Eduard Berzin, a Cheka officer. Berzin was later removed (1937) and shot during the period of the Great Purges in the USSR.

====The Arctic camps====
At the height of the Purges, around 1937, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s account imagines camp commander Naftaly Frenkel as establishing the new law of the Archipelago: &quot;We have to squeeze everything out of a prisoner in the first three months—after that we don&#x27;t need him anymore.&quot; But there is no documentary evidence of this beyond Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s speculation. The system of hard labor and minimal or no food reduced most prisoners to helpless &quot;goners&quot; (&quot;dokhodyaga&quot;, in Russian). Conditions varied depending on the state of the country.

Many of the prisoners in Kolyma were academics or intellectuals. They included Mikhail Kravchuk (Krawtschuk), a Ukrainian mathematician who by the early 1930s had received considerable acclaim in the West. After a summary trial, apparently for reluctance to take part in the accusations of some of his colleagues, he was sent to Kolyma where he died in 1942. Hard work in the labor camp, harsh climate and meager food, poor health as well as accusations and abandonment by most of his colleagues, took their toll. Kravchuk perished in Magadan in Eastern Siberia, about 4,000 miles (6,000 km) from the place where he was born. Kravchuk&#x27;s last article had appeared soon after his arrest in 1938. However, after this publication, Kravchuk&#x27;s name was stricken from books and journals.


The prisoner population of Kolyma increased substantially in 1946 with the arrival of thousands of former Soviet POWs liberated by Western Allied forces or the Red Army at the close of World War II.
Those judged guilty of collaboration with the enemy frequently received ten or twenty-five year prison sentences to the gulag, including Kolyma.

There were, however, some exceptions. Rumor suggested that Soviet agents seized Léon Theremin, an inventor, in the United States and forced him to return to the Soviet Union; he actually returned voluntarily. Joseph Stalin had Theremin imprisoned at the Butyrka in Moscow; he later came to work in the Kolyma gold mines. Although rumors of his execution circulated widely, Theremin was, in fact, put to work in a sharashka (a secret research-laboratory), together with other scientists and engineers, including aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev and rocket scientist Sergei Korolyov (also a Kolyma inmate). The Soviet Union rehabilitated Theremin in 1956.

The Kolyma camps switched to using (mostly) free labor after 1954, and in 1956 Nikita Khrushchev ordered a general amnesty that freed many prisoners. Various estimates have put the Kolyma death-toll from 1930 to the mid-1950s between 250,000 and over a million people.

====Dalstroy officials====
Dalstroy was the agency created to manage exploitation of the Kolyma area, based principally on the use of forced labour.

In the words of Azerbaijani prisoner Ayyub Baghirov, &quot;The entire administration of the Dalstroy—economic, administrative, physical and political—was in the hands of one person who was invested with many rights and privileges.&quot; The officials in charge of Dalstroy, i.e., the Kolyma Gulag camps were:
* Eduard Petrovich Berzin, 1932–1937
* Karp Aleksandrovich Pavlov, 1937–1939.
* Ivan Fedorovich Nikishev, 1940–1948.
* Ivan Grigorevich Petrenko, 1948–1950.
* I.L. Mitrakov, from 1950 until Dalstroy was taken over by the Ministry of Metallurgy on 18 March 1953.

====Calendar of historical events====

*1957: Dalstroy liquidated. Many of the former prisoners continued to work in the mines with a modified status and a few new prisoners arrived, at least until the early 1970s.

===Post-Dalstroy developments===
The Chukot Autonomous Okrug site provides details of developments after the official closure of the camps. In 1953, the Magadan Oblast (or region) was established. Dalstroy was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Metallurgy and later to the Ministry of Non-Ferrous Metallurgy.

====Industrial and economic evolution====
Industrial gold-mining started in 1958 leading to the development of mining settlements, industrial enterprises, power plants, hydro-electric dams, power transmission lines and improved roads. By the 1960s, the region&#x27;s population exceeded 100,000.
With the dissolution of Dalstroy, the Soviets adopted new labor policies. While the prison labor was still important, it mainly consisted of common criminals. New manpower was recruited from all Soviet nationalities on a voluntary basis, to make up for the sudden lack of political prisoners. Young men and women were lured to the frontier land of Kolyma with the promise of high earnings and better living. But many decided to leave.
The region&#x27;s prosperity suffered under Soviet liberal policies in the end of the 1980s and 1990s with a considerable reduction in population, apparently by 40% in Magadan. A U.S. report from the late 1990s gives details of the region&#x27;s economic shortfall citing outdated equipment, bankruptcies of local companies and lack of central support. It does however report substantial investments from the United States and the governor&#x27;s optimism for future prosperity based on revival of the mining industries.

====Last political prisoners====
Dalstroy and the camps did not close down completely. The Kolyma authority, which was reorganised in 1958/59 (31 December 1958), finally closed in 1968. However the mining activities did not stop. Indeed, government structures still exist today under the Ministry of Natural Resources. In some cases, the same individuals seem to have stayed on over the years under new management.
There are indications that the political prisoners were gradually phased out over the years but it was only as a result of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s far reaching reforms in the 1990s that the very last prisoners were released from Kolyma.
The Russian author Andrei Amalrik appears to have been one of the last high-profile political prisoners to be sent to Kolyma. In 1970, he published two books: &quot;Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?&quot; and &quot;Involuntary Journey to Siberia&quot;. As a result, he was arrested for &quot;defaming the Soviet state&quot; in November 1970 and sentenced to hard labour, apparently in Kolyma, for what turned out to be a total of almost five years.

==Accounts of the Kolyma Gulag camps==
=== Varlam Shalamov ===
A detailed description of conditions in the camps is provided by Varlam Shalamov in his &quot;Kolyma Tales&quot;. In &quot;Dry Rations&quot; he writes: &quot;Each time they brought in the soup... it made us all want to cry. We were ready to cry for fear that the soup would be thin. And when a miracle occurred and the soup was thick we couldn’t believe it and ate it as slowly as possible. But even with thick soup in a warm stomach there remained a sucking pain; we’d been hungry for too long. All human emotions—love, friendship, envy, concern for one&#x27;s fellow man, compassion, longing for fame, honesty—had left us with the flesh that had melted from our bodies...&quot;

=== Michael M. Solomon ===
During and after the Second World War the region saw major influxes of Ukrainian, Polish, German, Japanese, and Korean prisoners. There is a particularly memorable account written by a Jewish Romanian survivor, Michael M. Solomon, in his book &quot;Magadan&quot; (see Bibliography below) which gives us a vivid picture of both the transit camps leading to the Kolyma and the region itself. Hungarian George Bien, author of the &quot;Lost Years&quot;, also recounts the horrors of Kolyma. His story has also led to a film.

=== Vladimir Nikolayevich Petrov ===
&quot;Soviet Gold&quot;, the first autobiographical book written by Vladimir Nikolayevich Petrov, is almost entirely a description of the author&#x27;s life in Magadan and the Kolyma gold fields.

=== Ayyub Baghirov ===
In &quot;Bitter Days of Kolyma&quot;, Ayyub Baghirov, an Azerbaijani accountant who was finally rehabilitated, provides details of his arrest, torture and sentencing to eight (finally to become 18) years imprisonment in a labour camp for refusing to incriminate a fellow official for financial irregularities. Describing the train journey to Siberia, he writes: &quot;The terrible heat, the lack of fresh air, the unbearable overcrowded conditions all exhausted us. We were all half starved. Some of the elderly prisoners, who had become so weak and emaciated, died along the way. Their corpses were left abandoned alongside the railroad tracks.&quot;

=== Brother Gene Thompson ===
A vivid account of the conditions in Kolyma is that of Brother Gene Thompson of Kiev&#x27;s Faith Mission. He recounts how he met Vyacheslav Palman, a prisoner who survived because he knew how to grow cabbages. Palman spoke of how guards read out the names of those to be shot every evening. On one occasion a group of 169 men were shot and thrown into a pit. Their fully clothed bodies were found after the ice melted in 1998.

=== Vadim Kozin ===
One of the most famous political prisoners in Kolyma was Vadim Kozin, possibly Russia&#x27;s most popular romantic tenor, who was sent to the camps in February 1945, apparently for refusing to write a song about Stalin. Although he was initially freed in 1950 and could return to his singing career, he was soon framed by his enemies on charges of homosexuality and sent back to the camps. Though released once again several years later, he was never officially rehabilitated and remained in exile in Magadan where he died in 1994. Speaking to journalists in 1982, he explained how he had been forced to tour the camps: &quot;The Polit bureau formed brigades which would, under surveillance, go on tours of the concentration camps and perform for the prisoners and the guards, including those of the highest rank.&quot;
In 1993, while being interviewed by Theo Uittenbogaard for the TV documentary &quot;Gold – Lost in Siberia&quot; , he recalled how he was released from exile temporarily and flown into Yalta for a few hours, because Winston Churchill, unaware of Kozin&#x27;s forced exile, had asked Stalin for the famous singer Vadim Kozin to perform, during a break in the Yalta Conference, held February 4–11, 1945.

=== Yevgenia Ginzburg ===
In her autobiographical account &quot;Journey into the Whirlwind&quot;, academic Yevgenia Ginzburg details her persecution, arrest, trial, imprisonment, and exile to Kolyma. The book starts with a 4 a.m. phone call on the first of December 1934 calling for her to attend the regional committee office at 6 a.m. and follows the chain of events that ultimately lead to her exile to Kolyma, arriving in Magadan in the winter of 1939. Part 2 chapters 5 to 9 cover her time in Kolyma, first working on land improvements, and then being sent to the &quot;state farm&quot; of Elgen, sometimes El&#x27;gen, Russian Эльген, to fell trees.

&quot;During the 18 years of our ordeal, many times I found myself face to face with death, but it was an experience I never got used to...

To begin with, salvation from death in the Elgen forests came to me from cranberries, sour, bitter northern berries, not ripening at the end of summer as they would do in a normal climate, but remaining from the previous year, to be coaxed out of their hiding place by the timid Kolyma spring, after their ten months&#x27; sleep under the snow.&quot;

=== Nikolai Getman ===
Finally, Ukrainian prisoner Nikolai Getman who spent the years 1945–1953 in Kolyma, records his testimony in pictures rather than words. But he does have a plea: &quot;Some may say that the Gulag is a forgotten part of history and that we do not need to be reminded. But I have witnessed monstrous crimes. It is not too late to talk about them and reveal them. It is essential to do so. Some have expressed fear on seeing some of my paintings that I might end up in Kolyma again—this time for good. But the people must be reminded... of one of the harshest acts of political repression in the Soviet Union. My paintings may help achieve this.&quot; The Jamestown Foundation provides access to all 50 of Getman&#x27;s paintings together with explanations of their significance.

==Estimating the number of victims==

The amount of hard evidence in regard to Kolyma is extremely limited. Unfortunately, no reliable archives exist about the total number of victims of Stalinism; all numbers are estimates. In his book, &quot;Stalin&quot; (1996), Edvard Radzinsky explains how Stalin, while systematically destroying his comrades-in-arms &quot;at once obliterated every trace of them in history. He personally directed the constant and relentless purging of the archives.&quot; That practice continued to exist after the death of the dictator.

In an account of a visit to Magadan by Harry Wu in 1999, there is a reference to the efforts of Alexander Biryukov, a Magadan lawyer to document the terror. He is said to have compiled a book listing every one of the 11,000 people documented to have been shot in Kolyma camps by the state security organ, the NKVD. Biryukov, whose father was in the Gulag at the time he was born, has begun researching the location of graves. He believed some of the bodies were still partially preserved in the permafrost.

It is therefore impossible to provide final figures on the number of victims who died in Kolyma. Robert Conquest, author of &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, now admits that his original estimate of three million victims was far too high. In his article &quot;Death Tolls for the Man-made Megadeaths of the 20th Century&quot;, Matthew White estimates the number of those who died at 500,000. In &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Slave Ships&quot;, Martin Bollinger undertakes a careful analysis of the number of prisoners who could have been transported by ship to Magadan between 1932 and 1953 (some 900,000) and the probable number of deaths each year (averaging 27%). This produces figures significantly below earlier estimates but, as the author emphasizes, his calculations are by no means definitive. In addition to the number of deaths, the dreadful conditions of the camps and the hardships experienced by the prisoners over the years need to be taken into account. In his review of Bollinger&#x27;s book, Norman Polmar refers to 130,000 victims who died at Kolyma. As Bollinger reports in his book, the 3,000,000 estimate originated with the CIA in the 1950s and appears to be a flawed estimate. This number is also estimated by the last survivors.

Anne Applebaum, 2004 Pulitzer Prize winner for her book &quot;Gulag: A History&quot;, carried out an extensive investigation of the gulags. In a lecture in 2003, she explained that it&#x27;s extremely difficult not only to document the facts given the extent of the cover-up but to bring the truth home.

==Ecology==
This ecoregion encompasses the drainages of Arctic rivers from the Indigirka River eastward to Chaunskaya Guba Bay. In the west, the Indigirka River drainage is separated from the Khroma River and Yana rivers by the spurs of the Polousnyy Kryazh Range and the Chersky Range.

===Paleoecology===
During the Pleistocene the ecology of this part of Beringia was quite different from modern times, with the extinct woolly mammoth and the wooly rhinoceros being present.

The polar bear most likely evolved here.

The school, designed by the Manhattan-based architectural firm of Moore &amp; Hutchins, opened in 1956.

In recent years the school has undergone several renovations; these include the school&#x27;s commons and theater in 1990, library in 1993, and cafeteria in 1999. The school has completed a multimillion-dollar renovation that began in the summer of 2005. The entire construction project ended by the start of 2008–2009 school year. The entire campus also renovated the entrances, adding another one on the other side of Route 172, and revamping the older entrance with a traffic circle. Most recently in 2015, the main track and turf field was rebuilt. Shortly after the conclusion of the 2023 baseball season, the old baseball field was torn down and a new turf field began installation.

==Athletics==
The Fox Lane Foxes teams include football, field hockey, ice hockey, diving, volleyball, soccer, swimming, cross country, winter track, spring track, dance, cheerleading, basketball, skiing, wrestling, lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, softball, baseball, golf and tennis. The Fox Lane Varsity Football team, coached by Andrew Giuliano, faced cross-town rivals Horace Greeley in the 2023 Gridiron cup, and beat Greeley 27-6.

<text>The Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems or Tremblay Commission was called for by the premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis in 1953. The commission, chaired by Mr. Justice Thomas Tremblay, studied the problem of tax sharing between different levels of government and greater constitutional problems in Canada.

The commission held 97 public meetings throughout Quebec, received 217 briefs, launched several studies, and finally published a five-volume report in 1956. It proposed a maximum level of taxation be established, the provincial responsibility for unemployment benefits, and a shared personal and corporate tax scheme between the federal and provincial governments.

<text>Coreopsis () is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. Common names include calliopsis and tickseed, a name shared with various other plants.

==Description==
These plants range from in height. The flowers are usually yellow with a toothed tip, but can also be yellow-and-red bicolor or pink. They have showy flower heads with involucral bracts in two distinct series of eight each, the outer being commonly connate at the base. The flat fruits are small and dry and look like insects.

There are 75–80 species of &quot;Coreopsis&quot;, all of which are native to North, Central, and South America. The name &quot;Coreopsis&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words (), meaning &quot;bedbug&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;view&quot;, referring to the shape of the achene.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Coreopsis&quot; is a variable genus closely related to &quot;Bidens&quot;. In fact, neither &quot;Coreopsis&quot; nor &quot;Bidens&quot;, as defined in the 20th century, is strictly monophyletic. &quot;Coreopsis&quot; is best described as paraphyletic. Previously (1936), &quot;Coreopsis&quot; was classified into 11 sections and 114 species, but the African species were subsequently reclassified as &quot;Bidens&quot;, leaving the North and South American species, some 75–80 in all, under &quot;Coreopsis&quot;. 45 species are in the 11 North American sections, and the remaining 35 are in the South American section &quot;Pseudoagarista&quot;. The North American species fall into two broad groups, with 5 sections and 12 species in Mexico and North America and the remaining 5 sections and 26 species in Eastern North America.

One group which does seem to be monophyletic consists of temperate species from North America, including five sections of &quot;Coreopsis&quot;, &quot;Bidens coronata&quot; and &quot;Bidens tripartita&quot;, and the genus &quot;Thelesperma&quot; (five species).

==Distribution and habitat==
North American &quot;Coreopsis&quot; can be found in two habitats in the wild, growing along roadsides and open fields throughout the Eastern United States and Canada. In this environment the plant will self-sow.

==Ecology==
&quot;Coreopsis&quot; species are a source of nectar and pollen for insects. The species is known to provide food to caterpillars of some Lepidoptera species, including &quot;Coleophora acamtopappi&quot;.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Coreopsis&quot; can grow in a garden as a border plant, or in a container, preferring well-drained soil. Deadheading the flowers ensures it does not become weedy. Using the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) hardiness zones will identify what soil and climate is preferred for different cultivars or species. Notable species found in cultivation are &quot;C. grandiflora&quot; and &quot;C. verticillata&quot;, as well as their various cultivars.
The sunny, summer-blooming, daisy-like flowers are popularly planted in gardens to attract butterflies. Both annual and perennial types are grown in the home garden (USDA hardiness zone 7a/6b). In the Mid-Atlantic region, insects such as bees, hover flies, and wasps are often observed visiting the flowers.

== Culture ==
All &quot;Coreopsis&quot; species were designated the state wildflower of the U.S. state of Florida in 1991. In the language of flowers, &quot;Coreopsis&quot; means to be always cheerful, while &quot;Coreopsis arkansa&quot; in particular stands for love at first sight.

<text>Sir Michael Patrick Cashin, (29 September 1864 – 30 August 1926) was a Newfoundland businessman and politician.

He was elected to the legislature in 1893 as an independent but worked closely with the Liberal Party. In 1907 he joined the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party of Sir Edward Patrick Morris and became minister of finance in 1909. When Morris resigned as party leader, Cashin succeeded him. The People&#x27;s Party had formed a wartime national government which opposition member William F. Lloyd, a Liberal, had joined as minister of justice.

Despite the fact that Cashin had succeeded Morris as leader of the dominant party, the governor appointed Lloyd to the position of prime minister. On 20 May 1919, Cashin, who was still minister of finance, rose and moved a motion of no confidence in the government he was a member of. The motion passed and Cashin became prime minister.

Cashin&#x27;s government was short-lived, however; the House of Assembly had not seen an election for six years due to the First World War, and a return to the polls was long overdue. An election was held in November 1919 which defeated Cashin&#x27;s government and elected the opposition Liberals (now called the &quot;Liberal Reform Party&quot;).

In opposition Cashin changed the name of the People&#x27;s Party to the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party before retiring as party leader in 1923. He did not run for re-election in 1924.

Cashin&#x27;s son, Peter John Cashin, was a prominent Newfoundland politician in his own right and his grandson, Richard Cashin was a federal politician in the 1960s and a trade union leader in the 1970s and 1980s.

He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918.

He died at his home in St. John&#x27;s on 30 August 1926.

<doc id="525697" wikidata="Q3782642" url="?curid=525697" title="Ordered ring">
<text>In abstract algebra, an ordered ring is a (usually commutative) ring &quot;R&quot; with a total order ≤ such that for all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;R&quot;:

* if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; then &quot;a&quot; + &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; + &quot;c&quot;.
* if 0 ≤ &quot;a&quot; and 0 ≤ &quot;b&quot; then 0 ≤ &quot;ab&quot;.

==Examples==

Ordered rings are familiar from arithmetic. Examples include the integers, the rationals and the real numbers. (The rationals and reals in fact form ordered fields.) The complex numbers, in contrast, do not form an ordered ring or field, because there is no inherent order relationship between the elements 1 and &quot;i&quot;.

==Positive elements==
In analogy with the real numbers, we call an element &quot;c&quot; of an ordered ring &quot;R&quot; positive if 0 &lt; &quot;c&quot;, and negative if &quot;c&quot; &lt; 0. 0 is considered to be neither positive nor negative.

The set of positive elements of an ordered ring &quot;R&quot; is often denoted by &quot;R&quot;+. An alternative notation, favored in some disciplines, is to use &quot;R&quot;+ for the set of nonnegative elements, and &quot;R&quot;++ for the set of positive elements.

==Absolute value==

If formula_1 is an element of an ordered ring &quot;R&quot;, then the absolute value of formula_2, denoted formula_3, is defined thus:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the additive inverse of formula_2 and 0 is the additive identity element.

==Discrete ordered rings==

A discrete ordered ring or discretely ordered ring is an ordered ring in which there is no element between 0 and 1. The integers are a discrete ordered ring, but the rational numbers are not.

== Basic properties ==
For all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; in &quot;R&quot;:
*If &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; and 0 ≤ &quot;c&quot;, then &quot;ac&quot; ≤ &quot;bc&quot;. This property is sometimes used to define ordered rings instead of the second property in the definition above.
*|&quot;ab&quot;| = |&quot;a&quot;||&quot;b&quot;|.
*An ordered ring that is not trivial is infinite.
*Exactly one of the following is true: &quot;a&quot; is positive, −&quot;a&quot; is positive, or &quot;a&quot; = 0. This property follows from the fact that ordered rings are abelian, linearly ordered groups with respect to addition. 
*In an ordered ring, no negative element is a square: Firstly, 0 is square. Now if &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0 and &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;2 then &quot;b&quot; ≠ 0 and &quot;a&quot; = (−&quot;b&quot;)2; as either &quot;b&quot; or −&quot;b&quot; is positive, &quot;a&quot; must be nonnegative.

<doc id="525703" wikidata="Q3384148" url="?curid=525703" title="Pierre Bourgault">
<text>Pierre Bourgault (January 23, 1934 – June 16, 2003) was a politician and essayist, as well as an actor and journalist, from Quebec, Canada. He is most famous as a public speaker who advocated sovereignty for Quebec from Canada.

== Biography ==
Bourgault was born in East Angus in the Estrie (Eastern Townships) region of Quebec. His father was a civil servant and his mother, a homemaker. His parents sent him to boarding school at age seven, determined that he should receive the education which they lacked. After secondary school, he briefly attended the seminary and entertained the idea of a possible entry into the priesthood, per ancestral tradition, but reneged on his obligation shortly thereafter. He is today entombed within the traditionally Catholic Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

Beginning in the early 1960s, he supported Quebec independence from Canada and in 1960 joined the pro-independence &quot;Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale&quot;. A famed and inflammatory orator, he led a number of union strikes and marches that resulted in violence. In 1964, he became leader of the RIN, and came up just short in the Duplessis riding of Northern Quebec. During the St. Jean Baptiste celebration in 1968, a demonstration for Quebec nationalism turned into a riot when other supporters threw projectiles at newly minted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. He and 300 others were arrested for this incident, while Trudeau&#x27;s stoic response significantly helped.

In 1964 he made a small appearance in Denis Héroux&#x27;s student film &quot;Over My Head (Jusqu&#x27;au cou)&quot;, as himself in a political debate.

In 1968, popular cabinet minister and television host René Lévesque founded &quot;Mouvement Souveraineté-Association&quot;, a more moderate sovereignist party. Lévesque rebuffed in an attempt to have the RIN included &quot;en masse&quot;, fearing the RIN&#x27;s reputation for protests and violence would hurt the movement. Bourgeault disbanded the party and invited its members to join the MSA one by one and the new &quot;Ralliement national&quot; in the newly founded &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;, under Lévesque&#x27;s leadership.

In the 1970 Quebec election, he was the Parti Québécois candidate in Mercier electoral district, running unsuccessfully against Liberal leader (and soon-to-be Premier) Robert Bourassa, who would become a close personal friend.
Bourgault himself did not play any role in the PQ government that came to power in the 1976 Quebec election and was given a patronage appointment. He often quarreled with Lévesque, especially in the lead up to the 1980 referendum because he disagreed with the strategy on sovereignty advocated by the premier of Quebec. Bourgault leaves the PQ during the 1980s.

In his early life, he was a journalist at Montreal newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot;, and he returned to this publication in the 1990s as a columnist for &quot;Le Journal de Montréal&quot; newspaper. After 1976, he was a professor of communications at the Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM). He was also the co-host or regular columnist of several radio shows aired on la Société Radio-Canada, the French language sector of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. 

In 1992, he had an acting role in the film &quot;Léolo&quot;, cast by director Jean-Claude Lauzon. to whom Bourgault was a mentor. Lauzon denied he was cast for political reasons.

He was openly gay, though he said in an interview for Radio-Canada a few years before his death that in his later years he chose to stop having sexual relations.

Bourgault was a fluent and eloquent speaker of English. For a brief period in the 1980s, he was a weekly columnist for Montreal&#x27;s anglophone daily, The Gazette.

<text>Wil Tirion (19 February 1943 – 5 July 2024) was a Dutch uranographer (celestial cartographer). His work, which included star charts and atlases, was widely distributed and renowned by astronomers.

Originally a graphic designer, Tirion became a full-time celestial cartographer after the success of his first star atlas, &quot;Sky Atlas 2000.0&quot;, published in 1981. His second major work, &quot;Uranometria 2000.0&quot;, contained over 280,000 stars and 10,000 deep-sky objects across two volumes and was published by Willmann-Bell in 1987. Tirion&#x27;s sky charts have also been published in astronomy magazines and books, as well as on astronomy websites.

Tirion&#x27;s early work was largely done by hand, with computer-generated plots as references. In the mid-1990s, he switched to digital illustration.

Tirion died on 5 July 2024 at the age of 81 after a brief illness. The asteroid 4648 Tirion is named for him.

<doc id="525722" wikidata="Q192746" url="?curid=525722" title="Colostrum">
<text>Colostrum (, of unknown origin) is the first form of milk produced by the mammary glands of humans and other mammals immediately following delivery of the newborn. Animal colostrum may be called beestings, the traditional word from Old English dialects. Most species will begin to generate colostrum just prior to giving birth. Colostrum contains antibodies to protect the newborn against disease and infection, and immune and growth factors and other bioactives that help to activate a newborn&#x27;s immune system, jumpstart gut function, and seed a healthy gut microbiome in the first few days of life. The bioactives found in colostrum are beneficial for a newborn&#x27;s health, growth and vitality. Colostrum strengthens a baby&#x27;s immune system and is filled with white blood cells to protect it from infection.

At birth, the environment of the newborn mammal shifts from the sterile conditions of the mother&#x27;s uterus, with a constant nutrient supply via the placenta, to the microbe-rich environment outside, with irregular oral intake of complex milk nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract. This transition puts high demands on the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate, as the gut plays an important part in both the digestive system and the immune system. Colostrum has evolved to care for highly sensitive mammalian neonates and contributes significantly to initial immunological defense as well as to the growth, development, and maturation of the neonate&#x27;s gastrointestinal tract by providing key nutrients and bioactive factors. Bovine colostrum powder is rich in protein and low in sugar and fat. Bovine colostrum can also be used for nonorganic failure to thrive in children and acute non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced increase in intestinal permeability in males and can boost a neonate&#x27;s immunity.

Colostrum also has a mild laxative effect, encouraging the passing of a baby&#x27;s first stool, which is called meconium. This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant&#x27;s body, and which is often responsible for jaundice.

Research on possible health benefits and medical applications of bovine colostrum is ongoing. As of January 2025, there is no accepted medical use of bovine colostrum to treat any condition.

== Bioactive components ==
Newborns have very immature and small digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its bioactives in a very concentrated low-volume form. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes) and many antibodies such as IgA, IgG, and IgM. These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system. Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, complement, and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP). A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well, tumor necrosis factor, and others.

Colostrum also contains a number of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1), and II, transforming growth factor alpha, beta 1 and beta 2, fibroblast growth factors, epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and colony-stimulating factor 1.

=== Proline-rich polypeptides ===
Proline-rich polypeptides (PRPs) are small immune signaling peptides that were independently discovered in colostrum and other sources, such as blood plasma, in the United States, Czechoslovakia and Poland. Hence they appear under various names in the literature, including Colostrinin, CLN, transfer factor and PRP. They function as signal transducing molecules that have the unique effect of modulating the immune system, turning it up when the body comes under attack from pathogens or other disease agents, and damping it when the danger is eliminated or neutralized. At first thought to actually transfer immunity from one immune system to another, it now appears that PRPs simply stimulate cell-mediated immunity.

== Human ==

Colostrum, which is produced for the first two to four days after childbirth, enhances immunity in infants and is hypothesized to have anti-inflammatory properties. It is suggested infants fed with human colostrum have lower incidence of gastrointestinal infections. In addition, colostrum also has a laxative effect, encouraging the baby&#x27;s body to excrete stool, which helps eliminate excess bilirubin. This helps prevent jaundice and allergies in babies.

== Bovine ==

Dairy cattle are naturally exposed to pathogens and produce immunoglobulins against them. These antibodies are present in the cow&#x27;s bloodstream and in the colostrum. These immunoglobulins are specific to many human pathogens, including &quot;Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium parvum, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella &quot;species&quot;, Staphylococcus&quot; species, and rotavirus (which causes diarrhea in infants). Before the development of antibiotics, colostrum was the main source of immunoglobulins used to fight bacteria. In fact, Albert Sabin, who developed the first oral vaccine against polio, used colostrum in an experiment to evaluate the protective effect of breastfeeding against the poliomyelitis virus. Sabin obtained blood serum and milk samples from 30 human nursing mothers at different times after delivery. He then mixed the serum and blood from each individual mother together, in systematically differing proportions, and added &quot;a constant amount&quot; of the Lansing strain of the poliomyelitis virus. The mixtures were then injected into the brains of mice. The results showed that 100% of the human colostrum samples had antipoliomyelitic activity whereas only &quot;80 per cent of the milk specimens obtained between 101 and 340 days after delivery&quot; had such activity. He also tested cow&#x27;s milk (not specified as colostrum) and found that milk samples from 2 of 9 cows contained antipoliomyelitic activity. When antibiotics began to appear, interest in colostrum waned, but, now that antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens have developed, interest is once again returning to natural alternatives to antibiotics, namely, colostrum.

=== Human consumption ===
Bovine (cow) colostrum and its components may support biological activities when given to more mature children and adults.

Bovine colostrum and human colostrum contain many of the same antibodies, immune and growth factors, and nutrients. Possible benefits of bovine colostrum for human health include:

* Immune health: Colostrum contains bioactive compounds that may support immune health, including immunoglobulins and oligosaccharides. These compounds may also support respiratory health in adults and children. One study of human subjects suggested that oral colostrum was effective in preventing influenza.
* Digestive health: Colostrum contains immunoglobulins, growth factors, and oligosaccharides. These compounds may help to maintain and support intestinal integrity and improve nutrient absorption, while its naturally occurring prebiotics feed beneficial gut bacteria in adults and children.
* Early life nutrition: Colostrum may have continued benefits in children over the age of one: to support children&#x27;s immune systems, soothe digestive upsets, and otherwise support digestive health. 
* Sports nutrition: Bovine colostrum may help support sports nutrition, to help maintain a healthy immune system during the stress during athletic training, while supporting cellular proliferation and restitution as well as protein synthesis and soft tissue repair.
There is also research suggesting that a large proportion of colostrum is not fit for human consumption &quot;due to tremendous bacterial loads&quot;. Salmonella was also detected in 15% of unpasteurised samples. Pasteurisation reduces the bioactive proteins many of the benefits rely upon, however.

=== Skin health ===
Bovine colostrum (BC) may promote skin health. A study conducted in 2021 by Jogi Reena et al. found that Bovine Colostrum may help delay skin aging by reducing telomere shortening, which is a marker of cellular aging. The researchers attributed these benefits to the antioxidant properties of BC, which help maintain telomere length and boost fibroblast proliferation—a key element in collagen production and the maintenance of skin structure. These results indicate that BC could contribute to healthier and more youthful skin over time.

Enhanced Healing and Regeneration: BC has been shown to stimulate fibroblast activity, aiding in the repair of damaged skin and the creation of new tissue, making it effective for wound healing and scar reduction.

Anti-Aging Properties: BC is rich in antioxidants that combat free radicals, which are significant contributors to skin aging. These antioxidants, combined with growth factors, improve skin elasticity and firmness, helping to diminish the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines. A clinical study published in the &quot;Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology&quot; found that topical application of antioxidants significantly improved skin texture and reduced signs of aging in participants over a 12-week period.

Wound Healing: The immunoglobulins and lactoferrin in topically applied BC work together to improve the Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment score of chronic non-healing ulcers on day 21 of treatment.

=== Use in animal husbandry ===
Colostrum is beneficial for newborn farm animals. They receive no passive transfer of immunity via the placenta before birth, so any antibodies that they need have to be either ingested or supplied by injection or other artificial means. The ingested antibodies are absorbed from the intestine of the neonate. Maximum absorption of colostral antibodies by the newborn animal occurs within 4 hours or thirty minutes of birth.
The role of colostrum for newborn animals is to provide nutrition, and protect against infection while the immune and digestive systems are developing and maturing. Bovine colostrum provides macro- and micro-nutrients, as well as growth factors, cytokines, nucleosides, oligosaccharides, natural antimicrobials, antioxidants; and a range of immunoglobulins such as IgG, IgA, IgD, IgM and IgE. Minimal levels of IgG are essential to prevent failure of passive transfer. The iron-binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also help regulate epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, and restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc.

Bovine Colostrum contains bioactive components that support immunity and gut health in animals, and fight bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Early, high-quality colostrum is beneficial for survival and healthy development. It repairs intestinal damage and improves nutrient absorption. In calves, colostrum helps develop their gut and prevents death. It reduces infections, antibiotic use, and diarrhea, leading to faster growth and higher profits for farmers.

=== Use in companion animals ===

Much like in humans and production animals, companion animal survival in the newborn stage of life is largely dependent upon colostrum. Companion animal immune systems require several weeks to several months in order to fully develop. Maternal antibodies provide benefit for a relatively short period of time so a gap exists with immune sufficiency where an animal is at risk of infection. Like humans, companion animal immune response changes with age where early life and later in life have similarities. That is, an immune bias whereby the animal has less of an ability to fend off infections and greater prevalence of allergy at both ends of the age spectrum. Stress also affects a companion animal&#x27;s immune system including changes in environment, diet, etc. Maintaining gut microbial balance is key to maintaining a healthy immune system as well as mucosal integrity, similar to humans. Bovine colostrum has been demonstrated to benefit companion animal immunity and digestive health.

Bovine colostrum plays a role in increasing Ig levels, increasing lymphocyte proliferation stimulating activity and increasing phagocytosis activity. These are supported by other components of colostrum which further enhance the activity of the immune response. The iron binding glycoproteins lactoferrin and transferrin in bovine colostrum assist in attacking pathogens by impacting their cell membrane and making them more susceptible to the immune systems attack by neutrophils. Cytokines present in bovine colostrum enhance B and T cell maturation and increase endogenous antibody production. They also play a major role in regulation of epithelial cell growth and development, proliferation, restitution. Transfer factors enhance the activity of T cells. Other growth and immune factors such as IGF-1, IGF-2, FGF, EGF, TGF, PDGF, etc. Colostrum contains glycomacropeptides which help to regulate appetite. Studies suggest that bovine colostrum may enhance animal immunity, improve gut health, and lower the risk of illness.

=== Hyperimmune ===
Hyperimmune colostrum is natural bovine colostrum collected from a population of cows immunized repeatedly with a specific pathogen. The colostrum is collected within 24 hours of the cow giving birth. Antibodies towards the specific pathogens or antigens that were used in the immunization are present in higher levels than in the population before treatment. Although some papers have been published stating that specific human pathogens were just as high as in hyperimmune colostrum, and natural colostrum nearly always had higher antibody titers than did the hyperimmune version. A clinical trial showed that if the immunization is by surface antigens of a strain of E. coli bacteria, the Bovine Colostrum Powder can be used to make tablets capable of binding to the bacteria so that they are excreted in stools, thus preventing diarrhea that is caused by this strain of E. coli. This prevents the successful colonization of the gut, which would otherwise lead to bacteria releasing enterotoxigenic materials which cause diarrhea.

=== Potential applications ===

Although bovine colostrum has been consumed by humans for centuries, only in recent decades have we seen an increase in randomized clinical trials to support assertions of health benefits. It is probable that little absorption of intact growth factors and antibodies into the bloodstream occurs, due to digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. However, the presence of casein and other buffering proteins does allow growth factors and other bioactive molecules to pass into the lumen of the small intestine intact, where they can stimulate repair and inhibit microbes, working via local effects. This provides a probable mechanism explaining reductions in gut permeability after colostrum administration in some published studies, while another study found colostrum promising as treatment for distal colitis. Evidence for the beneficial effect of colostrum on extra-gastrointestinal problems is less well developed, due in part to the limited number of randomised double-blind studies published, although a variety of possible uses have been suggested.

The gut plays several important roles including acting as the main pathway for fluid, electrolyte and nutrient absorption while also acting as a barrier to toxic agents present in the gut lumen including acid, digestive enzymes and gut bacteria. It is also a major immunological defence mechanism, detecting natural commensals and triggering immune response when toxic microbes are present. Failure of homeostasis due to trauma, drugs and infectious microbes not only damages the gut but can lead to influx of damaging agents into the bloodstream. These mechanisms have relevance for multiple conditions affecting all areas of the world and socioeconomic groups such as ulcers, inflammation, and infectious diarrhea. There is currently much interest in the potential value of colostrum for the prevention and treatment of these conditions as it is derived from natural sources and can influence damaging factors through multiple pathways including nutritional support, immunological intervention (through its immunoglobulin and other anti-microbial factors) and growth/healing factor constituents., As pointed out by Kelly, inconsistency between results in some published studies may be due in part to variation in dose given and to the timing of the colostrum collection being tested (first milking versus pooled colostrum collected up to day 5 following calving).

Some athletes have used colostrum in an attempt to improve their performance, decrease recovery time, and prevent sickness during peak performance levels. Supplementation with bovine colostrum, 20 grams per day (g/d), in combination with exercise training for eight weeks may increase bone-free lean body mass in active men and women.

Low IGF-1 levels may be associated with dementia in the very elderly, although causation has not been established. Malnutrition can cause low levels of IGF-1, as can obesity. Supplementation with colostrum, which is rich in IGF-1, can be a useful part of a weight reduction program. Although IGF-1 is not absorbed intact by the body, some studies suggest it stimulates the production of IGF-1 when taken as a supplement whereas others do not.

Colostrum also has antioxidant components, such as lactoferrin and hemopexin, which binds free heme in the body.

The Isle of Man had a local delicacy called &quot;Groosniuys&quot;, a pudding made with colostrum.
In Finland, a baked cheese called Leipäjuusto is traditionally made with either cow colostrum or reindeer milk.

A sweet cheese-like delicacy called &#x27;Junnu&#x27; or &#x27;Ginna&#x27; is made with colostrum in the south Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is made with both cow and buffalo milk; in both cases milk produced on the second day after birth is considered ideal for preparing this pudding-like delicacy. Colostrum is in very high demand in these states, resulting in product adulteration.

<text>Don Cossacks (, ) or Donians (, ), are Cossacks who settled along the middle and lower Don. Historically, they lived within the former Don Cossack Host (, ), which was either an independent or an autonomous democratic republic in present-day Southern Russia and parts of the Donbas region of Ukraine, from the end of the 16th century until 1918. As of 1992, by presidential decree of the Russian Federation, Cossacks can be enrolled on a special register. A number of Cossack communities have been reconstituted to further Cossack cultural traditions, including those of the Don Cossack Host.
Don Cossacks have had a rich military tradition - they played an important part in the historical development of the Russian Empire and participated in most of its major wars.

== Etymology ==
The name Cossack (; ) was widely used to characterise &quot;free people&quot; (compare Turkic &quot;qazaq&quot;, which means &quot;free men&quot;) as opposed to others with different standing in feudal society (i.e., peasants, nobles, clergy, etc.). The name &quot;cossack&quot; was also applied to migrants, free-booters and bandits.

It has the same etymological root as &quot;Kazakh&quot;, an unrelated Central Asian Turkic people.
== Origins ==
The exact origins of Cossacks remain unclear. In the modern view, Don Cossacks descend from Slavic people connected with Russian lands like the Povolzhye, the Novgorod Republic, and the Principality of Ryazan, and Ukrainian lands like the Dnieper. As well as nomadic Turkic tribes inhabiting the Steppes. Gotho-Alans could also have played a role in forming Don Cossack culture, which originated in the western part of the North Caucasus.

=== Turkic theory ===
The theory of Russian historian A. M. Orlov is that Cossacks hosts were formed among Turkic nomads. He then thinks, that the Don Cossacks were originally formed largely by &quot;Meshchera Tatars&quot; under the Golden Horde, which he also connects to later Mishar Tatars. 

A. V. Mirtov wrote that the life and language of Don Cossacks were heavily influenced by &quot;Tatars from Meshchera&quot;. G. Shtekl on the other hand wrote that the first Russian Cossacks were simply &quot;Russified Tatars.&quot; V. N. Tatishchev: &quot;Some of them lived in the small cities of Meshchera, their capital being Donskoy, where the Donskoy Monastery is now.&quot; A. A. Gordeyev connects them to the Golden Horde also, and states: &quot;They did not fall under the Khans of the Orda, did not accept serfdom, were pained by all kinds of social injustice, and rebelled against feudal rule&quot;.

== History ==

===Early history===
More than two thousand years ago the Scythians lived on the banks of the river Don. Many Scythian tombs have been found in this area. Subsequently, the area was inhabited by the Khazars and the Polovtsians. From the 16th to the 18th centuries the steppes of the Don River were part of &quot;the Wild Field&quot; (). In the late Middle Ages the area was under the general control of the Golden Horde, and numerous Tatar (especially Crimean Tatar) armed groups roamed there, attacking and enslaving merchants and settlers.

The first Christians to settle on the territories around the Don were the Jassi and Kosogi tribes of the Khazar Kaghanate of the 7th to 10th centuries. After the fall of the Golden Horde in 1480, more colonists started to expand onto this land from the Novgorod Republic after the Battle of Shelon (1471), and from the neighboring Principality of Ryazan. Until the end of the 16th century, the Don Cossacks inhabited independent free territories.

===15th–17th centuries===
Cossacks of Ryazan are mentioned in 1444 as defenders of Pereslavl-Zalessky against the units of Golden Horde and in a letter of Ivan III of Russia from 1502. After the Golden Horde fell in 1480, the area around the Don River was divided between the Crimean west side and the Nogai east side. On their border since the 14th century the vast steppe of the Don region was populated by those people who were not satisfied with the existing social order, by those who did not recognize the power of the land-owners, by runaway serfs, by those who longed for freedom. In the course of time they turned into a united community and were called &quot;the Cossacks&quot;. At first the main occupation of these small armed detachments was hunting and fishing—as well as the constant struggle against the Turks and the Tatars who attacked them. Only later they began to settle and work on the land.

====16th century====
The first records relating to the Cossack villages: the &quot;stanitsas&quot;, date back to 1549. In the year 1552 Don Cossacks under the command of Ataman Susar Fedorov joined the Army of Ivan the Terrible during the Siege of Kazan in 1552. On 2 June 1556 the Cossack regiment of Ataman Lyapun Filimonov, together with the Army of Moscovits comprising strelets, conquered and annexed the Astrakhan Khanate.

During the reign of Ivan the Terrible (Ivan IV), the ataman Yermak Timofeyevich went on an expedition to conquer Siberia. After defeating Khan Kuchum in the fall of 1582 and occupying Isker, the capital of the Siberian Khanate, Yermak sent a force of Cossacks down the Irtysh in the winter of 1583. The detachment, led by Bogdan Bryazga (according to other sources, the Cossack chieftain Nikita Pan) passed through the lands of the Konda-Pelym Voguls and reached the walls of the town of Samarovo. Surprised by the Cossack attack, the Ostyaks surrendered. In fall 1585, shortly after Yermak&#x27;s death, Cossacks led by voevoda (army commander) Ivan Mansurov founded the first Russian fortified town in Siberia, Obskoy, at the mouth of the Irtysh river on the right bank of the Ob river. The Mansi and Khanty lands thus became part of the Russian state, finally secured by the founding of the cities of Pelym and Berezov in 1592 and Surgut in 1594. As a result of Yermak&#x27;s expedition, Russia was able to annex Siberia.

====17th century====
In the 17th century Cossacks waged war against the Ottomans and the Crimean Khanate. In 1637 the Don Cossacks, joined by the Zaporozhian Cossacks, captured the strategic Ottoman fortress of Azov, which guarded the Don. The defense of the Azov Fortress in 1641 was one of the key actions in Don Cossack history. After total taking of the Free Territories of Don Cossacks under the Moscovy control, Don Cossack history became more intertwined with the history of the rest of Russia. In exchange for protection of the Southern borders of medieval Russia, the Don Cossacks were given the privilege of not paying taxes and the tsar&#x27;s authority in Cossack lands was not as absolute as in other parts of Russia.

During this period, three of Russia&#x27;s most notorious rebels, Stenka Razin, Kondraty Bulavin and Emelian Pugachev, were Don Cossacks.

===18th–19th centuries===

After 1786, the territory of the Don Cossacks was officially called Don Host Land, and was renamed Don Host Oblast in 1870 (presently part of the Rostov, Volgograd, and Voronezh regions of the Russian Federation as well as part of the Luhansk region of Ukraine).

In 1805 the Don Cossack capital was shifted from Cherkassk to Novocherkassk (New Cherkassk).

Don Cossacks are credited with playing a significant part in repelling Napoleon&#x27;s Invasion of Russia. Under the command of Count Matvey Ivanovich Platov, the Don Cossacks fought in a number of battles against the Grande Armée. In the Battle of Borodino, Don Cossacks made raids to the rear of the French Army. Platov commanded all the Cossack troops and successfully covered the retreat of the Russian Army to Moscow. The Don Cossacks distinguished themselves in subsequent campaigns, and took part in the capture of Paris. Napoleon is credited with declaring, &quot;Cossacks are the finest light troops among all that exist. If I had them in my army, I would go through all the world with them.&quot;

In the general census of 1884, the male population of the Don Cossacks was reported to number 425,000. The Don Cossacks were the largest of the ten cossack hosts then in existence, providing over a third of total cossack manpower available for military service.

===20th century===

====World War I====
On the eve of World War I, the Don Cossack Host comprised 17 regular regiments plus 6 detached sotnias (squadrons). In addition two regiments of the Imperial Guard were recruited from the Don territory. By 1916 the Don Host had expanded to 58 line regiments and 100 detached sotnias. The central location of the Don territories meant that these units were employed extensively on both the German and Austro-Hungarian fronts, though less so against the Ottoman Turks to the south. The continued value of the Don and other Cossacks as mounted troops was illustrated by the decision taken in 1916 to dismount about a third of the regular Russian cavalry, but to retain the cossack regiments in their traditional role.

====February 1917 Revolution====
At the outbreak of the February 1917 Revolution, three regiments of Don Cossacks (the 1st, 4th and 14th) formed part of the garrison of St. Petersburg. Consisting partly of new recruits from the poorer regions of the Host territory, these units were influenced by the general disillusionment with the Tsar&#x27;s government. Accordingly, they did not act effectively when ordered to disperse the growing demonstrations in the city. Reports that the historically loyal Don Cossacks could no longer be relied on were a significant factor in the sudden collapse of the Tsarist regime.

====Bolshevik persecution====
The Don Cossack Host was disbanded on Russian soil in 1918, after the Russian Revolution, but the Don Cossacks in the White Army and those who emigrated abroad, continued to preserve the traditions, musical and otherwise, of their host. Many found employment as trick riders in various circuses throughout Europe and the United States. Admiral Aleksandr Vasiliyevich Kolchak, one of the leaders of the White movement during the Russian Civil War, was of Don Cossack descent.
Following the defeat of the White Army in the Russian Civil War, a policy of decossackization (&quot;Raskazachivaniye&quot;) took place on the surviving Cossacks and their homelands, since they were viewed as a threat to the new Soviet regime.
The Cossack homelands were often very fertile, and during the collectivisation campaign many Cossacks shared the fate of the kulaks. According to historian Michael Kort, &quot;During 1919 and 1920, out of a population of approximately 1.5 million Don Cossacks, the Bolshevik regime killed or deported an estimated 300,000 to 500,000&quot;. Others, such as Peter Holquist, estimate a figure of 10,000 deaths during this period, while a far greater number would die during the engineered Soviet famines of 1932–33 and the Holodomor.
====Don Cossacks in World War II====
On 20 April 1936 the earlier ban on Cossacks serving in the Red Army was lifted. Later the same year two existing Red Army cavalry divisions were re-designated as Don Cossacks. By 1939 a number of these regiments had been issued with traditional Cossack uniforms, in ceremonial and field service versions. The dress of the Don Cossack units included dark-blue breeches with broad red stripes which had distinguished them prior to the Revolution. The Don Cossack Cavalry Corps saw extensive active service until 1943, after which its role diminished, as did that of the other remaining horse-mounted units in the Red Army. However Don Cossack cavalry was still in existence in 1945 and participated in the Victory Parade in Moscow.

During World War II, the Don Cossacks mustered the largest single concentration of Cossacks within the German Army, the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps, a great part of them former Soviet citizens. The XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps included the 1st Cossack Division and the 2nd Cossack Division.

The majority of the Cossacks remained loyal to the Red Army. In the earliest battles, particularly the encirclement of Belostok Cossack units such as the 94th Beloglisnky, 152nd Rostovsky and 48th Belorechensky regiments fought to their death.

In the opening phase of the war, during the German advance towards Moscow, Cossacks were extensively used for raids behind enemy lines. The most famous of these took place during the Battle of Smolensk under the command of Lev Dovator, whose 3rd Cavalry Corps consisted of the 50th and 53rd Cavalry divisions from the Kuban and Terek Cossacks mobilised from the Northern Caucasus. The raid in ten days covered 300 km and destroyed the hinterlands of the 9th German Army before successfully breaking out. Whilst units under the command of General Pavel Belov, the 2nd Cavalry Corps of Don, Kuban and Stavropol Cossacks spearheaded the counter-attack onto the right flank of the 6th German Army, delaying its advance towards Moscow.

The high professionalism that the Cossacks under Dovator and Belov (both generals would later be granted the title Hero of the Soviet Union and their units raised to a Guards (elite) status) ensured that many new units would be formed. The Germans during the whole war only managed to form two Cossack Corps, while the Red Army in 1942 alone had 17. Many of the newly formed units were filled with ethnically Cossack volunteers. The Kuban Cossacks were allocated to the 10th, 12th and 13th Corps. However, the most famous Kuban Cossack unit was the 17th Cossack Corps under the command of general Nikolay Kirichenko.

During one particular attack, Cossacks killed up to 1,800 enemy soldiers and officers, took 300 prisoners, and seized 18 artillery pieces and 25 mortars. The 5th and 9th Romanian Cavalry divisions fled in panic, and the 198th German Infantry division hastily departed with large losses to the left bank of the river Ei.

During the opening phase of the Battle of Stalingrad, when the Germans overran the Kuban, the majority of the Cossack population, long before the Germans began their agitation with Krasnov and Shkuro, became involved in Partisan activity. Raids on the German positions from the Caucasus mountains became commonplace. After the German defeat at Stalingrad, the 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Corps, strengthened by tanks and artillery, broke through the German lines and liberated Mineralnye Vody, and Stavropol.

===21st century===

====Modern Don Cossacks====

The Don Cossacks were revived in the early 1990s and were officially recognised by the Russian Government in 1997, its Ataman holding the rank, insignia and uniform of a full Marshal.

In 1992 they joined the separatist forces during the Transnistria War.

Don Cossacks volunteered by hundreds to fight in South Ossetia during the 2008 Russo-Georgian war.

In 2009, the Ukrainian Security Service banned a leader of the Don Cossacks from entering Ukraine in order to prevent the creation of an illegal parliamentary formation on Ukrainian territory.

Since 2014, members of Don Cossacks have participated in the war in Eastern Ukraine as independent volunteers for the pro-Russian Donbass militias.
Reportedly several military formations were formed though most of these groups were subsequently disbanded and integrated into the armed forces of the DPR and LPR.

==National symbols of Don Cossacks==

===Flag of Don Cossacks===
The Don Cossacks flag 3:4 was inaugurated during the Don Cossacks assembly in Novocherkassk, Don Republic, on 4 May 1918 under chiefing of Ataman Pyotr Krasnov. The flag has three colours: blue, yellow, and red. The flag is similar to that of the Ukrainian State, also established in 1918, which the Don Republic bordered to its west.

===Coat of arms===
The Don Cossacks Coat of Arms was known from the 17th century. It was adopted as a symbol of the Don Republic on 15 September 1918.
===Uniform===
Until 1914 the distinguishing colour of the Don Cossack Host was red: worn on the cap bands and wide trouser stripes of a dark blue uniform of the loose-fitting cut common to the Steppe Cossacks. Tall lambskin hats were worn on occasion, with red cloth tops edged in white lace. Silver metal scrolls were worn on the headdress to denote the distinguished conduct of individual regiments. Officers had silver braiding on their collars and epaulettes plus silver/black girdles. Shoulder-straps of other ranks were the same dark blue as the caftan (coat). A whip was used instead of spurs. Prior to 1908, individual cossacks from all Hosts were required to provide their own uniforms (together with horses and harness). However the size and relative affluence of the Don Cossack Host permitted the setting up of communally owned clothing factories.

A khaki field tunic was adopted in 1908, replacing the dark blue coats or white (summer) blouses previously worn for ordinary duties. However the blue riding breeches with broad red stripes long characteristic of the Don Host, continued to be worn even on active service during both World Wars.

The Don Cossack Battery of the Imperial Guard wore a &quot;Tsar&#x27;s green&quot; (a dark shade common to the army) uniform, with the black and red distinctions of the artillery as a branch.

===Anthem of Don Cossacks===
&quot;Всколыхнулся, взволновался православный Тихий Дон&quot; written by Fedor Anisimov in 1853. 

==Religion==
Most Don Cossacks are Russian Orthodox, who consider themselves guardians of the faith. However, a large percentage of Don Cossacks were Starovers. Even in 1903, a minimum of 150,000 from a total of the 2,500,000 parish members of the Don Eparchy were Starovers. Ataman count Matvei Platov was of a Popovtsy Old Believers Family. Don Cossacks were tolerant of other religions – with the exception of Jews – and accepted Buddhists, Muslims, Old Believers, and pagans into their communities.

== Traditions and culture ==
The Cossacks had a democratic society where the most important decisions were made during a Common Assembly (Казачий Круг). The assembly elected temporary authorities — atamans.

Don Cossacks were skilled horsemen and experienced warriors, due to their long conflict with the Crimean Khanate and the Ottoman Empire. They sold their military services to different powers in Eastern Europe. Together with the Polish King, they raided Moscow during the Time of Troubles (Смутное Время) and, under Russian authority, carried out raids and expeditions against Ottoman Turkey and Qajar Persia.

Isolated between Russian and Muslim territory, the Don Cossacks developed a distinct culture and language which fused Ukrainian, Russian, Kalmyk, and Tatar elements.

The Don Cossacks have a tradition of choral singing and many of their songs, such as &quot;Chyorny Voron&quot; (Black Raven) and &quot;Lyubo, Bratsi, Lyubo&quot; (It&#x27;s good, brothers, good) became popular throughout the rest of Russia. Many of the songs are about death in war.

Up to the 18th century marriages and divorces were held in the Common Assembly (Казачий Круг). If a Cossack wanted to marry a woman he was expected to bring her to the Common Assembly for presentation. If the Common Assembly gave approval, the marriage followed. The same procedure took place if there was a divorce. Peter I banned these practices in the Common Assembly, requiring Cossacks to marry only in church.

A Cossack marriage is a complex ritual, accompanied by songs, dances and performances. A bridegroom arrives on horseback and takes his bride to the church, followed by a marriage train. After the wedding all present would adjourn to the bridegroom&#x27;s house. There, the parents would bless the couple, break a loaf of bread above their heads, and sprinkle them with wheat, nuts, sweets and hops. The bride&#x27;s hair would then be unbraided according to traditional rites.

When a son was born to a Cossack family, his parents presented him with an arrow, a bow, a cartridge, a bullet and a gun. All of these items were hung on the wall, over the boy&#x27;s bed. At the age of three, the boy began to ride a horse. At the age of 7 to 8 he was allowed to ride in the street, to go fishing and hunt with adults.

Horse racing was a popular pastime with Don Cossacks. Riders competed to hit a target, firing weapons from horseback. The most dexterous were able to do this standing on the horses back. It was traditional practice for Cossack families to provide a young Cossack with two horses, a uniform and weapons.

Cossack leave-taking was always festive. All departing Cossacks would gather in the church, then hang a small bag around their necks containing a pinch of their native soil before setting off singing. Having left their stanitsa, they drank a cup of vodka and said good-bye to their native land.

===Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff===

The Don Cossack Choir Serge Jaroff was a group of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army who were discovered singing in Çilingir (near Constantinople), where they had fled after the defeat of their army in the Crimea. They made their formal concert debut in Vienna in 1923, led by their founder, conductor and composer, Serge Jaroff.

The choir became popular in America, Japan and Europe, touring the world in the 1930s, 40s and 50s, till today. The men, dressed as Cossacks, sang a cappella in a repertory of Russian sacred and secular music, army, folk and art songs. Cossack dancing was eventually added to their programme.

===In popular culture===
Mikhail Sholokhov&#x27;s monumental work, &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot;, deals sympathetically with the Don Cossacks and depicts the destruction of their way of life as a result of World War I and the Russian Civil War.

<text>Central European Time (CET) is a standard time of Central, and parts of Western Europe, which is one hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
The time offset from UTC can be written as UTC+01:00.
It is used in most parts of Europe and in a few North African countries.
CET is also known as Middle European Time (MET, German: MEZ) and by colloquial names such as Amsterdam Time, Berlin Time, Brussels Time, Budapest Time, Madrid Time, Paris Time, Stockholm Time, Rome Time, Prague time, Warsaw Time or Romance Standard Time (RST).

The 15th meridian east is the central axis per UTC+01:00 in the world system of time zones.

As of 2023, all member states of the European Union observe summer time (daylight saving time), from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.
States within the CET area switch to Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+02:00) for the summer.
The next change to CET is scheduled for midnight of 25October 2025. 

In Africa, UTC+01:00 is called West Africa Time (WAT), where it is used by several countries, year round.
Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia also refer to it as &quot;Central European Time&quot;.

* 1940
** Under German occupation:
*** The Netherlands was switched from UTC+00:20 to CET.
*** Belgium was switched from UTC+00:00.
*** Luxembourg was switched from UTC+00:00.
*** France, which had adopted Paris time on 14 March 1891 and Greenwich Mean Time on 9 March 1911, was switched to CET.
** Spain switched to CET.
After World War II Monaco, Andorra and Gibraltar implemented CET.

Portugal used CET in the years 1966–1976 and 1992–1996.

;United Kingdom
The time around the world is based on Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) which is roughly synonymous with Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). From late March to late October, clocks in the United Kingdom are put forward by one hour for British Summer Time (BST). Since 1997, most of the European Union aligned with the British standards for BST.

In 1968 there was a three-year experiment called &quot;British Standard Time&quot;, when the UK and Ireland experimentally employed British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year round; clocks were put forward in March 1968 and not put back until October 1971.

Central European Time is sometimes referred to as continental time in the UK.

=== Other countries ===
Several African countries use UTC+01:00 all year long, where it is known as West Africa Time (WAT), although Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia use the term &quot;Central European Time&quot; despite being in North Africa.

Between 2005 and 2008, Tunisia observed daylight saving time. Libya also used CET during the years 1951–1959, 1982–1989, 1996–1997 and 2012–2013.

For other countries see UTC+01:00 and West Africa Time.

== Discrepancies between official CET and geographical CET ==


The criteria for drawing time zones is based on many factors including: legal, political, economic, and physical or geographic. Consequently, time zones rarely adhere to meridian lines. The CET time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;nominal&quot; UTC+01:00 time, actually use another time zone (UTC+02:00 in particular – there are no &quot;physical&quot; UTC+01:00 areas that employ UTC+00:00). Conversely, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+01:00, even though their &quot;physical&quot; time zone is UTC (typically), UTC−01:00 (westernmost Spain), or UTC+02:00 (e.g. the very easternmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Poland and Serbia). On the other hand, people in Spain still have all work and meal hours one hour later than France and Germany despite sharing the same time zone. Historically Gibraltar maintained UTC+01:00 all year until the opening of the land border with Spain in 1982, when it followed its neighbour and introduced CEST. The following is a list of such &quot;incongruences&quot;:

=== Areas within UTC+01:00 longitudes using other time zones ===
These areas are between 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+1)

==== Areas using UTC+02:00 ====
* The westernmost part of Greece, including the cities of Patras, Ioannina and the island of Corfu
* The westernmost parts of the Bulgarian provinces of Vidin and Kyustendil
* The westernmost part of Romania, including most of the area of the counties of Caraș-Severin, Timiș (capital Timișoara), Arad, and Bihor, as well as the westernmost tips of the counties of Mehedinți and Satu Mare
* The westernmost tip of Ukraine, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia, at the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), essentially comprising the city of Uzhhorod and its environs. (Although CET is used as local, non-official time in Transcarpathia).
* Western Lithuania, including the cities of Klaipėda, Tauragė, and Telšiai
* Western Latvia, including the cities of Liepāja and Ventspils
* The westernmost parts of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, including the capital of the Saare County, Kuressaare
* The southwestern coast of Finland, including the city of Turku; also the Åland islands (of Finnish jurisdiction) – the Åland islands are the westernmost locale applying EET in the whole of Europe
* The northwesternmost part of Finland, including Kilpisjärvi and Kaaresuvanto.
* The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad Oblast, excluding however its easternmost slice (the city of Nesterov is east of 22°30′ E, but that of Krasnoznamensk is not)

=== Areas outside UTC+01:00 longitudes using UTC+01:00 time ===
These areas are either west of 7°30′ E or east of 22°30′ E (outside nominal UTC+01:00)

==== Areas between 22°30′ W and 7°30′ W (nominal UTC−01:00) ====
* The westernmost part of mainland Spain (Galicia, e.g. the city of A Coruña); Cape Finisterre and nearby points in Galicia, at 9°18′ W, are the westernmost places of CET in Spain.
* The Norwegian island of Jan Mayen lies entirely within this area and extends nearly as far west as Cape Finisterre, with its western tip at 9°5′ W and its eastern tip at 7°56′ W.
*Western Morocco including the city of Casablanca, at 7°35′ W. CET usage in Morocco extends as west as 13°10′ W.
*The entirety of Western Sahara with its western tip at 17°6′ W and its eastern tip at 8°40′ W.

==== Areas between 7°30′ W and 7°30′ E (nominal UTC+00:00) ====
* Andorra
* Belgium
* France, with the small exception of two separate easternmost parts of the mainland, one along eastern Alsace, incl. Strasbourg and the other in parts of the Alpes-Maritimes department, as well as the island of Corsica. Overseas departments of France use local times.
* The very westernmost part of Germany, incl. the cities of Saarbrücken, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aachen, and Trier
* The absolutely westernmost part of Italy, incl. the cities of Aosta in Aosta Valley and Cuneo in Piedmont
* Luxembourg
* Monaco
* Netherlands
* The westernmost part of Norway, incl. the cities of Bergen and Stavanger
* Spain, except for the westernmost part of the mainland (see above) and the Canary Islands (which are further than 7°30′ W and use UTC+00:00).
* Gibraltar
* The part of Switzerland west of Bern (inclusive), also incl. cities such as Basel, Geneva, Lausanne, and Fribourg
*Most of Algeria including its capital Algiers.

==== Areas between 22°30′ E and 37°30′ E (nominal UTC+02:00) ====
* The easternmost part of North Macedonia, including the city of Strumica
* The easternmost part of Serbia, in the Pirot District, including the city of Pirot, and small easternmost parts of Bor District.
* The easternmost tips of Hungary and Slovakia, bordering to the north and south respectively the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), a bit to the east of Vásárosnamény, Hungary – Uzhhorod, Ukraine (both at 22°18′ E) line
* The easternmost part of Poland, including the cities of Lublin and Białystok
* The northeast of Sweden, in the Norrbotten province, including the cities of Kalix and Haparanda
* The northeast of Norway, lying north of Finland, roughly coinciding with the county of Finnmark. The easternmost town in Norway, Vardø, lies at 30°51′ E, which is so far east, so as to be east even of the central meridian of EET (UTC+02:00), i.e. east of Istanbul and Alexandria. The sun reaches its highest point at 10:56 (when not DST), although the sun does not vary so much in height at the latitude 70°N. &lt;br&gt;The Norwegian–Russian and the Polish-Belarusian border are the only places where CET (UTC+1/+2) borders Moscow time (UTC+03:00), resulting in a two hours time change (or one hour in summer) for the travellers crossing that border.
* There is a &quot;tri-zone&quot; point (where UTC+01:00, UTC+02:00, and UTC+03:00 meet, winter times) at the Norway–Finland–Russia tripoint near Muotkavaara. During the summer Finland and Russia both have UTC+03:00.
