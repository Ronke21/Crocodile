<text>The proximal tubule is the segment of the nephron in kidneys which begins from the renal pole of the Bowman&#x27;s capsule to the beginning of loop of Henle. At this location, the glomerular parietal epithelial cells (PECs) lining bowman’s capsule abruptly transition to proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). The proximal tubule can be further classified into the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and the proximal straight tubule (PST).

== Structure ==
The most distinctive characteristic of the proximal tubule is its luminal brush border.

===Brush border cell=== 
The luminal surface of the epithelial cells of this segment of the nephron is covered with densely packed microvilli forming a border readily visible under the light microscope giving the brush border cell its name. The microvilli greatly increase the luminal surface area of the cells, presumably facilitating their reabsorptive function as well as putative flow sensing within the lumen. The microvilli are composed of actin filament bundles that have been visualized using confocal microscopy.

The cytoplasm of the cells is densely packed with mitochondria, which are largely found in the basal region within the infoldings of the basal plasma membrane. The high quantity of mitochondria gives the cells an acidophilic appearance. The mitochondria are needed in order to supply the energy for the active transport of sodium ions out of the cells to create a concentration gradient which allows more sodium ions to enter the cell from the luminal side. Water passively follows the sodium out of the cell along its concentration gradient.

Cuboidal epithelial cells lining the proximal tubule have extensive lateral interdigitations between neighboring cells, which lend an appearance of having no discrete cell margins when viewed with a light microscope.

Agonal resorption of the proximal tubular contents after interruption of circulation in the capillaries surrounding the tubule often leads to disturbance of the cellular morphology of the proximal tubule cells, including the ejection of cell nuclei into the tubule lumen.

This has led some observers to describe the lumen of proximal tubules as occluded or &quot;dirty-looking&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;clean&quot; appearance of distal tubules, which have quite different properties.

===Divisions===
Based on its appearance at low magnification, the proximal tubule can be divided into two sections: the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), and the proximal straight tubule (PST). Differences in cell outlines exist between these segments, and therefore presumably in function too.

Based on ultrastructure, it can be divided into three segments, &quot;S1, S2, and S3.&quot;


====Proximal convoluted tubule (&quot;pars convoluta&quot;)====
The &quot;pars convoluta&quot; (Latin &quot;convoluted part&quot;) is the initial convoluted portion.

In relation to the morphology of the kidney as a whole, the convoluted segments of the proximal tubules are confined entirely to the renal cortex.

Some investigators on the basis of particular functional differences have divided the convoluted part into two segments designated S1 and S2.

====Proximal straight tubule (&quot;pars recta&quot;)====
The &quot;pars recta&quot; (Latin &quot;straight part&quot;) is the following straight (descending) portion.

Straight segments descend into the outer medulla. They terminate at a remarkably uniform level and it is their line of termination that establishes the boundary between the inner and outer stripes of the outer zone of the renal medulla.

As a logical extension of the nomenclature described above, this segment is sometimes designated as S3.

==Functions==
===Absorption===
The proximal tubule efficiently regulates the pH of the filtrate by secreting hydrogen ions (acid) into the tubule and reabsorbing approximately 80% of the filtered bicarbonate.

Fluid in the filtrate entering the proximal convoluted tubule is reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries. This is driven by sodium transport from the lumen into the blood by the Na+/K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells.

Sodium reabsorption is primarily driven by this P-type ATPase – 60–70% of the filtered sodium load is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule through active transport, solvent drag, and paracellular electrodiffusion. Active transport is mainly through the sodium/hydrogen antiporter NHE3. Paracellular transport increases transport efficiency, as determined by oxygen consumed per unit of Na+ reabsorbed, thus playing a part in maintaining renal oxygen homeostasis.

===Secretion===
Many types of medications are secreted in the proximal tubule. &quot;Further reading: Drugs secreted in the kidney&quot;

Most of the ammonium that is excreted in the urine is formed in the proximal tubule via the breakdown of glutamine to alpha-ketoglutarate. This takes place in two steps, each of which generates an ammonium anion: the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate. The alpha-ketoglutarate generated in this process is then further broken down to form two bicarbonate anions, which are pumped out of the basolateral portion of the tubule cell by co-transport with sodium ions.

==Clinical significance==

Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) have a pivotal role in kidney disease. Two mammalian cell lines are commonly used as models of the proximal tubule: porcine LLC-PK1 cells and marsupial OK cells.

===Cancer===
Most renal cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer, arises from the convoluted tubules.

===Other===
Acute tubular necrosis occurs when PTECs are directly damaged by toxins such as antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin), pigments (e.g., myoglobin) and sepsis (e.g., mediated by lipopolysaccharide from gram-negative bacteria). Renal tubular acidosis (proximal type) (Fanconi syndrome) occurs when the PTECs are unable to properly reabsorb glomerular filtrate so that there is increased loss of bicarbonate, glucose, amino acids, and phosphate.

PTECs also participate in the progression of tubulointerstitial injury due to glomerulonephritis, ischemia, interstitial nephritis, vascular injury, and diabetic nephropathy. In these situations, PTECs may be directly affected by protein (e.g., proteinuria in glomerulonephritis), glucose (in diabetes mellitus), or cytokines (e.g., interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factors). There are several ways in which PTECs may respond: producing cytokines, chemokines, and collagen; undergoing epithelial mesenchymal trans-differentiation; necrosis or apoptosis.

<doc id="529373" wikidata="Q92776" url="?curid=529373" title="Steve Furber">
<text>Stephen Byram Furber (born 21 March 1953) is a British computer scientist, mathematician and hardware engineer, and Emeritus ICL Professor of Computer Engineering in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester, UK. After completing his education at the University of Cambridge (BA, MMath, PhD), he spent the 1980s at Acorn Computers, where he was a principal designer of the BBC Micro and the ARM 32-bit RISC microprocessor. , over 250 billion ARM chips have been manufactured, powering much of the world&#x27;s mobile computing and embedded systems, everything from sensors to smartphones to servers.

In 1990, he moved to Manchester to lead research into asynchronous circuits, low-power electronics and neural engineering, where the Spiking Neural Network Architecture (SpiNNaker) project is delivering a computer incorporating a million ARM processors optimised for computational neuroscience.

==Education==
Furber was educated at Manchester Grammar School and represented the UK in the International Mathematical Olympiad in Hungary in 1970 winning a bronze medal. He went on to study the Mathematical Tripos as an undergraduate student of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Master of Mathematics (MMath – Part III of the Mathematical Tripos) degrees. In 1978, he was appointed a Rolls-Royce research fellow in aerodynamics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge and was awarded a PhD in 1980 for research on the fluid dynamics of the Weis-Fogh mechanism supervised by John Ffowcs Williams. During his PhD in the late 1970s, Furber worked on a voluntary basis for Hermann Hauser and Chris Curry within the fledging Acorn Computers (originally the Cambridge Processor Unit), on a number of projects; notably a microprocessor based fruit machine controller, and the &quot;Proton&quot; – the initial prototype version of what was to become the BBC Micro, in support of Acorn&#x27;s tender for the BBC Computer Literacy Project.

==Career and research==
In 1981, following the completion of his PhD and the award of the BBC contract to Acorn computers, Furber joined Acorn where he was a Hardware Designer and then Design Manager. He was involved in the final design and production of the BBC Micro and later, the Acorn Electron, and the ARM microprocessor. In August 1990 he moved to the University of Manchester to become the International Computers Limited (ICL) Professor of Computer Engineering and established the AMULET microprocessor research group.

Furber&#x27;s main research interests are in neural networks, networks on chip and microprocessors. In 2003, Furber was a member of the EPSRC research cluster in biologically inspired novel computation. On 16 September 2004, he gave a speech on &quot;Hardware Implementations of Large-scale Neural Networks&quot; as part of the initiation activities of the Alan Turing Institute.

Furber&#x27;s most recent project SpiNNaker, is an attempt to build a new kind of computer that directly mimics the workings of the human brain. Spinnaker is an artificial neural network realised in hardware, a massively parallel processing system eventually designed to incorporate a million ARM processors. The finished Spinnaker will model 1 per cent of the human brain&#x27;s capability, or around 1 billion neurons. The Spinnaker project aims amongst other things to investigate:

* How can massively parallel computing resources accelerate our understanding of brain function?
* How can our growing understanding of brain function point the way to more efficient parallel, fault-tolerant computation?

Furber believes that &quot;significant progress in &quot;either&quot; direction will represent a major scientific breakthrough&quot;. Furber&#x27;s research interests include asynchronous systems, ultra-low-power processors for sensor networks, on-chip interconnect and globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS), and neural systems engineering.

His research has been funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), Royal Society and the European Research Council (ERC).

===Awards and honours===
In February 1997, Furber was elected a Fellow of the British Computer Society. In 1998, he became a member of the European Working Group on Asynchronous Circuit Design (ACiD-WG). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2002 and was Specialist Adviser to the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee inquiry into microprocessor technology.

Furber was elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2005 and a Fellow of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (FIET). He is a Chartered Engineer (CEng). In September 2007 he was awarded the Faraday Medal and in 2010 he gave the Pinkerton Lecture.

Furber was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2008 New Year Honours and was elected as one of the three laureates of Millennium Technology Prize in 2010 (with Richard Friend and Michael Grätzel), for development of ARM processor. In 2012, Furber was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his work, with Sophie Wilson, on the BBC Micro computer and the ARM processor architecture.&quot;

In 2004 he was awarded a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award. In 2014, he was made a Distinguished Fellow at the British Computer Society (DFBCS) recognising his contribution to the IT profession and industry. Furber&#x27;s nomination for the Royal Society reads: 

In 2009, Unsworth Academy (formerly called Castlebrook High School) in Manchester introduced a house system, with &quot;Furber&quot; being one of the four houses. On 15 October 2010, Furber officially opened the Independent Learning Zone in Unsworth Academy. In 2012, a building at Radbroke Hall was named in his honour by Barclays Bank.

In 2022, he was awarded the Charles Stark Draper Prize by the National Academy of Engineering of the United States of America alongside John L. Hennessy, David A. Patterson and Sophie M. Wilson for contributions to the invention, development, and implementation of reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chips. Furber was played by actor Sam Philips in the BBC Four documentary drama Micro Men, first aired on 8 October 2009.

==Personal life==

Furber is married to Valerie Elliot with two daughters, 3 grandchildren and plays bass guitar.

==History==
The school has its roots in the Computer Group of the Electrical Engineering Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. The Computer Group was established following Freddie Williams&#x27;s move to the Electrical Engineering Department in 1946. At its formation in 1964, the Department of Computer Science was the first such department in the United Kingdom, with Professor Tom Kilburn serving as Head of Department until 1980. On 1 May 2001, following the death of Kilburn the same year, the Computer Building was renamed Kilburn Building in his honour. The School of Computer Science was formed from the Department when the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to form the University of Manchester in 2004. It changed back from a school to a department in 2019. The Group/School/Department is notable for the following achievements:

* The world&#x27;s first electronic stored-program digital computer (the Manchester Baby)
* Virtual memory using paging (see Atlas Computer)
* Manchester encoding
* The AMULET microprocessor series ( implementations of the ARM computer architecture)

Having founded the group as a performance art project in 1984, he is the only member of KMFDM to appear on every release, and the only founding member still in the band. His main instruments are keyboards and drums, although he is also proficient at playing guitar and bass guitar.

==Side projects==
Konietzko has formed a number of side-projects:
*Excessive Force in 1990 with Buzz McCoy of My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult
*MDFMK in 1999 with Lucia Cifarelli and Tim Skold
*Schwein in 2000 with members of the Japanese band Buck-Tick and English musician Raymond Watts
*KGC in 2006 with Lucia Cifarelli and Dean Garcia of Curve
* OK•ZTEIN•OK in 2011, Konietzko&#x27;s first solo project

==Remixes==

He has re-mixed acts including Metallica, Megadeth, White Zombie, Rammstein, Love &amp; Rockets, Kittie, Die Krupps, Flotsam &amp; Jetsam, Living Colour, Mindless Self Indulgence, Combichrist, Young Gods, and Pig.

==Personal life==
Sascha Konietzko lived in the United States from 1991 to 2007, dividing his time among Chicago, New York City, and Seattle before moving back to his hometown of Hamburg, Germany. Konietzko married fellow KMFDM member Lucia Cifarelli in 2005.

<text>In axiomatic set theory, Shelah cardinals are a kind of large cardinals. A cardinal formula_1 is called Shelah iff for every formula_2, there exists a transitive class formula_3 and an elementary embedding formula_4 with critical point formula_1; and formula_6.

A Shelah cardinal has a normal ultrafilter containing the set of weakly hyper-Woodin cardinals below it.

<doc id="529394" wikidata="Q1833634" url="?curid=529394" title="Jack London Square">
<text>Jack London Square is a neighborhood on the waterfront of Oakland, California, United States. Named after the author Jack London and owned by the Port of Oakland, it is the home of stores, restaurants, hotels, Amtrak&#x27;s Jack London Square station, a San Francisco Bay Ferry ferry dock, the historic Heinold&#x27;s First and Last Chance Saloon, the (re-located) cabin where Jack London lived in the Klondike, and a movie theater. The former presidential yacht USS &quot;Potomac&quot; is moored at an adjacent slip.

==History==
The area developed as a warehouse and industrial district due to its proximity to major transportation, including the Southern Pacific Railroad (now Niles Subdivision) on Embarcadero West and the Western Pacific Railroad (now Oakland Subdivision) on Third Street, as well as the Oakland Estuary.

The area between Broadway, Webster, First Street (Embarcadero) and the estuary was named Jack London Square in 1951. On May 1, 1951, the area was formally dedicated and a plaque placed at the foot of Broadway.

==Geography==
Jack London Square is located at the south end of Broadway, across the Oakland Estuary from Alameda.

The name has also come to refer to the formerly industrial neighborhood surrounding Jack London Square now known as the Jack London District, which has undergone significant rehabilitation in the last decade, including loft conversions and new construction.

Former California Governor (and former Oakland mayor) Jerry Brown made his home here before moving north to the Uptown neighborhood.

==Tenants and businesses==
KTVU (Channel 2), the Bay Area&#x27;s Fox affiliate, has had studios at the Square since it began broadcasting on March 3, 1958, and the offices of the Port of Oakland are located there as well. The Square was also the temporary home of the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; from 1989 to 1996 after the newspaper was forced to abandon the landmark downtown Tribune Tower due to damage it sustained in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Other businesses at Jack London Square range from the Oakland Athletics team headquarters and software firm Navis LLC, to restaurants such as Farmhouse, Noka Ramen, Scott&#x27;s Seafood and Yoshi&#x27;s restaurant and jazz club. California Canoe &amp; Kayak retail and kayak rental shop has been located in Jack London Square since 1993.

==Railways and transit==
A mainline railroad runs through the middle of Embarcadero West, with the train speed limit set at 15 mph (25 km/h). Trains served 16th Street station until earthquake damage in 1989; afterwards, that station was replaced in 1994 by the present-day Jack London Square station. The tracks running through Jack London Square are used by BNSF and Union Pacific and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Capitol Corridor, Coast Starlight&quot; and &quot;San Joaquin&quot; services. The trains share the road with automobiles, AC Transit buses, and pedestrians. A second Transbay Tube may include a BART station at the square. Another possibility is an aerial tramway to BART stations in downtown Oakland.

==Design and development==
Jack London Square&#x27;s most recent changes are adding more businesses, restaurants, and entertainment. Under lead developer Ellis Partners, Jack London Square&#x27;s new architecture and public spaces are adding to the daytime and nighttime population and use. Recent new components include the 55 Harrison building, a mid-rise by RMW Architects in association with Steve Worthington. The public spaces by SWA Group extended the city to the waterfront by adding accessible waterfront spaces supporting a variety of programs and events from farmers markets to the popular festivals and events.

<text>The Peripatetic school ( ) was a philosophical school founded in 335 BC by Aristotle in the Lyceum in ancient Athens. It was an informal institution whose members conducted philosophical and scientific inquiries. After the middle of the 3rd century BC, the school fell into decline, and it was not until the Roman Empire that there was a revival.

==History==

The term &quot;peripatetic&quot; is a transliteration of the Ancient Greek word , meaning &#x27;of walking&#x27; or &#x27;given to walking about&#x27;. The Peripatetic school, founded by Aristotle, was actually known simply as the Peripatos. Aristotle&#x27;s school came to be so named because of the (&#x27;walkways&#x27;, some covered or with colonnades) of the Lyceum where the members met. The legend that the name came from Aristotle&#x27;s alleged habit of walking while lecturing may have started with Hermippus of Smyrna.

Unlike Plato (born  BC, died 348 BC), Aristotle was not a citizen of Athens, and could not own property; he and his colleagues therefore used the grounds of the Lyceum as a gathering place, just as it had been used by earlier philosophers such as Socrates. Aristotle and his colleagues first began to use the Lyceum in this way , after which Aristotle left Plato&#x27;s Academy and Athens, and then returned to Athens from his travels about a dozen years later. Because of the school&#x27;s association with the gymnasium, the school also came to be referred to simply as the &quot;Lyceum&quot;. Some modern scholars argue that the school did not become formally institutionalized until Theophrastus took it over, at which time there was private property associated with the school.

Originally at least, the Peripatetic gatherings were probably conducted less formally than the term &quot;school&quot; suggests: there was likely no set curriculum or requirements for students or even fees for membership. Aristotle did teach and lecture there, but there was also philosophical and scientific research done in partnership with other members of the school. It seems likely that many of the writings that have come down to us in Aristotle&#x27;s name were based on lectures he gave at the school. Among the members of the school in Aristotle&#x27;s time were Theophrastus, Phanias of Eresus, Eudemus of Rhodes, Aristoxenus, and Dicaearchus. Much like Plato&#x27;s Academy, there were in Aristotle&#x27;s school junior and senior members, the junior members generally serving as pupils or assistants to the senior members who directed research and lectured. The aim of the school, at least in Aristotle&#x27;s time, was not to further a specific doctrine, but rather to explore philosophical and scientific theories; those who ran the school worked as equal partners.

Some time shortly after the death of Alexander the Great in June 323 BC, Aristotle left Athens to avoid persecution by anti-Macedonian factions in Athens, due to his ties to Macedonia. After Aristotle&#x27;s death in 322 BC, his colleague Theophrastus succeeded him as head of the school. The most prominent member of the school after Theophrastus was Strato of Lampsacus, who increased the naturalistic elements of Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy and embraced a form of atheism. After the time of Strato, the Peripatetic school fell into a decline. Lyco was famous more for his oratory than his philosophical skills, and Aristo for his biographical studies. Although Critolaus was more philosophically active, none of the Peripatetic philosophers in this period seem to have contributed anything original to philosophy. The reasons for the decline of the Peripatetic school are unclear. Stoicism and Epicureanism provided many answers for those people looking for dogmatic and comprehensive philosophical systems, and the scepticism of the Middle Academy may have seemed preferable to anyone who rejected dogmatism. Later tradition linked the school&#x27;s decline to Neleus of Scepsis and his descendants hiding the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus in a cellar until their rediscovery in the 1st century BC, and even though this story may be doubted, it is possible that Aristotle&#x27;s works were not widely read.

The names of the first seven or eight scholarchs (leaders) of the Peripatetic school are known with varying levels of certainty. A list of names with the approximate dates they headed the school is as follows (all dates BC):

*Aristotle (c. 334 – 322)
*Theophrastus (322–288)
*Strato of Lampsacus (288 – c. 269)
*Lyco of Troas (c. 269 – 225)
*Aristo of Ceos (225 – c. 190)
*Critolaus (c. 190 – 155)
*Diodorus of Tyre (c. 140)
*Erymneus (c. 110)

There are some uncertainties in this list. It is not certain whether Aristo of Ceos was the head of the school, but since he was a close pupil of Lyco and the most important Peripatetic philosopher in the time when he lived, it is generally assumed that he was. It is not known if Critolaus directly succeeded Aristo, or if there were any leaders between them. Erymneus is known only from a passing reference by Athenaeus. Other important Peripatetic philosophers who lived during these centuries include Eudemus of Rhodes, Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, and Clearchus of Soli.

In 86 BC, Athens was sacked by the Roman general Lucius Cornelius Sulla; all the schools of philosophy in Athens were badly disrupted, and the Lyceum ceased to exist as a functioning institution. Ironically, this event seems to have brought new life to the Peripatetic school. Sulla brought the writings of Aristotle and Theophrastus back to Rome, where they became the basis of a new collection of Aristotle&#x27;s writings compiled by Andronicus of Rhodes which forms the basis of the &quot;Corpus Aristotelicum&quot; which exists today. Later Neoplatonist writers describe Andronicus, who lived around 50 BC, as the eleventh scholarch of the Peripatetic school, which would imply that he had two unnamed predecessors. There is considerable uncertainty over the issue, and Andronicus&#x27; pupil Boethus of Sidon is also described as the eleventh scholarch. It is quite possible that Andronicus set up a new school where he taught Boethus.

Whereas the earlier Peripatetics had sought to extend and develop Aristotle&#x27;s works, from the time of Andronicus the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work. The most important figure in the Roman era is Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 200 AD) who wrote commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s writings. With the rise of Neoplatonism (and Christianity) in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end, but the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle&#x27;s philosophy within their own system, and produced many commentaries on Aristotle&#x27;s works.

==Influence==
The last philosophers in classical antiquity to comment on Aristotle were Simplicius and Boethius in the 6th century AD. After this, although his works were mostly lost to the west, they were maintained in the east where they were incorporated into early Islamic philosophy. Some of the greatest Peripatetic philosophers in the Islamic philosophical tradition were Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd). By the 12th century, Aristotle&#x27;s works began being translated into Latin (see Latin translations of the 12th century), and Scholastic philosophy gradually developed under such names as Thomas Aquinas, taking its tone and complexion from the writings of Aristotle, the commentaries of Averroes, and &quot;The Book of Healing&quot; of Avicenna.

<text>William Froude (; 28 November 1810 – 4 May 1879) was an English engineer, hydrodynamicist and naval architect. He was the first to formulate reliable laws for the resistance that water offers to ships (such as the hull speed equation) and for predicting their stability.

==Biography==


Froude was born at Dartington, Devon, England, the son of Robert Froude, Archdeacon of Totnes and was educated at Westminster School and Oriel College, Oxford, graduating with a first in mathematics in 1832.

His first employment was as a surveyor on the South Eastern Railway which, in 1837, led to Brunel giving him responsibility for the construction of a section of the Bristol and Exeter Railway. It was here that he developed his empirical method of setting out track transition curves and introduced an alternative design to the helicoidal skew arch bridge at Rewe and Cowley Bridge Junction, near Exeter. During this period he lived in Cullompton and was Vicar&#x27;s Warden at St Andrew&#x27;s Church from 1842 to 1844. He organised, and paid a large amount to the rebuilding of the chancel and other restoration work. He also offered to pay to restore the nave if local people would pay 10% of the cost but this offer was refused. On completion of the Bristol to Exeter line in 1844 he left the town.

At Brunel&#x27;s invitation Froude turned his attention to the stability of ships in a seaway and his 1861 paper to the Institution of Naval Architects became influential in ship design. This led to a commission to identify the most efficient hull shape, which he was able to fulfil by reference to scale models: he established a formula (now known as the Froude number) by which the results of small-scale tests could be used to predict the behaviour of full-sized hulls. He built a sequence of 3, 6 and (shown in the picture) 12 foot scale models and used them in towing trials to establish resistance and scaling laws.

His experiments were vindicated in full-scale trials conducted by the Admiralty and as a result the first ship test tank was built, at public expense, at his home in Torquay. Here he was able to combine mathematical expertise with practical experimentation to such good effect that his methods are still followed today.

Froude also tested the &quot;wave-line&quot; theory of John Scott Russell. The model &quot;Raven&quot; had sharp lines in accordance with Scott Russell&#x27;s theory. The &quot;Swan&quot; had fuller lines with blunt ends. &quot;Raven&quot; had less resistance at low speeds of the two, but &quot;Swan&quot; had less resistance at higher speeds. This showed that the &quot;wave-line&quot; theory was not as universal as claimed, and was the start of a better understanding of hull resistance.

In 1877, he was commissioned by the Admiralty to produce a machine capable of absorbing and measuring the power of large naval engines. He invented and built the world&#x27;s first water brake dynamometer, sometimes known as the hydraulic dynamometer.

While on holiday as an official guest of the Royal Navy he died in Simonstown, South Africa, where he was buried with full naval honours.

He was the brother of James Anthony Froude, a historian, and Hurrell Froude, writer and priest. William was married to Catherine Henrietta Elizabeth Holdsworth, daughter of the Governor of Dartmouth Castle, mercantile magnate and member of Parliament Arthur Howe Holdsworth.

His son Robert Edmund Froude, born in 1846, would go on to co-found Heenan &amp; Froude Ltd in Birmingham. The company initially produced water brake dynamometers following from his father&#x27;s design and later a range of dynamometers of various types. The Froude name as a trademark has been an element in a number of equity transitions and exists currently under the monomym &quot;Froude,&quot; a group which comprises Froude, Inc. (USA) and Froude, Ltd. (UK). Robert Froude would also further his father&#x27;s theoretical work describing blade element theory in papers authored to the Royal Institution of Naval Architects. This included a description of momentum theory. Blade element theory and momentum theory would later be unified within the more comprehensive blade element momentum theory.

<text>The Miwok (also spelled Miwuk, Mi-Wuk, or Me-Wuk) are members of four linguistically related Native American groups indigenous to what is now Northern California, who traditionally spoke one of the Miwok languages in the Utian family. The word &quot;Miwok&quot; means &quot;people&quot; in the Miwok languages.

==Subgroups==

Anthropologists commonly divide the Miwok into four geographically and culturally diverse ethnic subgroups. These distinctions were not used among the Miwok before European contact.
*&quot;Plains and Sierra Miwok&quot;: from the western slope and foothills of the Sierra Nevada, the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
*&quot;Coast Miwok&quot;: from present day location of Marin County and southern Sonoma County (includes the &quot;Bodega Bay Miwok&quot; and &quot;Marin Miwok&quot;)
*&quot;Lake Miwok&quot;: from Clear Lake basin of Lake County
*&quot;Bay Miwok&quot;: from present-day location of Contra Costa County

==Federally recognized tribes==

The United States Bureau of Indian Affairs officially recognizes eleven tribes of Miwok descent in California. They are as follows:
* Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians
* California Valley Miwok Tribe, formerly known as the Sheep Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians 
* Chicken Ranch Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians
* Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, formerly known as the Federated Coast Miwok
* Ione Band of Miwok Indians, of Ione, California
* Jackson Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians
* Middletown Rancheria (members of this tribe are of Pomo, Lake Miwok, and Wintun descent)
* Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians, Shingle Springs Rancheria (Verona Tract)
* Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria
* United Auburn Indian Community of Auburn Rancheria
* Wilton Rancheria Indian Tribe

===Non-federally recognized tribes===

* Miwok Tribe of the El Dorado Rancheria
* Nashville-Eldorado Miwok Tribe
* Colfax-Todds Valley Consolidated Tribe of the Colfax Rancheria
* Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation
* Calaveras Band of Mi-Wuk Indians
* Miwok of Buena Vista Rancheria
* River Valley Miwok Indians, formally known as Historical Families of Wilton Rancheria

==History==

The predominant theory regarding the settlement of the Americas dates the original migrations from Asia to around 20,000 years ago across the Bering Strait land bridge, but anthropologist Otto von Sadovszky claims that the Miwok and some other northern California tribes descend from Siberians who arrived in California by sea around 3,000 years ago.

==Culture==
The Miwok lived in small bands without centralized political authority before contact with European Americans in 1769. They had domesticated dogs and cultivated tobacco, but were otherwise complex hunter-gatherers.

===Cuisine===
The Sierra Miwok harvested acorns from the California Black Oak. In fact, the modern-day extent of the California Black Oak forests in some areas of Yosemite National Park is partially due to cultivation by Miwok tribes. They burned understory vegetation to reduce the fraction of Ponderosa Pine. Nearly every other kind of edible vegetable matter was used as a food source, including bulbs, seeds, and fungi. Animals were hunted with arrows, clubs or snares, depending on the species and the situation. Grasshoppers were a highly prized food source, as were mussels for those groups adjacent to the Stanislaus River. Coastal Miwok were known to have predominantly relied on food gathered from the inland side of the Marin peninsula (modern San Pablo bay, lakes, and land based foods), but to have also engaged in diving for abalone in the Pacific Ocean.

The Miwok ate meals according to appetite rather than at regular times. They stored food for later consumption, primarily in flat-bottomed baskets.

===Religion===
The Miwok creation story and narratives tend to be similar to those of other natives of Northern California. Miwok had totem animals, identified with one of two moieties, which were in turn associated respectively with land and water. These totem animals were not thought of as literal ancestors of humans, but rather as predecessors.

===Languages===
===Sports===
Miwok people played mixed-gender games on a playing field called &quot;poscoi a we&#x27;a&quot;. A unique game was played with young men and women. Similarly to soccer, the object was to put an elk hide ball through the goalpost. The girls were allowed to do anything, including kicking the ball and picking it up and running with it. The boys were only allowed to use their feet, but if a girl was holding it he could pick her up and carry her towards his goal.

==Population==
In 1770, there were an estimated 500 Lake Miwok, 1,500 Coast Miwok, and 9,000 Plains and Sierra Miwok, totaling about 11,000 people, according to historian Alfred L. Kroeber, although this may be a serious undercount; for example, he did not identify the Bay Miwok.

History professors from California estimate the total Miwok population was 25,000 people, prior to 1769. 

The 1910 Census reported only 671 Miwok total, and the 1930 Census, 491. See history of each Miwok group for more information. Today there are about 3,500 Miwok in total.

==Influences on popular culture==
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; films feature a fictional species of forest-dwelling creatures known as Ewoks, who are ostensibly named after the Miwok. 

The Miwok people are encountered in Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s book &quot;The Years of Rice and Salt&quot;. In an alternate history scenario depicted in the book, they are the first group of Native Americans encountered by the first Chinese to discover the continent.

<doc id="529417" wikidata="Q1256820" url="?curid=529417" title="Coast Miwok">
<text>The Coast Miwok are an Indigenous people of California that were the second-largest tribe of the Miwok people. Coast Miwok inhabited the general area of present-day Marin County and southern Sonoma County in Northern California, from the Golden Gate north to Duncans Point and eastward to Sonoma Creek. Coast Miwok included the Bodega Bay Miwok, or Olamentko (Olamentke), from authenticated Miwok villages around Bodega Bay, the Marin Miwok, or Hookooeko (Huukuiko), and Southern Sonoma Miwok, or Lekahtewutko (Lekatuit). While they did not have an overarching name for themselves, the Coast Miwok word for people, &quot;Micha-ko&quot;, was suggested by A. L. Kroeber as a possible endonym, keeping with a common practice among tribal groups and the ethnographers studying them in the early 20th century and with the term &quot;Miwok&quot; itself, which is the Central Sierra Miwok word for &#x27;people&#x27;.
==Culture==
The Coast Miwok spoke their own Coast Miwok language in the Utian linguistic group. They lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small bands without centralized political authority. In the springtime they would head to the coasts to hunt salmon and other seafood, including seaweed. Otherwise their staple foods were primarily acorns—particularly from black and tan oak–nuts and wild game, such as deer and cottontail rabbits and black-tailed deer, &quot;Odocoileus hemionus columbianus&quot;, a coastal subspecies of the California mule deer, &quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;. When hunting deer, Miwok hunters traditionally used Brewer&#x27;s angelica, &quot;Angelica breweri&quot; to eliminate their own scent. Miwok did not typically hunt bears. Yerba buena tea leaves were used medicinally.

Tattooing was a traditional practice among Coast Miwok, and they burned poison oak for a pigment. Their traditional houses, called &quot;kotcha&quot;, were constructed with slabs of tule grass or redwood bark in a cone-shaped form.

=== Cultural subdivisions ===
In C. Hart Merriam&#x27;s discussions with Coast Miwok peoples, he identified three cultural tribes:

* Olamentko, pronounced O-la-MENT-ko (around Bodega Bay) and now called Olamentke
* Lekahtewutko, pronounced Lek-KAH-te-WUT-ko (in south-central Sonoma County) and now called Lekatuit
* Hookooeko, pronounced HOO-koo-EE-ko (in Marin County and southern Sonoma County), and now called Huukuiko, whom the Olamentko called Olumko, or &quot;South People.&quot;

These tribes did not have a political structure and so are not &quot;tribes&quot; in that sense. Rather, chiefs or headmen (&quot;oi-bu&quot; in Olamentko and &quot;hoipu&quot; in Hookooeko) were empowered at the tribelet level. The Coast Miwok did not have a single name for all three tribes, describing themselves instead by tribe, tribelet, or village, depending on the context. Using Merriam&#x27;s divisions, the tribelets as shown on the map to the right – itself derived from Milliken – can be classified as:

* Olamentko
** Bodega Bay
* Lekahtewutko
** Bloomfield
* Hookooeko
** Alaguali
** Chocuyen
** Gualen
** Huimen
** Olema
** Olompali
** Omomi
** Petaluma (though Merriam puts the southernmost boundary of the Lekahtewutko a mile north of Petaluma and its associated villages, which is in the middle of Milliken&#x27;s boundaries for this tribelet.)
** Tamal Aguasto (though the Tamal people lived in the Miller Creek watershed to the north in what is now Terra Linda and the Aguasto to the south, there was enough intermarriage in the early 19th century that Milliken, the source of this article&#x27;s map, lumps them into a single tribelet.)
** North Tomales Bay
** South Tomales Bay

===Language===
The Coast Miwok language is still spoken, but the Bodega dialect, spoken by the Olamentko group, is documented in Callaghan (1970). From speaking with Coast Miwok people in the early 1900s, Merriam believed that the Lekahtewutko and Hookooeko dialects were substantially the same.

=== Ethnobotany ===
Ethnobotany of the Coast Miwok. They had extensive knowledge and relationships with local flora. Presumably every plant had a name and purpose. Notable engagement with plants may be viewed from four perspectives: medicinal uses, food sustenance, technology and spiritual significance. 

Medicinal uses: 

The California Floristic province provides an abundant natural pharmacy for healing and known developed treatments for maladies include but are not limited to: analgesic (pain relief), hematology (blood purifier), snakebite, respiratory, gastrointestinal and dermatological (skin) applications.

* Yarrow &quot;Achillea sp&quot;.(respiratory), Dogwood &quot;Cornus sericea&quot; (pain relief) and Willow &quot;Salix spp.&quot; (pain relief), California Coffeeberry &quot;Frangula californica&quot; (gastrointestinal), Death Camas &quot;Toxciscordion fremontii&quot; (dermatological), Blue Elderberry &quot;Sambucus cerulea&quot; (respiratory, dermatology, gastrointestinal and hematology), California Bay &quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;, (gastrointestinal), Yerba Buena &quot;Clinopodium douglasii&quot; (hematology), Pacific Madrone &quot;Arbutus menziesii&quot; (dermatology, gastrointestinal), Yerba Santa &quot;Eridictyon californicum&quot; (respiratory, dermatological, hematology)

==== Food Sustenance ====

Comparable to the modern concepts of farming and restoration, Coast Miwok practiced their own methods. Coast Miwok were active stewards to encourage and sustain &quot;ecological life-giving sources&quot;, otherwise known as resources. For example cultivation efforts involved seed collection, storing seeds, propagation, and transplantation. Other methods include prescribed burns and generational management of oak tree groves or stands.

* Acorns and Nuts:
** &quot;Fagaceae&quot; or Beech family used acorns: Golden Chinquapin &quot;Chrysolepis chrysophylla,&quot; Black Oak &quot;Q. kelloggii&quot;, Coast Live Oak &quot;Q. agrifolia&quot;, Valley Oak &quot;Q. lobata&quot;. Tan Oak &quot;Lithocarpus densiflorus&quot; Hazel Nut &quot;Corylus cornuta&quot;&quot;.&quot; California Bay &quot;Umbellularia californica&quot;&quot;.&quot; 
* Seeds:
** Primrose family &quot;Onagraceae&quot;: &quot;Clarkia spp.&quot; Sunflower family &quot;Asteraceae&quot;: Tidy Tips &quot;Layia spp&quot;&quot;.,&quot; Mule’s ear &quot;Wyethia spp&quot;&quot;.,&quot;Tarweeds &quot;Madia spp. Hezmizonia spp.&quot;&quot;,&quot;Checkerbloom &quot;Sidalcea malviflora&quot;
* Berries: Thimbleberry &quot;Rubus parviflorus&quot;, Currants and Gooseberry &quot;Ribes spp.&quot;, Blackberry &quot;Rubus ursinus&quot;, Wild Strawberry &quot;Fragaria vesca&quot;., Huckleberry &quot;Vaccinium ovatum,&quot; Bilberry &quot;Vaccinium cespitosum&quot;, Salmon Berry &quot;Rubus spectabilis&quot;
* Bulbs and shoots: Tule shoots &quot;Schoenoplectus sp., Allium spp&quot;. Wild onion, Lily &quot;Fritillaria spp.&quot; Mariposa lily &quot;Calochortus&quot; &quot;spp.&quot; Ithuriel&#x27;s spear &quot;Triteleia laxa,&quot; 
* Greens&quot;:&quot; Clover&quot;,&quot; Miner’s lettuce &quot;Claytonia spp.&quot;

Technology

Building shelter, assisting travel and tools were specialized by the flora available. Coast Miwok utilized various species for their intrinsic properties, fire and rot resistance, fiber strength, flexibility and color ect. 

* Shelter: Sequoia sempervirens, Redwood tree bark used as building materials for constructing shelter. Ferns for cross-thatching.
* Travel: Sedges &quot;Schoenoplectus acutus&quot; and &quot;S. californicu&quot;s were used to make Tule Reed canoes

===Religion===

Coast Miwok people&#x27;s world view included animism, and one form this took was the Kuksu religion that was evident in Central and Northern California. This included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms. Kuksu was shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the Pomo, also Maidu, Ohlone, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts. However Kroeber observed less &quot;specialized cosmogony&quot; in the Miwok, which he termed one of the &quot;southern Kuksu-dancing groups&quot;, in comparison to the Maidu and other northern California tribes.

Coast Miwok mythology and narratives were similar to those of other natives of Central and Northern California. The Coast Miwok believed in animal and human spirits, and saw the animal spirits as their ancestors. Coyote was seen as their ancestor and creator god. In their stories, the Earth began with land formed out of the Pacific Ocean.

===Traditional narratives===
In their myths, legends, tales, and histories, the Coast Miwok participated in the general cultural pattern of Central California.

==History==
Coastal populations like the Coast Miwok were likely some of the First People to establish on the North American continent. Evidence to suggest this migration path and timeline is supported by the theory of the Kelp Highway and discovery of footprints in White Sands New Mexico date of arrival as far back as 23–21,000 years ago. Before and after the glacial maximum the sea level and coast line drastically changed and archeological sites are likely underwater as the sea level has risen over 400 ft since 18,000 years ago and the coast line reduced by over 30 miles in some areas.

Documentation of Miwok peoples dates back as early as 1579 by a priest on a ship under the command of Sir Francis Drake. Other verification of occupancy exists from Spanish and Russian voyagers between 1595 and 1808. Over 1,000 prehistoric charmstones and numerous arrowheads have been unearthed at Tolay Lake in Southern Sonoma County – some dating back 4,000 years. The lake was thought to be a sacred site and ceremonial gathering and healing place for the Miwok and others in the region.

Coast Miwok would travel and camp on the coast and bays at peak fishing seasons.

After the Europeans arrived in California, the population declined from diseases introduced by the Europeans. Beginning in 1783, mission ecclesiastical records show that Coast Miwok individuals began to join Mission San Francisco de Asis, now known as Mission Dolores. They started joining that mission in large numbers in 1803, when the marriages of 49 couples from their Huimen and Guaulen local tribes (San Rafael and Bolinas Bay) appeared in the Mission San Francisco Book of Marriages. Local tribes from farther and farther north along the shore of San Pablo Bay moved to Mission San Francisco through 1812. Then in 1814 the Spanish authorities began to split the northern groups—Alagualis, Chocoimes (alias Sonomas), Olompalis, and Petalumas—sending a portion of each group to Mission San Francisco and another portion to Mission San Jose in the southeast portion of the San Francisco Bay Area. By the end of 1817, 850 Coast Miwok had been converted.

Mission San Rafael was founded by the Spanish Franciscans in Coast Miwok territory in the late fall of 1817. By that time the only Coast Miwok people still on their land were those on the Pacific Coast of the Marin Peninsula, from Point Reyes north to Bodega Bay. The Spanish authorities brought most of the Coast Miwoks who had been at Missions San Francisco and San Jose back north to form a founding population for Mission San Rafael. But some who had married Ohlone or Bay Miwok-speaking Mission Indians remained south of the Golden Gate. Over time in the 1820s Mission San Rafael became a mission for Coast Miwok and Pomo speakers. Mission San Francisco Solano, founded in 1823 in the Sonoma Valley (the easternmost traditional Coast Miwok region), came to be predominately a mission for Indians that spoke the Wappo or Patwin languages.

At the end of the Mission period (1769–1834) the Coast Miwoks were freed from the control of the Franciscan missionaries. At the same time the Mission lands were secularized and ceded to Californios. Most Coast Miwok began to live in servitude on the ranchos for the new California land grant owners, such as those who went to work for General Mariano G. Vallejo at Rancho Petaluma Adobe. The ranch owners were dependent upon the labor pool of Indians with agricultural and ranching skills. Other Miwok chose to live independently in bands like those at Rancho Olompali and Rancho Nicasio.

In 1837, a smallpox epidemic decimated all the native populations of the Sonoma region, and the Coast Miwok population continued to decline rapidly from other diseases brought in from the Spaniards as well as the Russians at Fort Ross.

By the beginning of California statehood (1850), many Miwok of Marin and Sonoma Counties were making the best of a difficult situation by earning their livelihoods through farm labor or fishing within their traditional homelands. Others chose to work as seasonal or year-round laborers on the ranches that were rapidly passing from Mexican ownership into Anglo-American ownership.

===Olompali and Nicasio===
After Mission San Rafael closed during the 1834–1836 period, the Mexican government deeded most of the land to Californios, but allowed the Miwok ex- to own land at two locations within traditional Coast Miwok territory: Olompali and Nicasio.

The Coast Miwok leader Camilo Ynitia, secured a land grant of 2 sq. leagues known as &quot;Rancho Olompali&quot;, from Governor Micheltorena of Alta California in 1843, which included the prehistoric Miwok village of Olompali (his home village) and is north of present-day Novato.

The village of Olompali dates back to 500, had been a main center in 1200, and might have been the largest Miwok village in Marin County. Ynitia held onto the &quot;Rancho Olompoli&quot; land title for nine years, but in 1852 he sold most of the land to James Black of Marin. He retained called &quot;Apalacocha.&quot; His daughter eventually sold &quot;Apalacocha&quot;.

The other Miwok-owned rancho was at &quot;Rancho Nicasio&quot; northwest of San Rafael. Near the time of secularization (1835), the Church granted the &quot;San Rafael Christian Indians&quot; 20 leagues () of Mission lands from present-day Nicasio to the Tomales Bay. About 500 Miwok people relocated to &quot;Rancho Nicasio&quot;. By 1850 they had one league of land left. This radical reduction of land was a result of illegal confiscation of land by Europeans under protest by native residents. In 1870, José Calistro, the last community leader at Nicasio, purchased the small surrounding parcel. Calistro died in 1875, and in 1876 the land was transferred by his will to his four children. In 1880 there were 36 Miwok people at Nicasio. The population was persuaded to leave in the 1880s when Marin County curtailed funds to all Miwok (except those at Marshall) who were not living at the Poor Farm, a place for indigent peoples.

Some Coast Miwok persons were enslaved. In 1846, Joseph Warren Revere (career militant and grandson of Paul Revere) purchased Rancho San Geronimo. It was of Coast Miwok land, first seized by Manuel Micheltorena in 1844 during the Mexican-American war. Revere forced enslaved Coast Miwok people to operate the plantation, selling timber and crops.

By the early 20th century, a few Miwok families pursued fishing for their livelihoods; one family continued commercial fishing into the 1970s, while another family maintained an oyster harvesting business. When this activity was neither in season nor profitable, Miwok people of this area sought agricultural employment, which required an lifestyle. The preferred locality for such work was within Marin and Sonoma counties.

===Recognition===

The Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, formerly the Federated Coast Miwok, gained federal recognition of their tribal status in December 2000. The new tribe consists of people of both Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo descent.

==Population==

Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. &quot;(See Population of Native California.)&quot; Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Coast Miwok at 1,500. Sherburne F. Cook raised this figure to 2,000.

The population in 1848 was estimated as 300, and it had dropped to 60 in 1880.

==Notable people==

* José Calistro was the last community leader at Nicasio.
* Chief Marin was a Coast Miwok of the Huimen local tribe, baptized at around age 20 in 1801 at Mission San Francisco and noted as an at Mission San Rafael in the 1820s. He died on March 15, 1839. Marin County and the Marin Islands are named in his honor. He was the &quot;great chief of the tribe &quot;Licatiut&quot;&quot;, according to General Vallejo&#x27;s semi-historical report to the first California State Legislature (1850). He was likely, then, of the Lekahtewutko from southern Sonoma County.
* Quintin, was renowned as the sub-chief of Marin and skipper at Mission Dolores, according to General Vallejo. San Quentin Peninsula (1840) is reputed to be named after him. San Quentin State Prison was added much later.
* Julia F. Parker, notable basket weaver.
* Ponponio (aka Pomponio) was baptized in 1803 at around age four at Mission San Francisco. He was a leader of a band of Native American fugitives in California who called themselves &quot;Los Insurgentes&quot;. Evading authorities, he was eventually captured in Marin County, and executed in Monterey in 1824.
*Greg Sarris is the current Tribal Chairman of the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, also a college professor and author.
*William Smith was born a Bodega Bay Coast Miwok (Olamentko), was forced relocation to Lake County during the late 19th century, but returned to Bodega Bay where he and his relatives founded the commercial fishing industry in the area.
*Tsupu, a Coast Miwok elder
*Camilo Ynitia (1816–1856) was a Coast Miwok leader who became the owner of an land grant secured for the Miwok, named &quot;Rancho Olompali,&quot; now the Olompali State Historic Park. Ynitia also forged a ranch labor-alliance with General Vallejo, and secured semblance of peace with the white settlers (about 1830s-1840s).

<text>In string theory, D-branes, short for Dirichlet membrane, are a class of extended objects upon which open strings can end with Dirichlet boundary conditions, after which they are named. 
D-branes are typically classified by their spatial dimension, which is indicated by a number written after the &quot;D.&quot; A D0-brane is a single point, a D1-brane is a line (sometimes called a &quot;D-string&quot;), a D2-brane is a plane, and a D25-brane fills the highest-dimensional space considered in bosonic string theory. There are also instantonic D(−1)-branes, which are localized in both space and time.

== Discovery ==
D-branes were discovered by Jin Dai, Robert Leigh, and Joseph Polchinski, and independently by Petr Hořava, in 1989. In 1995, Polchinski identified D-branes with black p-brane solutions of supergravity, a discovery that triggered the second superstring revolution and led to both holographic and M-theory dualities.

== Theoretical background ==

The equations of motion of string theory require that the endpoints of an open string (a string with endpoints) satisfy one of two types of boundary conditions: The Neumann boundary condition, corresponding to free endpoints moving through spacetime at the speed of light, or the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which pin the string endpoint. Each coordinate of the string must satisfy one or the other of these conditions. There can also exist strings with mixed boundary conditions, where the two endpoints satisfy NN, DD, ND and DN boundary conditions. If &quot;p&quot; spatial dimensions satisfy the Neumann boundary condition, then the string endpoint is confined to move within a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional hyperplane. This hyperplane provides one description of a D&quot;p&quot;-brane.

Although rigid in the limit of zero coupling, the spectrum of open strings ending on a D-brane contains modes associated with its fluctuations, implying that D-branes are dynamical objects. When formula_1 D-branes are nearly coincident, the spectrum of strings stretching between them becomes very rich. One set of modes produce a non-abelian gauge theory on the world-volume. Another set of modes is an formula_2 dimensional matrix for each transverse dimension of the brane. If these matrices commute, they may be diagonalized, and the eigenvalues define the position of the formula_1 D-branes in space. More generally, the branes are described by non-commutative geometry, which allows exotic behavior such as the Myers effect, in which a collection of D&quot;p&quot;-branes expand into a D(&quot;p&quot;+2)-brane.

Tachyon condensation is a central concept in this field. Ashoke Sen has argued that in Type IIB string theory, tachyon condensation allows (in the absence of Neveu-Schwarz 3-form flux) an arbitrary D-brane configuration to be obtained from a stack of D9 and anti D9-branes. Edward Witten has shown that such configurations will be classified by the K-theory of the spacetime. Tachyon condensation is still very poorly understood. This is due to the lack of an exact string field theory that would describe the off-shell evolution of the tachyon.

== Braneworld cosmology ==

This has implications for physical cosmology. Because string theory implies that the Universe has more dimensions than we expect—26 for bosonic string theories and 10 for superstring theories—we have to find a reason why the extra dimensions are not apparent. One possibility would be that the visible Universe is in fact a very large D-brane extending over three spatial dimensions. Material objects, made of open strings, are bound to the D-brane, and cannot move &quot;at right angles to reality&quot; to explore the Universe outside the brane. This scenario is called a brane cosmology. The force of gravity is &quot;not&quot; due to open strings; the gravitons which carry gravitational forces are vibrational states of &quot;closed&quot; strings. Because closed strings do not have to be attached to D-branes, gravitational effects could depend upon the extra dimensions orthogonal to the brane.

== D-brane scattering ==
When two D-branes approach each other the interaction is captured by the one loop annulus amplitude of strings between the two branes. The scenario of two parallel branes approaching each other at a constant velocity can be mapped to the problem of two stationary branes that are rotated relative to each other by some angle. The annulus amplitude yields singularities that correspond to the on-shell production of open strings stretched between the two branes. This is true irrespective of the charge of the D-branes. At non-relativistic scattering velocities the open strings may be described by a low-energy effective action that contains two complex scalar fields that are coupled via a term formula_4. Thus, as the field formula_5 (separation of the branes) changes, the mass of the field formula_6 changes. This induces open string production and as a result the two scattering branes will be trapped.

== Gauge theories ==

The arrangement of D-branes constricts the types of string states which can exist in a system. For example, if we have two parallel D2-branes, we can easily imagine strings stretching from brane 1 to brane 2 or vice versa. (In most theories, strings are &quot;oriented&quot; objects: each one carries an &quot;arrow&quot; defining a direction along its length.) The open strings permissible in this situation then fall into two categories, or &quot;sectors&quot;: those originating on brane 1 and terminating on brane 2, and those originating on brane 2 and terminating on brane 1. Symbolically, we say we have the [1 2] and the [2 1] sectors. In addition, a string may begin and end on the same brane, giving [1 1] and [2 2] sectors. (The numbers inside the brackets are called Chan–Paton indices, but they are really just labels identifying the branes.) A string in either the [1 2] or the [2 1] sector has a minimum length: it cannot be shorter than the separation between the branes. All strings have some tension, against which one must pull to lengthen the object; this pull does work on the string, adding to its energy. Because string theories are by nature relativistic, adding energy to a string is equivalent to adding mass, by Einstein&#x27;s relation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc2&quot;. Therefore, the separation between D-branes controls the minimum mass open strings may have.

Furthermore, affixing a string&#x27;s endpoint to a brane influences the way the string can move and vibrate. Because particle states &quot;emerge&quot; from the string theory as the different vibrational states the string can experience, the arrangement of D-branes controls the types of particles present in the theory. The simplest case is the [1 1] sector for a D&quot;p&quot;-brane, that is to say the strings which begin and end on any particular D-brane of &quot;p&quot; dimensions. Examining the consequences of the Nambu–Goto action (and applying the rules of quantum mechanics to quantize the string), one finds that among the spectrum of particles is one resembling the photon, the fundamental quantum of the electromagnetic field. The resemblance is precise: a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional version of the electromagnetic field, obeying a &quot;p&quot;-dimensional analogue of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, exists on every D&quot;p&quot;-brane.

In this sense, then, one can say that string theory &quot;predicts&quot; electromagnetism: D-branes are a necessary part of the theory if we permit open strings to exist, and all D-branes carry an electromagnetic field on their volume.

Other particle states originate from strings beginning and ending on the same D-brane. Some correspond to massless particles like the photon; also in this group are a set of massless scalar particles. If a D&quot;p&quot;-brane is embedded in a spacetime of &quot;d&quot; spatial dimensions, the brane carries (in addition to its Maxwell field) a set of &quot;d&quot; − &quot;p&quot; massless scalars (particles which do not have polarizations like the photons making up light). Intriguingly, there are just as many massless scalars as there are directions perpendicular to the brane; the &quot;geometry&quot; of the brane arrangement is closely related to the &quot;quantum field theory&quot; of the particles existing on it. In fact, these massless scalars are Goldstone excitations of the brane, corresponding to the different ways the symmetry of empty space can be broken. Placing a D-brane in a universe breaks the symmetry among locations, because it defines a particular place, assigning a special meaning to a particular location along each of the &quot;d&quot; − &quot;p&quot; directions perpendicular to the brane.

The quantum version of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetism is only one kind of gauge theory, a U(1) gauge theory where the gauge group is made of unitary matrices of order 1. D-branes can be used to generate gauge theories of higher order, in the following way:

Consider a group of &quot;N&quot; separate D&quot;p&quot;-branes, arranged in parallel for simplicity. The branes are labeled 1,2...,&quot;N&quot; for convenience. Open strings in this system exist in one of many sectors: the strings beginning and ending on some brane &quot;i&quot; give that brane a Maxwell field and some massless scalar fields on its volume. The strings stretching from brane &quot;i&quot; to another brane &quot;j&quot; have more intriguing properties. For starters, it is worthwhile to ask which sectors of strings can interact with one another. One straightforward mechanism for a string interaction is for two strings to join endpoints (or, conversely, for one string to &quot;split down the middle&quot; and make two &quot;daughter&quot; strings). Since endpoints are restricted to lie on D-branes, it is evident that a [1 2] string may interact with a [2 3] string, but not with a [3 4] or a [4 17] one. The masses of these strings will be influenced by the separation between the branes, as discussed above, so for simplicity&#x27;s sake, we can imagine the branes squeezed closer and closer together until they lie atop one another. If we regard two overlapping branes as distinct objects, then we still have all the sectors we had before, but without the effects due to the brane separations.

The zero-mass states in the open-string particle spectrum for a system of &quot;N&quot; coincident D-branes yields a set of interacting quantum fields which is exactly a U(&quot;N&quot;) gauge theory. (The string theory does contain other interactions, but they are only detectable at very high energies.) Gauge theories were not invented starting with bosonic or fermionic strings; they originated from a different area of physics, and have become quite useful in their own right. If nothing else, the relation between D-brane geometry and gauge theory offers a useful pedagogical tool for explaining gauge interactions, even if string theory fails to be the &quot;theory of everything&quot;.

== Black holes ==

Another important use of D-branes has been in the study of black holes. Since the 1970s, scientists have debated the problem of black holes having entropy. Consider, as a thought experiment, dropping an amount of hot gas into a black hole. Since the gas cannot escape from the hole&#x27;s gravitational pull, its entropy would seem to have vanished from the universe. In order to maintain the second law of thermodynamics, one must postulate that the black hole gained whatever entropy the infalling gas originally had. Attempting to apply quantum mechanics to the study of black holes, Stephen Hawking discovered that a hole should emit energy with the characteristic spectrum of thermal radiation. The characteristic temperature of this Hawking radiation is given by
formula_7
where formula_8 is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, formula_9 is the black hole&#x27;s mass and formula_10 is the Boltzmann constant.

Using this expression for the Hawking temperature, and assuming that a zero-mass black hole has zero entropy, one can use thermodynamic arguments to derive the &quot;Bekenstein entropy&quot;:
formula_11

The Bekenstein entropy is proportional to the black hole mass squared; because the Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass, the Bekenstein entropy is proportional to the black hole&#x27;s &quot;surface area.&quot; In fact,
formula_12
where formula_13 is the Planck length.

The concept of black hole entropy poses some interesting conundra. In an ordinary situation, a system has entropy when a large number of different &quot;microstates&quot; can satisfy the same macroscopic condition. For example, given a box full of gas, many different arrangements of the gas atoms can have the same total energy. However, a black hole was believed to be a featureless object (in John Wheeler&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Black holes have no hair&quot;). What, then, are the &quot;degrees of freedom&quot; which can give rise to black hole entropy?

String theorists have constructed models in which a black hole is a very long (and hence very massive) string. This model gives rough agreement with the expected entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole, but an exact proof has yet to be found one way or the other. The chief difficulty is that it is relatively easy to count the degrees of freedom quantum strings possess &quot;if they do not interact with one another.&quot; This is analogous to the ideal gas studied in introductory thermodynamics: the easiest situation to model is when the gas atoms do not have interactions among themselves. Developing the kinetic theory of gases in the case where the gas atoms or molecules experience inter-particle forces (like the van der Waals force) is more difficult. However, a world without interactions is an uninteresting place: most significantly for the black hole problem, gravity is an interaction, and so if the &quot;string coupling&quot; is turned off, no black hole could ever arise. Therefore, calculating black hole entropy requires working in a regime where string interactions exist.

Extending the simpler case of non-interacting strings to the regime where a black hole could exist requires supersymmetry. In certain cases, the entropy calculation done for zero string coupling remains valid when the strings interact. The challenge for a string theorist is to devise a situation in which a black hole can exist which does not &quot;break&quot; supersymmetry. In recent years, this has been done by building black holes out of D-branes. Calculating the entropies of these hypothetical holes gives results which agree with the expected Bekenstein entropy. Unfortunately, the cases studied so far all involve higher-dimensional spaces – D5-branes in nine-dimensional space, for example. They do not directly apply to the familiar case, the Schwarzschild black holes observed in our own universe.

== History ==

Dirichlet boundary conditions and D-branes had a long &quot;pre-history&quot; before their full significance was recognized. A series of 1975–76 papers by Bardeen, Bars, Hanson and Peccei dealt with an early concrete proposal of interacting particles at the ends of strings (quarks interacting with QCD flux tubes), with dynamical boundary conditions for string endpoints where the Dirichlet conditions were dynamical rather than static. Mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions were first considered by Warren Siegel in 1976 as a means of lowering the critical dimension of open string theory from 26 or 10 to 4 (Siegel also cites unpublished work by Halpern, and a 1974 paper by Chodos and Thorn, but a reading of the latter paper shows that it is actually concerned with linear dilation backgrounds, not Dirichlet boundary conditions). This paper, though prescient, was little-noted in its time (a 1985 parody by Siegel, &quot;The Super-g String&quot;, contains an almost dead-on description of braneworlds). Dirichlet conditions for all coordinates including Euclidean time (defining what are now known as D-instantons) were introduced by Michael Green in 1977 as a means of introducing point-like structure into string theory, in an attempt to construct a string theory of the strong interaction. String compactifications studied by Harvey and Minahan, Ishibashi and Onogi, and Pradisi and Sagnotti in 1987–1989 also employed Dirichlet boundary conditions.

In 1989, Dai, Leigh, Polchinski, and Hořava independently, discovered that T-duality interchanges the usual Neumann boundary conditions with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This result implies that such boundary conditions must necessarily appear in regions of the moduli space of any open string theory. The Dai et al. paper also notes that the locus of the Dirichlet boundary conditions is dynamical, and coins the term Dirichlet-brane (D-brane) for the resulting object (this paper also coins orientifold for another object that arises under string T-duality). A 1989 paper by Leigh showed that D-brane dynamics are governed by the Dirac–Born–Infeld action. D-instantons were extensively studied by Green in the early 1990s, and were shown by Polchinski in 1994 to produce the nonperturbative string effects anticipated by Shenker. In 1995 Polchinski showed that D-branes are the sources of electric and magnetic Ramond–Ramond fields that are required by string duality, leading to rapid progress in the nonperturbative understanding of string theory.

<text>Martin Havlát (; born April 19, 1981) is a Czech former professional ice hockey player who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 2000 to 2016.

==Playing career==

===Ottawa Senators===
Havlát was selected from the Czech Extraliga in the first round of the 1999 NHL Entry Draft, 26th overall, by the Ottawa Senators. He remained in the Czech Republic for one more season before joining the Senators for his rookie NHL season in 2000–01. Havlát recorded 19 goals and 42 points in his first year and was a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy as the League&#x27;s rookie of the year. Playing for the Senators, he earned the nickname &quot;Mach 9&quot; for his speed and the jersey number he wore.

In Havlát&#x27;s third year with the club, he notched his second-consecutive 20-goal campaign with 24 goals and 59 points before helping the Senators on a 2003 playoff run to the Eastern Conference Finals. He was criticized in the second round by Philadelphia Flyers Head Coach Ken Hitchcock for his stickwork against the Flyers during the series. The Senators went on to eliminate Philadelphia in six games, but could not overcome the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the New Jersey Devils, in the third round. Havlát finished the playoffs with 11 points in 18 games.

During the 2003–04 NHL season, Ken Hitchcock made headlines once more with comments regarding a high-sticking incident with Havlát, saying that, &quot;Somebody is going to make him eat his lunch.&quot; Over the course of the campaign, Havlát was suspended on two occasions, totalling four games; once for kicking, and once for high-sticking. Despite missing time, however, he continued to improve offensively, with 31 goals and 68 points in 68 games, his most productive season with the Senators.

Due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Havlát spent the entirety of the following season back in the Czech Extraliga, as well as Russian Superleague (RSL), playing for several teams. As NHL play resumed in 2005–06, he was suspended once more early in the season on October 17, 2005, for five games following another kicking incident against Boston Bruins defenceman Hal Gill. After returning to the lineup, he suffered a shoulder injury against the Montreal Canadiens on November 29, which required surgery and kept him out for 59 games. He returned to the ice on April 15, 2006, against the Toronto Maple Leafs, almost exactly four months from the date of his surgery. After missing the majority of the regular season, Havlát enjoyed his most prolific playoffs as a Senator in 2006, recording 13 points in ten games as Ottawa was eliminated by the Buffalo Sabres in five games in the second round.

===Chicago Blackhawks===
During the 2006 off-season, Havlát, a restricted free agent, told the Senators that he would only sign a one-year deal so he could then test the free agent market in the next off-season. As a result, on July 9, 2006, Havlát was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks, along with Bryan Smolinski, in a three-way deal that also involved the San Jose Sharks acquiring Mark Bell for Tom Preissing and Josh Hennessy. After the trade, Havlát signed a three-year, $18 million contract with the Blackhawks. As his usual number 9 was retired by the Blackhawks for Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, he switched to 24.

On October 5, 2006, Havlát made his Blackhawks debut in outstanding fashion against the Nashville Predators by scoring two goals and two assists in an 8–6 win. Through the first seven games of the season, he was near or at the top of the League in scoring until he went down with an ankle sprain late in a game against the Dallas Stars on October 20, 2006. He returned to the Blackhawks lineup on December 9, 2006, against the Minnesota Wild, netting two goals and an assist, albeit in a losing effort. Havlát was also selected for the 2007 NHL All-Star Game that season. In April 2007, Havlát suffered a shoulder injury, which required off-season surgery. Despite a first season in Chicago partially marred by injuries, he produced at over a point-per-game pace, with 57 points in 56 games.
In the 2007–08 season, Havlát was limited to 35 games while scoring ten goals and 17 assists as he again struggled with injuries. The season marked a turning point for the team, however, as the Blackhawks&#x27; offense was immediately bolstered by the emergence of rookies Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews. The next season, in 2008–09, Havlát led a rejuvenated Blackhawks team in scoring with a career-high 77 points in 81 games. Chicago qualified for the post-season for the first time since 2002 that season. Playing the Calgary Flames in the opening round, Havlát registered two goals in the first game of the series, including a game-tying goal late in the third period and the game-winner just 12 seconds into overtime. The Blackhawks would defeat the Flames in six games before doing the same to the Vancouver Canucks in the second round. Meeting the Detroit Red Wings Western Conference Finals, Havlát was knocked out in Game 3 of the series from a hit delivered by defenceman Niklas Kronwall; Kronwall was given a five-minute major penalty and was ejected for the hit, while Havlát left the game after lying on the ice for several minutes.

Despite being named team MVP for the 2008–09 season, Havlát was not re-signed by the club. After three months of attempting to negotiate a long-term contract to remain with the team, Blackhawks General Manager Dale Tallon annulled previous discussions and refused to offer anything more than a one-year extension come July 1. The negotiations were well documented on both Havlát and his agent&#x27;s Twitter pages, with Havlát ominously stating, &quot;There&#x27;s something to be said for loyalty and honor.&quot; He followed this up by stating that he did not leave the team, but rather they left him.

===Minnesota Wild===
On July 1, 2009, Havlát signed a six-year, $30 million contract with the Minnesota Wild. Havlát wore number 14 in his first season with the Wild, but changed his number to 24 prior to the start of the 2010–11 season due to the off-season departure of forward Derek Boogaard, who wore the number previously.

===San Jose Sharks and New Jersey Devils===
On July 3, 2011, Havlát was traded to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for Dany Heatley. In the following 2011–12 season, on December 17, 2011, Havlát caught his skate on the bench and fell over the boards onto the ice, tearing his hamstring. He returned on March 17, 2012. On March 18, one day after returning, Havlát scored the game winning goal in overtime for the Sharks in defeating the Detroit Red Wings.

On May 1, 2013, against the Vancouver Canucks, Havlát suffered an injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the playoff quarter-finals. He returned in Game 3 of the semi-final on May 18 against the Los Angeles Kings, but suffered a spear from Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa 52 seconds into the game. In early June 2013, Havlát had a bilateral pelvic floor reconstruction and played his first game of the season on October 31, 2013. On December 31, he was placed on injured reserve with a lower body injury.

With his tenure with the Sharks largely affected by injury and a lack of productivity, Havlát became the first Sharks player in franchise history to be bought-out from the remaining year of his contract on June 27, 2014. Three days later, on July 1, Havlát, with the ambition to redeem himself, signed as an unrestricted free agent to a one-year contract with the New Jersey Devils.

===St. Louis Blues===
After going unsigned by New Jersey at the end of the season and over the summer, Havlat agreed to a professional try-out agreement with the Florida Panthers. Upon failing to secure a contract with Florida, the 2015–16 season began without Havlat having a contract. Havlat made another attempt, signing another professional tryout agreement on October 27, 2015, this time with the St. Louis Blues, earning himself a one-year contract on November 6, 2015. Havlat made an immediate impact with the Blues, scoring the game-winning goal in his Blues debut in against former club the New Jersey Devils. After just 2 games, the St. Louis Blues placed Havlat on unconditional waivers for the purpose of terminating his contract, at the request of Havlat, citing personal reasons on November 13, 2015. In August 2016, while working out with HC Kometa Brno of the Czech Extraliga, Havlát revealed that he requested the contract termination due to a groin injury, and that he intended to continue to practice with the team with the aim of returning to the NHL. However, he failed to attract NHL interest and eventually stopped working out with the team on January 25, 2017 after re-injuring his groin. Havlát ultimately announced his retirement on February 8, 2017.

==International play==


As a junior, Havlát helped the Czech Republic claim gold at the 2000 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Skellefteå and Umeå, Sweden. He also replicated his gold medal performance at the corresponding 2000 IIHF World Championship in Saint Petersburg for the senior Czech team.

Havlát then represented the Czechs at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, where he scored three goals in the tournament. He missed the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin due to a shoulder injury. In the 2011 World Championships in Bratislava and Košice, Slovakia, he was a member of the Czech team that claimed a bronze medal.

==Personal life==
Havlát has two siblings: a sister named Lenka and a brother named Slava. He can speak both English and Czech and lives in Brno, Czech Republic, during the off-season. His nephew, Borek Sedlák, is a Czech ski jumper.

<doc id="529420" wikidata="Q5252765" url="?curid=529420" title="Bay Miwok">
<text>The Bay Miwok are a cultural and linguistic group of Miwok, a Native American people in Northern California who live in Contra Costa County. They joined the Franciscan mission system during the early nineteenth century, suffered a devastating population decline, and lost their language as they intermarried with other native California ethnic groups and learned the Spanish language.

The Bay Miwok were not recognized by modern anthropologists or linguists until the mid-twentieth century. In fact, Alfred L. Kroeber, father of California anthropology, who knew of one of their constituent local groups, the Saklan (Saclan), from nineteenth-century manuscript sources, presumed that they spoke an Ohlone ( Costanoan) language.

In 1955 linguist Madison Beeler recognized an 1821 vocabulary taken from a Saclan man at Mission San Francisco as representative of a Miwok language. The language was named &quot;Bay Miwok&quot; and its territorial extent was rediscovered during the 1960s (see &quot;Landholding Groups or Local Tribes&quot; section below).

==Culture==
The Bay Miwok lived by hunting and gathering, and lived in small bands without centralized political authority. They spoke &quot;Bay Miwok&quot; also known as &quot;Saclan&quot;. They were skilled at basketry.

===Religion===

The original Bay Miwok people&#x27;s world view was a form of Shamanism. As they were centrally located along an arc of Miwok-speaking groups across Central California, the Bay Miwok probably shared the Kuksu religion ceremonial motifs common to both the Coast Miwok to the west and Plains Miwok to the east. The Kuksu religion (dubbed the &quot;Kuksu Cult&quot; by early historians) included a cycle of elaborate dancing ceremonies, each with its own group of actors and distinctive feather-decorated regalia, an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms, puberty rites of passage, shamanic intervention with the spirit world, and, in some areas, an annual mourning ceremony. Varying forms of the Kuksu Cult were shared with other indigenous ethnic groups of Central California, such as their neighbors the northern Ohlone, Maidu, Patwin, Pomo, and Wappo. However Kroeber observed less &quot;specialized cosmogony&quot; in the Miwok, which he termed one of the &quot;southern Kuksu-dancing groups&quot;, in comparison to the Maidu and other northern California tribes.

===Traditional narratives and mythology===
The specific myths, legends, tales, and histories of the Bay Miwok are not well documented. C. Hart Merriam published a creation story, &quot;The Birth of Wek-Wek and the Creation of Man&quot;, centered on Mt. Diablo, that was told by a &quot;Hool-poom&#x27;-ne&quot; Miwok, perhaps a descendant of the Julpun Bay Miwok of Marsh Creek, eastern Contra Costa County.

One might suspect that the full corpus of Bay Miwok mythology and sacred narrative shared the motifs that the linguistically related and better-documented ethnographic Coast Miwok and Sierra Miwok held in common. All Miwok peoples believed in animal and human spirits, and saw the animal spirits as their ancestors. Coyote was seen as the representation of their creator god. The Sierra and Plains Miwok, as well as the Bay Miwok, believed this world began at Mount Diablo, following a flood.

==Landholding groups or local tribes==
The names and general territorial areas of seven Bay Miwok-speaking land-holding groups have been inferred through indirect methods, based for the most part on information in the ecclesiastical records of missions San Francisco and San Jose. In a 1961 Ph.D. dissertation, James Bennyhoff used data from the Alphonse Pinart transcripts of the mission records to identify four more East Bay local territorial groups, in addition to the Saclan, as members of this unique Miwok language group. &quot;The major clues to the linguistic affiliation of these river mouth tribelets are provided by the personal names of female neophytes recorded in the baptismal registers ... Ompin, Chupcan, Julpun, and Wolwon [Volvon-ed.] are linked together by the use of a distinctive constellation of endings which appear in female personal names,&quot; he wrote. Milliken subsequently used the same technique, applied to the original mission records, to identify two additional local tribes—Jalquin and Tatcan—as Bay Miwok speakers. Milliken then inferred and mapped the relative locations of all seven groups, using clues from historic diaries together with mission register information regarding intermarriage patterns among East Bay local tribes. The locations of the seven Bay Miwok local tribes are generally as follows:

* &quot;At and surrounding present-day City of Concord:&quot; Chupcan.
* &quot;At Mt. Diablo, surrounding present-day City of Clayton and east along Marsh Creek to Brentwood:&quot; Volvon (also spelled Wolwon, and Bolbon).
* &quot;Along lower Marsh Creek (east of Antioch):&quot; Julpun.
* &quot;At present-day City of Pittsburg and north to rural south Solano County:&quot; Ompin .
* &quot;At and surrounding present-day cities of Lafayette and Walnut Creek:&quot; Saclan.
* &quot;At and surrounding present-day City of Danville, on San Ramon Creek:&quot; Tatcan.
* &quot;In south portion of present-day City of Oakland, in present City of San Leandro, and on San Leandro Creek to the east:&quot; Jalquin.

Another group, the Yrgin of present-day City of Hayward and Castro Valley, had Chochenyo Ohlone signature female name endings, rather than Bay Miwok name endings. Yet they were so highly intermarried with the Jalquin that it seems possible that they and the Jalquin formed a single bilingual local tribe.

==History==
Documentation of Miwok peoples dates back as early as 1579 by a priest on a ship under the command of Francis Drake. Identification and references to the Bay Miwok tribes exists from California Mission records as early as 1794.

Spanish-American Franciscans set up Catholic missions in the Bay Area in the 1770s, but did not reach the Bay Miwok territory until 1794. Beginning in 1794, the Bay Miwoks were forced to migrate to the Franciscan missions, most to Mission San Francisco de Asís (of San Francisco), but some others to Mission San José (in present-day Fremont). All but the Ompin and Julpun in the northeast were at the missions by the end of 1806; the latter two groups moved to Mission San José during the 1810-1812 period. The first baptisms and emigration to the missions of each tribe were:
*In 1794-1795, 143 Saclans were baptized at the San Francisco Mission (25 more in later years).
*In 1799-1805, 152 Yrgins were baptized at the San Jose Mission.
*In 1801-1803, 77 Jalquins were baptized at the San Francisco Mission.
*In 1804, 127 Tatcans were baptized at San Francisco Mission.
*In 1805, 44 Volvons were baptized at the San Jose Mission; another 54 were baptized at Mission San Francisco over 1805-1806.
*In 1810, 146 Chupcans were baptized at the San Francisco Mission.
*In 1811, 103 Julpuns were baptized at the San Jose Mission; others fled to the east and north, and continued to come in for baptism until as late as 1827.
*In 1811, 99 Ompins were baptized at the San Jose Mission; 15 more were baptized in 1812.

Missionary linguist Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta obtained the only extant Bay Miwok vocabulary during a visit to Mission San Francisco in 1821.

==Population change over time==
Estimates for the precontact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. &quot;(See Population of Native California.)&quot; Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Plains and Sierra Miwok (but excluding the Bay Miwok, about whom he was not aware) at 9,000. Sherburne Cook carried out a more specific analysis of contact-period population in Alameda and Contra Costa counties west of the San Joaquin Valley, without regard to the Ohlone-Bay Miwok language boundary; he suggested a total population of 2,248. Richard Levy estimated 19,500 people for all five Eastern Miwok groups as a whole (Bay, Plains, Northern Sierra, Central Sierra, and Southern Sierra) prior to Spanish contact, and 1,700 specifically for the Bay Miwok.

A total of 859 Bay Miwok speakers were baptized at the Franciscan missions (479 at Mission San Francisco and 380 at Mission San Jose), most between 1794 and 1812. By the end of 1823, only 52 of the Mission San Francisco Bay Miwoks were still alive, along with 11 of their Mission-born children. No comparable data are available for Mission San Jose that year, but by 1840 only 20 Bay Miwok people were alive there. Late nineteenth century survivors from both missions intermarried with people from other language groups. Descendants are alive today (see &quot;Present Day&quot; section below).

==Present day==
The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area states that it includes the descendants of various Bay Miwok and Ohlone groups, including the previously federally recognized Verona Band of Alameda County. The Bureau of Indian Affairs denied the tribe&#x27;s request for federal recognition in 2002, and other tribal groups have disputed their land claims.

==Notable Bay Miwok people==
* 1795 – &quot;Potroy&quot;, leader of a 1795 revolt and flight from Mission San Francisco by newly Christianized Saclans, he was arrested by Spanish soldiers in 1797, tried, and sentenced to three sets of whippings and one year in shackles at the San Francisco Presidio.
* 1801 – &quot;Liberato Culpecse&quot;, born Jalquin, baptized at the Mission San Francisco in 1801, one of the main ancestors of the present day Muwekma Tribal community.

<doc id="529422" wikidata="Q16463" url="?curid=529422" title="Lyceum">
<text>The lyceum is a category of educational institution defined within the education system of many countries, mainly in Europe. The definition varies among countries; usually it is a type of secondary school. Basic science and some introduction to specific professions are generally taught.

==History==
&quot;Lyceum&quot; is a Latin rendering of the Ancient Greek (), the name of a &quot;gymnasium&quot; in Classical Athens dedicated to Apollo Lyceus. This original lyceum is remembered as the location of the peripatetic school of Aristotle. Some countries derive the name for their modern schools from the Latin but use the Greek name for the ancient school: for example, Dutch has (ancient) and (modern), both rendered &quot;lyceum&quot; in English (note that in classical Latin the &quot;C&quot; in was always pronounced as a &quot;K&quot;, not a soft &quot;C&quot;, as in modern English).

The name &quot;lycée&quot; was retrieved and utilized by Napoleon in 1802 to name the main secondary education establishments. From France the name spread in many countries influenced by French culture.

==By country==
===Asia===
====India====
The Goa Lyceum () in Panaji, Goa – established in 1854, following the Portuguese model – was the first public secondary school in the state, then a Portuguese territory. Later, the Goa Lyceum received the official title of (Afonso de Albuquerque National Lyceum). The Christ University Lyceum in Bengaluru, Karnataka - established in 2021, where scholars sit and do their research work and have discussion.

====Philippines====
The Philippines follows its version of the K-12 system, where the term &quot;junior high school&quot; might be used instead of &quot;lyceum&quot;. However, there are schools that appropriate the word &quot;lyceum&quot; in their name. The Lyceum of the Philippines University (LPU) is a university in Manila established by former wartime president José P. Laurel. Among its notable alumni are former president Rodrigo Duterte, popular author Rene Villanueva, and actor Cesar Montano. LPU has campuses in Makati, Batangas, Laguna, Cavite, and Davao.

The Filipino word for lyceum is from Spanish which can be found in some names of various universities and educational institutions which are unaffiliated with LPU.

====Uzbekistan and Tajikistan====
Lyceums also emerged in the former Soviet Union countries after they became independent. One typical example is Uzbekistan, where all high schools were replaced with lyceums ( is the Russian term, derived from French ), offering a three-year educational program with a certain major in a certain direction. Unlike Turkey, Uzbek lyceums do not hold university entrance examinations, which gives students the right to enter a university, but they hold a kind of mock examination which is designed to test their eligibility for a certain university.

===Europe===
====Albania====
The Albanian National Lyceum was a high school in the city of Korçë, Albania, that emphasized French culture and European values. The school fully functioned with a French cultural emphasis from 1917 to 1939. The school was continued post World War II as the Raqi Qirinxhi High School.

====Belarus====
The Belarusian Humanities Lyceum is a private secondary school founded shortly after Belarus&#x27; independence from the USSR by intellectuals, such as Vincuk Viacorka and Uladzimir Kolas, with the stated aims of preserving and promoting native Belarusian culture, and raising a new Belarusian elite. It was shut down in 2003 by the Ministry of Education of Belarus allegedly for promoting enmity within Belarusian society and using the classroom as a political soapbox, indoctrinating students with biased views on history, ideology, politics, morality and values. The lyceum eventually switched to homeschooling with a limited number of underground homeschoolers.

====Czech Republic====
The term &quot;lyceum&quot; refers to a type of secondary education consisting of anywhere from four years ended by graduation. It is a type of schooling between grammar school and a technical high school. For example, the famous scientist Gerty Cori went to a lyceum school.

====Finland====

The concept and name (in Swedish, in Finnish) entered Finland through Sweden. Traditionally, were schools to prepare students to enter universities, as opposed to the typical, more general education. Some old schools continue to use the name &quot;lyceum&quot;, though their operations today vary. For example, Helsinki Normal Lyceum educates students in grades 7–12, while Oulu Lyceum enrolls students only in grades 10–12. The more commonly used term for upper secondary school in Finland is in Finnish and in Swedish.

====France====
The French word for an upper secondary school, , derives from Lyceum. (see Secondary education in France.)

====Germany====

The lyceum in Germany was known as an old term for a Gymnasium for girls. In Bavaria it was also a Hochschule to study theology and philosophy.

* &quot;Liceo scientifico&quot; (scientific lyceum) focuses on maths, physics, biology and chemistry.
* &quot;Liceo linguistico&quot; (linguistic lyceum) focuses almost entirely on a certain number of languages and their literatures. Each school can decide which language to teach, but Italian and English are always present.
* &quot;Liceo artistico&quot; (arts lyceum) focuses on arts history and practical arts (varying from drawing to painting to sculpturing).

In 1989, during the Latvian National Awakening, the Pushkin Lyceum of Riga () with education programs in Russian was established. 
In 2002, another Russian lyceum was established in Daugavpils (), renamed to Daugavpils High School of Technologies () in 2020.

====Lithuania====
Some gymnasiums are called , e.g. Vilnius Lyceum.

====Malta====
Junior lyceums refer to secondary education state owned schools.

====Republic of Moldova====
Until recently, in the Republic of Moldova the lyceum – called – was an educational institution where students studied from the first to the twelfth grade and would obtain the baccalaureate degree upon completion. In most cases, the lyceums were specialized in a particular domain (fine art, theatre, language) that was relevant to the personality whose name the institution bore. In other respects, it was little different from any regular school, with the exception of slightly higher education standards and supposedly being more prestigious. 
After 2010, regular schools were all formally reformed into lyceums, although their quality remained of the same level as before and most did not get any particular specialization, thereby being dubbed &#x27;theory lyceums&#x27; (). One reason for the 2010 reform was to reduce the influence of the Soviet/Russian educational system and/or mentality in Moldova.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, a lyceum is a selective secondary school for children aged 12–18 that offers &quot;&quot;voorbereidend wetenschappelijk onderwijs&quot; (vwo) and &quot;hoger algemeen voortgezet onderwijs&quot;&quot; (havo), the top and high levels of secondary education available in that country. Successful completion allows vwo students admission to university and havo students to hogeschool, comparable to vocational university. The term &quot;lyceum&quot; is also sometimes used for other vocational schools such as the Grafisch Lyceum, or &quot;Muzieklyceum Amsterdam&quot;, which grew into the Conservatorium van Amsterdam.

====Poland====

The is the Polish secondary-education school. Polish liceums are attended by students aged 15 to 19–20 (see list below). Before graduating, pupils are subject to a final examination, the &quot;matura&quot;.

Polish liceums are of several types:
*general lyceum (15–19)
*specialised lyceum (15–19)
* complementary lyceum (17-20) 

====Portugal====
From 1836 until 1978, in the Portuguese educational system, the lyceum (), or national lyceum (), was a high school that prepared students to enter universities or more general education. On the other hand, the technical school () was a technical-oriented school.

After several education reforms, all these schools merged into a single system of &quot;3rd cycle basic&quot; and secondary schools (), offering grades 7 to 12.

====Romania====
The Romanian word for lyceum is . It represents a post-secondary form of education. In order for a student to graduate the lyceum and obtain a baccalaureate diploma, they must pass the &quot;bac&quot;. The lyceum consists of four school years (ages 15–19). Although the lyceum is a pre-university educational institution, it can be enough for the graduates to find a job, mainly in office work.

====Russia====
In Imperial Russia, a lyceum was one of the following higher educational facilities: Demidov Lyceum of Law in Yaroslavl (1803), Alexander Lyceum in Tsarskoye Selo (1810), Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa (1817), and Imperial Katkov Lyceum in Moscow (1867).

The Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum was opened on October 19, 1811, in the neoclassical building designed by Vasily Stasov and situated next to the Catherine Palace. The first graduates included Aleksandr Pushkin and Alexander Gorchakov. The opening date was celebrated each year with carousals and revels, and Pushkin composed new verses for each of those occasions. In January 1844 the Lyceum was moved to Saint Petersburg.

During 33 years of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum&#x27;s existence, there were 286 graduates. The most famous of these were Anton Delwig, Wilhelm Küchelbecher, Nicholas de Giers, Dmitry Tolstoy, Yakov Karlovich Grot, Nikolay Yakovlevich Danilevsky, Alexei Lobanov-Rostovsky and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin.

Since the 1990s there are lyceums (special secondary schools) with in-depth study of humanitarian or natural science disciplines. As a rule, university professors teach in lyceums, and the educational system resembles that of a university. Later, the lyceums were renamed special general secondary schools.

====Serbia====
The Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia was the first higher education school in Serbia in which education was taught in Serbian. It was founded in 1838 on the initiative of Prince Miloš Obrenović in 1838 in Kragujevac, then the capital of Serbia. When Belgrade became the Serbian capital in 1841, the Serbian Lyceum opened there. In 1863 it became known as the Grandes écoles until 1905 when it officially changed its name to the University of Belgrade.

====Turkey====
The Turkish word for the latest part of pre-university education is which is derived from the French word and corresponds to &quot;high school&quot; in English. It lasts four to five years with respect to the type of the high school. At the end of their education, students take the TYT/AYT test, i.e. university entrance examination, to get the right to enroll in a public university or a private university.

====Ukraine====
According to the Law of Ukraine &quot;On Education&quot;, the lyceum is a level III secondary institution of education (or a structural unit of another institution of education) that provides field-specific secondary education. As it is planned, since 2017 a three-year senior school will be a lyceum of academic or vocational training. In vocational school, a student will master their first profession, whereas in an academic lyceum they will deepen personal knowledge of specific subjects that will be studied further at a higher education establishment. Graduates of academic lyceums will be able to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree in three years (in most specialties) instead of four.

Other types of lyceums in Ukraine include military lyceums and lyceums with intensive military and physical training.

<doc id="529430" wikidata="Q696256" url="?curid=529430" title="Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact">
<text>The , also known as the , was a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan signed on April 13, 1941, two years after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Border War. The agreement meant that for most of World War II, the two nations fought against each other&#x27;s allies but not against each other. In 1945, late in the war, the Soviets scrapped the pact and joined the Allied campaign against Japan.

==Background==
After the Fall of France and then the expansion of the Axis Powers, the Soviet Union wished to mend its diplomatic relations in the Far East to safeguard its eastern border and to concentrate on the European Theatre of World War II. On the other hand, the Empire of Japan was bogged down in a seemingly-interminable war against China and had rapidly-deteriorating diplomatic relations with the United States. Those factors made the Japanese seek an accommodation with the Soviet Union to improve its international standing and to secure the northern border of Manchukuo from a possible Soviet invasion.

Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was initially unaware of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s briefing to his generals that an attack on the Soviet Union by the European Axis Powers would let Japan overtly challenge the United States. That briefing was based on the belief that if such an attack occurred, the Soviet Union would be too preoccupied with fighting Nazi Germany. That would make Japan feel less threatened by any possible Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and allow Japan to have enough provisions and capabilities to start a war against the United States. The pact would allow both Japan and the Soviet Union to avoid fighting on multiple fronts.

Stalin believed that his &quot;problems can be solved in a natural way if the Soviets and the Japanese cooperate&quot;. After concluding the nonaggression treaty, Stalin, in an unprecedented gesture, saw Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka off at the train station. That was symbolic of the importance that Stalin, who rarely appeared before foreign diplomats, attached to the treaty. It also provided him with the occasion, in the presence of the entire diplomatic corps, to invite negotiations with Germany and to flaunt his increased bargaining power.

==Signing==
The treaty was signed in Moscow on April 13, 1941, by Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka and Ambassador Yoshitsugu Tatekawa for Japan and Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov for the Soviet Union.

The same day, all three men also signed a declaration regarding Mongolia and Manchukuo. The Soviet Union pledged to respect the territorial integrity and the inviolability of Manchukuo, and Japan did the same for Mongolia.

==Effects==
Later in 1941, Japan, as a signatory of the Tripartite Pact, considered denouncing the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, especially after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, but it made the crucial decision to keep the pact and to expand southwards by instead invading the European colonies in Southeast Asia. That had a direct bearing on the Battle of Moscow since the absence of a Japanese threat allowed the Soviets to move large forces from Siberia and to send them to the front against the Germans. 

It is possible that if the Germans had won the Battle of Stalingrad, Japan would have invaded Siberia. General Tomoyuki Yamashita, who was known for his achievements in the Battle of Singapore, was sent to Manchuria in July 1942 and tasked with organizing troops for the invasion.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Stalin secretly agreed to enter the war against Japan in exchange for American and British recognition of certain Soviet territorial claims in Asia. The Soviet offensive was to start within three months after the end of the war in Europe.

==Soviet denunciation==
On April 5, 1945, the Soviet Union denounced the pact with Japan by informing the Japanese government that &quot;in accordance with Article Three of the above mentioned pact, which envisaged the right of denunciation one year before the lapse of the five-year period of operation of the pact, the Soviet Government hereby makes known to the Government of Japan its wish to denounce the pact of April 13, 1941.&quot; The wording of the denunciation suggested that the Soviet Union wished to see the treaty go out of effect immediately, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that the Soviet Foreign Commissar&#x27;s tone indicated that the Soviet Union might soon go to war against Japan.

The text of the treaty had stated that the pact remained &quot;valid for five years&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, until April 13, 1946). When Japanese Ambassador Naotake Sato pressed him, Molotov assured him that the treaty would remain in force until April 1946. The treaty also stated, &quot;In case neither of the Contracting Parties denounces the Pact one year before the expiration of the term, it will be considered automatically prolonged for the next five years&quot; (April 13, 1946 - April 13, 1951). The denunciation came on April 5, 1945, which under those terms meant that the treaty would not renew on April 13, 1946.

On May 8 or 9, 1945, the date depending on the time zone, Nazi Germany surrendered, which ended the war in Europe and started the secret three-month countdown for the Soviets to start hostilities against Japan. On August 9, 1945, just after midnight in Manchuria, the Soviets invaded Manchuria. The declaration of war against Japan followed nearly six hours later. Because of the time zone difference of 7 hours, the declaration of war could be still dated August 8, 1945, and was presented to the Japanese ambassador in Moscow at 11 p.m. Moscow time.

During the Soviet invasion, Japanese forces on the Asian mainland were unprepared to resist and were overrun relatively quickly. In the last campaign of the war, Soviet territorial gains in Asia were Manchukuo, Mengjiang (Inner Mongolia) and northern Korea.

<text>William Sutcliffe (born 9 March 1971) is a British novelist. He has written many acclaimed novels, spanning genres from satire to YA fiction. His 2008 book &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; has been adapted into a 2019 film by Netflix, under the title &quot;Otherhood&quot;.

==Novels==

Sutcliffe&#x27;s novels could be categorised as humorous. &quot;New Boy&quot; has much authentic material in it that refers to actual incidents from his life at Haberdashers&#x27;, although it would be going too far to call it &quot;autobiographical&quot;.

His next novel concerns a 10-year-old growing up in a North London suburb with his family, and the plot centres on the complex knot of his childhood friendships. Sutcliffe&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; (2008) is about interfering mothers of men who refuse to grow up. This has recently been adapted into a film by Netflix, under the new title &quot;Otherhood&quot;. His first young adult novel, &quot; The Wall&quot; (2013), tells of a boy in Israel&#x27;s Occupied Territories whose discovery of a tunnel underneath the barrier wall sets off a spiralling chain of events after he goes under and is saved from his attackers by a girl on the other side. Following on from the success of his first YA novel, Sutcliffe wrote his second, &quot;Concentr8&quot;, in (2015).

In 2009, he donated the short story &quot;Sandcastles: A Negotiation&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s &#x27;Ox-Tales&#x27; project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Sutcliffe&#x27;s story was published in the &#x27;Fire&#x27; collection.

More recently, Sutcliffe has been writing more humorous books for a younger audience, with his &quot;Circus of Thieves&quot; trilogy. He has also written a humorous novel for teenagers, &quot;The Gifted, the Talented and Me&quot;. The book had an extremely good reception, gaining positive reviews in many newspapers.

==Personal life==
Sutcliffe was born in 1971, in London. He was educated at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s School and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.
He later worked as a TV researcher before becoming a novelist. He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife the novelist Maggie O&#x27;Farrell, and their three children.

<doc id="529449" wikidata="Q3505275" url="?curid=529449" title="Audio control surface">
<text>In the domain of digital audio, a control surface is a human interface device (HID) that allows the user to control a digital audio workstation or other digital audio application. Generally, a control surface will contain one or more controls that can be assigned to parameters in the software, allowing tactile control of the software. As digital audio software is complex and can play any number of functions in the audio chain, control surfaces can be used to control many aspects of music production, including virtual instruments, samplers, signal processors, mixers, DJ software, and music sequencers.

A control surface is a physical interface, often resembling an analog Mixing console, used to manage your DAW (Digital audio workstation), plug-ins, and other audio software. There are many configurations of a control surfaces. They can contain a single fader like the Sparrow 3x100mm, to a large advanced console like the Avid S6. Control surfaces often features faders, knobs (rotary encoders), and buttons that can be assigned to parameters in the software. Other control surfaces are designed to give a musician control over the sequencer while recording, and thus provide transport controls (remote control of record, playback and song position). Control surfaces are often incorporated into MIDI controllers to give the musician more control over an instrument. Control surfaces with motorized faders can read and write mix automation.

The control surface connects to the host computer via many different interfaces. MIDI was the first major interface created for this purpose, although many devices now use USB, FireWire, or Ethernet.

== History ==
In the1950s the history of Mixing Control Surfaces began with the Altec Revocon remote mixing controller for sound reinforcement. It was the first type of equipment that allowed a sound engineer to control a backstage or booth mixer from anywhere in the audience or space that they were in with motorized controls on the mixer. Soon after in the 1960s, Fairchild introduced the Integra Control Surface mixers. These mixers were the first ones that incorporated channel strips that look like fader channels today. The Integra Control Surface controlled a rack mixer using LDR (light-dependent resistors) and reed relays. The next major development happened another decade later in the 1970s when motorized faders (flying Faders) were invented. This allowed for the integration of mix automation capabilities into consoles, allowing the position of the physical faders to correspond with automation data. A good example of this is if there needed to be a fade out. The automation data would tell the fader from its current position down to 0 over the specified time period. This technology was expensive at first, but the products improved through the 1980s allowing the cost to decrease and making them more commonplace.

Robert Moog introduced the first MIDI keyboards in 1982 which are control surfaces. Shortly after, Sequential Circuits released the Prophet 600 which was a keyboard with a MIDI interface as well as Roland releasing the MPU-401 which offered software that allowed the device to communicate directly with a PC. Both were released in 1983. 

== Types of Controls on Control Surfaces ==
Source:

=== Non-Motorized Faders ===
Traditional slider-style level controls. They work well in a live production environment, listening to others while creating music, and providing playback to DJs when looping. They are not recommended for mixing with DAWS due to the lack of data output. 

=== Motorized Faders ===
The faders are motorized for playback of a mix. They represent the physical position of a channel&#x27;s level at a specific position in a mix&#x27;s timeline. You can create new data by grabbing it during the mix and it will overwrite what is there. 

=== Buttons ===
Often will have an LED to indicate on or off. They can indicate channel mutes, solo sends, talkback, or perform navigation within a menu. 

=== Transport Controls ===
These are the buttons that look like a conventional tape. They allow you to play, stop, fast forward. 

=== Display/Meters ===
Mimics the meters on screen on the DAW&#x27;s computer display. It may show different settings, levels, routing, time code, and other information.

==Examples==
* Smart AV Tango - A hybrid controller with a 22&quot; touch screen, compatible with major DAWs for MAC &amp; PC.
* M-Audio ProjectMix - Control surface that can control many different applications.
* Mackie Control - Serves a similar purpose as the ProjectMix.

<text>Sturgeon Bay is a city in and the county seat of Door County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 9,646 at the 2020 census. Located at the bay of Sturgeon Bay for which it is named, it is the most-populous city on the Door Peninsula, a popular Upper Midwest vacation destination.

==History==
The area was originally inhabited by the Ho-Chunk and Menominee. The town is known in the Menominee language as &quot;Namāēw-Wīhkit&quot;, or &quot;bay of the sturgeon&quot;. The Menominee ceded this territory to the United States in the 1831 Treaty of Washington. After that, the area was available for white settlement.

The community was first recorded as Graham in 1855 but, in 1857, the state legislature organized it as the town of Ottumba. Subsequently, the name was reverted to Graham and, in 1860, a petition was submitted to the county board to change the community&#x27;s name to that of the adjacent bay. A company of volunteer firefighters was established in 1869. In 1874, Sturgeon Bay was incorporated as a village. It became a city in 1883, and the police department was founded that year. In 1891, Charles Mitchell Whiteside, a member of the Wisconsin Assembly, sponsored a bill that merged the community of Sawyer with Sturgeon Bay.

The city is locally known for the Sturgeon Bay Bridge at Michigan Street, which at the time of its 1931 opening was the second across the bay and carried the former route of WIS 17 (now WIS 42 and WIS 57/78).

Sturgeon Bay was one of a number of cities in the Midwest to assist with production during World War II. In 1943, many streets received new names. The former names of some streets are stenciled into older sidewalks.

<text>Ferns (, short for ) is a historic town in north County Wexford, Ireland. It is north of Enniscorthy. The remains of Ferns Castle are in the centre of the town. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

==History==
Ferns is believed to have been established in the 6th century, when a monastery was founded in 598 dedicated to St Mogue of Clonmore (St. Aidan), who was a Bishop of Ferns. The town became the capital of the Kingdom of Leinster, and also the Capital of Ireland when the kings of that southern part of the province established their seat of power there. It was a very large city, but shrank after a fire destroyed most of it. The city stretched all the way past the River Bann (tributary of the River Slaney), and it is speculated that had it not burned, it would be one of Ireland&#x27;s biggest cities today. King Dermot MacMurrough founded St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey as a house of Augustinian canons c. 1158 and was buried there in 1171.

Ferns Castle, an Anglo-Norman fortress, was built in the middle of the 13th century by William, Earl Marshall. In the time of Elizabeth I, it was granted to Sir Thomas Maisterson from Nantwich, Cheshire, who became a considerable force in the county. Today about half of the castle still stands. The town also contains the 13th-century St Edan&#x27;s Cathedral (Church of Ireland) This was a big aisled cathedral with a long chancel. The present east wall of the cathedral is the original east wall; the cathedral ran further to the west, towards the entrance to the cemetery. It has been suggested that the ruined building to the east, which has a row of fine Gothic windows, might have been built to house the effigy of Bishop John St John, now on the porch of the church. The Tower and the Chapter House were added on in the 19th century. The cemetery has several high crosses and parts of crosses.

The 19th-century population peaked in 1851, but never reached the levels of medieval times. Lewis&#x27;s Topography of 1834 claimed the town &quot;consists chiefly of one irregular street, and contains 106 houses indifferently built, retaining no trace of its ancient importance&quot;. The Abbey, St.Peter&#x27;s Church (Catholic and Anglican), and the remainder of the great cathedral are regarded as historic, holy places, and are still regarded as churches. This includes the abbey, which has the title of an abbey church.

==Church of St. Aidan==

The old Catholic church stood in the north of the town until the 1970s, when it was decided to demolish the building. A convent, St. Aidan&#x27;s Monastery of Adoration, has stood in its place since 1990.

The foundation stone of the new Church of St. Aidan was laid on the Feast of St. Aidan, 31 January 1974. This new Roman Catholic church was completed in 1975. In 2007, the new church went under a major refurbishment, and during 2007 and 2008 the parish replaced the old slates with new composite-metal material. The interior was also refurbished and a few minor changes were made to the look of the building.

A plaque listing the names of parish priests, from 1644, is on the wall to the right of the altar, beside the organ. The pipe organ in St. Aidan&#x27;s Church dates from 1901. Its bellows were once inflated by hand, until modifications were made to it in the 1970s, one of which saw a new electric blower to inflate the bellows installed. The pipe organ was transferred from the old church to the new church and is still in use. Before being transferred, it was completely dismantled, reshaped and redesigned to fit into a much smaller space, in the new church.

The Bell, dating from 1911, was installed in the tower of St. Mogue&#x27;s Church, by Canon John Doyle. It was moved and now stands outside the new Catholic church today, and is rung on special occasions, such as the New Year&#x27;s midnight celebrations, Christmas, and Easter.

==Religion and heritage==
The town gave the name to the Diocese of Ferns (both Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland). The town&#x27;s religious traditions live on today through the recent establishment in Ferns of a hermitage.

Ferns has evidence of four distinct periods in Irish history. Archaeological digs have revealed habitations from the Bronze, Iron, early Christian and Norman eras.

Ferns boasts many ecclesiastical sites dating from the early Christian era through Norman and the Middle Ages. Heritage sites include:
:Ferns Castle (which has a visitor centre and houses the Ferns Tapestries)
:Cathedral Graveyard

:Monument to Father John Murphy (who was born near Ferns)
:St. Aidan&#x27;s Church (New Catholic Church)
:St. Aidan’s Monastery of Adoration (Convent on the old Catholic church site)

==Transport==

Ferns is on the Gorey to Enniscorthy R772 road at the intersection with the R745 (both are regional roads). The town has been bypassed by the M11 motorway linking Dublin to Wexford since 18 July 2019.

Regular (almost hourly) bus services link Ferns to Dublin and Rosslare are provided by a number of companies.
Ferns railway station opened on 16 November 1863, closed to passenger traffic on 30 March 1964 and to goods traffic on 3 November 1975, before finally closing altogether on 7 March 1977.

<text>In mathematics, a remarkable cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number.

A cardinal &quot;κ&quot; is called remarkable if for all regular cardinals &quot;θ&quot; &gt; &quot;κ&quot;, there exist &quot;π&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;λ&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;N&quot; and &quot;ρ&quot; such that

# &quot;π&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;H&quot;&quot;θ&quot; is an elementary embedding
# &quot;M&quot; is countable and transitive
# &quot;π&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) = &quot;κ&quot;
# &quot;σ&quot; : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;N&quot; is an elementary embedding with critical point &quot;λ&quot;
# &quot;N&quot; is countable and transitive
# &quot;ρ&quot; = &quot;M&quot; ∩ [[Ordinal number|Ord]] is a regular cardinal in &quot;N&quot;
# &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;) &gt; &quot;ρ&quot;
# &quot;M&quot; = &quot;H&quot;&quot;ρ&quot;&quot;N&quot;, i.e., &quot;M&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; and &quot;N&quot; ⊨ &quot;M is the set of all sets that are hereditarily smaller than ρ&quot;

Equivalently, formula_1 is remarkable if and only if for every formula_2 there is formula_3 such that in some forcing extension formula_4, there is an elementary embedding formula_5 satisfying formula_6. Although the definition is similar to one of the definitions of supercompact cardinals, the elementary embedding here only has to exist in formula_4, not in formula_8.

<text>Ed &amp; Red&#x27;s Night Party (formerly called Ed&#x27;s Night Party and sometimes referred to simply as Ed the Sock) is a Canadian talk variety show. It was hosted by Steven Joel Kerzner as Ed the Sock and Kerzner&#x27;s real-life wife Liana K. Other people who worked on the show included DJ James Stamos and comedian Ron Sparks. To date, it is the longest running Canadian late night talk show in history.

== History ==
Originally produced by Rogers Television in Toronto (the same television entity that developed &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot; in Ottawa), the series was syndicated across Canada in the early 1990s. Ed&#x27;s profile was raised even higher with a series of specials and appearances on the national music video channel MuchMusic. The series was taken off the air in Alberta and other parts of the country after the show aired a comedy sequence in which Ed is shown supposedly having sex with a Playboy playmate, even though the program was being broadcast in a late night time slot.

In addition to its record-breaking run in Canada, the show briefly ran on G4 in the United States as part of their &quot;Midnight Spank&quot; late night television programming block. The show was also carried on the Ripe TV on-demand service. The show was retired with its final episode airing on CITY-TV on August 31, 2008. In Australia the show is seen on Fuel TV, where it is known as &quot;Ed the Sock&quot;.

== Legacy ==
After the shows cancellation, both Ed the Sock, Liana Kerzner, and Ron Sparks would later return together on a different show produced by CHCH-TV Hamilton called &quot;This Movie Sucks!&quot;, where the three pick on bad movies.

<doc id="529476" wikidata="Q32089" url="?curid=529476" title="Sirolimus">
<text>Sirolimus, also known as rapamycin and sold under the brand name Rapamune among others, is a macrolide compound that is used to coat coronary stents, prevent organ transplant rejection, treat a rare lung disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa). It has immunosuppressant functions in humans and is especially useful in preventing the rejection of kidney transplants. It is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase inhibitor that reduces the sensitivity of T cells and B cells to interleukin-2 (IL-2), inhibiting their activity.

This compound also has a use in cardiovascular drug-eluting stent technologies to inhibit restenosis.

It is produced by the bacterium &quot;Streptomyces hygroscopicus&quot; and was isolated for the first time in 1972, from samples of &quot;Streptomyces hygroscopicus&quot; found on Easter Island. The compound was originally named rapamycin after the native name of the island, Rapa Nui. Sirolimus was initially developed as an antifungal agent. However, this use was abandoned when it was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties due to its ability to inhibit mTOR. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1999. Hyftor (sirolimus gel) was approved for topical treatment of facial angiofibroma in the European Union in May 2023.

==Medical uses==
Sirolimus is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection and for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).

Sirolimus (Fyarro), as protein-bound particles, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa).

In the EU, sirolimus, as Rapamune, is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in adults at low to moderate immunological risk receiving a renal transplant and, as Hyftor, is indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.

===Prevention of transplant rejection===
The chief advantage sirolimus has over calcineurin inhibitors is its low toxicity toward kidneys. Transplant patients maintained on calcineurin inhibitors long-term tend to develop impaired kidney function or even kidney failure; this can be avoided by using sirolimus instead. It is particularly advantageous in patients with kidney transplants for hemolytic-uremic syndrome, as this disease is likely to recur in the transplanted kidney if a calcineurin-inhibitor is used. However, on 7 October 2008, the FDA approved safety labeling revisions for sirolimus to warn of the risk for decreased renal function associated with its use. In 2009, the FDA notified healthcare professionals that a clinical trial conducted by Wyeth showed an increased mortality in stable liver transplant patients after switching from a calcineurin inhibitor-based immunosuppressive regimen to sirolimus. A 2019 cohort study of nearly 10,000 lung transplant recipients in the US demonstrated significantly improved long-term survival using sirolimus + tacrolimus instead of mycophenolate mofetil + tacrolimus for immunosuppressive therapy starting at one year after transplant.

Sirolimus can also be used alone, or in conjunction with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as tacrolimus), and/or mycophenolate mofetil, to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.

===Lymphangioleiomyomatosis===
In May 2015, the FDA approved sirolimus to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare, progressive lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. This made sirolimus the first drug approved to treat this disease. LAM involves lung tissue infiltration with smooth muscle-like cells with mutations of the tuberous sclerosis complex gene (TSC2). Loss of TSC2 gene function activates the mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in the release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus blocks this pathway.

The safety and efficacy of sirolimus treatment of LAM were investigated in clinical trials that compared sirolimus treatment with a placebo group in 89 patients for 12 months. The patients were observed for 12 months after the treatment had ended. The most commonly reported side effects of sirolimus treatment of LAM were mouth and lip ulcers, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, sore throat, acne, chest pain, leg swelling, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dizziness, muscle pain and elevated cholesterol. Serious side effects including hypersensitivity and swelling (edema) have been observed in renal transplant patients.

While sirolimus was considered for treatment of LAM, it received orphan drug designation status because LAM is a rare condition.

The safety of LAM treatment by sirolimus in people younger than 18 years old has not been tested.

===Coronary stent coating===
The antiproliferative effect of sirolimus has also been used in conjunction with coronary stents to prevent restenosis in coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty. The sirolimus is formulated in a polymer coating that affords controlled release through the healing period following coronary intervention. Several large clinical studies have demonstrated lower restenosis rates in patients treated with sirolimus-eluting stents when compared to bare-metal stents, resulting in fewer repeat procedures. A sirolimus-eluting coronary stent was marketed by Cordis, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, under the tradename Cypher. However, this kind of stent may also increase the risk of vascular thrombosis.

===Vascular malformations===
Sirolimus is used to treat vascular malformations. Treatment with sirolimus can decrease pain and the fullness of vascular malformations, improve coagulation levels, and slow the growth of abnormal lymphatic vessels. Sirolimus is a relatively new medical therapy for the treatment of vascular malformations in recent years, sirolimus has emerged as a new medical treatment option for both vascular tumors and vascular malformations, as a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), capable of integrating signals from the PI3K/AKT pathway to coordinate proper cell growth and proliferation. Hence, sirolimus is ideal for &quot;proliferative&quot; vascular tumors through the control of tissue overgrowth disorders caused by inappropriate activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as an antiproliferative agent.

===Angiofibromas===
Sirolimus has been used as a topical treatment of angiofibromas with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Facial angiofibromas occur in 80% of patients with TSC, and the condition is very disfiguring. A retrospective review of English-language medical publications reporting on topical sirolimus treatment of facial angiofibromas found sixteen separate studies with positive patient outcomes after using the drug. The reports involved a total of 84 patients, and improvement was observed in 94% of subjects, especially if treatment began during the early stages of the disease. Sirolimus treatment was applied in several different formulations (ointment, gel, solution, and cream), ranging from 0.003 to 1% concentrations. Reported adverse effects included one case of perioral dermatitis, one case of cephalea, and four cases of irritation.

In April 2022, sirolimus was approved by the FDA for treating angiofibromas.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse reactions (≥30% occurrence, leading to a 5% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies of organ rejection prophylaxis in individuals with kidney transplants include: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, pain, constipation, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, increased creatinine, fever, urinary tract infection, anemia, arthralgia, and thrombocytopenia.

The most common adverse reactions (≥20% occurrence, leading to an 11% treatment discontinuation rate) observed with sirolimus in clinical studies for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are: peripheral edema, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal pain, headache, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, stomatitis, nasopharyngitis, acne, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness, and myalgia.

The following adverse effects occurred in 3–20% of individuals taking sirolimus for organ rejection prophylaxis following a kidney transplant:
===Diabetes-like symptoms===
While sirolimus inhibition of mTORC1 appears to mediate the drug&#x27;s benefits, it also inhibits mTORC2, which results in diabetes-like symptoms. This includes decreased glucose tolerance and insensitivity to insulin. Sirolimus treatment may additionally increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In mouse studies, these symptoms can be avoided through the use of alternate dosing regimens or analogs such as everolimus or temsirolimus.

===Lung toxicity===
Lung toxicity is a serious complication associated with sirolimus therapy, especially in the case of lung transplants. The mechanism of the interstitial pneumonitis caused by sirolimus and other macrolide MTOR inhibitors is unclear, and may have nothing to do with the mTOR pathway. The interstitial pneumonitis is not dose-dependent, but is more common in patients with underlying lung disease.

===Lowered effectiveness of immune system===
There have been warnings about the use of sirolimus in transplants, where it may increase mortality due to an increased risk of infections.

===Cancer risk===
Sirolimus may increase an individual&#x27;s risk for contracting skin cancers from exposure to sunlight or UV radiation, and risk of developing lymphoma. In studies, the skin cancer risk under sirolimus was lower than under other immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and calcineurin inhibitors, and lower than under placebo.

===Impaired wound healing===
Individuals taking sirolimus are at increased risk of experiencing impaired or delayed wound healing, particularly if they have a body mass index in excess of 30 kg/m2 (classified as obese).

== Interactions ==
Sirolimus is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme and is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump; hence, inhibitors of either protein may increase sirolimus concentrations in blood plasma, whereas inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations in blood plasma.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

Unlike the similarly named tacrolimus, sirolimus is not a calcineurin inhibitor, but it has a similar suppressive effect on the immune system. Sirolimus inhibits IL-2 and other cytokine receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Ciclosporin and tacrolimus inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting calcineurin.

The mode of action of sirolimus is to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) in a manner similar to tacrolimus. Unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex, which inhibits calcineurin (PP2B), the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin, rapamycin being another name for sirolimus) pathway by directly binding to mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).

mTOR has also been called FRAP (FKBP-rapamycin-associated protein), RAFT (rapamycin and FKBP target), RAPT1, or SEP. The earlier names FRAP and RAFT were coined to reflect the fact that sirolimus must bind FKBP12 first, and only the FKBP12-sirolimus complex can bind mTOR. However, mTOR is now the widely accepted name, since Tor was first discovered via genetic and molecular studies of sirolimus-resistant mutants of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; that identified FKBP12, Tor1, and Tor2 as the targets of sirolimus and provided robust support that the FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits Tor1 and Tor2.

===Pharmacokinetics===

Sirolimus is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme and is a substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump. It has linear pharmacokinetics. In studies on N=6 and N=36 subjects, peak concentration was obtained in 1.3 hours +/r- 0.5 hours and the terminal elimination was slow, with a half life around 60 hours +/- 10 hours. Sirolimus was not found to effect the concentration of ciclosporin, which is also metabolized primarily by the CYP3A4 enzyme.

The bioavailabiliy of sirolimus is low, and the absorption of sirolimus into the blood stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition. This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both sirolimus (SRL) and tacrolimus (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both.

==Chemistry==

Sirolimus is a natural product and macrocyclic lactone.

===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthesis of the rapamycin core is accomplished by a type I polyketide synthase (PKS) in conjunction with a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The domains responsible for the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide of rapamycin are organized into three multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, which contain a total of 14 modules (figure 1). The three multienzymes are organized such that the first four modules of polyketide chain elongation are in RapA, the following six modules for continued elongation are in RapB, and the final four modules to complete the biosynthesis of the linear polyketide are in RapC. Then, the linear polyketide is modified by the NRPS, RapP, which attaches L-pipecolate to the terminal end of the polyketide, and then cyclizes the molecule, yielding the unbound product, prerapamycin.

The core macrocycle, prerapamycin (figure 2), is then modified (figure 3) by an additional five enzymes, which lead to the final product, rapamycin. First, the core macrocycle is modified by RapI, SAM-dependent O-methyltransferase (MTase), which O-methylates at C39. Next, a carbonyl is installed at C9 by RapJ, a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenases (P-450). Then, RapM, another MTase, O-methylates at C16. Finally, RapN, another P-450, installs a hydroxyl at C27 immediately followed by O-methylation by Rap Q, a distinct MTase, at C27 to yield rapamycin.

The biosynthetic genes responsible for rapamycin synthesis have been identified. As expected, three extremely large open reading frames (ORF&#x27;s) designated as &quot;rapA&quot;, &quot;rapB&quot;, and &quot;rapC&quot; encode for three extremely large and complex multienzymes, RapA, RapB, and RapC, respectively. The gene &quot;rapL&quot; has been established to code for a NAD+-dependent lysine cycloamidase, which converts L-lysine to L-pipecolic acid (figure 4) for incorporation at the end of the polyketide. The gene &quot;rapP&quot;, which is embedded between the PKS genes and translationally coupled to &quot;rapC&quot;, encodes for an additional enzyme, an NPRS responsible for incorporating L-pipecolic acid, chain termination and cyclization of prerapamycin. In addition, genes &quot;rapI&quot;, &quot;rapJ&quot;, &quot;rapM&quot;, &quot;rapN&quot;, &quot;rapO&quot;, and &quot;rapQ&quot; have been identified as coding for tailoring enzymes that modify the macrocyclic core to give rapamycin (figure 3). Finally, &quot;rapG&quot; and &quot;rapH&quot; have been identified to code for enzymes that have a positive regulatory role in the preparation of rapamycin through the control of rapamycin PKS gene expression.
Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle begins as the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which is derived from the shikimate pathway. Note that the cyclohexane ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.

==Research==
===Cancer===
The antiproliferative effects of sirolimus may have a role in treating cancer. When dosed appropriately, sirolimus can enhance the immune response to tumor targeting or otherwise promote tumor regression in clinical trials. Sirolimus seems to lower the cancer risk in some transplant patients.

Sirolimus was shown to inhibit the progression of dermal Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma in patients with renal transplants. Other mTOR inhibitors, such as temsirolimus (CCI-779) or everolimus (RAD001), are being tested for use in cancers such as glioblastoma multiforme and mantle cell lymphoma. However, these drugs have a higher rate of fatal adverse events in cancer patients than control drugs.

A combination therapy of doxorubicin and sirolimus has been shown to drive Akt-positive lymphomas into remission in mice. Akt signalling promotes cell survival in Akt-positive lymphomas and acts to prevent the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide. Sirolimus blocks Akt signalling and the cells lose their resistance to the chemotherapy. Bcl-2-positive lymphomas were completely resistant to the therapy; eIF4E-expressing lymphomas are not sensitive to sirolimus.

===Tuberous sclerosis complex===
Sirolimus also shows promise in treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a congenital disorder that predisposes those afflicted to benign tumor growth in the brain, heart, kidneys, skin, and other organs. After several studies conclusively linked mTOR inhibitors to remission in TSC tumors, specifically subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in children and angiomyolipomas in adults, many US doctors began prescribing sirolimus (Wyeth&#x27;s Rapamune) and everolimus (Novartis&#x27;s RAD001) to TSC patients off-label. Numerous clinical trials using both rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with TSC, are underway in the United States.

===Effects on longevity===
mTOR, specifically mTORC1, was first shown to be important in aging in 2003, in a study on worms; sirolimus was shown to inhibit and slow aging in worms, yeast, and flies, and then to improve the condition of mouse models of various diseases of aging. Sirolimus was first shown to extend lifespan in wild-type mice in a study published by NIH investigators in 2009; the studies have been replicated in mice of many different genetic backgrounds. A study published in 2020 found late-life sirolimus dosing schedules enhanced mouse lifespan in a sex-specific manner: limited rapamycin exposure enhanced male but not female lifespan, providing evidence for sex differences in sirolimus response. The results are further supported by the finding that genetically modified mice with impaired mTORC1 signalling live longer.

Sirolimus has potential for widespread use as a longevity-promoting drug, with evidence pointing to its ability to prevent age-associated decline of cognitive and physical health. In 2014, researchers at Novartis showed that a related compound, everolimus, increased elderly patients&#x27; immune response on an intermittent dose. This led to many in the anti-aging community self-experimenting with the compound. However, because of the different biochemical properties of sirolimus, the dosing is potentially very different from that of everolimus. Ultimately, due to known side-effects of sirolimus, as well as inadequate evidence for optimal dosing, it was concluded in 2016 that more research was required before sirolimus could be widely prescribed for this purpose. Two human studies on the effects of sirolimus (rapamycin) on longevity did not show statistically significant benefits. However, due to limitations in the studies, further research is needed to fully assess its potential in humans.

Sirolimus has complex effects on the immune system—while IL-12 goes up and IL-10 decreases, which suggests an immunostimulatory response, TNF and IL-6 are decreased, which suggests an immunosuppressive response. The duration of the inhibition and the exact extent to which mTORC1 and mTORC2 are inhibited play a role, but were not yet well understood according to a 2015 paper.

===Topical administration===
When applied as a topical preparation, researchers showed that rapamycin can regenerate collagen and reverse clinical signs of aging in elderly patients. The concentrations are far lower than those used to treat angiofibromas.

===SARS-CoV-2===
Rapamycin has been proposed as a treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 insofar as its immunosuppressive effects could prevent or reduce the cytokine storm seen in very serious cases of COVID-19. Moreover, inhibition of cell proliferation by rapamycin could reduce viral replication.

===Atherosclerosis===
Rapamycin can accelerate degradation of oxidized LDL cholesterol in endothelial cells, thereby lowering the risk of atherosclerosis. Oxidized LDL cholesterol is a major contributor to atherosclerosis.

===Lupus===
As of 2016, studies in cells, animals, and humans have suggested that mTOR activation as process underlying systemic lupus erythematosus and that inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin may be a disease-modifying treatment. As of 2016 rapamycin had been tested in small clinical trials in people with lupus.

===Lymphatic malformation (LM)===
Lymphatic malformation, lymphangioma or cystic hygroma, is an abnormal growth of lymphatic vessels that usually affects children around the head and neck area and more rarely involving the tongue causing macroglossia. LM is caused by a PIK3CA mutation during lymphangiogenesis early in gestational cell formation causing the malformation of lymphatic tissue. Treatment often consists of removal of the affected tissue via excision, laser ablation or sclerotherapy, but the rate of recurrence can be high and surgery can have complications. Sirolimus has shown evidence of being an effective treatment in alleviating symptoms and reducing the size of the malformation by way of altering the mTOR pathway in lymphangiogenesis. Although an off label use of the drug, Sirolimus has been shown to be an effective treatment for both microcystic and macrocystic LM. More research is however needed to develop and create targeted, effective treatment therapies for LM.

===Graft-versus-host disease===
Due to its immunosuppressant activity, Rapamycin has been assessed as prophylaxis or treatment agent of Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While contrasted results were obtained in clinical trials, pre-clinical studies have shown that Rapamycin can mitigate GVHD by increasing the proliferation of regulatory T cells, inhibiting cytotoxic T cells and lowering the differentiation of effector T cells.

===Applications in biology research===
Rapamycin is used in biology research as an agent for chemically induced dimerization. In this application, rapamycin is added to cells expressing two fusion constructs, one of which contains the rapamycin-binding FRB domain from mTOR and the other of which contains an FKBP domain. Each fusion protein also contains additional domains that are brought into proximity when rapamycin induces binding of FRB and FKBP. In this way, rapamycin can be used to control and study protein localization and interactions.

== Veterinary uses ==
A number of veterinary medicine teaching hospitals are participating in a long-term clinical study examining the effect of rapamycin on the longevity of dogs.

A current, ongoing, clinical trial lead by NC State College of Veterinary Medicine (HALT), run at a wide number of veterinary hospitals across the USA, has discovered rapamycin reverses the effects of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in cats. The drug is expected to receive FDA conditional approval sometime in March 2025. This will be the first drug ever to reverse the effects of HCM in cats which is universally fatal.

<text>The St. Marys River (named Saint Marys River by the United States Geological Survey,) is a river in the southeastern United States. The river was known to the Timucua as Thlathlothlaguphka, or Phlaphlagaphgaw, meaning &quot;rotten fish&quot;. French explorer Jean Ribault named the river the Seine when he encountered it in 1562. From near its source in the Okefenokee Swamp, to its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean, it forms a portion of the border between the U.S. states of Georgia and Florida. Part of the river runs along the southernmost point in the state of Georgia.

The St. Marys River rises as a tiny stream flowing from the western edge of Trail Ridge, the geological relic of a barrier island/dune system, and into the southeastern Okefenokee Swamp. Arching to the northwest, it loses its channel within the swamp, then turns back to the southwest and reforms a stream, at which point it becomes the St. Marys River. Joined by another stream, Moccasin Creek, the river emerges from the Okefenokee Swamp at Baxter, Florida/Moniac, Georgia. It then flows south, then east, then north, then east-southeast intersecting I-95 near Yulee, and finally emptying its waters into the Atlantic, near St. Marys, Georgia and Fernandina Beach, Florida.

==1805 incident==
On 6 July 1805, Lieutenant Robert Pigot of arrived off the harbour in the French privateer schooner &quot;Matilda&quot;, which the British had captured three days earlier. On 7 July Pigot took &quot;Matilda&quot; up the St Marys River to attack three vessels reported to be there. Along the way militia and riflemen fired on &quot;Matilda&quot;. Eventually the British reached the three vessels, which were lashed in a line across the river. They consisted of a Spanish privateer schooner and her two British prizes, the ship and the brig &quot;Ceres&quot;, which the Spanish privateer had captured some two months earlier. The Spaniards had armed &quot;Golden Grove&quot; with eight 6-pounder guns and six swivels, and given her a crew of 50 men. The brig too was armed with swivels and small arms. The Spanish schooner carried six guns and a crew of 70 men.

Pigot engaged the vessels for an hour, and then after &quot;Matilda&quot; had grounded, took his crew in her boats and captured &quot;Golden Grove&quot;. The British then captured the other two vessels. Lastly, Pigot fired on a group of 100 militia, with a field gun, dispersing them. The British had two men killed, and 14 wounded, including Pigot, who had received two bullet wounds to head and one to a leg. A crowd of Americans on the Georgia side of the river watched the entire battle.

<doc id="529502" wikidata="Q2473691" url="?curid=529502" title="Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)">
<text>Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) is the second solo studio album by English musician Brian Eno (mononymously credited as &quot;Eno&quot;), released in November 1974 by Island Records. Unlike his debut album &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, which featured 16 musicians, this album utilized a core band of five instrumentalists: Eno (keyboards, guitar), Phil Manzanera (guitar), Brian Turrington (bass guitar), Freddie Smith (drums), and Robert Wyatt (percussion). Manzanera also participated in the writing and production. To help guide the musicians, Eno and Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards called Oblique Strategies to facilitate creativity during the recording process.

&quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; is a loose concept album that references themes of geopolitical intrigue ranging from espionage to the Chinese Communist Revolution. It did not chart in the United Kingdom or the United States, but received positive reviews from critics. Since its release, the album has received even more critical attention.

== Production ==
The album was inspired by a series of postcards depicting a Chinese revolutionary opera titled &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy&quot;. Eno described his understanding of the title as referring to &quot;the dichotomy between the archaic and the progressive. Half Taking Tiger Mountain – that Middle Ages physical feel of storming a military position – and half (By Strategy) – that very, very 20th-century mental concept of a tactical interaction of systems.&quot;
To further explore the possibilities of the studio setting, Eno and his friend Peter Schmidt developed instruction cards, called Oblique Strategies. During the recording sessions, he would allow the cards to dictate the next unconsidered action in the recording process. Describing the words on the album as an expression of &quot;idiot glee&quot;, Eno and Schmidt eventually expanded the Oblique Strategies set to over 100 &quot;worthwhile dilemmas&quot;, which would be used in nearly all his future recordings and productions. Schmidt also designed the album cover, which consists of four prints from an edition of fifteen hundred of his unique lithographs, as well as Polaroids of Eno, credited on the album sleeve to Lorenz Zatecky.

Manzanera spoke positively about the recording experience. He described it as:

...just doing anything we felt like doing at the time. The engineer we used, Rhett Davies, also did &quot;Diamond Head&quot; and &quot;801 Live&quot; and Quiet Sun, so it was like family. There was a lot of experimenting and a lot of hours spent with Brian Eno, me, and Rhett in the control room doing all the things that eventually evolved into those cards, the Oblique Strategies, and it was just a lot of fun.

Eno&#x27;s group on &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; included Brian Turrington and Freddie Smith of The Winkies, along with Robert Wyatt and Manzanera. Other musicians appearing on the album include Andy Mackay of Roxy Music, along with the Portsmouth Sinfonia, an orchestra in which Eno had once played clarinet. (The Portsmouth Sinfonia allowed anybody to join as long as they had no experience with the instrument they would play in the orchestra.) Phil Collins plays drums on &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless&quot;. After Eno had helped with production on the Genesis album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, Genesis front man Peter Gabriel asked how the band could reciprocate, so Eno requested Collins play drums for him.

== Music and lyrics ==

The sound of &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; has been described as more subdued than Eno&#x27;s previous solo album, while the lyrics have darker themes and subject matter. The album&#x27;s lyrics have been described as &quot;remarkably literate and often humorous&quot; with &quot;quick-fire rhymes, oddball couplets, abrupt demands, and ruthless statements&quot;. To create the lyrics, Eno sang nonsense syllables to the record&#x27;s backing tracks and then turned them into words. This lyric-writing method was used for all his more vocal-based recordings of the 1970s.

References to China appear in the album&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Burning Airlines Give You So Much More,&quot; &quot;China My China,&quot; and &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic described the album&#x27;s themes as &quot;often inscrutable, but still playful – about espionage, the Chinese Communist revolution, and dream associations&quot;. On the political theme within the lyrics and album title, Eno explained that he is &quot;not Maoist or anything like that; if anything I&#x27;m anti-Maoist&quot;. The album addresses several different esoteric topics. &quot;Burning Airlines Give You So Much More&quot; is inspired by a 1974 crash near Paris of a Turkish Airlines DC-10, one of the worst air crashes in history. &quot;The Fat Lady of Limbourg&quot;, described by Eno as a &quot;Burroughs-type song&quot; about an asylum in Limbourg, Belgium, where the residents of it outnumber the population of the town. &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; describes the rape of a suburban housewife by a crazed machine.

== Release ==

&quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; was released in November 1974 in a gatefold sleeve. No singles were released from the album, and it failed to chart in either the United Kingdom or the United States.

The album was reissued by Virgin Records in remastered digipak form in 2004.

== Critical reception==
Like &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; received a mostly positive reception from critics. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the album a rating of A−. &quot;Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure&quot;, he said. &quot;Admittedly, when they&#x27;re over they&#x27;re over – you don&#x27;t flash on them the way you do on &#x27;Cindy Tells Me&#x27; and &#x27;Baby&#x27;s on Fire&#x27;. But that&#x27;s just his way of being modest.&quot; Wayne Robbins of &quot;Creem&quot; lauded Eno for the way he &quot;grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow&quot;. Robbins explained, &quot;It sounds like it might be pretentious; it&#x27;s not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions.&quot; He concluded that &quot;a man who can write songs like &#x27;Burning Airlines Give You So Much More&#x27; has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with&quot;. &quot;Circus&quot; magazine described the album as &quot;Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, it feels so good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the &#x27;Most Wanted&#x27; list by psychopaths everywhere [...] [Eno] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable&quot;. Critic Ed Naha, writing in &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, gave the album a negative review, writing &quot;Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno&#x27;s first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell.&quot; In 1975 &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; was voted one of the best albums of the year in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1975.

Recent assessments of the album have been mostly positive, with AllMusic and &quot;Blender&quot; giving the album 5 stars, their highest ratings. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey compared it to Eno&#x27;s first album, writing &quot;not quite as enthusiastic as &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; is made accessible through Eno&#x27;s mastery of pop song structure&quot;. Douglas Wolk of &quot;Blender&quot; rated it more highly than &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;, calling it &quot;more immediately likeable&quot;. &quot;Select&quot; gave the album a four-out-of-five rating, calling it &quot;excellent&quot;. He described the songs &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless,&quot; &quot;Put a Straw under Baby,&quot; and &quot;Third Uncle&quot; as highlights. Chris Jones of BBC Music called &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; &quot;a work of genius because it didn&#x27;t know the meaning of repetition&quot; and &quot;merely took &quot;Warm Jets&quot; and refined it into a smoother lump of oddness.&quot;

<text>The Great Seal of the Irish Free State () is either of two seals affixed to certain classes of official documents of the Irish Free State (&quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot;): 
* the &quot;&quot;internal&quot; Great Seal&quot;, used from 1925 for &quot;internal&quot; documents (of domestic law) signed by the Governor-General 
* the &quot;&quot;external&quot; Great Seal&quot;, used from 1932 for diplomatic documents signed by the British king. 
A new seal, for documents signed by the President of Ireland, replaced the internal seal in 1937, when the Constitution of Ireland came into force; it replaced the external seal in 1949 when the Republic of Ireland Act came into force.

==Internal Great Seal==
The Great Seal of Ireland was used in the English king&#x27;s Lordship of Ireland, which in 1534 became the Kingdom of Ireland. The seal was retained by the Acts of Union 1800 for use by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in the business of the Dublin Castle administration. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 retained the Lord Lieutenant and Great Seal for use by both Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty envisaged an Irish Free State to replace Southern Ireland, with a Provisional Government and Provisional Parliament until the Free State&#x27;s constitution was enacted. The draft constitution replaced the Lord Lieutenant with a Governor General but made no explicit mention of the seal.

In August 1922 the Provisional Government&#x27;s civil servants sought ministerial approval to adopt a seal. It was thought necessary for legal reasons: the treaty and draft constitution specified that the Irish Free State would have the same constitutional status as Canada, which had its own Great Seal since its Confederation in 1867. The letters patent issued on 6 December 1922 constituting the office of Governor-General said:
The wording matched the 1900 letters patent for the Great Seal of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 also created a separate Governor and Great Seal for Northern Ireland.

The physical seal was in theory in the custody of the Governor-General for his personal use; in practice the President of the Executive Council used it, and it was kept in his department even when authenticating the Governor-General&#x27;s signature.

===Design===
The Great Seal features an image of a Celtic harp surrounded by Celtic knotwork and the words &quot;SAORSTÁT ÉIREANN&quot; in Gaelic script. The die comprises an inscribed copper matrix to be placed over the document to be sealed, and a counterpart relief steel patrix to be placed under it. Whereas the British and former Irish great seals had two-sided moulds to create a solid seal to be attached to the document via a cord, the Free State seal was a single-sided stamp placed directly onto the leaf of the document.

Regarding the design of the Great Seal, an approach was made by Hugh Kennedy, the Attorney General, to Thomas Sadleir, Registrar of the Office of Arms at Dublin Castle. In his reply Sadlier noted that he was &quot;satisfied that the harp was very early in the 12th century an Irish badge...&quot;. The 1919–1922 seal of the revolutionary Dáil of the self-proclaimed Irish Republic showed a harp surrounded by the words &quot;Sigullum Reipublicae Hibernicae — Seala Saorstáit Éireann&quot;. By contrast, the 1922 Provisional Government&#x27;s seal was a quartering of the arms of the four provinces. The Provisional Government&#x27;s private secretary suggested to Hugh Kennedy a similar seal for the Free State: &quot;If considered desirable to symbolise in the design the present partition of Ulster, this could be done by leaving the Arms incomplete and broken at the corner.&quot;. George Sigerson, the President of the National Literary Society, recommended to Tim Healy, the new Governor-General, that the harp should be adopted as the symbol of the Free State. His view was that:

On 28 December 1922 a meeting of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State decided that the Celtic harp should be adopted. Mabel McConnell, from a family of heraldic artists, was contracted by the Executive Council to make the sketches which the Royal Mint in England used to cast the die matrix for the seal. The first design submitted placed an animal-head harp in a heraldic shield with crest, but the mint said this would be &quot;a disaster&quot;. On 28 August 1923 the Executive Council determined that the &quot;Brian Ború&quot; harp in Trinity College Dublin, would be the basis of the new seal. Archibald McGoogan of the Art Department of the National Museum of Ireland perfected the design, and the Royal Mint in January 1924 said it was &quot;delighted&quot; with the revised version.

Final authorisation was given by the Executive Council on 17 October 1924 for the provision of the various seals, including ministerial seals which had the Brian Ború harp circumscribed with &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot; and the ministerial title in Irish and English. The knotwork was a direct copy of the base of the Ardagh Chalice. McGoogan&#x27;s original drawing was sold at auction in 2007 for €17,000. Cecil Thomas engraved the seal manually with hammer and chisel because it was &quot;artistically dull&quot; and &quot;relied on sharp definition for its interest&quot;. It was in diameter.

===British legal objections===
A. S. Roberts, Director of Stamping at the Revenue Commissioners, had fulfilled the same role in the Dublin Castle administration prior to the Free State&#x27;s independence, and as such was used to dealing directly with the Royal Mint for ordering new revenue stamps. Using Roberts as the conduit for ordering the 1925 Great Seal meant the commission was fulfilled as an ordinary commercial contract. In 1926, the Colonial Office discovered the existence of the Free State&#x27;s new seal and complained to Robert Johnson, Deputy Master and Controller of the Royal Mint, that proper procedures had not been followed: the design ought to have been submitted for pre-approval by the King-in-Council: that is, submitted via the Colonial Office to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, which would advise the King to issue an Order in Council for formal approval.

==External Great Seal==

In 1931, a separate External Great Seal or Royal Great Seal was created to be used on diplomatic documents which required the signature of the monarch in London rather than the Governor-General in Dublin. Up to 1931, such documents had been transmitted to the Dominions Office and the British Great Seal of the Realm was applied alongside the signature. At the 1930 Imperial Conference, the Free State proposed that a Dominion should be allowed to send documents via its High Commissioner in London, bypassing the British government, and to affix its own seal rather than the British one. The conference subcommittee on seals resolved, &quot;The subject should be postponed on the understanding that the whole question should be left for further discussion between Governments should occasion arise&quot;. In January 1931 the Free State government tested its proposed procedure; it applied the 1925 Free State seal to the instrument of ratification for a 1929 treaty between the Free State and Portugal, and sent it to High Commissioner John W. Dulanty to transmit to King George V. Dulanty was refused an audience, the British objecting on the grounds that the change in procedure had not been agreed, and that the 1925 seal was not in fact a &quot;great seal&quot; within the terms of the 1922 letters patent, but merely a &quot;private seal of the Governor-General&quot;, since it had never been formally approved by the monarch. A compromise was negotiated whereby the Free State would use a separate &quot;external seal&quot; in the custody of its Minister for External Affairs. Although Arthur Berriedale Keith claimed in 1934 that &quot;this drastic change in Commonwealth relations was carried out without any discussion in the British Parliament or intimation by the British Government of the change&quot;, in fact Sir William Davison asked J. H. Thomas, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, about it in April 1931; Thomas referred to the Balfour Declaration of 1926.

The external seal, designed by Percy Metcalfe, had on its reverse a similar image to the 1925 &quot;internal&quot; seal: an Irish harp superimposed upon a Celtic knotwork Greek cross, encircled by the words &quot;SAORSTAT EIREANN&quot; in Gaelic type and further knotwork. Its diameter was , the same as the British Great Seal of the Realm, and had on its obverse the same image of the monarch enthroned as that seal, also designed by Metcalfe, except for the quartered royal arms above the throne, where the English arms in first and fourth quarters were switched with the Irish arms in third quarter. The proposal agreed by George V and the ensuing Department of External Affairs press release both said the new seal would be struck within the Free State. However, the matrix die was made at Royal Mint Court in London, both sides cut from a single piece of silver by applying a reducing machine to Metcalfe&#x27;s model.

George V formally presented the external seal to John W. Dulanty on 18 January 1932 at Sandringham House. Keith commented that this marked &quot;the final establishment of the complete international sovereignty of the Free State and the elimination of any British control&quot;. The External Great Seal was used only on ratifications and Full Powers, and not always on the latter. Smaller seals, also made by the Royal Mint in 1931, were used on lesser documents:
* The &quot;Signet Seal&quot; was used on exequaturs receiving foreign diplomats, and on commissions appointing Irish diplomats and, in 1932, the Governor General Domhnall Ua Buachalla. This seal was used to authenticate the king&#x27;s &quot;royal sign-manual&quot;, which was necessary on documents authorising the Dublin authorities to use the Great Seal. The Signet Seal was a stainless-steel replica of the Great Seal of diameter 
* The &quot;Fob Seal&quot; was a single-sided seal with the same modified quartered royal arms as the Great Seal. It was modelled on the pre-existing UK fob seal and used for the same purposes, on the back of the envelope enclosing letters of credence or recall.
Whereas the UK&#x27;s Crown Office Act 1877 permits a small wafer Great Seal to replace the cumbersome wax Great Seal, the Free State&#x27;s wax seal had no wafer equivalent.

The first use of the External Great Seal was not until 1937, when George VI sealed Full Powers allowing Francis T. Cremins to sign the Montreux Convention Regarding the Abolition of the Capitulations in Egypt on behalf of the Free State. Successive governments minimised the use of monarch and the External Great Seal. The state typically conducted bilateral agreements at inter-government level rather than the nominally more prestigious head-of-state level, so that the Minister for External Affairs would apply his departmental seal to any documents. After signing some multilateral treaties that would have required the External Great Seal for ratification, the state chose instead to wait until the treaty had come into force and then become a party to it by accession rather than ratification, as the internal Great Seal would suffice for accession.

After the Statute of Westminster 1931, following the Free State&#x27;s lead, the Union of South Africa in 1934 and Canada in 1939 passed laws permitting themselves to use their own Great Seals for diplomatic functions. South Africa, like the Free State, created a new seal for these purposes, whereas Canada simply extended the use of its existing domestic seal.

==Supersession==

The fact that the Free State was a monarchy rather than a republic was politically controversial, and caused the 1922–23 Irish Civil War. Although the republicans lost the war, Free State leaders sensitive to the controversy gradually abolished the Governor-General&#x27;s formal powers, or transferred them elsewhere. The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 created a separate Executive Council seal, similar to the Great Seal but with added to the inscription. When republican Civil War leader Éamon de Valera became President of the Executive Council after the 1932 Irish election, sidelining the Governor-General accelerated, until the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the office altogether and transferred its remaining functions to the Executive Council. Rather than using the internal Great Seal in connection with these functions, the Executive Council seal was used. In 1937 de Valera said &quot;I have no idea of what sort of seal that [the internal Great Seal] was. As well as I remember, I never saw a document sealed with it.&quot; The die of the internal Free State seal is now on public display at National Museum of Ireland – Decorative Arts and History in Dublin.

Ancillary to the abolition of the Governor-Generalship, the Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 continued the use of the External Great Seal by the King. The distinction between the two Great Seals was not always clearly understood. In 1932, Hugh Kennedy, by then Chief Justice, was under the impression that the internal and external seals were in the custody respectively of the Executive Council and Governor-General. The 1937 Constitution of Ireland created the office of President of Ireland, and the Seal of the President was created for the President&#x27;s formal signature of official documents in the same manner as the internal Free State seal had been used, and having the same design except substituting &quot;Éire&quot; for &quot;Saorstát Éireann&quot;, since the constitution had changed the name of the state. The text on the reverse of External Great Seal was changed likewise, and the British monarch, George VI, continued to sign diplomatic documents using it. This dichotomy reflected ambiguity over who was head of state. The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 transferred diplomatic functions to the President, rendering the External Great Seal obsolete.

<text>The vast majority of surviving Tibetan art created before the mid-20th century is religious, with the main forms being thangka, paintings on cloth, mostly in a technique described as gouache or distemper, Tibetan Buddhist wall paintings, and small statues in bronze, or large ones in clay, stucco or wood. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of Tibetan Buddhism and were manufactured in large workshops by monks and lay artists, who are mostly unknown. Various types of religious objects, such as the &quot;phurba&quot; or ritual dagger, are finely made and lavishly decorated. Secular objects, in particular jewellery and textiles, were also made, with Chinese influences strong in the latter.
Himalayan art is an overall term for Tibetan art together with the art of Bhutan, Nepal, Ladakh, Kashmir and neighbouring parts of Mongolia and China where Tibetan Buddhism is practiced. Sino-Tibetan art refers to works in a Tibetan style and with Tibetan Buddhist iconography produced in either China or Tibet, often arising from patronage by Chinese emperors. The artists seem to have been a mixture of Tibetan and Chinese, with some Newari from Nepal, and the place of manufacture is often uncertain between the two. The less common term of Tibeto-Chinese may be used when the Tibetan element is the stronger.
Tibetan religious art has been described as &quot;almost unbelievably conservative&quot;, to a large extent representing &quot;the perpetuation of the forms and iconography of the last phase of Buddhist art of India&quot;, ending about the 12th century. This was the Pala-Sena art of north-east India, relatively close to Tibet, and the home of key figures like Atisha, a missionary from Nalanda in Bihar. After the decline of Buddhism in India soon after, very little survives from the Indian Buddhist art of this or earlier periods except monumental sculpture, and art historians must deduce much about this vanished culture from Tibetan works. Other influences on Tibetan art over the centuries came from Chinese and Nepalese Buddhist art. Landscape backgrounds were adopted from Chinese painting from about the 14th century for some thanka, and Chinese ornamental styles became dominant around 1700.

The finest achievements are typically considered to be in painted thanka and small bronzes (often gilt-bronze), where the best works have very high levels of technical skill. These were generally private works, only seen within monasteries, and often specifically designed for meditation. More public art includes large statues for prayer halls, large appliqué thankas for temporary display during Tibetan festivals on thangka walls, and sand mandalas, also temporary.
==Artists==
Painters and at least the modellers of sculpture were mostly monks, but less so for those made in China, or by the many Nepali artists who worked in or for Tibet. Many applied arts were made by lay craftspeople, sometimes working to designs for ornament supplied by monks. Apart from works from recent decades the names of the artists involved are unknown, except in the case of a few leading artist monks, such as Chöying Dorje, 10th Karmapa (1604–1674), and the Mongolian Zanabazar (1635–1715).

There have recently been rather controversial attempts to attribute some surviving works to a well-documented and significant Nepali artist called Aniko or Anige (1245–1306), who worked in painting, sculpture and architecture in Tibet and China, but it remains uncertain if anything by him, rather than his sons or followers, has survived.

==Painting==

Paintings come in several types and sizes. The most important is the thangka, a broad term for portable paintings on cloth or paper that can be stored rolled-up. Larger ones may also be called &quot;banners&quot;, and the really large ones for display on thangka walls at festivals are mostly made from appliqué cloth, with only minimal painting. Even relatively small thangkas which are much taller than they are wide may be called banners.

The usual painting technique is gouache on fine cotton, but other cloth may be used. Painting was over an underdrawing. Colours were originally bright, though many old paintings have faded. Most, and all before the 16th century, are square or have a vertical &quot;portrait&quot; format, and most are under a metre tall. There are also images in silk tapestry using the Chinese &quot;kesi&quot; technique. The earliest thangka to survive are some from the blocked-up cave near Dunhuang that date from a period of Tibetan occupation there in the 10th century.
&quot;Tsakli&quot; or &quot;initiation cards&quot; are small painted (or sometimes printed) images on cloth, glued to a card backing, usually showing a relatively simple image of a sacred figure, or a pair. They were produced in sets of perhaps six to over a hundred, and used for instructing monks and also the temporary consecration and protection of sites or objects. The figure may be identified in ink on the back. They are one of a number of Tibetan forms without close comparators in neighbouring Buddhist countries.

Most monasteries and temples in Tibet had wall paintings, a large percentage of which have been destroyed or badly damaged. These were painted over several plaster-like layers of &quot;clay, chopped-up straw, and dung&quot; in the same technique as thangkas. They usually cover the entire wall above a certain level, using much the same subjects and styles as thangkas. Paintings and other works were ritually consecrated upon completion.

Book covers more often included painted decoration than the pages of the book. This is usually on the inside of the wood cover, so the painting is protected. Initially books had the very long, thin, shape of Indian palm leaf manuscripts whatever material was used, allowing only a long row of &quot;tsakli&quot;-like single figures. Later different shapes were used, allowing larger thangka-style compositions.

==Sculpture==
The most common material for smaller sculptures is metal, usually &quot;bronze&quot;, which is often gilded. Modern scientific analysis shows that the actual compositions of Tibetan &quot;bronze&quot; (or copper alloy) are even more variable than in bronze from other parts of the world, being very often brass and sometimes almost pure copper. The compositions sometimes vary considerably from one end of a statue to the other. Tibetan foundries seem to have used whatever base metal was available, and not to have been too careful in ensuring proper mixing. Pieces made in China or Mongolia are generally much more homogenous.

Precious metals may be used, especially for Imperial Chinese commissions, but figures mainly in gold or silver are very rare; evidently some were made, but they have presumably been recycled as bullion later on. A very high-quality yab-yum pair in the Hermitage Museum with an inscribed date to the Ming Yongle reign of 1403–1425 is made of copper and about 40% gold, but this is a rarity.

Tibet has deposits of gold, but under the influence of Bon, mining was regarded as rather immoral, and only the meagre product of panning in rivers was acceptable. Large inflows of gold came from China only after the Mongol Yuan dynasty began to heavily patronize Tibetan Buddhism in the late 13th century.

Metal sculptures sometimes have colour added by a variety of techniques including inlays, partial gilding, lacquer paint, coloured wax, and using alloys with different metal mixtures, especially zinc to give different colours. Jewels may be inserted into the metal. The usual basic casting technique is lost wax casting; many works, especially in later periods, are cast in several pieces, then joined. Small relics of distinguished teachers were often placed inside the hollow statues, wrapped in paper with writing identifying them.
Many of the common materials for sculpture are not often used in Tibet. Wood was expensive, and generally used for buildings, furniture and caskets rather than sculpture (the wood reliefs at the Jokhang in Lhasa are by Nepali sculptors brought in for the purpose). Wood doorway surrounds in monasteries sometimes had figurative carvings. But small works in wood, ivory, terracotta and stone are found. Stone is mainly used for small steles carved in relief, or rock reliefs carved into cliffs beside paths, which were then painted.

Large sculptures, almost all sacred figures in a meditating or teaching seated position, are mostly for the altars of temples or prayer halls. The Tibetan prototype for these is the Jowo, a bronze statue of the Buddha in Lhasa, supposedly brought from China by a Tang dynasty princess marrying the Tibetan king. Most later Tibetan examples are made of clay or rammed earth over a hollow interior stuffed with straw, with wood supports for the largest. They are then painted and partly gilded, and often finished with varnish.

Tsa-tsa are small relief plaques or miniature chortens made in moulds with clay or rammed earth. Many are left in places considered holy, and the chorten-shaped ones play a part in funerary rituals. Some include ashes from the cremated remains of a deceased person, or objects symbolizing them. Others, like their Indian predecessors, work as souvenirs of pilgrimages, and are taken home to be displayed.

==Other media for Buddhist art==

There are types of Buddhist art that are deliberately temporary, for use in rituals and meditation. The best known of these is the sand mandala, a largely geometric image made up with grains of sand or minerals, where necessary dyed to give several bright colours. These are placed onto a drawn pattern on a flat and even ground surface with great skill, using cone-shaped funnels called &quot;chak-pur&quot; and fingers. The mandala is generally square or round, and can be between two and three metres across. Making the mandala is itself a religious act, and the image&#x27;s temporary nature is part of the teaching. Many are made for festivals, and after a few days on display they are simply swept away. The same patterns are often used in painted thangkas, with or without figures, which are generally not attempted in sand.

&quot;Torma&quot; are sculpted ritual offerings made of edible materials, with yak butter and flour the most common and often the only main ingredients, along with colourings. They are therefore a form of butter sculpture. Eggs, milk and other ingredients even including meat may be used. They are used in various contexts, the most common of which is being placed on altars. Very large ones may be made for special festivals. Some are eaten after a period of ritual use.
Many types of object for both religious or secular use were lavishly decorated in the same styles, mixing metalwork with gemstones. These include vases, offering plates and model mountain &quot;mandala plates&quot;, containers and other objects for altars, rituals, and the private use of senior monks, as well as use by wealthy lay persons. In recent centuries China was the main influence on the rich ornamentation used, with Nepal and India prominent earlier.

Tibetan Buddhism has a number of distinctive ritual instruments, some for use on general altars, and others for special tantric rituals; some are used in both. There are also musical instruments used in religious ceremonies, but these are not covered here. Many of the instruments are shared with the Hindu tantra tradition. Most are usually in bronze, and the most important are the vajra (or &quot;dorje&quot;), a small ritual weapon that is normally accompanied by a small bell, the &quot;phurba&quot; dagger, &quot;kartika&quot; flaying knife, the &quot;khatvanga&quot; staff or wand, and the &quot;kapala&quot;, a skull cup, using a real skull, but often with an elaborate metalwork setting. The &quot;kangling&quot; thigh-bone trumpet, also mainly real bone, may also have metal mounts. 
Oracles such as the Nechung or &quot;Official State Oracle&quot; have extremely elaborate costumes and other special ritual implements for giving their predictions. The costumes include much carved bone, as do some of those for performers in the cham dances and adepts in some tantric rituals. Apart from necklaces and other jewellery forms, there are &quot;aprons&quot; with bone plaques large enough to hold complex relief carvings.

Woodblock printing was used for both text and images, or a combination. This was both on paper for books or single sheets, or on textiles, where it was very widely used for prayer flags. As with the prayer wheels outside religious buildings, usually made of brass with the prayer inscribed in relief, setting the text in motion, whether by the wind in the case of flags, or by hand turning in the case of the wheels, was believed to increase the efficacy of the prayer or mantra. Designs including the Wind Horse are among the most popular. Usually, the design for the wooden block was drawn by a monk, but carving the block was done by lay craftspeople outside the monastery.

==Secular art==
Traditional Tibetan society had a relatively small but wealthy upper class, as well as prosperous merchants. These patronised the religious arts (most wealthy men had spent some of their youth in monastic training), but also the usual range of secular forms. Monasteries also contained secular art in such forms as woolen Tibetan rugs. The usual form of these before 1950 is the &quot;khaden&quot; or sleeping carpet, also used for sitting or meditating on, with either geometric of simple figural designs, the latter often versions of Chinese motifs. The imitation tiger-skin &quot;tiger rug&quot; at least began as a substitute for real tiger-skins, which Buddhist and Hindu tantric masters are often shown sitting on in Indian art, or wearing as a cloak. But it seems to have become a prestigious thing to sit on for all types of person.
Tibetan clothing for the wealthy was elaborate and very brightly coloured. Chinese silks were much used, and imitated locally. Otherwise women wore skirts of local hand-woven cloth with lines of different colours. The clothing of the poor in 19th-century photographs generally appears very ragged, at least for working men. Tibetan jewellery, worn in profusion by both sexes, was chunky rather than highly refined, usually mainly in silver. Turquoise was one of the gemstones mined in Tibet, and much used. Elite Tibetan women wore their hair elaborately tied high over the head on formal occasions, hanging jewellery on it. Various personal items such as saddles and horse trappings could be highly decorated in similar techniques. The &quot;chab chab&quot;, worn by women, is a brooch from which a set of small useful tools such as spoons, picks and knives hang by short chains. The chuckmuck, not exclusive to Tibet, is a fire-lighting kit, typically hung from the belt by a short strap. Thokcha are small amulets of various shapes made (or supposed to be made) from meteoric iron, which were in use well before Buddhism arrived.

Furniture, in recent centuries tending to loosely follow Chinese forms, can be very finely made, and are usually highly decorated. Caskets, boxes and covers for manuscripts and storage chests were also important. Tibetan horse trappings, arms and armour for the elite were often highly decorated; a reasonable number have survived because there was relatively little evolution in what was used for fighting until the 20th century, and also because items were given as votive offerings to monasteries.

==Buddhist iconography==

A high proportion of both thangkas and sculptures have as their main subject a single sacred figure, or two of them embracing in the yab-yum position. These are very often surrounded with other figures, much smaller, often representing a wide range of persons or qualities. Buddhist symbols often appear. The main figures are buddhas, bodisattvas, the various types of &quot;deity&quot; in Tibetan Buddhism, and sometimes distinguished monks of the past, who may be regarded as bodhisattvas. Very often the figures at the top represent the &quot;lineage&quot; of teachings relating to the main figure, including a mixture of semi-legendary early and foundational figures, and more recent monks.

Large numbers of these are yidams or meditation deities. The appearance of these and their surrounding elements is set out in great detail in texts, which the thangkas follow closely, and monks are required to memorize and meditate on these for very long periods. In many cases it is eventually explained to the initiate that the deity has no existence outside the mind of persons meditating on them, and the purpose of the exercise is to realize within the meditator the qualities the deity embodies, as part of the Buddhist practices of refuge and deity yoga.
Tibetan art is especially rich, compared to that of other Buddhist countries, in depictions of &quot;fierce&quot; figures, sometimes called a figure&#x27;s &quot;wrathful aspect&quot; or &quot;expression&quot;. These are to be understood as protective figures, versions of buddhas or bodhisattvas that can also be shown in their pacific aspect. Indeed, thanks to the very complex Tibetan understanding of their nature, important figures have a number of different &quot;aspects&quot;, which may be depicted very differently. Sometimes these are shown in compartments around the edge of the composition. They are often depicted standing on much smaller figures personifying the malign forces they have overcome, and the skulls or heads of others may hang from their belt or neck as a mundamala or skull garland. There may also be skulls in their crown.

The foundation story of Tibetan Buddhism has much on early leaders, above all Padmasambhava, subduing evil spirits that previously dominated Tibet. The &quot;Dharmapala&quot; are one class of these fierce protectors, and one of them, Mahakala, was at various times given a particular role as the national protector, of Tibet and of the Mongol Empire. Tibetan Buddhism also arose and consolidated at the same time as Indian Buddhism declined, a process that is still rather unclear, but at times involved considerable violence, perhaps increasing the perceived need for powerful protective figures.
Narrative depictions of the lives of religious figures are found in thangkas, usually with the various events shown around a much larger central figure. The life of Gautama Buddha is depicted, as well as his previous lives, but the other most important buddhas and bodisattvas generally lack biographies. Tibetan figures such as Padmasambhava, Milarepa, and famous monks such as Sakya Pandita, and the Third Dalai Lama may be treated in a similar style. From the 18th century these scenes may be placed in a detailed landscape drawing on Chinese styles. Another style has a main central figure with much smaller portraits around the edge of the composition, either in compartments or in later examples in a landscape setting. These may be divine figures, or monks who were mentors or pupils.

Other portraits of monks are simpler, concentrating on the main figures. Some may date to the lifetime of the subject, though other are of figures long dead. It has been argued that portraits of living and dead figures are distinguished by the dead being shown seated on a lotus throne, but a recent study rejects this and instead argues that the side on which the tögag monastic robe is folded under the arm may indicate this. Small bronze sculpted portraits are also mostly straightforward, showing the subject seated on a base, not always wearing their ceremonial hat. One such bronze has an inscription saying it was made for the bedroom of a senior lama, perhaps the subject.

Another subject for thangkas is the various heavens or Pure lands of the main buddhas, especially Amitābha&#x27;s Sukhavati, and the mystic earthly kingdom of Shambhala. In recent centuries, these have also been given panoramic landscape backgrounds. There are also paintings showing monasteries, usually concentrating on the buildings rather than the (often spectacular) settings.

The Ashtamangala, or &quot;Eight Auspicious Symbols&quot; very frequently appear in various contexts, for example held by figures. They belong to wider Buddhist traditions, and originated in India.

==Buddhist background==

As Mahayana Buddhism emerged as a separate school in the 4th century AD, it emphasized the role of bodhisattvas, compassionate beings who forgo their personal escape to nirvana in order to assist others. From an early time, various bodhisattvas were also subjects of statuary art. Tibetan Buddhism, as an offspring of Mahayana Buddhism, inherited this tradition. But the additional dominating presence of the Vajrayana (or Buddhist tantra) may have had an overriding importance in the artistic culture. A common bodhisattva depicted in Tibetan art is the deity Chenrezig (Avalokitesvara), often portrayed as a thousand-armed saint with an eye in the middle of each hand, representing the all-seeing compassionate one who hears our requests. This deity can also be understood as a &quot;yidam&quot;, or &#x27;meditation Buddha&#x27; for Vajrayana practice.

More specifically, Tibetan Buddhism contains Tantric Buddhism, also known as Vajrayana Buddhism for its common symbolism of the &quot;vajra&quot;, the diamond thunderbolt (known in Tibetan as the dorje). Most of the typical Tibetan Buddhist art can be seen as part of the practice of tantra. Vajrayana techniques incorporate many visualizations during meditation, and most of the elaborate tantric art can be seen as aids to these visualizations; from representations of meditational deities (yidams) to mandalas and all kinds of ritual implements. There are distinct tantric rituals, mostly originating in India, but some apparently incorporating elements from Tibetan shamanism. These are conducted alone or before a small group of initiates.
==Bön==

The indigenous shamanistic religion of the Himalayas is known as Bön, which has survived in a monastic form, co-existing with Tibetan Buddhism, and producing similar art. Bon contributes a pantheon of local tutelary deities to Tibetan art. In Tibetan temples (known as lhakhang), statues of the Buddha or Padmasambhava are often paired with statues of the tutelary deity of the district who often appears angry or dark. These gods once inflicted harm and sickness on the local citizens but after the arrival of Padmasambhava these negative forces have been subdued and now must serve Buddha.

Bon images are often extremely similar to Tibetan Buddhist ones, especially those produced by the Nyingma order, which has the closest connections with Bon monasticism. Indeed, even experts are sometimes unable to be sure for which religion some works were produced. Other works depict the distinct Bon deities and historic teachers, but remain generally close to Buddhist styles; there was evidently considerable interchange between artists in both traditions. In general, Bon sacred figures do not appear in the complicated different forms and aspects of Buddhist ones, and a Bon fierce protective deity is likely only to have that form. Some differences are easier to see: Bon art uses the swastika rather than the vajra as a symbol of wisdom, and although their chorten (stupas) are &quot;almost identical&quot;, Bon devotees walk round them in the opposite direction (anti-clockwise) to Buddhists.

==Historical background==
===First transmission===

Pre-Buddhist art in Tibet is relatively little understood, apart from small personal items such as thokcha amulets, and prehistoric rock carvings of animals. All are hard to date. Stylistically, Buddhist art tends to be divided, at some periods more than others, into that from Western, Central and Eastern Tibet.

Buddhism achieved its final very strong position in Tibet in several stages, with reverses sometimes following periods of strong growth. The first arrival of Buddhism was traditionally with the two princesses, Nepali and Chinese, who came to marry King Songsten Gampo (reigned c. 627–649). Each came with monks and statues, and both Indian and Chinese styles of Buddhism (both Mahayana, but already somewhat divergent) were encouraged by the court. The core of the Jokhang in Lhasa survives from this period, and the Chinese Jowo statue, but Buddhism was essentially a court religion for some time after, and whether any Tibetan art survives is uncertain.
Songsten Gampo was the first of the &quot;Three Religious Kings&quot; (or &quot;Dharma Kings&quot;), followed by Trisong Detsen and Tri Relwajen, who reigned until about 836 (there are, or may have been, several intervening kings). King Trisong Detsen invited the Indian monk Śāntarakṣita, of Nalanda, who arrived in 761, but whose efforts were, according to Tibetan tradition, frustrated by evil native spirits. After retreating, and spending some years in Nepal, Śāntarakṣita returned with the Tantric adept Padmasambhava, who successfully defeated the evil spirits.

In 791 Buddhism was declared the official religion, and King Trisong Detsen eventually felt he had to make a choice between the Indian and Chinese styles of Buddhism. After hearing both groups of monks making their case, he chose the Indian ones, perhaps for political reasons, and thereafter Sanskrit texts have always been regarded in Tibet as the proper foundation for Buddhism. By this time some large monasteries had been built, and the Tibetan Empire had begun to encroach on China&#x27;s western borders; the Tibetan paintings found in Dunhuang are one major group of survivals. This period of expansion was soon followed by the Era of Fragmentation after 842, which saw the end of the unified kingdom, and much tension between Bon and Buddhism, which declined severely, especially in Central Tibet.
===Second Transmission===
The &quot;Later&quot; or &quot;Second Transmission&quot; began under King Yeshe-Ö of the Guge Kingdom in Western Tibet, who succeeded in getting the senior Indian monk Atisha to come to Tibet in 1042. Spreading over the next decades from Western to Eastern Tibet, Atisha and successors such as Dromtön and Marpa Lotsawa established many monasteries, and new orders of monks.

At this period Indian Buddhism was still a force in north-east India, though in decline, with large monastic complexes such as Nalanda in Bengal and modern Bihar, to the south of the region around Lhasa. There were considerable monastic interchanges between the two regions, with texts being taken north for copying and translating, and also evidently movement of artworks and probably artists. A greater number of Tibetan works have survived, many showing accomplished styles, with considerable Indian influence. Apart from portable works, the two outstanding survivals in wall paintings are the monasteries of Tabo and Alchi in modern Ladakh in India, relatively small establishments in Guge which largely escaped later rebuilding and repainting, and Chinese destruction.

The dominant type of monastic Buddhism in north-west India at the time was Vajrayana (or Tantric Buddhism, Esoteric Buddhism), and various sub-schools of this tradition became the norm in Tibet. Over the next century a number of monastic orders or schools emerged, the four major schools, with their approximate dates of foundation, being the Nyingma (c. 8th century), Kagyu (11th century), Sakya (1073), and Gelug (1409). These came to produce art with slight differences in both subject-matter and style.

===Mongol gold===
The situation transformed dramatically in the second half of the 13th century, as the protracted process of the Mongol conquest of China (1215–1294) drew to a close. Tibetan Buddhism had made considerable inroads in Mongolia, and became the official state religion of the new Mongol Yuan dynasty under Kublai Khan, though other religions were (most of the time) tolerated and sometimes patronized. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280), leader of the Sakya order, was made Imperial Preceptor and head of the new Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs. Over the next century monastic Buddhism received &quot;massive financial and material support by the Yuan state (1260-1368), most prominently in the form of several tons of gold and silver, and hundreds of thousands of bolts of silk&quot;.
Tibetan monasteries were established in China, mostly staffed by monks from Tibet. A large number of imperial ceremonies using the monks were established—a reform in 1331 reduced the number from 216 to 200 annually. Each of these might last several days, a &quot;short&quot; one taking a hundred monks for seven days, while a long one used forty monks for three years. These were lavishly rewarded: one seven day ritual was paid for with 600 kilos of silver. Large donations were used for building monasteries in Tibet, or commissioning art, but donations were also given to large numbers of individual monks, who might use them to make art. The Sakya order were the largest beneficiaries, but all orders benefited.

The Yuan emperors maintained large imperial workshops, whose main task was producing Buddhist images and designs for them. About half of the senior artists were Newari or Tibetan, with the rest Chinese. Drawings of the design were typically approved by members of the court and the Imperial Preceptor, who checked the details of the iconography were correct. Often old pieces were copied, and creatively reinterpreted. The Yuan empresses were especially fond of silver statues of female deities, most of which were melted down at some later point, as few of them survive. The records show that in 1329, the year after she became empress during a brief civil war, Budashiri, wife of the Wenzong Emperor, commissioned goddess figures that used a total of 2,220 kilos of silver.

Although the next Ming dynasty presented itself as a native Chinese dynasty expelling the foreign Mongol overlords, the founder, the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368–1398) had spent several years in a Chinese Buddhist monastery, and he and his successors continued to patronize Tibetan Buddhism, if not on as extravagant a scale as the Yuan. It suited Chinese governments to keep their neighbour to the West peaceful and largely devoted to religion; when necessary the Chinese intervened militarily in the sometimes fierce disputes between the different orders. The next Qing dynasty were Manchus, who kept their elite separate from the Han Chinese. They were largely Tibetan Buddhists, with the older traditions of Manchu shamanism still strong, and continued to patronize Tibetan Buddhism in China and Tibet until the end of imperial rule.

==Collecting==
There was relatively little Tibetan art outside the country until the end of the 19th century, except that in the Chinese imperial collections and in Tibetan monasteries in China. The first significant foreign collector was Prince Esper Ukhtomsky (1861–1921), a Russian author, publisher and Oriental enthusiast, with close access to the court. Ukhtomsky was strongly attracted to Asian art on aesthetic grounds, and eventually declared himself a Buddhist. During his travels in Tibet and Central Asia he amassed a large collection of Chinese and Tibetan art, that eventually numbered over 2,000 pieces.

In 1902 the collection was given to the Ethnographical Department of the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg. In 1933 it was divided between the Hermitage Museum, who received the largest and best share, and the Museum of the History of Religion, both in what was then Leningrad. The Hermitage&#x27;s share remains the basis of &quot;one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of Tibetan art&quot;. Unlike most Western museums, whose collections tend to be stronger in objects from southern and western Tibet, the Ukhtomsky collection is strongest in objects from northern and eastern Tibet, making it especially valuable.

In 1911, the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey, United States displayed the world&#x27;s first exhibition dedicated to Tibetan art. The museum continued to add more artifacts until the 1940s, amassing more than 5,000 pieces in its collection including paintings, sculptures, ritual objects, fine textiles and decorative arts. Today the museum houses over 5,500 Tibetan art artifacts, the largest and most distinctive in the Western Hemisphere, in eight permanent galleries with a Tibetan Buddhist altar as its centerpiece. The altar was consecrated in 1990 by the 14th Dalai Lama in 1990.

The upheavals in Tibet and China in the 20th century brought about large movements of portable art to the West, and the destruction of most that remained in the country. There was large-scale destruction during and after the invasion and annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1950 to 1951, the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to 1976, and at other times.

While wall paintings, large altar statues and other large art could usually not be moved, and a high proportion were destroyed, smaller thangka and bronzes were relatively easy to carry and left the country in large numbers. These were also the types of objects that probably had the greatest appeal to Western collectors, and were still relatively cheap in the mid-century. Several important private collections were formed, many of which subsequently passed to museums in the West, a process still continuing. The art historical understanding of Tibetan art, and its dating and regional differences also continues to develop.

Apart from museum collections in Tibet, China, St. Petersburg and Newark, many of the larger Western museums have significant collections, though most thangkas and textiles are not on permanent display for conservation reasons. Dedicated museums for Tibetan art in the West are the Rubin Museum of Art and Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art, both in New York City, and the Museum of Contemporary Tibetan Art in the Netherlands.

==Contemporary Tibetan art==
Contemporary Tibetan art refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the Tibetan diaspora, which is explicitly political and religious in nature. Contemporary Tibetan art includes modern thangka (religious scroll paintings) that resemble ancient thangka, as well as radical, avant-garde, works. Many artists, especially in monasteries, continue to produce traditional Tibetan styles, which are preferred for religious use, and also have markets inside and outside the Tibetan diaspora.

Popular Contemporary Tibetan artists include Karma Phuntsok, Tibetan-Swiss painter Sonam Dolma Brauen and Jamyang Dorjee Chakrishar.

<text>The R-13 () was a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) developed by the Soviet Union starting around 1955. It was assigned the NATO reporting name SS-N-4 Sark and carried the GRAU index 4K50.

==History==
Development of the R-13 was authorised by the Soviet Supreme Council on 25 July 1955 for use on the Project 629 and Project 658 submarines. The design work was started by OKB-1 under Sergei Korolev before being transferred to CB Miasskoe engineering / Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau (chief designer - Viktor Makeyev). Final technical specifications was approved by 11 January 1956. Serial production was undertaken at Zlatoust Machine-Building Plant in 1959. The R-13 was a single-stage liquid-fuel rocket and entered service in 1961. This missile was somewhat similar in design to the R-11FM missile, which caused some confusion in Western intelligence services during the Cold War. The missiles were phased out from 1965 to 1975.

This missile was the firstR-7? Soviet design to use a small set of rocket engines (vernier thrusters) to perform course and trajectory alterations instead of aerodynamic control surfaces, although a set of four stabilizers were used to keep the missile on-course during initial flight.

During initial testing before the missiles were deployed, 26 of 32 missiles (81%) were successfully launched. While the systems were deployed from 1961 to 1975, 225 of 311 launches (72%) were successful.

<doc id="529536" wikidata="Q9051832" url="?curid=529536" title="Offshoring">
<text>Offshoring is the relocation of a business process from one country to another—typically an operational process, such as manufacturing, or supporting processes, such as accounting. Usually this refers to a company business, although state governments may also employ offshoring. More recently, technical and administrative services have been offshored.

Offshoring neither implies nor precludes involving a different company to be responsible for a business process. Therefore, offshoring should not be confused with outsourcing which does imply one company relying on another. In practice, the concepts can be intertwined, i.e offshore outsourcing, and can be individually or jointly, partially or completely reversed, as described by terms such as reshoring, inshoring, and insourcing.

In-house offshoring is when the offshored work is done by means of an internal (captive) delivery model.

Imported services from subsidiaries or other closely related suppliers are included, whereas intermediate goods, such as partially completed
cars or computers, may not be.

== Motivation ==

Lower cost and increased profitability are often the motivation for offshoring. Economists call this labor arbitrage. More recently, offshoring incentives also include access to qualified personnel abroad, in particular in technical professions, and decreasing the time to market.

Jobs are added in the destination country providing the goods or services and are subtracted from the higher-cost labor country. The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the United States due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.

=== Criteria ===

Some criteria for a job to be offshore-able are:

* There is a significant wage difference between the original and offshore countries

* Remote work is possible in the job

* The work can be transmitted over the Internet

* The work is repeatable

== Variations ==

=== Offshore outsourcing ===

Subcontracting in the same country would be outsourcing, but not offshoring. A company moving an internal business unit from one country to another would be offshoring or physical restructuring, but not outsourcing. A company subcontracting a business unit to a different company in another country would be both outsourcing and offshoring, &quot;offshore outsourcing&quot;.

Types of offshore outsourcing include:

* Information technology outsourcing (ITO) is where outsourcing is related to technology or the internet, such as computer programming.

* Business process outsourcing (BPO) involves contracting out operational functions to a third-party service provider.

* Offshore Software development

* Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) is a type of outsourcing that involves or requires more advanced technical skills and a higher level of expertise.

* Customer Support Outsourcing (CSO) involves delegating customer service functions to offshore call centres or service providers to handle inquiries, complaints, and assistance.

* Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) is a workforce solution in which a business transfers all or part of its recruitment to an external provider. Businesses can deliver a standalone service or the entire operations. 

=== Nearshoring ===

Nearshoring is a form of offshoring in which the other country is relatively close such as one sharing a border.

Being nearby results in potentially beneficial commonalities such as temporal (time zone), cultural, social, linguistic, economic, political, or historical linkages.

According to the 1913 &quot;New York Times&quot; article &quot;Near Source of Supplies the Best Policy&quot;, the main focus was then on &quot;cost of production.&quot;
Although transportation cost was addressed, they did not choose among:
* transporting supplies to place of production
* transporting finished goods to place(s) of sale
* cost and availability of labor

The term &quot;nearshoring&quot; derives from &quot;offshoring&quot;. When combined with outsourcing, &quot;nearshore outsourcing&quot;, the nearshore workers are not employees of the company for which the work is performed. 

Nearshoring can involve business strategy to locate operations close to where product is sold. This is contrasted with using low-wage manufacturing operations in developing nations and shipping product back to the country that offshored the work. 

With nearshore outsourcing, the work is done by an outside company rather than internally, but in contrast to typical offshore outsourcing, the work is done in fairly close proximity to the company headquarters and its target market.

Nearshoring is often used for information technology (IT) processes such as application development, maintenance and testing. 

In Europe, nearshore outsourcing relationships are between clients in larger European economies and various providers in smaller European nations. The attraction is lower-cost skilled labor forces, and a less stringent regulatory environment, but crucially they allow for more day to day physical oversight. These countries also have strong cultural ties to the major economic centers in Europe as they are part of EU. For example, as of 2020 Portugal is considered to be the most trending outsourcing destination as big companies like Mercedes, Google, Jaguar, Sky News, Natixis and BNP Paribas opening development centers in Lisbon and Porto, where labor costs are lower, talent comes from excellent Universities, there&#x27;s availability of skills and the time zone is GMT (the same as London).

US clients nearshore to countries such as Canada, Mexico and nations in Central and South America.

==== Reasons to nearshore ====

===== Culture =====

Cultural alignment with the business is often more readily achieved through near-sourcing due to there being similarities between the cultures in which the business is located and in which services are sub-contracted, including for example proficiency with the language used in that culture.

===== Communication =====

Constraints imposed by time zones can complicate communication; near-sourcing or nearshoring offers a solution. English language skills are the cornerstone of Nearshore and IT services. Collaboration by universities, industry, and government has slowly produced improvements. Proximity also facilitates in-person interaction regularly and/or when required.

===== Other advantages =====

Software development nearshoring is mainly due to flexibility when it comes to upscale or downscale teams or availability of low cost
skilled developers. The nearshoring of call centers, shared services centers, and business process outsourcing (BPO) rose as offshore outsourcing was seen to be relatively less valuable. More recently, companies have explored nearshoring as a risk mitigation strategy for operational and supply chain weaknesses uncovered during the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis, when offshore BPOs experienced sudden closures and disruptive quarantine restrictions which hampered their ability to conduct day-to-day business operations.

The complexities of offshoring stem from language and cultural differences, travel distances, workday/time zone mismatches, and greater effort for needed for establishing trust and long-term relationships. Many nearshore providers attempted to circumvent communication and project management barriers by developing new ways to align organizations. As a result, concepts such as remote insourcing were created to give clients more control in managing their own projects. Nearshoring still has not overcome all barriers, but proximity allows more flexibility to align organizations.

=== Production offshoring ===

Production offshoring, also known as physical restructuring, of established products involves relocation of physical manufacturing processes overseas, usually to a lower-cost destination or one with fewer regulatory restrictions.

Physical restructuring arrived when the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) made it easier for manufacturers to shift production facilities from the US to Mexico.

This trend later shifted to China, which offered cheap prices through very low wage rates, few workers&#x27; rights laws, a fixed currency pegged to the US dollar, (currently fixed to a basket of economies) cheap loans, cheap land, and factories for new companies, few environmental regulations, and huge economies of scale based on cities with populations over a million workers dedicated to producing a single kind of product. However, many companies are reluctant to move high value-added production of leading-edge products to China because of lax enforcement of intellectual property laws.

===IT-enabled services offshoring===

Growth of offshoring has been linked to the availability of reliable and affordable communication infrastructure following the telecommunication and internet expansion of the late 1990s.

Much of the job movement was to outside companies, offshore outsourcing.

===Re-shoring===
Reshoring, also known as onshoring, backshoring or inshoring, is the act of reversing an offshoring change; moving a business process that was offshored, back to the original country.

John Urry, professor of sociology at Lancaster University, argues that the concealment of income, the avoidance of taxation and eluding legislation relating to work, finance, pleasure, waste, energy and security may be becoming a serious concern for democratic governments and ordinary citizens who may be adversely affected by unregulated, offshore activities. Further, the rising costs of transportation could lead to production nearer the point of consumption becoming more economically viable, particularly as new technologies such as additive manufacturing mature.

The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on the future of work considers the potential for automation to drive companies to reshore production, reducing the role of labor in the process, and offers suggestions as to how governments can respond. A similar movement can be seen related to Robotic Process Automation, called RPA or RPAAI for self-guided RPA 2.0 based on artificial intelligence, where the incentive to move repetitive shared services work to lower cost countries is partially taken away by the progression of technology.

Melanie Rojas &quot;et al&quot; in a 2022 Deloitte&#x27;s report commend adopting a combination of re-shoring and friendshoring - &quot;working with other nations and trusted supply sources&quot; - as a business practice and policy initiative aiming to promote supply chain resilience.

== Practices ==

=== Destinations ===

After its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, the People&#x27;s Republic of China emerged as a prominent destination for production offshoring. Another focus area has been the software industry as part of global software development and developing global information systems. After technical progress in telecommunications improved the possibilities of trade in services, India became one prominent destination for such offshoring, though many parts of the world are now emerging as offshore destinations.

=== United States ===

Since the 1980s American companies have been &quot;offshoring&quot; and outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries such as India, China, Malaysia, Pakistan and Vietnam.

==== Government response ====

President Obama&#x27;s 2011 SelectUSA program was the first federal program to promote and facilitate U.S. investment in partnership with the states. This program and website helps companies connect with resources available on a Federal, State and local level. In January 2012, President Obama issued a call to action to &quot;invest in America&quot; at the White House &quot;Insourcing American Jobs&quot; Forum.

==== Success stories ====

Advances in 3D printing technologies brought manufacturers closer to their customers.

There have been several very successful stories of companies. In most cases hundreds if not thousands of jobs were created or reinstated. In the case of Starbucks, in 2012 it saved American Mug and Stein Company in East Liverpool, Ohio from bankruptcy.

==== Avoiding failure ====

Some cases of reshoring have not been successful. Otis Elevators&#x27; reshoring effort did not go well. Otis says it failed to consider the consequences of the new location and tried to do too much at once, including a supply-chain software implementation. This is not an uncommon reshoring scenario. Bringing manufacturing back to the United States isn&#x27;t so simple, and there are a lot of considerations and analyses that companies must do to determine the costs and feasibility of reshoring. Some companies pursue reshoring with their own internal staff. But reshoring projects are complicated and involve engineering, marketing, production, finance, and procurement. In addition, there are real estate concerns, government incentives and training requirements that require outreach to the community. To help with these projects, companies often turn to consultants that specialize in reshoring.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, companies have used the reintroduction of domestic call centres as a unique selling point. In 2014, the RSA Insurance Group completed a move of call centres back to Britain. The call centre industry in India has been hit by reshoring, as businesses including British Telecom, Santander UK and Aviva all announced they would move operations back to Britain in order to boost the economy and regain customer satisfaction.

=== R&amp;D offshoring ===
Product design, research and the development (R&amp;D) process is relatively difficult to offshore because R&amp;D, to improve products and create new reference designs, requires a higher skill set not associated with cheap labor.

==== Transfer of intellectual property ====
There is a relationship between offshoring and patent-system strength. Companies under a strong patent system are not afraid to move work offshore because their work will remain their property. Conversely, companies in countries with weak patent systems have an increased fear of intellectual property theft from foreign vendors or workers, and, therefore, have less offshoring.

Offshoring is often enabled by the transfer of valuable information to the offshore site. Such information and training enables the remote workers to produce results of comparable value previously produced by internal employees. When such transfer includes protected materials, as confidential documents and trade secrets, protected by non-disclosure agreements, then intellectual property has been transferred or exported. The documentation and valuation of such exports is quite difficult, but should be considered since it comprises items that may be regulated or taxable.

== Debate ==

Offshoring to foreign subsidiaries has been a controversial issue spurring heated debates among economists. Jobs go to the destination country and lower cost of goods and services to the origin country.

On the other hand, job losses and wage erosion in developed countries have sparked opposition. Free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.

Currency manipulation by governments and their central banks cause differences in labor cost. On May 1, 2002, Economist and former Ambassador Ernest H. Preeg testified before the Senate committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs that China, for instance, pegs its currency to the dollar at a sub-par value in violation of Article IV of the International Monetary Fund Articles of Agreement which state that no nation shall manipulate its currency to gain a market advantage.

=== Source of conflict ===

The opposing sides regarding offshoring, outsourcing, and offshore outsourcing are those seeking government intervention and Protectionism versus the side advocating Free Trade.

Jobs formerly held by U.S. workers have been lost, even as underdeveloped countries such as Brazil and Turkey flourish. Free-trade advocates suggest economies as a whole will obtain a net benefit from labor offshoring, but it is unclear if the displaced receive a net benefit.

Some wages overseas are rising. A study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that Chinese wages were almost tripled in the seven years following 2002. Research suggests that these wage increases could redirect some offshoring elsewhere.

Increased training and education has been advocated to offset trade-related displacements, but it is no longer a comparative advantage of high-wage nations because education costs are lower in low-wage countries.
=== U.S. labor market ===

In 2015, IT employment in the United States has recently reached pre-2001 levels and has been rising since.

The number of jobs lost to offshoring is less than 1 percent of the total US labor market. The total number of jobs lost to offshoring, both manufacturing and technical represent only 4 percent of the total jobs lost in the US. Major reasons for cutting jobs are from contract completion and downsizing. Some economists and commentators claim that the offshoring phenomenon is way overblown.

=== Impact on jobs in western countries ===
&quot;The Economist&quot; reported in January 2013 that &quot;High levels of unemployment in Western countries after the 2007-2008 financial crisis have made the public in many countries so hostile towards offshoring that many companies are now reluctant to engage in it.&quot; Economist Paul Krugman wrote in 2007 that while free trade among high-wage countries is viewed as win-win, free trade with low-wage countries is win-lose for many employees who find their jobs offshored or with stagnating wages.

Two estimates of the impact of offshoring on U.S. jobs were between 150,000 and 300,000 per year from 2004 to 2015. This represents 10-15% of U.S. job creation.

The increased safety net costs of the unemployed may be absorbed by the government (taxpayers) in the high-cost country or by the company doing the offshoring. Europe experienced less offshoring than the U.S. due to policies that applied more costs to corporations and cultural barriers.

In the area of service research has found that offshoring has mixed effects on wages and employment.
The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report on the future of work highlights how offshoring can shape the demand for skills in receiving countries and explores how increasing automation can lead to reshoring of production in some cases.

===Public opinion===
U.S. opinion polls indicate that between 76-95% of Americans surveyed agreed that &quot;outsourcing of production and manufacturing work to foreign countries is a reason the U.S. economy is struggling and more people aren&#x27;t being hired.&quot;

== Theory ==

=== Effects of factor of production mobility ===

According to classical economics, the three factors of production are land, labor, and capital. Offshoring relies heavily on the mobility of labor and capital; land has little or no mobility potential.

In microeconomics, working capital funds the initial costs of offshoring. If the state heavily regulates how a corporation can spend its working capital, it will not be able to offshore its operations. For the same reason the macroeconomy must be free for offshoring to succeed.

Computers and the Internet made work in the services industry electronically portable. Most theories that argue offshoring eventually benefits domestic workers assume that those workers will be able to obtain new jobs, even if by accepting lower salaries or by retraining themselves in a new field. Foreign workers benefit from new jobs and higher wages when the work moves to them.

Labor scholars argue that global labor arbitrage leads to unethical practices, connected to exploitation of workers, eroding work conditions and decreasing job security.

== History ==

In the developed world, moving manufacturing jobs out of the country dates to at least the 1960s while moving knowledge service jobs offshore dates to the 1970s and has continued since then. It was characterized primarily by the transferring of factories from the developed to the developing world. This offshoring and closing of factories has caused a structural change in the developed world from an industrial to a post-industrial service society.

During the 20th century, the decreasing costs of transportation and communication combined with great disparities on pay rates made increased offshoring from wealthier countries to less wealthy countries financially feasible for many companies. Further, the growth of the Internet, particularly fiber-optic intercontinental long haul capacity, and the World Wide Web reduced &quot;transportation&quot; costs for many kinds of information work to near zero.

===Impact of the Internet===
Regardless of size, companies benefit from accessibility to labor resources across the world. This gave rise to business models such as Remote In-Sourcing that allow companies to tap into resources found abroad, without losing control over security of product quality.

New categories of work such as call centres, computer programming, reading medical data such as X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging, medical transcription, income tax preparation, and title searching are being offshored.

===Ireland===
Before the 1990s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the EU. Because of Ireland&#x27;s relatively low corporate tax rates, US companies began offshoring of software, electronic, and pharmaceutical intellectual property to Ireland for export. This helped create a high-tech &quot;boom&quot; which led to Ireland becoming one of the richest EU countries.

===NAFTA===
In 1994 the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect, and it increased the velocity of physical restructuring.

The plan to create free trade areas (such as Free Trade Area of the Americas) has not yet been successful. In 2005, offshoring of skilled work, also referred to as knowledge work, dramatically increased from the US, which fed the growing worries about threats of job loss.

It was constructed between 27 BC and AD 68, and is among the world&#x27;s six largest surviving Roman arenas. The arena is also the country&#x27;s best-preserved ancient monument.

The amphitheatre was depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 10 kuna banknote, issued in 1993, 1995, 2001 and 2004.

== History ==

The Arena was built between 27 BC and 68 AD, as the city of Pula became a regional centre of Roman rule, called &quot;Pietas Julia&quot;. The building is named after the sand (Latin &quot;harena&quot;) that once covered the inner performance area. It was built outside the town walls along the &quot;Via Flavia&quot;, the road from Pula to Aquileia and Rome.

The amphitheatre was first built in timber during the reign of Augustus (2–14 AD). It was replaced by a small stone amphitheatre during the reign of Emperor Claudius. In 79 AD it was enlarged to accommodate gladiator fights by Vespasian and to be completed in 81 AD under Emperor Titus. This was confirmed by the discovery of a Vespasian coin in the malting.

In legend, Saint Germanus, of whom little is known, was tortured in the Amphitheatre in or around 290, and subsequently martyred outside the city, on the road to Nesactium. The amphitheatre remained in use until the 5th century, when Emperor Honorius prohibited gladiatorial combats. It was not until 681 that combat between convicts, particularly those sentenced to death, and wild animals was forbidden. In the 5th century the amphitheatre began to see its stone plundered by the local populace. By the 13th century, the patriarch of Aquileia forbade further removal from the arena.

== Construction ==

The exterior wall is constructed in limestone. The part facing the sea consists of three stories, while the other part has only two stories since the amphitheatre was built on a slope. The maximum height of the exterior wall is . The first two floors have each 72 arches, while the top floor consists of 64 rectangular openings.

The axes of the elliptical amphitheatre are long, and the walls stand high. It could accommodate 23,000 spectators in the cavea, which had forty steps divided into two &quot;meniani&quot;. The seats rest directly on the sloping ground; The field for the games, the proper &quot;arena&quot;, measured . The field was separated from the public by iron gates.
The arena had a total of 15 gates. A series of underground passageways were built underneath the arena along the main axis from which animals, ludi scenes and fighters could be released; stores and shops were located under the raked seating. The amphitheatre was part of the circuit of the gladiators.

Each of the four towers had two cisterns filled with perfumed water that fed a fountain or could be sprinkled on the spectators. The amphitheatre could be covered with &quot;velaria&quot; (large sails), protecting the spectators from sun or rain (as attested by rare construction elements). Below the arena was a system of canals which collected rainwater and effluent and drained into the sea.

This amphitheatre, through its conservation, has served as an example for the study of ancient building techniques.

===Later use===
In the Middle Ages the interior of the Arena was often used for grazing, occasional tournaments by the Knights of Malta and medieval fairs. In 1583 the Venetian Senate proposed dismantling the arena and rebuilding it within Venice. The proposals were rejected. Today, a headstone celebrating the Venetian senator opposition to the plan is currently visible on the second tower.

In 1789, stone was taken from Pula arena for the belfry foundations at Pula Cathedral. This was the last time the arena was used as a source of stone.

===Restoration===
General Auguste de Marmont, as governor of the Illyrian Provinces during the First French Empire, started the restoration of the arena. This was continued in 1816 by the Ticinese architect Pietro Nobile, commissioned by the Emperor Francis I of Austria.

In 1932, the arena was adapted for theatre productions, military ceremonies and public meetings. In its present state, seating capacity is around 7,000 and 12,500 for all standing events.

==Present day==
The arena is used as a venue for many concerts. Performances have included ones by Duran Duran, Foo Fighters, Luciano Pavarotti, Đorđe Balašević, Plácido Domingo, Andrea Bocelli, Nina Badrić, Hillsong United, Patrizio Buanne, Jose Carreras, Dino Merlin, Jamiroquai, Anastacia, Eros Ramazzotti, Maksim Mrvica, Norah Jones, Zucchero, Zdravko Čolić, Alanis Morissette, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Elton John, Dua Lipa, Robbie Williams, 2Cellos, Sting, Michael Bolton, Seal, Il Divo, Tom Jones, Gibonni, Manu Chao, Oliver Dragojević, Leonard Cohen, Grace Jones, Moderat, David Gilmour, Avril Lavigne, Arctic Monkeys, Thompson and Frank Zivkovic. It has a capacity of about 5000 spectators, and also hosts operas, ballets, sports competitions as well as the Pula Film Festival. The arena is open to the public daily, and the underground passages house exhibitions of viticulture and olive growing in Istria.

The arena has also been used for cinematic works such as &quot;Titus&quot;, a 1999 film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s revenge tragedy &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; by Julie Taymor. On 8 July 2019, a football match was played between the former players of FC Bayern Munich and the Croatia national football team as part of a tourism partnership deal between FC Bayern Munich and the Istria Tourist Board signed in 2018. Two professional ice hockey games were played there on September 14 and 16, 2012; KHL Medveščak, a Zagreb-based Erste Bank Eishockey Liga club, hosted HDD Olimpija Ljubljana and the Vienna Capitals.

<text>Deaf culture is the set of social beliefs, behaviors, art, literary traditions, history, values, and shared institutions of communities that are influenced by deafness and which use sign languages as the main means of communication. When used as a cultural label, especially within the culture, the word &quot;deaf&quot; is often written with a capital &quot;D&quot; and referred to as &quot;big D Deaf&quot; in speech and sign. When used as a label for the audiological condition, it is written with a lower case &quot;d&quot;. Carl G. Croneberg was among the first to discuss analogies between Deaf and hearing cultures in his appendices C and D of the 1965 &quot;Dictionary of American Sign Language&quot;.

== Background ==
Members of the Deaf community tend to view deafness as a difference in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, in the sense of a community or culture, can then be seen as a linguistic minority, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who do not know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike some other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than needing to be born into it.
There are several perspectives on deaf people and Deaf culture that shape their treatment and role in society. From a medical standpoint, many encourage Deaf children to undergo surgery. Especially in the past, the medical perspective discouraged the use of sign language because they believed it would detract from the development of auditory and speech skills. From a social standpoint, Deaf individuals are welcomed to participate in society in the same manner as any other individual. This view discourages the idea that those who are deaf or hard-of-hearing are sick and in need of a cure. The social view also encourages making accommodations for deaf people so that they can fully participate in society. Such accommodations include the use of interpreters or improved closed captioning systems. Some feel the social view fails to recognize the unique qualities of Deaf people and Deaf culture. They believe that this perspective asks Deaf people to fit and find their own way in a predominantly hearing society, instead of recognizing their own abilities and culture. Another perspective is referred to as the cultural-linguistic view. Supporters of Deaf Culture state that this perspective appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a minority culture in the world with their own language and social norms. This standpoint is believed to promote Deaf people&#x27;s right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations.

Being involved in the Deaf community and culturally identifying as Deaf has been shown to significantly contribute to positive self-esteem in Deaf individuals. The community can provide support, easy social interaction, and &quot;refuge from the grinding frustrations of the hearing world.&quot; Conversely, Deaf individuals who are not a part of the Deaf community may not have the same support in the hearing world, resulting in lower self-esteem. Stereotypes, lack of knowledge, and negative attitudes about Deafness cause widespread discrimination. This could lead to a lower education and economic status for deaf people.
The community may include hearing family members of deaf people and sign-language interpreters who identify with Deaf culture. It does not automatically include all people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing. As educator and American Sign Language interpreter Anna Mindess writes, &quot;it is not the extent of hearing loss that defines a member of the deaf community but the individual&#x27;s own sense of identity and resultant actions.&quot; As with all social groups that a person chooses to belong to, a person is a member of the Deaf community if they identify as a member of the community and the community accept them as a member of the community.

Deaf culture is recognized under Article 30, Paragraph 4 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which states that &quot;Persons with disabilities shall be entitled, on an equal basis with others, to recognition and support of their specific cultural and linguistic identity, including sign languages and deaf culture.&quot;

Deaf culture is as well recognized in the statement presented at the 21st International Conference on Education of the Deaf in 2010 in Vancouver, Canada, where the more than 60 countries that participated in it agreed that &quot;Despite this &#x27;disability mindset,&#x27; Deaf citizens positively contribute to societies that embrace diversity and creativity. They enhance their nations in areas of education, economic activity, politics, arts and literature. For Deaf people, It is an inalienable right to be acknowledged as a linguistic and cultural minority integral to every society.&quot;

In Deaf culture, &quot;sumain&quot; refers to people who communicate with each other using their hands. Marla Berkowitz, a Certified Deaf ASL interpreter, describes it as &quot;a coined word from two languages – Su – your; main – hands&quot;.

==Acculturation==


Historically, acculturation has often occurred within schools for Deaf students and within Deaf social clubs, both of which unite deaf people into communities with which they can identify. Becoming Deaf culturally can occur at different times for different people, depending on the circumstances of one&#x27;s life. A small proportion of deaf individuals acquire sign language and Deaf culture in infancy from Deaf parents, others acquire it through attendance at schools, and yet others may not be exposed to sign language and Deaf culture until college or a time after that.

Although up to fifty percent of deafness has genetic causes, fewer than five percent of deaf people have a deaf parent, so Deaf communities are unusual among cultural groups in that most members do not acquire their cultural identities from parents.

===Diversity===
Educator and ASL interpreter Anna Mindess notes that there is &quot;not just one homogeneous deaf culture&quot;. There are many distinct Deaf communities around the world, which communicate using different sign languages and exhibit different cultural norms. Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of cultural identity. Deaf culture intersects with nationality, education, race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and other identity markers, leading to a culture that is at once quite small and also tremendously diverse. The extent to which people identify primarily with their deaf identity rather than their membership in other intersecting cultural groups also varies. Professor Anthony J. Aramburo found in a study titled &quot;The Sociolinguistic Aspects of the Black Deaf Community&quot; (1989) that &quot;87 percent of black deaf people polled identified with their black culture first&quot;. Deaf youth who belong to multiple minority groups face exceptional challenges. Deaf Black individuals may encounter discrimination from both hearing people of the Black community and White deaf individuals. Though racism is not greater than audism, the intersection of race and deafness (and other identities) can increase the barriers to success and compound hardship. Therefore, it is crucial to acknowledge the intersectionality of Black Deaf students as it plays a significant role in their educational success.

In his central work on Deafhood, English scholar Pady Ladd often emphasizes a strong sense of collectivity within the Deaf community, but also correctly points out that other forms of marginalization also exist within this community, e.g. towards Deaf people from other countries. Racial discrimination is also noted: Deaf schools in the USA did not admit black students for a long time. The examples mentioned by Ladd also point to tendencies towards gender discrimination. He also points out that his analyses focus strongly on the USA and the UK, and that the situation and self-definition of d/Deaf people in other countries can differ greatly. Like other authors, however, he assumes a common core of a Deaf culture that arises from experiences as a Deaf person(s). Research in Tanzania in the early 21st century resulted in differing analysis whether or not - or how much - the identify of deaf Tanzanians can be characterized as Deaf, pointing also to intersectional identities.

== Education ==

Deaf culture is prevalent in K–12 schools for the deaf throughout the world, though higher education specifically for them is more limited.

Abbé Charles-Michel de l&#x27;Épée opened the first school for the deaf in Paris called the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris (English: &quot;National Institute for Deaf Children of Paris)&quot; in 1760. The American Thomas Gallaudet witnessed a demonstration of deaf teaching skills from Épée&#x27;s successor Abbé Sicard and two of the school&#x27;s deaf faculty members, Laurent Clerc and Jean Massieu; accompanied by Clerc, he returned to the United States, where in 1817 they founded American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. American Sign Language (ASL) started to evolve from primarily French Sign Language (LSF), and other outside influences.

In a residential school where all the children use the same communication system (whether it is a school using sign language, Total Communication or Oralism), students will be able to interact &quot;normally&quot; with other students, without having to worry about being criticized. An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.

=== United States ===

In comparison to the general public, deaf people have lower levels of educational achievement. Advocates in deaf education believe that an improved recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) as an official language would improve education, as well as economic status. Some argue that by improving the recognition of ASL, better access to school materials, deaf teachers, interpreters, and video-telephone communication would take place.
Often colloquially referred to as the &quot;Big Three&quot; schools for the Deaf in the United States, California State University at Northridge (CSUN), National Technical Institute for the Deaf (part of Rochester Institute of Technology), and Gallaudet University are post-secondary institutions that serve a large population of Deaf students. Gallaudet University is the first and only liberal-arts college for deaf students in the world.

Those who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education. If a child does qualify as being deaf or hard of hearing and receives an individualized education plan, the IEP team must consider &quot;the child&#x27;s language and communication needs. The IEP must include opportunities for direct communication with peers and professionals. It must also include the student&#x27;s academic level, and finally must include the students full range of needs&quot;

In part, the U.S. Department of Education defines deafness as &quot;a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification&quot;. Hearing impairment is defined as &quot;an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child&#x27;s educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness&quot;.

=== Other countries ===

There are colleges across the globe. Brazil has several institutions, including Instituto Santa Tersinha and Escola para Crianças Surdas Rio Branco. China&#x27;s deaf universities include Beijing Union University, Special Education College of Beijing University, and Zhengzhou University. Other notable universities for the deaf across the globe include Finland School for the Deaf in Finland, Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris in France, and Berlin School for the Deaf in Germany.

==Characteristics==

Sign language is just one part of deaf culture. Deaf identity is also constructed around specific beliefs, values and art.

===Sign languages===
Members of Deaf cultures communicate via sign languages. Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker&#x27;s thoughts. &quot;Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information&quot;.

There are over 200 distinct sign languages in the world. These include 114 sign languages listed in the Ethnologue database and 157 more sign languages, systems, and dialects. While the United Kingdom and the United States are both predominantly English speaking, the predominant signed languages used in these countries differ markedly. Due to the origins of deaf education in the United States, American Sign Language is most closely related to French Sign Language.

===Values and beliefs===
* A positive attitude toward deafness is typical in Deaf cultural groups. Deafness is not generally considered a condition that needs to be fixed.
* The term &quot;Deaf Gain&quot; is used by Deaf people, to re-frame the perceived losses of Deafness and &quot;hearing loss&quot; to highlight the benefits of being deaf. According to deaf scientist Michele Cooke, it describes the benefits that Deaf people provide the larger community.
* Culturally, Deaf people value the use of natural sign languages that exhibit their own grammatical conventions, such as American Sign Language and British Sign Language, over signed versions of English or other oral languages. Spoken English, written English and signed English are three different symbolic systems for expressing the same language.
* Deaf communities strongly oppose discrimination against deaf people.
* Deaf culture in the United States tends to be collectivist rather than individualist; culturally Deaf people value the group.
* The use of a sign language is central to Deaf cultural identity. Oralist approaches to educating deaf children thereby pose a threat to the continued existence of Deaf culture. Some members of Deaf communities may also oppose technological innovations like cochlear implants for the same reason.
* Sign language was developed to enable the Deaf person to be closer to god.

=== Cochlear implants ===
A cochlear implant is not to be mistaken for a hearing aid, which makes noises and sounds louder for the user to hear. Instead, cochlear implants bypass the outer ear and target the inner ear where the auditory nerve fibers are stimulated. To do this, noises and sounds are transformed into electrical energy which is translated as audio information by the nerve which is then sent to the brain. An external microphone captures outside sound, a transmitter processes these sounds and sends them to a receiver embedded under the skin in the skull, and the receiver transforms these sounds into electrical impulses which stimulate the auditory nerve.The medical model of disability can be aligned with technological advancements in cochlear implants. This is due to the fact that cochlear implants can be perceived to &quot;cure&quot; deafness or fix an individual&#x27;s hearing, when in reality those who are Deaf may not feel a need to be cured or fixed. This idea is seen in many children&#x27;s books, where improved quality of life is only seen after characters obtain cochlear implants. This idea that deafness is a physiological issue that resides only within the individual and therefore should be physiologically fixed or solved counters the teachings and beliefs within Deaf culture. Often people feel as though children should make the decision if they want a cochlear implant for themselves as opposed to someone else, like their parents or caregivers, making it for them. Although ethical, this idea poses a problem since the success rate of cochlear implants is at its highest when implanted at early childhood; in other words, when the child is not able to make rather large decisions, like this one, for themselves. These critics argue forcing cochlear implants on children should be reduced and the assumption that cochlear implants offer the best quality of life for Deaf individuals should be countered. One way of doing this would be to expose children of young ages to Deaf culture and the Deaf community early on, as well as teach them American Sign Language.

Cochlear implants have been controversial around the Deaf community ever since they first were made available to the public. Those who oppose cochlear implants even refer to it as &quot;cultural genocide,&quot; as it lessens the prevalence and importance of Deaf culture. People are against cochlear implants for a variety of reasons, including: there is value to being Deaf, being Deaf is not an illness and does not require a cure, the Deaf are not lesser than the hearing, etc. Cochlear implants also have a variety of risks associated with them, like costliness, effectiveness, and surgical requirement. Alternative solutions proposed by cochlear opponents are centered around the social model of disability, where instead of fixing the actual hearing of the individual, reform and accommodations can be made in society, education, and more to better allow the individual to be integrated into society as would any other.

Alternatively, those who support cochlear implants do not necessarily oppose Deaf culture. Culture itself is not a simple concept, but rather it has high levels of complexity and power; due to this nature, culture is not to be applied narrowly to a group of individuals. The Deaf community is composed of highly diverse Deaf individuals, and to impose narrow culture onto a group full of heterogeneous members would be rather questionable. There is room for deviation and hybridization of values and beliefs in Deaf culture as society and technology evolves. Even if they are proud of their Deaf identity, many deaf individuals wish they knew what their voices sounded like, and wish they could pick up the phone and have a conversation with ease without the need for a third-party device or interpreter. So, instead of looking at cochlear implants as identity stripping, many Deaf parents of Deaf children see cochlear implants as a way to give their children more than what they have; to offer them the pleasure of being able to hear. It has also been proven that cochlear implants help to provide opportunities for success, and help individuals to feel more connected to the world. Though most Deaf individuals agree that choosing to use a cochlear implant is a difficult decision, many say that resistance to cochlear implants has decreased since 1990, the year when it was first approved for children. By building more evidence of the benefits and limitations of cochlear implants, both Deaf and hearing individuals can be properly educated on the impact of cochlear implants, and thus unrealistic expectations and controversies can be resolved.

===Behavioral patterns===
* Culturally Deaf people have rules of etiquette for getting attention, walking through signed conversations, leave-taking, and otherwise politely negotiating a signing environment.
* Deaf people also keep each other informed of what is going on in one&#x27;s environment. It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late; withholding such information may be considered rude.
* Deaf people may be more direct or blunt than their hearing counterparts.
* When giving introductions, Deaf people typically try to find common ground; since the Deaf community is relatively small, Deaf people usually have other Deaf people in common.
* Deaf people may also consider time differently. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This may be motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the Deaf person.

===Importance of technology===
* Like all other people, Deaf individuals rely on technology for communication significantly. In the United States, video relay services and an array of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the teletype (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication.
* Technology is even important in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing person who does not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes the place of a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures.
* Social media tends to be of great importance to deaf individuals. Networking sites allow deaf people to find each other and to remain in contact. Many deaf people have deaf friends throughout the entire country that they met or maintain contact with through online communities. Because of the relatively small size of the deaf community, compared to other communities, the stigma of meeting others online does not exist.
* Closed Captioning must be available on a television in order for a deaf person to fully appreciate the audio portion of the broadcast. Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.
* Alert systems such as fire alarms and alarm clocks must appeal to different senses in order for a deaf individual to notice the alert. Objects such as vibrating pillows and flashing lights often take the place of the noise-based alarms.
* Lack of understanding about technological accessibility for the deaf causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community. For example, a significant number of deaf individuals in the UK admit that they are dissatisfied with their banks because of their heavy reliance on telephone banking and lack of assistance to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.
* Architecture that is conducive to signed communication minimizes visual obstructions and may include such things as automatic sliding doors to free up the hands for continuous conversation.

===Literary traditions and the arts===

A strong tradition of poetry and storytelling exists in American Sign Language and other sign languages. Some prominent performers in the United States include Clayton Valli, Ben Bahan, Ella Mae Lentz, Manny Hernandez, CJ Jones, Debbie Rennie, Patrick Graybill, Peter Cook, and many others. Their works are now increasingly available on video.

Culturally Deaf people have also represented themselves in the dominant written languages of their nations.

Deaf artists such as Betty G. Miller and Chuck Baird have produced visual artwork that conveys a Deaf worldview. Douglas Tilden was a famous Deaf sculptor who produced many different sculptures in his lifetime. Some Deaf artists belong to an art movement called De&#x27;VIA, which stands for Deaf View Image Art.

Organizations such as the Deaf Professional Arts Network or D-PAN are dedicated to promoting professional development and access to the entertainment, visual and media arts fields for individuals who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

Daily Moth was established by Alex Abenchuchan in 2017 to make the news accessible for Deaf ASL users.

===History===

In the United States, the Cobbs School, a deaf school in Virginia, was established in 1815. This school lasted only one and half years due to financial setbacks. American Deaf Community recounts the story of Laurent Clerc, a deaf educator, coming to the United States from France in 1817 to help found the first permanent school for deaf children in the country now named American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. American School is the first official school for the deaf.

Another well-known event is the 1880 Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf in Milan, Italy, where hearing educators voted to embrace oral education and remove sign language from the classroom. This effort resulted in pressure around the world to abandon sign language in favor of the oral approach exclusively. The intent of the oralist method was to teach deaf children to speak and lip read with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom in order to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The Milan conference recommendations were repudiated in Hamburg a century later, and sign languages in education came back into vogue after the publication of Stokoe&#x27;s linguistic analyses of ASL.

===Shared institutions===

Deaf culture revolves around such institutions as residential schools for deaf students, universities for deaf students (including Gallaudet University and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf), deaf clubs, deaf athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes, founded by Jane Middleton, in New York City), deaf social organizations (such as the Deaf Professional Happy Hour), deaf religious groups, deaf theaters, and an array of conferences and festivals, such as the Deaf Way II Conference and Festival and the World Federation of the Deaf conferences.

Deaf clubs, popular in the 1940s and 1950s, were also an important part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that deaf people could call their own– places run by deaf people for deaf people. Films were made from the Los Angeles Club for the Deaf and included styles of performances such as Vaudeville show and short comedy skills. These films survived through the 1940s. Wolf Bragg, a popular Deaf club performer through 1930 is known for interpreting sign language into &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; and Auf Weidersehen. Deaf clubs were the solution to this need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. The main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today&#x27;s common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs.

In the 1960s, deaf clubs began their quick and drastic decline. Today there are only a few spread-out deaf clubs found in the United States and their attendance is commonly small with a tendency to the elderly. This sudden decline is often attributed to the rise of technology like the TTY and closed captioning for personal TVs. With other options available for entertainment and communication, the need for deaf clubs grew smaller. It was no longer the only option for getting in touch with other members of the deaf community.

Others attribute the decline of deaf clubs to the end of World War II and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World War II ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.

====African-American====
National Black Deaf Advocates was established in 1982 &quot;to promote the leadership development, economic and educational opportunities, social equality, and to safeguard the general health and welfare of Black deaf and hard-of-hearing people.&quot;

====LGBT====
There are several major institutions supporting the Deaf queer community in the United States. The Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf (RAD), previously named National Rainbow Society of the Deaf (NRSD), is a nonprofit established in America in 1977 to, &quot;establish and maintain a society of Deaf LGBT&quot;. The RAD hosts an annual conference &quot;to encourage and promote the educational, economical, and social welfare of Deaf LGBTQ individuals. RAD now has chapters in the United States and Canada. The Deaf Queer Resource Center (DQRC), was founded in 1995 founded by Drago Renteria and began as a website connects people to resources nationally. The DQRC is now a nonprofit that provides &quot;peer support, support groups, information and referrals, educational workshops, work to increase visibility, educate on accessibility and preserve Deaf LGBT history.&quot;

Support and community groups for people with intersectional LGBGTQ+ identities in the Deaf, DeafBlind, DeafDisabled and Hard of Hearing communities using ASL are held regionally and virtually. Queer ASL is an educational platform taught virtually by Deaf queer instructors focused on educating queer and trans people in a safe space. Deaf queer events include Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf conferences, the Deaf Lesbian Festival, and Deaf Queer Men Only.

Internationally, institutions include the Hong Kong Bauhinias Deaf Club, Deaf LGBTW in Fukoaka, Tohoku, Tokyo, and Osaka, Pinoy Deaf Rainbow in the Philippines, Deaf Rainbow NSW in Australia, Deaf Rainbow UK, Rainbow International Deaf at Israel, and the Greenbow LGBT Society of Ireland.

====Religious====

There are deaf churches (where sign language is the main language), deaf synagogues, deaf Jewish community centers, and the Hebrew Seminary of the Deaf in Illinois. In 2011 the Conservative Movement unanimously passed the rabbinic responsa, &quot;The Status of the Heresh [one who is deaf] and of Sign Language&quot;, by the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards (CJLS). This responsa declared that, among other things, &quot;The Committee on Jewish Law and Standards rules that the deaf who communicate via sign language and do not speak are no longer to be considered mentally incapacitated. Jews who are deaf are responsible for observing mitzvot. Our communities, synagogues, schools, and camps must strive to be welcoming and accessible, and inclusive. Sign language may be used in matters of personal status and may be used in rituals. A deaf person called to the Torah who does not speak may recite the berakhot via sign language. A deaf person may serve as a shaliah tzibbur in sign language in a minyan whose medium of communication is sign language.&quot;

====Women&#x27;s====
There are 15 chapters of Deaf Women United throughout the United States; its mission is, &quot;to promote the lives of Deaf women through empowerment, enrichment, and networking.&quot; There is also Pink Wings of Hope, an American breast cancer support group for deaf and hard-of-hearing women.

===Libraries===
The library at Gallaudet University, the only deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library&#x27;s collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world&#x27;s largest collection of deaf-related materials, with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The collection is so large that the library had to create a hybrid classification system based on the Dewey Decimal Classification System in order to make cataloging and location within the library easier for both library staff and users. The library also houses the university&#x27;s archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.

The American Library Association, also founded in 1876, has stated that disabled people belong to a minority that is often overlooked and underrepresented by people in the library, and the Deaf community belongs in this minority group. The ALA&#x27;s Library Bill of Rights preamble states that &quot;all libraries are forums for information and ideas&quot; and as such libraries need to remove the physical and technological barriers which in turn would allow persons with disabilities full access to the resources available.

One notable American activist in the library community working toward accessibility for the deaf was Alice Lougee Hagemeyer, herself deaf. In 1974 she created Deaf Awareness Week, later called Deaf Heritage Week, in which programs about deaf culture are held in libraries. In 1980 she founded the unit now known as the Library Service to People who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing Forum, which is a unit within the American Library Association.

Australian librarian Karen McQuigg stated in 2003 that &quot;even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively.&quot;

In 2006 the American Library Association and the (American) National Association of the Deaf declared that they would recognize March 13 to April 15 as National Deaf History Month.

New guidelines from library organizations such as International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) and the ALA were written in order to help libraries make their information more accessible to people with disabilities, and in some cases, specifically the Deaf community. IFLA&#x27;s &quot;Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People&quot; is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.

Over the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. For example, at the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler-Dunsmore, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler-Dunsmore was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.

===Services===
The library at Gallaudet University, the only Deaf liberal arts university in the world, was founded in 1876. The library&#x27;s collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world&#x27;s largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The library created a hybrid classification system based on an extension of the Dewey decimal system because traditional Dewey was not fine-grained enough to handle thousands of books in relatively small classification areas such as audiology or Deaf communication. The library also houses the university&#x27;s archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.

In Nashville, Tennessee, Sandy Cohen manages the Library Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (LSDHH). The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.

<text>Seymour Geisser (October 5, 1929 – March 11, 2004) was an American statistician noted for emphasizing predictive inference. In his book &quot;Predictive Inference: An Introduction&quot;, he held that conventional statistical inference about unobservable population parameters amounts to inference about things that do not exist, following the work of Bruno de Finetti. He also pioneered the theory of cross-validation.

With Samuel Greenhouse, he developed the Greenhouse–Geisser correction, which is now widely used in the analysis of variance to correct for violations of the assumption of compound symmetry.

He testified as an expert on interpretation of DNA evidence in more than 100 civil and criminal trials. He held that prosecutors often relied on flawed statistical models. On that topic, he wrote &quot;Statistics, Litigation and Conduct Unbecoming&quot; in the book &quot;Statistical Science in the Courtroom&quot;, edited by Joe [Joseph Louis] Gastwirth (Springer Verlag, 2000).

==Biography==
He was born in New York City. He earned his Ph.D. at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1955 under Harold Hotelling. In 1971, he founded the School of Statistics at the University of Minnesota, of which he was the Director for more than 30 years.

<text>Serra dos Órgãos National Park (: &quot;Organs Range&quot;) is a national park in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It protects the Serra dos Órgãos mountain range and the water sources in the range. It was the third national park to be created in Brazil.

==Location==

The Serra dos Órgãos National Park is located about a one-hour drive from the city of Rio de Janeiro.
The BR-116 highway leads through the park.
The origin of the unusual name is credited to early Portuguese settlers who thought the &quot;ensemble&quot; of the hill tops resembled the pipes of organs in European cathedrals.
The park is part of the larger Serra do Mar chain of mountains, and the most accepted theory about its origin is that it rose about 60 million years ago during earthquakes that caused the Andes to rise. That means it is located in a geologically unstable location, although no incident has ever been recorded in the area. 

The Park&#x27;s area is .
It has ten peaks higher than and six other peaks over high. The lowest point in the park is located in the relatively flat municipality of Magé, at . The highest peak is &quot;Pedra do Sino&quot; (Bell Rock), at . The most famous formation in the park is the &quot;Dedo de Deus&quot; (God&#x27;s Finger) peak, which resembles a left hand with its index finger stretched, pointing towards the sky. It is high and can be seen in the background of the of Rio de Janeiro state.

==History==

The Serra dos Órgãos National Park was created on 30 November 1939 as the third national park in Brazil.
The purpose of the park was to protect the headwaters of the rivers that flow into the Fluminense basin, and to protect the spectacular mountains.
The park was created by the government of Getúlio Vargas by decree law 1822 of 30 November 1939 with an area of about .
It covered parts of the municipalities of Magé, Petrópolis and Teresópolis.

Various buildings and other infrastructure were built in the 1940s such as the natural swimming pool, administrative buildings, warehouses, garage, staff quarters and four shelters on the Trilha do Sino (Bell Trail). The park had about 250 employees, including waiters in the mountain shelters.
In the 1960s, with the national capital transferred from Rio de Janeiro to Brasilia, the park lost funding and the facilities were allowed to deteriorate. The shelters and some of the staff homes were lost.

Efforts were made to restore the park from 1980, including publication of the management plan and purchase of land to regularize the park&#x27;s tenure.
Decree 90023 of 2 August 1984 delimited the area of the park as .
In the 1990s the municipality of Guapimirim was split off from Magé, and also contains the biggest part of the park.
From the 1990s the old buildings have been restored and new ones built.
The park was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, created in 2006.

==Environment==

The climate is tropical superhumid, with 80% to 90% relative humidity caused by moist air from the Atlantic most of the year.
Average temperatures range from , but may reach and may fall below freezing in the highest parts.
Average rainfall is , with more rain in the summer (December to March) and a dry season in the winter from June to August. The south east side facing the ocean receives more rain than the north west side.

The park is in the Atlantic Forest biome, and due to the high rainfall has rich vegetation, much of it unique to this biome.
More than 2,800 species of plant have been recorded including 360 of orchids and over 100 bromeliads.
Up to the lower slopes are covered by typical lowland rainforest.
From the vegetation is montane forest, with significant variations depending on the conditions in each area.
In many places the upper canopy is with emergent trees reaching up to .
From there is cloud forest, typically trees of with crooked trunks covered in epiphytic moss and plants such as bromeliads and orchids. The understory has shrubs and the outcrops are populated by ferns and mosses.
There are various endemic species.
Above the vegetation is high montane, with open fields and small woody shrubs.
347 species have been found in this environment of which 66 are endemic to this ecosystem.
The park is one of the few natural habitats of species of &quot;Schlumbergera&quot;, which were developed into the colourful &quot;Thanksgiving Cactus&quot; and &quot;Christmas Cactus&quot;, widely grown as house plants.

==Origins and meaning==

The earliest recorded version of the rhyme is in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot;, published in London in May 1744, which uses the opening line: &#x27;Hickere, Dickere Dock&#x27;. The next recorded version in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; (c. 1765), uses &#x27;Dickery, Dickery Dock&#x27;.

The rhyme is thought by some commentators to have originated as a counting-out rhyme. Westmorland shepherds in the nineteenth century used the numbers &quot;Hevera&quot; (8), &quot;Devera&quot; (9) and &quot;Dick&quot; (10) which are from the language Cumbric.

The rhyme is thought to have been based on the astronomical clock at Exeter Cathedral. The clock has a small hole in the door below the face for the resident cat to hunt mice.

<text>Extremal graph theory is a branch of combinatorics, itself an area of mathematics, that lies at the intersection of extremal combinatorics and graph theory. In essence, extremal graph theory studies how global properties of a graph influence local substructure.

Results in extremal graph theory deal with quantitative connections between various graph properties, both global (such as the number of vertices and edges) and local (such as the existence of specific subgraphs), and problems in extremal graph theory can often be formulated as optimization problems: how big or small a parameter of a graph can be, given some constraints that the graph has to satisfy?

A graph that is an optimal solution to such an optimization problem is called an extremal graph, and extremal graphs are important objects of study in extremal graph theory.

Extremal graph theory is closely related to fields such as Ramsey theory, spectral graph theory, computational complexity theory, and additive combinatorics, and frequently employs the probabilistic method.

==History==

Mantel&#x27;s Theorem (1907) and Turán&#x27;s Theorem (1941) were some of the first milestones in the study of extremal graph theory.
In particular, Turán&#x27;s theorem would later on become a motivation for the finding of results such as the Erdős–Stone theorem (1946). This result is surprising because it connects the chromatic number with the maximal number of edges in an formula_1-free graph. An alternative proof of Erdős–Stone was given in 1975, and utilised the Szemerédi regularity lemma, an essential technique in the resolution of extremal graph theory problems.

==Topics and concepts==

===Graph coloring===


A proper (vertex) coloring of a graph formula_2 is a coloring of the vertices of formula_2 such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The minimum number of colors needed to properly color formula_2 is called the chromatic number of formula_2, denoted formula_6. Determining the chromatic number of specific graphs is a fundamental question in extremal graph theory, because many problems in the area and related areas can be formulated in terms of graph coloring.

Two simple lower bounds to the chromatic number of a graph formula_2 is given by the clique number formula_8—all vertices of a clique must have distinct colors—and by formula_9, where formula_10 is the independence number, because the set of vertices with a given color must form an independent set.

A greedy coloring gives the upper bound formula_11, where formula_12 is the maximum degree of formula_2. When formula_2 is not an odd cycle or a clique, Brooks&#x27; theorem states that the upper bound can be reduced to formula_12. When formula_2 is a planar graph, the four-color theorem states that formula_2 has chromatic number at most four.

In general, determining whether a given graph has a coloring with a prescribed number of colors is known to be NP-hard.

In addition to vertex coloring, other types of coloring are also studied, such as edge colorings. The chromatic index formula_18 of a graph formula_2 is the minimum number of colors in a proper edge-coloring of a graph, and Vizing&#x27;s theorem states that the chromatic index of a graph formula_2 is either formula_12 or formula_22.

===Forbidden subgraphs===
The forbidden subgraph problem is one of the central problems in extremal graph theory. Given a graph formula_2, the forbidden subgraph problem asks for the maximal number of edges formula_24 in an formula_25-vertex graph that does not contain a subgraph isomorphic to formula_2. 

When formula_27 is a complete graph, Turán&#x27;s theorem gives an exact value for formula_28 and characterizes all graphs attaining this maximum; such graphs are known as Turán graphs. 
For non-bipartite graphs formula_2, the Erdős–Stone theorem gives an asymptotic value of formula_30 in terms of the chromatic number of formula_2. 
The problem of determining the asymptotics of formula_30 when formula_2 is a bipartite graph is open; when formula_2 is a complete bipartite graph, this is known as the Zarankiewicz problem.

===Homomorphism density===
The homomorphism density formula_35 of a graph formula_1 in a graph formula_2 describes the probability that a randomly chosen map from the vertex set of formula_1 to the vertex set of formula_2 is also a graph homomorphism. It is closely related to the subgraph density, which describes how often a graph formula_1 is found as a subgraph of formula_2.

The forbidden subgraph problem can be restated as maximizing the edge density of a graph with formula_2-density zero, and this naturally leads to generalization in the form of graph homomorphism inequalities, which are inequalities relating formula_35 for various graphs formula_1.
By extending the homomorphism density to graphons, which are objects that arise as a limit of dense graphs, the graph homomorphism density can be written in the form of integrals, and inequalities such as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Hölder&#x27;s inequality can be used to derive homomorphism inequalities.

A major open problem relating homomorphism densities is Sidorenko&#x27;s conjecture, which states a tight lower bound on the homomorphism density of a bipartite graph in a graph formula_2 in terms of the edge density of formula_2.

===Graph regularity===


Szemerédi&#x27;s regularity lemma states that all graphs are &#x27;regular&#x27; in the following sense: the vertex set of any given graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of parts such that the bipartite graph between most pairs of parts behave like random bipartite graphs.
This partition gives a structural approximation to the original graph, which reveals information about the properties of the original graph.

The regularity lemma is a central result in extremal graph theory, and also has numerous applications in the adjacent fields of additive combinatorics and computational complexity theory. In addition to (Szemerédi) regularity, closely related notions of graph regularity such as strong regularity and Frieze-Kannan weak regularity have also been studied, as well as extensions of regularity to hypergraphs. 

Applications of graph regularity often utilize forms of counting lemmas and removal lemmas. In simplest forms, the graph counting lemma uses regularity between pairs of parts in a regular partition to approximate the number of subgraphs, and the graph removal lemma states that given a graph with few copies of a given subgraph, we can remove a small number of edges to eliminate all copies of the subgraph.

<doc id="529574" wikidata="Q2675045" url="?curid=529574" title="Triumph the Insult Comic Dog">
<text>Triumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character created, puppeteered, and voiced by actor/comedian/director Robert Smigel. As his name indicates, Triumph&#x27;s comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy. A Montenegrin Mountain Hound, Triumph often is seen with a cigar in his mouth, which usually falls out of it when he starts talking. He first appeared in 1997 on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, and also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; from time to time, as well as the short-lived &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, TBS&#x27;s &quot;Conan&quot;, Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot;, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;. Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph&#x27;s antics, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the Honolulu line for auditions for &quot;American Idol&quot;, and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project).

== Creation and debut ==

The dog puppet was found, in an assortment of animal puppets, at a country furniture store, by Robert Smigel and his newlywed-wife, which Smigel used in-store to jokingly &quot;smell&quot; his newlywed-wife&#x27;s rear end. She bought an assortment of seven of those animal puppets, and later presented them to Smigel as a birthday gift.

For four years, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; had done remote segments parodying the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show.

On 13 February 1997, &quot;Triumph&quot;, the character, created by Robert Smigel, was first used for a segment on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; parodying the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, where Triumph (Ch. Triumph&#x27;s Honor of Whitehall, Yugoslavian Mountain Hound) appeared as a Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show winner (Hound division) in a vaudeville stage, with an Insult Comic talent, telling &quot;for me to poop on&quot; jokes later used in post-interview segments with ill-informed guests.

Triumph speaks with a nebulous Eastern European accent, which Smigel based on his grandparents who were immigrants from Russia.

&quot;Triumph&quot; first became a &quot;viral video&quot; at iFilm.

== Notable appearances ==

=== Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show ===

In 1999, Jordan Schlansky and the Triumph entourage crashed the 123rd annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden, New York City, and after some video shooting, were later ejected by security guards.

=== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ===

In May 2002, Triumph paid a visit to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans lining up for the premiere of &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; outside the Ziegfeld Theater in New York, airing 2002-05-17, mocking their actions and stereotypical nerd culture. Notable moments include a wedding that took place at the line, and the appearances of &quot;Blackwolf the Dragonmaster&quot; (Richard Washington), a real-life fantasy gaming fan and the &quot;Unofficial Wizard of New York&quot;, and Spock who gave everyone the finger. Smigel has said &quot;It&#x27;s still the Triumph sketch I hear the most about and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s still the best. The simplest explanation is that it features the funniest straight men Triumph&#x27;s ever encountered. So you&#x27;re laughing not only at the jokes but the faces, the costumes and committment [sic]. There&#x27;s so much to enjoy.&quot;

=== Space Ghost Coast to Coast ===
In 2004, Triumph appeared as the guest star on the hit Adult Swim series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; in the episode &quot;Dreams&quot;. Triumph offhandedly mentions having anal sex with Lassie, which causes friction between Space Ghost and Moltar over such topics being brought up on television.

=== MTV Video Music Awards and incident with Eminem ===

In 2001 and 2002, Triumph appeared in the audience at the MTV Video Music Awards. In 2001, Triumph interviewed Carson Daly before spotting Jennifer Lopez and asking if he could sniff her butt.

In 2002, Triumph interviewed Moby before spotting Eminem, who covered Triumph with his hand, saying &quot;I already got my TV time&quot;. Triumph was then shoved away by Eminem&#x27;s bodyguards. The following day, Triumph appeared on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; and gave a press conference about the incident while wearing a neck brace. Triumph later appeared in Eminem&#x27;s music video for &quot;Ass Like That&quot;, and at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, Eminem began his performance by voicing a lookalike puppet.

=== 2004 presidential campaign ===

Triumph filmed a number of segments during the 2004 US presidential election cycle. In November 2003, in the early days of the 2004 U.S. presidential primary campaign, Triumph was the &quot;lead guest&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; the same night that Democratic candidate John Kerry also appeared on the show. Kerry made a dramatic entry, riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage; but Triumph, in characteristic style, poked fun at him with a series of scathingly rude remarks, to Kerry&#x27;s evident discomfort. (Among his jibes: &quot;The poop I made in the dressing room had more heat than John Kerry!&quot;)

In July and August 2004, Triumph followed up with visits to both major parties&#x27; national conventions. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston (from which he was ejected), Triumph and Michael Moore attempted to crash Bill O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s set. O&#x27;Reilly, having his makeup applied at the time, shouted, &quot;If I have to come out there, Insult Dog, you&#x27;re gonna be talking a lot higher than you are now.&quot; He also gained entry to the Republican convention in New York, and even debated actor Ron Silver during the wrap-up on MSNBC.

=== 2008 presidential election ===

In September 2008, Triumph traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota to attend that year&#x27;s Republican National Convention, where he filed a series of reports as he joked around with delegates inside the hall and protesters in the streets outside the convention. He also conducted a -minute interview (at a hotel across the street) with independent candidate Ralph Nader.

In October 2008, Triumph made an appearance at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York during the final presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama. He interviewed and made jokes with political party supporters and with other members of the press, including the host of Fox News Channel&#x27;s &quot;On the Record with Greta Van Susteren&quot;, making a surprise appearance on her show with Mr. Met, the mascot of the New York Mets.

=== &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot; ===

Triumph was a main character in the short-lived Adult Swim series &quot;The Jack and Triumph Show&quot; with Jack McBrayer and June Squibb. It premiered on February 20, 2015, and lasted until April 3, 2015.

=== 2016 and 2020 presidential elections ===

In February 2016, Triumph starred in &quot;Triumph&#x27;s Election Special 2016&quot;, sponsored by Hulu and Funny or Die, traveling on the election trail. The program was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special. In November 2016, after the election of Donald Trump as president, Triumph appeared on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; to discuss Trump&#x27;s victory. In November 2018, Triumph covered the Texas Senate campaign between Ted Cruz and Beto O&#x27;Rourke for &quot;The Late Show&quot;. In February 2020, Triumph appeared on &quot;The Late Show&quot; to attempt to interview congresspeople during the first Trump impeachment trial. After holding up a sign behind Senator Lindsey Graham during a CNN interview, he was escorted out of the building before finishing the segment outside.

=== 2022 U.S. Capitol arrest ===
In June 2022, Smigel and six staffers from &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; were arrested by the United States Capitol Police for an alleged unlawful entry in the Longworth House Office Building while filming a segment with Triumph during the January 6 attack hearings.

=== 2024 election ===
In October 2024, Smigel appeared in the background of multiple crowd shots during the vice-presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance. Two Triumph puppets were in use, dressed as Vance’s grandmother and WWE star Hulk Hogan. They were briefly interviewed by CNN’s Jake Tapper before the broadcast ended.

On October 27, 2024, Triumph interviewed attendees waiting to attend a Donald Trump rally at Madison Square Garden. At one point, he dons face paint and Viking horns to resemble Jacob Chansley. Triumph caps the segment with a crowd song parodying conservative sentiments.

Both incidents aired as correspondent pieces for &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.

Triumph reappeared at the People&#x27;s March in Washington, DC in January 2025.

== Trademark lawsuit ==

In 1999, after Triumph accused Pets.com&#x27;s sock puppet mascot of being a &quot;rip-off&quot; of Triumph on television shows, in print media, online, and in a letter, the company sent lawsuit threats and cease and desist letters to Smigel claiming &quot;unfair competition, dilution and potentially tortious interference with contract in violation of federal and state laws&quot; and the following year filed a lawsuit against &quot;Late Night&quot; and Smigel. The bankruptcy and closing of the company during the dot-com bust of 2000 ended the lawsuit. Triumph humped the Pets.com dog in a bathroom during a segment of &quot;Late Night&quot; as an act of revenge.

== Discography ==

Triumph&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Come Poop with Me&quot;, was released by Warner Bros. Records, and featured adult comedy and songs, plus a bonus DVD of live performances by Triumph. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Appearing with Triumph on the album and the DVD were singer-actor Jack Black, comic actor Adam Sandler, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast members Maya Rudolph and Horatio Sanz; Blackwolf the Dragonmaster from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; skit; and Conan O&#x27;Brien. Notable songs include &quot;I Keed&quot;, &quot;Underage Bichon&quot;, &quot;Lick Myself&quot; and &quot;Cats are Cunts&quot;.

On August 10, 2004, NBC released a DVD, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien: The Best of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog&quot; featuring select Triumph appearances from &quot;Late Night&quot;.

<text>Transplant rejection occurs when transplanted tissue is rejected by the recipient&#x27;s immune system, which destroys the transplanted tissue. Transplant rejection can be lessened by determining the molecular similitude between donor and recipient and by use of immunosuppressant drugs after transplant.

==Types==
Transplant rejection can be classified into three types: hyperacute, acute, and chronic. These types are differentiated by how quickly the recipient&#x27;s immune system is activated and the specific aspect or aspects of immunity involved.

===Hyperacute rejection===

Hyperacute rejection is a form of rejection that manifests itself in the minutes to hours following transplantation. It is caused by the presence of pre-existing antibodies in the recipient that recognize antigens in the donor organ. These antigens are located on the endothelial lining of blood vessels within the transplanted organ and, once antibodies bind, will lead to the rapid activation of the complement system. Irreversible damage via thrombosis and subsequent graft necrosis is to be expected. Tissue left implanted will fail to work and could lead to high fever and malaise as the immune system acts against foreign tissue.

Graft failure secondary to hyperacute rejection has significantly decreased in incidence as a result of improved pre-transplant screening for antibodies to donor tissues. While these preformed antibodies may result from prior transplants, prior blood transfusions, or pregnancy, hyperacute rejection is most commonly from antibodies to ABO blood group antigens. Consequently, transplants between individuals with differing ABO blood types is generally avoided though may be pursued in very young children (generally under 12 months, but often as old as 24 months) who do not have fully developed immune systems. Shortages of organs and the morbidity and mortality associated with being on transplant waitlists has also increased interest in ABO-incompatible transplantation in older children and adults.

===Acute rejection===

Acute rejection is a category of rejection that occurs on the timescale of weeks to months, with most episodes occurring within the first 3 months to 1 year after transplantation. Unlike hyperacute rejection, acute rejection is thought to arise from two distinct immunological mechanisms as lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells, begin to recognize antigens on transplanted organ/graft. This recognition occurs due to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which are proteins on cell surface that are presented to the T-cell receptor found on T-cells. In humans, this is known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system and over 17,000 HLA alleles or genetic variants have been described such that it is extremely uncommon for any two people to have identical alleles. Other non-HLA proteins, known as minor histocompatibility antigens, do exist but generally are unable to cause acute rejection in and of themselves unless a multitude of non-HLA proteins are mismatched. As such, HLA matching (in addition to matching ABO groups) is critical in preventing acute rejection.

This process of recognition by T-cells can happen directly or indirectly and lead to acute cellular and acute humoral rejection respectively. Direct allorecognition is a phenomenon within transplant immunology where the dendritic cells, which are the body&#x27;s antigen-presenting cells (APCs), migrate from &quot;donor&quot; tissue to lymphoid tissue (lymphoid follicles and lymph nodes) in the &quot;recipient&quot; and present their MHC peptides to recipient lymphocytes. In comparison, indirect allorecognition is more analogous to how foreign antigens are recognized by the immune system. Dendritic cells of the &quot;recipient&quot; come across peptides from donor tissue whether in circulation, lymphoid tissue, or in donor tissue itself. Since not the result of direct antigen presentation, these may not necessarily be intact MHC molecules but instead other proteins that are deemed different enough from recipient may engender a response. This process leads to the priming of T-cells to respond to the peptides secondarily going forward. A third semi-direct pathway has been described in which recipient APCs present fully intact donor MHCs, yet its relative contribution to acute rejection is not as well understood.

Acute cellular rejection occurs following direct allorecognition of mismatched donor MHC by cytotoxic T-cells that begin to secrete cytokines to recruit more lymphocytes as well as cause apoptosis or cell death directly. The greater the difference in MHC between donor and recipient, the more cytotoxic T-cells are recruited to damage the graft, which may be seen via biopsy in solid organ transplants, with increased lymphocyte infiltration indicative of more severe acute cellular rejection. Acute humoral rejection is a process usually initiated by indirect allorecognition arising from recipient helper T-cells. These helper T-cells have a crucial role in the development of B-cells that can create donor-specific antibodies. The antibodies deposit themselves within the donor graft and lead to activation of the complement cascade alongside antibody-mediated cytotoxicity with neutrophils, a type of white blood cell separate from lymphocytes, predominantly infiltrating into tissues.

Barring genetically identical twins, acute rejection is to be expected to some degree. Rates of clinically significant acute rejection that could endanger transplant have decreased significantly with the development of immunosuppressive regimens. Using kidney transplants as an example, rates of acute rejection have declined from &gt;50% in the 1970s to 10-20%. Singular episodes of acute rejection, when promptly treated, should not compromise transplant; however, repeated episodes may lead to chronic rejection. 
===Chronic rejection===

Chronic rejection is an insidious form of rejection that leads to graft destruction over the course of months, but most often years after tissue transplantation. The mechanism for chronic rejection is yet to be fully understood, but it is known that prior acute rejection episodes are the main clinical predictor for the development of chronic rejection. In particular, the incidence increases following severe or persistent acute rejection, whereas acute rejection episodes with return to function back to baseline do not have major effects on graft survival. Chronic rejection is generally thought of as being related to either vascular damage or parenchymal damage with subsequent fibrosis. While it is unknown the exact contribution of the immune system in these processes, the indirect pathway of allorecognition and the associated antibody formation seems to be especially involved.

Chronic rejection has widely varied effects on different organs. At 5 years post-transplant, 80% of lung transplants, 60% of heart transplants and 50% of kidney transplants are affected, while liver transplants are only affected 10% of the time. Therefore, chronic rejection explains long-term morbidity in most lung-transplant recipients, the median survival roughly 4.7 years, about half the span versus other major organ transplants. Airflow obstruction not ascribable to other cause is labeled bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), confirmed by a persistent drop—three or more weeks—in &quot;forced expiratory volume&quot; (FEV1) by at least 20%. First noted is infiltration by lymphocytes, followed by epithelial cell injury, then inflammatory lesions and recruitment of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which proliferate and secrete proteins forming scar tissue. A similar phenomenon can be seen with liver transplant wherein fibrosis leads to jaundice secondary to the destruction of bile ducts within the liver, also known as vanishing bile duct syndrome.

== Rejection due to non-adherence ==
One principal reason for transplant rejection is non-adherence to prescribed immunosuppressant regimens. This is particularly the case with adolescent recipients, with non-adherence rates near 50% in some instances.

A pilot study conducted by Michael O. Killian PhD from Florida State University and Dr. Dipankar Gupta from University of Florida published in April 2022 in &quot;Pediatric Transplantation&quot; studied the acceptability and feasibility of an asynchronous directly observed therapy mobile health application among adolescent heart transplant recipients. Patients in the study utilized emocha Health&#x27;s digital medication adherence program which included asynchronous video messages and chat messages exchanged with a care team. Patients completing the study achieved a 90.1% adherence rate. The researchers noted that further randomized trials are required to confirm the initial findings. However, the results were very promising considering few options exist to support pediatric patients in taking their medications.

==Rejection detection==
Diagnosis of acute rejection relies on clinical data—patient signs and symptoms but also calls on laboratory data such as blood or even tissue biopsy. The laboratory pathologist generally seeks three main histological signs: (1) infiltrating T cells, perhaps accompanied by infiltrating eosinophils, plasma cells, and neutrophils, particularly in telltale ratios, (2) structural compromise of tissue anatomy, varying by tissue type transplanted, and (3) injury to blood vessels. Tissue biopsy is restricted, however, by sampling limitations and risks/complications of the invasive procedure. Cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of immune cells radiolabeled &quot;in vivo&quot; might—similarly to Gene Expression Profiling (GEP)—offer noninvasive testing.

==Rejection treatment==

Hyperacute rejection manifests severely and within minutes, and so treatment is immediate: removal of the tissue. Acute rejection is treated with one or several of a few strategies. Despite treatment, rejection remains a major cause of transplant failure. Chronic rejection is generally considered irreversible and poorly amenable to treatment—only retransplant generally indicated if feasible—though inhaled ciclosporin is being investigated to delay or prevent chronic rejection of lung transplants.

===Immunosuppressive therapy===

A short course of high-dose corticosteroids can be applied, and repeated. &quot;Triple therapy&quot; adds a calcineurin inhibitor and an anti-proliferative agent. Where calcineurin inhibitors or steroids are contraindicated, mTOR inhibitors are used.

Immunosuppressive drugs:
* Corticosteroids
** Prednisolone
** Hydrocortisone
* Calcineurin inhibitors
** Ciclosporin
** Tacrolimus
* Anti-proliferatives
** Azathioprine
** Mycophenolic acid
* mTOR inhibitors
** Sirolimus
** Everolimus

===Antibody-based treatments===

Antibody specific to select immune components can be added to immunosuppressive therapy. The monoclonal anti-T cell antibody OKT3, once used to prevent rejection, and still occasionally used to treat severe acute rejection, has fallen into disfavor, as it commonly brings severe cytokine release syndrome and late post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. (OKT3 is available in the United Kingdom for named-patient use only.)

Antibody drugs:
* Monoclonal anti-IL-2Rα receptor antibodies
** Basiliximab
** Daclizumab
* Monoclonal anti-IL-6R receptor antibodies
** Tocilizumab
* Polyclonal anti-T-cell antibodies
** Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)
** Anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG)
* Monoclonal anti-CD20 antibodies
** Rituximab

===Blood transfer===

Cases refractory to immunosuppressive or antibody therapy are sometimes treated with photopheresis, or extracorporeal photoimmune therapy (ECP), to remove antibody molecules specific to the transplanted tissue.

===Marrow transplant===

Bone marrow transplant can replace the transplant recipient&#x27;s immune system with the donor&#x27;s, and the recipient accepts the new organ without rejection. The marrow&#x27;s hematopoietic stem cells—the reservoir of stem cells replenishing exhausted blood cells including white blood cells forming the immune system—must be of the individual who donated the organ or of an identical twin or a clone. There is a risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), however, whereby mature lymphocytes entering with marrow recognize the new host tissues as foreign and destroy them.

===Gene therapy===
Gene therapy is another method that can be used. In this method, the genes that cause the body to reject transplants would be deactivated. Research is still being conducted, and no gene therapies are being used to date to treat patients. Current research tends to focus on Th1 and Th17 which mediate allograft rejection via the CD4 and CD8 T cells.

<doc id="529589" wikidata="Q849318" url="?curid=529589" title="Revillagigedo Islands">
<text>The Revillagigedo Islands (, ) or Revillagigedo Archipelago are a group of four volcanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, known for their unique ecosystem. They lie approximately from Socorro Island south and southwest of Cabo San Lucas, the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and west of Manzanillo. Historically linked to the Mexican state of Colima, to which they were granted in 1861 to establish a penal colony, the islands are under Mexican federal property and jurisdiction.

In July 2016, the Revillagigedo Archipelago was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in November 2017 they were declared to be a marine reserve and a national park of Mexico. Some of the volcanoes are active, with the last eruption of Volcán Bárcena in 1953, and Socorro in 1993. Travelling to the islands from their nearest land point takes approximately 26 to 30 hours, as they are typically reached by sea; a small military airstrip exists on Socorro.

==Geography==

The total area is 157.81 km2 (60.93 mi2), spread over an east-to-west extent of about 420 km (261 mi). A naval station in the south of Socorro Island has a population of 45 (staff). On Clarión is a small naval garrison with nine men. The islands are otherwise uninhabited. The islands are named after Don Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, the 53rd viceroy of New Spain.
The three eastern islands are called the inner islands. They fall in the time zone UTC-7 (Mountain Time), while the major part of Colima is UTC-6 (Central Time Zone). Clarión is comparatively far to the west, by more than 200 km in comparison with the inner islands, and in UTC-8 (Pacific Time Zone). The Revillagigedo Islands are one of three Mexican island groups in the Pacific Ocean that are not on the continental shelf; the others are Guadalupe Island and Rocas Alijos.

==History==

===Sixteenth to nineteenth century===

No evidence of human habitation on any of the islands exists before their discovery by Spanish explorers. Hernando de Grijalva and his crew discovered an uninhabited island on 19 December 1533, and named it &quot;Santo Tomás&quot; (Socorro Island) and on 28 December they discovered &quot;Isla de los Inocentes&quot; (San Benedicto) which owed its name to having been found on the day of the Holy Innocents.

In November 1542, Ruy López de Villalobos, while exploring new routes across the Pacific, rediscovered &quot;Inocentes&quot; and &quot;Santo Tomás&quot; and charted the latter as &quot;Anublada&quot; (&quot;Cloudy&quot;). Villalobos was the first to report sighting of Roca Partida Island giving it its present-day name. In 1608, Martín Yánez de Armida, in charge of another expedition, visited &quot;Anublada&quot; and changed its name to Socorro. In 1779 José Camacho was the first to report sighting of the island remaining, that he charted as &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; (&quot;Saint Rose&quot;). &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; was later renamed &quot;Clarion&quot; after the vessel commanded by Henry Gyzelaar at that time.

The Revillagigedo Islands have been visited by a number of other explorers: Domingo del Castillo (1541), Miguel Pinto (1772), Alexander von Humboldt (1811), Benjamin Morrell (1825), Sir Edward Belcher (1839) who made the first botanical collections and Reeve, who witnessed the eruption of Mount Evermann in 1848. On 25 July 1861, President Benito Juárez signed a decree awarding territorial control over the four islands to the state of Colima. His plan was to build an offshore penitentiary on Isla Socorro; although this never happened, the decree whereby they were attached to Colima has never been repealed. In 1865, the island was explored by ornithologist Andrew Jackson Grayson, who discovered the Socorro dove, Socorro mockingbird and the Socorro elf owl which were later given scientific names in his honor.

===Twentieth century===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, Dr. Barton Warren Evermann, director of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California, promoted the scientific exploration of the islands. The most comprehensive biological collections were obtained at this time. The volcano on Isla Socorro was renamed in his honor. In 1957 the Mexican Navy established a naval base on Socorro and has had a permanent presence on the island since then. A tiny outpost also exists on Clarión, as noted above. On 21 March 1972, became the first Governor of Colima to visit his state&#x27;s island territories. A plaque was unveiled to mark the event and cement Colima&#x27;s claim.

The seas surrounding the larger islands are popular with scuba divers; a variety of marine life such as cetaceans, sharks and manta rays can be observed. Visitors usually stay aboard expedition vessels during their visit to the islands, which is desirable from an ecological standpoint to prevent introduction of further invasive species. The islands are considered dangerous to visit for purposes beyond diving since it is difficult to make a landing; some have nearly lost their lives attempting to do so on Clarion for example.

They are occasionally visited by amateur radio operators, who usually use the ITU prefix XF4. Because of their distance from the mainland, for award credit they are considered to be an &quot;entity&quot; separate from Mexico. Expeditions from organizations engaged in biological conservation of the islands visit the islands for fieldwork on a regular basis. No tourism facilities exist; the islands have no reliable sources of fresh water of their own.

===Twenty-first century===
On 24 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto created North America&#x27;s largest marine protected area around the Revillagigedo Islands. This protected area covers around the islands, and bans fishing, mining, and tourism development in the protected area and on the islands.

==Ecology==
The Revillagigedo Islands are home to many endemic plant and animal species, and are sometimes called Mexico&#x27;s &quot;little Hawaii&quot;. They are recognized as a distinct terrestrial ecoregion, part of the Neotropical realm. Socorro is the most diverse in flora, fauna, and topography. The Mexican Government established the islands as a Biosphere Reserve on June 4, 1994. &quot;Oceanographic Magazine&quot; stated in 2020 that, &quot;Its remoteness, protection and peculiar oceanography makes it one of the most biodiverse and exciting marine destinations on earth.&quot;

The islands are mostly covered with tropical dry forest, with several distinct plant communities that vary with elevation, soils, and exposure. Hopbush (&quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot;) and &quot;Guettarda insularis&quot; are common dry forest species. Green buttonwood mangrove (&quot;Conocarpus erectus&quot;) and the shrub &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot; subsp. &quot;pernambucensis&quot; grow along the seacoast.

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 14 of the islands&#x27; 16 generally accepted resident taxa of landbirds are endemic, and include the Clarión wren (&quot;Troglodytes tanneri&quot;), Socorro wren (&quot;Troglodytes sissonii&quot;), Socorro mockingbird (&quot;Mimus graysoni&quot;), Socorro dove (&quot;Zenaida graysoni&quot;), and Socorro parakeet (&quot;Arahuga brevipes&quot;). Clarión is home to endemic subspecies of burrowing owl (&quot;Athene cunicularia rostrata&quot;), mourning dove (&quot;Zenaida macroura clarionensis&quot;), and common raven (&quot;Corvus corax clarionensis&quot;). A variety of yellow-crowned night heron, &quot;Nyctanassa violacea bancrofti (gravirostris)&quot;, is endemic to Socorro. Townsend&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Puffinus auricularis&quot;) is a seabird that breeds only around Cerro Evermann on Socorro. It formerly bred on Clarión and San Benedicto, but has not bred on Clarión since 1988 nor on San Benedicto since 1952.

The islands&#x27; four native terrestrial vertebrates are all endemic, and include a whip snake (&quot;Masticophis anthonyi&quot;), a night snake (&quot;Hypsiglena unaocularis&quot;) and two iguanids (&quot;Urosaurus auriculatus&quot; and &quot;U. clarionensis&quot;). Numerous seabird taxa breed no further north(east)wards than San Benedicto; storm-petrels are notably absent as breeders though they breed in the region and visit the islands to forage. Albatrosses are also not normally found here. Among landbirds, the absence of the house finch, widespread on northeastern Pacific offshore islands, is the most conspicuous one.

Apart from the native birds, migrant shorebirds and others are often found on the islands. &quot;Bahia Azufre&quot; (Sulfur Bay) on Clarión seems to be a favorite stopover location, as it is one of the few longer stretches of beach in the islands; mostly, the shoreline is steep cliffs. The archipelago is also a part of wintering grounds for humpback whales in the North Pacific.

Socorro has numerous endemic plant taxa, whereas Clarión has only a few. The San Benedicto ecosystem was nearly wiped out in the devastating eruption of Bárcena volcano on August 1, 1952. The ecosystem there has since recovered, but the event is known to have caused the extinction of the San Benedicto rock wren. Most if not all native plants found on San Benedicto today are shared with Clarión, but not with the closer Socorro to the south, due to the prevailing winds and ocean currents. The native flora of Clarión is about equally shared with both other large islands.

As opposed to the interchange between the islands, the animals and plants that colonized them initially are apparently all from mainland populations generally to the northeastward of the Revillagigedos. Plants are most often derived from Baja California founder populations, whereas the endemic nonavian reptiles seem to be rather derived directly from mainland populations of the Sonora-Sinaloa area. The ancestors of the islands&#x27; terrestrial birds probably came from the general area of southern North and northern Central America. As illustrated by the fact that no endemic landbird taxon occurs on more than one island and the cases of the Socorro and Clarión wrens as well as the Socorro dove and Clarión mourning dove, each bird population seems to have arisen independently. The archipelago has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for its breeding seabirds and endemic landbirds.

&quot;Ilex socorroensis&quot;, &quot;Aristolochia socorroensis&quot;, &quot;Bidens socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Coreocarpus insularis&quot;, &quot;Eremosis littoralis&quot;, &quot;Erigeron socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Perityle socorrosensis&quot;, &quot;Zapoteca formosa&quot; subsp. &quot;socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Lepechinia hastata&quot; subsp. &quot;socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Salvia pseudomisella&quot;, &quot;Triumfetta socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Botrychium socorrense&quot;, &quot;Acianthera unguicallosa&quot;, &quot;Castilleja bryantii&quot; var. &quot;socorrensis&quot;, &quot;Peperomia socorronis&quot;, &quot;Muhlenbergia solisii&quot;, &quot;Paspalum longum&quot;, &quot;Guettarda insularis&quot;, &quot;Meliosma nesites&quot;, &quot;Cestrum pacificum&quot;, &quot;Physalis mimulus&quot;, &quot;Citharexylum danirae&quot;, and &quot;Verbena sphaerocarpa&quot; are endemic to Socorro. &quot;Portulaca masonii&quot; is endemic to Clarión. &quot;Aristolochia islandica&quot; and &quot;Erigeron crenatus&quot; are endemic to San Benedicto. Plants endemic to two or more islands include &quot;Cryptantha foliosa&quot;, &quot;Bulbostylis nesiotica&quot;, &quot;Cyperus duripes&quot;, &quot;Croton masonii&quot;, &quot;Teucrium townsendii&quot;, &quot;Oenothera resicum&quot;, &quot;Aristida tenuifolia&quot;, &quot;Aristida vaginata&quot;, &quot;Spermacoce nesiotica&quot;, and &quot;Nicotiana stocktonii&quot;.

===Threats and conservation===

As late as 1956, it was said that:
&quot;The future of the avifauna of the islands appears to be secure at present. There are no human inhabitants, and no mammals of any kind except the moderate and apparently stable population of sheep on Socorro.&quot;
But the unique ecology of the islands has since then come under threat from introduced species. The sheep were introduced to Socorro in 1869. Cats became established after 1953, probably in the early 1970s. Pigs were introduced to Clarión in 1979, and rabbits became feral at some earlier date.

Several endemic species of Socorro are now threatened with extinction. The Socorro mockingbird (&quot;Mimodes graysoni&quot;) numbers less than 400 individuals altogether. The endemic Socorro parakeet (&quot;Psittacara brevipes&quot;) and Townsend&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Puffinus auricularis&quot;), are also endangered. The Socorro dove (&quot;Zenaida graysoni&quot;) is now extinct in the wild, but is being bred in captivity. The elf owl&#x27;s Socorro subspecies &quot;Micrathene whitneyi graysoni&quot; appears to be extinct. Other plant and animal taxa in the archipelago are also considered threatened or nearly so.

A number of conservation initiatives are dedicated to halting the destruction of the native ecosystems of the islands. Dr. Harmunt Walter of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and Dr. Luis F. Baptista of the California Academy of Sciences have coordinated breeding and reintroduction efforts for the Socorro dove since 1988, through the Island Endemics Institute. The &quot;Comité Científico para la Conservación y Restauración del Archipiélago Revillagigedo&quot; (&quot;Scientific Committee for the Conservation and Restoration of the Revillagigedo Islands&quot;) was founded in 1996, and is a committee representing several organizations, including the Island Conservation &amp; Ecology Group, Island Endemics Institute, the University of Missouri–St. Louis (UMSL), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and others. It is chaired by Dr. Walter and Dr. Luis Medrano of UNAM is its secretary. The committee has been advocating removal of the exotic species from the islands, especially the estimated 2000 sheep on Socorro, to allow the islands&#x27; ecology to recover, and adoption of a management plan to promote the recovery of the islands&#x27; native species, including reintroduction of the Socorro dove.

Brattstrom and Howell who gave the optimistic outlook in 1956 went on to caution:
&quot;it may be hoped that the Mexican government will guard against the introduction of mammals such as rabbits, cats, goats and others that have invariably brought disaster to the flora and fauna of insular regions.&quot;
===Marine protected area===
On 25 November 2017, President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto acted to protect the biodiversity of the region by creating North America&#x27;s largest marine protected area around the islands, and prohibiting mining, fishing, and tourism development on or near the islands. In total, marine protected areas cover 4.6% of Mexico&#x27;s exclusive economic zone for fishing. Marine protected areas have been shown to positively contribute to ocean diversity, improve nearby fishing locations, and combat climate change. A study published five years after the establishment of the marine protected area found that fishing activity within the protected zone had decreased by an average of 82% per vessel. The study also found that industrial fishing catches in Mexico&#x27;s exclusive economic zone had not decreased.

<text>Fritz Wolfgang London (March 7, 1900 – March 30, 1954) was a German born physicist and professor at Duke University. His fundamental contributions to the theories of chemical bonding and of intermolecular forces (London dispersion forces) are today considered classic and are discussed in standard textbooks of physical chemistry. With his brother Heinz London, he made a significant contribution to understanding electromagnetic properties of superconductors with the London equations and was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on five separate occasions.

==Biography==
London was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wrocław, Poland) as the son of Franz London (1863-1917). Being a Jew, London lost his position at the University of Berlin after Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party passed the 1933 racial laws. He took visiting positions in England and France, and emigrated to the United States in 1939, of which he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Later in his life, London was a professor at Duke University. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1953. He died from a heart ailment in Durham, North Carolina, in 1954.

==Academic achievements==
London&#x27;s early work with Walter Heitler on chemical bonding is now treated in any textbook on physical chemistry. This paper was the first to properly explain the bonding in a homonuclear molecule such as H2. It is no coincidence that the Heitler–London work appeared shortly after the introduction of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg and Schrödinger, because quantum mechanics was crucial in their explanation of the covalent bond. Another necessary ingredient was the realization that electrons are indistinguishable, as expressed in the Pauli principle.

Other early work of London was in the area of intermolecular forces. He coined the expression &quot;dispersion effect&quot; for the attraction between two rare gas atoms at large (say about 1 nanometer) distance from each other. Nowadays this attraction is often referred to as &quot;London force&quot;. In 1930 he gave (together with R. Eisenschitz) a unified treatment of the interaction between two noble gas atoms that attract each other at large distance, but repel each other at short distances. Eisenschitz and London showed that this repulsion is a consequence of enforcing the electronic wavefunction to be antisymmetric under electron permutations. This antisymmetry is required by the Pauli principle and the fact that electrons are fermions.

For atoms and nonpolar molecules, the London dispersion force is the only intermolecular force, and is responsible for their existence in liquid and solid states. For polar molecules, this force is one part of the van der Waals force, along with forces between the permanent molecular dipole moments.

London was the first theoretical physicist to make the fundamental, and at the time controversial, suggestion that superfluidity is intrinsically related to the Einstein condensation of bosons, a phenomenon now known as Bose–Einstein condensation. Bose recognized that the statistics of massless photons could also be applied to massive particles; he did not contribute to the theory of the condensation of bosons.

London was also one of the early authors (including Schrödinger) to have properly understood the principle of local gauge invariance (Weyl) in the context of the then new quantum mechanics.

London predicted the effect of flux quantization in superconductors and with his brother Heinz postulated that the electrodynamics of superconductors is described by a massive field. I.e. that whilst magnetic flux is expelled from a superconductor, this happens exponentially over a finite length with an exponent which is now called the London penetration depth.

London also developed a theory of a rotational response of a superconductor, pointing out that rotation of a superconductor generates magnetic field London moment. This effect is used in models of rotational dynamics of neutron stars.

==Fritz London Memorial Lectures and Prize==

Since 1956, the Fritz London Memorial Lectures have brought to the scientific community at Duke University a distinguished group of lecturers including twenty Nobel laureates. The scientific interests of each lecturer impinge at one or more points upon the various fields of physics and chemistry to which Fritz London contributed. In December 1972, John Bardeen, two-time winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, established an endowment fund &quot;to perpetuate the memory of Fritz London, distinguished scientist and member of the Duke faculty from 1939 to the time of his death in 1954, and to promote research and understanding of Physics at Duke University and in the wider scientific community&quot;. The fund is to be used to underwrite the Fritz London Memorial Prize, given in recognition of outstanding contributions in Low Temperature Physics, and provide support for the London Memorial Lectures at Duke University.

<text>The Congress of Soviets was the supreme governing body of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and several other Soviet republics and national autonomies in the Soviet Russia and soviet Union from 1917 to 1936 and a somewhat similar Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies from 1989 to 1991. After the creation of the Soviet Union, the Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union functioned as its legislative branch until its dissolution in 1936. Its initial full name was the &quot;Congress of Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies&quot;. It was also sometimes known as the &quot;Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies.&quot; A similar name also applied in communist-held China in the Republican era.

==Russia and the Soviet Union ==

The Congress of Soviets was an assembly of representatives of local councils. In theory, it was the supreme power of the Soviet State, an organ of the dictatorship of the proletariat. No bourgeois, no noble, no aristocrat, no priest could vote – only working people. Officially, the Congress of Soviets created laws and elected the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, which was the government. In the interim its functions were performed by designated executive bodies, titled Central Executive Committees, such as the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in Russia. In practice the Congresses became increasingly deferential to the Bolsheviks after the Russian Revolution.

By the time of Lenin&#x27;s death in 1924 the Congress of Soviets effectively only rubber-stamped the decisions of the Communist Party and served as a propaganda tribune. The 1936 Constitution eliminated the Congress of Soviets, making the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union its highest legislative institution. During this time the Central Committee of the AUCP(b) held de facto control over the government.
* Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets December 29, 1920

==Ukraine==

The Bolsheviks convened an All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies in Kyiv, on December 17, 1917, and in Kharkiv on December 25, 1917.

==China==
The Chinese Communist Party had convened the National Congress of Chinese Soviets of Workers&#x27;, Soldiers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Deputies in Ruijin, a city in Jiangxi Province on November 7, 1931. The National Congress of Chinese Soviets is the forerunner to the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

<doc id="529595" wikidata="Q316712" url="?curid=529595" title="Patrick Duffy">
<text>Patrick Duffy (born March 17, 1949) is an American actor and director widely known for his role as Bobby Ewing on the CBS primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978–1991). Duffy returned to reprise his role as Bobby in a continuation of &quot;Dallas&quot;, which aired on TNT from 2012 to 2014. He is also well known for his role on the ABC sitcom &quot;Step by Step&quot; as Frank Lambert from 1991 to 1998, and for his role as Stephen Logan on the CBS daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (2006–2011, 2022, 2023). Duffy played the lead character&#x27;s father in the 2014 NBC sitcom &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot;.

== Early life ==
Duffy was born in Townsend, Montana, in 1949, the son of tavern owners, Patrick Mor Terence and Marie Duffy (née Dawson). Duffy is of Irish ancestry. During high school, Duffy was living in Everett, Washington, and attended Cascade High School. At Cascade, he participated in the Drama Club and the Pep Club, for which he was a Yell King. Academically, Duffy graduated from the University of Washington in 1971 with a degree in drama. He ruptured both his vocal cords during his senior year of college, but , where he worked as an interpreter for ballet, opera, and orchestra companies in Washington. He also taught mime and movement classes during this period. In a 2021 interview with David A. Weiner, Duffy credits his sister, an international champion diver, with teaching him the necessary swimming techniques for his first career break. She became a police officer in Seattle.

== Career ==

Duffy appeared in a Taco Bell commercial in the early 1970s, playing an employee describing an Enchirito. In 1977, he landed the role of Mark Harris in the short-lived television series &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot;. Following the series&#x27; cancellation in early 1978, he got his big break in the role of Bobby Ewing, opposite Barbara Bel Geddes and Larry Hagman, on the prime-time soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;. The show became a worldwide success. Despite its success, Duffy opted to leave the series in 1985 with his character being killed off onscreen. However, with both the show and his career on the decline, he returned in 1986 in the famous shower scene that rendered the entire 1985–1986 season &quot;just a dream.&quot; Duffy then remained with the series until its cancellation in 1991. He also appeared in several episodes of the spin-off series &quot;Knots Landing&quot; between 1979 and 1982. Throughout the 13-year run of &quot;Dallas&quot;, Duffy directed several episodes of the series. 
Along with &quot;Dallas&quot; fame, Duffy has also tried his hand at singing, and in 1983, he had a hit in Europe with &quot;Together We&#x27;re Strong&quot;, a duet with French female singer Mireille Mathieu. The single reached No. 5 in the Netherlands in April 1983.

At the end of &quot;Dallas&quot;″ run in 1991, Duffy began another television role, as Frank Lambert on the family sitcom, &quot;Step by Step&quot; in which he co-starred with Suzanne Somers. The series ran until 1998, and Duffy also directed numerous episodes. Also in the 1990s, he appeared in two &quot;Dallas&quot; reunion television films; &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;&quot; (1998), both of which he also co-produced. He has reunited on several occasions with many of his &quot;Dallas&quot; co-stars both onscreen and off, most notably for the non-fiction television special &quot;Dallas Reunion: Return to Southfork&quot; in 2004. Duffy later continued to act in occasional guest or voice acting appearances, including the series &quot;Family Guy&quot; (in which he appeared in a live action scene with Victoria Principal as they spoofed the &quot;Dallas&quot; shower scene), as well as &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. Duffy starred in the television films &quot;Falling in Love With the Girl Next Door&quot; and &quot;Desolation Canyon&quot;. In 2006, he began a recurring role on the daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; as Stephen Logan. From April to July 2008, he hosted &quot;Bingo America&quot;, a partially interactive game show on GSN.

Duffy reprised his role as Bobby Ewing in TNT&#x27;s continuation series of &quot;Dallas&quot;. The series aired from 2012 to 2014.

Duffy played a surreal double of Bobby Ewing in the experimental documentary &quot;Hotel Dallas&quot;, directed by artist duo Ungur &amp; Huang. The film premiered at the 2016 Berlin International Film Festival.

== Personal life ==
Duffy married Carlyn Rosser, a professional ballerina 13 years his senior, in 1974. She danced with the First Chamber Dance Company of New York. Her nephew is former Major League Baseball pitcher Barry Zito. The Duffys lived near Eagle Point, Oregon, with their sons Padraic (b. 1974) and Conor (born c. 1980). 

Introduced to Buddhism by his wife, Duffy converted to Nichiren Buddhism and began chanting Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō. He and his family are longtime members of the Buddhist organization Soka Gakkai International.

On November 18, 1986, Duffy&#x27;s parents were murdered at their tavern in Boulder, Montana by two young men, Kenneth Miller and Sean Wentz, during an armed robbery. Wentz and Miller, who were teenagers at the time, were convicted of the murders and sentenced to 75 years in prison. In 2001, Miller appeared before the Montana Parole board after Wentz recanted his original story and admitted that he, Wentz, was the sole gunman. Miller was denied clemency in 2001 but was released on parole in December 2007. Wentz was granted parole in 2015.

Duffy&#x27;s wife Carlyn Rosser died in 2017. In 2020, he entered into a relationship with actress Linda Purl.

<text>Bennington College is a private liberal arts college in Bennington, Vermont, United States. Founded as a women’s college in 1932, it became co-educational in 1969. It is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

==History==

===1920s===

The planning for the establishment of Bennington College began in 1924 and took nine years to be realized. While many people were involved, the four central figures in the founding of Bennington were Vincent Ravi Booth, Mr. and Mrs. Hall Park McCullough, and William Heard Kilpatrick.

A Women&#x27;s Committee, headed by Mrs. Hall Park McCullough, organized the Colony Club Meeting in 1924, which brought together some 500 civic leaders and educators from across the country. As a result of the Colony Club Meeting, a charter was secured and a board of trustees formed for Bennington College. One of the trustees, John Dewey, helped shape many of the college&#x27;s signature programs such as The Plan Process and Field Work Term through his educational principles.

In 1928, six years before the college would begin, Robert Devore Leigh was recruited by the Bennington College executive committee to serve as the first president of Bennington. Leigh presided over the forging of Bennington&#x27;s structure and its early operation. In 1929 Leigh authored the Bennington College Prospectus which outlined the &quot;Bennington idea&quot;.

===1930s===
The first class of eighty-seven women arrived on campus in 1932. The college was the first to include the visual and performing arts as full-fledged elements of the liberal arts curriculum. 

Every year since the college began in 1932, every Bennington College student has engaged in internships and volunteer opportunities each winter term. Originally called the Winter Field &amp; Reading Period, the two-month term was described by President Robert Devore Leigh in his 1928 Bennington College Prospectus as &quot;a long winter recess giving students and faculty opportunity for travel, field work, and educational advantages of metropolitan life&quot;. This internship was renamed twice, as Non-Resident term and, as it is called today, Field Work Term.

In 1934 the Bennington School of Dance summer program was founded by Martha Hill. Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, Hanya Holm, and Charles Weidman all taught at this laboratory. The program gained attendance by José Limón, Bessie Schonberg, Merce Cunningham, and Betty Ford. In 1935 the administration agreed to admit young men into the Bennington Theater Studio program, since men were needed for theatrical performances. Among the men who attended was the actor Alan Arkin.

Between 1935 and 1939 the famous social psychologist Theodore Newcomb conducted a study about the change of political attitude during the New Deal period.

President Leigh resigned in 1941, at the age of 50, saying he thought no college should be &quot;shackled by executive leadership gradually growing stale, feeble or lacking in initiative&quot;. He was succeeded by a member of the Bennington faculty, Dr. Lewis Webster Jones, economist and labor mediator.

===1940s–1980s===
In 1946, Paula Jean Welden, a sophomore at the college, disappeared while on a hike of the nearby Long Trail. She was living in Dewey House at the time and had traveled alone. Many students assisted in the search, but Paula was never found. Frederick H. Burkhardt, who had been ready to decline an invitation to become president of the college, visited the campus was impressed with the cohesion and support of the community in the face of this tragedy and accepted the offer. At age 35, he became the youngest college president in the nation.

In 1951 the U.S. State Department issued a documentary on Bennington highlighting its unique educational approach as a model for the Allied rebuilding of German society after the War.

The college continued to expand its physical infrastructure. Built in 1959, the Edward Clark Crossett Library was designed by the modernist architect Pietro Belluschi. After opening, Crossett Library was featured in &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; and became a focus of study for many architecture students in the 1960s. Crossett Library went on to win the 1963 Honor Award for library design. In 1968, three new student houses were completed to help house the growing student population and were named in honor of William C. Fels, Jessie Smith Noyes, and Margaret Smith Sawtell. These houses were designed by the distinguished modernist architect, Edward Larrabee Barnes, who posthumously earned the 2007 American Institute of Architects Gold Medal.

In 1969, Bennington became fully coeducational, a move that attracted major national attention, including a major feature story in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. The presidency of Gail Thain Parker from 1972 to 1976 was marked by controversy over curriculum reform, affirmative action, and relations between faculty and administration. 

===1990s===
In 1993, the Bennington College Board of Trustees initiated a process known as &quot;The Symposium&quot;. Arguing that the college suffered from &quot;a growing attachment to the status quo that, if unattended, is lethal to Bennington&#x27;s purpose and pedagogy&quot;, the board of trustees &quot;solicit[ed] ... concerns and proposals on a wide and open-ended range of issues from every member of the faculty, every student, every staff member, every alumna and alumnus, and dozens of friends of the College.&quot; According to the trustees, the process was intended to reinvent the college, and the board said it received over 600 contributions to this end.

The results of the process were published in June 1994 in a 36-page document titled &quot;Symposium Report of the Bennington College Board of Trustees&quot;. Recommended changes included the following:
*Adoption of a &quot;teacher-practitioner&quot; ideal;
*Abandonment of academic divisions in favor of &quot;polymorphous, dynamically changing Faculty Program Groups&quot;;
*Replacement of the college&#x27;s system of presumptive tenure with &quot;an experimental contract system&quot;; and
*A 10% tuition reduction over the following five years. In 1988, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bennington was the most expensive college in the country.

Near the end of June 1994, 27 faculty members (approximately one-third of the total faculty body) were notified by certified mail that their contracts would not be renewed. (The exact number of fired faculty members is listed as 25 or 26 in some reports, a discrepancy partly because at least one faculty member, photographer Neil Rappaport, was reinstated on appeal shortly after his firing.) As recommended in the Symposium, the trustees abolished the presumptive tenure system, leaving the institution with no form of tenure. The firings attracted considerable media attention.

Some students and alumni protested, and the college was censured for its actions by the American Association of University Professors, who said, &quot;academic freedom is insecure, and academic tenure is nonexistent today at Bennington College.&quot; Critics of the Symposium, and the 1994 firings, have alleged that the Symposium was essentially a sham, designed to provide a pretext for the removal of faculty members to whom the college&#x27;s president, Elizabeth Coleman, was hostile. Some have questioned the timing of the firings, arguing that by waiting until the end of June, the college made it impossible for students affected by the firings to transfer to other institutions.

President Coleman responded that the decision was fundamentally &quot;about ideas&quot;, stating that &quot;Bennington became mediocre over time&quot; and that the college was in need of radical change. Coleman argued that the college was in dire financial straits, saying that &quot;had Bennington done nothing ... the future of this institution was seriously in doubt.&quot; In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Barr, chairman of the board of trustees, asserted that Coleman was &quot;not responsible for the redesign of the college ... It was the board of trustees&quot;.

In May 1996, 17 of the faculty members terminated in the 1994 firings filed a lawsuit against Bennington College, seeking $3.7 million in damages and reinstatement to their former positions. In December 2000, the case was settled out of court; as part of the settlement, the fired faculty members received $1.89 million and an apology from the college. In the immediate wake of the controversy, for the 1994–1995 academic year, the college&#x27;s enrollment dropped to a record low of 370 undergraduates, and the following year (1995–1996), undergraduate enrollment declined to 285. According to Coleman, a student body of 600 undergraduates was required for the college to break even.

===2000s and 2010s===
, the college reports a total enrollment of 755 students with steady increases in quality student applications. Bennington College appeared on the Princeton Review&#x27;s 2018 Best Northeastern Colleges List, which includes the schools that it considers &quot;academically outstanding and well worth consideration in your college search&quot;. Bennington also appeared on Princeton&#x27;s &quot;Green Schools&quot; list. Notably, Bennington was also featured in a 2016 article by &quot;Forbes&quot; as one of &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Hot Colleges&quot; highlighting the institution&#x27;s recent flourishing &quot;under bold, entrepreneurial leadership&quot;.

In 2015 Bennington College announced a $5 million gift from the Helen Frankenthaler Foundation. The largest single gift ever awarded by the foundation has helped establish the Helen Frankenthaler Fund for the Visual Arts and provides support for all aspects of the school&#x27;s visual arts program including curricula, facilities, programs, and faculty. In recognition of the gift, the visual arts wing of the college&#x27;s 120,000-square-foot arts facility was renamed the Helen Frankenthaler Visual Arts Center.

In October 2016 the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.

In the summer of 2020, the board of trustees announced that Laura Walker would be the next college president.

Bennington College has an acceptance rate of 45%. 

===Presidents===
==Academics==
In 2024, the college had a student to faculty ratio of 9:1 with 63% of classes with fewer than 20 students. Bennington College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education. 

===Undergraduate admissions===
In 2024, the college accepted 45.3% of undergraduate applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.51 GPA. The college does not require submission of standardized test scores, Bennington being a test optional school. Those submitting test scores had an average 1260-1370 SAT score (13% submitting scores) or average 29-33 ACT score (5% submitting scores).

===Rankings===
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Bennington tied for #112 in National Liberal Arts Colleges, tied for #19 in Most Innovative Schools, and tied for #96 in Top Performers on Social Mobility out of 211 National Liberal Arts Colleges.

===Plan Process===
At Bennington, students receive graduate-style advising from a faculty member who assists with course selection, internship and job applications, graduate school preparation, and more. Bennington does not have traditional academic majors for undergraduate students. Instead, the Plan Process is an alternative to majors, which encourages students to lead their own education, rather than choosing from pre-existing paths.
Within the Plan Process, there are no required courses, so from the moment students arrive, they are free to begin crafting their plan of study to meet their interests and explore new fields. In their second year, students must submit an essay-style Plan proposal, which details their desired primary and secondary areas of study, a summary of their interests and previous coursework, and a framework for how their studies should progress to culminate in senior work in one of the existing disciplines such as Society, Culture and Thought, Advancement of Public Action, Dance, Environmental Studies, Visual Arts, and others (&quot;see&quot;,) Students then meet with a committee of faculty members and their academic adviser to review the proposed Plan and make any necessary changes. After their Plan is improved, students regularly meet with their adviser to choose relevant courses and meet again with the Plan committee each fall to discuss their progress towards completion. Because of the Plan Process, no two students at Bennington will graduate with the same exact mix of learning.

===Field Work Term===
Field Work Term is a required annual internship program that gives students the opportunity to gain professional experience beyond the classroom before graduating. Field Work Term experiences often inform students&#x27; decisions about career planning and can even lead to job opportunities post graduation. Bennington is the only college that has required an annual internship for students since its founding.

==Campus==
The groundbreaking ceremony for Bennington College took place on August 16, 1931, and construction of the original Bennington College campus was completed by 1936. The Boston architectural firm, J.W. Ames and E.S. Dodge designed Commons, the 12 original student houses, as well as the reconfiguration of the Barn from a working farm building into classrooms and administrative offices. The original student houses were named for the people integral to the founding of the college. The campus was built by more than 100 local craftsmen, many of whom had been out of work since the stock market crash of 1929. The campus stretches 440 acres with main campus centered on 10 acres. There are 300 wooded acres, 15 acres of wetland, and 5 acres of tilled farmland.

In 2021 the director of campus security resigned after hiring a white supremacist to the campus safety staff. Unfortunately, in the past ten years Bennington has had a high student suicide rate. The college goes to great lengths not to involve local media when this occurs, however, there have been at least 6 student suicides in the last 7 years.

===Alumni===
Anne Ramsey, Actress

H. Auden, Stanley Kunitz, Mary Oliver, Theodore Roethke, Donald Hall, and Anne Waldman, and educator Joseph S. Murphy, the future Chancellor of the City University of New York.

==Robert Frost Stone House Museum==
In 2017, Bennington College acquired the Robert Frost Stone House Museum through a gift from the Friends of Robert Frost. Robert Frost lived in the colonial era home in Shaftsbury, VT from 1920 to 1929, during which time he wrote many of his well known works including the poem &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;.

Frost was involved in the founding of Bennington during the 1930s, suggesting the use of narrative evaluations which became a core aspect of the college&#x27;s academic process.

==In literature==
Camden College, a fictionalized version of Bennington, appears in the works of Bret Easton Ellis, Jill Eisenstadt, and Jonathan Lethem. Whereas Ellis&#x27;s Camden College is located in New Hampshire, Lethem&#x27;s Camden is in Vermont, and is notable for being the most expensive college in the United States. All three of the writers attended Bennington College, which is really located in Vermont, and was at one time notorious for being the most expensive college in the United States. Bennington graduate Donna Tartt uses the same Bennington-inspired backdrop for her 1992 novel &quot;The Secret History&quot;, but for her it is &quot;Hampden&quot; College. However, Eisenstadt and Lethem use &#x27;Camden&#x27; in &quot;From Rockaway&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot; (2003), respectively.

Camden is first mentioned in Ellis&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1985), and is the central setting of his next, &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (1987). Eisenstadt&#x27;s &quot;From Rockaway&quot; and Tartt&#x27;s &quot;The Secret History&quot; both depict working class young people who gain scholarships to the fictionalized liberal arts college; both are alluded to in &quot;The Rules of Attraction&quot; (Ellis having read the first draft of &quot;Secret History&quot;). Characters said to have attended Camden appear in Ellis&#x27;s &quot;American Psycho&quot; (1991), &quot;The Informers&quot; (1994) and &quot;Glamorama&quot; (1998), the last of which features flashback sequences to the characters&#x27; Camden days. In Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot; (2003), Camden appears later in the novel once main character Dylan Ebdus begins college. In Ellis&#x27;s pseudo-autobiographical horror novel &quot;Lunar Park&quot; (2005), the fictional Bret Easton Ellis attended Camden College and recalls many of its fictional characters.

<text>TOPS-10 System (Timesharing /TotalOperatingSystem-10) is a discontinued operating system from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for the PDP-10 (or DECsystem-10) mainframe computer family. Launched in 1967, TOPS-10 evolved from the earlier &quot;Monitor&quot; software for the PDP-6 and PDP-10 computers; this was renamed to TOPS-10 in 1970.

== Overview ==
TOPS-10 supported shared memory and allowed the development of one of the first true multiplayer computer games. The game, called DECWAR, was a text-oriented &quot;Star Trek&quot;-type game. Users at terminals typed in commands and fought each other in real time. TOPS-10 was also the home of the original Multi User Dungeon, MUD, the forerunner to today&#x27;s MMORPGs.

Another groundbreaking application was called &quot;FORUM&quot;. This application was perhaps the first so-called &quot;CB Simulator&quot; that allowed users to converse with one another in what is now known as a chat room. This application showed the potential of multi-user communication and led to the development of CompuServe&#x27;s chat application.

TOPS-10 had a very robust application programming interface (API) that used a mechanism called a UUO or &quot;Unimplemented User Operation&quot;. UUOs implemented operating system calls in a way that made them look like machine instructions. The Monitor Call API was very much ahead of its time, like most of the operating system, and made system programming on DECsystem-10s simple and powerful.

The TOPS-10 scheduler supported prioritized run queues, and appended a process onto a queue depending on its priority. The system also included User file and Device independence.

== History ==
=== Release history ===
The PDP-6 Monitor software was first released in 1964. Support for the PDP-10&#x27;s KA10 processor was added to the Monitor in release 2.18 in 1967. The TOPS-10 name was first used in 1970 for release 5.01. Release 6.01 (May 1974) was the first TOPS-10 to implement virtual memory (demand paging), enabling programs larger than physical memory to be run. From release 7.00 onwards, symmetrical multiprocessing was available (as opposed to the master/slave arrangement used before). The final release of TOPS-10 was 7.04 in 1988.

=== TOPS-10 today ===
Hobbyists are now entitled to set up and use TOPS-10 under a Hobbyist&#x27;s License.

The easiest way for the hobbyist to run TOPS-10 is to acquire a suitable emulator and an operating system image. TOPS-10 may also be generated from archived original distribution &quot;tapes&quot;.
Paul Allen maintained several publicly accessible historic computer systems, including a DECsystem-2065 running TOPS-10.

== Software ==
=== Implemented programming languages ===
The TOPS-10 assembler, MACRO-10, was bundled with the TOPS-10 distribution.

The following programming languages were implemented on TOPS-10 as layered products:

* ALGOL, as ALGOL-10 v10B, a compiler used for general computing
* APL, as APL-SF V2, an interpreter used for mathematical modelling
* BASIC, as BASIC-10 v17F, an interpreter used for general computing
* BLISS, as BLISS-10 and BLISS-36, compilers used for systems programming
* COBOL, as COBOL-68 and COBOL-74, compilers used for business computing
* Fortran, as FORTRAN-10 v11, a compiler used for numerical computing

The following programming languages were implemented on TOPS-10 as contributions from DECUS members:

* FOCAL, as FOCAL-10
* Forth, a threaded interpreted language
* IMP72
* Lisp, an interpreter used for AI programming
* Pascal, a compiler used for computing education
* PILOT
* SAM76
* Simula, a compiler used for modeling
* SNOBOL, an interpreter used for string processing
* BCPL, a compiler implemented by Essex University

=== Implemented user utilities ===
The following major user utilities were implemented on TOPS-10:

* RMS (Records Management Services)
* IQL (Interactive Query language)
* DBMS-10 (CODASYL Database Management System)

=== Notable games implemented on TOPS-10 ===
* ADVENT
* DECWAR, as noted above
* FORUM, as noted above
* HAUNT, an early role-playing game
* Mac Hack, a chess program by Richard Greenblatt
* MUD

== Legacy ==
MS-DOS was heavily influenced by TOPS-10. Identical elements include three characters long file extensions, several standard extensions (e.g., EXE, TXT), the asterisk () as a wildcard, the usage of the slash () as a switch separator and more.

<text>Chemical specificity is the ability of binding site of a macromolecule (such as a protein) to bind specific ligands. The fewer ligands a protein can bind, the greater its specificity.

Specificity describes the strength of binding between a given protein and ligand. This relationship can be described by a dissociation constant, which characterizes the balance between bound and unbound states for the protein-ligand system. In the context of a single enzyme and a pair of binding molecules, the two ligands can be compared as stronger or weaker ligands (for the enzyme) on the basis of their dissociation constants. (A lower value corresponds to a stronger binding.)

Specificity for a set of ligands is unrelated to the ability of an enzyme to catalyze a given reaction, with the ligand as a substrate.

If a given enzyme has a high chemical specificity, this means that the set of ligands to which it binds is limited, such that neither binding events nor catalysis can occur at an appreciable rate with additional molecules.

An example of a protein-ligand pair whose binding activity can be highly specific is the antibody-antigen system. Affinity maturation typically leads to highly specific interactions, whereas naive antibodies are promiscuous and bind a larger number of ligands. Conversely, an example of a protein-ligand system that can bind substrates and catalyze multiple reactions effectively is the Cytochrome P450 system, which can be considered a promiscuous enzyme due to its broad specificity for multiple ligands. Proteases are a group of enzymes that show a broad range of cleavage specificities. Promiscuous proteases as digestive enzymes unspecifically degrade peptides, whereas highly specific proteases are involved in signaling cascades.

== Basis ==

=== Binding ===
The interactions between the protein and ligand substantially affect the specificity between the two entities. Electrostatic interactions and Hydrophobic interactions are known to be the most influential in regards to where specificity between two molecules is derived from. The strength of these interactions between the protein and ligand often positively correlate with their specificity for one another.

The specificity of a binding process is strongly dependent of the flexibility of the binding partners. A rigid protein is very restricted in its binding possibilities. A flexible protein can adapt its conformation to a larger number of ligands and thus is more promiscuous. As the binding process usually leads to a rigidification of both binding partners in the complex, binding of a flexible protein usually comes with an entropic penalty. This is the main reason for the frequently found positive correlation of binding affinity and binding specificity. Antibodies show a strong correlation between rigidity and specificity. This correlation extends far beyond the paratope of the antibodies 

=== Catalysis ===
Enzyme specificity refers to the interactions between any particular enzyme and its corresponding substrate. In addition to the specificity in binding its substrates, correct proximity and orientation as well as binding the transition state provide an additional layer of enzyme specificity.

== Types ==
Enzymes vary in the specificity of the substrates that they bind to, in order to carry out specific physiological functions. Some enzymes may need to be less specific and therefore may bind to numerous substrates to catalyze a reaction. On the other hand, certain physiological functions require extreme specificity of the enzyme for a single specific substrate in order for a proper reaction and physiological phenotype to occur. The different types of categorizations differ based on their specificity for substrates. Most generally, they are divided into four groups: absolute, group, linkage, and stereochemical specificity.

=== Absolute specificity ===
Absolute specificity can be thought of as being exclusive, in which an enzyme acts upon one specific substrate. Absolute specific enzymes will only catalyze one reaction with its specific substrate. For example, lactase is an enzyme specific for the degradation of lactose into two sugar monosaccharides, glucose and galactose. Another example is Glucokinase, which is an enzyme involved in the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. It is primarily active in the liver and is the main isozyme of Hexokinase. Its absolute specificity refers to glucose being the only hexose that is able to be its substrate, as opposed to hexokinase, which accommodates many hexoses as its substrate.

=== Group specificity ===
Group specificity occurs when an enzyme will only react with molecules that have specific functional groups, such as aromatic structures, phosphate groups, and methyls. One example is Pepsin, an enzyme that is crucial in digestion of foods ingested in our diet, that hydrolyzes peptide bonds in between hydrophobic amino acids, with recognition for aromatic side chains such as phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine. Another example is hexokinase, an enzyme involved in glycolysis that phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate. This enzyme exhibits group specificity by allowing multiple hexoses (6 carbon sugars) as its substrate. Glucose is one of the most important substrates in metabolic pathways involving hexokinase due to its role in glycolysis, but is not the only substrate that hexokinase can catalyze a reaction with.

=== Bond specificity ===
Bond specificity, unlike group specificity, recognizes particular chemical bond types. This differs from group specificity, as it is not reliant on the presence of particular functional groups in order to catalyze a particular reaction, but rather a certain bond type (for example, a peptide bond).

=== Stereochemical specificity ===

This type of specificity is sensitive to the substrate&#x27;s optical activity of orientation. Stereochemical molecules differ in the way in which they rotate plane polarized light, or orientations of linkages (see alpha, beta glycosidic linkages). Enzymes that are stereochemically specific will bind substrates with these particular properties. For example, beta-glycosidase will only react with beta-glycosidic bonds which are present in cellulose, but not present in starch and glycogen, which contain alpha-glycosidic linkages. This is relevant in how mammals are able to digest food. For instance, the enzyme Amylase is present in mammal saliva, that is stereo-specific for alpha-linkages, this is why mammals are able to efficiently use starch and glycogen as forms of energy, but not cellulose (because it is a beta-linkage).

== Determination ==
Specific equilibrium dissociation constant for formation of the enzyme-substrate complex is known as formula_1. It is used as a measure of affinity, with higher values indicating a lower affinity.

For the given equation (E = enzyme, S = substrate, P = product),

: formula_2

formula_1 would be equivalent to formula_4, where formula_5 and formula_6 are the rates of the forward and backward reaction, respectively in the conversion of individual E and S to the enzyme substrate complex.

Information theory allows for a more quantitative definition of specificity by calculating the entropy in the binding spectrum.

=== Application to enzyme kinetics ===
The chemical specificity of an enzyme for a particular substrate can be found using two variables that are derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation. formula_7 approximates the dissociation constant of enzyme-substrate complexes. formula_8 represents the turnover rate, or the number of reactions catalyzed by an enzyme over the enzyme amount. formula_8 over formula_7 is known as the specificity constant, which gives a measure of the affinity of a substrate to some particular enzyme. Also known as the efficiency of an enzyme, this relationship reveals an enzyme&#x27;s preference for a particular substrate. The higher the specificity constant of an enzyme corresponds to a high preference for that substrate.

== Significance ==

=== Medical research relevance ===
Enzymatic specificity provides useful insight into enzyme structure, which ultimately determines and plays a role in physiological functions. Specificity studies also may provide information of the catalytic mechanism.

Specificity is important for novel drug discovery and the field of clinical research, with new drugs being tested for its specificity to the target molecule in various rounds of clinical trials. Drugs must contain as specific as possible structures in order to minimize the possibility of off-target affects that would produce unfavorable symptoms in the patient. Drugs depend on the specificity of the designed molecules and formulations to inhibit particular molecular targets. Novel drug discovery progresses with experiments involving highly specific compounds. For example, the basis that drugs must successfully be proven to accomplish is both the ability to bind the target receptor in the physiological environment with high specificity and also its ability to transduce a signal to produce a favorable biological effect against the sickness or disease that the drug is intended to negate.

== Applications ==
Scientific techniques, such as immunostaining, depend on chemical specificity. Immunostaining utilizes the chemical specificity of antibodies in order to detect a protein of interest at the cellular level. Another technique that relies on chemical specificity is Western blotting, which is utilized to detect a certain protein of interest in a tissue. This technique involves gel electrophoresis followed by transferring of the sample onto a membrane which is stained by antibodies. Antibodies are specific to the target protein of interest, and will contain a fluorescent tag signaling the presence of the researcher&#x27;s protein of interest.

<text>In biochemistry and molecular biology, a binding site is a region on a macromolecule such as a protein that binds to another molecule with specificity. The binding partner of the macromolecule is often referred to as a ligand. Ligands may include other proteins (resulting in a protein–protein interaction), enzyme substrates, second messengers, hormones, or allosteric modulators. The binding event is often, but not always, accompanied by a conformational change that alters the protein&#x27;s function. Binding to protein binding sites is most often reversible (transient and non-covalent), but can also be covalent reversible or irreversible.

== Function ==
Binding of a ligand to a binding site on protein often triggers a change in conformation in the protein and results in altered cellular function. Hence binding site on protein are critical parts of signal transduction pathways. Types of ligands include neurotransmitters, toxins, neuropeptides, and steroid hormones. Binding sites incur functional changes in a number of contexts, including enzyme catalysis, molecular pathway signaling, homeostatic regulation, and physiological function. Electric charge, steric shape and geometry of the site selectively allow for highly specific ligands to bind, activating a particular cascade of cellular interactions the protein is responsible for.

=== Catalysis ===

Enzymes incur catalysis by binding more strongly to transition states than substrates and products. At the catalytic binding site, several different interactions may act upon the substrate. These range from electric catalysis, acid and base catalysis, covalent catalysis, and metal ion catalysis. These interactions decrease the activation energy of a chemical reaction by providing favorable interactions to stabilize the high energy molecule. Enzyme binding allows for closer proximity and exclusion of substances irrelevant to the reaction. Side reactions are also discouraged by this specific binding.

Types of enzymes that can perform these actions include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases.

For instance, the transferase hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to make glucose-6-phosphate. Active site residues of hexokinase allow for stabilization of the glucose molecule in the active site and spur the onset of an alternative pathway of favorable interactions, decreasing the activation energy.

=== Inhibition ===
Protein inhibition by inhibitor binding may induce obstruction in pathway regulation, homeostatic regulation and physiological function.

Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate to bind to free enzymes at active sites and thus impede the production of the enzyme-substrate complex upon binding. For example, carbon monoxide poisoning is caused by the competitive binding of carbon monoxide as opposed to oxygen in hemoglobin.

Uncompetitive inhibitors, alternatively, bind concurrently with substrate at active sites. Upon binding to an enzyme substrate (ES) complex, an enzyme substrate inhibitor (ESI) complex is formed. Similar to competitive inhibitors, the rate at product formation is decreased also.

Lastly, mixed inhibitors are able to bind to both the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. However, in contrast to competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, mixed inhibitors bind to the allosteric site. Allosteric binding induces conformational changes that may increase the protein&#x27;s affinity for substrate. This phenomenon is called positive modulation. Conversely, allosteric binding that decreases the protein&#x27;s affinity for substrate is negative modulation.

== Types ==

=== Active site ===

At the active site, a substrate binds to an enzyme to induce a chemical reaction. Substrates, transition states, and products can bind to the active site, as well as any competitive inhibitors. For example, in the context of protein function, the binding of calcium to troponin in muscle cells can induce a conformational change in troponin. This allows for tropomyosin to expose the actin-myosin binding site to which the myosin head binds to form a cross-bridge and induce a muscle contraction.

In the context of the blood, an example of competitive binding is carbon monoxide which competes with oxygen for the active site on heme. Carbon monoxide&#x27;s high affinity may outcompete oxygen in the presence of low oxygen concentration. In these circumstances, the binding of carbon monoxide induces a conformation change that discourages heme from binding to oxygen, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning.
=== Allosteric site ===
At the regulatory site, the binding of a ligand may elicit amplified or inhibited protein function. The binding of a ligand to an allosteric site of a multimeric enzyme often induces positive cooperativity, that is the binding of one substrate induces a favorable conformation change and increases the enzyme&#x27;s likelihood to bind to a second substrate. Regulatory site ligands can involve homotropic and heterotropic ligands, in which single or multiple types of molecule affects enzyme activity respectively.

Enzymes that are highly regulated are often essential in metabolic pathways. For example, phosphofructokinase (PFK), which phosphorylates fructose in glycolysis, is largely regulated by ATP. Its regulation in glycolysis is imperative because it is the committing and rate limiting step of the pathway. PFK also controls the amount of glucose designated to form ATP through the catabolic pathway. Therefore, at sufficient levels of ATP, PFK is allosterically inhibited by ATP. This regulation efficiently conserves glucose reserves, which may be needed for other pathways. Citrate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, also works as an allosteric regulator of PFK.

=== Single- and multi-chain binding sites ===
Binding sites can be characterized also by their structural features. Single-chain sites (of “monodesmic” ligands, μόνος: single, δεσμός: binding) are formed by a single protein chain, while multi-chain sites (of &quot;polydesmic” ligands, πολοί: many) are frequent in protein complexes, and are formed by ligands that bind more than one protein chain, typically in or near protein interfaces. Recent research shows that binding site structure has profound consequences for the biology of protein complexes (evolution of function, allostery).

=== Cryptic binding sites ===
Cryptic binding sites are the binding sites that are transiently formed in an apo form or that are induced by ligand binding. Considering the cryptic binding sites increases the size of the potentially “druggable” human proteome from ~40% to ~78% of disease-associated proteins. The binding sites have been investigated by: support vector machine applied to &quot;CryptoSite&quot; data set, Extension of &quot;CryptoSite&quot; data set, long timescale molecular dynamics simulation with Markov state model and with biophysical experiments, and cryptic-site index that is based on relative accessible surface area.

== Binding curves ==

Binding curves describe the binding behavior of ligand to a protein. Curves can be characterized by their shape, sigmoidal or hyperbolic, which reflect whether or not the protein exhibits cooperative or noncooperative binding behavior respectively. Typically, the x-axis describes the concentration of ligand and the y-axis describes the fractional saturation of ligands bound to all available binding sites. The Michaelis Menten equation is usually used when determining the shape of the curve. The Michaelis Menten equation is derived based on steady-state conditions and accounts for the enzyme reactions taking place in a solution. However, when the reaction takes place while the enzyme is bound to a substrate, the kinetics play out differently.

Modeling with binding curves are useful when evaluating the binding affinities of oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin, which has four heme groups, exhibits cooperative binding. This means that the binding of oxygen to a heme group on hemoglobin induces a favorable conformation change that allows for increased binding favorability of oxygen for the next heme groups. In these circumstances, the binding curve of hemoglobin will be sigmoidal due to its increased binding favorability for oxygen. Since myoglobin has only one heme group, it exhibits noncooperative binding which is hyperbolic on a binding curve.

== Applications ==
Biochemical differences between different organisms and humans are useful for drug development. For instance, penicillin kills bacteria by inhibiting the bacterial enzyme -transpeptidase, destroying the development of the bacterial cell wall and inducing cell death. Thus, the study of binding sites is relevant to many fields of research, including cancer mechanisms, drug formulation, and physiological regulation. The formulation of an inhibitor to mute a protein&#x27;s function is a common form of pharmaceutical therapy.

In the scope of cancer, ligands that are edited to have a similar appearance to the natural ligand are used to inhibit tumor growth. For example, Methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic, acts as a competitive inhibitor at the dihydrofolate reductase active site. This interaction inhibits the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, shutting off production of DNA, RNA and proteins. Inhibition of this function represses neoplastic growth and improves severe psoriasis and adult rheumatoid arthritis.

In cardiovascular illnesses, drugs such as beta blockers are used to treat patients with hypertension. Beta blockers (β-Blockers) are antihypertensive agents that block the binding of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline to β1 and β2 receptors in the heart and blood vessels. These receptors normally mediate the sympathetic &quot;fight or flight&quot; response, causing constriction of the blood vessels.

Competitive inhibitors are also largely found commercially. Botulinum toxin, known commercially as Botox, is a neurotoxin that causes flaccid paralysis in the muscle due to binding to acetylcholine dependent nerves. This interaction inhibits muscle contractions, giving the appearance of smooth muscle.

A number of computational tools have been developed for the prediction of the location of binding sites on proteins. These can be broadly classified into sequence based or structure based. Sequence based methods rely on the assumption that the sequences of functionally conserved portions of proteins such as binding site are conserved. Structure based methods require the 3D structure of the protein. These methods in turn can be subdivided into template and pocket based methods. Template based methods search for 3D similarities between the target protein and proteins with known binding sites. The pocket based methods search for concave surfaces or buried pockets in the target protein that possess features such as hydrophobicity and hydrogen bonding capacity that would allow them to bind ligands with high affinity. Even though the term pocket is used here, similar methods can be used to predict binding sites used in protein-protein interactions that are usually more planar, not in pockets.

<text>Sabriel is a fantasy novel by Garth Nix, first published in 1995. It is the first in his Old Kingdom series, followed by &quot;Lirael&quot;, &quot;Abhorsen&quot;, &quot;Clariel&quot;, &quot;Goldenhand,&quot; and &quot;Terciel and Elinor&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
The novel is set in two neighbouring fictional countries: To the South lies Ancelstierre, which has a technology level and society similar to that of early-20th century Australia To the North lies the Old Kingdom, where there exists two oppositional forms of magic, Free Magic, which is malevolent, and Charter Magic, which is benevolent. The existence of this is officially denied by the government of Ancelstierre, and disbelieved by most of Ancelstierre&#x27;s inhabitants. Yet, an ancient wall separates the two countries, on the south side of which the Ancelstierran government maintains, despite its official denial of magic, a military post whose purpose is to monitor and combat hostile Free Magic beings and effects of Free Magic that cross the wall. Near the border some magic crosses the Wall, especially on days when the wind is blowing out of the Old Kingdom. Since the fall two hundred years previously of the Old Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Family, which was charged with preserving the Charter, the integrity of Charter Magic has declined, allowing the hostile entities to roam, ranging from the animated dead to powerful Free Magic necromancers and Free Magic elementals.

These living Dead are raised by the Free Magic Necromancers, diviners of the dead who roam the Old Kingdom or live in Death, using Hands to do their bidding. To remedy the problem of dangerous living dead, a Charter Magic necromancer under the title of Abhorsen invokes Charter Magic using a bandolier of Bells and a sword to put the dead to final rest. At the time of Sabriel, the Abhorsen is her father, Terciel, who has the job of putting the dead to rest in the Old Kingdom, which is especially difficult since a new evil is rising as the protection of Charter Magic weakens.

When the current Abhorsen is overcome by a Free Magic being and sent beyond the Seventh Gate of Death, he sends his bells (the primary tools of a necromancer, used in various ways to control the Dead) and sword to Sabriel via an undead messenger bound and under his control. Sabriel is at an Ancelstierre school for girls to remain out of reach of those who might try to strike at her father through her and end the Abhorsen bloodline. The bound undead is also attempting to speak, but she must enter death in order to make out the words. She is instructed by her father (speaking through the undead messenger in Death) to return to the Old Kingdom to take on the role of Abhorsen and stop the return of Kerrigor, an especially malign Free Magic being, to Life. While in Death obtaining her father&#x27;s guidance, she narrowly avoids a fatal altercation with a Lesser Dead.

==Plot summary==
The book opens with Sabriel raising a freshly killed rabbit from death. She is a young girl attending Wyverly College, an all-female boarding school in Ancelstierre. An undead creature enters the dormitory where Sabriel lives and frightens all of the girls. Sabriel, however, notices it is holding a satchel and is attempting to speak. She enters Death to see what it is and notices strings attached to it passing over the waterfall of the First Gate; a sign that the creature is under the control of a necromancer further in Death. It is very weak, but Sabriel makes out that it is a messenger bound by her father who is past the Seventh Gate of Death. She is instructed by her father (through the messenger) that she is to take on the role of Abhorsen and defeat Kerrigor (a powerful Free Magic necromancer) who is attempting to make his way back into Life to break the Charter which binds the Free Magic and thus destroy the Charter of the Old Kingdom. She retrieves the satchel which contains the Abhorsen&#x27;s bandelier of bells, the Abhorsen&#x27;s sword and a map of the Old Kingdom.

Having left her school, Sabriel crosses the Wall using papers given to her by her father. Her destination is Abhorsen&#x27;s House, the home of her father. Near the wall, she meets a southern colonel and his troops. The soldiers are using brute force to stop hordes of Shadow Hands from dismantling the Wall and crossing over. The areas near the Wall are being evacuated and only those who are inhabitants of the Old Kingdom are allowed the cross.

As she continues her journey, Sabriel becomes aware that she is being stalked by a Mordicant, a powerful Dead creature. She is able to outrun the creature and reach the safety of Abhorsen&#x27;s House, which is located on an island in the center of the river. (The Dead cannot cross fast and deep running water.)

Inside Abhorsen&#x27;s house, Sabriel is able to rest and obtain food and other supplies, as well as armor. She also meets Mogget, a Free Magic construct who takes the form of a small white cat, wearing a collar with a powerful binding spell on it and a miniature Saraneth hanging from it. Mogget insists on accompanying her on her journey to find her father. Later, they look out over the walls surrounding the house and discover the Dead attempting to build a bridge. Sabriel performs a ritual to summon a flood of water and then flees the house by Paperwing (a magically propelled plane-like structure.) While in the air, Sabriel and Mogget are attacked by the Dead, and Sabriel loosens Mogget&#x27;s collar to avoid a fatal crash. They fall into a sinkhole, where Mogget, in his unbound form, attempts to murder Sabriel. However, she is able to bind him anew with a ring given to her for that purpose.

The next day, Sabriel and Mogget walk through a tunnel to another sinkhole, which Mogget determines to be Holehallow, the historical burial place of the royal family. Each king is buried in a boat. Sabriel discovers that the figurehead on one of the boats is not a wooden carving but an actual man, who has been imprisoned in that form for two hundred years. The man tells Sabriel that he was a Royal Guard before his imprisonment, and asks to be called Touchstone (a jester&#x27;s name) for reasons that remain cryptic.

Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget continue their journey, stopping to help rid a seaside village of a Dead creature. They obtain a boat there and sail up the coast of the Old Kingdom until they reach Belisaere, the capital. They find the Abhorsen in an underground reservoir in Belisaere, trapped in Death. Since he has stayed too long in Death, he cannot return for long, but with what little time he has left, the Abhorsen tells Sabriel about the evil known as Kerrigor. Kerrigor has risen far from Death and intends to wreak havoc in the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Sabriel releases her father from Death, and once they emerge from Death, father and daughter part for the last time—he, to ring the bell Astarael (the sound of which throws everyone who hears it far into the realm of Death) and delay Kerrigor&#x27;s havoc; and she, to save Touchstone by bringing him (and herself) as far away from Astarael&#x27;s music as possible. To prevent him from losing to Death, she kisses him roughly in order to keep him focused on Life. In the process of ringing Astarael, Sabriel&#x27;s father releases Mogget.

They succeed, but as long as Kerrigor&#x27;s body is intact, he will rise from Death again and again. Sabriel and Touchstone use another Paperwing to bring them as close to the Wall as possible, and cross over to Ancelstierre to find Kerrigor&#x27;s body, following the clairvoyant guidance of the Clayr twins Sanar and Ryelle. They find the body, and Sabriel finally defeats Kerrigor by binding him with Ranna and Mogget&#x27;s collar.

She dies but the previous Abhorsens prevent her from crossing into Final Death as she cannot die without someone else to take her place as Abhorsen. She wakes up with Touchstone before her, and both Mogget and Kerrigor asleep, bound by Ranna (the first of seven necromantic bells that instills sleep and quiescence in those who hear it).

==Important characters and magical entities==

===The Bloodlines===

Thousands of years ago, seven of the Nine Bright Shiners sacrificed their powers to create the Charter: a combination of powerful objects (the Great Stones and the Wall) and three magic blood lines, known as the Abhorsen, the Clayr and the Royal Family. Five of the Seven completely lost themselves (one in each object or blood line) while two remained somewhat independent. One invested his/her power in the Royal bloodline, one in the Abhorsen&#x27;s and one in the Clayr&#x27;s (which is why the Clayr greet Sabriel as &quot;cousin&quot;). The remaining two, known as the &quot;Wallmakers&quot; invested themselves in several objects of power, including the Stones and Wall, then disappeared. These artifacts, the Charter Stones, are sources of the web of Charter magic that maintains peace and order over the kingdom. The Bloodlines all have a higher concentration of strong Charter mages than the general populace.

====The Abhorsens====
One of the most respected figures in the Old Kingdom, the Abhorsen uses both the dangerous Free Magic-based powers of a necromancer and the benevolent magic of the Charter to keep the gates of Death against the return of Dead spirits back into Life. Sabriel and her father are members of the Abhorsen family. They use the bells, named after the seven bright shiners that established the old kingdom, in tandem with their natural affinity with Death, granted by their ancestor bright shiner, to amplify their powers. The bells, smallest to largest, are Ranna, Mosrael, Kibeth, Dyrim, Belgaer, Saraneth, and Astarael. Saraneth, the &quot;binder&quot;, is thought to be the original Abhorsen, and the bright shiner who invested her powers in this bloodline. Her gift is &quot;binding&quot;, just as the Abhorsens job is to &quot;bind&quot; the dead to Death. Ranna the &quot;sleepbringer&quot;, causing listeners to fall asleep; she is the least tricksome. Mosrael, &quot;the waker&quot;, wakes the dead, bringing them into life as it throws the necromancer farther into death. Kibeth, &quot;walker&quot;, forces the dead to march back into death, or wherever the ringer desires, although if the ringer is not careful it may end up &quot;walking&quot; her. Dyrim is the &quot;speaker&quot;, granting the ability of speech to the dead, or taking it away. Belgaer is the &quot;thinker&quot; and can restore independent thought to the dead and resurrect old memories, but can also erase them in a careless hand. Astarael is the &quot;Sorrowful&quot;. Last and final of the bells, she sends all who hear her, including the ringer, deep into death. It is nearly impossible to return after hearing Astarael. Like all three bloodlines, the Abhorsen bloodline not only defines their job (the Abhorsen may only be chosen from direct blood relatives) and grants them their powers, but also determines their appearance. All members of the Abhorsen family have black hair and their skin is unnaturally pale. Among the families guarding the Old Kingdom from disaster, and the only family guarding it from disasters from Death, Abhorsens are unique in their ability to sense Death. They are able to identify undead creatures and differentiate them from the living, and cross over into Death to fight undead minions there and banish them to a final death. They are also the only ones who have the proper authority to enter Death, and therefore the only Necromancers who retain uncorrupted charter marks and mage powers. Their symbol is a silver key on a background of blue.

====The Royal Family====
For centuries, the royalty justly ruled the Old Kingdom from their palace at the capital Belisaere as powerful upholders of the peace, until their fall by the hands of Kerrigor, or Prince Rogirek nicknamed Rogir, a rogue member of the royal family who killed his sisters and mother to use their blood to break the Great Charter Stones. The Kingdom now suffers from their 200-year absence. Unlike the Abhorsens, the Royalty cannot cross into Death at will and do not usually use Free Magic. Their specialty lies in diplomacy and Charter magic. They are connected to the Clayr and Abhorsens in that they&#x27;re a Great Charter. It is thought they are descended from Dyrim, the &quot;speaker&quot;, because of their skill in diplomacy. Their symbol is a golden tower on a sea of red.

====The Clayr====
The largest family among the magical bloodlines, the Clayr are arbiters of justice and foresight who see all from their glacier in the northernmost parts of the Old Kingdom. The Clayr are a family of seers who may, when there is need, pool their powers together to see clear visions of the future, while individually they see only splinters. The Clayr also possess abilities in Charter Magic, but to a lesser extent than the Abhorsen or Royal family lines. They are descended from Mosrael, the &quot;waker&quot;. The Clayr celebrate the young&#x27;s &quot;awakening&quot; of their sight when they receive their first vision. Like the Abhorsen, the Clayr have a strong family resemblance. All daughters of the Clayr (they have few sons), excluding Remembrancers, have brown skin and blonde, almost white, hair. The Glacier of the Clayr is home to a great library, as well, which is a repository of magic and history, and is even used as &quot;cold storage&quot; for particularly dangerous, but immortal, creatures. Their symbol is a seven pointed star.

====The Wallmakers====
The Wallmakers were the builders of the Wall that divides the Old Kingdom from Ancelstriere and creators of the Charter Stones; A Charter Magic bloodline particularly skilled in the creation of magical objects. They created the weaponry of the Royal Family (such as the twin swords wielded by Touchstone), the ceramic, nearly impervious armor known as Gethre owned by the Abhorsens, the Abhorsen&#x27;s sword, and other powerful Charter Magic objects and weapons possessed by the Clayr. It can be deduced that they were the last 2 bright shiners, Ranna and Belgaer. They invested all of their power in their creations, thus leaving no bloodline. Therefore, for the majority of the books, it is apparent that the Wallmakers are &#x27;extinct&#x27; and no longer exist. By the end of Lirael and for the whole of Abhorsen, we find out that the Wallmaker bloodline has been reconstituted in Prince Sameth, explaining his uncanny ability to create magical &quot;toys&quot; and enchant weaponry, which otherwise would &#x27;take months&#x27; to do. The line was probably brought back for the sole purpose of defeating Orannis. The symbol of the Wallmaker is a silver trowel or spade.

====The Dead And Free Magic Creatures====

&quot;The Greater Dead&quot;:
The souls of dead necromancers who have used their dark knowledge to rise from Death. These creatures are the strongest of the Dead and with their necromantic powers they can raise and command the lesser dead. The most powerful of the Greater Dead is Kerrigor, who is the only undead creature to retain his full potential for Free magic after death. Sabriel implies that the true home of the greater dead is beyond the Seventh Gate of Death.

&quot;The Lesser Dead&quot;: 
The collective name for all dead spirits which lack the knowledge and power it takes to become one of the greater dead. Most lesser dead are the souls after ordinary mortals who refused to accept death. They often died under unfortunate circumstances, like Thralk who died in a hunting accident. It is also implied that powerful undead can enslave unwilling souls and force them to become lesser dead. Sabriel fears this fate when she is running from the Mordicant.

&quot;Mordicant&quot;:
A powerful Lesser Dead Free Magic creature which can easily pass through the Gates of Death and into Life where it has a strong hold. It is created by a necromancer by molding bog-clay and human blood, infusing it with Free Magic, and placing a Dead spirit inside. It is described as man-like, with eyes like fire, and grey-green flesh that drips with flames and smoke.
Sabriel defeated a weak Mordicant when she was fourteen years old. However, a very strong one stalked Sabriel on her journey from Ancelstierre to the Abhorsen&#x27;s House. As Sabriel drew closer to the Door in the Long Cliffs leading to the Abhorsen&#x27;s House, it gave chase, but Sabriel made it to the door and through a passageway due to its Charter Magic Guard which momentarily held off the Mordicant. The Abhorsen&#x27;s bridge leading to the house stopped the Mordicant as the undead cannot cross fast and deep running water. The Mordicant then led a siege using Shadow hands and living human slaves who worked non-stop for days to fill the river with earth to allow him to cross. To end the siege, Sabriel called on the Clayr&#x27;s gift of water bringing forth a massive wave to wipe the Mordicant and his slaves away.

&quot;Thralk&quot;:
A dead spirit that slipped out of Death after the commotion Kerrigor caused in breaking through all the gates single-handedly. It stayed in Life for decades, feeding off humans. It found Sabriel in Life on Cloven Crest while she was in Death, though surrounded by a diamond of protection. Sabriel sensed when the creature broke through her protection, and banished it to death with the Abhorsen&#x27;s sword and the bell Kibeth. Thralk died 300 years before when a hunting spear rebounded off a rock and cut his throat.

&quot;Shadow Hands&quot;:
Dead creatures controlled and created by a necromancer. Usually a skilled necromancer uses the heads of dead humans to bring back only their spirits, forming an incorporeal, and dark shadow that only has a pair of hands and does the bidding of the necromancer. Shadow Hands are difficult to destroy by mere force, but can be easily put to rest by the bells of the Abhorsen.
Sabriel suspected a necromancer of having formed Shadow Hands from the soldiers close to Cloven Crest. They attacked Wyverly College after the Dead Hands made it past the soldiers and while Sabriel was attempting to destroy Rogirrek (Rogir)/Kerrigor&#x27;s body.

&quot;Mordaut&quot;:
One of the weaker Dead creatures; a parasite. It cohabits a human body, controlling and hiding in it, and slowly saps the life from it in order to avoid Death. Once it has nearly consumed the soul of the host, it comes out at night and takes the life of any other human around it. It has no definite form and moves like a pool of darkness from host to host. 
Sabriel encountered a Mordaut on the tiny rocky islet of Nestowe, inhabiting the body of a fisherman named Patar. Once she had sensed it and was putting it to sleep with Ranna, the Mordaut killed Patar by sucking all the life out of him instantly. Sabriel stabbed it with her sword and sent it deep into Death using the bells Saraneth (the Binder), Ranna (the Sleepbringer), and Kibeth (the Walker).

&quot;Gore Crows&quot;:
Ordinary crows trapped, killed with a ritual, and infused with a single human spirit by a necromancer. They disintegrate in the sun, are torn apart by wind, and decay over time, but they can fly over running water. They are strongest when freshly killed, infused with a strong spirit, and are great in numbers. They seemingly fly without the use of wings or plumage as they are suspended by the Free Magic which was used to create them. 
A flock of gore crows attacks Sabriel when she is flying in the Paperwing after escaping from Abhorsen&#x27;s house.

==Characters in &quot;Sabriel&quot;==
* Sabriel — Title character. 53rd Abhorsen. She is 18 and finishing her last year at Wyverly College at the start of the novel.
* Mogget — An ancient Free Magic construct of unknown origin; appears in the form of a white cat and is bound by a red Charter magic collar to serve the Abhorsen.
* Touchstone — A bastard prince, son of a former Queen and a nobleman, and is the only remaining heir of the Royal Blood. He was trapped as the wooden figurehead of a ceremonial boat for two hundred years by the Abhorsen of that time in order to save him (and his Blood) from death. He is also Sabriel&#x27;s growing love interest as the story progresses.
* Kerrigor — Formerly known as Rogir, or Rogirek. A Greater Dead adept in Free Magic necromancy, former member of the Royal Family, and who is at odds with the Charter. Powerful Spells of past Abhorsens bound him to Death and his body was buried in Ancelstierre beyond the Wall where magic was not present; but during Sabriel&#x27;s father&#x27;s time, he has awoken and once again trying to destroy the Charter which binds Free Magic. The name Kerrigor, as is revealed by Touchstone, was a childhood nickname, made up by the royal prince himself. It is derived from his full ceremonial name, Rogirek.
* Terciel (known as &quot;Abhorsen&quot;) — Sabriel&#x27;s father, Abhorsen before Sabriel. Revived his daughter after she died at birth. He was unable to save his wife, who died during child birth. Although he rarely visited her physically while she was at school, he would often visit her through sendings of himself in the fireplace at the dark of the moon each month.

==Awards==
&quot;Sabriel&quot; won the Aurealis Award for best young-adult novel and best fantasy novel in 1995. It is also an ALA Notable Book and was a short-list nominee for the 1996 Ditmar Award for best long fiction.

==Film==
According to Publishing News, Garth Nix was preparing to pitch a &quot;Sabriel&quot; film to studios in mid-2008 via Steve Fisher at Agency for the Performing Arts. Nix co-wrote the screenplay with Dan Futterman, actor and Oscar-nominated screenwriter of &quot;Capote&quot; (2005), and Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner at Plan B Entertainment were to produce. The director would be Anand Tucker. Planning for the pitch was delayed by the writer&#x27;s strike, and resumed in February. While the current status of any film is unknown, Nix is now represented by Matthew Snyder at Creative Artists Agency.

<doc id="529625" wikidata="Q6772485" url="?curid=529625" title="Marquardt Corporation">
<text>Marquardt Corporation was an aeronautical engineering firm started in 1944 as Marquardt Aircraft Company and initially dedicated almost entirely to the development of the ramjet engine. Marquardt designs were developed from the mid-1940s into the early 1960s, but as the ramjet disappeared from military usage, the company turned to other fields.

In 1968 Marquardt was merged with CCI Inc. of Tulsa, OK. The newly merged firm became known as &quot;CCI-Marquardt, Inc.&quot;. That name changed back to &quot;CCI Inc.&quot; after a few years. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s pieces of Marquardt were sold off or merged with other firms. By the 1990s, one of the remnants of the company, called &quot;Marquardt Manufacturing Inc.&quot; (MMI) was embroiled in a legal suit with its predecessor organization, which had become principally a landlord who owned the buildings and land where MMI was located. By then, most of the remaining pieces of Marquardt were part of Ferranti in England which was in bankruptcy. MMI subsequently declared bankruptcy and sank into oblivion. The remaining piece, &quot;Marquardt Jet Laboratories&quot; was sold to Kaiser Aerospace. Kaiser-Marquardt was later sold to Primex in Florida. Primex finally became part of Aerojet Rocketdyne.

== History ==

Roy Edward Marquardt was a 1940 aeronautical engineering graduate of California Institute of Technology who was employed at Northrop during World War II on the YB-35 flying-wing bomber project. While working on problems cooling the engines of the YB-35, which were buried in the trailing edge of the wings, he found that the engine heat could be used to provide useful thrust. This created an interest in the ramjet principle, and in November 1944 he started Marquardt Aircraft in Venice, California to develop and sell ramjet engines. In the late 1940s, the company relocated to Van Nuys, California, adjacent to the Van Nuys Airport.

Marquardt&#x27;s initial products were wind tunnels, but by the end of their first year they had delivered an experimental 20 inch (0.51 m) ramjet to the United States Navy for testing. The United States Army Air Forces purchased two of the same design early in 1946, and fitted them to the wingtips of a P-51 Mustang fighter for in-flight testing. By this time the Navy had installed theirs on an F7F Tigercat; flight tests commenced in late 1946. Later, the Navy tested the same engines on an XP-83 and F-82 Twin Mustang.

Another early product developed by Marquardt Aircraft was a pulse-jet powered helicopter which was assembled and flown, but never put into production.

Marquardt also provided space and capital for the James B. Lansing Company, a manufacturer of high-quality audio speakers known by the brand &quot;JBL&quot;. In the late 1940s, Marquardt took over JBL operations, but the firm was divested when Marquardt was acquired by General Tire and Rubber Company in 1949. JBL speakers are still in production.

=== Growth and acquisitions ===

In 1947 Martin built the Gorgon IV missile testbed, powered by the 20&quot; engine. Four Gorgon flights with the new engines were made that year at Mach 0.85 at 10,000 feet (3,000 m) altitude, and in 1948 a newer engine pushed the speeds to Mach 0.9. Martin eventually won a contract to convert the Gorgon design into a target drone, becoming the KDM-1 Plover, and delivering Marquardt a contract for 600 more 20&quot; engines.

In 1948 the newly created United States Air Force took delivery of several larger 30&quot; (0.76 m) designs and fitted them to the wingtips of a P-80 Shooting Star, which became the first manned aircraft to be powered by ramjets alone. An even larger 48&quot; (1.22 m) design was built as a booster for a new interceptor design, but not put into production.

The same year the company also started conversion of the existing engine designs to operate at supersonic speeds. This requires the airflow to be slowed to subsonic speeds for combustion, which is accomplished with a series of shock waves created by a carefully designed inlet. Starting with the existing 20&quot; design from 1947, work progressed until the new engine was ready for use in 1949.

At this point the company had outgrown its Venice plant, and lacked the resources to fund a larger facility. Roy Marquardt sold a controlling interest in the company to General Tire and Rubber Company in 1949, and used the funds to move to a new site in Van Nuys, the former Timm Aircraft factory. The purchase wasn&#x27;t a happy one for General Tire due to management differences, and after making &quot;only&quot; 25% return in one year, they agreed to sell their share of the company to another investor. Eventually, such an investor was found, and General Tire sold their stake to Laurance Rockefeller in 1950 for $250,000.

In the early 1950s supersonic cruise missile and target drone projects for various roles were quite common. Many of them were designed to be shot down as target drones, or simply crash or explode at the end of their mission, so simplicity and low cost was as important as high-speed performance. This made the ramjet ideally suited to those roles. By 1952 Marquardt was involved in a number of projects, including the Navy&#x27;s Rigel missile, and the Air Force&#x27;s CIM-10 Bomarc anti-aircraft missile. To test the new engine design for the Bomarc, the Lockheed X-7 high-speed radio control test aircraft was built.

Over the next few years, the X-7 missile broke many records, and led the Air Force to award Marquardt a contract for the BOMARC missile engines. Originally they had intended to award the production to a larger company with better manufacturing abilities, as the Van Nuys plant wouldn&#x27;t be able to build the 1,500 engines quickly enough. Instead, the Air Force and Marquardt collaborated on a new plant on the shores of Great Salt Lake just outside Ogden, Utah. The plant opened in June 1957 and delivered the first engines a month ahead of schedule. By 1958 the engine was in full production, leading to an additional engine contract from the Air Force for an equally large run of a more advanced version for the IM-99B &quot;Super BOMARC&quot;. Meanwhile, the X-7 continued to break records, eventually setting the speed record for air-breathing vehicles at Mach 4.31.

In 1958 Marquardt purchased the assets of Associated Missile Products Company in Pomona, California (AMPCO), part of AMF Atomic, and named it the Pomona Electronics Division. The Pomona Division designed and manufactured radar simulators used to train navigators, bombardiers, and radar systems operators. In the years following the Marquardt purchase, the Pomona Division created radar simulators for the 412L Weapon Control System in Europe; the GAM-72 (Quail) decoy missile; the GAM-77 (Hound Dog) nuclear missile; the AN/APQ T-10 Simulator for the B-52 Navigator and Bombardier; an Atlas Missile launch simulator; the AN/GPS T-4 air defense radar simulator; and other weapon systems trainers. By 1963, the electronics division accounted for ⅓ of Marquardt&#x27;s total sales.

Also in 1958, Marquardt purchased the Cooper Development Corporation of Monrovia, California (CDC). Clifford D. Cooper, the founder and president, became a Marquardt vice-president. CDC manufactured high-altitude solid-fuel sounding and weather rockets. Cooper Development had been the company responsible for the upper stages of the missile used to place the first U.S. satellite in orbit - the Explorer I.

By 1959 the company had sales of $70 million (equal to over $600 million in 2020 dollars), and had purchased several other smaller aerospace firms. One of these purchases, Power Systems, led to a number of designs for small rocket motors used as positioning thrusters. This would eventually become one of Marquardt&#x27;s biggest and most important product lines in the 1960s. During this period the main Van Nuys plant was also involved in research into new systems, including a nuclear-powered ramjet for Project Pluto and a liquid air cycle engine (LACE) for the Air Force&#x27;s Aerospaceplane efforts. Another new product line started with the introduction of their first ram-air turbine, small air-powered generators for providing aircraft with electric power if the main engine failed. Marquardt also developed and produced thrust reversers for jet engines, as well as afterburners (which are functionally the same as a ramjet). With this diversification came a name change, to Marquardt Corporation.

In 1960, Marquardt established a small research laboratory in Maryland named &quot;Marquardt Special Projects Laboratory&quot; (MSPL), whose principal scientist was Dr. Oleg Enikeieff. Enikeiff, a 1943 graduate of California Institute of Technology, had joined Marquardt after being a research engineer for the Harry C. Miller Lock Company, the owner of Sargent Locks. Oleg&#x27;s expertise was centered on security devices, and some of his unclassified work while at MSPL included patents for an ID card identification system that would scramble its coded contents after each use so it could not be copied, as well as a system to jam microphones in rooms being used as secure locations, so they could not be &#x27;bugged&#x27;. Other work at MSPL was classified.

In 1962, Marquardt was licensed by the Southern Pacific Railroad to design and produce a device called the &quot;Grade Crossing Predictor&quot;, developed at Stanford University. Marquardt formed a subsidiary, Marquardt Industrial Products Company (MIPCO), as part of the Pomona, California electronics operations, and began selling the computer to major railroads across the country, and eventually world-wide. It enabled the warning lights and gates at grade-level crossings to be lowered based on the speed of an approaching train, rather than at a fixed distance, reducing grade-crossing congestion in populated areas like Chicago.

In 1964, Marquardt purchased a small aerospace firm in Mineola, New York named Automation Laboratories, Inc. (ALI), principally to use their television broadcast expertise in developing a missile launch simulator for the Sheridan Battle Tank. Marquardt had invented a hemispherical photographic system it named &quot;VueMarq&quot;, and the marriage of the &quot;VueMarq&quot; system with the ALI TV technology produced a very advanced &quot;Sheridan/Shillelagh&quot; gunnery simulator. Marquardt was not the successful bidder on the program, and later in 1965 after the GASL merger was completed, ALI was absorbed into GASL and disappeared as a stand-alone entity.

In 1965, Marquardt merged General Applied Science Laboratories, Inc. (GASL), of Westbury, New York, into the company. GASL had been founded in 1956 by Antonio Ferri and Theodore von Karman.

Von Karman was a Hungarian-born scientist who had emigrated to the United States in 1930. It was von Karman who founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL) at the California Institute of Technology in 1944.

Antonio Ferri was an Italian aerospace scientist who studied supersonic flight in Italy prior to World War II. Ferri had doctorates in both Aeronautical Engineering and Electrical Engineering from the University of Rome. During World War II, after the Germans invaded Italy, Ferri destroyed much of his laboratory equipment and hid his research papers from the Germans. Ferri was in hiding as part of a partisan group when President Roosevelt sent the American wartime spy Morris (Moe) Berg of the Office of Strategic Services (forerunner to the CIA) to Europe to convince Italian scientists to emigrate to the U.S., particularly the aeronautical genius Antonio Ferri. Berg had been a major-league catcher prior to the war, and when he returned with Ferri, President Roosevelt remarked &quot;... I see that Moe Berg is still catching very well&quot;. Ferri pioneered many breakthroughs in hypersonic flight, including Supersonic Combustion Ramjet (SCRAMJET) propulsion, and research into the proper shaping of airfoils, engine inlets, and hypersonic reentry phenomena. He was one of the early advocates of swept-back wings for high-speed aircraft.

In 1966, Marquardt bought The R. W. Neill Company in Chicago, a manufacturer of communications systems for railroads. Two smaller firms, Howard+Gould, and Western Industries, also in Chicago, were purchased and merged with R. W. Neill. The Neill company was operated as a subsidiary of the Industrial Products group, MIPCO.

=== Small Rocket Engines ===
In 1962 North American Aviation selected Marquardt to provide the reaction control system engines for the Apollo program spacecraft. 
By 1970 Marquardt was known primarily as &quot;the&quot; company for small rocket engines and thrusters. Practically all US space vehicles and satellites used their designs, eventually including a major win for the Space Shuttle program. The company developed and provided the 25 and 870 lb. thrusters for the space shuttle.

=== Research and Development Activities ===
In 1960, Roy Marquardt had told the employees of the company that government procurement of the Bomarc Missile would end in mid-1962, and that an effort must be made to replace that business. His solution was to use the great scientific and engineering capabilities of the company to develop new technologies. In a newsletter for summer, 1960, he said &quot;I believe that one of our more important actions this year has been to greatly increase company-sponsored and financed research and development, a program started late last year ... Much hard work lies ahead if we are to develop the programs and business replacing the Bomarc as it phases out...&quot;

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s, Marquardt and its subsidiaries were a hot bed of scientific research activity. Marquardt made significant advances in many fields, including space propulsion, medicine, optics, life in space, panoramic photography (the &quot;VueMarq&quot; System), transportation, hypersonic flight, high-temperature metallurgy, water desalination, slurry fuels, underwater propulsion, ram air turbines, afterburners and thrust-reversers for jet aircraft, computer storage, anti-mortar defense systems, FAX machines, television transmission, LED research, and devices as seemingly mundane as pick-up shoes for electric locomotives powered by third-rail power. Roy Marquardt had always believed that the primary mission of the company was &quot;Dedicated to Keeping the United States First in Technology&quot;. He kept a large roster of scientists and engineers in the company, and believed that the technical staff should make up about ⅓ of all the personnel of Marquardt. These large engineering and development costs taxed Marquardt&#x27;s profits, and although the company remained profitable throughout this period, by 1964 the board of directors hired a new president to change the focus toward more profitability. Unfortunately, this meant Marquardt would have to move forward with only the existing product offerings then being manufactured, with little hope of new breakthroughs and future growth. In 1966, the new president announced that in his first year (1965) he had increased profits in part by the &quot;... elimination of research and development efforts that weren&#x27;t directly related to the company&#x27;s current activities&quot;.

=== Decline of the Ramjet Market ===
The market for ramjet engines had largely disappeared by the mid-1960s due to increased performance from turbojet engines, and the belief that rockets were more appropriate for the nation&#x27;s defense. Marquardt continued low-level development on advanced designs. One system, developed in partnership with Morton Thiokol, placed a solid fuel booster inside the ramjet core. When the solid fuel burned out the ramjet would ignite as normal. The idea was to combine the booster and ramjet into a single airframe, thereby reducing cost, size, and range safety requirements, as nothing would be jettisoned in flight.

Marquardt took advantage of its advanced metal-forming talents to fill the void left by the end of Bomarc ramjet production. Products such as air inlets for the F-4 Phantom, cases for the submarine-launched Polaris missile, leading-edge slats for the Lockheed L-1011, and launch rocket motor cases for TOW missiles became main products of the firm.

However, the sales volume of the company was still below the peak of the early 60s, due to the end of the Bomarc program in Ogden and the B-52 bombardier/navigator simulator program in Pomona.

=== Mergers, Sale, and Break-up ===
In 1964, the board of directors appointed a new president, John B. Montgomery; the founder, Roy Marquardt, was retained as chairman of the board. The gradual reduction of the company&#x27;s focus on research and development was begun at that point to improve profitability. Pieces of Marquardt were then sold off over time.

In 1966, Marquardt sold the Pomona Electronics Division, excluding the Industrial Products subsidiary MIPCO, to Conductron, a subsidiary of McDonnell Aircraft. Conductron later became McDonnell-Douglas Electronics.

In 1967, both Dr. Antonio Ferri and Roy Marquardt resigned from the company, completely ending the founders&#x27; association with their firms. Roy Marquardt subsequently engaged in numerous charitable activities in the Los Angeles area, while Antonio Ferri became the Vincent Astor Professor of Aerospace Sciences at New York University.

In 1968 Marquardt merged with CCI Inc. in Tulsa, OK, and formed a new company CCI-Marquardt. This merger permitted CCI to become listed on the New York Stock Exchange, using the listing that had been Marquardt&#x27;s. Within a few years, the name of the company was changed back to &quot;CCI Inc.&quot; and the effort intensified to spin-off or sell the balance of Marquardt it had acquired in 1968.

Also in 1968, The R. W. Neill Company, part of the industrial products group MIPCO, was spun off for an undisclosed amount and became the Larry McGee Company. Larry McGee had been the vice-president of sales and marketing for R. W. Neill Company. The Larry McGee Company is now part of Miller Ingenuity in Minnesota.

General Applied Sciences Laboratories (GASL) in New York was divested. Its ownership has passed through a series of owners including GenCorp, Allied Aerospace, and Alliant Techsystems; it is now part of Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, located on eastern Long Island, New York.

Over the next few years, several additional parts of Marquardt were sold or spun off. In 1971 MIPCO (Marquardt Industrial Products Company) was combined with another CCI rail equipment subsidiary and named Safetran Systems, a company that has subsequently passed through several ownerships including Hawker Siddeley in England, and is now part of Siemens Rail Systems.

In 1971, Marquardt Marine Products Division was sold to Ametek. MMP had been formed originally to manufacture and market the doppler navigation products of the Janus Division of GASL in New York.

In 1973, CCI formed a company named CCI Life Products to develop and market a Marquardt-invented kidney dialysis machine. The device, using a method called &quot;sorbent dialysis&quot; had been developed by Marquardt while its scientists were conducting a study for NASA on water purification during long-duration space missions. In 1978 this subsidiary was sold to Akzo NV in the Netherlands, which became Organon Teknika. The &quot;REDY&quot; system for home dialysis was then marketed world-wide.

Finally, in 1983 the balance of the company was purchased by the ISC Defense and Space Group International Signal and Control. In 1987, ISC was purchased by British-based Ferranti.

=== Ferranti Bankruptcy ===
In 1989, Ferranti discovered a huge defense contract fraud at ISC amounting to $1-billion (perhaps equivalent to $3 billion in 2020 dollars), masterminded by James Guerin, ISC&#x27;s deputy chairman prior to the merger. Guerin subsequently received a 15-year prison sentence for fraud and arms smuggling. This led to a restructuring at Ferranti and the plan to sell off some of the assets they had acquired from ISC.

Ferranti declared bankruptcy in 1991. In August 1991 one of the main Marquardt businesses, the manufacturing of components for Rockeye cluster bombs and other weapons, was sold to a group of investors who formed a new company called Marquardt Manufacturing Inc. In December 1991, the other main business, a rocket-propulsion division, was sold to Kaiser Aerospace &amp; Electronics Corp. The original Marquardt Co. became principally a landlord, retaining ownership of 56 acres and several buildings near Van Nuys Airport. MMI and the original Marquardt Co. became embroiled in a lawsuit, which led to the bankruptcy and disappearance of Marquardt Manufacturing.

Kaiser reportedly picked up the Marquardt Jet Laboratory for a mere $1 million, with about $50 million in outstanding Space Shuttle contracts. Kaiser sold the bipropellant rocket engine product line to Primex Technologies in 2000 (now Aerojet Rocketdyne) and closed the Van Nuys plant in 2001.

With the sale of Kaiser-Marquardt and the thruster rocket business to Primex in 2000, the name Marquardt disappeared completely from American aerospace industry.

<text>Brewster Hopkinson Shaw Jr. (born May 16, 1945) is a retired NASA astronaut, U.S. Air Force colonel, and former executive at Boeing. Shaw was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame on May 6, 2006.

Shaw is a veteran of three Space Shuttle missions and has logged 533 hours of space flight. He was pilot of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in November 1983, commander of Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; in November 1985 and commander of &quot;Columbia&quot; in August 1989.

Following the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; accident in 1986, he supported the Rogers Presidential Commission investigating the accident. Shaw subsequently led the Space Shuttle Orbiter return-to-flight team chartered to enhance the safety of the vehicles’ operations.

Shaw worked as a manager at NASA until 1996 when he left the agency, retired from the Air Force and went to work in the private sector as an aerospace executive.

==Early life and education==
Shaw is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Brewster H. Shaw Sr. He was born May 16, 1945, and grew up in Michigan. He graduated from Cass City High School in Cass City, Michigan, in 1963. Shaw received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1968. He completed a Master of Science degree in Engineering Mechanics in 1969, also at UW-Madison. Shaw joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity while attending UW-Madison.

While attending college Shaw was the member of a band called The Gentlemen. He credits his flying career to a fellow band member: “Our drummer, Steve Schimming, had a private pilot’s license, and one day he took me up in his plane. From that moment on, I wanted to be a pilot.”

==U.S. Air Force pilot==
Shaw entered the Air Force in 1969 after completing Officer Training School and attended undergraduate pilot training at Craig Air Force Base, Alabama. He received his pilot wings in 1970 and was then assigned to the F-100 Replacement Training Unit at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.

In April 1973 Shaw reported to George Air Force Base, California, for F-4 instructor duties. Shaw attended the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, starting in July 1975. Following the completion of this training, he remained at Edwards as an operational test pilot. He served as an instructor at the USAF Test Pilot School from August 1977 to July 1978.

==NASA career==
Shaw was selected by NASA to be an astronaut in January 1978 where he served on loan from the Air Force.

===Space flight experience===

====STS-9====

Shaw&#x27;s first trip to space was as pilot on STS-9 &quot;Columbia&quot; from November 28 to December 8, 1983.

His fellow crew included Commander John W. Young, mission specialists Owen Garriott and Robert Parker, and payload specialists, Byron Lichtenberg and Ulf Merbold. This was the largest crew to fly aboard a single spacecraft, the first international Shuttle crew and the first to carry payload specialists.

The crew conducted more than seventy multi-disciplinary scientific and technical investigations in the fields of life sciences, atmospheric physics and earth observations, astronomy and solar physics, space plasma physics, and materials processing. After ten days of spacelab hardware verification and around-the-clock scientific operations, &quot;Columbia&quot; and its laboratory cargo (the heaviest payload to be returned to Earth in the shuttle&#x27;s cargo bay) returned to land on the dry lake bed at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

====STS-61B====

Brewster Shaw first served as shuttle commander on STS-61B &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The mission launched at night on November 26 and returned on December 3, 1985.

The crew included spacecraft commander Brewster Shaw; pilot, Bryan O&#x27;Connor; mission specialists, Mary Cleave, Jerry Ross, and Woody Spring; as well as payload specialists Rodolfo Neri Vela (Mexico), and Charles Walker (McDonnell Douglas).

During the mission the crew deployed the communications satellites, conducted two six-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CRFES) experiment for McDonnell Douglas and a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialists Experiments for the Mexican Government and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP). This was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date. After completing 108 orbits of the Earth in 165 hours, Shaw landed &quot;Atlantis&quot; on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

Brewster Shaw told the NASA oral historian for STS-61-B that he installed a padlock on the hatch control because he was “particularly concerned” that the Mexican Rodolfo Neri Vela could “flip out” during the mission. Shaw noted that he didn’t think that Neri Vela noticed the padlock at the time, but that other members of the crew did.

====STS-28====

Shaw was the commander of STS-28 &quot;Columbia&quot; (August 8–13, 1989). The mission included pilot Dick Richards and three mission specialists: Jim Adamson, Dave Leestma and Mark Brown. The shuttle carried classified Department of Defense payloads and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 orbits of Earth the five-day mission concluded with a dry lake bed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

===NASA management===
Shaw left the Johnson Space Center in October 1989 to assume the NASA Headquarters senior executive position of deputy director, Space Shuttle operations, located at the Kennedy Space Center. As operations manager, Shaw was responsible for all operational aspects of the Space Shuttle Program and had Level II authority over the Space Shuttle elements from the time the Orbiters left the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), were mated to the external tank and solid rocket boosters, transported to the launch pad, launched and recovered and returned to the Orbiter Processing Facility. He was the final authority for the launch decision, and chaired the Mission Management Team.

Shaw moved on to serve as the Deputy Program Manager, Space Shuttle, as a NASA Headquarters employee located at the Kennedy Space Center. In addition to the duties he previously held, he also shared with the Space Shuttle Program Manager, full authority and responsibility for the conduct of the Space Shuttle Program.

He then served as Director, Space Shuttle Operations, with responsibility for the development of all Space Shuttle elements, including the Orbiter, external tank, solid rocket boosters, Space Shuttle main engines, the facilities required to support mission operations and in the planning necessary to efficiently conduct Space Shuttle operations.

==Aerospace executive==

===Rockwell and Boeing===
Shaw joined Rockwell in 1996 after 27 years with the U.S. Air Force and NASA. The Boeing Company acquired Rockwell in December 1996.

Initially, Shaw served as director of major programs, Boeing Space and Defense Group. Then he became vice president and program manager of International Space Station (ISS) electrical power systems at Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power. The contract included the development, test, evaluation and production of the electrical power system to be assembled in space during multiple space shuttle launches. Shaw&#x27;s next role was to lead the consolidated Boeing teams at Huntsville, Alabama, Canoga Park and Huntington Beach, California, in the design, development, test, evaluation, production and flight preparation of ISS hardware and software. Boeing was NASA&#x27;s prime contractor and supplier for the ISS.

===United Space Alliance===
In mid-2003, Brewster Shaw left Boeing and became the chief operating officer of United Space Alliance (USA). In that position he had primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations and overall management of USA, the prime contractor for the Space Shuttle Program, and its 10,000 employees in Florida, Texas, Alabama and Russia.

===Return to Boeing===
In January 2006 he returned to the Boeing Company&#x27;s Houston campus, to serve as the Vice President &amp; General Manager of the division which controls Boeing&#x27;s International Space Station and Space Shuttle programs.

He retired from Boeing on August 26, 2011.

==Personal life==
He is married and is the father of three children. His youngest son, Brandon (born in 1976), was murdered by carjackers in Austin, Texas in July 1997.

Shaw is a descendant of William Brewster of the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Shaw has earned numerous honors and awards including 28 medals in Vietnam. He received the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross with 7 Oak Leaf Cluster and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.

<doc id="529634" wikidata="Q507046" url="?curid=529634" title="Owen Garriott">
<text>Owen Kay Garriott (November 22, 1930 – April 15, 2019) was an American electrical engineer and NASA astronaut, who spent 60 days aboard the Skylab space station in 1973 during the Skylab 3 mission, and 10 days aboard Spacelab-1 on a Space Shuttle mission in 1983.

After serving in the United States Navy, Garriott was an engineering professor at Stanford University before attending the United States Air Force Pilot Training Program and later joining NASA. After his NASA career, he worked for various aerospace companies, consulted on NASA-related committees, taught as an adjunct professor, and conducted research on microbes found in extreme environments.

==Early life==
Owen Kay Garriott was born in Enid, Oklahoma, on November 22, 1930, to Owen (1909–1981) and Mary Catherine Garriott (; 1912–1993). Owen&#x27;s middle name was based on his mother&#x27;s middle name. He was a Boy Scout (earning the rank of Star Scout), and graduated from Enid High School in 1948, where he served as senior class president and was voted &quot;Most Likely To Succeed.&quot; He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering from the University of Oklahoma in 1953, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. He was also the elected president of the senior class. He later earned Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees from Stanford University in electrical engineering in 1957 and 1960, respectively.

== Career ==
=== U.S. military ===
Garriott served as electronics officer in the United States Navy from 1953 to 1956. From 1961 through 1965, he was an assistant professor and associate professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. He performed research and led graduate studies in ionospheric physics after obtaining his doctorate, and authored or co-authored more than 45 scientific papers, chapters and one book, principally in areas of the physical sciences.

As a prerequisite of the era&#x27;s scientist-astronaut training, he completed a one-year United States Air Force pilot training program in 1966, receiving qualification as pilot in jet aircraft.

===NASA===
In 1965, Garriott was one of the six scientist-astronauts selected by NASA. His first spaceflight, the Skylab 3 mission in 1973, set a world record for duration of approximately 60 days, more than double the previous record. Extensive experiments were conducted of the Sun, of Earth resources and in various life sciences relating to human adaptation to weightlessness.

His second space flight was aboard STS-9 (Spacelab-1) in 1983, a multidisciplinary and international mission of 10 days aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Over 70 separate experiments in six different disciplines were conducted, primarily to demonstrate the suitability of Spacelab for research in all these areas. Garriott was also an Extra Class amateur radio operator holding call sign W5LFL. He operated the world&#x27;s first amateur radio station in space and, on December 1, 1983, made the first amateur radio contact from space using a Motorola handheld 2-meter radio while on board the STS-9 Space Shuttle Columbia mission. Amateur radio subsequently expanded into an important activity on dozens of shuttle flights, Space Station Mir and the International Space Station, with scores of astronauts and cosmonauts participating.

Between these missions, Garriott received a NASA fellowship in the Space Station Project Office. In this position, he worked closely with the external scientific communities and advised the project manager concerning the scientific suitability of the space station design.

Garriott held the distinction of being the NASA astronaut with the earliest-obtained PhD degree, having earned his PhD from Stanford University in 1960, two years before Robert A. Parker who obtained his PhD from Caltech in 1962.

===The Skylab &quot;stowaway&quot; prank===
On September 10, 1973, controllers in Houston were startled to hear a woman&#x27;s voice beaming down from Skylab. The voice startled capsule communicator (CAPCOM) Bob Crippen by calling him by name, and then the woman explained: &quot;The boys haven&#x27;t had a home-cooked meal in so long I thought I&#x27;d bring one up.&quot; After several minutes in which she described forest fires seen from space and the beautiful sunrise, the woman said: &quot;Oh oh. I have to cut off now. I think the boys are floating up here toward the command module and I&#x27;m not supposed to be talking to you.&quot; As the Skylab astronauts later revealed, Garriott had recorded his wife, Helen, during a private radio transmission the night before.

===Post-NASA career===
After leaving NASA in June 1986, Garriott consulted for various aerospace companies and served as a member of several NASA and National Research Council Committees.

From January 1988 until May 1993, he was vice president of space programs at Teledyne Brown Engineering. This division, which grew to over 1,000 people, provided payload integration for all Spacelab projects at the Marshall Space Flight Center and had a substantial role in the development of the U.S. laboratory for the International Space Station.

Garriott devoted time to several charitable activities in his hometown, including the Enid Arts and Sciences Foundation of which he was a co-founder in 1992. Later, he accepted a position as adjunct professor in the Laboratory for Structural Biology at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and participated in research activities there involving new microbes he returned from extreme environments such as very alkaline lakes and deep sea hydrothermal vents. Hyperthermophiles were returned from several dives in Russian MIR submersibles to the Rainbow Vent Field at a depth of 2,300 meters near the Azores in the central Atlantic Ocean. Other research activities included three trips to Antarctica from which 20 meteorites were returned for laboratory study. Garriott formed a 501(c)(3) public philanthropic Garriott Family Foundation to finance the aforementioned adventure travel for himself, his wife and other members of his family.

== Personal life and death ==

Garriott married Helen Mary Walker, his high school sweetheart, in 1952. They had four children, including Robert Garriott and Richard Garriott. After he divorced his first wife, Garriott married Evelyn L. Garriott, who had three children from a previous relationship.

His son Richard was launched as a space tourist on board Soyuz TMA-13 on October 12, 2008, the first American and the second person worldwide to follow a parent into space. Owen Garriott was in mission control at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the launch and was in attendance when his son returned 12 days later.

Garriott died on April 15, 2019, at his home in Huntsville, Alabama.

==Organizations==
Garriott was a member of the following organizations: American Astronautical Society (fellow), American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (associate fellow), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, American Geophysical Union, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Association of Space Explorers (Board of Directors), Astronaut Scholarship Foundation (vice president and vice chairman).
==Awards and honors==
Garriott received the following honors: National Science Foundation Fellowship, 1960–1961; Honorary Doctorate of Science, Phillips University (Enid, Okla.), 1973; NASA Distinguished Service Medal, 1973; Fédération Aéronautique Internationale V. M. Komarov Diploma for 1973; the Octave Chanute Award for 1975; and the NASA Space Flight Medal, 1983.

The three Skylab astronaut crews were awarded the 1973 Collier Trophy &quot;For proving beyond question the value of man in future explorations of space and the production of data of benefit to all the people on Earth.&quot; Gerald Carr accepted the 1975 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Memorial Trophy from President Ford, awarded to the Skylab astronauts.

He was one of five Oklahoman astronauts inducted into the Oklahoma Aviation and Space Hall of Fame in 1980, the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997, the Oklahoma Military Hall of Fame in 2000, and the Enid Public Schools Hall of Fame in 2001.

Garriott was presented an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Phillips University in 1973.

A street named after him in Enid, Oklahoma, serves as one of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares. It is part of U.S. Route 412.

==Books==
Garriott was co-author, with fellow astronaut Joseph Kerwin and writer David Hitt, of &quot;Homesteading Space&quot;, a history of the Skylab program, published in 2008. He was co-author of &quot;Introduction to Ionospheric Physics&quot; with Henry Rishbeth. Garriott was also a contributor to the book &quot;NASA&#x27;s Scientist-Astronauts&quot; by David Shayler and Colin Burgess. Garriott wrote the foreword to the book.

The Puffing Billy Railway is a heritage steam-operated railway, opened in 1900, which runs between Belgrave and Gembrook, recreating the 1920s heyday of this narrow-gauge line. It has three stations within Emerald: at Emerald itself, Nobelius and Lakeside, with Nobelius being a &quot;stops-if-required&quot; station. There is also Nobelius Siding, located at the former Nobelius Nurseries Packing Shed, between Emerald and Nobelius stations. It is only used for functions, or the regular &quot;Dinner Train&quot;.

===Other attractions===

The areas around Emerald are excellent for finding chanterelles and other edible mushrooms, and are a popular destination for mushroom hunters each autumn. 

There is also an Emerald and District museum set in the Nobelius Heritage Park. It adjoins Emerald Lake Park.

<text>The British Columbia Institute of Technology (also referred to as BCIT), is a public polytechnic institute in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. The technical institute has five campuses located in the Metro Vancouver region, with its main campus in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. There is also the Aerospace Technology Campus in Richmond, the Marine Campus in the City of North Vancouver, Downtown campus in Vancouver, and Annacis Island Campus in Delta. It is provincially chartered through legislation in the &quot;College and Institute Act.&quot; The school operates as a vocational and technical school, offering apprenticeships for the skilled trades and diplomas and degrees in vocational education for skilled technicians and workers in professions such as engineering, accountancy, business administration, broadcast/media communications, digital arts, nursing, computing, medicine, architecture, and law.

BCIT was first established as the British Columbia Vocational School in 1960. When BCIT opened its Burnaby campus in 1964, initial enrollment was 498 students. , enrollment has swelled to 18,755 full-time students and 30,593 part-time students. Since its foundation, the institution has been home to over 125,000 alumni.

==History==
===Establishment===
In 1960, the British Columbia Vocational School (BCVS) was established in Burnaby, opening at Willingdon and Canada Way. It was the first permanent trades school of its kind in British Columbia; its programs included carpentry, welding and aircraft maintenance. A year later, plans were announced to establish the British Columbia Institute of Technology on adjacent land. It was the first provincial institution dedicated to advanced technical education in BC, and its principal was named in 1962. It offered education in the areas of engineering, business and health, enrolling 498 students in 1964. In 1966, it celebrated its first graduates.

===Expansion and growth===
By 1975, enrolment grew to 3,200 students. BCIT&#x27;s first Board of Governors was formed in 1974, and in 1977, the school established a campus on Sea Island in Richmond. In 1979, the BCIT Alumni Association was formed. A year later, the BCVS and the Haney Educational Centre amalgamated to form the Pacific Vocational Institute (PVI).

In 1986, PVI merged with BCIT, incorporating PVI&#x27;s satellite facilities such as the Aircraft Maintenance Centre at Vancouver International Airport. Legislative changes came in 1989 when BCIT&#x27;s mandate was broadened to include applied research, and the Technology Centre, a facility for multi-disciplinary research and development, was established. BCIT would be the province&#x27;s focal point for applied technology transfer.

===Recent history===
In 1994, the Pacific Marine Training Institute amalgamated with BCIT, along with its nautical engineering programs. The first Bachelor of Technology degree in Environmental Engineering was awarded in 1996. 1997 marked the opening of the Downtown Vancouver campus to accommodate expansion of BCIT&#x27;s part-time programs.

BCIT&#x27;s Arms, Supporters, Flag and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 29, 1996.

BCIT, UBC, SFU, and ECUAD jointly opened the Great Northern Way Campus in 2002. In 2004, the number of students grew to more than 48,000, and the polytechnic status of the institution was enshrined in provincial legislation. A year later, a Research Services Office was opened to further support applied research.

BCIT opened a new Aerospace Technology Campus in 2007, at the gateway to Vancouver International Airport for its aerospace programs.

==Campus==

The British Columbia Institute of Technology has six campuses across the Metro Vancouver area. BCIT&#x27;s main campus is located in the City of Burnaby. It operates an aerospace technology campus in the City of Richmond, a marine campus is located in the City of North Vancouver, and a heavy-duty trades campus on Annacis Island, in City of Delta.

<text>The Armistice Day Blizzard (or the Armistice Day Storm) took place in the Midwest region of the United States on November 11 (Armistice Day) and November 12, 1940. The intense early-season &quot;panhandle hook&quot; winter storm cut a swath through the middle of the country from Kansas to Michigan.

==Meteorological synopsis==
On November 7, 1940, the low pressure system that later developed into the storm was affecting the Pacific Northwest and produced the winds that destroyed the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. On November 10 the fast-moving storm crossed the Rocky Mountains in just two hours on its way to the Midwest.

The morning of November 11, 1940, brought with it unseasonably high temperatures in the Upper Midwest. By early afternoon, temperatures approached over most of the affected region. However, as the day wore on conditions quickly deteriorated. Severe weather was reported across much of the Midwest with heavy rain and snow, a tornado, and gale-force winds were all reported. Temperatures dropped sharply, winds picked up and rain, followed by sleet and then snow, began to fall. An intense low pressure system tracked from the southern plains northeastward into western Wisconsin, pulling Gulf of Mexico moisture up from the South and pulling down a cold arctic air mass from the North.

The result was a raging blizzard that would last into the next day. Snowfalls of up to , winds of , snow drifts, and temperature drops were common over parts of the states of Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In Minnesota, of snow fell at Collegeville, and the Twin Cities recorded . Record low pressures were recorded in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and Duluth, Minnesota. Transportation and communications were crippled, which made finding the dead and injured more difficult. The Armistice Day Blizzard ranks #2 in Minnesota&#x27;s list of the top five weather events of the 20th century.

Survivors describe the cold as so severe that it was difficult to breathe, with the air so moisture-laden it was thick like syrup and that the cold seared the survivors&#x27; lungs like a red-hot blade. Many individuals claim that animals were aware of the upcoming weather shifts which led to animals moving rapidly from the area. Duck hunters who were out at the time were amazed at the number of ducks that were in the area, and on the move through the skies, one survivor recounted that there were thousands. Future Minnesota Vikings coach Bud Grant was caught in this storm while duck hunting. Grant was able to find shelter at a nearby gas station and ride out the blizzard.

==Casualties==
A total of 146 deaths were blamed on the storm, with the following instances being noteworthy: 
*Along the Mississippi River several hundred duck hunters had taken time off from work and school to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result many of the hunters were not dressed for cold weather. When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the winds and waves overcame their encampments. Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death as temperatures went below overnight. Others tried to make it to shore and drowned. Duck hunters constituted about half of the 49 deaths in Minnesota. Those who survived told of how ducks came south with the storm by the thousands, and everybody could have shot their daily limit had they not been focused on survival. 
*Casualties were lessened by the efforts of Max Conrad, a pioneering light plane pilot and flight school owner and John R. &quot;Bob&quot; Bean (one of the flight school instructors) both based in Winona, Minnesota. They flew up and down the river in the wake of the storm, locating survivors and dropping supplies to them. Both men were nominated for the Carnegie Medal for their heroism.
*One survivor, Gerald Tarras, survived the storm in Minneapolis due to the two family Labrador retriever dogs who lay beside him and provided body heat to protect him.
*In Watkins, Minnesota, 2 people died when a passenger train and a freight train collided in the blinding snow. Watkins residents formed a human chain to lead the passengers to safety.
*In Lake Michigan, 66 sailors died in the sinking of three freighters, the SS &quot;Anna C. Minch&quot;, the SS &quot;Novadoc&quot;, and the SS &quot;William B. Davock&quot;, and two smaller boats.
*13 people died in Illinois, 13 in Wisconsin, and 4 in Michigan.
Additionally, 1.5 million turkeys intended for Thanksgiving dinners across Minnesota perished from exposure to the cold conditions.

==Aftermath==
Prior to this event, all of the weather forecasts for the region originated in Chicago. After the failure to provide an accurate forecast for this blizzard, forecasting responsibilities were expanded to include 24-hour coverage and more forecasting offices were created, yielding more accurate local forecasts.

The U.S. Weather Bureau was criticized that it failed to predict the huge blizzard and officials released a statement that they were aware that the storm was coming but wrong about its strength and scope. The Twin Cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul) branch of Meteorology was upgraded to issue forecasts and not rely on the Chicago site.

<text>Matthew Whitworth-Aylmer, 5th Baron Aylmer, (24 May 1775 – 23 February 1850) was a British military officer and colonial administrator.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Aylmer was gazetted ensign in 1787, lieutenant in 1791 and major in 1800, after being held in a French prison for six months in 1798. His career continued as colonel in 1810, being aide-de-camp to King George III between 1810 and 1812 and then major general in 1813. He was present at most of the battles in the Peninsular War.

In 1814, following service in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, he was appointed adjutant general of British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823.

==North American administration==
After reaching the position of lieutenant-general in 1825, Aylmer was, in 1830, appointed commander of British military forces in North America as well as Governor General of British North America and Lieutenant Governor of Lower Canada.

Lord Aylmer had no previous experience as a civil administrator and no political experience. He was unable to pacify the growing demands in Lower Canada for responsible government and, in 1834, the radical Assembly of Lower Canada passed 92 &quot;resolutions of grievance&quot; including a demand that Aylmer be recalled. Lord Aylmer exacerbated ethnic tensions in Lower Canada by favouring the English over the French. The deterioration of the situation led to his recall in 1835. His administration may have been a contributing factor to the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837.

==Return to England==
Returning to England, Aylmer was promoted to the rank of general in 1845, but he never obtained a British peerage (his dignity was in the Irish peerage) or another administrative post.

He died at 15 Eaton Square, Belgravia, on 23 February 1850 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery.

Aylmer&#x27;s sister Rose Aylmer was the inspiration behind the poem of that name by Walter Savage Landor.

==Family==

His sister was Rose Whitworth-Aylmer who travelled with their aunt, Anne Barbara, and her husband Sir Henry Russell, 1st Baronet to India in 1798. She fell ill with cholera and died in 1800. She has been immortalized by his friend and the famous British poet Walter Savage Landor in his Rose Aylmer eulogy.

General the Right Honourable Matthew Whitworth, 5th Lord Aylmer, G.C.B., married Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call, Bart. on 4 August 1801. When her husband was appointed in 1830 to administer the government of Canada, as Governor-General, from February 1831 to August 1835, the couple entertained at the Castle of St. Louis, Quebec. During the cholera epidemic of 1831–32, she was interested in the relief of the sufferers. Since she was interested in education, she regularly visited and bestowed prizes in the schools. She served as the patroness of the Societe d&#x27;Education sous la direction des dames de Quebec. She died on 13 August 1862.

<doc id="529659" wikidata="Q4999222" url="?curid=529659" title="Burlington College">
<text>Burlington College was a private college in Burlington, Vermont. It offered associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees, as well as several professional certificates. Although regionally accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges, the college was placed on probation in July 2014 for failing to meet the accreditor&#x27;s standards regarding financial resources. The college ceased operations in 2016.

==History==
Burlington College started in 1972 as the Vermont Institute of Community Involvement. A handful of students met in the living room of founder Dr. Steward LaCasce. It originally served adult learners and veterans.

In 2007, the college had 204 students at its main campus in buildings in downtown Burlington. Since most were part-time, this worked out to 130 &quot;full-time equivalents.&quot; An additional 30 students studied off-campus.

In 2010, Jane O&#x27;Meara Sanders oversaw the purchase of 33 acres of property to be used for college expansion, with the resulting significant debt to be covered by already pledged donations and tuition from planned increased enrollment over five years. Sanders departed shortly after, with Christine Plunkett assuming the position of president.

In 2014, the regional accreditor of the college placed it on probation because of its financial condition, and votes of no confidence were given to Plunkett from organizations representing students, faculty, and staff. She resigned shortly thereafter. In 2015, the college sold 27.5 acres of the land it had purchased a few years prior. 

In May 2016, the college board of trustees decided to close the school. According to David A. Graham, writing in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, some of the school&#x27;s financial difficulties dated back to 2010 when the board of directors and Sanders purchased the property. The original $11 million of debt had been worked down to about $2 million, but because of remaining debt and &quot;insufficient financial resources,&quot; the school&#x27;s bank declined to renew their $1 million line of credit, and the school was facing the loss of their accreditation. Local Burlington developer Eric Farrell planned to purchase the campus from the bank to develop a park and housing.

===Presidents===
# 1972–1994: J. Steward LaCasce
# 1994–2002: Daniel Casey
# 2002–2003: Mary Clancy
# 2004–2011: Jane O&#x27;Meara Sanders
# 2012–2014: Christine Plunkett
# 2014: Michael Smith (interim)
# 2014–2016: Carol A. Moore

==Campus==
In 2011, the college sold its original campus to the Committee for Temporary Shelter, a welfare agency, and purchased of waterfront property from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington for use as its main campus. This new campus was located on North Avenue.

In 2015, the college sold a parcel of land, as well as the former diocesan orphanage attached to the office and classroom building, to a local developer, Farrell Real Estate. The developer drafted a master plan to convert the orphanage into student housing. The college retained the original diocese building for classrooms, studios, art rooms, film and radio, laboratories, and other facilities.

At the press conference announcing the closure, the school stated that the developer would purchase the rest of the college&#x27;s campus from the bank.

==Academics==
Burlington College offered a range of undergraduate programs in the arts, writing and literature, film studies, photography, fine arts, legal studies, transpersonal psychology/psychology, human services, media activism, and graphic design. It also provided individualized undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The college offered study-abroad options in Europe, and in 2008, Burlington College became one of the few universities in the United States to offer a study-abroad program in Havana, Cuba in conjunction with the University of Havana. Students could spend a semester at the university or participate in one of several one-week trips offered throughout the academic year. Burlington College joined several other universities in the United States by offering students the option of a narrative evaluation in addition to traditional transcripts.

In connection with the undergraduate legal studies program, Burlington College had an articulation agreement with Vermont Law School that allowed Burlington College graduates to proceed into the Juris Doctor and joint Juris Doctor programs at Vermont Law School upon successful completion of their undergraduate studies. Burlington College also had an affiliation with the Vermont Woodworking School in Fairfax. Courses in woodworking and fine craftsmanship were offered for credit to support both Associate of Arts and Bachelor of Fine Arts degree programs. In addition to woodworking skills, students took the usual general education requirements of the college. The degree could be pursued on campus, at a distance, or in combination.

Burlington College also offered a low-residency Master of Arts degree. This degree was individualized and tailored to meet the academic needs and focus of individual graduate students.

===Rankings===
In August 2011, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Burlington College as the number one school in the United States for free-spirited students. They defined free-spirited schools as those where &quot;there are no mandatory classes, tests, or official letter or number grades&quot;.

In October 2013, &quot;Newsweek&quot; named Burlington College as one of the 10 colleges in the United States with the highest rate of student participation in internships in their field of study.

<doc id="529666" wikidata="Q1124888" url="?curid=529666" title="CEDA">
<text>The Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (, CEDA) was a Spanish right-wing political party in the Second Spanish Republic. A Catholic conservative force, it was the political heir to Ángel Herrera Oria&#x27;s Acción Popular and defined itself in terms of the &#x27;affirmation and defence of the principles of Christian civilization,&#x27; translating this theoretical stand into a political demand for the revision of the anti-Catholic passages of the republican constitution. CEDA saw itself as a defensive organisation, formed to protect religious toleration, family, and private property rights.

The CEDA claimed that it was defending the Catholic Church in Spain and Christian civilization against authoritarian socialism, state atheism, and religious persecution. It would ultimately become the most popular individual party in Spain in the 1936 elections. The party represented the interests of the Catholic voters as well as the rural population of Spain, most prominently the medium and small peasants and landowners. The party sought the restoration of the powerful role of the Catholic Church that existed in Spain before the establishment of the Republic, and based their program solely on Catholic teaching, calling for land redistribution and industrial reform based on the distributist and corporatist ideals of Rerum Novarum and Quadragesimo Anno.

==The CEDA eclipses the republican centre==
Gil Robles set up CEDA to contest the 1933 Spanish general election. Despite dismissing the idea of a party as a &#x27;rigid fiction&#x27;, the CEDA leaders created a stable party organisation which would lead the Spanish right into the age of mass politics. The CEDA was constructed around organisational units known as Derechas Autónomas, the first of which had been established in Salamanca in December 1932. Having accepted the &quot;principles of Christian civilization&quot;, confederated bodies retained full freedom both of thought and of action – such a definition was framed with the Carlists in mind. The right would work together for &#x27;the radical transformation of the regime.&#x27; October 1933 announcement of a snap general election in November brought about an unprecedented mobilization of the Spanish right. &quot;El Debate&quot; instructed its readers to make the coming elections into an &quot;obsession&quot;, the &quot;sublime culmination of citizenly duties,&quot; so that victory in the polls would bring an end to the republican &quot;bienio rojo&quot;. Great emphasis was placed on the techniques of electoral campaigning. A national electoral committee was established, comprising CEDA, Alfonsist, Traditionalist, and Agrarian representatives – but excluding Miguel Maura&#x27;s Conservative Republicans. The CEDA swamped entire localities with electoral publicity. The party produced ten million leaflets, together with some two hundred thousand coloured posters and hundreds of cars were used to distribute this material through the provinces. In all of the major cities propaganda films were shown around the streets on screens mounted on large lorries.

==The polarization of political opinions and the CEDA==
The need for unity was the constant theme of the campaign fought by the CEDA and the election was presented as a confrontation of ideas, not of personalities. The electors&#x27; choice was simple: they voted for redemption or revolution and they voted for Christianity or Communism. The fortunes of Republican Spain, according to one of its posters had been decided by &#x27;immorality and anarchy&#x27;. Catholics who continued to proclaim their republicanism were moved into the revolutionary camp and many speeches argued that the Catholic republican option had become totally illegitimate. &#x27;A good Catholic may not vote for the Conservative Republican party&#x27; declared a &quot;Gaceta Regional&quot; editorial and the impression was given that Conservative Republicans, far from being Catholics, were in fact anti-religious. In this all-round attack on the political centre, the mobilization of women also became a major electoral tactic of the Catholic right. The &quot;Asociación Femenina de Educación&quot; had been formed in October 1931. As the 1933 general election approached women were warned that unless they voted correctly communism would come &quot; which will tear your children from your arms, your parish church will be destroyed, the husband you love will flee from your side authorized by the divorce law, anarchy will come to the countryside, hunger and misery to your home.&quot;

AFEC orators and organisers urged women to vote &#x27;For God and for Spain!&#x27; Mirroring the female qualities emphasized by AFEC the CEDA&#x27;s self-styled &quot;sección de defensa&quot; brought young male activists to the fore. In one incident in the last week of the campaign, in Guijuelo the efforts of a group of left wing sympathisers to prevent people entering the bullring, where José María Lamamié de Clairac was speaking, led to a running battle with CEDA&#x27;s &quot;sección de defensa&quot;. Later stopped and searched they were found to be carrying a quantity of pizzle whips – (bullwhips made from the dried penises of bulls) – taken along to &#x27;fend off the violence which had been promised.&#x27; It was one example of the polarisation of political opinions which had occurred in the province of Salamanca, Robles&#x27;s province, since the early days of the Republic. This new CEDA squad was also very much in evidence on election day itself, when its members patrolled the streets and polling stations in the provincial capital, supposedly to prevent the left from tampering with the ballot boxes.

In the 1933 elections, the CEDA won the most seats in the Cortes in no small part because the massive CNT membership abstained, holding true to their anarchist principles. The CEDA had won a plurality of seats; however, these were not enough to form a majority, but then President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government and instead invited the Radical Republican Party&#x27;s Alejandro Lerroux to do so. CEDA supported the centrist government led by Lerroux; it later demanded and, on October 1, 1934, received three ministerial positions. They suspended most of the reforms of the previous Manuel Azaña government, provoking an armed miners&#x27; rebellion in Asturias on October 6, and an independentist rebellion in Catalonia—both rebellions were suppressed (the Asturias rebellion by young General Francisco Franco), being followed by mass political arrests and trials. CEDA continued to mimic the German Nazi Party, Robles staging a rally in March 1934, to shouts of &quot;Jefe&quot; (&quot;Chief&quot;, after the Italian &quot;Duce&quot; used in support of Mussolini). Robles used anti-strike law to pick union leaders off one by one, and attempted to undermine the republican government of the Republican Left of Catalonia, who attempted to continue the republic&#x27;s previous reforms. Using the title &quot;jefe&quot;, the JAP created an intense and often disturbing cult around the figure of Gil Robles.

Stanley Payne argues that CEDA was neither fascist nor democratic. Payne argues that CEDA&#x27;s goal was to win power through legal means and to then enact a constitutional revision that would protect property and religion and alter the basic political system. They would create neither a fascist state nor an absolute monarchy but a Catholic, corporative republic. While this would entail the limitation of direct democratic rights, it would not be a state in the style of Hitler or Mussolini&#x27;s but probably closer to the neighbouring Portuguese &quot;Estado Novo&quot;.

The &quot;Juventudes de Acción Popular&quot;, the youth wing within the CEDA, &quot;soon developed its own character. The JAP emphasized sporting and political activity. It had its own fortnightly paper, the first issue of which proclaimed: &#x27;We want a new state.&#x27; The JAP&#x27;s distaste for the principles of universal suffrage was such that internal decisions were never voted upon. As the thirteenth point of the JAP put it: &quot;Anti-parliamentarianism. Anti-dictatorship. The people participating in Government in an organic manner, not by degenerate democracy.&quot; The JAP held a series of rallies during the course of 1934.

On 26 September, the CEDA announced it would no longer support the RRP&#x27;s minority government; it was replaced by a RRP cabinet, led by Lerroux once more, that included three members of the CEDA.

==Rifts and civil war==

Between November 1934 and March 1935, the CEDA minister for agriculture, Manuel Giménez Fernández, introduced into parliament a series of agrarian reform measures designed to better conditions in the Spanish countryside. These moderate proposals met with a hostile response from reactionary elements within the Cortes, including the conservative wing of the CEDA and the proposed reform was defeated. A change of personnel in the ministry also followed. The agrarian reform bill proved to be a catalyst for a series of increasingly bitter divisions within the Catholic right, rifts that indicated that the broad based CEDA alliance was disintegrating. Partly as a result of the impetus of the JAP, the Catholic party had been moving further to the right, forcing the resignation of moderate government figures, including Filiberto Villalobos. Gil-Robles was not prepared to return the agriculture portfolio to Giménez Fernández. &quot;For all the social Catholic rhetoric, the extreme right had won the day.&quot;

Lerroux&#x27;s Radical government collapsed after two large scandals, the Straperlo affair and the Nombela scandal. However, Zamora did not allow the CEDA to form a government, and called elections. The elections of February 16, 1936 were narrowly won by the Popular Front, with vastly smaller resources than the political right, who followed Nazi propaganda techniques. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced Gil Robles as the right&#x27;s leading spokesman in parliament. The Falange expanded massively, and thousands of the JAP joined the organisation (though the majority of the JAP seem to have abandoned politics). They successfully created a sense of militancy on the streets, in order to make an authoritarian regime justifiable. CEDA came under direct attack from the Falange. This rapid radicalization of the CEDA youth movement effectively meant that all attempts to save parliamentary Catholicism were doomed to failure.

CEDA played no official role in the military uprising that sparked the Spanish Civil War. However, some of the party&#x27;s leaders, such as Gil Robles, were aware of the conspiracy in the army and tried to moderate it. Gil Robles met with Manuel Fal Conde, and offered CEDA&#x27;s support to the uprising if the rebels were to agree to hand power over to a civilian government as soon as control was established. However, the conspirators rejected this condition. On the eve of the civil war, the CEDA as a whole persisted in legalism and opposition to overthrowing the republic. Historian Samuel M. Pierce wrote that &quot;there is little evidence of widespread support for the conspiracy among local cedistas&quot;.

Once the civil war started, Gil Robles appealed to the party members to &quot;not take part in possible organizations of repression&quot;. CEDA became the target of attack in some Republican-controlled zones, with many party members, such as Dimas de Madariaga, being killed by Republican militias. Others sought refuge in foreign embassies, such as Francisco Casares. Other CEDA members came to believe that CEDA had become relevant and joined the rebels - this course of action was taken by Franco&#x27;s co-brother-in-law Ramón Serrano Suñer, who ended up becoming chief of the political junta of the FET y de las JONS. In the course of the civil war, the Communist Party of Spain took over the party&#x27;s headquarters in Madrid and destroyed its archives.

In April 1937, the rebel leader Francisco Franco issued the Unification Decree which laid out the creation of the FET y de las JONS upon the merging of the Fascist FE de las JONS and the traditionalist carlists, outlawing the rest of political parties in the rebel-controlled territory. As result, CEDA ceased to exist.

==Aftermath==
Francisco Franco and the rest of the military did not trust CEDA, seeing Gil Robles as a potential rival. This led to his exile to Portugal. Apart from Suñer, very few CEDA members achieved high positions in the new military government. Historian Carles Viver Pi-Sunyer found that only 8.6% of the Franco&#x27;s government officials were former CEDA members. CEDA was not trusted because it was considered to have worked too closely with the Republican government.

After the civil war, many former CEDA members emerged as critics of the Francoist regime, including Gil Robles, Jesús Pabón, and Manuel Giménez Fernández. In 1944, Francoist police investigated CEDA members who stayed in Spain, including Cándido Casanueva y Gorjón, on suspicion of organizing resistance against the government; this led to several arrests. In the 1960s and 1970s, former CEDA cadres participated in the anti-Francoist Christian Democracy movement, and after the death of Franco, Gil Robles founded the Democratic People&#x27;s Federation and took part in the 1977 Spanish general election.

==Ideology==
The party&#x27;s program followed Catholic social teaching - on economic issues, the party based their proposals on the encyclicals of Leo XIII and Pius XI and sought to compete left-wing parties for working-class support. CEDA disavowed class struggle, recognized the right of women to work outside the home, insisted on the imposition of the family wage, and advocated an egalitarian distribution of land in order to create a large class of smallholders, along distributist and corporatist principles. On social issues, CEDA called for respect of the autonomy of the Catholic Church, including allowing the Church to purchase and own property. It also postulated freedom of religious orders, a new concordat, and the need to maintain &quot;friendly relations in such matters as interest the Church and the State, and for the liquidation of the sectarian legislation that the Governments of the Republic have been dictating unilaterally&quot;.

According to Jay P. Corrin, CEDA &quot;was a party of moderate Catholic opinion, and many of its members were prepared to support the Republic.&quot; Juan J. Linz described the party as &quot;the rightist center&quot; of the Spanish Republic. It supported accidentalism, in that it treated the form of the Spanish government irrelevant as long as it protected Catholic interests. It had to accommodate conflicting interests, as while papal encyclicals Rerum Novarum and Quadragesimo Anno called for redistribution of landed wealth and industrial reform that would favor the workers, CEDA was also sponsored by the landed oligarchy. Lastly, while the party favored republicanism, its commitment was faint-hearted, as the main goal of the party was the restoration of the Catholic Church to its former position of dominance. Nevertheless, the party did oppose military government.
