<text>&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; 1981 radio series is an epic fantasy adventure for BBC Radio 4, adapted from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1955 novel of the same name. It is the third radio dramatisation of the novel, following a 1955 BBC Radio adaptation, and a 1979 adaptation for NPR in the United States.

Like the novel on which it is based, the radio series tells the story of an epic struggle between the Dark Lord Sauron of Mordor, the primary villain of the work, and an alliance of heroes who join forces to save the world from falling under his shadow.

== Development ==

=== Early stages and commissioning ===

The BBC entered negotiations with The Saul Zaentz Company to obtain the radio rights to adapt &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in 1979, following the release of the Ralph Bakshi animated film. J. R. R. Tolkien had sold the film, stage and merchandising rights to United Artists in 1969, who had subsequently sold them to The Saul Zaentz Company in 1976. The negotiations were protracted but ironically entirely unnecessary as the radio rights had never passed to the film company and were still controlled by the Tolkien estate.

Brian Sibley was a young scriptwriter who had written a number of radio features for the BBC, but lacked experience adapting works of literature, having previously only adapted a short fantasy by James Thurber. In 1979, Sibley submitted an idea for an original radio drama to Head of Drama Script Unit, Richard Imison, but was rejected. In his rejection letter, Imison asked Sibley to suggest a list of novels he would like to see adapted. Sibley submitted “about a baker’s dozen” suggestions, and added &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in a postscript, declaring it “the one book I would really like to adapt for radio.”
Some weeks later in a chance meeting on a corridor in Broadcasting House, Imison asked Sibley how he had learned that the BBC were in negotiations to obtain the rights. Sibley stated that he had not been aware, and had suggested the book because he was &quot;simply in love with [it]&quot;, having read it for the first time during an extended hospital stay a few years earlier. The BBC commissioned the adaptation and offered it to Sibley as the lead writer. The commissioners had determined that it should comprise 26 half-hour episodes (6 months&#x27; worth of weekly broadcasts), and that scriptwriting should be divided between two writers. Michael Bakewell was brought in as the second writer – a former producer and writer whose previous credits included a radio adaptation of Tolstoy’s &quot;War and Peace.&quot;

=== Writing ===

Sibley and Bakewell began the process of adapting the books by arranging the core storyline into 26 episode synopses, each with its own conventional narrative structure and ending on a natural ‘cliffhanger’. From these synopses, the full episode scripts would be developed. The source material presented a variety of challenges to the adaptation process. Sibley recalls pacing difficulties due to the book&#x27;s fluctuations between &quot;sections rich in description, others containing lengthy historical resumés, some having an abundance of dialogue, while others are almost entirely narrative.&quot; These challenges led to decisions to omit sections and characters that were deemed not to meaningfully advance the core plot. As such, the serial omits several sequences, most notably those in Book 1 in which the hobbits come to Crickhollow, enter the Old Forest, and encounter the Barrow-wights, Old Man Willow, and ultimately Tom Bombadil. On the latter, Sibley has stated he considers Bombadil to be a character Tolkien created independently of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and that it was preferable to &quot;excise one large episode than to dramatically reduce several others.&quot; On the decision to excise some minor characters who appeared for only a few lines of the book, Sibley stated he felt it preferable to remove the character altogether than the alternative, &quot;which would have been to fabricate dialogue for them.&quot;
The adaptation radically restructured the chronology of the chapters in Books 3-6, flattening out Tolkien&#x27;s interlacing by splicing the journey of Frodo and Sam with events in the West. This aligned them with the timeline of events provided by Tolkien in the Appendices, and kept more of the actors employed for more of the episodes.

The script attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original novel with many sections of dialogue lifted directly from the source material, such as the conversations between Frodo, Sam and Faramir in &quot;The Window on the West&quot;. The script also includes an arc where Wormtongue is waylaid by the Ringwraiths, as narrated in &quot;Unfinished Tales,&quot; a newly published volume at that time. In the final episode, &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot;, a Tolkien poem which does not appear in the novel, is used to flesh out the sequence at the Grey Havens. The author&#x27;s son and editor Christopher Tolkien reviewed and approved the final scripts for each episode. He recorded an audio cassette of correct pronunciations for Middle-earth words and names to assist the cast during recordings.

== Recording ==

Recording took place at BBC Broadcasting House over two months in 1980. One-and-a-half days was allotted for each of the 26 episodes to be rehearsed and recorded. Sibley recalls the recording sessions having &quot;quite a lot of laughter, quite a few tears, and a number of frazzled tempers&quot;. Gandalf-actor Michael Hordern recalled the sessions as &quot;a bit of a slog&quot;.

Elizabeth Parker of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop produced the sound effects. The composer Stephen Oliver, who had previously scored the RSC&#x27;s successful production of &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;, scored the music, with over 100 cues through the original 26-episode serial. The series was directed by Jane Morgan and Penny Leicester. Morgan stated she was anxious to avoid sound effects that were &quot;too literal&quot;, and wished to incorporate music in complex battle scenes.

== Episodes ==
::: *1.4–1.8 on Crickhollow, Fatty Bolger, the Old Forest, Barrow-wights and Tom Bombadil omitted

== Broadcasts and release ==

The serial was first broadcast from 8 March to 30 August 1981 on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays from 12 noon to 12:30pm; each episode was repeated on the following Wednesday from 10:30pm to 11:00pm. A soundtrack album featuring a re-recorded and in some cases expanded suite of Stephen Oliver&#x27;s music was released in 1981.

The 26-part series was edited into 13 hour-long episodes broadcast from 17 July to 9 October 1982, restoring some dialogue originally cut for timing. Following the success of Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy in the early 2000s, the BBC reissued its radio series in three sets (audiobooks) corresponding to the three original volumes (&quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;). This version omitted the original episode divisions, and included new opening and closing monologues for the first two sets, and an opening monologue only for the last, written by Sibley and performed by Ian Holm as Frodo Baggins. The soundtrack with Stephen Oliver&#x27;s music, digitally remastered, was included with &quot;The Return of the King&quot; set, with a demo of John Le Mesurier singing &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot; as a bonus track.

== Analysis ==

Sibley thought the casting of Ian Holm as Frodo &quot;simply inspired&quot;, his performance &quot;of unswerving determination, tempered always with humour and vulnerability.&quot; He felt that Hordern managed to &quot;become&quot; Gandalf, &quot;by intuition or some other theatrical magic ... by turn wise, stern and compassionate, a force for good, a constant light in an ever-darkening storm.&quot; As for John Le Mesurier&#x27;s Bilbo, the comic actor who had played Sergeant Wilson in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; gave the part &quot;a weary melancholy&quot;.

The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury sets out criteria for adapting a complex work like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. The adaptation, he writes, must not simply use characters and names to relabel some existing formula, or rewrite the story into a generic style; it must retain as much as possible of the original when translating the narrative into a drama; it must keep the presentation fresh, avoid repetition, and retain plausibility; and it must especially retain the coherent feeling of a Middle-earth under threat, along with the book&#x27;s momentum, coherence, moral conviction, and subtlety. Rosebury states that a radio production is &quot;fundamentally hampered&quot; by not being able to &quot;suggest the physical and cultural presence of Middle-earth&quot;, other than through the limited medium of sound effects. In his view, the few passages of narration in the production &quot;give tantalising glimpses of [Tolkien&#x27;s] breadth of vision which fades painfully as the studio-bound dialogues resume.&quot; He finds the dialogue well delivered by the actors, admiring especially Peter Woodthorpe&#x27;s &quot;fine Gollum&quot;, and the abridgement skilful though subtly flattening Tolkien&#x27;s text &quot;in the direction of an adventure story.&quot; The version&#x27;s strength, Rosebury writes, is in its rather faithful and almost complete rendering of the book&#x27;s events, though as in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s animated version and Peter Jackson&#x27;s live-action version, without Tom Bombadil.

The Tolkien scholar Christina Scull thought it a &quot;masterly adaptation&quot;, that stayed faithful to Tolkien&#x27;s story, presented most of the characters &quot;as he depicted them&quot;, and especially &quot;caught the spirit of the books&quot;. She found the handling of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields with alliterative verse &quot;a brilliant idea&quot;, and praised Gerard Murphy&#x27;s narration. Comparing the production with Jackson&#x27;s interpretation, she felt that her &quot;happiness with the BBC production made [her] even less happy with Jackson than I might have been without it&quot;, disliking the films&#x27; additional material, violence, and &quot;the weakening of almost all the characters&quot;. In her view, the BBC dramatisation presented &quot;the characters I [met] in the book&quot;, whereas the film version did not.

Peter Woodthorpe (Gollum/Sméagol) and Michael Graham Cox (Boromir) had previously voiced the same roles in Bakshi&#x27;s film in 1978. Ian Holm, who voiced Frodo Baggins in the radio serial, went on to play Bilbo Baggins in Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy in the early 2000s.

<doc id="516509" wikidata="Q468467" url="?curid=516509" title="Chung Ju-yung">
<text>Chung Ju-yung or Jung Joo-young (; 25 November 1915 – 21 March 2001), was a South Korean entrepreneur and the founder of Hyundai Groups, one of the largest chaebols in South Korea. Raised as the eldest son of a poor Korean farmer, Chung was an integral part of the rapid development of Korea&#x27;s economy, growing Hyundai Heavy Industries to be the largest shipbuilder in the world, as well as growing Hyundai Motor Group into the largest automobile manufacturer in Korea, and the third largest in the world. Chung was also a vital contributor to the development of South Korea&#x27;s infrastructure after the Korean War&#x27;s destruction of infrastructure, such as constructing the Gyeongbu Expressway in 1970, connecting the capital, Seoul, to the port city of Busan, in alliance with President Park Chung Hee.

Chung&#x27;s business ventures steered through the tumultuous times of Japanese colonial rule in Korea as well as the post-Korean War stresses on the economy.
Chung explained his success in his statement: &quot;Our people succeeded because they devoted their enterprising spirits. They used the forces of other minds. Conviction ... creates indomitable efforts. This is the key to (true) miracles ... Man&#x27;s potential is limitless.&quot;

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Chung Ju-yung was born in Tongchon, Korea, Empire of Japan (now Kangwon Province, North Korea). Born to an impoverished family. As a young boy, Chung hoped to become a school teacher, but his family could not afford to further his education. Chung was able to attend a local Confucian school run by his grandfather whenever his time was not taken up by tasks on the family farm.

Chung&#x27;s talent for business became apparent during his trips into town where he would sell wood.

====First escape attempt====
At the age of sixteen, Chung and a friend decided to travel to the city of Seishin (Chongjin, currently in North Korea) for work in hopes of escaping the harsh realities of farm life. After a 15-mile trek through the most dangerous parts of the Paechun valley, the pair reached the town of Kōgen (Kowon, currently in North Korea) where they took up jobs as construction workers. They worked long hours for low pay but Chung enjoyed that he could earn money independently. Chung and his friend continued the work for two months until Chung&#x27;s father learned of their whereabouts.

====Second escape attempt====
The journey that Chung and his friend had embarked on made him realize his passion for civil engineering and gave him a sense of accomplishment. Once he returned to his home village of Gasan-ri in Tsūsen-gun, he devised another escape plan: this time towards Keijō (formerly Hanseong, currently Seoul). With two companions, Chung left for Keijō in April 1933. The journey seemed destined for failure, especially since one of the boys was caught by a sibling early on. More misfortune came upon them when Chung and his friend were conned by a stranger who promised them jobs but instead took all of their money. The journey came to an end when Chung&#x27;s father found the two staying at Chung&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s house nearby.

====Third escape attempt====
Chung once again found himself in Asan, where he remained for a year helping his father work on the family farm. Once his duties to the family were complete, Chung decided it was time to make another attempt at getting out of poverty. He managed to get a train ticket for 70 won by selling one of his father&#x27;s cows. Once he arrived in Keijō, Chung enrolled himself in a local bookkeeping school hoping to start a career as an accountant. Things went smoothly for two months when his father managed to find him and after a mild argument, took him back to Gasan.

===Rice merchant===
In 1933, at age 18, Chung decided to make a fourth escape. He left during the night with a friend who was trying to escape a forced marriage. Once Chung reached the capital, he jumped at any job he could find. He worked first as a laborer at Jinsen Harbor (Incheon, currently in South Korea), a construction worker at Boseong Professional School and as a handyman for a starch syrup factory.

After working at the factory for nearly a year, Chung landed a job as a deliveryman at the Bokheung Rice Store in Keijō. Chung&#x27;s new job offered him room for advancement and he decided to stay on full time. He was allowed to manage the store&#x27;s accounting after six months on the job.

In 1937, the store owner became ill and decided to give the store to Chung. At 22, Chung became the owner and renamed the store to Kyungil Rice Store. The store grew and made profits until early 1939 when Japan, in its war efforts to secure rice supplies for the country and its military, imposed an rice-rationing system which forced Korean businesses out of trading rice.

===Creation of Hyundai===

====A-do Service Garage====
Chung returned to his village once his business failed and remained there until 1940, when he decided to try again in Keijō. After considering the restrictions imposed on Koreans in certain industries by the Japanese colonial government, Chung entered the automobile repair business. Using a service garage he purchased from a friend, Chung started the A-do Service Garage on a 3,000 won loan. Within three years, the number of employees grew from 20 to 70 and Chung was able to earn a good income. In 1943, the Japanese colonial government forced the garage to merge with a steel plant as part of the war effort. Although his businesses were shut down by the Japanese, Chung returned to Gasan with 50,000 yen in savings.

====Hyundai====
In 1946, after the liberation of Korea from Japanese control, Chung started Hyundai and Hyundai Civil Industries in anticipation of the post-war reconstruction and industrialization. Chung won government contracts and became responsible for building much of South Korea&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, including the Soyang Dam in 1967, the Gyeongbu Expressway in 1970, the world&#x27;s largest shipyard in Ulsan, and the Kori Nuclear Power Plant, among others. Chung also won contracts from the United States Forces Korea to build facilities for their personnel, leveraging his younger brother&#x27;s English proficiency and good relationship with U.S. Army engineers.

During the North Korean invasion of 1950, Chung abandoned his construction projects and fled with his younger brother to Busan for safety. His son, Chung Mong-joon was born there. Chung continued to build onto the company by gathering any kind of work he could get from the United Nations Command and the Korean Ministry of Transportation. Once Seoul was retaken by U.N. forces, Chung reestablished the company and continued to gather more work from the Americans.

Chung continued to grow and diversify the company into one of South Korea&#x27;s chaebols. With no experience in shipbuilding, he created the Ulsan shipyard. The first vessel was completed in three years (rather than the expected five) as Chung had the shipyard and vessel built simultaneously. He introduced the Hyundai Pony in 1975 and the Hyundai Excel in 1986, using European expertise.

===Later years===

From the 1980s until recently, the Hyundai Group was split into many satellite groups. In Seosan, he carried out a reclamation project, using a decommissioned oil tanker as a cofferdam. In 1998, he herded 1,001 cows through the Korean Demilitarized Zone to North Korea, which he claimed was a repayment 1,000 times over for a cow he took to afford his ticket when he left his father&#x27;s farm. Chung was the first civilian to cross the Korean DMZ since the division of Korea. He was the first to propose the Geumgangsan sightseeing excursions. He founded the Hyundai Heavy Steel Company, which developed a non-dock ship-making method.

Chung&#x27;s philanthropy distinguished him from the other businessmen of his generation. In 1977, he founded the Asan Foundation with a scope of activities comparable to those of the Ford or Rockefeller foundations. The foundation was organized into four areas of service: medical support, social welfare, research and development, and a scholarship fund. Through its efforts, the foundation established nine hospitals throughout South Korea, built Ulsan Medical College, and funded the Asan Life Sciences Research Institute. The foundation also initiated cooperative arrangements between industry and academic institutions by supporting such academic research as the Sinyoung Research Fund.

In 1982, Chung received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

=== Political activities ===
Chung is credited with successfully lobbying for South Korea to host the 1988 Summer Olympics. In 1992 the International Olympic Committee awarded Chung an IOC Medallion for his contributions to sports as a vehicle of international understanding.

Chung ran unsuccessfully as a Unification National Party presidential candidate for the 1992 South Korean presidential election. During this time, he was estimated to have a personal wealth of $4 billion, making him the richest man in Korea, though later estimates have placed him considerably lower.

Chung also worked to normalize relations between the two Koreas. In 1998, at the age of 82, he worked with the South Korean government to provide economic assistance to the North. President Kim Dae-jung wanted to provide a $100 million donation as a way to jump-start economic development in North Korea under his Sunshine Policy. However, Kim could not find a legal way to transfer the funds. He turned to Chung, who was already negotiating a large program with the North. Kim persuaded Chung to increase his investment by $100 million with money from secret loans provided by the government-controlled Korea Development Bank. The historic 2000 inter-Korean summit took place, with Chung traveling across the border in a motorcade of cars containing some 1001 &quot;unification cows&quot; as a gift to the North Korean people.

===Death===
Chung died in 2001 at the age of 85 of natural causes at his home in Seoul, and he was buried in accordance to Buddhist and Confucian customary rites. His wife, Byun Joong-seok, died on 17 August 2008, at the age of 88, due in part to long-term heart complications, and was buried in a family graveyard in Hanam, along with her husband and their son.

==Legacy==
As one of the most recognized and admired business men in Korean history, Chung&#x27;s identity still pervades modern Korean society and industry. Business-related events emphasizing creativity and innovation have been named after him. Much of the current success of Hyundai is widely attributed to Chung&#x27;s insight and resolution, ideals that the contemporary Hyundai leadership vow to keep.

<text>The Usipetes or Usipii (in Plutarch&#x27;s Greek, Ousipai, and possibly the same as the Ouispoi of Ptolemy) were an ancient Germanic people who entered the written record when they encountered Julius Caesar in 56/55 BC when they attempted to find a new settlement west of the Rhine, together with the Tencteri, who were both attempting to move away from the aggressions of the Suevi on the east side of the Rhine. After the Romans slaughtered a great number of both tribes, they resettled on the east bank with the help of the Sicambri.

By about 100 AD, in the time of the Roman author Tacitus, the Usipii and Tencterii had moved southwards along the eastern bank of the Rhine into a position between the Chatti and the river. During the reign of Gallienus around 260-268 AD, the Laterculus Veronensis, reports that the Romans lost control of the Usipii lands, and after this they no longer appear in historical records.

==Name==
While the Usipetes and their neighbours were referred to by the Romans as &quot;Germani&quot; rather than Gauls, their name is normally explained as Celtic, as is also the case for many of their neighbours, and the Romans did not strictly define the distinction between &quot;Germani&quot; and Gauls by language.

Following Rudolf Much, &quot;Usipetes&quot; has been traditionally interpreted as a Gaulish name meaning &#x27;good riders&#x27;. The suffix &quot;-ipetes&quot; (*&quot;epetes&quot;) was proposed to be a Celtic cognate of the Latin &quot;equites&quot;. Proponents of the theory pointed out to the fact that Caesar and others reported them to have strong cavalry. However, this etymology has been rejected as linguistically untenable in more recent scholarship.

Stefan Zimmer has proposed in 2006 to reconstruct the name as the Gaulish &quot;*Uχsi-pit-s&quot; (plural &quot;*Uχsi-pit-es&quot;), formed with the Indo-European stem &quot;*upsi-&quot; (&#x27;on-high&#x27; or &#x27;above&#x27;; cf. Gaulish &quot;uχe&quot; &#x27;high&#x27; apparently from *&quot;ouχsi&quot;) attached to &quot;*k̑u̯ei̯t-&quot; (&#x27;to appear&#x27;; with the P-Celtic sound shift &quot;kʷ-&quot; &gt; &quot;p-&quot;). He thus suggests to translate &quot;Usipetes&quot; (&quot;*Uχsipites&quot;) as &#x27;shining in the heights&#x27;, or &#x27;radiant&#x27;, which he explains as a typical boastful tribal name.

== History ==

=== Gallic wars ===

In his &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, Caesar describes how two tribes, the Tencteri and Usipetes, had been driven from their traditional lands by the Germanic Suebi, whose military dominance had led to constant warfare and neglect of agriculture. This original homeland of the two tribes is not clear but by the time of Caesar the Suebi had settled in a very large wooded area to the east of the Ubii, who at this time lived on the east bank of the Rhine, on the opposite bank from where Cologne is today. It has been argued that the Tencteri and Usipetes specifically may have come from the area of the Weser river to the east of the Sigambri, because it is near to where the two tribes appeared on the Rhine, and Caesar reports the Suevi in this area. It would also explain the apparently friendly relations of the Tencteri and Usipetes with the Sigambri, who might have been their traditional neighbours. (In later Roman times this area inhabited by Caesar&#x27;s Suebi was inhabited by the Chatti.)

In the winter 55 BC, having failed to find new lands elsewhere in Germania, they came to the Rhine, into the territory of the Menapii, a Belgic tribe who had land on both sides of the river, and had not yet submitted to Roman rule. Alarmed by the scale of the incursion, the Menapii had withdrawn from their territories east of the Rhine and successfully resisted the Germani bid to cross it for some time. The Germani feigned a retreat, allowing the Menapii to return to their territories east of the Rhine. Their cavalry then returned and made a surprise night attack. They crossed the river and seized Menapian boats, occupied Menapian villages and towns, and spent the rest of the winter living on Menapian provisions.

Concerning the exact location of this slaughter, there has long been some doubt. Caesar describes a of the Rhine and Maas rivers, but there is no such confluence. Archaeologist Nico Roymans has announced in 2015 that convincing evidence has been found that it was in fact in the confluence of Waal, a branch of the Rhine and not the Rhine itself, and the Maas/Meuse, near Kessel. On the other hand, the third century historian Cassius Dio described the place as being in the country of the Treveri near the Moselle, which had the same name as the Maas in Latin (&quot;Mosa&quot;) and does enter the Rhine in that region. This is however very far from the Menapii.

Caesar, fearing how the Gauls on the left bank might react, hurried to deal with this threat to his command of the region. He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the Condrusi and Eburones, who were both under the protection of the Treveri to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes.

The Tencteri and Usipetes sent ambassadors to Caesar as he advanced. While they boasted of their military strength, claiming that they could defeat anyone but the Suebi, they offered an alliance, requesting that Caesar assign them land. Caesar refused any alliance so long as the Tencteri and Usipetes remained in Gaul. He proposed settling them in the territory of the Ubii, another Germanic tribe who had sought his help against the aggression of the Suebi, there being no land available in Gaul. (The Ubii were at this time on the east bank of the Rhine, but would later be settled on the left bank, where their capital became Cologne.)

The ambassadors requested a truce of three days, during which time neither side would advance towards the other, and they took Caesar&#x27;s counter-proposal to their leaders for consideration. But Caesar would not accept this, believing the Germani were buying time for the return of their cavalry, who had crossed the Meuse to plunder the Ambivariti a few days previously. As Caesar continued to advance, further ambassadors requested a three-day truce for them to negotiate with the Ubii about his settlement proposal, but Caesar refused for the same reason. He offered a single day, during which he would advance no more than four miles, and ordered his officers to act defensively and not to provoke battle.

The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar&#x27;s Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, whereby horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar&#x27;s cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers. They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the Sicambri (or Sugambri).

Plutarch reports that back in Rome, Cato pronounced the opinion that they ought to deliver up Caesar to the Barbarians, thus purging away the violation of the truce in behalf of the city, and turning the curse therefor on the guilty man. Of those who had crossed the Rhine into Gaul four hundred thousand were cut to pieces, and the few who succeeded in making their way back were received by the Sugambri, a German nation. This action Caesar made a ground of complaint against the Sugambri, and besides, he coveted the fame of being the first man to cross the Rhine with an army.

=== Later mentions ===
The Usipetes, or &quot;Usipi&quot; as they were named by most authors after Caesar, remained in the same region although the details are not clear.
*In 16 BC, the Tencteri, Usipetes and Sicambri once again crossed the Rhine and attacked Gaul. Marcus Lollius was defeated in the &quot;clades Lolliana&quot; and the Germanic tribes took the standard of the Legio V Macedonica.
*In 12 BC and 11 BC at the time of Drusus, the Usipi are described as living between Nijmegen and the Sugambri, and neighboring the Tubantes, which means they were in the region of the present day Dutch-German border, north of the Rhine and Lippe rivers. 
*In 14 AD the Usipetes still lived north of the Lippe and joined the Bructeri and Tubantes when fighting Germanicus. 
*In 17 AD, Strabo describes the Usipi as being among the defeated tribes displayed in the triumphal procession of Germanicus.

Tacitus also describes in his &quot;Annales&quot; how in 58 AD the Ampsivarii demanded to be allowed to use the reserved lands on Roman border at the Rhine which had recently belonged to the Usipii, but it is not clearly explained where or why the Usipii had moved. What is mentioned is that when the Ampsivarii retreated from the Romans, and apparently also away from the lands of the Bructeri and Tencteri (who had already stood down), they moved towards the lands of the Tubantes and Usipii. So the Usipi seem to have settled for some time after Caesar on the north of the Rhine, and then later moved further north, away from the Roman frontier, to become neighbours of the Tubantes.

Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Agricola&quot; (chapter 28), recounts how a cohort drafted into the Roman army mutinied whilst on campaign in northern Britain (presumably on the west coast) with his father-in-law, the general Gnaeus Julius Agricola (probably in AD 82, although the chronology is disputed). They killed the centurion and regular Roman soldiers based with them for training purposes, then stole three ships and sailed round the northern end of Britain, their hardships including being driven to cannibalism by shortage of food. They finally made landfall in the territory of the Suebi, where some were captured by that tribe. Others were caught by the Frisii and a few survivors were sold into slavery to tell their tale.

Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot; describes them as now living in 98 AD between the Chatti and the Rhine, near the Tencteri. This apparently indicates a significant movement south from the area near the Tubantes.

Later, the difficult to interpret description given in Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; describes the &quot;Ouispoi&quot; (Uispi or Vispi) living south of the Tencteri, between the Rhine and the Abnoba mountains, but north of the Agri Decumates. If these are the Usipi, then they had moved considerably. (The same passage can also be interpreted as describing the Tencteri as having moved south.)

Gallienus reigned solo from 260 to 268 AD, and during this period the document known as the Laterculus Veronensis, which was made about 314 AD, notes that the Romans lost five &quot;civitates&quot; (cities, and the countries around them) on the other side of the Rhine. The three which are legible are those of the Usipii, Tubantes, and Chattuari. While the Chattuari and Tubantes continued to appear in records as Frankish peoples the Usipii and Tencteri are no longer mentioned.

In the Peutinger map, the area across from Cologne and Bonn is shown as inhabited by the &quot;Burcturi&quot; (Bructeri), who may have included a mixture of several of the original Germanic tribes from over the Rhine, including the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Bructeri had apparently therefore also moved south. To their north was called Francia and to their south on the Rhine was called Suevia.

<text>George Edmund Badger (April 17, 1795May 11, 1866) was an American politician who served as a Whig U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina.

==Early life==
Badger was born on April 17, 1795, in New Bern, North Carolina. He attended Yale College (where he was a member of Brothers in Unity) and received a partial college education that was terminated due to lack of funds; afterwards, he studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814.

==Career==
Badger practiced law in North Carolina, was active in state politics, and served as a state superior court judge. A supporter of Andrew Jackson from the 1820s, he separated with him in the mid-1830s, became a leader of the Whig party and helped carry the Whigs to victory in the 1840 Presidential election.

Upon taking office, President William Henry Harrison appointed Badger as his Secretary of the Navy, and he continued in that post for a few months (until September 1841, when he resigned to resume private practice) when John Tyler succeeded to the Presidency upon Harrison&#x27;s death (April 1841). Badger&#x27;s brief term as Secretary was marked by efforts to strengthen the Navy in the face of tension with Great Britain, the establishment of the U.S. Home Squadron, and growing interest in steamships.

Badger resigned in September 1841, during a general cabinet shakeup. The resignation of several cabinet members, including Badger, resulted from Tyler&#x27;s vetoing of two bills to create a new national bank, which the Whig party, led by Henry Clay, supported. Badger was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1846 to fill the unexpired term of William Henry Haywood, Jr. and remained in office until 1855, after choosing not to run for re-election. While in the Senate, he supported the Compromise of 1850.

He was nominated by President Millard Fillmore as an Associate justice of the Supreme Court on January 3, 1853, to succeed John McKinley. On February 11, 1853, the Senate voted to table a nomination, and the president withdrew it three days later.

Badger&#x27;s wealth grew throughout his political career; by 1860, he was worth an estimated $145,000 (~$ in ). He was a slave owner, enslaving twenty people. He was a Unionist during the secession crisis but thereafter supported the Confederate war effort.

==Death and legacy==
Badger died in Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1866.

Two Navy ships have been named in honor of Senator Badger: USS &quot;George E. Badger&quot; (DD-196), and USS &quot;Badger&quot; (FF-1071). A Liberty ship, the &quot;SS George E. Badger&quot;, also was named in his honor. Badger was a cousin of naval officers Oscar C. Badger, Charles J. Badger and Oscar C. Badger II.

<text>The Museum of Flight is a private non-profit air and space museum in the Seattle metropolitan area. It is located at the southern end of King County International Airport (Boeing Field) in the city of Tukwila, immediately south of Seattle. It was established in 1965 and is fully accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. As the largest private air and space museum in the world, it also hosts large K–12 educational programs.

The museum attracts over 500,000 visitors every year, and also serves more than 140,000 students annually through its onsite programs: a Challenger Learning Center, an Aviation Learning Center, and a summer camp (ACE), as well as outreach programs that travel throughout Washington and Oregon.

==History==
The Museum of Flight can trace its roots back to the Pacific Northwest Aviation Historical Foundation, which was founded in 1965 to recover and restore a 1929 Boeing 80A-1, which had been discovered in Anchorage, Alaska. The restoration took place over a 16-year period, and after completion, was put on display as a centerpiece for the museum. In 1968, the name &quot;Museum of Flight&quot; first appeared in use in a facility, rented at the Seattle Center. Planning began at this time for a more permanent structure, and preliminary concepts were drafted.

In 1975, The &quot;William E. Boeing Red Barn&quot; was acquired for one dollar from the Port of Seattle, which had taken possession of it after Boeing abandoned it during World War II. The 1909 all-wooden Red Barn, the original home of the company, was barged two miles (3 km) up the Duwamish River to its current location at the southwestern end of Boeing Field. Fundraising was slow in the late 1970s, and after restoration, the two-story Red Barn was opened to the public in 1983.

That year a funding campaign was launched, so capital could be raised for construction of the &quot;T.A. Wilson Great Gallery&quot;. In 1987, Vice President George Bush, joined by four Mercury astronauts, cut the ribbon to open the facility on July 10, with an expansive volume of . The gallery&#x27;s structure is built in a space frame lattice structure and holds more than 20 hanging aircraft, including a Douglas DC-3 weighing more than nine tons.

The museum&#x27;s education programs grew significantly with the building of a Challenger Learning Center in 1992. This interactive exhibit allows students to experience a Space Shuttle mission. It includes a mock-up NASA mission control, and experiments from all areas of space research.

Completed in 1994, the 132-seat Wings Cafe and the 250-seat Skyline multipurpose banquet and meeting room increased the museum&#x27;s footprint to . At the same time, one of the museum&#x27;s most widely recognized and popular artifacts, the Lockheed M-21, a modified Lockheed A-12 Oxcart designed to carry the Lockheed D-21 reconnaissance drones, was placed on the floor at the center of the Great Gallery, after being fully restored.

The first jet-powered Air Force One (1959–1962, SAM 970), a Boeing VC-137B, was flown to Boeing Field in 1996; it arrived in June and was opened to visitors in October. Retired from active service earlier that year, it is on loan from the Air Force Museum. Originally parked on the east side of the museum, it was driven across East Marginal Way and now resides in the museum&#x27;s Airpark, where it is open to public walkthroughs.

In 1997, the museum opened the first full scale, interactive Air Traffic Control tower exhibit. The tower overlooks the Boeing Field runways, home to one of the thirty busiest general aviation airports in the country. The exhibit offers a glimpse into what it is like to be an air traffic controller.

The next major expansion was opened in 2004, with the addition of the &quot;J. Elroy McCaw Personal Courage Wing&quot;, named after J. Elroy McCaw, an area businessman, entrepreneur and World War II veteran. North of the Red Barn, the wing has of exhibit space on two floors, with more than 25 World War I and World War II aircraft. It also has large collection of model aircraft, including every plane from both wars. Many of these aircraft were from the collection of the Champlin Fighter Museum, formerly in Mesa, Arizona, which closed in 2003. The wing opened on June 6, the sixtieth anniversary of D-Day.

In June 2010, the museum broke ground on a $12 million new building to house a Space Shuttle it hoped to receive from NASA, named the Charles Simonyi Space Gallery. The new building includes multisensory exhibits that emphasize stories from the visionaries, designers, pilots, and crews of the Space Shuttle and other space related missions. The gallery opened to the public in November 2012.

Though the museum did not receive one of the four remaining Shuttles, it did receive the Full Fuselage Trainer (FFT), a Shuttle mockup that was used to train all Space Shuttle astronauts. Because it is a trainer and not an actual Shuttle, small group (no more than six persons, minimum age 10, maximum height ) guided tours of the interior are available, for an extra charge. The FFT began arriving in various pieces beginning in 2012. The cockpit and two sections of the payload bay arrived via NASA&#x27;s Super Guppy.

During the 50th anniversary celebrations for Apollo 11 in 2019, the Museum of Flight hosted a traveling Smithsonian exhibit with the Apollo Command module &quot;Columbia&quot;, which was used during the first Moon landing.

==Aircraft on display==
The Museum of Flight has more than 150 aircraft in its collection, including:

; Boeing 747: the first flight-worthy B747, &quot;City of Everett&quot;. Its registration number is N7470, and it was named after the city of Everett, Washington. Its first flight was on February 9, 1969, and was retired in 1990. (Open for walkthrough)
; Boeing VC-137B SAM 970: the first presidential jet, which served in the presidential fleet from 1959 to 1996 (open for walkthrough)

==Exhibits and facilities==
On its grounds is the Personal Courage Wing (PCW) with 28 World War I and World War II aircraft from several countries including Germany, Russia, and Japan.

There is also the &quot;Red Barn&quot;, a registered historic site also known as Building No. 105. Built in 1909, the building was used during the early 1900s as Boeing&#x27;s original manufacturing plant. Through photographs, film, oral histories, and restoration of work stations the exhibits in the Red Barn illustrate how wooden aircraft structure with fabric overlays were manufactured in the early years of aviation and provides a history of aviation development through 1958.

In June 2007 the museum opened a new space exhibit: &quot;Space: Exploring the New Frontier&quot;, which traces the evolution of space flight from the times of Robert Goddard to the present and into future commercial spaceflight.

===Restoration facility===
The museum maintains a restoration facility at Paine Field in Everett with about 39 ongoing projects including a de Havilland Comet 4 jet airliner, a Jetstar, and the Boeing 2707 mockup, among many.

===Museum of Flight Library and Archives===
The Harl V. Brackin Library at the Museum of Flight was founded in 1985. As of 2011, it contains 66,000 books and subscribes to 100 periodicals; specializing in aerospace and aviation, it has an online catalog.

The Museum of Flight Archives is accessible to the public via the Kenneth H. Dahlberg Aviation Research Center. It includes millions of photographs and thousands of linear feet of manuscript materials. Highlights of the collections include the Gordon S. Williams photographic collection, the Peter M. Bowers Photographic Collection, the David D. Hatfield Aviation History Collection, the Norm Taylor Photographic Collection, the Elrey B. Jeppesen Aviation History and Navigation Collection, the American Fighter Aces Association Archives, the Lear Corporation Archives, and the Wright Airplane Company Collection.

In December 2017, the Archives launched a digital repository. The site features digitized materials from archival, library, and artifact collections. In April 2019 the Archives began to make archival collections available and searchable online.

===Other facilities===
In September 2013, Raisbeck Aviation High School (formerly Aviation High School) opened in a new facility directly north of the museum&#x27;s Airpark. The school is operated by Highline Public Schools as a STEM school with a focus on aviation. The school operates in partnership with the museum (which owns the land), Boeing, and other members of the local aviation industry. The facility will also be used for the museum&#x27;s summer education programs when school is not in session.

Opened to the public in June 2016, the Aviation Pavilion spans the gap between the high school and the Space Gallery. The cover allows aircraft which were seasonally brought out, such as the B-17 Flying Fortress and B-29 Superfortress, to be put permanently on display. Constructed as part of the comprehensive &quot;Inspiration Begins Here!&quot; campaign, the pavilion contains 18 of the museum&#x27;s most iconic aircraft. The roof doubles the museum&#x27;s exhibit space, and was built with help from Sellen Construction and Seneca Real Estate Development.

In late May 2019, the museum opened the featuring the fully restored B-52G Stratofortess &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (59-2584) as the culmination of Project Welcome Home. Just west of the Aviation Pavilion, the park is free to the public.

He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Williamston from 1831 to 1845, and from 1847 to 1854. In 1832, he married Martha Elizabeth Andrews; they had 10 children, 2 of which died in infancy. Biggs owned &quot;several slaves&quot; as a result of his marriage.

He was a delegate to the North Carolina constitutional convention in 1835. He was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons (now the North Carolina House of Representatives) from 1840 to 1842. He was a member of the North Carolina Senate from 1844 to 1845.

==Congressional service==

Biggs was elected as a Democrat from North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 29th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1845, to March 3, 1847. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1846. He was a member of a commission to codify North Carolina laws in 1851 along with Bartholomew F. Moore and Romulous M. Saunders. He was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1855, until May 5, 1858, when he resigned to accept a federal judicial post.

<doc id="516539" wikidata="Q1341723" url="?curid=516539" title="Thomas L. Clingman">
<text>Thomas Lanier Clingman (July 27, 1812November 3, 1897), known as the &quot;Prince of Politicians,&quot; was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 1843 to 1845 and from 1847 to 1858, and U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1858 and 1861. During the Civil War, he refused to resign his Senate seat and was one of the many southern senators subsequently expelled from the Senate in absentia. He then served as a general in the Confederate States Army.

== Early life ==
Clingman, was born in Huntsville, a small community in present-day Yadkin County, North Carolina. His parents were Jacob and Jane Poindexter Clingman and he was named for Dr. Thomas Lanier, his half uncle. He was educated by private tutors and in the public schools in Iredell County, NC. Clingman graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1832, where he was a member of the Dialectic Senate of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1834 and began practice in Huntsville.

== Political career ==

Clingman was elected to the North Carolina State House of Commons in 1835. In 1836 he moved to Asheville, North Carolina. He was a member of the North Carolina State Senate in 1840. In 1843 Clingman ran as a Whig and was elected to the 28th United States Congress, however he was defeated in his reelection bid in 1845. In 1845 he fought a duel with a fellow congressman William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama. In Yancey&#x27;s maiden speech on the House floor, he had impugned his opponent&#x27;s integrity. Both duelists had missed. In 1847 he regained the seat and won reelection in 1849, 1851, 1853, 1855 and 1857. On May 7, 1858, he resigned after becoming a United States senator as a Democrat the previous day, replacing the resigning Asa Biggs. He was reelected but was expelled from the Senate for support of the Confederacy.

== Civil War ==
When he first entered the War, Clingman was the commander of the 25th North Carolina Infantry and took part in the Peninsula Campaign. He later commanded a brigade of infantry. Clingman&#x27;s Brigade consisted of the 8th, 31st, 51st and 61st North Carolina Infantry. Clingman&#x27;s Brigade fought at Goldsborough, Battery Wagner, Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, Globe Tavern, Fort Fisher, and Bentonville.

== Post-war career ==
After the Civil War, Clingman explored and measured mountains in western North Carolina and Tennessee. Kuwohi, Tennessee&#x27;s highest mountain, also partly in North Carolina, was renamed Clingman&#x27;s Dome in his honor in 1859 as Kuwohi was one of the mountains he had accurately measured, being said to be the first person to do so. The mountain&#x27;s name was changed back to Kuwohi in 2024. He died in Morganton, North Carolina, and was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, North Carolina.

<text>, often known as Alex, is a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. Born in Brazil, he became a Japanese citizen and made 82 appearances for the Japan national team.

==Club career==
Santos was born in Maringá in Paraná and moved to Japan in 1994 at the age of sixteen. He enrolled in Meitoku Gijuku High School in Kōchi and played football for the school club. After graduating from the school, he joined the J1 League team Shimizu S-Pulse in 1997. In 1999, the club won the second place and he received the J.League Player of the Year. In Asia, the club won the champions 1999–2000 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and third place 2000–01 Asian Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

In August 2002, Santos agreed to join English Premier League club Charlton Athletic. But he was denied a work permit by the Home Office because he had not made the minimum number of national team appearances required for players from outside the European Union and returned to Shimizu for the remainder of the season. In January 2004, he left Shimizu to join the Urawa Reds. They would come in second place at J1 League for two consecutive seasons in (2004, 2005). The club won the 2006 J1 League title.

In January 2007, Santos was loaned out to Red Bull Salzburg. He went back to Urawa in January 2008. He received a serious injury in a test match and had only one appearance in this season. In July 2009, he agreed to move to Nagoya Grampus. He made 55 appearances for the club, before joining J2 League side Tochigi SC for the 2013 season. He made 25 appearances there, scoring twice. In January 2014, he joined fellow J2 League team FC Gifu.

==International career==
In 2001, Santos obtained Japanese citizenship. He made his first appearance for Japan national team on 21 March 2002, against Ukraine, and he was part of Philippe Troussier&#x27;s selection for the 2002 World Cup. He was the second non-Japan-born person to play for Japan in the World Cup finals. Wagner Lopes was the first who played in the 1998 World Cup. Santos became the fifth naturalized Japanese citizen to play for Japan following Daishiro Yoshimura, George Yonashiro, Ruy Ramos, and Lopes.

After Zico took over as the national team manager, Santos was used on the left side of the Japanese lineup, as a full-back in a 4-4-2 formation or a midfielder in a 3-5-2 formation. He played in all 6 matches of the 2004 Asian Cup; Japan won. In May 2006 he was selected in the Japan squad for the 2006 World Cup, providing an assist for Keiji Tamada in a group stage match against his former country Brazil. Until 1982, he played 82 games and scored 7 goals for Japan.

==Others==

In 2020, Alex founded the Aruko Sports Brasil, a team that currently competes in the Campeonato Paranaense.

<text>Altera Corporation is a manufacturer of programmable logic devices (PLDs) headquartered in San Jose, California. It was founded in 1983 and acquired by Intel in 2015 before becoming independent once again in 2024 as a company focused on development of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology and system on a chip FPGAs.

The company was founded in 1983 by semiconductor veterans Rodney Smith, Robert Hartmann, James Sansbury, and Paul Newhagen with $500,000 in seed money. The name of the company was a play on &quot;alterable&quot;, the type of chips the company created. In 1988, Altera became a public company via an initial public offering (IPO).

On December 28, 2015, the company was acquired by Intel and became a newly formed business unit called Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). In October 2023, Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of 2024, while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years. In February 2024, Intel announced that the newly independent company would reestablish the Altera name and branding.

==Products==
===FPGAs===


The main product lines from Altera are the Agilex FPGA product lines, and their predecessors: the high-end Stratix series, mid-range Arria series, and lower-cost Cyclone series; as well as the MAX series non-volatile FPGAs.

=== Semiconductor intellectual property cores ===
Altera and its partners offer an array of semiconductor intellectual property cores that serve as building blocks that design engineers can drop into their system designs to perform specific functions. IP cores eliminate some of the time-consuming tasks of creating every block in a design from scratch. In 2000, Altera acquired Designpro and Northwest Logic, providers of IP cores, in order to expand its design capabilities and move towards delivery of complete system-on-chip solutions.

=== System on a chip FPGAs ===
Beginning in December 2012, the company announced the shipment of its first system on a chip FPGA devices using a fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) 28 nm chip manufacturing process. These are the Cyclone V SoC devices, which have a dual-core ARM architecture Cortex-A9 processor system with FPGA logic on a single chip. These devices integrated FPGAs with full hard processor systems based around ARM architecture onto a single device. As of 2024, the majority of Altera&#x27;s FPGA devices are available as an SoC variant with an ARM hard processor system integrated with the FPGA as a single system on a chip.

These SoCs are targeted for use in wireless communications, industrial, video surveillance, automotive and medical equipment markets. With these SoCs devices, users were able to create custom field-programmable SoC variants for power, board space, performance and cost optimization.

Cyclone V SoC, Arria V SoC and Arria 10 SoC product families are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex-A9 dual-core processor system.

Stratix 10 SoC and Agilex 7 SoC product families are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex-A53 quad-core processor system.

The Agilex 5 SoC product family are system on a chip FPGAs based upon a hard ARM Cortex-A76/A55 quad-core processor system.

===Soft Processor cores===
Altera offers the Nios V embedded soft processor cores based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture. Previously Altera had offered their own proprietary Nios II embedded soft processor, the Freescale ColdFire v1 core, and the ARM Cortex-M1 processor.

===Design software===
All of Altera&#x27;s devices are supported by a common design environment, the Quartus Prime design software, which is a multi-platform development environment that includes various tools needed to design FPGAs, SoC FPGAs, and CPLDs.

In May 2013, Altera made available SDK for OpenCL, enabling software programmers to access the high-performance capabilities of programmable logic devices.

Altera also support high-level synthesis using SYCL extensions to ANSI C/C++.

==Intel Partnership, Acquisition and Ownership==
===PLD Technology Licensing Partnership===
In 1984, the company formed a partnership with Intel, licensing its programmable logic technology to Intel. In 1994, Altera acquired the PLD business of Intel for $50 million.

===Intel 14-nm technology===
In February 2013, Altera announced an agreement to use Intel&#x27;s foundry services to produce its 14-nm node for the future manufacturing of its FPGAs, based on Intel&#x27;s 14-nm tri-gate transistor technology, in place of Altera&#x27;s ongoing agreement with TSMC. The Stratix 10 product family was the first such product line.

=== Acquisition and Ownership by Intel ===
In December 2015, Intel acquired Altera for $16.7 billion in cash. Altera became Intel&#x27;s newly formed business unit called the Programmable Solutions Group (PSG). 

In October 2023, Intel announced it would be spinning off PSG into a separate company at the start of 2024, while maintaining majority ownership and intending to seek an IPO within three years. In February 2024, Intel announced that the newly independent company would reestablish the Altera name and branding.

==Restatement of financial results==
On June 21, 2006, after an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company restated its financial results from 1996 to 2005 to correct accounting errors related to options backdating. The chief financial officer of the company resigned. Altera filed a petition to overturn related regulations but was, under Intel, denied in 2020.

<text>Joseph Carter Abbott (July 15, 1825October 8, 1881) was a Union Army colonel during the American Civil War who was awarded the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers and a Republican United States senator from the state of North Carolina between 1868 and 1871. During his career in private life he was a lawyer, newspaper editor and businessman. He also served as collector of the port of Wilmington, inspector of posts along the eastern line of the southern coast during the Rutherford B. Hayes Administration, and special agent of the United States Treasury Department.

==Early life==
Abbott was born in Concord, New Hampshire, to farmer Aaron Carter Abbott and Nancy Badger, and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1846, having studied there and under private auspices. He studied law at Concord, and was admitted to the bar in 1852. From 1852 to 1857, Abbott was the owner and editor of the &quot;Daily American&quot; newspaper, in Manchester, New Hampshire. His success with it led to his being given the position of editor of the &quot;Boston Atlas and Bee,&quot; which he held from 1859 through 1861.

He served as Adjutant General of New Hampshire from 1855 to 1861, reorganizing the state militia during that time. He was also a member of the commission to adjust the boundary between New Hampshire and Canada. He early joined the Know Nothing Party, and during all these years was a frequent contributor to the magazines, being particularly interested in historical matters.

==Civil War==
In December 1861, Abbott became the lieutenant colonel of the 7th New Hampshire Volunteer Infantry Regiment and participated in the battles of Port Royal Sound, St. John&#x27;s Bluff, Fort Pulaski and Fort Wagner. In November 1863, he became colonel of the regiment and led it at the Battle of Olustee and during the subsequent Bermuda Hundred Campaign in Virginia.

During the siege of Petersburg, he commanded the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, X Corps at Chaffin&#x27;s Farm and the subsequent actions along the Darbytown and New Market Roads. The Army of the James was then reorganized and his command became the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, XXIV Corps which was attached to the Fort Fisher Expeditionary Corps under Brig. Gen. Alfred H. Terry and participated in the second battle of Fort Fisher and the capture of Wilmington. Although Abbott was not appointed as a full, substantive rank general, on January 25, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Abbott for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from January 15, 1865 for gallant services in the capture of Fort Fisher and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14, 1865. During the final stages of the war, he was stationed in Wilmington, North Carolina.

==Postbellum==
Following the war, Abbott remained in North Carolina. He was active in state politics, serving as a delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1868. During this time, his political strength came primarily through the black population. He believed in their capacity and assisted in organization and politically counseling them in ways which brought him blunt warnings from the white population. He was elected to the United States Senate that same year, representing North Carolina in that body for the first time since July 1861, when the state&#x27;s two senators were expelled following the North Carolina&#x27;s secession from the Union. He served as a senator from July 14, 1868 to March 4, 1871.

He also served as a member of the Republican National Committee from North Carolina from 1870 through 1872. During this period, he was also found to be in the pay of a &quot;ring&quot; whose major interests seemed substantially similar to Abbott&#x27;s own political positions. During his tenure in the Senate, he spoke in orthodox terms on matters of suffrage, and was helpful in handling the details of army administration. He devoted a good deal of time to improve the harbor of Wilmington, and hoped that the railroads of the Carolinas would be consolidated and made part of a southern transcontinental system. However, for all his efforts, his single greatest achievement was the imposition of a duty on peanuts. He was not nominated for a second term to the Senate.

Upon leaving the Senate, he conducted a lumber manufacturing business and served as editor of the &quot;Wilmington Post.&quot; He also received federal offices from both Presidents Rutherford Hayes and Ulysses S. Grant, including serving as collector of the port of Wilmington, inspector of posts along the eastern line of the southern coast during the Rutherford B. Hayes Administration, and special agent of the United States Treasury Department. From August 1869, he served as editor of the &quot;Wilmington Post&quot;, a Republican organ of good quality for the era. However, he never again achieved any real status as a party leader. He established the town of Abbottsburg, North Carolina.

He was originally buried in the National Cemetery in Wilmington, North Carolina. He was reinterred in 1887 at Valley Cemetery in Manchester, New Hampshire. Despite three marriages, he died childless. His political legacy is not much better, with the &quot;Dictionary of American Biography&quot; writing that &quot;The historians of the state even now mention him only to condemn him.&quot;

<text>Matthew Whitaker Ransom (October 8, 1826October 8, 1904) was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1872 and 1895.

==Early life ==
Matt Ransom was born in Warren County, North Carolina, to Robert and Priscilla Whitaker Ransom. He was the elder brother of General Robert Ransom, a cousin to fellow Confederate officer Wharton J. Green, who served as a U. S. Congressman after the Civil War, and a cousin to physician and aviation pioneer William Whitney Christmas. Matt Ransom graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1847, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society.

==Career==
After serving as North Carolina Attorney General and as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, Matt W. Ransom was chosen as one of the three commissioners from North Carolina to the Confederate government at Montgomery, Alabama, in 1861.

===American Civil War===
Ransom was commissioned lieutenant colonel of the 1st North Carolina Infantry Regiment and later colonel of the 35th North Carolina Infantry. This regiment was part of his brother Robert&#x27;s brigade, which Matt later commanded. Ransom was promoted to brigadier general on June 13, 1863. Ransom saw action in the battles of Seven Pines, the Seven Days Battles, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Plymouth, Weldon, Suffolk and the siege of Petersburg. He was wounded three times during the Civil War and finally surrendered at Appomattox.

===Later life===
After the war, Ransom moved to Weldon, North Carolina, in 1866 where he was a planter and lawyer. In 1872, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy in the term commencing March 4, 1871. Ransom was re-elected in 1876, 1883, and 1889 and served from January 30, 1872, to March 4, 1895. Ransom served briefly as President Pro tempore of the Senate during the 53rd Congress. He was later appointed United States Minister to Mexico and served from 1895 to 1897.

Following his term as ambassador, Ransom retired to Verona, his estate, and engaged in agricultural pursuits.

==Personal life==
On January 19, 1853, Ransom married Martha Anne &quot;Pattie&quot; Exum of Northampton County, North Carolina. The couple resided at Verona, the Exum family&#x27;s plantation on the banks of the Roanoke River. Matt and Martha produced at least eight children together: Matt W., Jr., Joseph E., George E., Esther, Patrick Exum, and Robert. A slaveholder, Matt W. Ransom also sired two children with Emma Outland, one of the women of African descent Ransom enslaved; Matt W. Ransom&#x27;s children with the enslaved Emma Outland were Douglas Ransom (born 1859) and Alice Ransom (wife of Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Rawles, one of North Carolina&#x27;s first African-American state legislators).

He died near Garysburg, North Carolina, on his 78th birthday, October 8, 1904. Ransom was buried on his estate, near Jackson, North Carolina. Verona was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

<doc id="516559" wikidata="Q1899130" url="?curid=516559" title="Marion Butler">
<text>Marion Butler (May 20, 1863June 3, 1938) was an American politician, farmer, and lawyer. He represented North Carolina in the United States Senate for one term, serving between 1895 and 1901. At the time, he was a leader of the North Carolina Populist Party, and also affiliated with the Democratic Party and the Republican Party at different points in his career. He was the older brother of George Edwin Butler.

Born in Sampson County, North Carolina, Butler took over his family&#x27;s farm after graduating from the University of North Carolina. He became a leader of the Farmers&#x27; Alliance and won election to the North Carolina Senate as a member of the Democratic Party. During the 1892 election, he led a group of North Carolina Democrats opposed to Grover Cleveland into the Populist Party. As a leader of the Populists, Butler advocated &quot;Fusion&quot; with the Republican Party, and the Populists and Republicans together won control of the state legislature in the 1894 elections. The new legislature elected Butler to the United States Senate.

In the Senate, Butler advocated for Populist reforms like the institution of bimetallism and the nationalization of railroads. In the 1896 presidential election, Butler helped orchestrate a compromise with the national Democratic Party whereby both parties nominated William Jennings Bryan. Butler stood for re-election in 1900, but Democrats had regained control of the state legislature and he was defeated. After his defeat, Butler practiced law in Washington, D.C. He died in 1938 in Takoma Park, Maryland, a nearby suburb.

==Early life==

Butler was born in 1863 in rural Sampson County, North Carolina during the American Civil War. His parents were yeomen farmers. It is unknown if he attended any of the new public schools established after the war, but he was a graduate of the University of North Carolina. There he was a member of the Dialectic Society. His planned to practice law, but his father&#x27;s death required Butler to take responsibility for managing the family farm, rather than attending law school.

==Farmers&#x27; Alliance and Populism==

When the Farmers&#x27; Alliance movement spread from the Southwest into North Carolina in the late 1880s, Butler immediately joined the organization. It provided him a ladder of political opportunity that he climbed with impressive speed. As the son of yeoman farmers, Butler grew up in a strong agrarian tradition. Possessing the formal education and experiences from his years at the University of North Carolina, Butler stood out from his fellow farmers. By the age of 25, he was elected President of the local Farmers&#x27; Alliance and in 1893 was elected President of the National Farmer&#x27;s Alliance.

Still a Democrat at this time, Butler was elected to the North Carolina Senate as an &quot;Alliance Democrat&quot; in 1890. In 1891, at age 28, he was elected President of the State Farmers&#x27; Alliance. Due to a general distaste for Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland, and the North Carolina Democratic Party&#x27;s ruling that no voter could vote on a &quot;split ticket&quot;, Butler led a mass exodus of Alliance members and followers from the Democratic party which had ruled the state since Reconstruction, to the Populist, or &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot; in 1892.

During his tenure with the Populists, Butler was an advocate of &quot;Fusion&quot;, meaning outright cooperation with the North Carolina Republican Party as a means to achieve some of the more important goals of his party. While some Populists disliked what they saw as a compromise made on some of their core beliefs, Butler saw short-term success. Together the Populists and Republicans polled a larger vote than the Democrats in the election of 1892; their Fusion candidates swept both houses of the legislature in the Election of 1894.

==Senate career==

In 1894, Butler was elected as United States Senator from North Carolina, serving alongside Senator Jeter C. Pritchard. As a United States Senator, Butler continued to advocate for workable reforms from the Populist Party Platform, including the regulation or outright ownership by the United States Government of railroads and telegraphs, as well as for a silver-based currency system.

Butler obtained national prominence in the 1896 United States presidential election when he orchestrated a compromise between Democrats and Populists. Populists endorsed Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan on a ticket with Populist vice-presidential nominee Thomas E. Watson. This was another example of &quot;fusion&quot; under Butler. Ironically, this national Populist-Democrat cooperation coincided with the Populist-Republican cooperation in North Carolina. After Bryan&#x27;s loss, Butler continued to work for reform on the national stage which would benefit farmers, but this work would soon be cut short by the &quot;white supremacy&quot; campaigns of the Democratic Party in North Carolina. Butler lost his bid for re-election in 1900, however he would remain the national chairman of the People&#x27;s Party until 1904 when he would officially become a Republican. Butler joined the Progressive Republican Faction of the National Republican Party alongside notable individuals such as Theodore Roosevelt.

==Post–Senate career==
During his time as Senator, Butler received his law degree from the University of North Carolina, and after his electoral defeat in 1904, practiced law in Washington, D.C.

He married Florence Faison of Sampson County on August 31, 1893, and they had five children: Pocahontas, Marion, Edward F., Florence F., and Wiley. The former Senator died in Takoma Park, Maryland in 1938, and was buried at Saint Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Clinton, North Carolina. A portrait of Marion Butler during his time in the U.S. Senate is included in the collection of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies in their chambers on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

==Legacy==

Butler&#x27;s legacy is surrounded by considerable debate among scholars of the era. Progressive historians, who tend to look favorably on the goals of the Populist Movement in general have often discarded Butler&#x27;s fusionism, silver-backed currency and emphasis on white supremacy as being &quot;un-Populist&quot;. In refuting this analysis, some historians point to Butler&#x27;s immense popularity among Populist adherents, and to the fact that Butler held at different times the Presidency of the National Farmers&#x27; Alliance and was Chairman of the Populist Party itself.

Regardless of the classification of Butler&#x27;s beliefs and actions, it is undisputed that his actions and rhetoric were extremely influential in the North Carolina and national Populist movement, especially after the death of Leonidas L. Polk, the movement&#x27;s elder statesman, in 1892.

The Marion Butler Birthplace was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.

<text>In numerical analysis, one of the most important problems is designing efficient and stable algorithms for finding the eigenvalues of a matrix. These eigenvalue algorithms may also find eigenvectors.

==Eigenvalues and eigenvectors==

Given an square matrix of real or complex numbers, an &quot;eigenvalue&quot; and its associated &quot;generalized eigenvector&quot; are a pair obeying the relation

:formula_1

where is a nonzero column vector, is the identity matrix, is a positive integer, and both and are allowed to be complex even when is real.l When , the vector is called simply an &quot;eigenvector&quot;, and the pair is called an &quot;eigenpair&quot;. In this case, . Any eigenvalue of has ordinary eigenvectors associated to it, for if is the smallest integer such that for a generalized eigenvector , then is an ordinary eigenvector. The value can always be taken as less than or equal to . In particular, for all generalized eigenvectors associated with .

For each eigenvalue of , the kernel consists of all eigenvectors associated with (along with 0), called the &quot;eigenspace&quot; of , while the vector space consists of all generalized eigenvectors, and is called the &quot;generalized eigenspace&quot;. The &quot;geometric multiplicity&quot; of is the dimension of its eigenspace. The &quot;algebraic multiplicity&quot; of is the dimension of its generalized eigenspace. The latter terminology is justified by the equation

:formula_2

where is the determinant function, the are all the distinct eigenvalues of and the are the corresponding algebraic multiplicities. The function is the &quot;characteristic polynomial&quot; of . So the algebraic multiplicity is the multiplicity of the eigenvalue as a zero of the characteristic polynomial. Since any eigenvector is also a generalized eigenvector, the geometric multiplicity is less than or equal to the algebraic multiplicity. The algebraic multiplicities sum up to , the degree of the characteristic polynomial. The equation is called the &quot;characteristic equation&quot;, as its roots are exactly the eigenvalues of . By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, itself obeys the same equation: . As a consequence, the columns of the matrix formula_3 must be either 0 or generalized eigenvectors of the eigenvalue , since they are annihilated by formula_4. In fact, the column space is the generalized eigenspace of .

Any collection of generalized eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues is linearly independent, so a basis for all of can be chosen consisting of generalized eigenvectors. More particularly, this basis can be chosen and organized so that
* if and have the same eigenvalue, then so does for each between and , and
* if is not an ordinary eigenvector, and if is its eigenvalue, then (in particular, must be an ordinary eigenvector).
If these basis vectors are placed as the column vectors of a matrix , then can be used to convert to its Jordan normal form:
:formula_5

where the are the eigenvalues, if and otherwise.

More generally, if is any invertible matrix, and is an eigenvalue of with generalized eigenvector , then . Thus is an eigenvalue of with generalized eigenvector . That is, similar matrices have the same eigenvalues.

===Normal, Hermitian, and real-symmetric matrices===

The adjoint of a complex matrix is the transpose of the conjugate of : . A square matrix is called &quot;normal&quot; if it commutes with its adjoint: . It is called &quot;Hermitian&quot; if it is equal to its adjoint: . All Hermitian matrices are normal. If has only real elements, then the adjoint is just the transpose, and is Hermitian if and only if it is symmetric. When applied to column vectors, the adjoint can be used to define the canonical inner product on : . Normal, Hermitian, and real-symmetric matrices have several useful properties:
* Every generalized eigenvector of a normal matrix is an ordinary eigenvector.
* Any normal matrix is similar to a diagonal matrix, since its Jordan normal form is diagonal.
* Eigenvectors of distinct eigenvalues of a normal matrix are orthogonal. 
* The null space and the image (or column space) of a normal matrix are orthogonal to each other. 
* For any normal matrix , has an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of . The corresponding matrix of eigenvectors is unitary.
* The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real, since for a non-zero eigenvector .
* If is real, there is an orthonormal basis for consisting of eigenvectors of if and only if is symmetric.

It is possible for a real or complex matrix to have all real eigenvalues without being Hermitian. For example, a real triangular matrix has its eigenvalues along its diagonal, but in general is not symmetric.

==Condition number==

Any problem of numeric calculation can be viewed as the evaluation of some function for some input . The condition number of the problem is the ratio of the relative error in the function&#x27;s output to the relative error in the input, and varies with both the function and the input. The condition number describes how error grows during the calculation. Its base-10 logarithm tells how many fewer digits of accuracy exist in the result than existed in the input. The condition number is a best-case scenario. It reflects the instability built into the problem, regardless of how it is solved. No algorithm can ever produce more accurate results than indicated by the condition number, except by chance. However, a poorly designed algorithm may produce significantly worse results. For example, as mentioned below, the problem of finding eigenvalues for normal matrices is always well-conditioned. However, the problem of finding the roots of a polynomial can be very ill-conditioned. Thus eigenvalue algorithms that work by finding the roots of the characteristic polynomial can be ill-conditioned even when the problem is not.

For the problem of solving the linear equation where is invertible, the matrix condition number is given by , where is the operator norm subordinate to the normal Euclidean norm on . Since this number is independent of and is the same for and , it is usually just called the condition number of the matrix . This value is also the absolute value of the ratio of the largest singular value of to its smallest. If is unitary, then , so . For general matrices, the operator norm is often difficult to calculate. For this reason, other matrix norms are commonly used to estimate the condition number.

For the eigenvalue problem, Bauer and Fike proved that if is an eigenvalue for a diagonalizable matrix with eigenvector matrix , then the absolute error in calculating is bounded by the product of and the absolute error in . As a result, the condition number for finding is . If is normal, then is unitary, and . Thus the eigenvalue problem for all normal matrices is well-conditioned.

The condition number for the problem of finding the eigenspace of a normal matrix corresponding to an eigenvalue has been shown to be inversely proportional to the minimum distance between and the other distinct eigenvalues of . In particular, the eigenspace problem for normal matrices is well-conditioned for isolated eigenvalues. When eigenvalues are not isolated, the best that can be hoped for is to identify the span of all eigenvectors of nearby eigenvalues.

==Algorithms==

The most reliable and most widely used algorithm for computing eigenvalues is John G. F. Francis&#x27; and Vera N. Kublanovskaya&#x27;s QR algorithm, considered one of the top ten algorithms of 20th century.

Any monic polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of its companion matrix. Therefore, a general algorithm for finding eigenvalues could also be used to find the roots of polynomials. The Abel–Ruffini theorem shows that any such algorithm for dimensions greater than 4 must either be infinite, or involve functions of greater complexity than elementary arithmetic operations and fractional powers. For this reason algorithms that exactly calculate eigenvalues in a finite number of steps only exist for a few special classes of matrices. For general matrices, algorithms are iterative, producing better approximate solutions with each iteration.

Some algorithms produce every eigenvalue, others will produce a few, or only one. However, even the latter algorithms can be used to find all eigenvalues. Once an eigenvalue of a matrix has been identified, it can be used to either direct the algorithm towards a different solution next time, or to reduce the problem to one that no longer has as a solution.

Redirection is usually accomplished by shifting: replacing with for some constant . The eigenvalue found for must have added back in to get an eigenvalue for . For example, for power iteration, . Power iteration finds the largest eigenvalue in absolute value, so even when is only an approximate eigenvalue, power iteration is unlikely to find it a second time. Conversely, inverse iteration based methods find the lowest eigenvalue, so is chosen well away from and hopefully closer to some other eigenvalue.

Reduction can be accomplished by restricting to the column space of the matrix , which carries to itself. Since is singular, the column space is of lesser dimension. The eigenvalue algorithm can then be applied to the restricted matrix. This process can be repeated until all eigenvalues are found.

If an eigenvalue algorithm does not produce eigenvectors, a common practice is to use an inverse iteration based algorithm with set to a close approximation to the eigenvalue. This will quickly converge to the eigenvector of the closest eigenvalue to . For small matrices, an alternative is to look at the column space of the product of for each of the other eigenvalues .

A formula for the norm of unit eigenvector components of normal matrices was discovered by Robert Thompson in 1966 and rediscovered independently by several others.
If is an formula_6 normal matrix with eigenvalues and corresponding unit eigenvectors whose component entries are , let be the formula_7 matrix obtained by removing the -th row and column from , and let be its -th eigenvalue. Then
formula_8

If formula_9 are the characteristic polynomials of formula_10 and formula_11, the formula can be re-written as 
formula_12
assuming the derivative formula_13 is not zero at formula_14.

==Hessenberg and tridiagonal matrices==

Because the eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal elements, for general matrices there is no finite method like gaussian elimination to convert a matrix to triangular form while preserving eigenvalues. But it is possible to reach something close to triangular. An upper Hessenberg matrix is a square matrix for which all entries below the subdiagonal are zero. A lower Hessenberg matrix is one for which all entries above the superdiagonal are zero. Matrices that are both upper and lower Hessenberg are tridiagonal. Hessenberg and tridiagonal matrices are the starting points for many eigenvalue algorithms because the zero entries reduce the complexity of the problem. Several methods are commonly used to convert a general matrix into a Hessenberg matrix with the same eigenvalues. If the original matrix was symmetric or Hermitian, then the resulting matrix will be tridiagonal.

When only eigenvalues are needed, there is no need to calculate the similarity matrix, as the transformed matrix has the same eigenvalues. If eigenvectors are needed as well, the similarity matrix may be needed to transform the eigenvectors of the Hessenberg matrix back into eigenvectors of the original matrix.

For symmetric tridiagonal eigenvalue problems all eigenvalues (without eigenvectors) can be computed numerically in time O(n log(n)), using bisection on the characteristic polynomial.

==Iterative algorithms==
Iterative algorithms solve the eigenvalue problem by producing sequences that converge to the eigenvalues. Some algorithms also produce sequences of vectors that converge to the eigenvectors. Most commonly, the eigenvalue sequences are expressed as sequences of similar matrices which converge to a triangular or diagonal form, allowing the eigenvalues to be read easily. The eigenvector sequences are expressed as the corresponding similarity matrices.

==Direct calculation==

While there is no simple algorithm to directly calculate eigenvalues for general matrices, there are numerous special classes of matrices where eigenvalues can be directly calculated. These include:

===Triangular matrices===

Since the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries, if &quot;T&quot; is triangular, then formula_15. Thus the eigenvalues of &quot;T&quot; are its diagonal entries.

===Factorable polynomial equations===

If is any polynomial and then the eigenvalues of also satisfy the same equation. If happens to have a known factorization, then the eigenvalues of lie among its roots.

For example, a projection is a square matrix satisfying . The roots of the corresponding scalar polynomial equation, , are 0 and 1. Thus any projection has 0 and 1 for its eigenvalues. The multiplicity of 0 as an eigenvalue is the nullity of , while the multiplicity of 1 is the rank of .

Another example is a matrix that satisfies for some scalar . The eigenvalues must be . The projection operators
:formula_16

:formula_17
satisfy
:formula_18
and
:formula_19

The column spaces of and are the eigenspaces of corresponding to and , respectively.

===2×2 matrices===

For dimensions 2 through 4, formulas involving radicals exist that can be used to find the eigenvalues. While a common practice for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices, for 4×4 matrices the increasing complexity of the root formulas makes this approach less attractive.

For the 2×2 matrix

:formula_20

the characteristic polynomial is

:formula_21

Thus the eigenvalues can be found by using the quadratic formula:

:formula_22

Defining formula_23 to be the distance between the two eigenvalues, it is straightforward to calculate

:formula_24

with similar formulas for {{math|&quot;c&quot;}} and {{math|&quot;d&quot;}}. From this it follows that the calculation is well-conditioned if the eigenvalues are isolated.

Eigenvectors can be found by exploiting the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. If {{math|&quot;λ&quot;1, &quot;λ&quot;2}} are the eigenvalues, then {{math|1=(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;I&quot;) = (&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;1&quot;I&quot;) = 0}}, so the columns of {{math|(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;2&quot;I&quot;)}} are annihilated by {{math|(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;λ&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)}} and vice versa. Assuming neither matrix is zero, the columns of each must include eigenvectors for the other eigenvalue. (If either matrix is zero, then {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} is a multiple of the identity and any non-zero vector is an eigenvector.)

For example, suppose

:formula_25

then {{math|1=tr(&quot;A&quot;) = 4 − 3 = 1}} and {{math|1=det(&quot;A&quot;) = 4(−3) − 3(−2) = −6}}, so the characteristic equation is

:formula_26

and the eigenvalues are 3 and -2. Now,

:formula_27

In both matrices, the columns are multiples of each other, so either column can be used. Thus, {{math|(1, −2)}} can be taken as an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue -2, and {{math|(3, −1)}} as an eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 3, as can be verified by multiplying them by {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}.

===Symmetric 3×3 matrices===

The characteristic equation of a symmetric 3×3 matrix {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} is:

:formula_28

This equation may be solved using the methods of Cardano or Lagrange, but an affine change to {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} will simplify the expression considerably, and lead directly to a trigonometric solution. If {{math|1=&quot;A&quot; = &quot;pB&quot; + &quot;qI&quot;}}, then {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} and {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} have the same eigenvectors, and {{math|&quot;β&quot;}} is an eigenvalue of {{math|&quot;B&quot;}} if and only if {{math|1=&quot;α&quot; = &quot;pβ&quot; + &quot;q&quot;}} is an eigenvalue of {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}. Letting formula_29 and formula_30, gives

:formula_31

The substitution {{math|1=&quot;β&quot; = 2cos &quot;θ&quot;}} and some simplification using the identity {{math|1=cos 3&quot;θ&quot; = 4cos3 &quot;θ&quot; − 3cos &quot;θ&quot;}} reduces the equation to {{math|1=cos 3&quot;θ&quot; = det(&quot;B&quot;) / 2}}. Thus

:formula_32

If {{math|det(&quot;B&quot;)}} is complex or is greater than 2 in absolute value, the arccosine should be taken along the same branch for all three values of {{math|&quot;k&quot;}}. This issue doesn&#x27;t arise when {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} is real and symmetric, resulting in a simple algorithm:
% Given a real symmetric 3x3 matrix A, compute the eigenvalues
% Note that acos and cos operate on angles in radians

p1 = A(1,2)^2 + A(1,3)^2 + A(2,3)^2
if (p1 == 0) 
 % A is diagonal.
 eig1 = A(1,1)
 eig2 = A(2,2)
 eig3 = A(3,3)
else
 q = trace(A)/3 % trace(A) is the sum of all diagonal values
 p2 = (A(1,1) - q)^2 + (A(2,2) - q)^2 + (A(3,3) - q)^2 + 2 * p1
 p = sqrt(p2 / 6)
 B = (1 / p) * (A - q * I) % I is the identity matrix
 r = det(B) / 2

 % In exact arithmetic for a symmetric matrix -1 &lt;= r &lt;= 1
 % but computation error can leave it slightly outside this range.
 if (r &lt;= -1) 
 phi = pi / 3
 elseif (r &gt;= 1)
 phi = 0
 else
 phi = acos(r) / 3
 end

 % the eigenvalues satisfy eig3 &lt;= eig2 &lt;= eig1
 eig1 = q + 2 * p * cos(phi)
 eig3 = q + 2 * p * cos(phi + (2*pi/3))
 eig2 = 3 * q - eig1 - eig3 % since trace(A) = eig1 + eig2 + eig3
end
Once again, the eigenvectors of {{math|&quot;A&quot;}} can be obtained by recourse to the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. If {{math|&quot;α&quot;1, &quot;α&quot;2, &quot;α&quot;3}} are distinct eigenvalues of {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}, then {{math|1=(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;2&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;3&quot;I&quot;) = 0}}. Thus the columns of the product of any two of these matrices will contain an eigenvector for the third eigenvalue. However, if {{math|1=&quot;α&quot;3 = &quot;α&quot;1}}, then {{math|1=(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)2(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;2&quot;I&quot;) = 0}} and {{math|1=(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;2&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)2 = 0}}. Thus the &quot;generalized&quot; eigenspace of {{math|&quot;α&quot;1}} is spanned by the columns of {{math|&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;2&quot;I&quot;}} while the ordinary eigenspace is spanned by the columns of {{math|1=(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;2&quot;I&quot;)}}. The ordinary eigenspace of {{math|&quot;α&quot;2}} is spanned by the columns of {{math|(&quot;A&quot; − &quot;α&quot;1&quot;I&quot;)2}}.

For example, let

:formula_33

The characteristic equation is

:formula_34

with eigenvalues 1 (of multiplicity 2) and -1. Calculating,

:formula_35

and

:formula_36

Thus {{math|(−4, −4, 4)}} is an eigenvector for −1, and {{math|(4, 2, −2)}} is an eigenvector for 1. {{math|(2, 3, −1)}} and {{math|(6, 5, −3)}} are both generalized eigenvectors associated with 1, either one of which could be combined with {{math|(−4, −4, 4)}} and {{math|(4, 2, −2)}} to form a basis of generalized eigenvectors of {{math|&quot;A&quot;}}. Once found, the eigenvectors can be normalized if needed.

==== Eigenvectors of normal 3×3 matrices ====
If a 3×3 matrix formula_10 is normal, then the cross-product can be used to find eigenvectors. If formula_38 is an eigenvalue of formula_10, then the null space of formula_40 is perpendicular to its column space. The cross product of two independent columns of formula_40 will be in the null space. That is, it will be an eigenvector associated with formula_38. Since the column space is two dimensional in this case, the eigenspace must be one dimensional, so any other eigenvector will be parallel to it.

If formula_40 does not contain two independent columns but is not {{math|0}}, the cross-product can still be used. In this case formula_38 is an eigenvalue of multiplicity 2, so any vector perpendicular to the column space will be an eigenvector. Suppose formula_45 is a non-zero column of formula_40. Choose an arbitrary vector formula_47 not parallel to formula_45. Then formula_49 and formula_50 will be perpendicular to formula_45 and thus will be eigenvectors of formula_38.

This does not work when formula_10 is not normal, as the null space and column space do not need to be perpendicular for such matrices.

<text>Furnifold McLendel Simmons (January 20, 1854April 30, 1940) was an American politician who served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1887, to March 4, 1889, and U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between March 4, 1901, and March 4, 1931. He served as chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance from March 4, 1913, to March 4, 1919. He was an unsuccessful contender for the 1920 Democratic Party nomination for president. Simmons was a staunch segregationist and white supremacist, and a leading perpetrator of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898.

==Life and career==
Simmons was born in Pollocksville, North Carolina, the son of Mary McLendel (Jerman) and Furnifold Greene Simmons. After Republicans won control of the North Carolina legislature in 1894, Simmons led efforts to disenfranchise black voters and return Democrats to power across the state. He allied with white supremacist newspapers to stoke fears of black men as predators of white women and too incompetent to be trusted as office holders or voters. Simmons also set up hundreds of &quot;White Government Unions,&quot; which aimed to &quot;announce on all occasions that they would succeed if they had to shoot every negro in the city.&quot; As a result, Democrats swept the 1898 election, and the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 broke out the following day.

In 1901 Simmons won the Democratic nomination for the US Senate. From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts &quot;to keep the machine oiled back home,&quot; in the words of one journalist. Simmons remained in office for the next thirty years.

Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928 and the first Catholic nominated by a major party, winning him praise from members of the Ku Klux Klan. Still, rejecting the Democratic nominee in 1928, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O. Max Gardner.

<text>John McCreary Fabian (born January 28, 1939) is a former NASA astronaut and Air Force officer who flew two Space Shuttle missions and worked on the development of the Shuttle&#x27;s robotic arm. He later led the Air Force&#x27;s space operations.

==Personal data==
Born January 28, 1939, in Goose Creek, Texas, but considers Pullman, Washington, to be his hometown. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. Recreational interests include politics and environmental advocacy.

In 1998 he retired to Port Ludlow, Washington, bordered by Hood Canal and the Olympic Mountains on northwest Washington&#x27;s Olympic Peninsula. In 2002 he helped form the Hood Canal Coalition, an environmental watchdog group opposing a new industrial harbor complex and a gravel mine&#x27;s shipping operation slated to transverse the Hood Canal Bridge.

From 2000 to 2011, he participated in the &quot;Lunch with an Astronaut&quot; and &quot;Astronaut Encounter&quot; events at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. He resumed his involvement in 2022, and has since been a regular feature in the restructured &quot;Chat with an Astronaut&quot; program, as well as &quot;Astronaut Encounter&quot;.

==Education==
Graduated from Pullman High School, Pullman, Washington, in 1957; received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Washington State University in 1962; a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology in 1964; and a doctorate in aeronautics and astronautics from the University of Washington in 1974. While at Washington State University, he was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Member of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau engineering honor societies.
WSU Commander of Arnold Air Society 1960–61.

==Military experience==
Fabian, an Air Force ROTC student at Washington State University, was commissioned upon graduation in 1962. After an assignment at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, he was assigned as an aeronautics engineer in the service engineering division, San Antonio Air Material Area, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas. He then attended flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and subsequently spent 5 years as a KC-135 co-pilot, aircraft commander, and instructor pilot at Wurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan. He saw action in Southeast Asia, flying 90 combat missions during the Vietnam War. Following additional graduate work at the University of Washington, he served 4 years on the faculty of the Aeronautics Department at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado where he was a tenured associate professor.

He has logged 4,000 hours flying time, including 3,400 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA experience==
Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978, and became an astronaut in August 1979. During the following years, he worked extensively on satellite deployment and retrieval activities, including development of the Canadian Remote Manipulator System. A veteran of two space flights, he has logged over 316 hours in space. He served as a mission specialist on STS-7 (June 18 – 24, 1983) and STS-51G (June 17–24, 1985). He was scheduled to fly next in May 1986 on STS-61G, and was also in training for space shuttle life science mission SLS-1. Fabian instead left NASA on January 1, 1986, to become Director of Space, Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Operations, Headquarters USAF.

Colonel Fabian retired from the USAF in June 1987 and joined Analytic Services, a non-profit aerospace public service research institute in Arlington, Virginia, where he retired as president and chief executive officer in 1998. He currently lives in Port Ludlow, Washington. Fabian continues to serve as an independent consultant and public speaker on the NASA space program and environmental stewardship.

===Space flight experience===
Fabian first flew as a mission specialist on STS-7, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight for the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and for the first mission with a 5-person crew. During the mission, the crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (PALAPA B-1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the Orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2): and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven Getaway Specials, Mission duration was 147 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1983.

Fabian was the first person to deploy and subsequently retrieve a free-flying satellite. In doing so, he used the Canadian-built robotic arm to release and later recapture the SPAS-01 satellite.

On his second mission, Fabian flew on STS-51-G which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1985, after completing approximately 170 hours of space flight. This international crew deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States (AT&amp;T Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials, participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative.

<doc id="516570" wikidata="Q48854" url="?curid=516570" title="NBA Live">
<text>NBA Live is a series of basketball video games that was published by EA Sports. The series, which debuted in 1994, is the successor to the previous &quot;NBA Playoffs&quot; and &quot;NBA Showdown&quot; series.

Beginning in the late 2000s, &quot;NBA Live&quot; sales had dropped off compared to its main competitor, 2K&#x27;s &quot;NBA 2K&quot; series. The last released installment to date is 2018&#x27;s &quot;NBA Live 19&quot;. As of 2023, the series has been in an indefinite hiatus, and after the cancellations of &quot;NBA Live 20&quot; and &quot;NBA Live 21&quot;, there has not been any official confirmation by EA on whether or not the series will continue.

==&quot;NBA Playoffs&quot;==
The predecessor of the NBA Live series was the &quot;NBA Playoffs&quot; series, which featured &quot;Lakers vs. Celtics&quot;, released first in 1989 for MS-DOS-compatible PCs and later adapted for consoles in early 1990 for the Sega Mega Drive. This game was played from a horizontal view (while later versions moved to an isometric view before ultimately moving to 3D on newer consoles). The game was one of the first to feature an NBA license, containing both real NBA teams and player likenesses and signature moves. Details such as Horace Grant&#x27;s goggles are clearly visible, and Michael Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Air Reverse Layup&quot; is animated with very high accuracy. Player numbers were also visible. The game featured only eight of the sixteen teams that qualified for the NBA playoffs that year, as well as both NBA All-Star teams.

The next game in the series was &quot;Bulls vs. Lakers&quot;, released in 1991, followed by &quot;Bulls vs. Blazers&quot; in 1992. Unlike the first game, these two releases were titled after the two teams who were in the NBA Finals the previous season, while the original release apparently chose the Lakers and Celtics due to both teams&#x27; historical success, in particular their rivalry in the 1980s. Each revision added more teams and players, as well as more signature moves. The series also included an Olympic basketball spinoff game, &quot;Team USA Basketball&quot; (1992) which uses the same engine. The final game in the series was &quot;NBA Showdown 94&quot; for the Sega Genesis before the transition to the &quot;NBA Live&quot; naming.

==History==
In the fall of ‘94, the annual EA basketball release received a simpler title of &quot;NBA Live 95&quot;. This naming pattern using the forthcoming year has continued, except for varying to use of all 4 digits of the year from &quot;2000&quot; to &quot;2005&quot;. Each version&#x27;s initial release was in the fall near the start of the NBA campaign, though additional ports were sometimes delayed until as late as January or February. After 16 consecutive seasons of releases, an effort to retool the game as &quot;NBA Elite 11&quot; met with development troubles, and put the game on hiatus for three years. The series returned with &quot;NBA Live 14&quot; in November 2013.

The pioneer &quot;NBA Live 95&quot; release was for fourth generation video game systems Sega Genesis and SNES, as well as the MS-DOS operating system. &quot;NBA Live 96&quot; included the first fifth generation version, with the PlayStation, and also the first handheld games version, on the Game Boy. Sixth generation production started with &quot;NBA Live 2001&quot; and continued all the way through &quot;NBA Live 2009&quot; on the high selling &quot;PlayStation 2&quot;. &quot;NBA Live 06&quot; was the first to hit seventh generation consoles, after its release to the Xbox 360. Finally, with the release of &quot;NBA Live 14&quot; for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, EA continued its run on into eighth generation consoles. The game was released on PC each season until support was pulled after the &quot;NBA Live 08&quot; season.

The Create-A-Player feature was not available in the 1995 versions of the game, but has been a mainstay since &quot;NBA Live 96.

&quot;NBA Live 99&quot; was the first to feature Practice Mode and Multi-season play.

Starting in &quot;NBA Live 2000&quot;, the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams, that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Through the series, some of the Legend rosters were changed for various reasons. Michael Jordan was on the &#x27;90s team through 2004 before being removed due to licensing in later versions. Spud Webb, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Tom Chambers were added to the rosters in &quot;NBA Live 06&quot;.

&quot;NBA Live 2005&quot; brought the addition of the Freestyle Air, NBA All-Star Weekend, which includes the Rookie Challenge, Three Point Shootout, Slam Dunk Contest, and the NBA All-Star Game, and Freestyle Challenge, which two players or more can play the Three Point Shootout or the Slam Dunk Contest.

In &quot;NBA Live 08,&quot; a limited number of international teams were added under FIBA&#x27;s license. This was also the last release for the Microsoft Windows platform.

&quot;NBA Live 09&quot; added a feature called Dynamic DNA, the first concept of daily updates changing tendencies, rosters, and hot-cold streaks.

After the release of &quot;NBA Live 10&quot;, EA attempted to retool the series under a new name with &quot;NBA Elite 11&quot;. However, the game was met with bad publicity and development problems before release and was cancelled (though a playable demo was released for download, and several copies of the full release found their way to customers). In November 2010, development of the franchise was moved from EA Canada studio to Florida-based Tiburon studio. It was eventually announced that the series&#x27; next installment would be released in Fall 2012 and would return to the &quot;NBA Live&quot; name as &quot;NBA Live 13&quot;, but it would later be announced, on September 27, 2012, that they would cancel the release. It wasn&#x27;t until the fall of 2013, that the next game, &quot;NBA Live 14&quot;, would be released. Prior to its release, EA Sports had sold 33.54 million copies of the video game series since &quot;NBA Live 95&quot;, just falling short of its main competitor, NBA 2K&#x27;s 37.24 million copies sold since its inception in 1999.

&quot;NBA Live 16&quot; was released on September 29, 2015. NBA Live Mobile was released on July 6, 2016. It is mostly used to play Ultimate Team modes in the game. &quot;NBA Live 18&quot; was released on September 15, 2017, and features players from the WNBA. It also added a new single player mode called &quot;The One&quot;, in which the player controls an NBA prospect throughout his career. &quot;NBA Live 19&quot; was released on September 7, 2018, and expanded on &quot;The One&quot;, by adding the ability to make a female player, as well as other game modes. NBA Live 20 was canceled by the development team due to them trying to expand into the next generation of consoles, as announced on the team&#x27;s Twitter. &quot;NBA Live 21&quot; was also cancelled for the same reason.

<doc id="516571" wikidata="Q584111" url="?curid=516571" title="Disc dog">
<text>Disc dog (commonly called Frisbee dog) is a dog sport. In disc dog competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching. The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together. The term &quot;disc&quot; is preferred because &quot;Frisbee&quot; is a trademark (held by Wham-O) for a brand of flying disc.

==History==
The sport got its start in the early 1970s, paralleling the rise in popularity of Frisbee sport. The definitive moment came on August 5, 1974, when Alex Stein, a 19-year-old college student from Ohio, and his dog, Ashley Whippet, jumped the fence at a nationally broadcast baseball game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cincinnati Reds. Stein had with him a couple of flying discs, which he threw for the dog. Ashley astonished the crowd with his disc-catching, as he ran up to and leaped in the air to snag the disc. The stunt was so novel that the game was stopped and Joe Garagiola continued to announce the flying disc action on the field. Finally, after eight minutes, Stein was escorted off the field and arrested. The nationally televised exhibition of Ashley&#x27;s skill did much to fuel interest in the sport.

Stein worked with Irv Lander and Eldon McIntire to create the Frisbee Dog World Championship for people and their dogs. Even today, Stein and McIntire continue to contribute to the sport.

==Format==
Teams of one person and one dog compete in the standard distance &quot;toss and fetch&quot; event. Points are awarded to the team for catches at varying distances. Competitions also often feature the dynamic freestyle event, which consists of short routines choreographed to music with multiple discs in play. The less common long-distance events have various formats, but generally the longest catch wins.

Divisions in disc dog events are usually based on the skill and experience of the handler. Men and women generally compete in the same divisions for all disciplines, although the long distance category is sometimes divided by gender.

===Toss and fetch===
Short-distance events go by many names, including toss and fetch, mini-distance, throw and catch, and distance/accuracy. The concept is generally the same. Contestants have 60 seconds to make as many throws as possible on a field marked with increasingly longer distances. The distances generally do not exceed for the longest catches. Dogs are awarded points for catches based on the distance of the throw, with mid-air catches rating extra points (in most contests an extra half point when the dog is completely airborne for the catch). Only one disc is used for these events.

===Freestyle===
Freestyle is a subjectively judged event, similar to freestyle events like skateboard and snowboard half-pipe, or freestyle footbag (hacky sack). The team consists of one person (handler) and his or her dog. Depending on the event, the length of a routine might be anywhere from one minute and 30 seconds all the way to two minutes. Teams are judged in categories that include canine athleticism, degree of difficulty, showmanship, and so forth. Incredible flips, hyperfast multiple catches, and spectacular vaults make freestyle a popular event with spectators, and it is regarded as the highest level of competitive accomplishment.

===Long distance===
The Quadruped was an NFL draft day competition held in April 1996 for the Jacksonville Jaguars. This competition format is older than all other disc dog competition formats other than the Ashley Whippet and the FDDO formats. Originally a halftime show for football games with four frisbee dog teams competing to be the last team standing. It turned into an open competition where many more than four teams were able to compete. Today we have the Quadruped Series, a group of competitions that are a points championship in the United States. The popularity has been so great within the frisbee dog world that it has spread to Europe where it has occurred in several countries.

==Competitions==
Today there are several organizations running disc dog tournaments. Most competitions take place in the summer on flat, grassy fields. Winter disc dog contests on soft snow are also popular in places.

===Ashley Whippet Invitational===
The Canine Frisbee Disc World Championship (also called the World Finals Championship) was long considered the crowning culmination of the sport.

===Skyhoundz===
In 2000, Skyhoundz staged its very first World Canine Disc Championship, sponsored by Hyperflite. The Hyperflite Skyhoundz World Canine Disc Championship Series is now the largest disc dog competition series in the world and features, each year, more than 100 competitions held in the U.S. and other countries, as well as U.S. Local Championships, State Championships, DiscDogathon Championship Qualifiers, a DiscDogathon World Championship, Xtreme Distance Championship Qualifiers, an Xtreme Distance World Championship, U.S. Regional Qualifiers, Open Qualifiers, International Qualifiers, a European Championship, and the World Championship. In 2011, the Hyperflite Skyhoundz Series will be expanded to include a week-long World Championship extravaganza that will include a World Canine Disc Championship in five Divisions (Open, Sport, Pairs Freestyle, MicroDog, and Youth) as well as an Xtreme Distance World Championship (and associated Last Chance Open Qualifier), and a DiscDogathon World Championship (and associated Last Chance Open Qualifier). Participants in the week-long Skyhoundz World Championship will have at least three opportunities at various Last Chance Open Qualifiers to qualify for the remaining invitations to compete for World Championship titles. Skyhoundz is the only canine disc organization to offer disc dog titling in conjunction with its competition series.

===UFO===
The UFO organization runs the UFO World Cup Series. The series is a &quot;points series&quot;, similar to World Cup Skiing or NASCAR. The series culminates in World Cup Final. In 2006, UFO also ran the AWI World Championship in Scottsdale, Arizona.

=== The Quadruped ===
The oldest and most popular long-distance frisbee dog competition in the frisbee dog world.

===Other disc dog organizations===
The US Disc Dog Nationals (USDDN), which has clubs organizing events in the US, Japan, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Canada, Australia and Turkey holds a championship series known as the USDDN Finals and US Disc Dog International Finals. Other competitions are sponsored by the Quadruped, the Flying Disc Dog Open, and the Purina Incredible Dog Challenge.

The United Kingdom has the UK Disc Dog Association (UKDDA), which held seasonal competitions from March 2018 at The Dog Training Barn, Banbury, Oxfordshire, for the first time ever.

==Popularity==
Part of the popularity of the sport is its accessibility. All that is necessary to enjoy it is a level playing area, a dog, and a flying disc. Also, a little imagination is an extra plus for Freestyle competition. It is estimated that over one million dogs play flying disc in the United States alone, though only a small percentage participate in organized competitions.

Disc dogs are also popular attractions at sporting events as half-time entertainment. Going clear back to Ashley and his 8th inning performance in 1974, disc dogs have performed at countless football, basketball, baseball and soccer halftimes. They are many times found in amusement parks, county fairs and pet festivals of all kinds. There are a very small handful of trainers who even make a living doing these shows.

==Disc dog clubs==
Disc dog clubs organize and promote the sport on a local level, and work with national organizations to run events. They offer newcomers a way to learn more about the sport, and are a great place for the experienced competitors to give back. Disc dog clubs are usually active in local animal charities, helping to raise money and awareness for such groups. Disc dog clubs can be found all over the United States, Europe, Asia, Canada and Australia. The first club was the Dallas Dog and Disc Club, founded in the mid-1980s by Ron Ellis.

==Dog discs==
It is crucial to use a proper dog disc, as those used for Disc Golf and Ultimate are not intended to be used with dogs. When choosing a disc, it should pass at least a small test – it has to be folded in half and regain initial form without damage.
Dog discs usually vary in size from 18 to 24 cm in diameter and 90–150 grams in weight and are made of plastic, with lighter discs usually being less puncture and scratch resistant. Discs before play always should be checked for deformations and splinters in order not to damage dogs&#x27; teeth and mouth and players&#x27; hands.

* Yikun (China) - Spacedog

==Disc dog training==

Not all dogs immediately understand the concept of the game. A dog may not instinctively know to turn and chase after a disc that is thrown over its head. To begin, the disc should be thrown straight to the dog at a short distance. Once a dog knows how to catch, it can learn the additional concept of running to catch the disc. The disc should be thrown at increasing heights, gradually throwing the disc higher, until it finally goes over the dog&#x27;s head. At that point the dog instinctively follows the disc all the way around.

== Mental Stimulation ==
Frisbee catching isn&#x27;t just about physical prowess; it also requires mental focus and problem-solving skills. Dogs must anticipate the flight path of the Frisbee, enhancing their cognitive abilities.

<text>Daniel Charles Brandenstein (born January 17, 1943) is the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of United Space Alliance. He is a former Naval Aviator, test pilot and NASA astronaut, who flew four Space Shuttle missions. He also served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from 1987 to 1992.

== Career ==
===Military ===
After graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics and physics from the University of Wisconsin–River Falls, and having been a member of Phi Sigma Kappa, Brandenstein entered active duty with the U.S. Navy in September 1965 and was attached to the Naval Air Training Command for flight training. He was designated a Naval Aviator at Naval Air Station Beeville, Texas, in May 1967 and then proceeded to attack squadron VA-128 for A-6 Intruder fleet replacement training. From 1968 to 1970, while attached to VA-196 flying A-6s, he participated in two combat deployments on board the aircraft carriers and to Southeast Asia where he flew 192 combat missions in the Vietnam War. In subsequent assignments, he was attached to VX-5 for the conduct of operational tests of A-6 weapons systems and tactics; and to the Naval Air Test Center, where upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, he conducted tests of electronic warfare systems in various Navy aircraft. Brandenstein carried out a nine-month deployment to the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean on board USS &quot;Ranger&quot; while attached to VA-145, flying A-6 Intruders during the period March 1975 to September 1977. Before reporting to the Johnson Space Center in Houston as an astronaut candidate, he was attached to VA-128 as an A-6 flight instructor.

===NASA===
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Brandenstein became an astronaut in August 1979. He was ascent spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) and a member of the astronaut support crew for STS-1 (the first flight of the Space Shuttle). He was subsequently assigned to the STS-2 astronaut support crew and was the ascent CAPCOM for the first two Space Shuttle flights. A veteran of four space flights—STS-8 (August 30 – September 3, 1983), STS-51-G (June 17–24, 1985), STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990), and STS-49 (May 7–16, 1992) -- Brandenstein has logged over 789 hours in space. Following his second space flight, he served as the Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations. Between April 1987 and September 1992 Brandenstein served as Chief of the Astronaut Office.

He retired from NASA and the United States Navy in October 1992.

Brandenstein was a pilot on STS-8, his first flight, which was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight for the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the first mission with a night launch and night landing. During the mission, crew members deployed the Indian National Satellite (INSAT-1B); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) with the Payload Flight Test Article (PFTA); operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) with live cell samples; conducted medical measurements to understand biophysiological effects on space flight and activated various Earth resources and space science experiments along with four &quot;Getaway Special&quot; canisters. STS-8 completed 98 orbits of the Earth in 145 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 3, 1983.

On his second mission (June 17–24, 1985), Brandenstein commanded the crew of STS-51-G aboard the Orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;. During this seven-day mission, crew members deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat) and the United States (AT&amp;T Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite, which performed 17 hours of X-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF) and six &quot;Getaway Specials&quot;, they also participated in biomedical experiments and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. The mission was accomplished in 112 Earth orbits over approximately 170 hours.

Brandenstein then commanded the crew of STS-32 (January 9–20, 1990). In the longest Shuttle mission to date, crew members aboard the Orbiter &quot;Columbia&quot; successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 9,724 kg (21,393 lb) Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also conducted a variety of mid-deck experiments, including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR) and the IMAX camera. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Following 173 orbits of the Earth in 261 hours, the mission ended with a night landing in California.

Brandenstein also commanded the crew of STS-49 (May 7 – 16, 1992), on the maiden flight of the new Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. During this mission, the crew conducted the initial test flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, performed a record four EVAs (space walks) to retrieve, repair and re-deploy the International Telecommunications Satellite (Intelsat) and to demonstrate and evaluate numerous EVA tasks to be used for the assembly of the Space Station &#x27;Freedom&#x27;. Additionally, a variety of medical, scientific and operational tests were conducted throughout the mission. STS-49 logged 213 hours in space and 141 Earth orbits before landing at Edwards AFB, where the crew conducted the first test of the &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s drag chute.

==Special honors and awards==
He was awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 17 Air Medals, the Navy Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster and Valor device, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, two NASA Outstanding Leadership Medals, four NASA Space Flight Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the French Legion of Honor, the Medal of King Abdul Aziz (Saudi Arabia), the Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross, the Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal. He is a Distinguished Alumnus at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls; an Honorary Doctor of Engineering at the Milwaukee School of Engineering; an Honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Wisconsin-River Falls. Brandenstein is a recipient of the SETP Iven C. Kincheloe Award, the AIAA Haley Space Flight Award, the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) Yuri Gagarin Gold Medal and the American Astronautical Society Flight Achievement Award. He was inducted into the Wisconsin Aviation Hall of Fame in 1992.

<text>Josiah William Bailey (September 14, 1873 – December 15, 1946) was an American politician who served as a U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina from 1931 to 1946.

==Early life and education==
Born in Warrenton, North Carolina, he grew up in Raleigh and graduated from Wake Forest College (now Wake Forest University).

== Career ==
Before turning to a career in law, Bailey was editor of the &quot;Biblical Recorder&quot;, a newspaper for North Carolina Baptists. He was a presidential elector in 1908.

Elected to the United States Senate in 1930, defeating longtime incumbent Furnifold McLendel Simmons, Bailey earned a reputation as a conservative while in office. In 1937, he coauthored the bipartisan Conservative Manifesto, a document criticizing President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and proposing more conservative alternatives. Among other things, the Manifesto called for lower taxes and less spending.

That same year, Bailey gave a rousing floor speech against President Roosevelt&#x27;s court-packing bill, which convinced at least three freshman Republicans, thought by Majority Leader Joe Robinson to be definite supporters, to oppose the measure.

A segregationist and white supremacist, Bailey filibustered anti-lynching legislation in 1938.

During his time in office, he served as chairman of the Committee on Claims and Committee on Commerce.

<text>Sitiveni Ligamamada Rabuka (; born 13 September 1948) is a Fijian politician, sportsman, and former soldier who has been serving as Prime Minister of Fiji since 24 December 2022. He was the instigator of two military coups in 1987. He was democratically elected as Prime Minister of Fiji, serving from 1992 to 1999, and again in 2022, leading a three-party coalition. He also served as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs from 1999 to 2001, and later as Chairman of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council from 2001 to 2008.

Rabuka was elected as leader of the Social Democratic Liberal Party in 2016, succeeding Leader of the Opposition Ro Teimumu Kepa, who publicly disapproved of Rabuka&#x27;s nomination to replace her. He was appointed as the leader of the Opposition to Parliament in 2018, following the 2018 election defeat. He was the only nomination for the position, and his nomination was moved by Ro Teimumu Kepa and seconded by Biman Prasad. He was ousted as SODELPA leader by Viliame Gavoka in a leadership contest. Rabuka resigned from parliament in 2020, citing that he would no longer be an obstacle to the bipartisan approach to be taken by the leaders of Fiji to create harmony and progress, and unity in Fiji. He formed a new political party in 2020, named Peoples Alliance, to contest the 2022 election.

== Early life ==

The son of Kolinio Epeli Vanuacicila Rabuka and Salote Lomaloma Rabuka, Rabuka was raised in the village of Drekeniwai in eastern Viti Levu, Fiji&#x27;s largest island. He was educated at Queen Victoria School, where he became the head boy in his final year. He represented Fiji in shot put, hammer throw, discus and the decathlon at the 1974 British Commonwealth Games and has also represented Fiji national rugby union team in the 1970&#x27;s.

== Military career ==

Rabuka was trained initially in New Zealand army schools, from which he graduated in 1973, and completed a professional development course at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He did postgraduate work at the Indian Defence Services Staff College in 1979, and at the Australian Joint Services Staff College in 1982. He was a senior operation plans manager for UNIFIL peacekeeping troops in Lebanon in 1980 and 1981. On his return home, he was appointed Army Chief of Staff. From 1982 to 1987, he was an operations and training officer for the Fijian army, except for a two-year absence (1983–1985) when he commanded the Fijian Battalion as part of the Multinational Force and Observers peacekeeping force in the Sinai.

For his service in Lebanon, Rabuka was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1980, and was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1981 Birthday Honours List.

=== 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état ===

Rabuka, by now a colonel, emerged suddenly from obscurity on 14 May 1987 when he staged the first of two military coups to reassert ethnic Fijian supremacy, following the 1987 election, which had brought an Indo-Fijian (ethnic Indian)-dominated government to power. Deposing the elected government, he handed power over to the governor-general, Penaia Ganilau, a high chief whom he expected to implement ethnic Fijian interests. When, however, Ganilau attempted to reinstate the abrogated constitution, Rabuka carried out a second coup on 28 September that year. At first he pledged his allegiance to the Queen, but on 7 October he issued a decree (Declaration – Republic of Fiji Decree 1987 No. 8) proclaiming a republic, abolishing the 113-year link to the British Monarchy. He handed over power on 5 December to an interim administration, headed by Ganilau as President and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara as Prime Minister, but remained Commander of the Army and Minister of Home Affairs, the National Youth Service, and the Auxiliary Army Service. Ganilau and Mara did not feel strong enough to dismiss Rabuka, but the public support they enjoyed as high chiefs was such that he did not feel strong enough to depose them. An uneasy truce existed between Ganilau and Mara on the one hand and Rabuka on the other.

Rabuka was seen as a hero by the Indigenous members when he overthrew Fiji&#x27;s first Indian government to install an indigenous Fijian ruling class. During the time of the coup, Rabuka was sometimes referred to in the press as &quot;Colonel Steve Rambo.&quot;

In 2006, Rabuka finally apologised for having executed the coups. Fiji Live reported on 28 March that Rabuka had told India&#x27;s Ahmedabad Newsline, while visiting India for medical treatment, that he regretted his role in the coups, which he described as &quot;democratically wrong&quot;.

== Political career ==

=== Prime Minister of Fiji (1992–1999) ===
In April 1991 Rabuka resigned as commander of the armed forces in order join the cabinet of Kamisese Mara as one of the Deputy Prime Ministers. Following the adoption in 1990 of a new constitution that guaranteed ethnic Fijian domination of the political system, Rabuka was chosen to lead the newly formed Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei in 1991. This party won the parliamentary election of 1992 and Rabuka became Prime Minister. His government was weakened from the outset, however, by a leadership challenge by former Finance Minister Josefata Kamikamica. In 1994, Kamikamica left the party with five of his supporters, depriving Rabuka of a parliamentary majority. A parliamentary election to resolve the impasse was held three years early; the Fijian Political Party won a plurality but fell two seats short of an absolute majority in the 70-member House of Representatives. Rabuka formed a coalition with the small General Voters Party, a small party supported almost entirely by general electors, who comprised Europeans, Chinese, and other minorities. He also agreed to negotiate with moderate leaders of the Indo-Fijian community to draft a controversial new Constitution, which removed most of the provisions that had biased the political system in favour of indigenous Fijians.

The elections of 1999 were the first in many years to see real competition between ethnic Fijians and Indo-Fijians for power. Rabuka lost these elections, and was replaced by Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister.

=== 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état ===
Following his electoral defeat, Rabuka was elected Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs. He was forced to relinquish this post in 2001, however, in the wake of allegations made against him by former President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara of complicity in the Fiji coup of 2000, which deposed both Mara and the Indo-Fijian Prime Minister, Mahendra Chaudhry, on 19 May 2000. Claiming that the coup leader George Speight – who was then in custody and was later convicted of treason – was only a front, Mara appeared on the &quot;Close-Up&quot; television program on 30 April 2001 and revealed that on 21 May 2000, two days after the coup, he had confronted Rabuka and Isikia Savua, the police chief, about their possible involvement in it. &quot;I could see it in their faces,&quot; Mara declared. Ratu Mara told the programme that within half an hour of Speight&#x27;s forcible occupation of the Parliament, Rabuka had telephoned Government House (the official residence of the President) to offer to form a government. He further alleged that the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit of the Army had been involved in the coup after receiving training on a farm owned by Rabuka.

In an interview with Fiji&#x27;s Daily Post on 2 July 2001, Rabuka angrily denied the allegations, saying that they were the ravings of &quot;an angry old man&quot; and &quot;very unbecoming of a national leader and of a statesman.&quot; The charges, however, were repeated on the floor of the Senate on 23 October 2004 by Adi Koila Nailatikau, Mara&#x27;s daughter.

Former Attorney-General Sir Vijay Singh published a memoir in 2006, supporting the allegations against Rabuka. Fiji Village quoted Singh on 18 August 2006 as saying, at the launch of his memoir, &quot;Speaking Out&quot;, that Rabuka had told him personally that he was one of the ring-leaders and that real target of the coup was not the Chaudhry government, but Ratu Mara, and that Mara had voiced his own suspicions about Rabuka to Singh. &quot;On Monday (following the Friday coup) I had a telephone conversation with the President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. He had no doubts that it was Mr Sitiveni Rabuka and Mr Isikia Savua&quot;, the then Commissioner of Police &quot;who had organised the miserable affair at parliamentary complex,&quot; Singh said. Rabuka refused to comment on Singh&#x27;s allegations, citing sub judice.

=== Alleged role in 2000 mutiny ===
Rabuka was also accused of instigating or supporting the mutiny that took place at Suva&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Barracks on 2 November 2000. In an interview with the &quot;Fiji Times&quot; on 12 November 2000, the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama charged that while the revolt was in progress, Rabuka had visited the barracks with his army uniform in the car, ready to take over command of the army. He also allegedly started issuing orders to soldiers. &quot;Rabuka&#x27;s words to one of my colonels at the height of the shootings raised my suspicions,&quot; Bainimarama said. &quot;He said the Colonel should listen to his instructions. He also criticised my leadership.&quot; Bainimarama accused Rabuka of leading soldiers astray by using &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;deceiving&quot; words.

Bainimarama also accused Rabuka of having &quot;politicised&quot; the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) unit, which he (Rabuka) had founded as a bodyguard in 1987, to favour both the mutiny and the earlier takeover of parliament in May. Members of the CRW were involved in both the May coup and the November mutiny.

Bainimarama&#x27;s version was supported by Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula, who led the counteroffensive to put down the mutiny. On 13 November 2000, he said that rebels interrogated by the military had implicated Rabuka. He accused Rabuka of trying to take civilians into the barracks to act as human shields for the mutineers, and stated that Rabuka&#x27;s intention was to &quot;claim military leadership and ultimately overthrow the Government of the day.&quot;

Rabuka, a retired officer, denied supporting the mutiny, but refused to comment on an accusation from Bainimarama that he had called a meeting of senior officers loyal to him to depose Bainimarama.

=== 2006 arrest ===

Rabuka&#x27;s denials of the allegations against him did not end the controversy. On 14 May 2005, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported in its &quot;Weekend Herald&quot; edition that the Fiji police force was close to making a decision on whether to charge certain unnamed individuals, one of whom the &quot;Herald&quot; believed to be Rabuka. The report quoted Police Commissioner Andrew Hughes as saying that a major hindrance to their investigation was a &quot;cone of silence&quot; among the close associates of the suspects.

Rabuka was arrested on 11 May 2006 on charges of inciting Lieutenant Colonel Viliame Seruvakula to commit a military mutiny on 2 November 2000, in the aftermath of the 2000 coup. He was alleged to have approached Seruvakula back on 4 July that year, with a view to overthrowing the Military Commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama. He entered no plea, was released on $F 1000 bail, and was required to surrender his passport. He was ordered to report to the Namadi police station between 6 am and 6 pm every Monday and Saturday, and was warned not to try to influence any witnesses, according to a Fiji Live report. It was announced on 17 June that at the request of the Director of Prosecutions, the case had been transferred to the High Court due to the serious nature of the charge.

Rabuka appeared in the High Court on 30 June and pleaded not guilty, &quot;Fiji Village&quot; reported. The trial was set for 20 October, but this was later changed to 6 November.

&quot;Fiji Village&quot; reported on 6 September that Rabuka had been refused permission to travel to Papua New Guinea for a golf tournament. Judge Gerard Winter ruled that the charges against Rabuka were serious and that he must not be allowed to abscond. Permission to leave Fiji would therefore be granted for medical emergencies only; the golf tournament did not qualify, he declared.

On 11 December 2006, Rabuka was found not guilty on two counts of inciting a mutiny. The judge cast a deciding vote after the panel of assessors was split.

=== 2006 parliamentary election ===

In early 2005, Rabuka ruled himself out of contesting the 2006 parliamentary election, but on 7 May said he was reconsidering, following appeals from Fijian businessmen and former politicians to be part of a move to unite all ethnically Fijian parties in a joint ticket to contest the next election. &quot;I am genuinely interested because I have always been for Fijian unity,&quot; he said. He has stressed that he believes that political unity among indigenous Fijians is essential to prevent the election of an Indo-Fijian dominated government in 2006. He admitted, however, that he was seen as &quot;a stumbling block&quot; by many, but added, &quot;I want to change all that.&quot; On 29 May, he said that political unity among the Fijian people should not be looked at half-heartedly as a possibility but wholeheartedly as a need. He accused Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, who has also called for unity among ethnic Fijians, of hypocrisy, saying that in the 1990s there was only one mainstream Fijian party, but that others had split from it and founded numerous competing groups. Qarase and his Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) were implied to be among those responsible for the disunity.

On 21 August, Rabuka said he was of the opinion that Prime Ministers defeated at the polls should not stand again. Former Prime Ministers remaining politically active led to instability, he said, pointing to recent political upheavals in Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands as examples. &quot;It is healthy for party leaders who become prime ministers after being defeated at general elections to take the responsibility for the defeat and bow out of active politics and just become an adviser or remain as a party supporter but not in the front seat running for another election.&quot;

On 19 October, Rabuka said that the current parliamentary team representing Cakaudrove enjoyed his full support. He said he would follow the will of the people, however, in deciding whether or not to contest the 2006 elections. Current members of Parliament from Cakaudrove include Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, the paramount chief of the Tovata Confederacy, Manasa Tugia, and Niko Nawaikula.

Despite his role in the formation (30 July 2005) of the Grand Coalition for Fiji, an electoral pact of five political parties supported mostly by indigenous Fijians, to contest the 2006 elections, Rabuka expressed doubts about its workability on 27 December. Public feuding threatened to derail the project, he warned. The recent attack on the 1997 Constitution by Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party leader Iliesa Duvuloco had upset him, he said.

At the same time, Rabuka said that another coup would be unlikely and that given the disunity among indigenous Fijians, attitudes towards a non-indigenous Prime Minister would not matter. The multi-party Cabinet provisions of the Constitution could not be implemented if either the SDL or the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) won the election, he said; if the two parties found the provision unworkable, they should have amended the Constitution and had had five years in which to do so.

On 7 February 2006, Rabuka said that he was still considering whether to contest the forthcoming elections. He thought it &quot;unwise&quot;, without elaborating, to contest seats in his native Cakaudrove, or those held by members of the Grand Coalition, and might contest only if an urban open constituency was available. He considered, however, that given his length of time out of politics, making a comeback would be difficult. He also called for all political parties to be, and be seen to be, representing all ethnic groups. Otherwise, the racial faultline in Fijian politics would not be overcome, he said.

In the end, Rabuka decided not to contest the election, and his party fielded only one candidate.

=== 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état ===

The Fiji Times reported on 15 December 2006 that Rabuka stated that he saw no possibility that Laisenia Qarase, deposed as Prime Minister in a 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état on 5 December, would return to power. He denied supporting the coup, but said that Qarase, along with deposed President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, were weak leaders who had done nothing to forestall the coup by negotiating with the Military while there was still time. Qarase should have seen the coup coming, Rabuka said.

Following the coup, he criticised Bainimarama&#x27;s refusal to hold elections, saying it was because Bainimarama wanted to &quot;[keep] away from the role of governing, people and groups he has pre-determined should not govern.&quot;

=== 2014 parliamentary election ===

Rabuka mostly kept a low profile after the 2006 coup. In June 2013 however, he came out and said that he would consider running in the proposed 2014 national elections, if they went ahead. He sought the leadership of the newly formed Social Democratic Liberal Party (SoDelPa), the successor party to former Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s &quot;Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua&quot; (SDL), which the Military-backed interim government had dissolved, but was rebuffed after he said that he had no regrets about the 1987 coups. &quot;I had to do what I had to do in 1987,&quot; he told the Fiji Sun on 30 January 2014. A subsequent bid for the deputy leadership of the party also ran into stiff opposition. He also sought nomination as a parliamentary candidate, but on 24 August, SoDelPa announced that it had decided not to nominate him. Despite this, he is still a member and supporter of the party.

=== Leader of the Opposition and 2018 parliamentary election ===
In June 2016, Ro Teimumu Kepa announced that she was standing down as leader of SODELPA. She was replaced by Sitiveni Rabuka. Rabuka led the party into the 2018 elections.On 25 May 2018, Rabuka was charged by anti-corruption agency Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption in relation to the declaration of his assets and liabilities as required under the Political Parties Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures Act. He was tried during the election campaign and acquitted. An appeal by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption, which could have resulted in Rabuka&#x27;s disqualification two days from the poll, was dismissed, with FICAC ordered to pay costs. Shortly before the appeal was decided Rabuka was again called in by police on unspecified charges.

Rabuka won 77,040 votes in the election, gaining a seat in parliament. In a post-election interview, he said that it was unfortunate that the leaders of the two main parties were coup-leaders and that there needed to be &quot;a move away from coup profiled people&quot;.

On 26 May 2020, Sodelpa had been suspended for the breach of the Political Parties Act for 60 days effective immediately. All appointees have been declared null and void, and now have 60 days to rectify all issues or face deregistration. Thus, Rabuka can not represent himself as the leader of Sodelpa after the registrar declared the party suspension. On 29 June 2020, Sodelpa suspension was lifted.

=== 2020 SODELPA leadership contest ===

On 27 November 2020, Rabuka was ousted as SODELPA leader in a leadership contest. There was speculation that Rabuka would form a new party after his ousting as leader, however he later denied that he would form a new party and would continue to support SODELPA. Gavoka was formally recognised as SODELPA leader on 28 November during the party&#x27;s AGM meeting. Prominent lawyer Filimoni Vosarogo was chosen as the new Deputy Leader. 21 members of the SODELPA Management Board voted for Gavoka while 20 members voted for Rabuka. The party&#x27;s caucus was said to be evenly divided over whether the leadership change was the correct course of action.

On 7 December, Rabuka resigned from Parliament and his position as Opposition Leader of Parliament. He made the announcement while responding to the opening of the 2020–2021 Parliament Session by President Jioji Konrote.

On 25 July 2021, he was arrested by Fijian police after criticising government moves to amend land legislation.

=== Prime Minister of Fiji (2022–present) ===
Rabuka formed a new political party in 2021, named the People&#x27;s Alliance (PA), to contest the 2022 election. The People&#x27;s Alliance became the second largest party following the 2022 election, and managed to successfully oust Frank Bainimarama after 16 years of rule, forming a coalition government with SODELPA and the National Federation Party (NFP). Rabuka subsequently became the prime minister-designate. He had been summoned to the police station after questioning the results and calling for a military intervention, despite observers calling the election free and fair. After the NFP-PA coalition formed a government with SODELPA, Rabuka was sworn in as prime minister on 24 December. As part of the coalition agreement, three deputy prime ministers assumed office, NFP leader Biman Prasad, SODELPA leader Viliame Gavoka and Manoa Kamikamica. Rabuka&#x27;s other ministerial portfolios included information and public enterprises, civil service, foreign affairs and climate change.

On 26 December 2022, Rabuka approved the return of USP Vice-Chancellor Pal Ahluwalia and Padma Lal, wife of the late Professor Brij Lal who were expelled from Fiji by Bainimarama&#x27;s government.

On 20 January 2023, Rabuka travelled to Kiribati for his first official state visit where he met President Taneti Maamau. The meeting centred on enhancing diplomatic ties and fostering unity within the Blue Pacific region. Previously, Kiribati withdrew from the Pacific Islands Forum in July 2022.

In January 2025, Rabuka said that he would disclose the names of individuals behind the 1987 coups before the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

==Manager of the Pacific Islanders rugby union team==

In October 2008, it was reported that Rabuka would be the manager of the Pacific Islanders rugby union team during its tour of Europe.

==Personal life==
Rabuka is Christian. He married Suluweti Tuiloma at RFMF officers mess in Nabua on 10 April 1975. In 2000, he publicly admitted that he had been unfaithful to her, both before and after their marriage, and that he had fathered three children by two different women whilst engaged to Suluweti.

<text>Triple Play is a series of video games based on Major League Baseball, published by EA Sports until their replacement by the &quot;MVP Baseball&quot; in 2003.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that other simulations (for example, Sega&#x27;s version) were superior to &quot;Triple Play&quot;, while &quot;GamePro&quot; greeted it as &quot;the best baseball simulation so far&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors named &quot;Triple Play Gold Edition&quot; a runner-up for Genesis Game of the Year (behind &quot;Vectorman 2&quot;).

==Games==
All of the games contained the rosters and schedules of the beginning of the season of the year before the one described in the name except for &quot;Triple Play 2002&quot;. For example, &quot;Triple Play 2001&quot; contained the rosters and schedules of the 2000 season, and &quot;Triple Play Baseball&quot; (without a year) contained the rosters and schedules for 2001. This is a result of the tradition of listing the year the series ends in, basketball, football and hockey ending in a different year from when they started. Baseball is the only exception, as it begins in March and ends in October of the same year.

The games were produced primarily for the PlayStation console, but also saw release on the PC and the Game Boy Color.

<text>William Edgar Thornton (April 14, 1929 – January 11, 2021) was an American NASA astronaut. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from University of North Carolina and a doctorate in medicine, also from UNC. He flew on &quot;Challenger&quot; twice, the STS-8 and STS-51-B missions.

==Early life and education==
William Edgar Thornton was born on April 14, 1929. He attended primary and secondary schools in Faison, North Carolina. He received a bachelor of science degree in physics from the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 1952. In 1963, he received a doctorate in medicine from UNC.

==Experience==
Following graduation from the University of North Carolina and having completed Air Force ROTC training, Thornton served as officer-in-charge of the Instrumentation Lab at the Flight Test Air Proving Ground. He later became a consultant to Air Proving Ground Command.

As chief engineer of the electronics division of the Del Mar Engineering Labs at Los Angeles from 1956 to 1959, he also organized and directed its Avionics Division. He returned to the University of North Carolina Medical School in 1959, graduated in 1963, and completed internship training in 1964 at the Wilford Hall USAF Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.

Thornton returned to active duty with the United States Air Force and was then assigned to the USAF Aerospace Medical Division, Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, where he completed the Primary Flight Surgeon&#x27;s training in 1964. It was during his two-year tour of duty there that he became involved in space medicine research and subsequently applied and was selected for astronaut training. Dr. Thornton developed and designed the first mass measuring devices for space, which remain in use today.

Thornton has logged over 2,500 hours pilot flying time in jet aircraft.

==NASA experience==
Thornton was selected as a scientist-astronaut in August 1967 with NASA Astronaut Group 6. He completed the required flight training at Reese Air Force Base, Texas. Thornton was physician crew member on the highly successful Skylab Medical Experiments Altitude Test (SMEAT)—a 56-day simulation of a Skylab mission enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data and evaluate equipment, operations, and procedures. Thornton was also the mission specialist on SMD III, a simulation of a Spacelab life sciences mission.

Thornton was a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, 3, and 4 missions, and principal investigator for Skylab experiments on mass measurement, anthropometric measurements, hemodynamics, and human fluid shifts and physical conditioning. He first documented the shift and loss of fluid changes in body posture size and shape, including increase in height and the rapid loss of muscle strength and mass in space flight.

As a member of the Astronaut Office Operations Missions Development group, Thornton was responsible for developing crew procedures and techniques for deployable payloads, and for maintenance of crew conditions in flight. He developed advanced techniques for, and made studies in, kinesiology and kinesimetry related to space operations.

During Space Shuttle operations he continued physiological investigations in the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal and neurological areas. He developed the Shuttle treadmill for in-flight exercise and several other on-board devices. He was long an advocate for exercise as a countermeasure for conditions such as bone loss in space. His work concentrated on the space adaptation syndrome, with relevant investigations on STS-4, STS-5, STS-6, STS-7, and STS-8.

Thornton holds more than 60 patents that range from military weapons systems through the first real-time EKG computer analysis. Space-related items include the first in-flight mass measurement devices, shock and vibration isolation systems, an improved waste collection system, an improved lower body negative pressure (LBNP) apparatus, and others.

Thornton continued his work in space medicine while awaiting his next flight opportunity. He worked on problems relative to extending mission durations in the Space Shuttle, in the Space station, and in space exploration, and has designed the necessary exercise and other hardware to support such missions. He continued analysis and publication of results from studies of neurological adaptation, and the study of neuromuscular inhibition following flight, osteoporosis in space and on Earth, and post-flight orthostatic hypotension. He has completed designs for exercise and other countermeasure equipment for the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO), and for Space Station Freedom, including improved treadmills, rowing machines, isotonic exercise devices, and a bicycle. Much of this is currently scheduled for flight.

==Spaceflight experience==
===STS-8===
STS-8 &quot;Challenger&quot; (August 30 to September 5, 1983). This was the third flight for the Challenger and the first mission with a night launch from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Thornton, participating as a scientist-astronaut, was one of five crew members. During the flight Thornton made almost continuous measurements and investigations of adaptation of the human body to weightlessness, especially of the nervous system and of the space adaptation syndrome. This was a continuation of his previous work in these areas. Much of the equipment used was designed and developed by Thornton. The mission was accomplished in 98 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.2 million miles in 145 hours, 8 minutes, 4 seconds. He became the oldest person to fly in space.

===STS-51B===
STS-51B/Spacelab-3 &quot;Challenger&quot; (April 29 to May 6, 1985). The Spacelab-3 science mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned for a night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 7-day flight, Thornton was responsible for the first animal payload on a shuttle mission and other medical investigations. The mission was accomplished in 110 orbits of the Earth, traveling 2.9 million miles (4.7 million km) in 169 hours and 39 minutes.

At the conclusion of the STS-51B flight, Thornton had logged over 313 hours in space across his two missions.

<text>A filter fluorometer is a type of fluorometer that may be employed in fluorescence spectroscopy.

In the fluorometer, a light source emits light of an excitation wavelength that is relevant to the compound to be measured. Filter fluorometers produce specific excitation and emission wavelengths by using optical filters. The filter blocks other wavelengths but transmits wavelengths relevant to the compound. The light passes through the sample to be measured, and a certain wavelength is absorbed while a longer wavelength is emitted. The emitted light is measured by a detector. By changing the optical filter, different substances can be measured.

== Applications ==
Filter fluorometers can be highly sensitive, so are well suited to precise scientific research. The optical filters are relatively inexpensive and are easy to change, so filter fluorometers are commonly used in experimental applications which repeatedly measure different compounds.

==Filters==
There are two filters for the fluorometer:
#The &quot;primary filter&quot; or &quot;excitation filter&quot; or &quot;incident light filter&quot; isolates the wavelength that will cause the compound to fluoresce (the light).
#The secondary filter isolates the desired emitted light (fluorescent light).

===Choosing the correct filters===
The proper selection of filters requires familiarity with the emission spectrum and the excitation spectrum. The primary filter is selected to transmit only the wavelengths from the emission spectrum and excitation spectrum that overlap.

<text>The Blackburn Roc (company designation B-25) was a naval fighter aircraft designed and produced by the British aviation company Blackburn Aircraft. It took its name from the mythical bird of the tales of the Arabian Nights, the Roc. It was operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) and was active during the Second World War.

The Roc was designed to Air Ministry Specification O.30/35 and was derived from the Blackburn Skua dive-bomber/fighter and developed in parallel to it. Unlike the Skua, the Roc had its armament in a turret. A large proportion of the work was subcontracted to another aircraft manufacturer, Boulton Paul, which had also designed their own turret fighter, the Boulton Paul Defiant. On 23 December 1938, the prototype Roc performed its maiden flight. Testing soon revealed it to have a relatively low maximum speed of only . The float plane version of the Roc was even slower, leading to the cancellation of plans to equip float plane squadrons with the type. Cancellation of the project was discussed but this move was dismissed largely due to the wider impact on aircraft production.

During April 1939, the conventional version of the Roc was brought into FAA service. The type was present during the Allied campaign in Norway, as well as Operation Dynamo and Operation Aerial, the evacuations of Allied forces from Dunkirk and other French ports. The Roc quickly came to be viewed as inferior to existing aircraft, such as the Skua and the type had only a limited career in front-line service. The Roc&#x27;s sole confirmed aerial victory occurred on 28 May 1940, when a patrolling Roc of 806 Naval Air Squadron, flown by pilot Midshipman A. G. Day, shot down a Junkers Ju 88 bomber from below. Towards the end of 1940, the Roc was largely relegated to air sea rescue and target-towing duties. Only sporadic engagements occurred after this point, with no substantial accomplishments occurring. The Roc was withdrawn during 1943.

==Design and development==
===Background===
On 31 December 1935, the Air Ministry issued Specification O.30/35, which sought a carrier-based turret-armed fighter for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). The Blackburn Aircraft design team was headed by G. E. Petty. It was decided to pursue a derivative of its new Skua dive bomber, of which two prototypes had been ordered for the Fleet Air Arm earlier that year. There were several substantial differences, not least that the Skua did not use a turret; the fuselage was widened around the mid-section to accommodate it.

The rival aircraft manufacturer Boulton Paul proposed the &quot;P.85&quot;, a redesigned version of its land-based P.82 turret fighter (for Specification F.9/35, which would enter service as the &quot;Defiant&quot;), alternatively powered by a Bristol Hercules radial engine or a Rolls-Royce Merlin inline engine. Although the &quot;Sea Defiant&quot; was expected to be faster, the Air Ministry decided to select Blackburn&#x27;s proposal instead.

Similar to the Skua, the &quot;B-25 Roc&quot; was a two-seat low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction. It was fitted with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage and its wings could be folded for storage aboard aircraft carriers. Attachment points for a float undercarriage were present as standard, unlike on the Skua. The Roc also retained the wing-mounted dive brakes present on the Skua but the mainplane was redesigned with a slight dihedral to obviate the upturned wingtips. It was powered by a Bristol Perseus radial engine that drove a three-bladed propeller. Amongst other things, the rear fuselage housed marine equipment, including a collapsible dinghy.

The Roc&#x27;s primary armament was the same Boulton Paul Type A power-operated gun turret as used on the Defiant, with four  Browning machine guns. The turret could rotate in any direction and the guns elevated as high as 85 degrees above the horizon; this movement was achieved via a control column. The turret was hydraulically powered by an electrically-driven pump, the guns were fired electrically and had integrated automatic interruption to prevent the tail unit or propeller being hit. Additional armaments included two bombs and eight practice bombs, carried upon bomb racks under each wing; provisions for a close-fitting 70-gallon external fuel tank were also present on the underside of the central fuselage.

On 28 April 1937, the Air Ministry placed an &quot;off the drawing board&quot; order for 136 Rocs. As Blackburn already had full order books for the Skua and the Botha torpedo bomber, it was decided to sub-contract the detailed design and production of the aircraft to Boulton Paul at Wolverhampton; this arrangement has been attributed for the delayed delivery of the company&#x27;s own turret aircraft, the Defiant.

===Into flight===
On 23 December 1938, the prototype Roc performed its maiden flight in the hands of Blackburn test pilot H. J. Wilson. Contractor&#x27;s trials were conducted at Brough after which, during March 1939, the aircraft was delivered to Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Martlesham Heath for handling and armaments trials. Early modifications, such as alternative de Havilland-supplied propellers, were also evaluated. Early flight testing revealed its handling to be not only acceptable but superior to that of the Skua; while not suitable for aerobatic manoeuvres, it demonstrated its steadiness in steep dives. The aircraft also demonstrated poor performance in some areas, particularly that its maximum speed was only .
By this point, some officials had already recognised that the Roc&#x27;s performance would be inadequate; during October 1938, the Fifth Sea Lord (the Chief of Naval Air Services) Alexander Ramsay issued his recommendation that the development of the Roc be abandoned. Production was allowed to continue as the project&#x27;s cancellation would have caused too much disruption for Boulton Paul; plans were laid to adapt the aircraft to perform target towing and other secondary duties.

As well as its primary role as a carrier-based fighter, the Roc was also required to be capable of operating as a floatplane. A conversion kit was designed that allowed for a set of floats from a Blackburn Shark to be fitted. These floats, which was largely composed of Alclad, were fitted with pneumatically-actuated water rudders that connected directly with the aircraft&#x27;s conventional braking system; the tail wheel was also replaced by a mooring ring.

During testing, the first conversion demonstrated direction instability and during December 1939, it crashed at Helensburgh Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment where it had been transferred at the outbreak of the war. Testing continued using the other conversion, with particular effort paid to addressing its instability. While the addition of an enlarged ventral fin largely resolved the problem, the effect of the floats on the aircraft&#x27;s performance was too great to be ignored, as the maximum speed had fallen to only , thus plans to form a fighter squadron equipped with Roc floatplanes were abandoned. During 1942, the Roc floatplane was again evaluated to determine whether the aircraft could be useful as a target tug for the fleet, replacing Blackburn Shark floatplane target tugs. The Roc floatplane was rejected in this role as well, resulting in the fleet&#x27;s requirements for target tugs being fulfilled by landplanes, such as the Miles Martinet, instead. By August 1940, production of the Roc had ceased and manufacturing resources were diverted to more capable aircraft such as the Fairey Fulmar and the Hawker Sea Hurricane.

==Operational history==

During April 1939, preparations commenced for the Roc&#x27;s entry into squadron service; that same month, the fifth production aircraft was delivered to the Central Flying School to assist with personnel familiarisation. Later that year, deliveries of the Roc commenced to the Skua-equipped 800 and 803 Naval Air Squadrons, with three or four Rocs supplementing the Skuas. When 803 Squadron relocated to RAF Wick in northern Scotland to provide fighter cover for the Royal Naval base at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, the Rocs proved ineffective; they were described by the squadron&#x27;s commanding officer as a &quot;constant hindrance&quot;, who requested that the type be replaced by additional Skuas.

During the Allied campaign in Norway, a small contingent of Rocs travelled with 800 and 801 Naval Air Squadrons aboard (By this point, 803 Squadron had abandoned its Rocs to become an all-Skua squadron). In the Norwegian theatre, they were used to carry out combat air patrols over the fleet, but were regarded as being of little use, showing inadequate performance when intercepting German aircraft.

Both Skuas and Rocs operated over the English Channel in the summer of 1940 in Operation Dynamo and Operation Aerial, the evacuations of Allied forces from Dunkirk and other French ports. What is believed to be the Roc&#x27;s sole confirmed aerial victory occurred on 28 May 1940, when a patrolling Roc of 806 Naval Air Squadron, flown by pilot Midshipman A. G. Day, alongside two Skuas, intercepted five Junkers Ju 88s which were attacking a convoy off Ostend in Belgium. Flying underneath the Junkers while the Skuas attacked from above, Day&#x27;s Roc destroyed one Ju 88 before returning safely to RAF Detling. On 12 June, Rocs and Skuas of 801 Naval Air Squadron strafed and dive-bombed German E-boats in Boulogne harbour, damaging several E-boats. On 20 June, Skuas and Rocs were used to bomb gun emplacements at Cap Gris Nez.

The Roc was relegated to air sea rescue and target-towing duties at various locations. The majority of aircraft were dispatched from the production line to second-line squadrons. No. 2 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit at Gosport received 16 Rocs to replace its Blackburn Sharks during June 1940. The type was commonly deployed for air-sea rescue patrols, searching for the survivors of sunken ships and downed aircraft in the Channel.

On 26 September 1940, during one such patrol, Pilot Officer D. H. Clarke and his gunner, Sergeant Hunt, engaged a Heinkel He 59 seaplane, also on a rescue mission, which had fired on them first. The two aircraft exchanged fire until they reached the coast of France where the Heinkel escaped in a damaged condition. Some Rocs were dispatched to distant locations such as Bermuda, however, the last pair of operational aircraft were withdrawn from service during June 1943. The last four Rocs stationed at HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot; in Gosport survived until late 1944, all unairworthy, with their turrets still being used for anti-aircraft defence.

<doc id="516593" wikidata="Q5358172" url="?curid=516593" title="Electron excitation">
<text>Electron excitation is the transfer of a bound electron to a more energetic, but still bound state. This can be done by photoexcitation (PE), where the electron absorbs a photon and gains all its energy or by collisional excitation (CE), where the electron receives energy from a collision with another, energetic electron. Within a semiconductor crystal lattice, thermal excitation is a process where lattice vibrations provide enough energy to transfer electrons to a higher energy band such as a more energetic sublevel or energy level. When an excited electron falls back to a state of lower energy, it undergoes electron relaxation (deexcitation). This is accompanied by the emission of a photon (radiative relaxation/spontaneous emission) or by a transfer of energy to another particle. The energy released is equal to the difference in energy levels between the electron energy states.

Excited states in nuclear, atomic, and molecule systems have distinct energy values, allowing external energy to be absorbed in the appropriate proportions.

In general, the excitation of electrons in atoms strongly varies from excitation in solids, due to the different nature of the electronic levels and the structural properties of some solids. The electronic excitation (or deexcitation) can take place by several processes such as:
* collision with more energetic electrons (Auger recombination, impact ionization, ...)
* absorption / emission of a photon,
* absorption of several photons (so called multiphoton ionization); e.g., quasi-monochromatic laser light.
There are several rules that dictate the transition of an electron to an excited state, known as selection rules. First, as previously noted, the electron must absorb an amount of energy equivalent to the energy difference between the electron&#x27;s current energy level and an unoccupied, higher energy level in order to be promoted to that energy level. The next rule follows from the Frank-Condon Principle, which states that the absorption of a photon by an electron and the subsequent jump in energy levels is near-instantaneous. The atomic nucleus with which the electron is associated cannot adjust to the change in electron position on the same time scale as the electron (because nuclei are much heavier), and thus the nucleus may be brought into a vibrational state in response to the electron transition. Then, the rule is that the amount of energy absorbed by an electron may allow for the electron to be promoted from a vibrational and electronic ground state to a vibrational and electronic excited state. A third rule is the Laporte Rule, which necessitates that the two energy states between which an electron transitions must have different symmetry. A fourth rule is that when an electron undergoes a transition, the spin state of the molecule/atom that contains the electron must be conserved.

Under some circumstances, certain selection rules may be broken and excited electrons may make &quot;forbidden&quot; transitions. The spectral lines associated with such transitions are known as forbidden lines.

== Electron excitation in solids ==

=== Ground state preparation ===

The energy and momentum of electrons in solids can be described by introducing Bloch waves into the Schrödinger equation with applying periodic boundary conditions. Solving this eigenvalue equation, one obtains sets of solutions that are describing bands of energies that are allowed to the electrons: the electronic band structure. The latter page contains a summary of the techniques that are nowadays available for modeling the properties of solid crystals at equilibrium, i.e., when they are not illuminated by light.

=== Electron excitation by light: polariton ===

The behavior of electrons excited by photons can be described by the quasi-particle named &quot;polariton&quot;. A number of methods exist to describe these, both using classical and quantum electrodynamics. One of the methods is to use the concept of dressed particle.

<text>Frank Porter Graham (October 14, 1886 – February 16, 1972) was an American educator and political activist. A professor of history, he was elected President of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1930, and he later became the first President of the consolidated University of North Carolina system.

Graham was an active champion of many liberal causes including academic freedom, economic justice, civil rights, disarmament and world peace. He served on numerous advisory boards for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, and in 1949 he was appointed by the North Carolina governor to fill a vacant seat in the United States Senate. His effort to win election in the following year turned into a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful struggle with conservative Democrat Willis Smith.

In 1951 he was appointed as a United Nations mediator for the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan. He pursued that elusive goal for 16 years, and he continued his advocacy work on many other issues, until failing health forced him to retire from public life in 1967.

==Early life==
Frank Porter Graham was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1886, the sixth of nine children born to Alexander and Katherine Bryan Sloan Graham. His father was superintendent of the Charlotte school system for 25 years, and many of his siblings and other family relations were teachers. His older brother, Archibald Wright &quot;Moonlight&quot; Graham (December 28, 1879 – August 25, 1965), was a professional baseball player with the New York Giants and later a physician (and the inspiration for a character in the 1989 film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;). Alexander Graham Middle School in Charlotte is named for his father. It opened in 1920 on Morehead Street near the Grahams&#x27; home and is now in a newer building on Runnymede Lane.

Graham attended the original University of North Carolina (UNC, now called University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), from which he was graduated with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1909. He was an active and popular student, serving as the editor of the college newspaper and the yearbook, president of the debating society, president of the campus YMCA, Senior class president, and the university&#x27;s head cheerleader. He thereafter studied law and received his license in 1913. He received a graduate degree in 1916 from Columbia University. While he was studying law, Graham worked as a high school teacher in Raleigh, North Carolina. He went on to serve as a history instructor at UNC beginning in 1915. He interrupted his teaching career to enlist in 1917 in the United States Marine Corps for service in World War I. Enlisted as a private, he was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1919.

Graham returned to the History department at UNC and was promoted to a professorship in 1927, despite not having earned a Ph.D. He also served briefly as dean of students.

==President of the University of North Carolina==
In June 1930, Graham was elected President of UNC, succeeding Harry Woodburn Chase. As &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it: &quot;He was literally &#x27;drafted&#x27; for the presidency, for he desired to teach, and yielded only to the unanimous vote of the trustees.&quot; His formal induction ceremony on November 11, 1931 drew such a large crowd that it had to be held in Kenan Stadium. Graham used the date of Armistice Day to underscore his message that schools and universities have the responsibility of guiding young people away from war. His first cousin Edward Kidder Graham had been President of UNC from 1913 to 1918.

In July of the following year, he married Marian Drane of Baltimore, Maryland. Their wedding ceremony was performed by the bride&#x27;s father, who was the rector of Baltimore&#x27;s historic St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church for more than 50 years.

Just months after his marriage, in November 1932, Graham was chosen to lead the consolidation of the University of North Carolina system, which brought together the three public colleges for whites in the state: Graham&#x27;s UNC at Chapel Hill, the North Carolina College for Women (now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro), and State College (now North Carolina State University). He served as President of the university system for the next 17 years. He was an approachable, friendly, and popular president, known to all as &quot;Dr. Frank&quot;.

Graham was a member of the executive committee of the National Association of State Universities, and served as vice president of the Association of American Universities. He was also the first president of the Southern Council on International Relations, an organization founded in 1938 to promote international studies throughout public schools in the South.

Graham was an early advocate of reform in college athletics. In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation — a private organization that researches and recommends education policy — published &quot;American College Athletics&quot;, a report that accused many schools of using cash payments to recruit athletes, with no regard for academic performance. Partially in response to that report, in 1935 Graham worked with his colleagues at the National Association of State Universities to develop a plan—eventually known as the &quot;Graham Plan&quot;—that called for the elimination of preferential treatment for college athletes, and a general de-emphasis of football specifically. While not implemented nationally, the Graham Plan was passed by the Southern Conference (of which the University of North Carolina and North Carolina State were members) in February 1936. The plan was in direct contradiction to rules implemented by the Southeastern Conference at the same time that embraced athletic scholarships, making them transparent. The financial aid provisions of the Graham Plan were repealed by the Southern Conference in December 1937, after colleges complained that they were put at a disadvantage to other schools and were forcing students to lie about financial aid they received. The University of Virginia left the Southern Conference due to the Graham Plan, indicating that its students could not comply with the regulations without violating its honor code.

== Early government work ==
In 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Graham as chairman of his Advisory Council on Economic Security, which made proposals that led to the Social Security Act the following year. At the same time, Graham served as vice chairman of the consumers board of the National Recovery Administration.

He headed the Advisory Committee on Economic Conditions in the South which in 1938 drafted a report detailing the dire position of the region. Roosevelt issued the 15-chapter report, drawing public attention to what it deemed &quot;the nation&#x27;s number one economic problem&quot;. Immediately afterward, Graham helped establish the Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW), an advocacy group that organized poverty relief efforts and promoted New Deal policies. Its first meeting was held in Birmingham, Alabama in November 1938, drawing together progressives from all across the South in &quot;the most significant attempt by Southerners, up to that time, to introduce a far-reaching agenda of change&quot;.

During World War II, Graham served as a member of the National War Labor Board from 1942 to 1945. More than any other member, he pressed the Board to address the concerns of African Americans seeking fair wages and equal treatment in the workplace.

After Roosevelt&#x27;s death, new President Harry S. Truman continued to utilize Graham, and appointed him to the President&#x27;s Committee on Civil Rights in 1946. But in the following year, Graham was mentioned in hearings held by the House Committee Investigating Un-American Activities for his involvement with the SCHW, which was alleged to be a Communist front organization. Graham denied any Communist affiliation, but was tarnished by accusations of &quot;pinkish&quot; sympathies for years.

During this time, Graham became involved with United Nations diplomatic work. In October 1947, President Truman appointed him to the UN commission arbitrating peace in the Indonesian National Revolution, a thorny affair that seemed to hold little chance for mediation. Still, the appointment of Graham, together with foreign counterparts of equal gravitas, displayed a clear determination for the peace talks to succeed, a situation recognized in &quot;The New York Times&quot; which praised &quot;the high character of the Committee&quot;. Graham helped open direct negotiations between Indonesian and Dutch representatives at Batavia aboard USS &quot;Renville&quot; in December 1947. After his return, he was named adviser to the Secretary of State on Indonesian affairs.

==United States Senator==
North Carolina&#x27;s state agriculture commissioner W. Kerr Scott was elected Governor in November 1948. Like Graham, Scott was a pro-Truman Democrat who had supported the New Deal. Two months after Scott&#x27;s inauguration in January 1949, incumbent U.S. Senator J. Melville Broughton died in office. Broughton&#x27;s death left Scott with the responsibility of choosing a replacement. After three weeks of intense speculation throughout March as to whom the governor might choose, attention focused on individuals ranging from the senator&#x27;s widow, who expressed no interest; Scott&#x27;s former campaign manager, Capus Miller Waynick; another Scott supporter, Major Lennox Polk McLendon, a lawyer from Greensboro, North Carolina; former Senator Umstead; and the governor himself. Scott appointed Graham, which surprised many political observers.

At the time of his appointment, Graham had never sought nor served in any political office, an unusual phenomenon at the time for North Carolina senators. Also atypical was that the particular Senate seat Graham occupied was in a period of considerable turnover. Beginning with the death of Senator Josiah W. Bailey in 1946, and concluding with the election of B. Everett Jordan in 1958, no fewer than eight men served in the seat in a dozen years.

==1950 Democratic primary==

Graham faced two opponents in the 1950 Democratic primary, including former Senator Robert R. Reynolds and former Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives Willis Smith. Reynolds was eliminated with only 10% of the vote, while Smith and Graham received 41% and 49% respectively. Graham was one percentage point below the threshold of receiving the nomination outright, and Smith could have chosen to engage Graham in a runoff. Smith initially declined, but when activists rallied outside his house in a show of support, Smith changed his mind.

In the runoff, Smith ran as an anti-Truman Democrat. According to his staffers, Smith never said anything outright racist, but some of his supporters released unofficial pamphlets stirring up fears of an integrated society. Fueled by their intense dislike for the progressive Graham, conservatives turned the Smith campaign into an openly racist crusade.

At the time of the election, few African-Americans were voting in North Carolina because of Jim Crow laws designed to disenfranchise them. Those blacks who were registered were mostly Republicans who cast ballots only in routine general elections. Graham was hence unable to appeal to many black voters, and he did not call for immediate integration, either. Graham was not a natural campaigner and hesitated even to ask voters for their vote. His political views were different from most North Carolinians&#x27;.

In the virtually all-white Democratic primaries, the tactics of Smith&#x27;s campaign supporters (among whom was future Republican Senator Jesse Helms) worked along with these other factors, and Smith prevailed by a narrow 52%-48%.

==Post-Senate==

After his short Senate stint, Graham re-entered the field of global diplomacy. He returned to the United Nations as a mediator for India and Pakistan in the Kashmir dispute, serving in this capacity from 1951 through 1967. He retired from U.N. service in 1967 at the age of 81 and returned to Chapel Hill, after his wife died.

== Death and legacy ==

Graham died in Chapel Hill at the age of 85. He is interred at the Old Chapel Hill Cemetery.

UNC-Chapel Hill&#x27;s student union is named in Graham&#x27;s honor. The spacious, multilevel building houses various student services as well as an art gallery, eatery, film auditorium, radio station WXYC, and recreational facilities including twelve bowling lanes in the basement. The UNC-Chapel Hill Graduate School established a Frank Porter Graham Honor Society in 1993 to honor students and faculty who provide &quot;outstanding service&quot; to the university.

The Frank Porter Graham Child Development Institute, founded in 1966, is among the nation&#x27;s oldest and largest centers of public policy research regarding children and families. The Frank Porter Graham Elementary School in Chapel Hill and the Frank Porter Graham Building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro also honor the former senator.

Since 1968, the North Carolina chapter of the ACLU has acknowledged people who work towards the promotion of civil liberties in the state with the Frank Porter Graham Award. Graham&#x27;s life story was the subject of a 1994 documentary, &quot;Dr. Frank: The Life and Times of Frank Porter Graham&quot;, narrated by Charles Kuralt.

<doc id="516595" wikidata="Q1048921" url="?curid=516595" title="Nassau Coliseum">
<text>Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum (or simply the Nassau Coliseum) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Uniondale, Nassau County, New York, on Long Island. The venue is situated approximately east of the eastern limits of the borough of Queens in New York City, adjacent to the Meadowbrook Parkway. It is one of the larger public auditoriums in the New York metropolitan area.

Opened in 1972, the Coliseum occupies of Mitchel Field, a former Army airfield, later an Air Force base. The facility is located in the Town of Hempstead, within the Uniondale 11553 ZIP Code. The Coliseum is used for sporting events, concerts, large exhibitions, as well as trade shows— at the main arena, at the Expo Center. In 2015, the arena was closed for a major renovation which was completed in April 2017.

The New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL) played at the Coliseum from 1972 to 2015 before moving to Barclays Center in Brooklyn. After the move was commercially unsuccessful, the team split its home schedule between Barclays and the renovated Coliseum from 2018 to 2020 and played the home portion of their 2020–21 season at the Coliseum, before moving to the new UBS Arena at Belmont Park for the 2021–22 season, which is also on Hempstead Turnpike, west of the Coliseum.

It was also the home of the New York Nets (now known as the Brooklyn Nets) of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1972 to 1977 and the New York Riptide of the National Lacrosse League (NLL) from 2020 to 2024. In 2017, the venue became the new home of the Brooklyn Nets&#x27; NBA G League team, the Long Island Nets. Currently, the Nets serve as the building&#x27;s main tenant.

==Sports==
The Coliseum originally had a capacity of 13,000 to 15,000 depending on the event, and in the early 1980s the maximum capacity was increased to around 18,000. Before closing for renovations in 2015 the Coliseum seated 16,170 for hockey, up to 18,511 for concerts and 17,686 for boxing. Those renovations resulted in drastically reduced capacities: 13,917 for hockey and 14,500 for basketball.

===Hockey===
The New York Raiders, intended by the fledgling World Hockey Association to be their flagship franchise, were slated to play in the new Nassau Coliseum in 1972–73. However, the Nassau County government did not consider the WHA a fully professional league and wanted nothing to do with the Raiders.

Nassau County retained William Shea to get an NHL team to play in the new building. The NHL responded by hastily awarding a franchise to Long Island—the New York Islanders—which forced the Raiders to play in Madison Square Garden, in the shadow of the New York Rangers. On October 7, 1972, the first Islanders game in Nassau Coliseum was played as the Atlanta Flames visited the Islanders. Flames forward Morris Stefaniw scored the first NHL goal in the building at 6:56 of the first period, while Ed Westfall scored the first goal for the Islanders, as the Flames won the game 3–2. The first Islanders&#x27; home win at the arena was on October 12, 1972, where they defeated the Los Angeles Kings 3–2. The Islanders&#x27; first playoff win at the arena came on April 20, 1975, where they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins 4–2. On April 22, 1976, the Islanders earned their first playoff series victory at the arena by defeating the Buffalo Sabres 3–2, and winning the series 4–2.

On February 8, 1983, the arena hosted the 35th National Hockey League All-Star Game, during which Wayne Gretzky scored four goals in the third period and was honored as the game&#x27;s most valuable player.

The Islanders were 11–1 in Stanley Cup Finals games at the Coliseum. Their only loss was a 1–0 setback in Game 1 in 1984 to the Edmonton Oilers. Team&#x27;s fans nicknamed the arena &quot;Fort Neverlose&quot; in honor of the team&#x27;s strong home record during the finals.

Nassau Coliseum hosted minor league hockey prior to the awarding of the Islanders franchise, an event that was brought back in 2005, when the Islanders-affiliated Bridgeport Sound Tigers of the American Hockey League (AHL) played two &quot;home&quot; games at the Coliseum in the absence of NHL hockey due to the 2004–05 NHL lockout. On April 17–18, 2009, the Sound Tigers played two of their home playoff games against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins at the Coliseum due to a scheduling conflict at the Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the team&#x27;s home.

The Islanders played their last game at the Coliseum before moving to Barclays Center on April 25, 2015, beating the Washington Capitals 3–1 in Game 6 of the first round of the 2015 playoffs against the Washington Capitals forcing a Game 7, held in and won by Washington, ending the Islanders&#x27; first run at the Coliseum; in Game 6 Cal Clutterbuck of the Islanders scored the final NHL goal in the building, an empty netter at 19:07 of the third period. Following the 2014–15 season, the Coliseum underwent a major renovation. On September 17, 2017, the Islanders returned to the Nassau Coliseum to face the Philadelphia Flyers for a preseason match up. With the Islanders being unhappy at their home in Brooklyn, the league awarded the Islanders to split their home games during the 2018–19 season between the Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders played their first regular season game back at the Coliseum on December 1, 2018, against the Columbus Blue Jackets, where the Islanders won 3–2. During the 2019 playoffs, the First Round was held at the Coliseum. The Islanders again split the 2019–20 season between Nassau Coliseum and Barclays Center and it was announced by then New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that the Islanders would play the remainder of their games at the Coliseum, while the Islanders new home UBS Arena was being built and the 2020–21 season being the final at the Coliseum. With the COVID-19 pandemic, the Islanders played at Scotiabank Arena and Rogers Place during the 2020 playoffs, and then opened up the 2020–21 season at the Coliseum with no fans.

On June 23, 2021, the Islanders played their final game at the Coliseum, before moving to their new arena, in a 3–2 overtime win in game 6 of the 2021 Stanley Cup semifinals against the Tampa Bay Lightning, with Anthony Beauvillier scoring the overtime goal to force game 7. However, the Islanders lost game 7, thus making game 6 the last major league sporting event held there, and Beauvillier scored the last NHL goal in this arena, and his team achieved a rare feat as a consolation prize: they became the third team (after the 1982–83 Calgary Flames and 1994–95 Quebec Nordiques) to end their arena&#x27;s history with a playoff victory.

===Basketball===
The Coliseum was home to the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association, and later the National Basketball Association, from 1972 to 1977. The first event at the Coliseum was a Nets game against the Pittsburgh Condors on February 11, 1972.

The Nets won two ABA Championships in the Coliseum, with Hall of Famer Julius Erving headlining the team. In 1973–74 the Nets defeated the Utah Stars in five games to capture their first title. The Nets then captured the final American Basketball Association Championship in 1976, defeating the Denver Nuggets in six games. Following the 1976 season the Nets joined the National Basketball Association as part of the ABA–NBA merger.
After their first season in the NBA, the Nets moved to New Jersey. The New Jersey Nets played four seasons at the Rutgers Athletic Center before completion of the Meadowlands Arena at the Meadowlands Sports Complex.

In NCAA Division I men&#x27;s college basketball, the Coliseum hosted the ECAC Metro Region tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) in 1978, 1979, 1980, and 1981. It also has hosted first- and second-round games of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1982, 1994, and 2001.

On November 5, 2015, the Nets announced that their new NBA D-League team, the Long Island Nets, would play at the renovated Coliseum starting in 2017 (the team played their first season at their parent team&#x27;s home, the Barclays Center).

===Other sports===
The Coliseum also hosted the New York Arrows and later the New York Express of the original Major Indoor Soccer League. The Arrows, which existed as a franchise from 1978 to 1984, won the first four MISL championships. The short-lived New York Express played part of the 1986–87 season, ending operations before the All-Star break with financial troubles and a 3–23 record.

The New York Sets of World Team Tennis played their first match at Nassau Coliseum on May 7, 1974, and won the WTT championships in 1976. The team changed its name to the New York Apples for the 1977 season, and played 12 of its 22 home matches at Madison Square Garden and the Felt Forum, repeating as champions. Prior to the 1978 season, the Apples announced that they would leave the Coliseum and play all their home matches in the Madison Square Garden complex.

The Coliseum was home to the New York Saints of the National Lacrosse League from 1989 to 2003. In 2007, it was home to four of the New York Titans National Lacrosse League team&#x27;s eight home games (along with Madison Square Garden).

In 2000, 2005 and 2017, the Professional Bull Riders brought their Built Ford Tough Series (originally Bud Light Cup) to the Coliseum.

On February 24–25, 2006, the Coliseum hosted the 44th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships. It was just the third time the annual event has been held on Long Island. Selling 17,755 tickets over three sessions, it broke (and still holds) the NYSPHSAA wrestling tournament attendance record.

On July 19–20, 2014, the Global RallyCross Championship raced at the Nassau Coliseum parking lot.

On July 22, 2017, the Coliseum hosted UFC on Fox: Weidman vs. Gastelum.

In February 2018, the Coliseum hosted the New York Open, an ATP 250 men&#x27;s tennis tournament replacing the long-running Memphis Open.

In 2019, the Coliseum became the home of the National Lacrosse League&#x27;s New York Riptide. In 2024 the team would relocate to Ottawa.

==Entertainment==

===Concerts===
Elvis Presley performed four sold-out concerts at the Nassau Coliseum on June 22, 23 &amp; 24, 1973. His last Coliseum appearance was on July 19, 1975. In 1977, Elvis had been scheduled for an August 22 concert as part of his second tour of the year, but he died on August 16, the day before the tour was to start. Tickets for the show have become collectors&#x27; items. Several of the songs included on The Beach Boys In Concert album were recorded at The Nassau Coliseum.

The Beach Boys performed to a sold-out audience on June 14, 1974. Their tour promoted the recently released &quot;Holland&quot; album and featured a set list of recent songs as well as several of their early 1960s hits. They were joined onstage by Elton John and Paul Simon for the encore performance. David Bowie performed a radio broadcast from there during his Isolar Tour, in support of the album &quot;Station to Station&quot;. A heavily circulated bootleg of the concert saw official release in 2010 as part of the 2010 reissue of the album, and in 2017 as a separate release, &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot;. Queen played at the Coliseum on February 6, 1977, during their A Day at the Races Tour. The band used footage of their performance of &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot; in the song&#x27;s promotional film. They would return on November 19, 1978, on their Jazz Tour.

Blue Öyster Cult recorded a live version of &quot;Dr. Music&quot; in Nassau Coliseum on December 30, 1981, that was subsequently released on the &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot; album in April 1982.

The Coliseum was one of only two venues in the United States where Pink Floyd mounted their limited run of shows for The Wall Tour. The group performed five concerts from February 24 through 28, 1980 one of which was filmed and only appeared as an underground tape. In August 1988, they recorded and filmed the &quot;Delicate Sound of Thunder&quot; over four nights at the Coliseum.

&quot;Live on Long Island 04–18–80&quot; by The Marshall Tucker Band was the original lineup&#x27;s final concert and the final recording of bassist and founding member Tommy Caldwell, who died just ten days later in an automobile accident. Tommy Caldwell is pictured on the album cover. The Coliseum album was the first to feature a complete concert from the original band. However, the album wasn&#x27;t released until 26 years later. The band was touring in support of their album &quot;Tenth&quot; at the time, and the recording features the songs &quot;It Takes Time&quot; and &quot;Cattle Drive&quot; from that release as well as classics such as &quot;Heard It in a Love Song&quot;, &quot;Searchin&#x27; for a Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t You See&quot;.

Billy Joel&#x27;s concert from his 1982 tour at the Coliseum was recorded for a 1983 HBO concert special and VHS/Laser Disc release, &quot;Billy Joel: Live From Long Island&quot;.

Bruce Springsteen has performed at the arena numerous times, most notably during a three-night stand in December 1980. A number of songs from these shows were part of his 1986 live album, &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;, and full recordings of the three performances were released between 2015 and 2021. The New Year&#x27;s Eve show in particular is often regarded by fans as one of the greatest gigs of Springsteen&#x27;s career.

The 1987 home video &quot;Cliff &#x27;Em All&quot; features a rendition of the song &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica, filmed at Nassau Coliseum on April 28, 1986 (while the band was opening a show for Ozzy Osbourne).
Both The Grateful Dead and Phish frequently played the Coliseum, concerts yielding live albums in both cases: &quot;Go to Nassau&quot;, &quot;Wake Up to Find Out&quot;, &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 13&quot;, &quot;Spring 1990: So Glad You Made It&quot;, &quot;Spring 1990 (album)&quot;, &quot;Spring 1990 (The Other One)&quot; by the Dead; and three installments of the Live Phish Series—&quot;4–2–98&quot;, &quot;4–3–98&quot; and &quot;2-28-03&quot;. The Grateful Dead holds the record for the most performances at the venue by a single act with 42 total shows. A banner was raised during a 2019 Dead &amp; Company show commemorating the 44 combined performances by the Grateful Dead and Dead &amp; Company.

Genesis&#x27; performance at the Coliseum on November 29, 1981 (during the band&#x27;s Abacab Tour) was recorded and filmed for the band&#x27;s &quot;Three Sides Live&quot; album and concert video plus radio broadcast.

Frank Zappa played his final U.S. show on March 25, 1988 at the Coliseum. He was joined onstage by his son, Dweezil Zappa, for the concert&#x27;s encores.

Pink Floyd performed between August 19 and 23, 1988, on their A Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour. The majority of the subsequent live double album Delicate Sound of Thunder was recorded during these shows.

In March 1990, the country supergroup The Highwaymen performed at the Coliseum. Their performance was recorded and was released on VHS in 1991.

===Professional wrestling===
Nassau has been a mainstay of WWE for over 30 years, and has hosted &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; many times, including the taping of a &quot;SmackDown&quot; episode where professional wrestler Droz suffered a (untelevised) career-ending injury in 1999. On August 25, 2002, SummerSlam was hosted at the Coliseum. Later, the WWE held The Great American Bash in 2008, followed by 2010&#x27;s Fatal 4-Way, at the Coliseum. On April 10, 2017, the renovated Coliseum hosted its first episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. In October 2018, the Coliseum hosted Evolution, the promotion&#x27;s first all-women&#x27;s pay-per-view event. On May 10, 1985, the Coliseum hosted the taping of the series premiere of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;, a recurring series of WWF specials broadcast by NBC during the peak of the 1980s professional wrestling boom. On December 14, 2024, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; returned to the Coliseum for the premiere of its second revival as an NBC prime time special.

The Coliseum hosted the opening leg of WrestleMania 2 on April 7, 1986. As part of an ambitious plan to host WrestleMania from three separate venues (alongside the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago and the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena), 16,585 fans saw 4 live matches at the Coliseum with the rest of the event shown to the audience by closed-circuit television. The main event at the Nassau leg was a boxing match between Rowdy Roddy Piper and tough-guy actor Mr. T.

The Coliseum hosted its first AEW pay-per-view, Worlds End on December 30, 2023.

The Nassau Coliseum also hosted several editions of now-defunct WCW&#x27;s &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;. The Coliseum was the only Tri-State area venue the Southern-based WCW was allowed to hold events.

===In film===
Scenes for the 2007 movie &quot;Music and Lyrics&quot; starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore were filmed at the arena.

==Redevelopment==
The Coliseum was the second-oldest arena in active use by a National Hockey League team (after nearby Madison Square Garden), and until the return of the Winnipeg Jets to the league at the 15,004-seat Canada Life Centre in Winnipeg, was the smallest arena in the NHL by total seating capacity. The arena had been considered obsolete for many years, and various Islanders owners tried to replace it.

===The Lighthouse Project===

Team and county officials announced in 2004 a plan called The Lighthouse Project to renovate the Coliseum. The project&#x27;s centerpiece was a 60-story tower that would look like a lighthouse. Other plans included new housing, athletic facilities, a minor league baseball stadium, restaurants, and a hotel. The project would also add trees, water and other natural elements to the area.

On August 14, 2007, Islanders owner Charles Wang and the Lighthouse Development Group partnered with Rexcorp to create a new plan. The 60-story &quot;lighthouse&quot; evolved into two 31-story buildings connected by a footbridge at the top. The project was transformed from a simple renovation of the Coliseum property into a transformation of surrounding properties. Plans called for more 2,000 residential units (20% affordable housing), a hotel, a convention center, a sports technology center, of retail space, and a sports complex next to the renovated Coliseum. The overall project was slated to cost roughly $3.75 billion.

Construction was not planned to begin until at least mid-2009. Nassau County approved the Lighthouse Project in 2006 on a 16–2 vote, and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement was completed after a state-mandated environmental review. The Lighthouse Project was then expected to go before the Town of Hempstead for approval on a change in land zoning. However, the approval was never granted. After the October 2009 deadline passed, the &quot;Long Island Press&quot; reported the Lighthouse Project&#x27;s cancellation. Wang has denied the report.

In May 2010, Mets COO Jeff Wilpon had discussions with Wang about constructing an arena for the Islanders near Citi Field. Wilpon has also discussed buying the Islanders. In June 2010, the FanHouse website reported Jeff and Fred Wilpon, the owner of the Mets, began working with real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (who also worked on Madison Square Garden&#x27;s latest renovation) on a feasibility study of a new Islanders arena in Queens. However, a source from &quot;Newsday&quot; indicated the FanHouse report was not true. There were also reports businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders and move them to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

===2011 proposal to replace arena===

On July 12, 2010, Town Supervisor Kate Murray (R-Hempstead) announced an &quot;alternate zone&quot; for the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum property that downsized the Lighthouse Project to half its proposed size and made the project, according to Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano and the developers, &quot;economically unviable for both the developer and owner of the site.&quot; As a result, Wang, Mangano and the developers decided they would no longer pursue the project.

On May 11, 2011, the Islanders and Nassau County executives announced that county residents would vote on a referendum for approval of a $400 million public bond issue for a new plan to replace the Coliseum. The plan, including the construction of a new $350 million arena as well as a $50 million minor league baseball ballpark nearby, was presented by Wang as a last-ditch effort to keep the Islanders on Long Island. However, voters in Nassau County rejected a proposal by a 57% to 43% margin on August 1, 2011.

On October 24, 2012, the Islanders announced the team would move to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn after their lease expired at the end of the 2014–2015 season. The Islanders played their final game at the Coliseum on April 25, 2015, beating the Washington Capitals 3–1 in Game 6 of the first round of the playoffs against the Washington Capitals forcing a Game 7, held in and won by Washington, ending the Islanders&#x27; run at the Coliseum; in Game 6 Cal Clutterbuck of the Islanders scored the final NHL goal in the building, an empty netter at 19:07 of the third period.

===Renovation===
Not long after the Islanders announced their move to Brooklyn, Forest City Enterprises, the owner of Barclays Center, was chosen to perform a study on development possibilities for the Nassau Coliseum site. A request for proposal was issued as a result of this study to transform the arena into a smaller sized venue and its surrounding parking lot into an entertainment hub with theaters, sports bars, and retail.

Four competing proposals were submitted in May 2013, and Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano selected two finalists in July 2013, including one from a group led by Forest City Ratner. Ratner&#x27;s proposal called for a reduction of the Coliseum&#x27;s capacity to 13,000 seats and a revamp of the arena&#x27;s interior and concrete facade designed by SHoP Architects, the firm which designed the Barclays Center, which would cost the group approximately $89 million. As part of his bid, the Islanders would play 6 games per season in the arena, the Brooklyn Nets would play one exhibition game, and a minor league hockey team would call the arena home.

On August 15, 2013, Nassau County announced Forest City had won the bid for the renovation of the Nassau Coliseum and the surrounding property, pending approval from the Nassau legislature and zoning changes from the Hempstead town government. The Nassau County Legislature unanimously approved the bid on September 24, 2013.

Billy Joel performed the arena&#x27;s final pre-renovation concert on August 4, 2015.

On April 5, 2017, a Billy Joel concert was the arena&#x27;s first post-renovation event. Other acts that performed during the new Coliseum&#x27;s opening week include Stevie Nicks, The Pretenders, Idina Menzel, Lionel Richie, Mariah Carey, and Marc Anthony.

On November 4, 2016, Brooklyn Sports &amp; Entertainment reached a naming rights deal with New York Community Bank. The cost of the naming rights and the agreement&#x27;s length were not disclosed. The deal with the county mandated the inclusion of &quot;Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum&quot; in the arena&#x27;s name; the naming rights were initially announced as having named the venue &quot;Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum presented by New York Community Bank&quot;, but this was later revised to NYCB Live: Home of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus performed their final show at Nassau Coliseum on May 21, 2017. This was their only show at Nassau Coliseum post-renovation.

===Belmont Park arena and Islanders’ temporary return===

In late January 2017, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported via internal sources that Barclays Center was considering dropping the Islanders due to poor attendance and their effects on the venue&#x27;s profits. The venue has received a poor reception as a hockey arena due to poor sight lines and ice conditions, as Barclays was primarily designed as a basketball arena. &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that Nassau County executive Edward Mangano had met with Islanders co-owner Jonathan Ledecky, and he told the paper the Islanders could return to the renovated Nassau Coliseum. These reports were further elaborated by Long Island Association president Kevin Law in April 2017, who stated that Brooklyn Sports &amp; Entertainment (who manages both venues) was preparing to offer a relocation plan to the team. Law felt that the alternate option of seeking a new arena in Belmont Park was redundant to the renovated Coliseum. The Islanders played a preseason game against the Philadelphia Flyers on September 17, 2017, their first appearance at the renovated Coliseum.

The renovation project reduced the capacity of the arena to 13,900, a level which was believed to be unsustainable for an NHL team; in comparison, the Islanders&#x27; average attendance at Barclays was 12,059, the lowest in the NHL (Barclays Center was the second-smallest arena in the NHL based on seating capacity at 15,795, which was around 400 seats fewer than the Coliseum pre-renovation). As such, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman felt that returning was not a &quot;viable option&quot; for the Islanders, but noted that the team was &quot;in the process of evaluating what makes the most sense for the franchise and particularly for their fans.&quot;

In December 2017, New York Arena Partners (a venture of the Islanders, Oak View Group, and Sterling Equities) won a bid to construct a new, 18,000-seat arena and mixed-use district at Belmont Park, beating a competing proposal by New York City FC for a new soccer stadium. The new arena opened for the 2021–22 season.

In January 2018, Islanders owner Jon Ledecky revealed on WFAN&#x27;s &quot;Boomer and Gio&quot; that he had toured the renovated Coliseum with Bettman and other senior NHL officials. They assessed that the Islanders could play a limited schedule of home games at the Coliseum, but that it would not be sustainable as a full-time venue because of its capacity and diminished amenities (such as few corporate suites) over other newly built arenas. On January 23, 2018, it was reported that Barclays Center was pushing for a short-term lease under which the Islanders would split their home games between Barclays Center and Nassau Coliseum until the Belmont Park arena is completed, with the number of games at the Coliseum steadily increasing for each year of the arrangement.

On June 21, 2018, it was announced that the Islanders would play a portion of their home schedule at the Coliseum until the completion of the new arena, with 12 games moved in the 2018–19 season. The number of games during the 2018–19 season at the Coliseum was later increased to 20.

The Islanders used the Coliseum as their home rink during the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs but moved back to the Barclays Center for the rest of the 2019 playoffs.

In September 2019, it was announced that in the 2019–20 season, the Islanders would play 28 of their 41 home games at the Coliseum. On February 29, 2020, state governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the Islanders would play any home playoff games of the 2020 playoffs and all 2020–21 season home games at the Coliseum. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHL season was suspended and continued in a bio-secure bubble later in the year, with the Islanders playing most of their playoff games at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto before traveling to Rogers Place in Edmonton for the Eastern Conference finals (their first conference finals appearance since 1993).

The Islanders played their final game at the renovated Coliseum on June 23, 2021, defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning 3–2 in overtime of Game 6 of the Stanley Cup semifinals. Anthony Beauvillier scored the final goal of the Islanders&#x27; second stint at the Coliseum. However, the Lightning would win Game 7 in Tampa to end the Islanders&#x27; season.

===New leaseholders===
In June 2020, Mikhail Prokhorov, whose company ran the Nassau Coliseum, announced that the arena would be closed indefinitely while it sought new investors to take it over and assume the remaining debt as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. NYCB pulled out of its naming rights contract in late August 2020.

In August 2020, Nassau Coliseum&#x27;s lease was taken over by Nassau Live Center, LLC, which is headed by a Florida-based businessman Nick Mastroianni II, whose company was responsible for the loan to help with the renovation of the arena. The new leaseholder agreed to let the Islanders play their home games in the arena until the UBS Arena was finished.

===Sands New York proposal===

In 2023, Las Vegas Sands submitted a bid to lease the property of the Nassau Coliseum and construct an integrated resort, consisting of a casino, 1,670 hotel rooms and convention space, retail, dining and outdoor community spaces, possibly including demolition of the Coliseum. Since the announcement, parts of the local community surrounding the Coliseum has spoken out against it, citing a potential increase of traffic and congestion in the area. The Nassau County Legislature voted 17–1 with one recusal to transfer the Coliseum lease to the Sands, but in November a state judge struck down the deal, citing the County did not adequately provide enough transparent, public hearings for the project. In May 2024, the county announced it planned to resubmit the lease-transfer application.

<text>Willis Smith (December 19, 1887June 26, 1953) was an American attorney and Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1950 and 1953.

==Early life and education==
Born in Norfolk Virginia, he moved to North Carolina before age 2. After graduating from Trinity College (now the undergraduate liberal arts college of Duke University) in 1910 and Duke University Law School in 1912, he became a practicing attorney—but interrupted his work to serve in the United States Army during World War I. In 1912, he founded the law firm that eventually became known as Smith, Anderson, Blount, Dorsett, Mitchell &amp; Jernigan (informally &quot;Smith Anderson&quot;).

==Political career==
Smith served in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1927 to 1932, and was briefly the speaker of that body in 1931. He also served as a U.S. observer at the Nuremberg Trials in 1946, as chairman of the American delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Bern, Switzerland in 1952, as chairman of the Duke University board of trustees (1947 - 1953), and as president of the American Bar Association (1945-1946).

In the Democratic primary of 1950, Smith defeated incumbent Sen. Frank Porter Graham for the nomination. Graham had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of J. Melville Broughton and had served only a little over a year at the time of his defeat. In a campaign distinguished by race-baiting, Graham, who was well known for his civil rights sympathies, was supported by President Harry Truman and the state&#x27;s liberal Democratic faction, while Smith was aided by strategist Jesse Helms.

Smith&#x27;s service in the Senate was brief and unremarkable.

== Death ==
He died due to coronary thrombosis in 1953 in Bethesda, Maryland and was interred at the Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

<doc id="516601" wikidata="Q443839" url="?curid=516601" title="Alton Lennon">
<text>Alton Asa Lennon (August 17, 1906December 28, 1986) was an American Democratic politician who represented North Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate. He first served as an interim appointment to the Senate from 1953 to 1954, unsuccessfully sought re-election, and later represented the Cape Fear region in the House from 1957 to 1973. Lennon is one of very few former senators in modern times to serve in the House after leaving the Senate.

==Early life and education==
Lennon was born in Wilmington, North Carolina August 17, 1906. He was the son of Rosser Yates Lennon and Minnie (High) Lennon. He attended the public schools, and graduated from Wake Forest College in 1929. He was admitted to the bar in 1929 and began practice in Wilmington. He married Karine Welch on October 12, 1933.

==Political career==
Lennon served as the judge of New Hanover County Recorder&#x27;s Court from 1934 to 1942. He was elected to the North Carolina State Senate in 1947, and served until 1951. Lennon was appointed on July 10, 1953, as a Democrat to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Willis Smith and served from July 10, 1953, to November 28, 1954. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the nomination in 1954 to fill the vacancy. He resumed law practice, then was elected as a Democrat to the 85th Congress, and was reelected to the seven succeeding Congresses (January 3, 1957 – January 3, 1973).

Lennon voted in Congress against civil rights and social legislation, although about half of the constituents in his district were African-Americans or Native Americans. Lennon voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968 as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1966, he was the only Southerner to vote against citing seven Ku Klux Klan leaders for contempt of Congress. He said, &quot;I never heard it said that Klansmen were subversive or affiliated with any foreign government to overthrow the United States.&quot; In 1966, Lennon urged that North Vietnamese ports be bombed, and in 1967 he called for the Justice Department to prosecute Stokely Carmichael, the black activist, for making statements against the military draft.

He declined to seek reelection in 1972. Although he was a Democrat, Lennon campaigned for the re-election of Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative Republican, in 1978.

==Personal life and legacy==
He was a resident of Wilmington, N.C., until his death there December 28, 1986.

In 1976, the Federal Building and Courthouse at Wilmington was named in his honor.

<text>Benjamin Everett Jordan (September 8, 1896 – March 15, 1974) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a United States Senator from North Carolina from 1958 to 1973.

==Early life and education==
The eldest of six children, B. Everett Jordan was born in Ramseur, North Carolina, to Rev. Henry Harrison and Annie Elizabeth (née Sellars) Jordan. His father was a Methodist minister who also worked as a circuit rider. After receiving his early education at public schools, he attended Rutherford College Preparatory School from 1912 to 1913.

In 1914, Jordan enrolled at Trinity College (now Duke University) in Durham. He dropped out the following year and moved to Wellington, Kansas, where he went to work at his uncle&#x27;s jewelry store. Towards the end of World War I, he served overseas with the Tank Corps of the United States Army (1918–1919). He was later assigned to the occupation forces in Germany.

==Business career==

Following his military service, Jordan returned to North Carolina and became a floor sweeper at Myrtle Textile Mill in Gastonia. He became the plant superintendent of the Gastonia Textile Company in 1923. Four years later, in 1927, he and his family purchased an abandoned textile mill in Saxapahaw, renaming it Sellars Manufacturing Company. He served as the company&#x27;s secretary-treasurer and general manager, later turning over management to his sons in order to focus on his political career. He also helped revive the Saxapahaw community, employing local residents and building a community center.

In addition to working with his family&#x27;s business, Jordan served as general manager, treasurer, and director of the Jordan Spinning Company near Franklinville, and held the same positions with the Royal Cotton Mill Company in Wake Forest. He was also secretary-treasurer of the National Processing Company in Burlington, and director of the Cotton Textile Institute and of the North Carolina Cotton Manufacturers Association. A devout Methodist like his father, he was an adult Bible instructor (1927–1958), chairman of the Methodist Board of Stewards (1930–1950), and vice-president of the Board of Methodist Colleges (1952–1956).

==Political career==
Jordan became active in Democratic politics in the 1930s, working as a fundraiser for the North Carolina Democratic Party. The husband of his first cousin, W. Kerr Scott, was elected Governor of North Carolina in 1948. From 1949 to 1954, he served as chairman of the Democratic State Executive Committee. He was a Democratic National Committeeman from 1954 to 1958. He also served as a member of the North Carolina Peace Officers Benefit and Retirement Commission (1943–1958) and of the North Carolina Medical Care Commission (1945–1951), and chairman of the board of trustees of Alamance County General Hospital.

===U.S. Senate===
Governor Scott had been elected a United States Senator in 1954, but died four years later. On April 19, 1958, Jordan was appointed to the Senate by Governor Luther H. Hodges to fill the vacancy caused by Scott&#x27;s death. On November 4 of that year, he was elected to complete the final two years of Scott&#x27;s term, defeating Republican Richard C. Clarke Jr. by a margin of 70%–30%.

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration (1963–1973), he led the investigation of Senate aide Bobby Baker in 1964. Jordan supported research in medical science and agriculture, industrial uses of farm products, missile development, and space exploration. He sponsored the Cotton Allotment Transfer Act, which assisted farmers with small allotments. Like most Southern senators, he was a supporter of segregation. Although he supported the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, he later joined a majority of senators in calling for American forces to be brought home. At this, his senior colleague, Sam Ervin, asked him, &quot;Everett, have you lost your mind?&quot;

He was re-elected to the Senate in 1960 and 1966. Jordan was unseated in the 1972 Democratic primary by Representative Nick Galifianakis of Durham. Jordan polled only 44.5 percent in the primary, to 55.5 percent for Galifianakis. Galifianakis in turn was defeated by Republican Jesse Helms in the general election. At the time, Jordan was 76 and his health was beginning to fail.

===1972 sniper incident===

On May 29, 1972, Jordan escaped injury during a shooting while campaigning at Raleigh&#x27;s North Hills Shopping Center, when 22-year-old Harvey Glenn McLeod opened fire from the parking lot with a Ruger 10/22 rifle, killing four people and injuring seven others before taking his own life. Jordan press aide Wes Hayden sustained critical injuries in the shooting; he made a surprisingly swift recovery and returned to his office in just one month. McLeod&#x27;s motives were inscrutable, although his mother described him as &quot;nervous and depressed&quot; prior to the incident. McLeod was not believed to be targeting Jordan, whose campaign stop at the shopping center was unannounced.

==Death and legacy==
Jordan died at his home in Saxapahaw, at age 77. He is buried at Pine Hill Cemetery in Burlington.

B. Everett Jordan Lake, in Chatham County, North Carolina, is named for Senator Jordan, as well as the elementary school in Saxapahaw, North Carolina, B. Everett Jordan Elementary School, part of the Alamance-Burlington School System.

==Personal life==
In 1924, Jordan married Katherine McLean, to whom he remained married until his death. The couple had two sons, Benjamin Everett Jr. and John McLean, and one daughter, Rose Ann.

<doc id="516639" wikidata="Q206716" url="?curid=516639" title="Agalmatophilia">
<text>Agalmatophilia () is a paraphilia involving sexual attraction to a statue, doll, mannequin, or other similar figurative object. Agalmatophilia is a form of object sexuality.

The attraction may include a desire for actual sexual contact with the object, a fantasy of having sexual (or non-sexual) encounters with an animate or inanimate instance of the preferred object, the act of watching encounters between such objects, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into the preferred object.

Depending on the object of their desire, agalmatophiles can exhibit pygmalionism, the love for an object of one&#x27;s own creation, named after the myth of Pygmalion, where a man falls in love with a statue he made of his ideal woman. English poet Edmund Spenser wrote of sexual pygmalionism in some of his works.

==History==
Agalmatophilia was described in late eighteenth- and nineteenth-century legal medicine.

In 1977, a gardener was recorded to have fallen in love with a statue of the &quot;Venus de Milo,&quot; and was discovered attempting coitus with it.

<doc id="516643" wikidata="Q706268" url="?curid=516643" title="Juraj Jánošík">
<text>Juraj Jánošík (first name also Juro or Jurko, ; baptised 25 January 1688, died 17 March 1713) was a Slovak highwayman. Jánošík has been the main character of many Slovak novels, poems, and films. According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, a deed often attributed to the famous Robin Hood. The legend is known in neighboring Poland (under the name Jerzy Janoszik also Janosik, Janiczek or Janicek) and the Czech Republic as well as Slovakia. The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend, whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor. However, the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when Jánošík became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary (much in present-day Slovakia) and among the local Gorals inhabitants of the Podhale region north of the Tatras. The image of Jánošík as a symbol of resistance to oppression was reinforced when poems about him became part of the Slovak and Czech middle and high school literature curriculum, and then again with the numerous films that propagated his modern legend in the 20th century. During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising, one of the partisan groups bore his name.

==Biography==

Jánošík was born on 25 January 1688, and baptised shortly after. His parents were Martin Jánošík and Anna Čišníková from Terchová. His godparents were Jakub Merjad and Barbara Krištofíková.

He grew up in the village of Terchová in the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s Kingdom of Hungary area (present-day Žilina District in northwestern Slovakia). He fought alongside the Kuruc insurgents when he was fifteen. After the lost Battle of Trenčín, Jánošík was recruited by the Habsburg army. In autumn 1710, as a young prison guard in Bytča, he helped the imprisoned escape. They formed a highwayman group and Jánošík became its leader at the age of 23, after Uhorčík left to settle in Klenovec. The group was active mostly in northwestern Kingdom of Hungary (today&#x27;s Slovakia), around the Váh river between Važec and Východná, but the territory of their activity extended also to other parts of today&#x27;s Slovakia, as well as to Poland and Moravia. Most of their victims were rich merchants. Under Jánošík&#x27;s leadership, the group was exceptionally chivalrous: they did not kill any of the robbed victims and even helped an accidentally injured priest. They are also said to have shared their loot with the poor and this part of the legend may be based on the facts too.

Jánošík was captured in autumn 1712 and detained at the Mansion of Hrachovo, but was released soon afterwards. He was captured again in spring of 1713, in the Uhorčík&#x27;s residence in Klenovec (Klenóc). Uhorčík lived there under the false name Martin Mravec at that time. According to a widespread legend, he was caught in a pub run by Tomáš Uhorčík, after slipping on spilled peas, thrown in his way by a treacherous old lady. Jánošík was imprisoned and tried in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, (present-day Liptovský Mikuláš).

His trial took place on 16 and 17 March 1713, when he was sentenced to death. The date of his execution was not recorded, but it was customary to carry it out as soon as the trial was over. The manner of his execution, not in public awareness until the early 19th century, became part of his modern legend. A hook was pierced through his left side and he was left dangling on the gallows to die. The brutal way of execution was reserved for leaders of robber bands. However, sources diverge about how he was executed, and it is also possible that Jánošík was hanged. A legend says that he refused the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; offered in exchange for naming his associates with the words: &quot;If you have baked me so you should also eat me!&quot; and jumped on the hook.

<text>The Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium (later Corporation), most commonly known as MECC, was an organization founded in 1973 best known for developing the edutainment video game series &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; and its spin-offs. The goal of the organization was to coordinate and provide computer services to schools in the state of Minnesota, but its software eventually became popular in schools around the world. MECC had its headquarters in the Brookdale Corporate Center in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. It was acquired by SoftKey in 1995 and was shut down in 1999.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
During the 1960s, Minnesota was a center of computer technology, what &quot;City Pages&quot; would describe 50 years later as a &quot;Midwestern Silicon Valley&quot;. IBM, Honeywell, Control Data and other companies had facilities in the state. In 1963, their presence inspired a group of teachers at the University of Minnesota College of Education&#x27;s laboratory school to introduce computers into classrooms via teleprinters and time-sharing. The group began with long-distance calls to Dartmouth College&#x27;s General Electric computer to use John George Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz&#x27;s new Dartmouth BASIC language, then moved to Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Company&#x27;s own GE computer. In 1968, twenty Minneapolis–Saint Paul area school districts and the College of Education founded Total Information for Educational Systems (TIES) to provide time-sharing service on a HP 2000, training, and software. The presence of computer-company employees on many school boards accelerated the expansion of TIES and helped make Minnesota a leader in computer-based education.

The success of TIES, and that of similar projects run by Minneapolis Public Schools and Minnesota State University, Mankato, led to the founding of MECC in 1973 by the state legislature. As a Joint Powers Authority, with the support of the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, and the Minnesota Department of Education, MECC&#x27;s role was to study and coordinate computer use in schools for both administrative and educational purposes. Schools, including the universities, had to get MECC&#x27;s approval for most computing expenses, and were also its customers for computer-related services. After study of educational needs, a single educational computer center in the Minneapolis area was recommended for use by schools throughout the state (the University of Minnesota&#x27;s MERITSS computer provided time-sharing services to its campuses and to state universities). MECC hoped that every Minnesota school, regardless of size, would have a terminal connected to the computer center.

=== Computing facilities ===
SUMITS, a UNIVAC 1110 mainframe was installed at the MECC facility at 1925 Sather (address later changed to 2520 Broadway Drive), next to Highway 280. A sturdy industrial building originally used for electrical maintenance, part of the building was already occupied by the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Lauderdale computing facility. SUMITS was a batch processing system, albeit not a time-sharing system, and its performance failed to meet the terms of the contract. In 1977 it was replaced with a Control Data Corporation Cyber 73 mainframe, known as the MECC Timesharing System (MTS). It became the largest such system for education in the world, with up to 448 simultaneous connections from up to 2,000 terminals throughout the state, most of them Teletype Model 33 teleprinters, connected at 110 and 300 baud through telephones by using acoustically coupled modems. After several years most of the phone lines were replaced with direct circuits to schools across the state.

By 1982 MTS had more than 950 programs in its library. One of the most popular was &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, originally written for the Minneapolis Public Schools&#x27; computer. Programming was the largest single use for MTS, with up to 45% of the system used for one of almost one dozen computer languages. To support its larger number of users—70 to 80% of all Minnesota public schools in 1981, and available to 96% of Minnesota students from 7 am to 11 pm daily by 1982—primarily using programs written in the BASIC language, both timesharing systems developed shared memory (MULTI) BASIC systems. Through this – and less efficient methods – multiuser programs and chat systems appeared in addition to electronic mail and BBS programs; some of these were derived from MERITSS programs.

While some of the ideas may have been derived from MERITSS, the multi programs were more efficient. The MERITSS chat program, even though it operated via fast access system files, could not match the efficiency of a MULTI chat program that copied the input/output into memory to be delivered to the user.

The University of Minnesota Computer Center (UCC as it was called then) rejected implementing MULTI due to concerns about system stability. UCC tried to retrofit the MULTI-mail program for its own use because of the good user interface, but it was not possible. They then tried again with an older fast access system file version, and while it worked, it was unreliable. After doing test runs with several other universities&#x27; mail programs, two developers at UCC implemented their own version, which also contained a message board feature, and was the campus-wide e-mail solution for a couple of years.

=== Microcomputer technology ===
As MECC&#x27;s Cyber 73 entered into service, microcomputers began to appear. In 1978 it appeared that features wished for in the classroom, such as a graphical display, were available. Through an evaluation and bidding process, the Apple II was chosen by MECC for state schools over other candidates, such as the Radio Shack TRS-80; the win was an important early deal in the history of Apple Inc. Any school in the state could buy Apple computers through MECC, which resold them at cost, without having to go through complex evaluation and purchasing procedures. Through what &quot;InfoWorld&quot; described as an &quot;enviable showcase&quot; for its products Apple sold more than 2,000 computers during the next three years and more than 5,000 by 1983, making MECC the company&#x27;s largest reseller. In late 1981 MECC switched to a discount agreement for the Atari 8-bit computers, and distributed software through the Atari Program Exchange. The use of microcomputers quickly increased, with 85% of school districts using them by 1981 compared to 75% for time-sharing, and the Cyber 73 shut down in 1983. By then each Minnesota public school had an average of three to four computers, compared to only 20 Milwaukee elementary schools (out of 110) with computers. MECC offered computer training to teachers and administrators, and 10 consortium consultants traveled throughout the state assisting school districts.

MECC developed hundreds of microcomputer educational programs, many converted from the time-sharing original; by 1979 some MECC programs for the Apple II could be downloaded from the timesharing system. MECC distributed &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot; and other titles in its library to Minnesota schools for free, and charged others $10 to $20 for diskettes, each containing several programs. By July 1981 it had 29 software packages available. Projector slides, student worksheets, and other resources for teachers accompanied the software.

As control over computer resources moved to local levels within Minnesota, MECC&#x27;s focus on selling software grew. Beginning in 1980 with the Iowa Department of Education, 5,000 school districts around the world purchased site licenses for MECC software. It distributed 250,000 copies of MECC software around the world by 1982, and the &quot;Institutional Membership&quot; business became so successful that state subsidies ended. In 1983 MECC became a taxable, profit-making company, owned by the state of Minnesota but otherwise independent. By the 1985–1986 school year MECC offered more than 300 products and had about $7million in annual sales.

== Activities ==
During its lifetime, the company produced a number of programs that would become well known to Generation X and Millennial students across the U.S. Besides &quot;Oregon Trail&quot;, titles included &quot;The Secret Island of Dr. Quandary&quot;, &quot;The Yukon Trail&quot;, &quot;The Amazon Trail&quot;, &quot;Odell Lake&quot;, &quot;Zoyon Patrol&quot;, &quot;Number Munchers&quot;, &quot;Word Munchers&quot;, &quot;Fraction Munchers&quot;, &quot;Super Munchers&quot;, &quot;Lemonade Stand&quot;, &quot;Spellevator&quot;, &quot;Storybook Weaver&quot;, &quot;My Own Stories&quot;, &quot;Museum Madness&quot;, &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Journeys&quot;, and &quot;DinoPark Tycoon&quot;. The game &quot;Freedom!&quot;, which had the player try to escape from slavery on the Underground Railroad, was released in 1992 but pulled from the market in 1993 following complaints from parents about its classroom use.

== Acquisition by SoftKey ==
MECC was financially successful and dominated the market for Apple II software used within schools, but its management believed that the company needed more capital in order to compete for the home market and to develop software for other platforms, such as the IBM PC and the Macintosh. As the state of Minnesota did not have the capital to fund such plans, it spun off the company as a private corporation in 1991 to the venture capital fund North American Fund II for $5.25million. An IPO followed in March 1994. In October 1995, the publicly traded company, with about $30million in annual revenue—about one third from &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;—was acquired by SoftKey for $370million in stock as part of a series of consolidations in the educational software market.

Although MECC continued to develop software after its acquisition, including the successful &quot;Oregon Trail II&quot; in 1995, Softkey (then named The Learning Company) was acquired by Mattel in 1999 in what &quot;Businessweek&quot; called one of &quot;the Worst Deals of All Time&quot;, leading to the a great deal of financial repercussions that year, including the closure of the MECC offices in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, in October 1999.

<text>Bedford Brown (June 6, 1795 – December 6, 1870) was a Democratic United States Senator from the State of North Carolina between 1829 and 1840.

==Biography==
Bedford Brown was born on June 6, 1795, in what now is Locust Hill Township, Caswell County, North Carolina. His parents were Jethro Brown and Lucy Williamson Brown. After attending the University of North Carolina for one year, Brown was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons.

On July 13, 1816, Brown married Mary Lumpkin Glenn. The couple had seven children: William Livingston, Bedford, Jr., Wilson Glenn, Isabella Virginia, Laura, and Rosalie.

In 1828, upon the death of Bartlett Yancey, Jr., Brown was chosen in a special election to replace Yancey in the North Carolina Senate. Like Bartlett Yancey, Jr., before him, Brown was elected Speaker of the North Carolina Senate.

In 1829, he was elected as a Jacksonian (the party that would become the Democratic Party) to succeed John Branch as a United States Senator from North Carolina. In the Senate, he chaired several committees, including the Agriculture Committee. Brown resigned his seat in 1840 due to a dispute with the state legislature. He was elected to the state Senate again in 1842, before spending some years out of the state.

Leading up to the Civil War, Brown, a state senator again from 1858 to 1860, counseled in favor of North Carolina&#x27;s remaining in the Union. However, after President Lincoln requested troops from North Carolina to serve in the Union Army, Brown, along with most of his colleagues, supported secession.

In 1868 Brown, still a Democrat, was again elected to the North Carolina Senate. However, the Reconstruction Republicans controlled the North Carolina Legislature and refused to seat Brown. He was replaced by Republican John W. Stephens.

Brown was buried on the grounds at Rose Hill, just outside Yanceyville, North Carolina. Rose Hill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

==Descendants==
Brown was the grandfather of architect Glenn Brown.

<doc id="516653" wikidata="Q2543297" url="?curid=516653" title="Chuck Collins">
<text>Chuck Collins (born October 19, 1959) is an American author and a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, DC, where he directs the Program on Inequality and the Common Good. He is also co-founder of Wealth for Common Good. He is an expert on economic inequality in the US, and has pioneered efforts to bring together investors and business leaders to speak out publicly against corporate practices and economic policies that increase economic inequality.

Collins is the great-grandson of Oscar F. Mayer, the founder of the Oscar Mayer meat processing brand.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Madison, Wisconsin and grew up in suburban Detroit where he attended the Cranbrook Schools. At age 7, he witnessed the 1967 Detroit riots and became concerned about inequality. He was involved in social change, including Earth Day 1970. He raised money for guide dogs and informed his neighborhood about the environment at a young age.

Collins first gained public attention in 1985, when he gave an inheritance of $500,000 to several foundations at the age of 26. When his libertarian conservative father Edward learned of his intentions, he was afraid his son was a Marxist, though Collins instead stated that he would rather be called a &quot;Gandhian or Christian&quot; and later left to live in a commune.

==Education==
Collins is a graduate of Hampshire College (Bachelor of Arts, 1984), and holds a master&#x27;s degree (1987) from the School of Community Economic Development at Southern New Hampshire University.

==Career==
Between 1983 and 1991, Collins worked at the Institute for Community Economics, based in Greenfield, Massachusetts, providing technical advice to community land trusts and mobile home resident cooperatives. Between 1991 and 1995, he was director of the HOME Coalition in Massachusetts and a field organizer for the Tax Equity Alliance of Massachusetts (now the Mass Budget and Policy Center). In 1995, he co-founded, with Felice Yeskel and S.M. Miller, United for a Fair Economy in Boston, Massachusetts, a left-leaning national organization devoted to education about growing income and wealth inequality.

In 2005, he became a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, where he co-edits the web site, Inequality.org, and directs the Program on Inequality and the Common Good. In 2008, he cofounded Wealth for the Common Good, which subsequently merged in 2015 with the Patriotic Millionaires.

At the Institute for Policy Studies, Collins research has looked at income and wealth inequality and the racial wealth divide. He has co-authored a number of studies including &quot;Billionaire Bonanza&quot; exploring the share of wealth flowing to the top 1 percent and Forbes 400, and the &quot;Ever Growing Gap&quot;, which examines the future of the racial wealth divide.

==Publications==
Collins has written a number of books about inequality, tax policy and social change philanthropy. In 2000, he co-authored the book, &quot;Robin Hood Was Right: A Guide to Giving Your Money for Social Change&quot;. In 2000 (revised in 2005), he co-authored with Felice Yeskel, &quot;Economic Apartheid in America: A Primer on Economic Inequality and Insecurity&quot;. Collins is coauthor, with Bill Gates Sr., of the 2003 book, &quot;Wealth and Our Commonwealth: Why America Should Tax Accumulated Fortunes&quot;, which argues that the estate tax is both fair and necessary. In 2013, he authored &quot;99 to 1: How Wealth Inequality is Wrecking the World and What We Can Do About It&quot;. &quot;Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good&quot; was published in 2016. In 2021 he published &quot;The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Spend Millions to Hide Trillions&quot;. In 2023, he published a novel, &quot;Altar to An Erupting Sun,&quot; a provocative work of eco-fiction and history.

==Personal life==

Collins is the great-grandson of German-born American meatpacker Oscar F. Mayer (founder of the Oscar Mayer food corporation), and is the grandson of the American pianist and composer Edward Joseph Collins.

<text>John Pool (June 16, 1826August 16, 1884) was a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of North Carolina between 1868 and 1873. He was also the uncle of Congressman Walter Freshwater Pool.

He was born in Pasquotank County, North Carolina near Elizabeth City and was tutored at home until his attendance at the University of North Carolina, where he studied law. He graduated and was admitted to the bar in 1847, practicing in his home city until serving in the North Carolina Senate in 1856 and 1858. Pool ran against Gov. John W. Ellis in the 1860 election as head of the &quot;Opposition Party,&quot; which consisted primarily of former Whigs, like himself.

With the war-weariness increasing in civilian parts of the Confederacy during 1863, pro-Union activities began to become organized as resistance. The Loyal Order of the Heroes of America, also known as the &quot;Red Strings&quot;, were started by several men from North Carolina, including Henderson Adams, North Carolina&#x27;s State Auditor during this time. The actual leader was John Pool, who spent some time in a jail in Richmond, and who traveled through western Virginia in 1864. While in West Virginia it was known that John Pool was part of (had joined in response to the Masons being against his &quot;Red Stringed Beliefs&quot;) a fraternal brotherhood known only as ECV or E Clampus Vitus (different spellings were also recorded &quot;E Clampsus Vatus, E Clampses Vitus and E Vitus Clampsus) which helped care for the families of fallen miners. The order is known to still be around today in the western states.

He was elected by the legislature to serve in the U.S. Senate as a Republican once North Carolina was readmitted in 1868. After his single term, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. until his death in 1884. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery.

<text>Augustus Summerfield Merrimon (September 15, 1830November 14, 1892) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1873 and 1879.

An attorney from Buncombe County, North Carolina, Merrimon served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1860 to 1861. He briefly served in the Confederate Army when the American Civil War broke out, but resigned to become solicitor (prosecutor) for North Carolina&#x27;s eighth judicial district. After the war, Merrimon served as a state superior court judge, then returned to the practice of law, and was an unsuccessful Democratic (at the time, officially called the Conservative Party) candidate for Governor of North Carolina in 1872. With 49.5 percent of the vote, Merrimon lost an extremely close race to incumbent Tod R. Caldwell. 

Merrimon was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1872. He and former Gov. Zebulon B. Vance had already become intense political enemies, though both were affiliated with the Conservative Party. After Vance won the endorsement of the Conservative Party in the legislature, the minority Republicans in the legislature voted with Merrimon&#x27;s supporters to elect him to the Senate (New York Times, October 14, 1878).

During his term in the Senate, Merrimon gained a reputation as &quot;one of the bitterest partisan Democrats in Congress&quot; (New York Times, October 14, 1878). He was appointed to the &#x27;South Carolina Committee,&#x27; a Congressional commission assigned to conduct hearings into voter intimidation and fraud during the 1876 elections in South Carolina—the elections which brought an end to Reconstruction and restored white supremacists to power. The only Democrat on the Committee, Merrimon badgered black and white Republican witnesses and attempted to downplay and excuse white atrocities. A full transcript of the testimony can be found in the 3 bound volumes (&quot;South Carolina in 1876&quot;) published by the 42nd Congress. After Vance was elected Governor in 1876, he began recruiting candidates to defeat Merrimon supporters in legislative races to lay the groundwork to take Merrimon&#x27;s seat in the Senate. In the legislative election of 1878, the state Democrats ran two slates in many districts: one pledged to Merrimon and one pledged to Vance. The result was mixed; the Republicans gained 13 seats in the legislature, and the majority Democrats were still divided in their loyalties (Merrimon 40 to Vance 60 with 70 Republicans). The Republican legislators voted for Vance in the election in early 1879, giving him the majority.

After being defeated for re-election, Merrimon served as an associate justice (1883–1889) and then Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court (1889 until his death in 1892). Merrimon Avenue in Asheville is named in his memory.

His home at Raleigh, the Merrimon-Wynne House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and again in 2014 following a move.

<text>Ivo Robić (28 January 1923 – 9 March 2000) was a Croatian singer-songwriter.

==Domestic career==

Robić began his career as a soloist with the Radio Zagreb Orchestra, while studying at the same time in Zagreb. He performed during World War II on &quot;Krugovalna postaja Zagreb&quot; in an Esplanade hotel in Zagreb, Independent State of Croatia.

During his career in what was then Socialist Republic of Croatia, he made more than one hundred records, mostly singles and &quot;schlagers&quot;. In his own country, the most memorable of his many schlagers might be &quot;Vraćam se Zagrebe tebi&quot; (Coming Back to You, My Zagreb), &quot;Ta tvoja ruka mala&quot; (That Little Hand of Yours), and &quot;Tiho plove moje čežnje&quot; (Silent Sail of My Yearnings).

==International achievements==
A pioneer of popular Croatian music from the early 1950s on, Robić was an artist who successfully pursued both domestic and international careers for almost half a century. When he began, he was the only artist from Croatia whose records were available in the record shops of Europe and the rest of the world.

Robić was nicknamed &quot;Mister Morgen&quot; following the success of his first international hit, &quot;Morgen&quot; (which means &quot;tomorrow&quot;), in 1959. The optimistic song was the first collaboration between Robić and Bert Kaempfert. Following its success in Germany, the German-language version became a #1 song in Canada and #13 hit on the pop chart (&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) in the United States, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. An English set of lyrics, &quot;One More Sunrise&quot;, bearing no resemblance to the German lyrics, sung by Leslie Uggams, reached #98 on the same charts. It has also been performed by many other artists.

Robić was active in recording for Germany&#x27;s Polydor label. He performed and collaborated with Kaempfert, Freddy Quinn, and Dean Martin. Of the Kaempfert composed international hit of 1966 &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; he sang the Yugoslav and German versions &quot;Stranci u Noći&quot; with lyrics by Marija Renota and &quot;Fremde in der Nacht&quot; with lyrics by Kurt Feltz.

Robić&#x27;s other international hits are &quot;Muli-Song&quot; (1960), &quot;Mit 17 fängt das Leben erst an&quot; (1960), &quot;Ein ganzes Leben lang&quot; (1962), &quot;Rot ist der Wein&quot; (1966), and &quot;Ich zeig&#x27; dir den Sonnenschein&quot; (1971).

<doc id="516661" wikidata="Q2488190" url="?curid=516661" title="Whirlpool Rapids Bridge">
<text>The Whirlpool Rapids Bridge, commonly known as the Whirlpool Bridge or the Lower Steel Arch Bridge (before 1937), is a spandrel braced, riveted, two-hinged arch bridge that crosses the Canada–United States border, connecting the commercial downtown districts of Niagara Falls, Ontario, and Niagara Falls, New York. This bridge is located approximately north of the Rainbow Bridge and about from the Falls. It was acquired by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission in January 1959. Immediately upstream is the similar arch-style Michigan Central Railway Bridge, which has been out of service since 2001.

==History==
The predecessor of the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge was the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge, which carried foot and rail traffic, opened in 1855, and was most notable for being the world&#x27;s first working railway suspension bridge and for being the bridge that was used by abolitionists running the Underground Railroad to get slaves to freedom in Canada. By the late 1800s, the suspension bridge was becoming outdated for railroad needs. The weight of trains in North America had greatly increased by the mid-1890s. Larger and more powerful locomotives were required to pull cars that handled an increasing number of passengers and goods; compared to the locomotives crossing the bridge in the 1850s, locomotives were the common engines 40 years later. The weight of these trains exceeded the specifications of the Suspension Bridge and the bridge companies decided to request the replacement of the bridge.

Civil engineer Leffert L. Buck, who had been hired to maintain the Suspension Bridge, was selected to design the replacement bridge. He settled for a bridge of the arch design. Buck built the new bridge around and below the Suspension Bridge and started building the foundation in April 1896. 
His plan allowed bridge traffic—train and pedestrian—to continue without disruption. By August 27, 1897, the last pieces of the Suspension Bridge were dismantled, leaving the Lower Steel Arch Bridge—later renamed the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge—in its stead. Steel towers and framework supporting the project were removed once it was completed. At the time of completion, it was the longest arch bridge ever built (168 meters across). Bridge materials for the former suspension bridge were then recycled by the Pennsylvania Steel Company.

While the Niagara Cantilever Bridge was nearby, it only served rail traffic for Canada Southern and Michigan Central Railway companies. Over the years, the New York Central Railroad, Great Western Railway, Erie Railroad, Canadian National Railway, and Amtrak have used the whirlpool bridge. In November 2009, the bridge was extensively refurbished: repairing and replacing the catwalk and some of the steel beams and rivets, sandblasting, and a paint job were among the major maintenance tasks undertaken. Amtrak took over maintenance responsibility of the rail deck from Canadian National (CN) in late 2012. Currently the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; train service, jointly operated by Amtrak and Via Rail, is the only train to use the bridge; CN routes freight over the International Railway Bridge at Fort Erie, Ontario–Buffalo, New York instead.

==Bridge setup==
The bridge has two decks. The upper deck carried two tracks worth of railway traffic until 1963 when one of the tracks was removed. The remaining track is used exclusively by Amtrak trains for the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; international train service between Toronto and New York City. The Via Rail Niagara Falls station is immediately located on the Canadian side of the bridge in Niagara Falls, Ontario and the Amtrak Niagara Falls station is immediately located on the American side of the bridge in Niagara Falls, New York.

In 1967, the wood used for the lower deck was replaced with asphalt. This track now only serves passenger vehicles—commercial vehicles and pedestrians are prohibited. Additionally, it may only be used by members of the NEXUS program, jointly operated by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Vehicles entering Canada must pay a $5.00 USD toll electronically using an account linked to their E-ZPass transponder or NEXUS card. There is one lane of traffic to the United States and one lane to Canada, with two inspection lanes at each end for traffic entering the respective countries. The American side connects to New York State Route 104 and New York State Route 182, while the Canadian side connects to the historic terminus of Highway 3A, and , now known as River Road and Bridge Street.

<text>Jeter Connelly Pritchard (July 12, 1857 – April 10, 1921) was a lawyer, newspaperman, United States Senator and a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and of the United States Circuit Courts for the Fourth Circuit and previously was an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Earlier in his political career he served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He was a Republican who was part of the populist fusion political wave before later opposing civil rights for African Americans.

==Early life and education==

Born on July 12, 1857, in Jonesboro, Washington County, Tennessee, He attended the Martins Creek Academy in Tennessee.

==Career==

Pritchard was apprenticed to the printer&#x27;s trade, then moved to Bakersville, Mitchell County, North Carolina, in 1873. He became joint editor and owner of the &quot;Roan Mountain Republican&quot;. He was a Presidential Elector on the Republican Party ticket in North Carolina in 1880.

He read law and was admitted to the bar in 1889. He entered private practice in Marshall, North Carolina, starting in 1889.

==Political career==

He was a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1885 to 1889, and from 1891 to 1893. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1888 and an unsuccessful candidate for United States Senator in 1891. He was President of the North Carolina Protective Tariff League in 1891. He was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives of the 53rd United States Congress in 1892.

==Congressional service==

Pritchard was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1894 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Senator Zebulon Baird Vance. He was reelected in 1897 and served from January 23, 1895, to March 3, 1903. The victory of the Republican-Populist alliance (or &quot;fusion&quot;) in the 1894 legislative elections, and their subsequent domination of the North Carolina General Assembly was the key factor in Pritchard&#x27;s initial election and subsequent reelection. He was Chairman of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment for the 54th and 55th United States Congresses and Chairman of the Committee on Patents for the 56th and 57th United States Congresses.

On October 21, 1898, Pritchard sent a letter to President William McKinley, requesting federal marshals to protect black voters in the upcoming election. He warned that Democrats were stockpiling weapons and threatening black voters, and said that Democrats&#x27; claims of &quot;Negro domination&quot; were without basis. The letter was discussed by McKinley and his cabinet on October 24, but federal marshals were not sent as Governor Daniel Lindsay Russell had not made the request. As a result, intimidation by Red Shirts kept black voters away from the polls, resulting in a sweeping Democratic victory. On the day following the election, the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 broke out.

Pritchard began reversing his views on civil rights in 1900, becoming a lily-white and opposing black officeholders.

==Federal judicial service==

Pritchard was nominated by President Theodore Roosevelt on November 10, 1903, to an Associate Justice seat on the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia (now the United States District Court for the District of Columbia) vacated by Associate Justice Harry M. Clabaugh. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 16, 1903, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on June 1, 1904, due to his elevation to the Fourth Circuit. While in office Pritchard twice offered resolutions demanding that the Senate declare the grandfather clause a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, but both attempts failed.

Pritchard was nominated by President Roosevelt on April 27, 1904, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Fourth Circuit vacated by Judge Charles Henry Simonton. He was confirmed by the Senate on April 27, 1904, and received his commission the same day. On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals. His service terminated on April 10, 1921, due to his death in Asheville, North Carolina. He was interred in the Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, near fellow North Carolina Senators Thomas Lanier Clingman and Zebulon Baird Vance.

==Family==

Senator Pritchard married Augusta L. Ray in 1877 and they became the parents of three sons and a daughter—William D. (an army officer killed in the Philippines in 1904), George M. Pritchard (a politician in the Republican Party), Thomas A., and Ida (Mrs. Thomas S. Rollins). Following the death in 1886 of his wife, Pritchard married Melissa Bowman by whom he had another son, J. McKinley. After the death of his second wife in 1902, Judge Pritchard married Lillian E. Saum in 1903.

==Honor==

Pritchard Park in downtown Asheville is named in Pritchard&#x27;s memory.

<doc id="516670" wikidata="Q1498123" url="?curid=516670" title="Lee S. Overman">
<text>Lee Slater Overman (January 3, 1854December 12, 1930) was a Democratic U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between 1903 and 1930. He was the first US Senator to be elected by popular vote in the state, as the legislature had appointed senators prior to passage of the 17th Amendment to the US Constitution authorizing popular elections of senators. He served as a senator until 1930 when he died when he was two years into his fifth term.

==Early life and education==
Overman was born in Salisbury, North Carolina, the son of William H. and Mary E. Slater Overman. He attended Trinity College (now Duke University), Class of 1874, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity. After he graduated from Trinity College, he taught at Winston-Salem School for two years and then finally earned a Master of Arts from Trinity College.

==Career==
He became very close with Zebulon Baird Vance, who was a leading opponent of Reconstruction. He became one of his personal secretaries when Vance was elected governor, which led him into his life in politics.
Overman became involved in politics and was first elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives.

In 1914, Overman became the first U.S. Senator from North Carolina to be elected by popular vote, after passage of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913 standardized popular election of senators. This was the beginning of his time when he was elected for a second term after his first term of six years had expired. In 1902 and 1909, Overman had been appointed to the Senate seat by the state legislature. The biggest reforms that Overman was in favor of were corporate interests and labor reform. Overman’s economic policies made him lean toward the progressive side.
After the war the senator was active in the investigation of German and Bolshevik propaganda and played a role in bringing on the first Red Scare that plagued American politics in 1919 and 1920. This was after the first World War when many innocent men and women were being called in and taken away from their jobs and lives and brought in for questioning and even jailed at some points. He wanted to keep the Red Scare contained so people would not catch wind of it and live in fear. He wrote and sponsored the Overman Act of 1918, which gave President Woodrow Wilson extraordinary powers to coordinate government agencies in wartime. Overman chaired a Senate committee after World War I to investigate activities during the first Red Scare, which many see as a precursor to the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1922, Overman was one of the leaders of a 1-hour, 45 minute filibuster that helped defeat the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. In his lengthy speech, he said that the bill was a partisan attempt to solidify the Republican hold on the northern Black vote, that the bill had been written by a Black person, and that ignorant Black people in the South would interpret the bill as permission to &quot;commit the foulest of outrages.&quot;

In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS Lee S. Overman was named in his honor. The year after its launch, it struck a mine and sank over the course of a few days.

==Overman Committee==

Overman chaired the Overman Committee, a subcommittee that investigated foreign propaganda and Bolshevism in the United States during the first Red Scare from 1919 to 1921. He was chosen to head the commission called the Overman Committee by President Woodrow Wilson. After the war the senator was active in the investigation of German and Bolshevik propaganda and played a role in bringing on the so-called Red Scare that plagued American politics in 1919 and 1920 (Beaver).

<doc id="516673" wikidata="Q888112" url="?curid=516673" title="Cameron A. Morrison">
<text>Cameron A. Morrison (October 5, 1869August 20, 1953) was an American politician and the 55th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1921 to 1925.

==Early life and career==
He was born in 1869 in Richmond County, North Carolina.

In 1898, Morrison participated in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, a violent coup d&#x27;état by a group of white supremacists. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. The governor of North Carolina, Daniel Lindsay Russell, was forced to flee from Wilmington to Raleigh. Morrison boarded Russell&#x27;s train in Maxton, North Carolina in the company of a small band of Red Shirts and warned Russell that a more hostile band of Red Shirts were waiting at a later stop. He advised Russell to hide in the baggage car to avoid being lynched, which he did.

In 1900, he was elected to the North Carolina Senate for one term.

==Governorship==
With the backing of Sen. Furnifold Simmons and the help of race-baiting tactics employed by A. D. Watts, Morrison defeated O. Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for governor. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee John J. Parker.

Morrison was inaugurated on January 12, 1921. He came to be called &quot;the Good Roads governor&quot; for his support of a modern highway system. Morrison also presided over various reforms and pushed for increased funds for public education, while also battling the teaching of the theory of evolution.

==Later career==
He was later appointed to serve as a United States senator for the state of North Carolina (after the death of Lee S. Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds.

Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey. He died in Quebec City in 1953.

==Personal life==
Morrison was married twice. His first wife, Lottie May Tomlinson, gave birth to four children but only one, Angelia Lawrance Morrison, survived infancy. Tomlinson died in 1919.

In 1924, while serving as governor, Morrison married a second time to Sara Virginia Ecker Watts, the widow of George Washington Watts. Their wedding ceremony was held at Harwood Hall. With his second wife, Morrison built Morrocroft, a large estate in Charlotte.

==Legacy==
A ten-story residence hall on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is named in Morrison&#x27;s honor. His home at Charlotte, Morrocroft, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

A library in Charlotte was named after Morrison, but was renamed in 2020 due to Morrison&#x27;s ties with the Red Shirts and white supremacy. A residence hall at North Carolina A&amp;T State University was also named after Morrison, but the name was removed in 2020.

<doc id="516680" wikidata="Q215328" url="?curid=516680" title="Excited state">
<text>In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation refers to an increase in energy level above a chosen starting point, usually the ground state, but sometimes an already excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).

The lifetime of a system in an excited state is usually short: spontaneous or induced emission of a quantum of energy (such as a photon or a phonon) usually occurs shortly after the system is promoted to the excited state, returning the system to a state with lower energy (a less excited state or the ground state). This return to a lower energy level is known as de-excitation and is the inverse of excitation.

Long-lived excited states are often called metastable. Long-lived nuclear isomers and singlet oxygen are two examples of this.

== Atomic excitation ==
Atoms can be excited by heat, electricity, or light. The hydrogen atom provides a simple example of this concept.

The ground state of the hydrogen atom has the atom&#x27;s single electron in the lowest possible orbital (that is, the spherically symmetric &quot;1s&quot; wave function, which, so far, has been demonstrated to have the lowest possible quantum numbers). By giving the atom additional energy (for example, by absorption of a photon of an appropriate energy), the electron moves into an excited state (one with one or more quantum numbers greater than the minimum possible). When the electron finds itself between two states—a shift which happens very fast—it&#x27;s in a superposition of both states. If the photon has too much energy, the electron will cease to be bound to the atom, and the atom will become ionized.

After excitation the atom may return to the ground state or a lower excited state, by emitting a photon with a characteristic energy. Emission of photons from atoms in various excited states leads to an electromagnetic spectrum showing a series of characteristic emission lines (including, in the case of the hydrogen atom, the Lyman, Balmer, Paschen and Brackett series).

An atom in a high excited state is termed a Rydberg atom. A system of highly excited atoms can form a long-lived condensed excited state, Rydberg matter.

== Perturbed gas excitation ==
A collection of molecules forming a gas can be considered in an excited state if one or more molecules are elevated to kinetic energy levels such that the resulting velocity distribution departs from the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution. This phenomenon has been studied in the case of a two-dimensional gas in some detail, analyzing the time taken to relax to equilibrium.

== Calculation of excited states ==
Excited states are often calculated using coupled cluster, Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, multi-configurational self-consistent field, configuration interaction, and time-dependent density functional theory.

==Excited-state absorption==
The excitation of a system (an atom or molecule) from one excited state to a higher-energy excited state with the absorption of a photon is called &quot;excited-state absorption&quot; (ESA). Excited-state absorption is possible only when an electron has been already excited from the ground state to a lower excited state. The excited-state absorption is usually an undesired effect, but it can be useful in upconversion pumping. Excited-state absorption measurements are done using pump–probe techniques such as flash photolysis. However, it is not easy to measure them compared to ground-state absorption, and in some cases complete bleaching of the ground state is required to measure excited-state absorption.

==Reaction==

A further consequence of excited-state formation may be reaction of the atom or molecule in its excited state, as in photochemistry.

<doc id="516683" wikidata="Q5228497" url="?curid=516683" title="Dave Carter">
<text>Dave Carter (August 13, 1952 July 19, 2002) was an American folk music singer-songwriter who described his style as &quot;post-modern mythic American folk music&quot;. He was one half of the duo Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer, who were heralded as the new &quot;voice of modern folk music&quot; in the months before Carter&#x27;s unexpected death in July 2002. They were ranked as number one on the year-end list for &quot;Top Artists&quot; on the &quot;Folk Music Radio Airplay Chart&quot; for 2001 and 2002, and their popularity has endured in the years following Carter&#x27;s death. Joan Baez, who went on tour with the duo in 2002, spoke of Carter&#x27;s songs in the same terms that she once used to promote a young Bob Dylan:
&quot;There is a special gift for writing songs that are available to other people, and Dave&#x27;s songs are very available to me. It&#x27;s a kind of genius, you know, and Dylan has the biggest case of it. But I hear it in Dave&#x27;s songs, too.
Carter&#x27;s songs were often noted for their poetic imagery, spirituality and storytelling while retaining connection to the country music of his southern American upbringing. Carter&#x27;s memory has been kept alive by his many admirers, most notably his former partner. Tracy Grammer has continued to introduce previously unrecorded songs and recordings that the duo were working on prior to Carter&#x27;s death.

== Early life and education ==
Dave Carter was born in Oxnard, California. His father was a mathematician and a petroleum engineer and his mother was a science teacher and a charismatic Christian. Carter was raised in Oklahoma and Texas and would draw on his rural upbringing in many of his songs. He studied classical piano from age 4 to about age 12, when he took up guitar. At 17, he left home to hitchhike around the country, especially the Midwestern United States (Great Plains area). After graduating with degrees in music (cello) and fine arts from the University of Oklahoma, Carter moved to Portland, Oregon, where he continued his education at Portland State University, earning a degree in mathematics. He began an advanced degree in mathematics, but a personal epiphany led him to realize that this was not to be his field. He went on to study what he called &quot;the psychology of mystical experience&quot; at the Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in Palo Alto and the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, and worked as an embedded systems programmer for several years before taking up music full-time in the mid-1990s. Carter was greatly influenced by mythologist Joseph Campbell, who visited his college, and American mystic Carlos Castaneda. He was also influenced by the American landscape, Arthurian mythology, the environment, and transcendental psychology.

== Partnership with Tracy Grammer ==
Prior to his death, Carter released three albums with Grammer: &quot;When I Go&quot; (1998); &quot;Tanglewood Tree&quot; (2000); and &quot;Drum Hat Buddha&quot; (2001). The duo re-recorded many of the songs from &quot;Snake Handlin&#x27; Man&quot;, plus two previously unrecorded songs, in early 2002. The CD, called &quot;Seven Is the Number&quot;, was released by Tracy Grammer in 2006. A collection of the duo&#x27;s holiday recordings called &quot;American Noel&quot; was compiled by Tracy Grammer and released in 2008 by Signature Sounds. In 2012, Grammer partnered with Red House Records to release &quot;Little Blue Egg&quot; and a limited-edition companion EP, &quot;Joy My Love&quot;, which included previously-unpublished recordings and rare demos from the duo&#x27;s home studio.

== Transgender identity ==
In 2000 Carter revealed to Grammer that he had struggled with gender dysphoria since his early teen years. Grammer later said, &quot;... he was exploring a gender change and that altered the dynamics of our off-stage relationship. It actually made things quite difficult for us personally, but anyone on the outside would not have known that. It was just a process that we were going through and that, thankfully, we reconciled with by the time he died.&quot;

Of this timeframe, Grammer said: &quot;... We even had a whole plan for the unveiling. He was going to release one more manly ‘Cowboy Dave’ album, and I would introduce myself as a solo artist. Then he would go change and we would come back as an all-girl band, calling ourselves The Butterfly Conservatory. He would be she and that would be that.&quot;

== Death and tributes ==
Carter died of a massive heart attack on July 19, 2002, in a hotel room in Hadley, Massachusetts after returning from an early morning run. He and Grammer were slated to play that weekend at the Green River Festival in Greenfield and were booked that summer to play many of the nation&#x27;s top folk festivals and folk clubs. He was 49. Carter&#x27;s death came as a great shock to the folk music community. Tracy Grammer gave her account of Carter&#x27;s final moments in a letter to fans: &quot;Yesterday, shortly after he went unconscious, he came back for a lucid minute or two to tell me, &#x27;I just died... Baby, I just died...&#x27; There was a look of wonder in his eyes, and though I cried and tried to deny it to him, I knew he was right and he was on his way. He stayed with me a minute more but despite my attempts to keep him with me, I could see he was already riding that thin chiffon wave between here and gone. He loved beauty, he was hopelessly drawn to the magic and the light in all things. I figure he saw something he could not resist out of the corner of his eye and flew into it. Despite the fact that every rescue attempt was made by paramedics and hospital staff and the death pronouncement officially came at 12:08 pm Eastern Time, I believe he died in my arms in our favorite hotel, leaving me with those final words. That&#x27;s the true story I am going to tell.&quot;

Many had predicted that the duo was destined for success beyond the typical folk music circles. Jim Olsen, president of Carter&#x27;s record label, Signature Sounds, said, &quot;I always believed it would only take one cover by a major star to unveil his work to the rest of the world; and I was convinced that was going to happen. Somebody was going to open the door for them; and the thing about Dave&#x27;s music is that once people heard it, they became lifelong fans.&quot; Fellow folksinger and journalist Matt Watroba wrote, &quot;It would make sense at this point to say that Dave Carter was on the verge of something big. The truth, however, is that Dave was something big already. He moved the people lucky enough to know him or his music in a way that has launched an outpouring of tributes, memories and love.&quot;

Grammer decided to keep the duo&#x27;s appointment to play the 2002 Falcon Ridge Folk Festival the following week and a tribute concert was arranged. The tribute included performances by a number of Carter&#x27;s admirers singing his songs. Highlights included Chris Smither&#x27;s cover of &quot;Crocodile Man&quot;, Mark Erelli singing &quot;Cowboy Singer&quot;, a rendition of &quot;Happytown&quot; by The Kennedys, and &quot;Farewell to Saint Dolores&quot; by Eddie From Ohio. Grammer herself opened the show with &quot;The Mountain&quot; and closed with &quot;Gentle Soldier of My Soul&quot;. Several artists have since written tributes in Carter&#x27;s honor and in 2005 Grammer released &quot;Flower of Avalon&quot;, including nine previously unrecorded songs by Carter.

== Songwriting ==
Dave Carter&#x27;s songs have been covered by many others, most notably by Judy Collins and Willie Nelson (&quot;When I Go&quot;), Joan Baez (&quot;The Mountain&quot;), Lucy Kaplansky (&quot;Cowboy Singer&quot;) and Chris Smither (&quot;Crocodile Man&quot;). Tributes to Dave following his death were written by Tracy Grammer (&quot;The Verdant Mile&quot;) and Richard Shindell (&quot;So Says the Whippoorwill&quot;), among others.

One song, &quot;Gentle Arms of Eden&quot;, was added to the hymnal in at least one Unitarian Universalist congregation. More of Carter&#x27;s songs were recorded by Tracy Grammer on her 2005 album &quot;Flower of Avalon&quot;.

Dave Carter was the first winner of the songwriting contest held at Sisters Folk Festival in 1995. In 2005 the contest took his name, becoming the Dave Carter Memorial Songwriting Contest, to honor both his initial victory and his advocacy of the festival in the subsequent years. Carter is listed among the winners of the 1998 edition of the Kerrville New Folk Songwriting Competition. He also won the 1998 edition of the Wildflower Performing Songwriter Award and the Napa Valley Folk Festival Emerging Songwriter Award.

<doc id="516684" wikidata="Q1456676" url="?curid=516684" title="Robert R. Reynolds">
<text>Robert Rice Reynolds (June 18, 1884 – February 13, 1963) was an American politician who served as a Democratic US senator from North Carolina from 1932 to 1945. Almost from the outset of his Senate career, &quot;Our Bob,&quot; as he was known among his local supporters, acquired distinction as a passionate isolationist and increasing notoriety as an apologist for Nazi aggression in Europe. Even after America&#x27;s entry into World War II, according to a contemporary study of subversive elements in America, he &quot;publicly endorsed the propaganda efforts of Gerald L. K. Smith,&quot; whose scurrilous publication &quot;The Cross and the Flag&quot; &quot;violently assailed the United States war effort and America&#x27;s allies.&quot; One of the nation&#x27;s most influential fascists, Smith likewise collaborated with Reynolds on &quot;The Defender&quot;, an antisemitic newspaper that was partly owned by Reynolds.

Reynolds occasionally turned over his Senate office facilities to subversive propagandists and allowed them to use his franking to mail their literature postage-free.

==Early life==
He was born on June 18, 1884, in Asheville, North Carolina, at his family&#x27;s estate, the Reynolds House. He was the son of William Taswell Reynolds (1850–1892) and Mamie Elizabeth Spears (1862–1939). He was descended from a family of Revolutionary War heroes and pioneers, politicians, and property owners, including his maternal great-grandfather, Colonel Daniel Smith, a Revolutionary War hero of the Battle of Kings Mountain. His siblings included George Spears Reynolds (1881–1924) and Jane Reynolds Wood (1888–1927).

Reynolds attended public and private schools, including Weaver College, a preparatory school, before entering the University of North Carolina. While at UNC, he played football, ran track, and was the editor of the sports section of &quot;The Daily Tar Heel&quot;. He left UNC without a degree but was still accepted at the University of North Carolina School of Law. He did not officially enroll but attended lectures and was eventually admitted to the Bar in North Carolina in 1908.

==Early career==
After passing the bar exam, Reynolds began practicing in Asheville with his brother. He was elected prosecuting attorney, serving from 1910 to 1914, and during World War I, registered for military service. He was never drafted but briefly served in the National Guard. In 1924, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, losing to J. Elmer Long in the Democratic primary.

In 1926, Reynolds first ran for the US Senate, but was unsuccessful and lost the primary to Lee Overman. He ran again in 1932 and defeated former Governor and interim Senator Cameron Morrison in the Democratic primary runoff by nearly two-to-one after running a particularly nasty, populist campaign in which he accused Morrison of being a Communist sympathizer. During one campaign speech, he proclaimed, &quot;Cam likes fish eggs, and Red Russian fish eggs at that. Don&#x27;t you want a Senator who likes North Carolina hen eggs?&quot;

==U.S. Senate==
In his first term, Reynolds was in favor of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and believed that it provided much-needed jobs for his North Carolinans. That allowed the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to be built. Reynolds favored taxing the wealthy and imposing regulations on the economy. In addition, he supported Social Security, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Works Progress Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which raised tobacco prices. Reynolds initially supported Roosevelt&#x27;s Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 to pack the Supreme Court but later joined other Democrats in sending it back to the Judiciary Committee, effectively killing the bill.

Reynolds was an advocate of &quot;Fortress America&quot; and supported a strong national defense, including an expansion of the United States Armed Forces. However, he was also a leading isolationist. He vociferously opposed Roosevelt&#x27;s efforts to revise the Neutrality Acts. Reynolds and Senator John Overton of Louisiana were the only senators from the South to vote against the repeal of the arms embargo. Therefore, during his 1938 re-election campaign, Roosevelt recruited Congressman Franklin W. Hancock, Jr. to oppose Reynolds in the Democratic primary, but Reynolds won handily.

An advocate of immigration restriction, Reynolds spoke out against the Wagner–Rogers Bill that aimed to accept 20,000 Jewish refugee children into the United States from Nazi Germany. He elicited the praise of the magazine &quot;Social Justice&quot;, organized by demagogue and radio priest Charles Coughlin.

In 1939, less than three months before the beginning of World War II, Reynolds, described by the leftist newspaper PM as &quot;the Senate&#x27;s No. 1 alien-baiter,&quot; called for a 10-year ban on all immigration to the United States and said that &quot;the time has come for changing the tradition that the U.S.A. is an asylum for the oppressed.&quot; He also demanded that newly-arrived immigrants, &quot;millions of foreigners who are about to begin the rape of this country,&quot; should be deported or detained in concentration camps.

Unusually for a major American politician, Reynolds openly praised Nazi Germany and worked with fascist intellectuals such as Gerald L. K. Smith and George Sylvester Viereck. In 1941, Reynolds became chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. After the Pearl Harbor attack and the German declaration of war against the United States in December 1941, he partially reversed his pro-German and pro-fascist opinions and introduced a bill to extend the Selective Training and Service Act sponsored by the U.S. War Department. Nevertheless, a confidential 1943 analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Isaiah Berlin for the British Foreign Office stated that Reynolds

By 1944, the Democratic Party chose former Governor Clyde R. Hoey to seek Reynolds&#x27;s seat in the primary. As a result, Reynolds did not seek reelection. Hoey won the primary and went on to win the general election in a landslide victory over a Republican opponent. Reynolds sought to return to the Senate in 1950, but he was by then hopelessly discredited and won only 10% in the Democratic primary, behind Frank Porter Graham and Willis Smith.

==Later life==
After leaving public life, Reynolds practiced law and real estate until his death, in Asheville. He wrote the book &quot;Gypsy Trails, Around the World in an Automobile&quot;; Asheville, NC: Advocate Publishing Company (presumed date 1923).

==Personal life==
Reynolds married five times throughout his life and had four children. His first marriage was in 1910 to Frances Jackson (1889–1913). Before her death from typhoid fever in 1913, they had two children together:
* Frances Jackson Reynolds (1910–1955)
* Robert Rice Reynolds, Jr. (1913–1950)
In 1914, he married 17-year-old Mary Bland (b. 1897). Less than a year after their marriage, he left his new wife and their child. Before their divorce in 1917 and her three subsequent marriages, they had one daughter together:
* Mary Bland Reynolds, who died of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease.

In 1921, he married, for the third time, Denise D&#x27;Arcy, a French woman he met in New York. Reynolds met D&#x27;Arcy while he was traveling around the country in his truck and accidentally struck her as she crossed the street. Within five days, he had announced that they had fallen in love and were going to get married. The marriage dissolved after one year, and D&#x27;Arcy obtained a legal separation from Reynolds in 1922 and moved back to France. The divorce was ultimately finalized in 1929.

On February 27, 1931, he married for the fourth time to Eva Brady (1898–1934), a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer from Chicago, who came to Asheville looking for a cure for tuberculosis. Eva died on December 13, 1934.

On October 9, 1941, 57-year-old Reynolds married for the fifth and final time to 19-year-old Evalyn Washington McLean (1921–1946), daughter of Edward B. McLean, the former publisher and owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and Evalyn Walsh McLean, owner of the Hope Diamond. Together, they had one daughter:
* Mamie Spears Reynolds (1942–2014), an owner and driver for the Reynolds Racing Team of Asheville, the first woman to qualify for the Daytona 500, and co-owner of the ABA Kentucky Colonels professional basketball team. In 1963, she married Luigi &quot;Coco&quot; Chinetti Jr., son of Italian racecar driver and Ferrari agent Luigi Chinetti, and divorced two years later.
On September 20, 1946, his wife, Evalyn, died of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills, which some believe is a result of the Hope Diamond curse..

==Death==
Reynolds died of cancer on February 13, 1963, at Reynolds House, in Asheville.

<doc id="516704" wikidata="Q962398" url="?curid=516704" title="Cadwallon ap Cadfan">
<text>Cadwallon ap Cadfan (died 634) was the King of Gwynedd from around 625 until his death in battle. The son and successor of Cadfan ap Iago, he is best remembered as the King of the Britons who invaded and conquered Northumbria, defeating and killing its king, Edwin, prior to his own death in battle against Oswald of Bernicia. His conquest of Northumbria, which he held for a year or two after Edwin died, made him one of the last recorded Celtic Britons to hold substantial territory in eastern Britain until the rise of the Welsh House of Tudor. He was thereafter remembered as a national hero by the Britons and as a tyrant by the Anglo-Saxons of Northumbria.

== History ==
As with other figures of the era, little is certainly known of Cadwallon&#x27;s early life or reign. The primary source of information about him is the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; of the Anglo-Saxon writer Bede, who is strongly critical of him. Cadwallon consistently appears in the genealogies of the Kings of Gwynedd as the son of Cadfan ap Iago and a descendant of Maelgwn Gwynedd and Cunedda. Historian Alex Woolf, however, presents the case that the genealogists have erroneously inserted Bede&#x27;s Cadwallon into the pedigree of the unrelated Kings of Gwynedd as son of Cadfan. Instead, Woolf suggests that Bede&#x27;s Cadwallon was the &quot;Catguallaun liu&quot; found in genealogies as son of &quot;Guitcun&quot; and grandson of Sawyl Penuchel, rulers in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; or Brythonic-speaking area of northern Britain.

Cadwallon was affected by the ambitions of Edwin, King of Northumbria. Bede, writing about a century after Cadwallon&#x27;s death, describes Edwin, the most powerful king in Britain, conquering the Brittonic kingdom of Elmet (now western Yorkshire) and ejecting its king, Cerdic. This opened the door to the Irish Sea, and Edwin successfully extended his rule to the &quot;Mevanian Islands&quot; – the Isle of Man and Anglesey. The &quot;Annales Cambriae&quot; says that Cadwallon was besieged at Glannauc (now Puffin Island, a small island off eastern Anglesey), and dates this to 629. Surviving Welsh poetry and the Welsh Triads portray Cadwallon as a heroic leader against Edwin. They refer to a battle at Digoll (Long Mountain) and mention that Cadwallon spent time in Ireland before returning to Britain to defeat Edwin.

According to Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (which includes a fairly extensive account of Cadwallon&#x27;s life but is largely legendary — for example, Geoffrey has Cadwallon surviving until after the Battle of the Winwaed in 654 or 655), Cadwallon went to Ireland and then to the island of Guernsey. From there, according to Geoffrey, Cadwallon led an army into Dumnonia, where he encountered and defeated the Mercians besieging Exeter, and forced their king, Penda of Mercia, into an alliance. Geoffrey also reports that Cadwallon married a half-sister of Penda.

Penda and Cadwallon together waged war against the Northumbrians. The Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633 ended in the defeat and death of Edwin and his son Osfrith. After this, the Kingdom of Northumbria fell into disarray, divided between its sub-kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia, but the war continued: according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, &quot;Cadwallon and Penda went and did for the whole land of Northumbria&quot;. Bede says that Cadwallon was besieged by the new king of Deira, Osric, &quot;in a strong town&quot;; Cadwallon, however, &quot;sallied out on a sudden with all his forces, by surprise, and destroyed him [Osric] and all his army.&quot;

After this, according to Bede, Cadwallon ruled over the &quot;provinces of the Northumbrians&quot; for a year, &quot;not like a victorious king, but like a rapacious and bloody tyrant.&quot; Furthermore, Bede tells us that Cadwallon, &quot;though he bore the name and professed himself a Christian, was so barbarous in his disposition and behaviour, that he neither spared the female sex, nor the innocent age of children, but with savage cruelty put them to tormenting deaths, ravaging all their country for a long time, and resolving to cut off all the race of the English within the borders of Britain.&quot; Bede&#x27;s extremely negative portrayal of Cadwallon as a genocidal tyrant cannot be taken at face value. Cadwallon&#x27;s alliance with the Anglo-Saxon Penda undermines Bede&#x27;s assertion that Cadwallon had attempted to exterminate the English. Additionally, the fact that Cædwalla of Wessex a generation after Cadwallon&#x27;s death bore a name derived directly from the British &quot;Cadwallon&quot; suggests that Cadwallon&#x27;s reputation could not have been so poor among the Saxons of Wessex as it was in Northumbria.

The new king of Bernicia, Eanfrith, was also killed by Cadwallon when the former went to him in an attempt to negotiate peace. However, Cadwallon was defeated by an army under Eanfrith&#x27;s brother, Oswald, at the Battle of Heavenfield, &quot;though he had most numerous forces, which he boasted nothing could withstand&quot;. Cadwallon was killed at a place called &quot;Denis&#x27;s-brook&quot;.

<text>Cecily April Adams (February 6, 1958 – March 3, 2004) was an American actress.

==Early life==
Adams was born in Jamaica, Queens, New York City, the daughter of comic actor Don Adams and singer Adelaide Efantis. Her siblings included her brother Sean, and her sisters Carolyn Steele, Christine Adams, Cathy Metchik, Paramount TV executive Stacey Adams and Beige Adams. She attended Beverly Hills High School, where she participated in acting, an activity she continued at the University of California at Irvine.

==Career==
Adams studied improvisational comedy at the Groundlings and was a member of the Acme Comedy Theater in Los Angeles. She was also an acting coach.

Adams portrayed the recurring character of Ishka (also known as &quot;Moogie&quot;), mother of the Ferengi brothers Rom and Quark, in four of her five appearances in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, replacing Andrea Martin. Adams was, in fact, nine years younger than Armin Shimerman, who played Quark, despite playing his mother.

She appeared in guest roles on a variety of television series, including &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, and &quot;Party of Five&quot;, and with her father in his television series &quot;Check It Out!&quot; and television movie &quot;Get Smart Again&quot;. Adams played a lead role in the 1991 independent feature film &quot;Little Secrets&quot;.

Adams was also a lyricist, and with her collaborator, David Burke wrote pop songs and commercial jingles and television theme songs.

Adams worked in casting TV series such as &quot;3rd Rock From the Sun&quot; and &quot;Eerie, Indiana&quot;, and features including &quot;American Heart&quot; (1992) and &quot;Home Room&quot; (2002). Until her death, she served as casting director for &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;.

==Personal life==
Adams married actor/writer Jim Beaver in 1989; their daughter was born in 2001. Adams, though a non-smoker, died of lung cancer on March 3, 2004, at the age of 46, in Los Angeles, California. Her husband&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Life&#x27;s That Way&quot;, details her last few months. She was cremated and her ashes scattered at Fern Canyon in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, California, and at Franklin Canyon Park in Beverly Hills, California.

<text>The Conservative Order was the period in political history of Europe after the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. From 1815 to 1830, a conscious program by conservative statesmen, including Metternich and Castlereagh, was put into place to contain revolution and revolutionary forces by restoring the old orders, particularly the previously-ruling aristocracies. On the other hand, in South America, in light of the Monroe Doctrine, the Spanish and the Portuguese colonies gained independence.

Britain, Prussia, Russia and Austria renewed their commitment to prevent any restoration of Bonapartist power and agreed to meet regularly in conferences to discuss their common interests. The period contained the time of the Holy Alliance, a military agreement. The Concert of Europe was the political framework that grew out of the Quadruple Alliance in November 1815.

The Conservative Order had as its main aim to stay in power and regarded the widespread nationalism to be a threat to the aristocracy.

==Congress of Vienna==
In March 1814 the military coalition of Napoleon&#x27;s four major opponents (United Kingdom, Austria, Prussia and Russia) had agreed to remain united not only to defeat France but also to ensure peace after the war. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, the alliance restored the Bourbon monarchy to France and agreed to meet in Vienna, Austria, in September 1814 to arrange a settlement, a meeting that would become known as the Congress of Vienna.

The conservatives&#x27; goal at the meeting, led by Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria, was said to be to re-establish peace in Europe. Metternich and the other four states sought to do so by restoring the old ruling families and to create buffer zones between the major powers. To contain the still-powerful French, the House of Orange-Nassau was put onto the throne in the Netherlands in what had been the Dutch Republic and the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium). Southeast of France, Piedmont (officially part of the Kingdom of Sardinia) was enlarged. The Bourbon dynasty was restored to France and to Spain as well as a return of other former rulers to the Italian states. To contain the Russian empire, Poland was divided up between Austria, Prussia and Russia. Austria and Prussia were allowed to keep some of their Polish territories, and a new nominally-independent Polish kingdom was established, with the Romanov dynasty of Russia as its hereditary monarchs. Also, the German Confederation was created to replace the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine.

During the Congress of Vienna, Napoleon escaped from Elba and launched his unsuccessful &quot;Hundred Days&quot;. That ultimately did not disrupt the meeting but as a punishment to the French for allowing Napoleon back in power, they were forced to pay an indemnity, accept an army of occupation for five years and have France&#x27;s borders returned to those of 1790.

==Conservative Ideology==
The Congress of Vienna was only the beginning of the conservative reaction bent on containing the liberal and nationalist forces unleashed by the French Revolution. Metternich and most of the other participants at the Congress of Vienna were representatives of an ideology known as conservatism, which generally dates back to 1790, when its best-known figure, Edmund Burke, wrote &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot;. Burke, however, was not the only kind of conservative. Joseph de Maistre was a very influential spokesperson for a counterrevolutionary and authoritarian conservatism and believed in hereditary monarchies because they would bring &quot;order to society,&quot; a commodity in short supply in his eyes after the chaos of the French Revolution. Despite their differences, most conservatives held to some general principles and beliefs:

*Obedience to political authority
*The centrality of organized religion to social order
*Opposition to revolutionary upheavals
*Unwillingness to accept liberal demands for civil liberties and representative government and nationalistic aspirations generated by the French Revolutionary era
*Precedence of community over individual rights
*Structured and ordered society
*Tradition as a guide for an ordered society

Many conservatives such as Metternich were not opposed to reforming governments but said that such changes must be taken gradually and that radical revolutions are aimed, rather than at benefiting the masses, as simply power grabs by the new middle class.

After 1815, the political philosophy of conservatism was supported by hereditary monarchs, government bureaucracies, landowning aristocracies and revived churches (Protestant or Catholic). The conservative forces appeared dominant after 1815 both internationally and domestically.

== Demise (1830-1848) ==
The first liberal reaction against the Conservative Order manifested itself in the Revolutions of the 1820s, where Liberal groups started multiple insurrections against absolute monarchies in Portugal, Spain, Italy, the Ottoman Empire (Greece) and the Russian Empire. While the Revolutions had limited success in Portugal (where a constitutional monarchy was instated) and Greece (which became independent from the Ottoman Empire), they were largely crushed in other European countries, resulting in a victory for the Conservative Order.

The Revolutions of 1830 were the first step to the demise of the Conservative Order: in France, the autocratic King Charles X was forced to abdicate and replaced with the liberal Louis Philippe I and a constitutional monarchy was created, while Belgium gained independence from the Netherlands, also becoming a constitutional monarchy. The Revolutions of 1848, while not completely successful, saw the demise of the Conservative Order.

<doc id="516739" wikidata="Q2936583" url="?curid=516739" title="Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs">
<text>The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs are an Australian professional rugby league club based in Belmore, a suburb in the Canterbury-Bankstown region of Sydney. They compete in the NRL Telstra Premiership, as well as competitions facilitated by the New South Wales Rugby League, including the NSW Cup, the Jersey Flegg Cup, NSWRL Women&#x27;s Premiership, Tarsha Gale Cup, S. G. Ball Cup and the Harold Matthews Cup.

The club was admitted to the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership, predecessor of the current NRL competition, in 1935. They won their first premiership in their fourth year of competition with another soon after, and after spending the 1950s and most of the 1960s on the lower rungs went through a very strong period in the 1980s, winning four premierships in that decade. The club won the first National premiership in 1995, but would defect to Super League in 1997 during the Super League war. They would return in 1998 for the first NRL season, where they have played since.

Known in 1995 as the Sydney Bulldogs, they reverted to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs until 1999 before changing their name to the geographically indistinct The Bulldogs before reverting again in 2009 to their current name. The club has won 8 premierships, with their most recent premiership in 2004. In 2012, they won their most recent minor premiership. They last played in a Grand Final in 2014 losing to South Sydney. They are commonly referred to as Canterbury, the Bulldogs or just the Dogs.

==History==
In 1935—thirteen years after a meeting above &quot;The Ideal Milk Bar&quot; in Campsie led to the creation of the Canterbury-Bankstown Junior Rugby League—the Canterbury club was admitted into the elite New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership. It took the new club, nicknamed &quot;Country Bumpkins&quot; because of their rural recruiting and CB emblem, four years to win their first premiership in 1938. The grand final-winning effort was repeated in 1942 before a 38-year premiership drought.

In 1967, having ended the 11-year premiership reign of St. George by defeating them in the final, &quot;The Berries&quot; (as they were known at the time) lost to South Sydney in the grand final. But the return to the top end of the table set the scene for off-field restructuring that laid the foundations for the club to become one of the most consistent achievers in the remaining decades of the 20th century.

In 1978, Canterbury became known as &quot;The Bulldogs&quot;. Nicknames such as &quot;Cantabs&quot; &quot;CBs&quot; and &quot;Berries&quot; were seen to be &quot;soft&quot; and the club wanted something to signify determination and grit. The new name and logo was purchased from a local Sydney Liquor Store owner Bill Caralis. A grand final appearance in 1979, followed by a grand final win in 1980 with a young, enthusiastic and free-running side dubbed &quot;The Entertainers&quot;, was the beginning of a golden era that was to produce three more grand final wins in the 1980s: 1984, 1985 and 1988.
During the mid-1990s&#x27; Super League war, Canterbury aligned themselves with the Super League competition, playing in the 1997 premiership season. In 1998 the Bulldogs came close to adding another premiership trophy after qualifying for the grand final where they met the Brisbane Broncos and lost 38–12. On the way to the 1998 Grand Final, Canterbury had two come-from-behind wins. The first was against the Newcastle Knights in the third week of the finals—behind 16–0 in the second half, they fought back to 16 all at full time and went on to win in extra time. A week later they trailed arch rivals Parramatta in the preliminary final by 16 points with 9 minutes remaining. Three tries and a conversion from the sideline by Daryl Halligan in the final minutes got them back level at 18 all and send the game into extra-time. Canterbury eventually went on to win 32–20 in one of the greatest finals comebacks in the history of the game.
Following indifferent form in 1999, 2000 and 2001 where they had varying levels of success, the club was found to have systematically and deliberately breached the NRL salary cap in 2002 (for the 2001–02 seasons), and was penalised all 37 competition points which it had amassed up to that point for 2002. This resulted in the club falling from first to last place on the ladder, and at the end of the season the Bulldogs received their first &quot;wooden spoon&quot; (a reference to the club which finishes last in the competition) since 1964.

The Bulldogs returned to finals contention in 2003; however, they fell one step short of yet another grand final after losing to the Roosters 28–18 in the preliminary final.

The club went through some off-field dramas in 2004, the most serious of which included rape allegations during a pre-season match in Coffs Harbour. The team managed to focus on football and triumphed when they held out the Sydney Roosters 16–13 with a try-saving tackle by Andrew Ryan in the dying seconds of the 2004 Grand Final. The game was to be the last for departing captain Steve Price, but he missed the match due to a leg injury. Price is now taking over at the club as the General Manager of Football, this position becoming effective in 2020 as he looks to turn the club&#x27;s fortunes around to that of 2004.

2005 saw Canterbury-Bankstown unable to mount a serious defence of their premiership title as injuries and contract negotiations saw the year start and finish on a sour note for the club. Due to the extent of injuries suffered, the team was under-strength for most of the year. This took its toll in the final six weeks of the season, with the club suffering successive heavy losses and missing the finals series. In 2006, little was expected from the club after a poor 2005 season, but despite some doubt over the strength of their side, Canterbury&#x27;s forward pack helped them to a better than expected result for the year, finishing a game short of the grand final, losing to eventual premiers the Brisbane Broncos. Inconsistency and a poor finish to the 2007 season meant Canterbury were knocked out of the finals in week two.

In 2008, having already lost Mark O&#x27;Meley to the Sydney Roosters, Willie Mason left the club. Further into the off-season Canterbury-Bankstown also lost halfback Brent Sherwin, and prospects for the 2008 NRL season began to look dim. Although they recorded at the start of the season a couple of victories, the injury toll and the departure Sonny Bill Williams mid-season demoralised the club and players, and the Canterbury-Bankstown club earned their second wooden spoon of the decade.

Another source of discontent in 2008 was the battle for election to the football club board. Many contenders believed that the board of the time was steering the club in the wrong direction, particularly then-CEO Malcolm Noad. New members were elected to the board early in 2008, and later in the season Noad resigned as CEO. His replacement as head of the football club was Todd Greenberg.

Greenberg&#x27;s influence became apparent during the 2009 season. Premiership-winning coach Steve Folkes was replaced with his assistant Kevin Moore. The purchases of several key players, including former Melbourne and Cronulla playmaker Brett Kimmorley changed Canterbury from a poorly run and poorly performing club to one of the best clubs both on and off the field in 2009. Canterbury finished second in the regular season (losing the minor premiership to the St. George Illawarra Dragons due to a loss of two competition points for an interchange breach against Penrith in Round 2), and players and officials took out a number of Dally M awards. 2009 was also the final season for Hazem El Masri, who became the highest all-time pointscorer in Australian rugby league history with a penalty goal in the Bulldogs&#x27; Round 1 match against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.

From 2010, Canterbury-Bankstown returned to the name Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. The Canterbury-Bankstown club celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010.

In the 2012 NRL season, Canterbury finished first on the competition ladder to take out their first minor premiership since 1994. They made it to the grand final, losing to Melbourne 14–4.

In May 2013, former Netball New Zealand chief executive Raelene Castle was appointed CEO, the first female in the NRL&#x27;s history. They finished the regular season sixth on the ladder and bowed out in the semi-final.

In 2014, Canterbury-Bankstown made history by winning three consecutive games by one point, from Round 5 to Round 7. They finished runners up to South Sydney in the 2014 NRL Grand Final. Canterbury reached the grand final after winning three sudden death finals matches against Melbourne, Manly-Warringah and Penrith.

On 10 August 2017, Canterbury announced Rugby League World Cup CEO Andrew Hill as the replacement for outgoing boss Raelene Castle. On the appointment, chairman Ray Dib noted that &quot;Andrew was appointed from a very strong list of candidates and has exceptional experience in the game of rugby league.&quot;

In September 2017, Canterbury announced that former premiership winning player Dean Pay would be the new coach at the club starting in 2018.

The 2018 NRL season started off badly for Canterbury with the club only winning 3 of its first 10 matches. In May 2018, the new Canterbury board admitted that they would not be able to make any major signings until the end of the 2021 season due to the salary cap drama engulfing the club. The issue with the salary cap problems involved the previous administration and former coach Des Hasler who signed numerous players on back ended deals. In the wake of the scandal, the club was forced to offload players to free up room in the cap. This resulted in Moses Mbye departing for the Wests Tigers and star recruit Aaron Woods being sold to Cronulla after only signing with Canterbury months prior. On 16 June 2018, Canterbury suffered a humiliating 32–10 loss to the Gold Coast Titans at Belmore, in the press conference coach Dean Pay said &quot;Physically, we just weren&#x27;t good enough. The way they turned up, the way they trained during the week wasn&#x27;t good enough, I feel sorry for the fans&quot;.
On 20 July 2018, Canterbury played against arch rivals Parramatta in what the media had dubbed as the &quot;Spoon Bowl&quot; with both sides sitting at the bottom of the ladder. There were fears before the game that the match would attract the lowest NRL crowd in over 20 years. Parramatta went on to win the match 14–8.
After the defeat by Parramatta, Canterbury were facing the prospect of finishing with the wooden spoon for the first time since 2008 but over the coming four weeks the club managed to pull off upset wins against the Wests Tigers, the Brisbane Broncos and St. George to finish the season in 12th place. The lower grades of Canterbury performed better in 2018 with the club winning the NSW Cup, defeating Newtown 18–12 in the final and also winning the NRL State Championship defeating Redcliffe 42–18.

Canterbury started off the 2019 NRL season losing their two first games in convincing fashion against the Warriors and rivals Parramatta. Due to the bad start to the season, there were rumours that coach Dean Pay would be relieved of his duties but he was then granted a 12-month contract extension to remain as Canterbury coach until the end of 2020.

By the midway part of the 2019 season, Canterbury-Bankstown found themselves sitting last on the table and in real danger of finishing with the wooden spoon. However, for the third straight season, Canterbury achieved four upset victories in a row over Penrith, the Wests Tigers, South Sydney and Parramatta who were all competing for a place in the finals series and were higher on the table. Pay was credited with the late season revival as the side focused heavily on defence.

In the 2020 NRL season, Canterbury-Bankstown were defeated in both of their opening fixtures. The season was then temporarily postponed. Following the season resumption, they were defeated by Manly-Warringah at Central Coast Stadium. They then defeated the St George Illawarra Dragons 22–2 at Western Sydney Stadium. After round 9, they have not won a game. They were defeated in round 9 by the Brisbane Broncos at Lang Park 26–8. The speculation that then Head Coach Dean Pay would be sacked grew. By Tuesday 14 July 2020, Canterbury-Bankstown released a statement saying that Pay had resigned from his position. In this statement, the club announced that Pay&#x27;s assistant coach Steve Georgallis would take over the role. Following this, it was reported that Dean&#x27;s other assistant, Steve Antonelli, also resigned from his position. The clubs NSW Cup head coach Brad Henderson would fill in as Georgallis&#x27;s assistant coach.

On Wednesday 22 July 2020, the club announced that they had secured the services of former Manly Warringah Sea Eagles head coach and current (at 22 July 2020) Penrith Panthers assistant coach, Trent Barrett to coach the club from the start of season 2021 on a three-year deal.

Canterbury finished the 2020 NRL season in 15th place on the table after a horror year on and off the field. Canterbury finished on equal points with Brisbane but avoided the wooden spoon due to a slightly better for and against record.

Canterbury started the 2021 NRL season poorly losing their opening three matches including being kept scoreless in round 2 &amp; round 3 against Penrith and Brisbane respectively. This was the first time in the club&#x27;s history that this had occurred. In round 4 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were defeated 38-0 by South Sydney in the traditional Good Friday game. Canterbury became only the second team in the NRL era to lose three straight games without scoring a point after Cronulla who achieved this in the 2014 NRL season.

It was also the worst start to a season by any team since Glebe in the 1928 NSWRFL season who managed to only score 12 points in their first four matches. On 30 June 2021, Canterbury were fined $50,000 by the NRL after failing to communicate the increased COVID restrictions to players. The incident was in relation to five Canterbury players visiting Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs which was a COVID-19 hotspot.

In round 16 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury suffered their third heaviest defeat in club history losing 66–0 to Manly-Warringah at Western Sydney Stadium.

In round 22 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were handed their sixth wooden spoon after losing 24–10 against the Warriors. Canterbury needed to win the match and their remaining three fixtures to avoid finishing last.

Despite a number of off-season recruits, Canterbury started the 2022 NRL season poorly winning only two of their first ten matches. On 16 May 2022, Canterbury head coach Trent Barrett resigned from his position with the club sitting bottom of the table.
On 18 May 2022, Michael Potter was named as interim coach of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs after the resignation of Barrett. Under Potter, the club won five of their last 14 matches to avoid the wooden spoon by finishing 12th.

In round 18 of the 2023 NRL season, Canterbury suffered their equal third worst loss as a club when they were defeated 66-0 by Newcastle.
Canterbury would finish the 2023 NRL season in 15th place. The club also finished with the worst for and against out of all 17 teams with a -331 points differential.

In the 2024 NRL season, Canterbury qualified for the finals finishing 6th on the table. This was the first time in eight years that the club had managed to achieve this. However, they lost their elimination finals match 24-22 against Manly at Stadium Australia.

==Name and emblem==
The name and emblem of the club has changed several times over its history. At the club&#x27;s foundation in 1935, it was known only as &#x27;Canterbury-Bankstown&#x27;, without an animal mascot. The nicknames &#x27;Berries&#x27; and &#x27;C-Bs&#x27; (or, derisively, &#x27;Country Bumpkins&#x27;) were often used informally, &#x27;C-Bs&#x27; being used from the outset and &#x27;Berries&#x27; coming into use by the mid-1940s. The club had been referred to as the &#x27;Bulldogs&#x27; as early as 1977. In 1978, the Bulldog mascot and name was adopted, with the club becoming known as the &#x27;Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs&#x27;. This was the name used throughout the team&#x27;s 1980s glory era. In 1995 the club name was changed to &#x27;Sydney Bulldogs&#x27;, reflecting a similar change by Eastern Suburbs (to &#x27;Sydney City Roosters&#x27;). The name changed again in 1996, returning to &#x27;Canterbury Bulldogs&#x27; with &#x27;Bankstown&#x27; omitted, and yet again in 2000, to the geographically indistinct &#x27;Bulldogs&#x27;. Bob Hagan, the club boss at the time of the 2000 change, explained that the dropping of the name &#x27;Canterbury&#x27; was intended to broaden the appeal of the club outside of its traditional supporter base, so that the club could attract a geographically diverse following like Manchester United or the Chicago Bulls. Despite the name change, some supporters, as well as many television and radio commentators, continued to refer to the club as &#x27;Canterbury&#x27;. In the most recent change, board officials voted in late 2009 for the club to return to &#x27;Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs&#x27; from the 2010 season onwards.

The initial crest was a &#x27;C-B&#x27; in a shield. The adoption of the &#x27;Bulldogs&#x27; name and mascot took place in 1978. There have been three main versions of the mascot logo. The first, which featured a snarling bulldog inside a circle, was replaced in 1998 by a more &#x27;cartoonish&#x27; logo of a bulldog&#x27;s head. In 2009, the club announced that the logo would be changing again, and asked members to vote on which of two similar proposed logos would be used from 2010. The rationale for the logo change was to celebrate the club&#x27;s 75th anniversary in 2010 and to better reflect the club&#x27;s &quot;true essence and history&quot;. Two months later, the new design was unveiled, with the official change of logo taking place in November 2009. The current logo returns to the standing bulldog of the 1978–1997 logo, although it is no longer snarling. It also references elements of the club&#x27;s history by incorporating the &#x27;C-B&#x27; emblem, the club&#x27;s year of foundation (1935), and the blue and white &#x27;V&#x27; design which has featured on many of the club&#x27;s jerseys over the years. The change of name from &#x27;Bulldogs&#x27; to &#x27;Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs&#x27; took place after the new logo was unveiled.

==Colours==
The Bulldogs have played in predominantly blue and white strip since the club entered the league in 1935. The only exception to this was during the Second World War, when rationing meant they had to wear a maroon jersey with a blue &#x27;V&#x27;.

There have been four basic strip designs since the club&#x27;s inception in the top-flight league competition:
* The irregular (&quot;butcher stripes&quot;) stripes design – used from 1935 until 1962. This design had blue and white irregular stripes worn with black shorts. The irregular strip has been used recently in occasional &#x27;heritage&#x27; matches (e.g. Heritage round in 2008 vs St. George Illawarra)
* Maroon with Blue V - used from 1943 until 1945 during the war. Due to the war effort, dye was in limited supply. Teams were asked to avoid stripes to conserve dye. This jersey design has been seen as &#x27;unlucky&#x27; by fans.
* The &#x27;V Strip&#x27; – used between 1963 and 1969, and revived in 1973. White shirt with blue V, blue shorts. The current &quot;away&quot; strip has blue shorts, but features a blue shirt with white V.
* Blue &amp; White hoops - From 1970 to 1972, the club adopted a jersey featuring blue and white hoops. This reverted to the &#x27;V Strip&#x27; from 1973 onwards.

==Stadium==

In their inaugural season, very few home matches were allocated to the Canterbury-Bankstown club. However, when the opportunity arose the club took their matches to either Marrickville or Pratten Park. From the following season, the club began to base itself at Belmore Sports Ground. The club had a long-time affinity with the ground and stayed there continuously until 1994.

In 1995 when the Super League War began to come about, the club changed its playing name to the &quot;Sydney Bulldogs&quot; in an attempt to broaden its fan base and played matches at Parramatta Stadium where spectator facilities were of a higher class. This move paid off with the club going on to become premiers that season. However, the club reverted its name to Canterbury for the 1996 season and once again played matches out of Belmore Sports Ground; something that lasted up until the inaugural National Rugby League season of 1998.
Once the new Stadium Australia had been finished and opened in preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the club began to play matches there between 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, the club then began to play matches out of the new Sydney Showground at Homebush Bay, with bigger matches played out of Stadium Australia from 2003. When fans began to complain about the poor quality of the Showground venue as a rugby league ground, the club eventually decided to move all future home matches to the Stadium, where the club remains. 

The club&#x27;s training and administration offices remained at Belmore Sports Ground until the beginning of 2008, but were relocated to Sydney Olympic Park during the 2008 season. With the NSW Government committing to upgrading Belmore Sports Ground, the club administration and training has now been returned to the historical ground after a $9 million upgrade.

In 2015, the club played two home games at their traditional home ground Belmore Sports Ground as part of the club&#x27;s 80th-anniversary celebrations. They have continued to play some games at Belmore every year since 2015. From 2019, the club started to schedule only one home fixture at Belmore Sports Ground. No game was held at Belmore in the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 season postponement and season rescheduling.

==Supporters==

The Bulldogs Army is the core supporter group for the Bulldogs, with the section they sit within known as &#x27;The Kennel&#x27;. To be sitting in this section, supporters must become a member of the club itself and register any large flags and/or banners which are brought to the game. At all away games the Bulldogs Army locates themselves in the general admission section. The main aim of the Bulldogs Army is to show support and passion for Canterbury.

As the region&#x27;s traditional local representatives, the Bulldogs predominantly draw on a support base in and around the districts of Canterbury and Bankstown in south-western Sydney, although in recent years club administration and home matches have relocated to Sydney Olympic Park. The Bulldogs are the most supported NRL club in regional NSW—over 25% of Bulldog fans are located in regional NSW, over 25% are located outside of NSW and over 10% are located in Queensland. The club at one stage had one of the highest average attendances in the league: over the 2010 season, it was one of only two clubs to record an average home crowd of more than 20,000. At the end of the 2023 NRL season, the club recorded one of the lowest average home attendances in the league with 16,243.
At the end of the 2023 NRL season, the club recorded 22,000 memberships which ranked them higher than the majority of the nine Sydney clubs but significantly lower than South Sydney and Parramatta.

The multicultural demographics of the suburbs in the club&#x27;s support base, such as Lakemba, means the club has a large number of supporters from a range of non-Anglo ethnicities. In recent years the club has become particularly identified in the media with the Lebanese and the Greek community, particularly with the club&#x27;s former star goalkicker Hazem El Masri, who migrated from Lebanon as a young child. The Greek community has a huge history of Greeks playing for the club dating back to the 1970s with club legend Dr George Peponis, who migrated from Greece as a very young child who captained the Bulldogs and Australia. El Masri retired at the end of the 2009 season.

==Rivalries==

===Parramatta Eels===
The rivalry between the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Parramatta Eels is one of the fiercest in the NRL. The two clubs have been geographically close throughout their whole histories. In the 1980s, Canterbury and Parramatta both won four premierships each and met in two grand finals in 1984 and 1986.

In the 1990s, at the height of the super league war, Parramatta signed four of Canterbury&#x27;s star players Jarrod McCracken, Dean Pay, Jim Dymock and Jason Smith which helped Parramatta reach the finals for the first time in eleven years, in the 1998 preliminary final, Parramatta were winning against Canterbury 18–2 with less than ten minutes to play when Canterbury staged one of the biggest finals comebacks defeating Parramatta 32–20 in extra time.

In the 2007 NRL season, the club&#x27;s played each other in the elimination final at Telstra Stadium with Parramatta gaining revenge for the 1998 preliminary final as they defeated Canterbury 25–6.

In the 2009 NRL season, Parramatta defeated Canterbury in the preliminary final to cap off a remarkable run to the grand final. The crowd which attended the match was a non grand final record of 74,000 fans.

Speaking to the Herald Sun in 2007, former Canterbury-Bankstown player Craig Polla-Mounter described the rivalry between the two club&#x27;s saying &quot;I think the Parramatta and Canterbury fans can be the most unforgiving, especially when we play each other. I have no doubt it is the biggest rivalry in rugby league and part of the reason he didn&#x27;t play again&quot;. Polla-Mounter said this in reference to Parramatta player Paul Carige and his infamous performance in the 1998 preliminary final.

Speaking of the rivalry in 2015, former Canterbury player James Graham said &quot;As soon as I came to this club, I was told that they were the closest club to us and that there was no love lost between players and fans&quot;. Andrew Ryan who played for both clubs said &quot;Both clubs do speak about the rivalry, in the change room and leading into the clashes, they always want to get the wood on their rival, I went for Canterbury when I was a kid, but then got my first opportunity in first grade to play for Parramatta. They place a huge amount of emphasis on the game. I think I was one of the only players to go the other way, a lot of players who had played for the Bulldogs allayed first the Eels, not too many went the other way&quot;.

===Sydney Roosters===
The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a long-standing rivalry with fellow team the Sydney Roosters, Whilst both teams had crossed premiership paths in grand finals in four occasions. In 1938, Canterbury-Bankstown won their first premiership against the Eastern Suburbs as what they were known as back then winning 19–6 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Two years later in 1940, the sides met again with the Easts winning the 1940 NSWRFL Grand Final 24–14. In 1980, the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs broke a 38-year premiership drought defeating the Eastern Suburbs Roosters 18–4 at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

In 2002, the Sydney Roosters won the NRL premiership on the back of a 9-game winning streak. This was the same year the premiership favourite Canterbury were stripped of 37 points due to systematic breaches of the salary cap in 2001 and 2002, in 2003, the Roosters proved themselves worthy of defending premiers title when they defeated Canterbury in the preliminary final 28–18 in front of a sold out Sydney Football Stadium. In 2004, the Roosters defeated Canterbury 35–0 and fighting broke out in the stands during and after the game had been completed. While the Roosters finished the regular season with the minor premiership, Canterbury defeated them in the grand final 16–13 after trailing 13–6 at half time.

As of the 2024 NRL season, the last time the two clubs met in a finals game was the 2015 Elimination Final which the Roosters won 38–12 at the Sydney Football Stadium.

===St. George Illawarra Dragons===
The Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs have a fierce rivalry with their neighbour the St. George Illawarra Dragons. Canterbury-Bankstown were founded in 1935, fourteen years after St. George Dragons, St. George inflicted a premiership record 91–6 victory over Canterbury in 1935 but Canterbury enjoyed premiership success first in 1938 and St. George in 1942. In the 1942 NSWRFL season, the two clubs met in the Grand Final with Canterbury-Bankstown defeating St. George 11–9 in a low-scoring affair at the Sydney Cricket Ground. After that however, St. George recorded eleven straight premierships in the years following 1955–1966. It was also Canterbury who put an end to their Premiership run in 1967, when they beat them by a point in the preliminary final to face South Sydney in the grand final. Since then, both clubs inflicted Premiership defeats on the other, with the St. George Dragons defeating the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in their last grand final success in 1979, the Bulldogs returned the favour in 1985.

The two teams subsequently met in the 1993 preliminary final which St. George defeated Canterbury 27–12. They would meet again in the 1995 and 1998 finals series with Canterbury running out winners on both occasions. The elimination final in 1998 was also St. George&#x27;s last game as a stand-alone entity as the club elected to form a joint venture with Illawarra for the 1999 NRL season. Biggest loss 6–91 (85 pts) – 11 May 1935 – vs. St George.

===South Sydney Rabbitohs===

Souths and Canterbury-Bankstown have played each other every Good Friday since 2012. They met in the 1967 NSWRFL Grand Final with South Sydney winning 12–10. However, the competitive nature intensified when they met in the 2014 NRL Grand Final where Souths won 30–6 to claim their first premiership since 1971.

During their Good Friday clash in 2015, this game was labelled &quot;Bad Friday&quot; for its controversy, as South Sydney won 18–17 thanks to a late penalty goal. Canterbury fans were angry about the match officials decision and attacked the match officials when they walked off the field, throwing bottles at them, even causing one of them to slip over. Some fans were given lifetime bans for throwing bottles at the match officials.

In round 4 of the 2021 NRL season, Canterbury were defeated 38–0 by South Sydney in the traditional Good Friday game. Canterbury became only the second team in the NRL era to lose three straight games without scoring a point after Cronulla who achieved this in the 2014 NRL season. It was also the worst start to a season by any team since Glebe in the 1928 NSWRFL season who managed to only score 12 points in their first four matches. In round 6 of the 2023 NRL season, South Sydney recorded the most amount of points scored by a winning team in the Good Friday game as they defeated Canterbury 50–16.

==Canterbury League Club==
The Canterbury League Club is the licensed club of the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. Canterbury League Club first opened its doors for trade in September 1956 to service the needs of the football club and local community. The Salvation Army Hall became the first venue of the Canterbury League Club. Sixty people would fill the venue on a busy night.

In the first two years of trade the club was outgrowing itself and in 1960 the Club moved its premises to Bridge St which allowed the League Club to grow as well as cater for patron parking.

In 2000, the Board had approved major renovations. The renovations started in 2000 and in 2002 the Brasserie, Restaurant, new foyer, level 1 and health club were opened to the public.

The club also amalgamated with Lakemba Services Memorial Club (2008) &amp; Belfield RSL (2013).

Canterbury League Club has amenities including three restaurants, two coffee shops, multiple bars and entertainment lounges and a 24-hour health club.

==Statistics and records==
Hazem El Masri holds the NRL record for the most games played for the club, having made 317 appearances in total.

Hazem El Masri also holds records for the most points scored, the most tries scored and the most points scored for the Bulldogs. Since his debut in 1996, he has scored a total of 2,418 points—which was also a competition record for Rugby League in Australia until 2019. Former player Daryl Halligan, who retired with the club in 2000, had previously held the competition record for most points scored with 2,034, which included points scored whilst at his former club the North Sydney Bears.

The club&#x27;s largest win occurred in 1995 when they played as the &quot;Sydney Bulldogs.&quot; In a match against the newly formed North Queensland Cowboys, the Bulldogs won 66–4. In the club&#x27;s first season in 1935 they were subject to the two heaviest defeats in competition history two weeks in succession. Firstly, they lost to St. George 91–6 and the following week to Eastern Suburbs 87–7. However, despite these big losses, the club was able to secure their first premiership three years later in 1938 in the Grand Final against Eastern Suburbs; at the same time setting the record for becoming the quickest non-foundation club to win a title. This record was not broken until 1999.

In 2002, the club won 17 matches in a row after getting beaten by the New Zealand Warriors; falling just two short of the record set by the Eastern Suburbs team of 1975.

In round 7 of the 2014 season, after beating the South Sydney Rabbitohs 15–14, Canterbury became the first club to win three consecutive matches by one point. They went on to be runners up to South Sydney in the grand final.

Canterbury are the only team in NSWRL/NRL history to win a premiership and then finish with back to back wooden spoon&#x27;s. In 1942, Canterbury won their second premiership defeating St. George in the grand final but then finished last in 1943 and 1944. Canterbury also endured one of the longest premiership droughts in the competitions history with the club not winning a title between 1942 and 1980 which totalled 38 years.

In 1908 and 1909 the only districts with Junior Leagues were South Sydney and Balmain. The first clubs from the Canterbury district to participate in rugby league were Belmore in the NSWRL 2nd grade competition, and Campsie Triers in the Western Suburbs A Grade. When the St George JRL was established in 1911, Canterbury clubs were allocated to this competition. In 1922 the Canterbury JRL was established and Campsie Iona with 17 points edged out Wattle Hill 16 for the A Grade title, Lakemba won B Grade and Wattle Hill the C Grade. Campsie Iona repeated their A grade success in 1923, 1924 and 1925 before Belmore stopped their run in 1926.

<doc id="516745" wikidata="Q2567137" url="?curid=516745" title="Livia Soprano">
<text>Livia Soprano (née Pollio), portrayed by Nancy Marchand, is a fictional character on the HBO TV series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. She is the mother of Tony Soprano. A young Livia, played by Laila Robins and later by Laurie J. Williams, is sometimes seen in flashbacks. Series creator David Chase has stated that the main inspiration for the character was his own mother. Vera Farmiga portrays a young Livia Soprano in the 2021 prequel film, &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked her #3 of their &quot;40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time&quot;.

==Character biography==

Livia Pollio was born in Providence, Rhode Island to Teresa and Faustino &quot;Augie&quot; Pollio, Italian immigrants from Avellino. Livia&#x27;s childhood was poverty-stricken and miserable and her marriage to the tough and charismatic Johnny Soprano was Livia&#x27;s ticket out of her parents&#x27; house. Together they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. She also suffered a miscarriage years after her youngest child was born and almost died from heavy bleeding. Life as a housewife was unfulfilling for Livia and she felt overwhelmed by her three children and unappreciated by her unfaithful husband. Once, while driving home from the Copacabana her husband shot her through her beehive hairdo. She liked listening to Connie Francis and &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; when she was younger.

Cagey, manipulative, and self-absorbed, Livia Soprano seemingly derives little pleasure from life other than making the people around her miserable. On her son&#x27;s wedding day, she told her new daughter-in-law Carmela that marrying Tony was a mistake and eventually Tony would get bored with her. Her older daughter Janice moved to the West Coast when she was 18 and her younger daughter Barbara married into a successful family in New York. This left Tony with the sole responsibility of looking after Livia following Johnny&#x27;s death. As she gets older, her misery and mental state worsen. Dr. Melfi believes Livia has undiagnosed narcissistic or borderline personality disorder. 

Years later on season one of the show, Livia causes problems for Tony as revenge for putting her in a retirement home, Green Grove, and putting her house up for sale. This results in Tony almost being killed on two occasions. Tony narrowly avoids two hitmen after Junior Soprano finds out from Livia that Tony was subverting his power. Tony&#x27;s best friend Artie Bucco draws a rifle on Tony after Livia reveals that he burned down his restaurant. Tony is able to convince him otherwise and Artie smashes his gun in frustration.

It is later discovered that the FBI had bugged Livia&#x27;s retirement home, and the recordings of Livia conspiring with Junior are played for Tony. Tony&#x27;s plot for revenge is foiled when Livia suffers a stroke (said to be induced by repressed rage) and is taken into a hospital. Tony appears to be ready to smother her with a pillow, but she is rushed to the emergency room. He then publicly threatens to kill her, informing her that he had heard her conspiring with Junior from the FBI. However, Tony settles for cutting off all contact with her.

In season two, Livia&#x27;s daughter Janice returns to New Jersey. She takes up residence in Livia&#x27;s home and convinces Tony not to sell the house and instead let her take care of Livia. Livia is cautious of Janice&#x27;s sudden concern for her well-being and correctly guesses that Janice has ulterior motives. While Tony and Carmela avoid all contact with Livia, her grandchildren Meadow and A.J. still visit her, unaware of past events. Livia grows paranoid and more difficult when AJ inadvertently reveals to her that Janice and Tony were discussing possible &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; options for her. When Janice is forced to flee the state, Tony gives Livia a stolen plane ticket so she can stay with her sister. However, before she is set to leave, she is detained at the airport.

Tony hires a home assistant to look after Livia at the beginning of season three. Livia dies soon after from another stroke. After her death, Janice discovers that Livia kept many of Tony&#x27;s old childhood artifacts while only keeping some of Barbara&#x27;s and none of Janice&#x27;s. Livia appears as a younger woman in several flashbacks afterward, as well as being frequently referenced, with Tony still far from resolving his feelings towards her.

For season three, a storyline was planned where Livia would be called to testify against her son in court, giving evidence on stolen airline tickets she had received from him, but Marchand died on June 18, 2000, before it could be filmed. Existing footage and computer-generated imagery was used to create a final scene between Tony and Livia in the season three episode &quot;Proshai, Livushka&quot; before the character, too, died. The cost was approximately $250,000.

During the sixth-season episode &quot;Mayham&quot; when Tony is comatose from a gunshot wound, he has a vivid dream that ends with Tony being beckoned into a house by his dead cousin Tony Blundetto; a woman who looks similar to Livia can briefly be seen in the doorway of the house. Tony then hears a child&#x27;s voice calling &quot;Daddy, don&#x27;t go, come back.&quot; He then awakens to see his daughter Meadow and wife Carmela standing over him.

==Character origins==
David Chase based Livia on his own mother, Norma Chase. He described his mother as paranoid, abusive, sharp-tongued and dismissive of her son&#x27;s career achievements. Many of Livia&#x27;s memorable lines such as &quot;Poor you,&quot; &quot;Daughters are better at taking care of their mothers than sons,&quot; and &quot;Another toothpick&quot; are direct quotations of Norma Chase. Like Tony Soprano, David Chase spent years in psychotherapy addressing the consequences of her mothering.

Chase has also spoken highly of the 1934 novel &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, calling it one of his favorite works of fiction. While Chase has stopped short of drawing a direct connection, claiming he used the name of an aunt, many have compared the Machiavellian Livia Soprano to Claudius&#x27;s grandmother, Livia Drusilla. These suspicious tend to find confirmation in the maiden name Chase selected for Livia—Pollio, one shared by Gaius Asinius Pollio, who makes a decisive appearance in &quot;I, Claudius&quot;.

<text>The Allegheny Mountain Range ( ) — also spelled Alleghany or Allegany, less formally the Alleghenies — is part of the vast Appalachian Mountain Range of the Eastern United States and Canada. Historically it represented a significant barrier to westward land travel and development. The Alleghenies have a northeast–southwest orientation, running for about from north-central Pennsylvania southward, through western Maryland and eastern West Virginia.

The Alleghenies comprise the rugged western-central portion of the Appalachians. They rise to in northeastern West Virginia. In the east, they are dominated by a high, steep escarpment known as the Allegheny Front. In the west, they slope down into the closely associated Allegheny Plateau, which extends into Ohio and Kentucky. The principal settlements of the Alleghenies are Altoona, State College, and Johnstown, Pennsylvania; and Cumberland, Maryland.

Using the USGS classification of physical geography (physiography), the Allegheny Mountain range is part of the Appalachian Plateau province of the Appalachian Highlands physiographic division.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Allegheny River, which drains only a small portion of the Alleghenies in west-central Pennsylvania. The meaning of the word, which comes from the Lenape (Delaware) Native Americans, is not definitively known but is usually translated as &quot;fine river&quot;. The closest approximation which makes sense is some context from the Jesuit Relations showing that Alligeh was one of several accepted renderings of the name of the Erie people among the early 17th century missionaries among the Native peoples throughout the eastern Great Lakes region, along with Rique, Yenresh and Erichronon. The suffix -ni means &quot;of the,&quot; in Lenape, despite the irony that geh is also Iroquoian for &quot;of the.&quot; So, most likely, Alligehni, or Oligini, would probably be the Lenape name for the original homeland of the Erie people.

The word &quot;Allegheny&quot; was once commonly used to refer to the whole of what are now called the Appalachian Mountains. John Norton used it (spelled variously) around 1810 to refer to the mountains in Tennessee and Georgia. Around the same time, Washington Irving proposed renaming the United States either &quot;Appalachia&quot; or &quot;Alleghania&quot;. In 1861, Arnold Henry Guyot published the first systematic geologic study of the whole mountain range. His map labeled the range as the &quot;Alleghanies&quot;, but his book was titled &quot;On the Appalachian Mountain System&quot;. As late as 1867, John Muir—in his book &quot;A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf&quot;—used the word &quot;Alleghanies&quot; in referring to the &quot;southern&quot; Appalachians.

There was no general agreement about the &quot;Appalachians&quot; versus the &quot;Alleghanies&quot; until the late 19th century.

==Geography==
===Extent===
From northeast to southwest, the Allegheny Mountains run about . From west to east, at their widest, they are about . When combining the Allegheny Province with the Kanawa Province, they run .

The USGS physiographic classification of all land in the United States lists the Allegheny Mountains as a section within the larger Appalachian Plateau province. It may be generally defined to the south by the Allegheny Front, and to the east by the Susquehanna River valley. To the west, the Alleghenies grade down into the dissected Allegheny Plateau. The westernmost ridges are considered to be the Laurel Highlands and Chestnut Ridge in Pennsylvania, and Laurel Mountain and Rich Mountain in West Virginia.

Big Stone Ridge marks the southern extent of the Alleghenies and is an outlier of Flat Top Mountain, with the Tug Fork river running along its western flank. The land to the south and to the west of the Alleghenies is the Valley and Ridge physiographic province.

===Allegheny Front and Allegheny Highlands===
The eastern edge of the Alleghenies is marked by the Allegheny Front, which is also sometimes considered the eastern terminus of the Allegheny Plateau. This great escarpment roughly follows a portion of the Eastern Continental Divide in this area. A number of impressive gorges and valleys drain the Alleghenies: to the east, Smoke Hole Canyon (South Branch Potomac River), and to the west the New River Gorge and the Blackwater and Cheat Canyons. Thus, about half the precipitation falling on the Alleghenies makes its way west to the Mississippi and half goes east to Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic seaboard.

The highest ridges of the Alleghenies are just west of the Front, which has an east/west elevational change of up to . Absolute elevations of the Allegheny Highlands reach nearly , with the highest elevations in the southern part of the range. The highest point in the Allegheny Mountains is Spruce Knob (), on Spruce Mountain in West Virginia. Other notable Allegheny highpoints include Thorny Flat on Cheat Mountain (), Bald Knob on Back Allegheny Mountain (), and Mount Porte Crayon (), all in West Virginia; Dans Mountain () in Maryland, Backbone Mountain (), the highest point in Maryland; Mount Davis (), the highest point in Pennsylvania, and the second highest, Blue Knob ().

===Development===
There are very few sizable cities in the Alleghenies. The four largest are (in descending order of population): Altoona, State College, Johnstown (all in Pennsylvania) and Cumberland (in Maryland). In the 1970s and &#x27;80s, the Interstate Highway System was extended into the northern portion of the Alleghenies, and the region is now served by a network of federal expressways—Interstates 80, 70/76 and 68. Interstate 64 traverses the southern extremity of the range, but the Central Alleghenies (the &quot;High Alleghenies&quot; of eastern West Virginia) have posed special problems for highway planners owing to the region&#x27;s very rugged terrain and environmental sensitivities (see Corridor H). This region is still served by a rather sparse secondary highway system and remains considerably lower in population density than surrounding regions.

In the telecommunications field, a unique impediment to development in the central Allegheny region is the United States National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), a large rectangle of land—about —that straddles the border area of Virginia and West Virginia. Created in 1958 by the Federal Communications Commission, the NRQZ severely restricts all omnidirectional and high-power radio transmissions, although cell phone service is allowed throughout much of the area.

===Protected areas===
Much of the Monongahela (West Virginia), George Washington (West Virginia, Virginia) and Jefferson (Virginia) National Forests lie within the Allegheny Mountains. (No part of the wooded Alleghenies in Maryland or Pennsylvania, however, is managed by the U.S. Forest Service.) The Alleghenies also include a number of federally designated wilderness areas, such as the Dolly Sods Wilderness, Laurel Fork Wilderness, and Cranberry Wilderness in West Virginia.

The mostly completed Allegheny Trail, a project of the West Virginia Scenic Trails Association since 1975, runs the length of the range within West Virginia. The northern terminus is at the Mason–Dixon line and the southern is at the West Virginia-Virginia border on Peters Mountain.

==Geology==

The bedrock of the Alleghenies is mostly sandstone and metamorphosed sandstone, quartzite, which is extremely resistant to weathering. Prominent beds of resistant conglomerate can be found in some areas, such as the Dolly Sods. When it weathers, it leaves behind a pure white quartzite gravel. The rock layers of the Alleghenies were formed during the Appalachian orogeny.

Because of intense freeze-thaw cycles in the higher Alleghenies, there is little native bedrock exposed in most areas. The ground surface usually rests on a massive jumble of sandstone rocks, with air space between them, that are gradually moving down-slope. The crest of the Allegheny Front is an exception, where high bluffs are often exposed.

Mineral springs in the High Alleghenies attracted Native Americans and 18th century white settlers and provided a modest incentive to the local economy. The spas developing around these geological features include celebrated resorts that continue to cater to an exclusive clientele, such as The Greenbrier (White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia; hotel built 1858) and The Homestead (Hot Springs, Virginia; original lodge built 1766).

==Ecology==

===Flora===
The High Alleghenies are noted for their forests of red spruce, balsam fir, and mountain ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory can also be found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The wild onion known as the ramp (&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot;) is also present in the deeper forests.

Certain isolated areas in the High Alleghenies are well known for their open expanses of sphagnum bogs and heath shrubs (e.g., Dolly Sods, Cranberry Glades). Many plant communities are indeed similar to those of sea-level eastern Canada. But the ecosystems within the Alleghenies are remarkably varied. In recent decades, the many stages of ecologic succession throughout the area have made the region one of enduring interest to botanists.

===Fauna===
The larger megafauna which once inhabited the High Alleghenies—elk, bison, mountain lion—were all exterminated during the 19th century. They survived longer in this area, however, than in other parts of the eastern United States. Naturalist John James Audubon reported that by 1851 a few eastern elk (&quot;Cervus canadensis canadiensis&quot;) could still be found in the Alleghany Mountains but that by then they were virtually gone from the remainder of their range. Mammals in the Allegheny region today include whitetail deer, chipmunk, raccoon, skunk, groundhog, opossum, weasel, field mouse, flying squirrel, cottontail rabbit, gray foxes, red foxes, gray squirrels, red squirrels and a cave bat. Bobcat, snowshoe hare, wild boar and black bear and coyote are also found in the forests and parks of the Alleghenies. Mink and beaver are much less often seen.

These mountains and plateau have over 20 species of reptiles represented as lizard, skink, turtle and snake. Some of the icterid birds visit the mountains as well as the hermit thrush and wood thrush. North American migrant birds live throughout the mountains during the warmer seasons. Occasionally, osprey and eagles can be found nesting along the streams. The hawks and owls are the most common birds of prey.

The water habitats of the Alleghenies hold 24 families of fish. Amphibian species number about 21, among them hellbenders, lungless salamanders, and various toads and frogs. The Alleghenies provide habitat for about 54 species of common invertebrate. These include Gastropoda, slugs, leech, earthworms and grub worm. Cave crayfish (&quot;Cambarus nerterius&quot;) live alongside a little over seven dozen cave invertebrates.

==History==

===Pre-contact Native Americans===
The indigenous people inhabiting the Allegheny Mountains emerged from the greater region&#x27;s archaic and mound building cultures, particularly the Adena and Eastern Woodland peoples with a later Hopewellian influence. These Late Middle Woodland culture people have been called the Montaine (c. A.D. 500 to 1000) culture. Their neighbors, the woodland Buck Garden culture, lived in the western valleys of the central Allegheny range. The Montaine sites extend from the tributaries of the upper Potomac River region south to the New River tributaries. These also were influenced by the earlier Armstrong culture of the more southwestern portions northern sub-range of the Ouasioto (Cumberland) Mountains and by the more easterly Virginia Woodland people. The Late Woodland Montaine were less influenced by Hopewellian trade from Ohio, although similarly polished stone tools have been found among the Montaine sites in the Tygart Valley. Small groups of Montaine people appear to have lingered much beyond their classically defined period in parts of the most mountainous valleys.

The watershed of the Monongahela River is within the northwestern Alleghenies, and it is from it that the Monongahela culture takes its name. The Godwin-Portman site (36AL39) located in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, had a possible Fort Ancient (c. AD 850 to 1680) presence during the 15th century. Washington Boro ceramics have been found on the Barton (18AG3) and Llewellyn (18AG26) sites in Maryland on the northeastern slopes of the late Susquehannock sequence. The early Monongahela (c. AD 900 to 1630) are called the Drew Tradition in Pennsylvania. According to archeologist Richard L. George: &quot;I believe that some of the Monongahela were of Algonquin origin... Other scholars have suggested that Iroquoian speakers were interacting with Late Monongahela people, and additional evidence is presented to confirm this. I conclude that the archaeologically conceived term, Monongahela, likely encompasses speakers of several languages, including Siouan.&quot; According to Dr Maslowski of West Virginia in 2009: &quot;The New River Drainage and upper Potomac represents the range of the Huffman Phase (Page) hunting and gathering area or when it is found in small amounts on village sites, trade ware or Page women being assimilated into another village (tribe).&quot; Finally, according to Prof Potter of Virginia, they [the people represented by the Huffman Phase of Page pottery] had occupied the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies on the upper Potomac to the northern, lower Shenandoah Valley region before the A.D. 1300 Luray phase (Algonquian) peoples&#x27; &quot;invasion&quot;. It is thought that these ancient Alleghenians were pushed from the classic Huffman Phase of the eastern slopes of the Alleghenies to the Blue Ridge Mountains in western Virginia, which was eastern Siouan territory.

In 1669, John Lederer and members of his party became the first Europeans to crest the Blue Ridge Mountains and the first to see the Shenandoah Valley and the Allegheny Mountains beyond.

===Native Americans in the 17th century===
The proto-historic Alleghenies can be exampled by the earliest journals of the colonists. According to Batts and Fallows&#x27; September, 1671 Expedition, they found Mehetan Indians of Mountain &quot;Cherokee-Iroquois&quot; mix on the New River tributaries. This journal does not identify the &quot;Salt Village&quot;, but, that the &quot;Mehetan&quot; were associated with these and today thought to be &quot;Monetons&quot;, Siouans. However, this journal does not identify the &quot;Salt Village&quot; below the Kanawha Falls, but, that simply the &quot;Mehetan&quot; were associated with these. He explained, below the &quot;Salt Villages&quot;, a mass of hostile Indians had, implied, arrived and some believe these to be &quot;Shanwans&quot; of Vielles Expedition of 1692~94, ancient Shawnee. In 1669, John Lederer of Maryland for the Virginia Colony and the Tennessee Cherokee had visited the mouth of the Kanawha and reported no hostilities on the lower streams of the Alleghenies. The Mohetan representative through a Siouan translator explained to Mr Batts and Mr Fallon, Colonel Abraham Woods explorers 1671–2, that he (Moheton Native American) could not say much about the people below the &quot;Salt Village&quot; because they (Mountain Cherokee) were not associated with them. The Mohetan was armed by this time of 1671 for the Mohetan Representative was given several pouches of ammunition for his and the other&#x27;s weapons as a token of friendship. Somebody had already been trading within the central Alleghenies before the Virginians historical record begins in the Allegheny Mountains. Some earlier scholars found evidence these Proto-historics were either Cistercians of Spanish Ajacan Occuquan outpost on the Potomac River or Jesuits and their Kahnawake Praying Indians (Mohawk) on the Riviere de la Ronceverte. The &quot;Kanawha Madonna&quot; may date from this period or earlier. Where the New River breaks through Peters&#x27; Mountain, near Pearisburg Virginia the 1671 journal mentions the &quot;Moketans had formerly lived&quot;.

According to a number of early 17th century maps, the Messawomeake or &quot;Mincquas&quot; (Dutch) occupied the northern Allegheny Mountains. The &quot;Shatteras&quot; (an ancient Tutelo) occupied the Ouasioto Mountains and the earliest term Canaraguy (Kanawhans otherwise Canawest) on the 1671 French map occupied the southerly Alleghenies. They were associated with the Allegheny &quot;Cherokee&quot; and Eastern Siouan as trade-movers and canoe transporters. The Calicuas, an ancient most northern Cherokee, migrated or was pushed from the Central Ohio Valley onto the north eastern slopes of the Alleghenies of the ancient Messawomeake, Iroquois tradesmen to 1630s Kent Island, by 1710 maps. Sometime before 1712, the Canawest (&quot;Kanawhans&quot;-&quot;Canallaway&quot;-&quot;Canaragay&quot;) had moved to the upper Potomac and made a Treaty with the newly established trading post of Fort Conolloway which would become a part of western Maryland during the 1740s.

===Trading posts and other settlements===
Prior to European exploration and settlement, trails through the Alleghenies had been transited for many generations by American Indian tribes such as the Iroquois, Shawnee, Delaware, Catawba and others, for purposes of trade, hunting and, especially, warfare. Western Virginia &quot;Cherokee&quot; were reported at Cherokee Falls, today&#x27;s Valley Falls of the Tygart Valley. Indian trader Charles Poke&#x27;s trading post dates from 1731 with the Calicuas of Cherokee Falls still in the region from the previous century.

The &quot;London Scribes&quot; (The Crown&#x27;s taxation records) vaguely mentions the colonial Alleghenian location of only a few other early colonial trading locations. A general knowledge of these few outposts are more of traditional telling of some local people. However, an example is the &quot;Van Metre&quot; trading house mentioned in an earlier edition of the &quot;Wonderful West Virginia Magazine&quot; being on the South Branches of the upper reaches of the Potomac. Another very early trading house appears on a lower Greenbrier Valley map during the earlier decades of the 18th century.

As early as 1719, new arrivals from Europe began to cross the lower Susquehanna River and settle illegally in defiance of the Board of Property in Pennsylvania, on un-warranted land of the northeastern drainage rivers of the Allegheny Mountains. Several Indian Nations requested the removal of &quot;Maryland Intruders&quot;. Some of these moved onward as territory opened up beyond the Alleghenies.

The first permanent European settlers &quot;west&quot; of the Alleghenies have traditionally been considered to have been two New Englanders: Jacob Marlin and Stephen Sewell, who arrived in the Greenbrier Valley in 1749. They built a cabin together at what would become Marlinton, West Virginia, but after disputing over religion, Sewell moved into a nearby hollowed-out sycamore tree. In 1751, surveyor John Lewis (father of Andrew Lewis) discovered the pair. Sewell eventually settled on the eastern side of Sewell Mountain, near present-day Rainelle, West Virginia. They may well have been the first to settle what was then called the &quot;western waters&quot;—&quot;i.e.&quot;, in the regions where streams flowed westward to the Gulf of Mexico rather than eastward to the Atlantic.

===First surveys===

Among the first whites to penetrate into the Allegheny Mountains were surveyors attempting to settle a dispute over the extent of lands belonging to either Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron or to the English Privy Council. An expedition of 1736 by John Savage established the location of the source of the North Branch Potomac River. In March 1742, a frontiersman named John Howard—along with his son and others—had been commissioned by Governor Gooch to explore the southwest of Virginia as far as the Mississippi River. Following Cedar Creek through the Natural Bridge, they floated in buffalo-skin boats down the New, Coal, Kanawha, and Ohio Rivers to the Mississippi. Although captured by the French before he reached Natchez, Howard was eventually released and (in 1745) was interviewed by Fairfax. Howard&#x27;s description of the South Branch Potomac River resulted in the definite decision by Fairfax to secure his lands in the region. An expedition under Peter Jefferson and Thomas Lewis in the following year emplaced the &quot;Fairfax Stone&quot; at the source of the North Branch and established a line of demarcation (the &quot;Fairfax Line&quot;) extending from the stone south-east to the headwaters of the Rappahannock River. Lewis&#x27; journal of that expedition provides a valuable view of the Allegheny country before its settlement. Jefferson and Joshua Fry&#x27;s &quot;Fry-Jefferson Map&quot; of 1751 accurately depicted the Alleghenies for the first time. In the following decades, pioneer settlers arrived in the Alleghenies, especially during Colonial Virginia&#x27;s Robert Dinwiddie era (1751–58). These included squatters by the Quit-rent Law. Some had preceded the official surveyors using a &quot;hack on the tree and field of corn&quot; marking land ownership approved by the Virginia Colonial Governor who had to be replaced with Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore.

===First roads===
Trans-Allegheny travel had been facilitated when a military trail—Braddock Road—was blazed and opened by the Ohio Company in 1751. (It followed an earlier Indian and pioneer trail known as Nemacolin&#x27;s Path.) Braddock Road connected Cumberland, Maryland (the upper limit of navigation on the Potomac River) and the forks of the Ohio River (the future Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). It received its name from the British leader of the French and Indian War (1754–63), General Edward Braddock, who led the ill-fated Braddock expedition four years later.

In addition to the war, hunting and trading with Indians were primary motivations for white movement across the mountains. Permanent white settlement of the northern Alleghenies was facilitated by the explorations and stories of such noted Marylanders as the Indian fighter and trader Thomas Cresap (1702–90) and the backwoodsman and hunter Meshach Browning (1781–1859). In the late 18th century, a massive migration to the Monongahela River basin took place over three main routes: along the old Braddock Road via Winchester, Virginia; through the Shenandoah Valley to the head of the Cheat River and from there to the Monongahela; and along the Lincoln Highway to Ligonier, Pennsylvania, and thence along Jacob&#x27;s Creek to the Monongahela. These immigrants were predominantly Scotch-Irish, German, and, to a lesser extent, British stock.

The Braddock Road was superseded by the Cumberland Road—also called the National Road—one of the first major improved highways in the United States to be built by the federal government. Construction began in 1811 at Cumberland and the road reached Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia) on the Ohio River in 1818. Just to the south, the state-funded Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike was constructed to provide a direct route for the settlements of the Shenandoah Valley to the Ohio River by way of the Tygart Valley and Little Kanawha Rivers. Planned and approved in 1826 and completed in 1848, the Staunton and Parkersburg was maintained by fees (tolls) collected at toll houses placed at regular intervals.

===First railroads and canals===
Construction on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began at Baltimore in 1828; the B&amp;O traversed the Alleghenies, changing the economy and society of the Mountains forever. The B&amp;O had reached Martinsburg, (West) Virginia by May 1842, Hancock, (West) Virginia, by June, Cumberland, Maryland, on November 5, 1842, Piedmont, (West) Virginia on July 21, 1851, and Fairmont, (West) Virginia on June 22, 1852. (It finally reached its Ohio River terminus at Wheeling, (West) Virginia on January 1, 1853.)

The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal — also begun in 1828, but at Georgetown — was also a public work of enormous economic and social significance for the Alleghenies. It approached Hancock, Maryland, by 1839. From the beginning, the B&amp;O Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal operated in bitter legal and commercial competition with one another as they vied for rights to the narrow strips of land along the Potomac. When the Canal finally reached Cumberland in 1850, the Railroad had already arrived eight years before. Debt-ridden, the Canal company dropped its plan to continue construction of the next of the Canal into the Ohio Valley. The company had long realized—especially with the difficult experience of digging the Paw Paw Tunnel—that the original plan of construction over the mountains and all the way down the Youghiogheny River to Pittsburgh was &quot;wildly unrealistic&quot;.

Public works financed at the state level were not lacking during this period. The Main Line of Public Works was a transportation network project built between 1826 and 1834 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It created a railroad and canal system across southern Pennsylvania between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, intended to transport freight (notably including anthracite coal) and people with greater reliability, speed and capacity. The Main Line of Public Works included the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, the Allegheny Portage Railroad and the Pennsylvania Canal system.
===Civil War===
Lying astride the border separating the Union and Confederacy, the Alleghenies were among the areas most directly affected by the American Civil War (1861–1865). One of the earliest campaigns of the War was fought for control of the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike and for the access it provided to the B&amp;O Railroad. The Battle of Rich Mountain (July 11, 1861) gave the Federals control of the turnpike, of Tygart&#x27;s Valley, and of all of the territory of western Virginia to the north and west, including the railroad. (Union General George McClellan&#x27;s victory in this theater would ultimately bring him promotion to commander the Army of the Potomac.) The Federals fortified at Cheat Summit, and the Confederates established strongholds at Camp Bartow and Camp Allegheny. Here they faced each other warily through the fall of 1861 and the following winter. General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s attempt to attack Cheat Summit Fort (September 12–15, 1861) and Federal attempts to attack Bartow and Allegheny, all failed to change the strategic stalemate. Finally, the harsh, high elevation winter achieved what the troops had failed to accomplish, and in the spring of 1862 both armies moved on down the pike to the Battle of McDowell (May 8, 1862), and then on to fight what became General Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Shenandoah Valley Campaign (spring 1862). Two years later, much of this contested area (along with much else) became part of the new state of West Virginia. The very rugged terrain of the Alleghenies was not at all amenable to a large-scale maneuver war and so the actions that the area witnessed for the remainder of the conflict were generally guerrilla in nature.

===Coal and timber industries===
With the further spread of the railroad networks in the 1890s and early 1900s, many new towns developed and thrived in the Alleghenies. The lumbering and coal industries that boomed in the wake of the railroads brought a measure of prosperity to the region, but most of the revenues flowed out of the mountains to the cities of the eastern seaboard where the captains of industry were headquartered. This inequity created a bitter legacy that would last for generations and form the foundation of the mountaineers&#x27; poverty and the area&#x27;s immense environmental degradation.

The most momentous disaster to afflict the people of the Alleghenies was the Johnstown Flood—locally known as the &quot;Great Flood of 1889&quot;—which occurred on May 31 of that year after the catastrophic failure of the South Fork Dam on the Little Conemaugh River upstream of the town of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The dam broke after several days of extremely heavy rainfall, unleashing 20 million tons of water (18 million cubic meters) from the reservoir known as Lake Conemaugh. (This body of water had been built as part of the Main Line of Public Works, then abandoned.) With a flow rate that temporarily equalled that of the Mississippi River, the flood killed 2,209 people and caused US$17 million of damage (about $425 million in 2012 dollars). The American Red Cross, led by Clara Barton and with 50 volunteers, undertook a major disaster relief effort. Support for victims came from all over the United States and 18 foreign countries. After the flood, survivors suffered a series of legal defeats in their attempts to recover damages from the dam&#x27;s owners. Public indignation at that failure prompted the development in American law changing a fault-based regime to strict liability.

===20th century===
In the 1920s and &#x27;30s, Allegheny highways were extensively paved to provide access for automobiles.

From the 1950s to 1992, the United States government maintained a top secret continuity program known as Project Greek Island at The Greenbrier hotel in the Alleghenies of southern West Virginia.

In August 1963, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. referenced the Alleghenies—among several in an evocative list of mountains—in his famous &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, when he said &quot;Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!&quot;

===21st century===
The Flight 93 National Memorial is located at the site of the crash of United Airlines Flight 93—which was hijacked in the September 11 attacks—in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, about north of Shanksville. The memorial honors the passengers and crew of Flight 93, who stopped Al-Qaeda terrorists from reaching their intended target.

<text>Trinity University is a private liberal arts college in San Antonio, Texas. Founded in 1869, its student body consists of about 2,600 undergraduate and 200 graduate students. Trinity offers 49 majors and 61 minors among six degree programs, and has an endowment of $1.856 billion.

== History ==
Cumberland Presbyterians founded Trinity in 1869 in Tehuacana, Texas, from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the Civil War: Chapel Hill College (founded 1849), Ewing College (founded 1848), and Larissa College (founded 1855). John Boyd, who had served in the Congress of the Republic of Texas from 1836 to 1845 and in the Texas Senate from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.

Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to Waxahachie, Texas. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the United Presbyterian Church. The Stock Market Crash of 1929, however, severely hindered the university&#x27;s growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools placed Trinity&#x27;s accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university&#x27;s viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the Methodist-affiliated University of San Antonio was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a Protestant-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to Southwestern Assemblies of God University). For the next decade, the Woodlawn campus, on the city&#x27;s near-west side, was Trinity&#x27;s home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military barracks and quonset huts to house students and to provide library and classroom space.

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former limestone quarry for a new campus and hired Texas architect O&#x27;Neil Ford to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings). Yet, under the leadership of James W. Laurie, the university&#x27;s 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity&#x27;s endowment, largely funded by the James A. and Leta M. Chapman Charitable Trust of Tulsa, Oklahoma. The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its &quot;University on the Hill&quot; location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969, Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the Presbyterian Church (USA) that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a &quot;historically connected&quot; member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.

Trinity&#x27;s growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie&#x27;s successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master&#x27;s programs offered from more than 20 to four. Also, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.

Calgaard&#x27;s successor, John R. Brazil, focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school&#x27;s financial resources. The &quot;Campaign for Trinity University&quot;, which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US$200 million for a variety of purposes. At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal. Brazil served as Trinity&#x27;s president through January 2010. Upon announcement of his retirement, the board of trustees awarded him its Distinguished Service Award, Trinity&#x27;s most prestigious honor.

Dennis A. Ahlburg served as president from January 2010 to January 2015. During Ahlburg&#x27;s presidency, Trinity developed and executed a strategic plan to shape the future of the university. Academically, Trinity refined its curriculum to further define a liberal arts education, developed an entrepreneurship program, and realigned the business program. Trinity also refocused its marketing to raise the university&#x27;s national profile. Finally, under Ahlburg, Trinity built the Center for Sciences and Innovation, which modernized and combined science facilities to ease collaboration across disciplines.

Danny J. Anderson, a Latin American literature scholar and dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Kansas, succeeded Ahlburg as president in May 2015, serving until May 31, 2022. During his tenure, improvements included the construction of Dicke Hall, home for Humanities studies; transformation of the Halsell Center into a modern learning environment, and creation of the Michael Neidorff School of Business, an AACSB-accredited undergraduate business school. The school was named a National Historic District during Anderson&#x27;s tenure. Anderson also implemented several initiatives aimed at increasing the school&#x27;s inclusivity, and by the end of his term 40% of Trinity&#x27;s student body came from underrepresented backgrounds.

Vanessa Beasley, former vice provost for academic affairs, dean of residential faculty, and associate professor of communication studies at Vanderbilt University was named Anderson&#x27;s successor on May 31, 2022. She will be the first woman to lead Trinity and began her term at the beginning of the 2022–23 school year. Megan Mustain, provost and vice president for academic affairs, was interim president until then.

== Campus ==

Trinity overlooks downtown San Antonio and is adjacent to the Monte Vista Historic District and just south of the cities of Olmos Park and Alamo Heights. The Skyline Campus, the university&#x27;s fourth location, is noted for its distinctive red-brick architecture and well-maintained grounds, modeled after an Italian village, by late architect O&#x27;Neil Ford.

=== Sustainability ===
Trinity is a member of the Presidents&#x27; Climate Commitment and is actively working toward carbon neutrality.

Miller Residence Hall, home to first-year students at Trinity University, was renovated and updated in 2010, earning gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification by the U.S. Green Building Council in the process. In addition, Calvert Hall, the Thomas-Lightner complex, and The Center for the Sciences and Innovation have been registered with the Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED program and are awaiting certification.

=== Notable buildings and structures ===
The tall Murchison Tower is the most dominant landmark on the campus, designed, as many other buildings on campus, by O&#x27;Neil Ford, who also designed San Antonio landmark the Tower of the Americas a few years later based on this design. It was previously the highest point in San Antonio. The tower is now lit at night (excepting evenings when the lighting interferes with on-campus astronomical observances), a tradition begun on September 22, 2002, to commemorate Trinity&#x27;s 60th anniversary in San Antonio.Laurie Auditorium seats 2,865 and hosts both campus and community events. The university has many lecture series, such as the high-profile Trinity Distinguished Lecture Series, Stieren Arts Enrichment Series, Nobel Economists Lecture Series, and Flora Cameron Lecture on Politics and Public Affairs.The Elizabeth Huth Coates Library houses more than 1 million books and bound periodical volumes. The library, an advanced facility for a school of Trinity&#x27;s size, also houses over 200,000 volumes of government documents, over 1.3 million microforms, over 65,000 media items, and maintains 2,400 periodical subscriptions and access to over 20,000 electronic periodicals. The library&#x27;s annual acquisition budget is over US$1.8 million.

In 2006, the Ruth Taylor Fine Arts Center, consisting of the Jim and Janet Dicke Art Building, the Campbell and Eloise Smith Music Building, and the Ruth Taylor Recital Hall was substantially renovated under the guidance of Kell Muñoz Architects, providing 20,000 additional square feet of space. The building subsequently won a merit award for design from the City of San Antonio in 2008.The Center for Sciences and Innovation (CSI), completed in 2014, modernized the university&#x27;s science, engineering, and laboratory facilities and helped ease collaboration across disciplines. Renovations to connect existing buildings allow for a 300,000 square-foot science facility. The complex, certified LEED Gold, features a rooftop observatory, a living &quot;green&quot; roof and rooftop greenhouse, and an open-air innovation and design studio. The new building helped Trinity earn a top-five ranking in the Princeton Review for best science lab facilities.

The Margarite B. Parker Chapel seats six hundred and is known for its large Hofmann-Ballard pipe organ, the largest pipe organ in South Texas, comprising 5 divisions, 102 stops, 112 ranks, and over 6,000 pipes. A state-of-the-art four-manual console was installed in summer 2007, with the aid of the university&#x27;s Calvert Trust Fund. Non-denominational services are led by the campus chaplain Sunday evenings.

In the Fall 2022, Trinity opened its latest building, Dicke Hall, which houses the Humanities Collective, the English Department, and the Religion Department. The building is 3 stories with 40,000 square feet, 6 classrooms, and 1 lecture hall. It was designed by the San Antonio architectural firm Lake Flato Architects using a mass-timber structural system also known as Engineered wood.

== Academics and rankings ==

== Student life ==

=== Greek life ===

Trinity hosts fourteen Greek organizations, seven fraternities and seven sororities. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; estimates that 14% of men and 19% of women were members, or about 17% of total undergraduate enrollment. The current fraternities and sororities are as follows:

Fraternities:
* Bengal Lancers
* Chi Delta Tau
* Iota Chi Rho
* Kappa Kappa Delta
* Omega Phi
* Phi Sigma Chi
* Triniteers

Sororities:
* Alpha Chi Lambda
* Chi Beta Epsilon
* Delta Theta Nu
* Gamma Chi Delta
* Phi Delta Kappa
* Sigma Theta Tau
* Spurs
* Zeta Chi

On occasion, fraternities and sororities have been mired in conflict at Trinity. In 1991, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Trinity had discontinued campus Greek organizations right to pledge new members as a result of being in violation of the university&#x27;s alcohol use policy. In 2012, two fraternities and two sororities had their charters temporarily revoked for hazing violations. These violations were said to have taken place over many years.

=== Activities ===

==== Student media ====

Trinity&#x27;s radio station, KRTU-FM, broadcasts jazz during the day, and indie rock overnight. TigerTV serves as the campus TV station. In addition to movies, the channel broadcasts three main shows: Newswave, Studio 21, and the Not So Late Show. &quot;The Trinitonian&quot; has been the weekly campus newspaper for 103 years, and has a print circulation of 2,500.

== Athletics ==

The Trinity Tigers is the nickname for the sports teams of Trinity University. They participate in the NCAA&#x27;s Division III and the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC). The school mascot is LeeRoy, a Bengal tiger. In the 1950s, LeeRoy was an actual tiger who was brought to sporting events, but today LeeRoy is portrayed by a student wearing a tiger suit.

Trinity fields strong teams, evidenced by its finishes in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Learfield Directors&#x27; Cup, which recognizes the strength of athletic programs by division. Since the Directors&#x27; Cup inception in 1995, Trinity has finished in the top 10 on five occasions out of over 400 Division Ill programs; it finished 31st in 2017–18.

Trinity has historically had a strong tennis program. In 1963, Al G. Hill Jr, grandson of oilman H L Hunt, entered as a Freshman Tennis Player. When he graduated in 1967 as Tiger Captain, the College Tennis Courts were named after him. Under the tutelage of Coach Clarence Mabry, Trinity Player Chuck McKinley won the Wimbledon Singles Championship in 1963 and was rated the #1 men&#x27;s Singles Player in the World. With partner Dennis Ralston, McKinley won the US Men&#x27;s Doubles Championship in 1961, 1963, and 1964. McKinley and Ralston also played all of the matches while winning the Davis Cup for the US in 1963. All of these accomplishments occurred while McKinley was a Trinity undergraduate.

In 1970, as a freshman at Trinity, Brian Gottfried won the USTA boys 18s Singles Championship, as well as the Doubles Championship with Alexander Mayer. In 1972 Trinity won the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Tennis Championship. The Tiger Captain that year, Dick Stockton, won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Singles Championship. The Women&#x27;s Team won the NCAA Collegiate National championship in 1968, 1969, 1973, 1975, and 1976. As recently as 2000, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs each won NCAA Division III National Championships.

In the 2007 Trinity v. Millsaps football game on October 27, 2007, trailing by two points with two seconds left, the Tigers used 15 laterals covering 60 yards for a touchdown to give Trinity the win as time expired. The unlikely play was named the top sports moment of the year by Time Magazine as well as the &quot;Game Changing Performance of the Year&quot; by Pontiac.

In November 2015, Trinity and Austin College announced they would affiliate with the Southern Athletic Association for football in 2017. This alliance renews a relationship that ended when the SAA schools split from the SCAC. As a result, the SCAC will no longer offer football as a sport.

In May 2016, the Trinity Baseball Team won the Division III College World Series in a best-of-three format, beating Keystone College 14–6 in game 1 and 10–7 in game 2. Trinity defeated the 2015 champion, SUNY Cortland twice in the bracket rounds of the tournament en route to the championship.

Trinity also has won national championships in women&#x27;s basketball (spring 2003) and men&#x27;s soccer (fall 2003). Club sports include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, lacrosse, water polo, fencing, ultimate frisbee, and trap and skeet.

<text>The Donghae Nambu Line () is a railway line connecting Busan to Pohang in South Korea. The line runs along South Korea&#x27;s east coast. On December 30, 2016, it was merged into Donghae Line.

==History==
On October 31, 1918, an extension of the Daegu Line reached Pohang. The section from Gyeongju to Pohang would become the oldest part of the future Donghae Nambu Line. On October 25, 1921, a branch of the Daegu Line from Gyeongju to Ulsan (Taehwagang) was opened. On December 16, 1935, Busan and Ulsan were linked up through the opening of the section Jwacheon–Ulsan. The new line and the two older sections built as part of the Daegu Line were combined into the new Donghae Nambu Line, with a length of from Busanjin to Pohang.

===Upgrade===
As of 2010, most of the line remains single-track and unelectrified. The entire line is to be upgraded to an electrified-double-tracked railway.

====Busan–Ulsan====
Planning for the upgrading of the line started in 1990 already, with the primary aim to improve commuter traffic; construction started in June 2003. The section gets a new 72.1 km long alignment with several tunnels. Korea Rail Network Authority, Busan, and Ulsan city government is undertaking the upgrade. As of 2010, construction progress reached 32% of the total budget of 2,268.9 billion won. The completion of the upgrade is foreseen for 2015.

On September 1, 2010, the South Korean government announced a strategic plan to reduce travel times from Seoul to 95% of the country to under 2 hours by 2020. As part of the plan, the Busan–Ulsan section of the Donghae Nambu Line is to be further upgraded for 230 km/h.

====Ulsan–Gyeongju–Pohang====

The line is to be replaced by a completely new alignment that circumvents downtown Gyeongju and connects to the Gyeongbu high-speed railway at Gyeongju station. In 2003, a feasibility study was prepared for the section. Detailed design was started, and in May 2007, the government expected to realise the project from 2008 to 2011 at the earliest. The project was finally approved by the government on April 23, 2009, and a ground-breaking ceremony was held. The altogether 76.56 km line was slated to be opened in December 2014, with a total budget of 2,328.899 billion won. In January 2010, the early completion of the Pohang branch was confirmed by the government.

==Stations==

Major stations and junctions along the line include (in order):

*Busan station, terminus of the Gyeongbu Line;
*Busanjin station, also on the Gyeongbu Line, just north of Busan Station;
*Beomil station, terminus of the Gaya Line;
*Bujeon station, terminus of the Bujeon Line;
*Dongnae station
*Sinhaeundae station, a popular resort beach in eastern Busan;
*Gijang station
*Namchang station, terminus of the Onsan Line;
*Taehwagang station (formerly Ulsan), major industrial city and terminus of the Jangsaengpo and Ulsanhang Lines;
*Gyeongju station, historic city and terminus of the Jungang Line;
*Hyoja station, terminus of the Goedong Line; and
*Pohang station, seaport and industrial city.

==Services==

The line sees passenger and freight traffic. As of October 2010, from Bujeon station in Busan, cross-country Mugunghwa-ho trains travel in around 1 hour 25 minutes to Ulsan and in around 2 hours 40 minutes to Pohang. Via the Gyeongbu, Daegu and Jungang Lines, Pohang and Ulsan are connected to Seoul with both intercity Saemaul-ho and cross-country Mugunghwa-ho services. As of 2010, the shortest travel times from Seoul to Pohang are around 5 hours 15 minutes by direct Saemaul service and around 3 hours 40 minutes with transfer to KTX trains at Dongdaegu.

After its upgrade is finished, the role of the line as a corridor for freight traffic will be enhanced.

== Reuse abandoned old railroad of Donghae Nambu Line ==

This is an abandoned railroad. Between Ulsan and Busan Donghae Nambu Line a scrapped ship to utilize the space between East-Busan resort complex and that they would work together to Haeundae with connecting the invigoration of the local economy by creating a tourist resources. Haeundae Olympic Intersections created a green rail road that runs through Haeundae Station, the coastal spectacular Mi-po, Cheongsa-po, and Gudeok-po to provide pleasant and energetic spaces for tourists and local residents visiting Haeundae Beach.

=== Project ===

# Busan Green Rail Way Project 1 - Section is from Haeundae Olympic Junction to Busan Mechanical Technical High School. Period is from Sep 23. 2015 to Dec. 29. 2016. Budget of this step is 3.41 Billion KRW.
# Busan Green Rail Way Project 2 - Section is from Busan Mechanical Technical High School to East Busan Tourist District Entrance. Period is from Jun. 27. 2016 to Dec. 11. 2017. Budget of this step is 8.1 Billion KRW.

<text>Internal conversion is an atomic decay process where an excited nucleus interacts electromagnetically with one of the orbital electrons of an atom. This causes the electron to be emitted (ejected) from the atom. Thus, in internal conversion (often abbreviated IC), a high-energy electron is emitted from the excited atom, but not from the nucleus. For this reason, the high-speed electrons resulting from internal conversion are not called beta particles, since the latter come from beta decay, where they are newly created in the nuclear decay process.

IC is possible whenever gamma decay is possible, except if the atom is fully ionized. In IC, the atomic number does not change, and thus there is no transmutation of one element to another. Also, neutrinos and the weak force are not involved in IC.

Since an electron is lost from the atom, a hole appears in an electron aura which is subsequently filled by other electrons that descend to the empty, yet lower energy level, and in the process emit characteristic X-ray(s), Auger electron(s), or both. The atom thus emits high-energy electrons and X-ray photons, none of which originate in that nucleus. The atom supplies the energy needed to eject the electron, which in turn causes the latter events and the other emissions.

Since primary electrons from IC carry a fixed (large) part of the characteristic decay energy, they have a discrete energy spectrum, rather than the spread (continuous) spectrum characteristic of beta particles. Whereas the energy spectrum of beta particles plots as a broad hump, the energy spectrum of internally converted electrons plots as a single sharp peak (see example below).

==Mechanism==
In the quantum model of the electron, there is non-zero probability of finding the electron within the nucleus. In internal conversion, the wavefunction of an inner shell electron (usually an &quot;s&quot; electron) penetrates the nucleus. When this happens, the electron may couple to an excited energy state of the nucleus and take the energy of the nuclear transition directly, without an intermediate gamma ray being first produced. The kinetic energy of the emitted electron is equal to the transition energy in the nucleus, minus the binding energy of the electron to the atom.

Most IC electrons come from the K shell (the 1s state), as these two electrons have the highest probability of being within the nucleus. However, the s states in the L, M, and N shells (i.e., the 2s, 3s, and 4s states) are also able to couple to the nuclear fields and cause IC electron ejections from those shells (called L or M or N internal conversion). Ratios of K-shell to other L, M, or N shell internal conversion probabilities for various nuclides have been prepared.

An amount of energy exceeding the atomic binding energy of the s electron must be supplied to that electron in order to eject it from the atom to result in IC; that is to say, internal conversion cannot happen if the decay energy of the nucleus is less than a certain threshold.

Though s electrons are more likely for IC due to their superior nuclear penetration compared to electrons with greater orbital angular momentum, spectral studies show that p electrons (from shells L and higher) are occasionally ejected in the IC process. There are also a few radionuclides in which the decay energy is not sufficient to convert (eject) a 1s (K shell) electron, and these nuclides, to decay by internal conversion, must decay by ejecting electrons from the L or M or N shells (i.e., by ejecting 2s, 3s, or 4s electrons) as these binding energies are lower.

After the IC electron is emitted, the atom is left with a vacancy in one of its electron shells, usually an inner one. This hole will be filled with an electron from one of the higher shells, which causes another outer electron to fill its place in turn, causing a cascade. Consequently, one or more characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons will be emitted as the remaining electrons in the atom cascade down to fill the vacancies.

==Example: decay of Hg==

The decay scheme on the left shows that Hg produces a continuous beta spectrum with maximum energy 214 keV, that leads to an excited state of the daughter nucleus Tl. This state decays very quickly (within 2.8×10 s) to the ground state of Tl, emitting a gamma quantum of 279 keV.

The figure on the right shows the electron spectrum of Hg, measured by means of a magnetic spectrometer. It includes the continuous beta spectrum and K-, L-, and M-lines due to internal conversion. Since the binding energy of the K electrons in Tl is 85 keV, the K line has an energy of 279 − 85 = 194 keV. Due to lesser binding energies, the L- and M-lines have higher energies. Due to the finite energy resolution of the spectrometer, the &quot;lines&quot; have a Gaussian shape of finite width.

==When the process is expected==
Internal conversion is favored whenever the energy available for a gamma transition is small, and it is also the primary mode of de-excitation for 0→0 (i.e. E0) transitions. The 0→0 transitions occur where an excited nucleus has zero-spin and positive parity, and decays to a ground state which also has zero-spin and positive parity (such as all nuclides with even number of protons and neutrons). In such cases, de-excitation cannot take place by emission of a gamma ray, since this would violate conservation of angular momentum, hence other mechanisms like IC predominate. This also shows that internal conversion (contrary to its name) is not a two-step process where a gamma ray would be first emitted and then converted.

The competition between IC and gamma decay is quantified in the form of the internal conversion coefficient which is defined as formula_1 where formula_2 is the rate of conversion electrons and formula_3 is the rate of gamma-ray emission observed from a decaying nucleus. For example, in the decay of the excited state at 35 keV of Te (which is produced by the decay of I), 7% of decays emit energy as a gamma ray, while 93% release energy as conversion electrons. Therefore, this excited state of has an IC coefficient of formula_4.

For increasing atomic number (Z) and decreasing gamma-ray energy, IC coefficients increase. For example, calculated IC coefficients for electric dipole (E1) transitions, for Z = 40, 60, and 80, are shown in the figure.

The energy of the emitted gamma ray is a precise measure of the difference in energy between the excited states of the decaying nucleus. In the case of conversion electrons, the binding energy must also be taken into account: The energy of a conversion electron is given as formula_5, where formula_6 and formula_7 are the energies of the nucleus in its initial and final states, respectively, while formula_8 is the binding energy of the electron.

==Similar processes==
Nuclei with zero-spin and high excitation energies (more than about 1.022 MeV) also can&#x27;t rid themselves of energy by (single) gamma emission due to the constraint imposed by conservation of momentum, but they do have enough decay energy to decay by pair production. In this type of decay, an electron and positron are both emitted from the atom at the same time, and conservation of angular momentum is solved by having these two product particles spin in opposite directions.

IC should not be confused with the similar photoelectric effect. When a gamma ray emitted by the nucleus of an atom hits another atom, it may be absorbed producing a photoelectron of well-defined energy (this used to be called &quot;external conversion&quot;). In IC, however, the process happens within one atom, and without a real intermediate gamma ray.

Just as an atom may produce an IC electron instead of a gamma ray if energy is available from within the nucleus, so an atom may produce an Auger electron instead of an X-ray if an electron is missing from one of the low-lying electron shells. (The first process can even precipitate the second one.) Like IC electrons, Auger electrons have a discrete energy, resulting in a sharp energy peak in the spectrum.

Electron capture also involves an inner shell electron, which in this case is retained in the nucleus (changing the atomic number) and leaving the atom (not nucleus) in an excited state. The atom missing an inner electron can relax by a cascade of X-ray emissions as higher energy electrons in the atom fall to fill the vacancy left in the electron cloud by the captured electron. Such atoms also typically exhibit Auger electron emission. Electron capture, like beta decay, also typically results in excited atomic nuclei, which may then relax to a state of lowest nuclear energy by any of the methods permitted by spin constraints, including gamma decay and internal conversion decay.

<text>Video camera tubes are devices based on the cathode-ray tube that were used in television cameras to capture television images, prior to the introduction of charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors in the 1980s. Several different types of tubes were in use from the early 1930s, and as late as the 1990s.

In these tubes, an electron beam is scanned across an image of the scene to be broadcast focused on a target. This generated a current that is dependent on the brightness of the image on the target at the scan point. The size of the striking ray is tiny compared to the size of the target, allowing 480–486 horizontal scan lines per image in the NTSC format, 576 lines in PAL, and as many as 1035 lines in Hi-Vision.

==Cathode-ray tube==

Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons, originally called cathode rays, is known as a cathode-ray tube (CRT). These are usually seen as display devices as used in older (i.e., non-flat panel) television receivers and computer displays. The camera pickup tubes described in this article are also CRTs, but they display no image.

==Early research==
In June 1908, the scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published a letter in which Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), discussed how a fully electronic television system could be realized by using cathode-ray tubes (or &quot;Braun&quot; tubes, after their inventor, Karl Braun) as both imaging and display devices. He noted that the &quot;real difficulties lie in devising an efficient transmitter&quot;, and that it was possible that &quot;no photoelectric phenomenon at present known will provide what is required&quot;. A cathode-ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906; his experimental results were published by the journal &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1909. Campbell-Swinton later expanded on his vision in a presidential address given to the Röntgen Society in November 1911. The photoelectric screen in the proposed transmitting device was a mosaic of isolated rubidium cubes. His concept for a fully electronic television system was later popularized as the &quot;Campbell-Swinton Electronic Scanning System&quot; by Hugo Gernsback and H. Winfield Secor in the August 1915 issue of the popular magazine &quot;Electrical Experimenter&quot; and by Marcus J. Martin in the 1921 book &quot;The Electrical Transmission of Photographs&quot;.

In a letter to &quot;Nature&quot; published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some &quot;not very successful experiments&quot; he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died, but they were later repeated by two different teams in 1937, by H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and by H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting &quot;very faint&quot; images with the original Campbell-Swinton&#x27;s selenium-coated plate, but much better images were obtained when the metal plate was covered with zinc sulphide or selenide, or with aluminum or zirconium oxide treated with caesium. These experiments would form the base of the future vidicon. A description of a CRT imaging device also appeared in a patent application filed by Edvard-Gustav Schoultz in France in August 1921, and published in 1922, although a working device was not demonstrated until some years later.

==Experiments with image dissectors==
An image dissector is a camera tube that creates an &quot;electron image&quot; of a scene from photocathode emissions (electrons) which pass through a scanning aperture to an anode, which serves as an electron detector. Among the first to design such a device were German inventors Max Dieckmann and Rudolf Hell, who had titled their 1925 patent application &quot;Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher&quot; (&quot;Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television&quot;). The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, an element lacking in Dieckmann and Hell&#x27;s design, and in the early dissector tubes built by American inventor Philo Farnsworth.

Dieckmann and Hell submitted their application to the German patent office in April 1925, and a patent was issued in October 1927. Their experiments on the image dissector were announced in September 1927 issue of the popular magazine &quot;Discovery&quot; and in the May 1928 issue of the magazine &quot;Popular Radio&quot;. However, they never transmitted a clear and well focused image with such a tube.

In January 1927, American inventor and television pioneer Philo T. Farnsworth applied for a patent for his &quot;Television System&quot; that included a device for &quot;the conversion and dissecting of light&quot;.
Its first moving image was successfully transmitted on September 7 of 1927,
and a patent was issued in 1930. Farnsworth quickly made improvements to the device, among them introducing an electron multiplier made of nickel and using a &quot;longitudinal magnetic field&quot; in order to sharply focus the electron image.
The improved device was demonstrated to the press in early September 1928.
The introduction of a multipactor in October 1933 and a multi-dynode &quot;electron multiplier&quot; in 1937 made Farnsworth&#x27;s image dissector the first practical version of a fully electronic imaging device for television. It had very poor light sensitivity, and was therefore primarily useful only where illumination was exceptionally high (typically over 685 cd/m2). However, it was ideal for industrial applications, such as monitoring the bright interior of an industrial furnace. Due to their poor light sensitivity, image dissectors were rarely used in television broadcasting, except to scan film and other transparencies.

In April 1933, Farnsworth submitted a patent application also entitled &quot;Image Dissector&quot;, but which actually detailed a CRT-type camera tube. This is among the first patents to propose the use of a &quot;low-velocity&quot; scanning beam and RCA had to buy it in order to sell image orthicon tubes to the general public. However, Farnsworth never transmitted a clear and well focused image with such a tube.

Dissectors were used only briefly for research in television systems before being replaced by different much more sensitive tubes based on the charge-storage phenomenon like the iconoscope during the 1930s. Although camera tubes based on the idea of image dissector technology quickly and completely fell out of use in the field of television broadcasting, they continued to be used for imaging in early weather satellites and the Lunar lander, and for star attitude tracking in the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.

===Operation===
The optical system of the image dissector focuses an image onto a photocathode mounted inside a high vacuum. As light strikes the photocathode, electrons are emitted in proportion to the intensity of the light (see photoelectric effect). The entire electron image is deflected and a scanning aperture permits only those electrons emanating from a very small area of the photocathode to be captured by the detector at any given time. The output from the detector is an electric current whose magnitude is a measure of the brightness of the corresponding area of the image. The electron image is periodically deflected horizontally and vertically (&quot;raster scanning&quot;) such that the entire image is read by the detector many times per second, producing an electrical signal that can be conveyed to a display device, such as a CRT monitor, to reproduce the image.

The image dissector has no &quot;charge storage&quot; characteristic; the vast majority of electrons emitted by the photocathode are excluded by the scanning aperture, and thus wasted rather than being stored on a photo-sensitive target.

==Charge-storage tubes==
===Iconoscope===

The early electronic camera tubes (like the image dissector) suffered from a very disappointing and fatal flaw: They scanned the subject and what was seen at each point was only the tiny piece of light viewed at the instant that the scanning system passed over it. A practical functional camera tube needed a different technological approach, which later became known as Charge - Storage camera tube. It was based on a new physical phenomenon which was discovered and patented in Hungary in 1926, but became widely understood and recognised only from around 1930.

An iconoscope is a camera tube that projects an image on a special charge storage plate containing a mosaic of electrically isolated photosensitive granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, somewhat analogous to the human eye&#x27;s retina and its arrangement of photoreceptors. Each photosensitive granule constitutes a tiny capacitor that accumulates and stores electrical charge in response to the light striking it. An electron beam periodically sweeps across the plate, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the light striking it between each discharge event.

After Hungarian engineer Kálmán Tihanyi studied Maxwell&#x27;s equations, he discovered a new hitherto unknown physical phenomenon, which led to a break-through in the development of electronic imaging devices. He named the new phenomenon as charge-storage principle. (further information: Charge-storage principle)
The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or camera tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by Tihanyi in the beginning of 1925. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (photoelectrons) within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed Radioskop. After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi&#x27;s patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930, and so he applied for patents in the United States. Tihanyi&#x27;s charge storage idea remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.

In 1924, while employed by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Russian-born American engineer Vladimir Zworykin presented a project for a totally electronic television system to the company&#x27;s general manager. In July 1925, Zworykin submitted a patent application titled &quot;Television System&quot; that included a charge storage plate constructed of a thin layer of isolating material (aluminum oxide) sandwiched between a screen (300 mesh) and a colloidal deposit of photoelectric material (potassium hydride) consisting of isolated globules. The following description can be read between lines 1 and 9 in page 2: &quot;The photoelectric material, such as potassium hydride, is evaporated on the aluminum oxide, or other insulating medium, and treated so as to form a colloidal deposit of potassium hydride consisting of minute globules. Each globule is very active photoelectrically and constitutes, to all intents and purposes, a minute individual photoelectric cell&quot;. Its first image was transmitted in late summer of 1925, and a patent was issued in 1928. However the quality of the transmitted image failed to impress H.P. Davis, the general manager of Westinghouse, and Zworykin was asked &quot;to work on something useful&quot;. A patent for a television system was also filed by Zworykin in 1923, but this filing is not a definitive reference because extensive revisions were done before a patent was issued fifteen years later and the file itself was divided into two patents in 1931.

The first practical iconoscope was constructed in 1931 by Sanford Essig, when he accidentally left a silvered mica sheet in the oven too long. Upon examination with a microscope, he noticed that the silver layer had broken up into a myriad of tiny isolated silver globules. He also noticed that, &quot;the tiny dimension of the silver droplets would enhance the image resolution of the iconoscope by a quantum leap&quot;. As head of television development at Radio Corporation of America (RCA), Zworykin submitted a patent application in November 1931, and it was issued in 1935. Nevertheless, Zworykin&#x27;s team was not the only engineering group working on devices that used a charge storage plate. In 1932, the EMI engineers Tedham and McGee under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg applied for a patent for a new device they dubbed the &quot;Emitron&quot;. A 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace in 1936, and patents were issued in the United Kingdom in 1934 and in the US in 1937.

The iconoscope was presented to the general public at a press conference in June 1933, and two detailed technical papers were published in September and October of the same year. Unlike the Farnsworth image dissector, the Zworykin iconoscope was much more sensitive, useful with an illumination on the target between 40and215lux (4–20 ft-c). It was also easier to manufacture and produced a very clear image. The iconoscope was the primary camera tube used by RCA broadcasting from 1936 until 1946, when it was replaced by the image orthicon tube.

===Super-Emitron and image iconoscope===
The original iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the Emitron (or iconoscope) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. This is because secondary electrons released from the mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam sweeps across it may be attracted back to the positively charged mosaic, thus neutralizing many of the stored charges. Lubszynski, Rodda, and McGee realized that the best solution was to separate the photo-emission function from the charge storage one, and so communicated their results to Zworykin.

The new video camera tube developed by Lubszynski, Rodda and McGee in 1934 was dubbed &quot;the super-Emitron&quot;. This tube is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. It has an efficient photocathode that transforms the scene light into an electron image; the latter is then accelerated towards a target specially prepared for the emission of secondary electrons. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the secondary emission is stored in the granules. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image, discharging each granule, and producing an electronic signal like in the iconoscope.

The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcast by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings.

On the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their &quot;Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher&quot; (&quot;Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television&quot;) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States.

The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 until 1963, when it was replaced by the much better Plumbicon.

====Operation====
The super-Emitron is a combination of the image dissector and the Emitron. The scene image is projected onto an efficient continuous-film semitransparent photocathode that transforms the scene light into a light-emitted electron image, the latter is then accelerated (and focused) via electromagnetic fields towards a target specially prepared for the emission of secondary electrons. Each individual electron from the electron image produces several secondary electrons after reaching the target, so that an amplification effect is produced, and the resulting positive charge is proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The target is constructed of a mosaic of electrically isolated metallic granules separated from a common plate by a thin layer of isolating material, so that the positive charge resulting from the secondary emission is stored in the capacitor formed by the metallic granule and the common plate. Finally, an electron beam periodically sweeps across the target, effectively scanning the stored image and discharging each capacitor in turn such that the electrical output from each capacitor is proportional to the average intensity of the scene light between each discharge event (as in the iconoscope).

The image iconoscope is essentially identical to the super-Emitron, but the target is constructed of a thin layer of isolating material placed on top of a conductive base, the mosaic of metallic granules is missing. Therefore, secondary electrons are emitted from the surface of the isolating material when the electron image reaches the target, and the resulting positive charges are stored directly onto the surface of the isolated material.

===Orthicon and CPS Emitron===
The original iconoscope was very noisy due to the secondary electrons released from the photoelectric mosaic of the charge storage plate when the scanning beam swept it across. An obvious solution was to scan the mosaic with a low-velocity electron beam which produced less energy in the neighborhood of the plate such that no secondary electrons were emitted at all. That is, an image is projected onto the photoelectric mosaic of a charge storage plate, so that positive charges are produced and stored there due to photo-emission and capacitance, respectively. These stored charges are then gently discharged by a &quot;low-velocity electron scanning beam&quot;, preventing the emission of secondary electrons. Not all the electrons in the scanning beam may be absorbed in the mosaic, because the stored positive charges are proportional to the integrated intensity of the scene light. The remaining electrons are then deflected back into the anode, captured by a special grid, or deflected back into an electron multiplier.

&quot;Low-velocity scanning beam&quot; tubes have several advantages; there are low levels of spurious signals and high efficiency of conversion of light into signal, so that the signal output is maximum. However, there are serious problems as well, because the electron beam spreads and accelerates in a direction parallel to the target when it scans the image&#x27;s borders and corners, so that it produces secondary electrons and one gets an image that is well focused in the center but blurry in the borders. Henroteau was among the first inventors to propose in 1929 the use of &quot;low-velocity electrons&quot; for stabilizing the potential of a charge storage plate, but Lubszynski and the EMI team were the first engineers in transmitting a clear and well focused image with such a tube. Another improvement is the use of a semitransparent charge storage plate. The scene image is then projected onto the back side of the plate, while the low-velocity electron beam scans the photoelectric mosaic at the front side. This configurations allows the use of a straight camera tube, because the scene to be transmitted, the charge storage plate, and the electron gun can be aligned one after the other.
The first fully functional low-velocity scanning beam tube, the CPS Emitron, was invented and demonstrated by the EMI team under the supervision of Sir Isaac Shoenberg. In 1934, the EMI engineers Blumlein and McGee filed for patents for &quot;television transmitting systems&quot; where a charge storage plate was shielded by a pair of special grids, a negative (or slightly positive) grid lay very close to the plate, and a positive one was placed further away. The velocity and energy of the electrons in the scanning beam were reduced to zero by the decelerating electric field generated by this pair of grids, and so a low-velocity scanning beam tube was obtained. The EMI team kept working on these devices, and Lubszynski discovered in 1936 that a clear image could be produced if the trajectory of the low-velocity scanning beam was nearly perpendicular (orthogonal) to the charge storage plate in a neighborhood of it. The resulting device was dubbed the cathode potential stabilized Emitron, or CPS Emitron. The industrial production and commercialization of the CPS Emitron had to wait until the end of the Second World War; it was widely used in the UK until 1963, when it was replaced by the much better Plumbicon.

On the other side of the Atlantic, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1935 on a low-velocity scanning beam device they came to dub the orthicon. Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and deflection coils near the charge storage plate to provide a uniform axial magnetic field. The orthicon&#x27;s performance was similar to that of the image iconoscope, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing &quot;the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene&quot;.

===Image orthicon===

The image orthicon (sometimes abbreviated IO), was common in American broadcasting from 1946 until 1968. A combination of the image dissector and the orthicon technologies, it replaced the iconoscope in the United States, which required a great deal of light to work adequately.

The image orthicon tube was developed at RCA by Albert Rose, Paul K. Weimer, and Harold B. Law. It represented a considerable advance in the television field, and after further development work, RCA created original models between 1939 and 1940. The National Defense Research Committee entered into a contract with RCA where the NDRC paid for its further development. Upon RCA&#x27;s development of the more sensitive image orthicon tube in 1943, RCA entered into a production contract with the U.S. Navy, the first tubes being delivered in January 1944. RCA began production of image orthicons for civilian use in the second quarter of 1946.

While the iconoscope and the intermediate orthicon used capacitance between a multitude of small but discrete light sensitive collectors and an isolated signal plate for reading video information, the image orthicon employed direct charge readings from a continuous electronically charged collector. The resultant signal was immune to most extraneous signal crosstalk from other parts of the target, and could yield extremely detailed images. Image orthicon cameras were still being used by NASA for capturing Apollo/Saturn rockets nearing orbit, although the television networks had phased the cameras out. 

An image orthicon camera can take television pictures by candlelight because of the more ordered light-sensitive area and the presence of an electron multiplier at the base of the tube, which operated as a high-efficiency amplifier. It also has a logarithmic light sensitivity curve similar to the human eye. However, it tends to flare in bright light, causing a dark halo to be seen around the object; this anomaly was referred to as blooming in the broadcast industry when image orthicon tubes were in operation. Image orthicons were used extensively in the early color television cameras such as the RCA TK-40/41, where the increased sensitivity of the tube was essential to overcome the very inefficient, beam-splitting optical system of the camera.

The image orthicon tube was at one point colloquially referred to as an Immy. Harry Lubcke, the then-President of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, decided to have their award named after this nickname. Since the statuette was female, it was feminized into Emmy. The Image orthicon was used until the end of black and white television production in the 1960s.

====Operation====
An image orthicon consists of three parts: a photocathode with an image store (target), a scanner that reads this image (an electron gun), and a multistage electron multiplier.

In the image store, light falls upon the photocathode which is a photosensitive plate at a very negative potential (approx. -600 V), and is converted into an electron image (a principle borrowed from the image dissector). This electron rain is then accelerated towards the target (a very thin glass plate acting as a semi-isolator) at ground potential (0 V), and passes through a very fine wire mesh (nearly 200 or 390 wires per cm), very near (a few hundredths of a cm) and parallel to the target, acting as a screen grid at a slightly positive voltage (approx +2 V). Once the image electrons reach the target, they cause a splash of electrons by the effect of secondary emission. On average, each image electron ejects several splash electrons (thus adding amplification by secondary emission), and these excess electrons are soaked up by the positive mesh effectively removing electrons from the target and causing a positive charge on it in relation to the incident light in the photocathode. The result is an image painted in positive charge, with the brightest portions having the largest positive charge.

A sharply focused beam of electrons (a cathode ray) is generated by the electron gun at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first dynode of the electron multiplier) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500 V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam move away from the dynode towards the back side of the target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the axial magnetic field of the focusing coil, this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode-ray tube toward the first dynode of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target&#x27;s original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.

====Dark halo====

The mysterious dark &quot;orthicon halo&quot; around bright objects in an orthicon-captured image (also known as &quot;blooming&quot;) is based on the fact that the IO relies on the emission of photoelectrons, but very bright illumination can produce more of them locally than the device can successfully deal with. At a very bright point on a captured image, a great preponderance of electrons is ejected from the photosensitive plate. So many may be ejected that the corresponding point on the collection mesh can no longer soak them up, and thus they fall back to nearby spots on the target instead, much as water splashes in a ring when a rock is thrown into it. Since the resultant splashed electrons do not contain sufficient energy to eject further electrons where they land, they will instead neutralize any positive charge that has been built-up in that region. Since darker images produce less positive charge on the target, the excess electrons deposited by the splash will be read as a dark region by the scanning electron beam.

This effect was actually cultivated by tube manufacturers to a certain extent, as a small, carefully controlled amount of the dark halo has the effect of crispening the visual image due to the contrast effect. (That is, giving the illusion of being more sharply focused than it actually is). The later vidicon tube and its descendants (see below) do not exhibit this effect, and so could not be used for broadcast purposes until special detail correction circuitry could be developed.

===Vidicon===
A vidicon tube is a video camera tube design in which the target material is a photoconductor. The vidicon was developed in 1950 at RCA by P. K. Weimer, S. V. Forgue and R. R. Goodrich as a simple alternative to the structurally and electrically complex image orthicon. While the initial photoconductor used was selenium, other targets—including silicon diode arrays—have been used. Vidicons with these targets are known as Si-vidicons or Ultricons.

The vidicon is a storage-type camera tube in which a charge-density pattern is formed by the imaged scene radiation on a photoconductive surface which is then scanned by a beam of low-velocity electrons. This surface is on a glass plate and is also called the target. More specifically, this glass plate is covered in a transparent, electrically conductive, indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, on top of which the photoconductive surface is formed by depositing photoconductive material which can be applied as small squares with insulation between the squares. The photoconductor is normally an insulator but becomes partially conductive when struck by electrons. The output of the tube comes from the ITO layer.

The target is kept at a positive voltage of 30 volts and the cathode in the tube is at a voltage of negative 30 volts. The cathode releases electrons which are modulated by grid G1 and accelerated by grid G2 creating an electron beam. Magnetic coils deflect, focus, and align the electron beam so it can scan the surface of the target. The beam deposits electrons on the target and when enough photons strike the target, a difference in current is produced between the two electrically conductive layers of the target, and due to a connection to an electrical resistor this difference is output as a voltage. The fluctuating voltage created in the target is coupled to a video amplifier and used to reproduce the scene being imaged, in other words it is the video output. The electrical charge produced by an image will remain in the face plate until it is scanned or until the charge dissipates. Special Vidicons can have resolutions of up to 5,000 TV lines.

By using a pyroelectric material such as triglycine sulfate (TGS) as the target, a vidicon sensitive over a broad portion of the infrared spectrum is possible. This technology was a precursor to modern microbolometer technology, and mainly used in firefighting thermal cameras.
Prior to the design and construction of the Galileo probe to Jupiter, in the late 1970s to early 1980s NASA used vidicon cameras on nearly all the unmanned deep space probes equipped with the remote sensing ability. Vidicon tubes were also used aboard the first three Landsat earth imaging satellites launched in 1972, as part of each spacecraft&#x27;s Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) imaging system. The Uvicon, a UV-variant Vidicon was also used by NASA for UV duties.

Vidicon tubes were popular in 1970s and 1980s, after which they were rendered obsolete by solid-state image sensors, with the charge-coupled device (CCD) and then the CMOS sensor.

All vidicon and similar tubes are prone to image lag, better known as ghosting, smearing, burn-in, comet tails, luma trails and luminance blooming. Image lag is visible as noticeable (usually white or colored) trails that appear after a bright object (such as a light or reflection) has moved, leaving a trail that eventually fades into the image. It cannot be avoided or eliminated, as it is inherent to the technology. To what degree the image generated by the Vidicon is affected will depend on the properties of the target material used on the Vidicon, and the capacitance of the target material (known as the storage effect) as well as the resistance of the electron beam used to scan the target. The higher the capacitance of the target, the higher the charge it can hold and the longer it will take for the trail to disappear. The remmanant charges on the target eventually dissipate making the trail disappear. 

Vidicons can be damaged by high intensity light exposure. Image burn-in occurs when an image is captured by a Vidicon for a long time and appears as a persistent outline of the image when it changes, and the outline disappears over time. Vidicons can become damaged by direct exposure to the sun which causes them to develop dark spots. Vidicons often used antimony trisulfide as the photoconductive material. They were not very successful because of image lag, which was seen in the RCA TK-42 color camera.

====Si-vidicon (1969)====

Si-vidicons, silicon vidicons or Epicons, Vidicons using arrays of silicon diodes for the target, were introduced in 1969 for the Picturephone. They are very resistant to burn-in, have low image lag and very high sensitivity but are not considered suitable for broadcast TV production as they suffer from high image blooming and image non uniformity. The targets in these tubes are made on silicon substrates and require 10 volts to operate, they are made with semiconductor device fabrication processes. These tubes could be used with an image intensifier in which case they were known as silicon intensified tubes (SITs) which had an additional photocathode in front of the target that produced large amounts of electrons when struck by photons, and the electrons were accelerated to the target with several hundred volts. These tubes were used for tracking satellite debris.

====Plumbicon (1965)====

Plumbicon is a registered trademark of Philips from 1963, for its lead(II) oxide (PbO) target vidicons. It was demonstrated in 1965 at the NAB Show. Used frequently in broadcast camera applications, these tubes have low output, but a high signal-to-noise ratio. They have excellent resolution compared to image orthicons, but lack the artificially sharp edges of IO tubes, which cause some of the viewing audience to perceive them as softer. CBS Labs invented the first outboard edge enhancement circuits to sharpen the edges of Plumbicon generated images.
Philips received the 1966 Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award for the Plumbicon. Targets in Plumbicons have two layers: a pure PbO layer, and a doped PbO layer. The pure PbO is an intrinsic I type semiconductor, and a layer of it is doped to create a P type PbO semiconductor, thus creating a semiconductor junction. The PbO is in crystalline form.

Plumbicons were the first commercially successful version of the Vidicon. They were smaller, had lower noise, higher sensitivity and resolution, had less image lag than Vidicons, and were a defining factor in the development of color TV cameras. The most widely used camera tubes in TV production were the Plumbicons and the Saticon.
Compared to Saticons, Plumbicons have much higher resistance to burn-in, and comet and trailing artifacts from bright lights in the shot. Saticons though, usually have slightly higher resolution. After 1980, and the introduction of the diode-gun Plumbicon tube, the resolution of both types was so high, compared to the maximum limits of the broadcasting standard, that the Saticon&#x27;s resolution advantage became moot. While broadcast cameras migrated to solid-state charge-coupled devices, Plumbicon tubes remained a staple imaging device in the medical field. High resolution Plumbicons were made for the HD-MAC standard. Since PbO is not stable in air, the deposition of PbO on the target is challenging. Vistacons developed by RCA and Leddicons made by EEV also use PbO in their targets.

Until 2016, Narragansett Imaging was the last company making Plumbicons, using factories Philips built in Rhode Island, USA. While still a part of Philips, the company purchased EEV&#x27;s (English Electric Valve) lead oxide camera tube business, and gained a monopoly in lead-oxide tube production. Lead oxide tubes were also made by Matsushita.

====Saticon (1973)====
Saticon is a registered trademark of Hitachi from 1973, also produced by Thomson and Sony. It was developed in a joint effort by Hitachi and NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories (NHK is The Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Introduced in 1973, Its surface consists of selenium with trace amounts of arsenic and tellurium added (SeAsTe) to make the signal more stable. SAT in the name is derived from (SeAsTe). Saticon tubes have an average light sensitivity equivalent to that of 64 ASA film. Compared to the Plumbicon it has a less advantageous operating temperature range and has more image lag. The target in a Saticon has a transparent Tin oxide transparent electrically conductive layer, followed by a SeAsTe layer, a SeAs layer, and an Antimony trisulfide layer which faces the electron beam. 

A high-gain avalanche rushing amorphous photoconductor (HARP) made of amorphous Selenium (a-Se) can be used to increase light sensitivity to up to 10 times that of conventional saticons, and Saticons with this kind of target are known as HARPICONs. The target in HARPICONs is made up of ITO (indium-tin oxide), CeO2 (Cerium oxide), Selenium doped with Arsenic and Lithium Fluoride, Selenium doped with Arsenic and Tellurium, amorphous Selenium made by doping it with Arsenic, and antimony trisulfide. Saticons were made for the Sony HDVS system, used to produce early analog high-definition television using multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding (MUSE).

====Pasecon (1972)====
Originally developed by Toshiba in 1972 as chalnicon, Pasecon is a registered trademark of Heimann GmbH from 1977. Its surface consists of cadmium selenide trioxide (CdSeO3). Due to its wide spectral response, it is labelled as &quot;panchromatic selenium vidicon&quot;, hence the acronym &#x27;pasecon&#x27;. It is not considered suitable for broadcast TV production, as it suffers from high image lag.

====Newvicon (1974)====
Newvicon is a registered trademark of Matsushita from 1973. Introduced in 1974, The Newvicon tubes were characterized by high light sensitivity. Its surface consists of a combination of zinc selenide (ZnSe) and zinc cadmium Telluride (ZnCdTe). It is not considered suitable for broadcast TV production, as it suffers from high image lag and non uniformity.

====Trinicon (1971)====
Trinicon is a registered trademark of Sony from 1971. It uses a vertically striped RGB color filter over the faceplate of an otherwise standard vidicon imaging tube to segment the scan into corresponding red, green and blue segments. Only one tube was used in the camera, instead of a tube for each color, as was standard for color cameras used in television broadcasting. It is used mostly in low-end consumer cameras, such as the HVC-2200 and HVC-2400 models, though Sony also used it in some moderate cost professional cameras in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the DXC-1600 series.

Although the idea of using color stripe filters over the target was not new, the Trinicon was the only tube to use the primary RGB colors. This necessitated an additional electrode buried in the target to detect where the scanning electron beam was relative to the stripe filter. Previous color stripe systems had used colors where the color circuitry was able to separate the colors purely from the relative amplitudes of the signals. As a result, the Trinicon featured a larger dynamic range of operation.

Sony later combined the Saticon tube with the Trinicon&#x27;s RGB color filter, providing low-light sensitivity and superior color. This type of tube was known as the SMF Trinicon tube, or Saticon Mixed Field. SMF Trinicon tubes were used in the HVC-2800 and HVC-2500 consumer cameras, the DXC-1800 and BVP-1 professional cameras, as well as the first Betamovie camcorders. Toshiba offered a similar tube in 1974, and Hitachi also developed a similar Saticon with a color filter in 1981.

====Light biasing====
All the vidicon type tubes except the vidicon itself were able to use a light biasing technique to improve the sensitivity and contrast. The photosensitive target in these tubes suffered from the limitation that the light level had to rise to a particular level before any video output resulted. Light biasing was a method whereby the photosensitive target was illuminated from a light source just enough that no appreciable output was obtained, but such that a slight increase in light level from the scene was enough to provide discernible output. The light came from either an illuminator mounted around the target, or in more professional cameras from a light source on the base of the tube and guided to the target by light piping. The technique would not work with the baseline vidicon tube because it suffered from the limitation that as the target was fundamentally an insulator, the constant low light level built up a charge which would manifest itself as a form of fogging. The other types had semiconducting targets which did not have this problem.

===Color cameras===
Early color cameras used the obvious technique of using separate red, green and blue image tubes in conjunction with a color separator, a technique still in use with 3CCD solid state cameras today. It was also possible to construct a color camera that used a single image tube. One technique has already been described (Trinicon above). A more common technique and a simpler one from the tube construction standpoint was to overlay the photosensitive target with a color striped filter having a fine pattern of vertical stripes of green, cyan and clear filters (i.e. green; green and blue; and green, blue and red) repeating across the target. The advantage of this arrangement was that for virtually every color, the video level of the green component was always less than the cyan, and similarly the cyan was always less than the white. Thus the contributing images could be separated without any reference electrodes in the tube. If the three levels were the same, then that part of the scene was green. This method suffered from the disadvantage that the light levels under the three filters were almost certain to be different, with the green filter passing not more than one third of the available light.

Variations on this scheme exist, the principal one being to use two filters with color stripes overlaid such that the colors form vertically oriented lozenge shapes overlaying the target. The method of extracting the color is similar however.

====Field-sequential color system====
During the 1930s and 1940s, field-sequential color systems were developed which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera&#x27;s image tube and at the television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it was in front of the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with vertical scanning so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color. This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images. A field-sequential system developed by Peter Goldmark for CBS was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940, and was first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950. Guillermo González Camarena independently developed a field-sequential color disk system in Mexico in the early 1940s, for which he requested a patent in Mexico on August 19 of 1940 and in the US in 1941. Gonzalez Camarena produced his color television system in his laboratory Gon-Cam for the Mexican market and exported it to the Columbia College of Chicago, who regarded it as the best system in the world.

===Magnetic focusing in typical camera tubes===
The phenomenon known as &quot;magnetic focusing&quot; was discovered by A. A. Campbell-Swinton in 1896. He found that a longitudinal magnetic field generated by an axial coil can focus an electron beam. This phenomenon was immediately corroborated by J. A. Fleming, and Hans Busch gave a complete mathematical interpretation in 1926.

Diagrams in this article show that the focus coil surrounds the camera tube; it is much longer than the focus coils for earlier TV CRTs. Camera-tube focus coils, by themselves, have essentially parallel lines of force, very different from the localized semi-toroidal magnetic field geometry inside a TV receiver CRT focus coil. The latter is essentially a magnetic lens; it focuses the &quot;crossover&quot; (between the CRT&#x27;s cathode and G1 electrode, where the electrons pinch together and diverge again) onto the screen.

The electron optics of camera tubes differ considerably. Electrons inside these long focus coils take helical paths as they travel along the length of the tube. The center (think local axis) of one of those helices is like a line of force of the magnetic field. While the electrons are traveling, the helices essentially don&#x27;t matter. Assuming that they start from a point, the electrons will focus to a point again at a distance determined by the strength of the field. Focusing a tube with this kind of coil is simply a matter of trimming the coil&#x27;s current. In effect, the electrons travel along the lines of force, although helically, in detail.

These focus coils are essentially as long as the tubes themselves, and surround the deflection yoke (coils). Deflection fields bend the lines of force (with negligible defocusing), and the electrons follow the lines of force.

In a conventional magnetically deflected CRT, such as in a TV receiver or computer monitor, basically the vertical deflection coils are equivalent to coils wound around an horizontal axis. That axis is perpendicular to the neck of the tube; lines of force are basically horizontal. (In detail, coils in a deflection yoke extend some distance beyond the neck of the tube, and lie close to the flare of the bulb; they have a truly distinctive appearance.)

In a magnetically focused camera tube (there are electrostatically focused vidicons), the vertical deflection coils are above and below the tube, instead of being on both sides of it. One might say that this sort of deflection starts to create S-bends in the lines of force, but doesn&#x27;t become anywhere near to that extreme.

==Size==
The size of video camera tubes is simply the overall outside diameter of the glass envelope. This differs from the size of the sensitive area of the target which is typically two thirds of the size of the overall diameter. Tube sizes are always expressed in inches for historical reasons. A one-inch camera tube has a sensitive area of approximately two thirds of an inch on the diagonal or about 16 mm.

Although the video camera tube is now technologically obsolete, the size of solid-state image sensors is still expressed as the equivalent size of a camera tube. For this purpose a new term was coined and it is known as the optical format. The optical format is approximately the true diagonal of the sensor multiplied by . The result is expressed in inches and is usually, though not always, rounded to a convenient fraction (hence the approximation). For instance, a sensor has a diagonal of and therefore an optical format of 8.0 × = , which is rounded to the convenient imperial fraction of . The parameter is also the source of the &quot;Four Thirds&quot; in the Four Thirds system and its Micro Four Thirds extension—the imaging area of the sensor in these cameras is approximately that of a video-camera tube at approximately .

Although the optical format size bears no relationship to any physical parameter of the sensor, its use means that a lens that would have been used with (say) a -inch camera tube will give roughly the same angle of view when used with a solid-state sensor with an optical format of of an inch.

==Late use and decline==
The lifespan of videotube technology reached as far as the 90s, when high definition, 1035-line videotubes were used in the early MUSE HD broadcasting system. While CCDs were tested for this application, as of 1993 broadcasters still found them inadequate due to issues achieving the necessary high resolution without compromising image quality with undesirable side-effects.

Modern charge-coupled device (CCD) and CMOS-based sensors offer many advantages over their tube counterparts. These include a lack of image lag, high overall picture quality, high light sensitivity and dynamic range, a better signal-to-noise ratio and significantly higher reliability and ruggedness. Other advantages include the elimination of the respective high and low-voltage power supplies required for the electron beam and heater filament, elimination of the drive circuitry for the focusing coils, no warm-up time and a significantly lower overall power consumption. Despite these advantages, acceptance and incorporation of solid-state sensors into television and video cameras was not immediate. Early sensors were of lower resolution and performance than picture tubes, and were initially relegated to consumer-grade video recording equipment.

Also, video tubes had progressed to a high standard of quality and were standard issue equipment to networks and production entities. Those entities had a substantial investment in not only tube cameras, but also in the ancillary equipment needed to correctly process tube-derived video. A switch-over to solid-state image sensors rendered much of that equipment (and the investments behind it) obsolete and required new equipment optimized to work well with solid-state sensors, just as the old equipment was optimized for tube-sourced video.

Due to their relative insensitivity to radiation, compared to semi-conductor based devices, video camera tubes are still occasionally used in high radiation environments such as nuclear power plants.

<text>Bertha Maria Júlia Lutz (August 2, 1894 – September 16, 1976) was a Brazilian zoologist, politician, and diplomat. Lutz became a leading figure in both the Pan American feminist movement and human rights movement. She was instrumental in gaining women&#x27;s suffrage in Brazil and represented her country at the United Nations Conference on International Organization, signing her name to the United Nations Charter and championing the inclusion of Article 8 in the Charter. In addition to her political work, she was a naturalist at the National Museum of Brazil, specializing in poison dart frogs. She has four frog species and two lizard species named after her.

== Early life and education ==
Bertha Lutz was born on August 2, 1894, in São Paulo, Brazil. She was born to a British mother and a Brazilian father. Her father, Adolfo Lutz (1855–1940), was a pioneering physician and epidemiologist of Swiss origin, and her mother, Amy Marie Gertrude Fowler, was a British nurse. In her teenage years, she grew interested in the women&#x27;s rights. Bertha Lutz studied natural sciences, biology and zoology at the University of Paris – Sorbonne graduating in 1918. Soon after obtaining her degrees, she returned to Brazil. Later, she would attend the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, graduating in 1933 with a law degree. While in Europe, she also was introduced to and inspired by the militant suffrage movement.

==Career==

=== Early Brazilian women&#x27;s organizations ===
Bertha Lutz returned to Brazil in 1918 after her seven-year academic career in Paris. Upon her return, she joined the &quot;Legiao da Mulher Brasilera&quot; (Brazilian Women&#x27;s Legion) as an administrative director of a commission. The established goal of the organization, founded by Alice Rego Monterio in 1919, was to provide organized social services for women in Brazil. After gaining organizational experience, Bertha Lutz cofounded a new organization, the &quot;Liga para a Emancipação Intelectual da Mulher&quot; (The League for Intellectual Emancipation of Women), with Maria Lacerda da Moura in 1920. This organization advocated for the inclusion of women in scientific areas. In 1922, Lutz established &quot;Federação Brasileira pelo Progresso Feminino&quot; (the Brazilian Federation for the Advancement of Women, FBPF). This organization was different as it included women from across Brazil and created a national platform focused on socio-economic issues affecting women. After some time, the FBPF broadened the focus on socio-economic issues to include the right to vote. Within the first year of the FBPF&#x27;s creation, Lutz and other members organized an international convention to take place in Brazil, which was attended by dignitaries within Brazil and from foreign nations, including notable feminists like Carrie Chapman Catt, Ana de Castro Osorio and Rosa Manus.

=== Inter-American feminist and suffrage campaigns ===
The FBPF began advocating for women&#x27;s rights and extending suffrage to women across the American states, campaigns Lutz also participated in. She served as a delegate to the Pan-American Conference of Women in Baltimore, Maryland in 1922, and would continue to attend women&#x27;s rights conferences in the years to follow. In 1925, she was elected president of the Inter-American Union of Women. Lutz&#x27;s involvement in the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage made her the leading Brazilian figure of women&#x27;s rights until the end of 1931, when Brazilian women finally gained the right to vote.

Lutz&#x27;s advocacy for the rights of women did not end with the right to vote, and she continued to play a prominent role in feminist campaigns. In 1933, after obtaining her law degree from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro Faculty of Law, Lutz introduced several proposals for gender equity at the Inter-American Conference of Montevideo, Uruguay. Most notable of these proposals was her call for the Inter-American Commission of Women to focus on issues of gender equality in the workplace.

In 1935, Lutz decided to run for a seat in the National Congress of Brazil and came in second behind Cándido Pessoa. She replaced him when he died a year later, making Lutz one of the few Brazilian Congresswomen of the era. The first initiative that Lutz presented while in Congress was the creation of the “Statute of Women”, a committee to analyze every Brazilian law and statute to ensure none violated the rights of women. 

Lutz, however, was unable to push forward her measures after Getúlio Vargas was reinstated as dictator in 1937, which led to a suspension of parliament, and the Statute project. Lutz nonetheless continued her diplomatic career. She was one of the four women to sign the United Nations Charter at the Inter-American Conference of Women held in San Francisco in 1945. She also served as vice president of the Inter-American Commission of Women from 1953 to 1959.

=== Political conferences ===
At the 1922 Pan-American Conference of Women, Lutz advocated for the equality of rights and opportunity of women, with a special focus on political inclusion.

Lutz came prepared to the 1933 Inter-American Conference of Montevideo with a study of the legal status of women in the Americas, and advocated that the nationality of married women should not be contingent on that of their husbands. She also proposed an Equals Rights Treaty and pushed the Inter-American Commission of Women to refocus and recommit to analyzing working conditions of women in the Americas.
During the 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, Lutz, along with Minerva Bernardino, fought for the inclusion of the word “women” in the preamble to the United Nations Charter. The first draft did not mention the word &quot;women&quot;, and against the wishes of US delegate Virginia Gildersleeve and some British female advisors, Lutz and other women from Latin America insisted in the final clause read: &quot; ...faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small&quot;. She further proposed the UN create a special commission whose purpose it would be to analyze the &quot;legal status of women&quot; around the world in order to better understand the inequalities they faced and be better prepared to combat them. She is credited with being the most prominent and tenacious advocate for the inclusion of women&#x27;s rights in the UN Charter, and without her work the United Nations would likely not have a mandate to protect women&#x27;s rights.

In 1964, Lutz headed the Brazilian delegation at the 14th Inter-American Commission in Montevideo. Additionally, at the 15th annual meeting of the Inter-American Commission of Women held in 1970, she proposed to hold a seminar dedicated to addressing the specific problems faced by indigenous women. Although she was a little over seventy at this stage of her life, Lutz continued to attend conferences and push for the expansion of women&#x27;s rights, including the World Conference on Women, 1975, in Mexico City.

===Scientific career===
After returning to Brazil in 1918, Lutz dedicated herself to the study of amphibians, especially poison dart frogs and frogs of the family &quot;Hylidae&quot;. In 1919, she was hired by the &quot;Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro&quot;. She later became a naturalist at the Section of Botany. Throughout her lifetime, Lutz would publish numerous scientific studies and publications, most notably “Observations on the life history of the Brazilian Frog” (1943), “A notable frog chorus in Brazil” (1946), and “New frogs from Itatiaia mountain” (1952). In 1958, she described what is now known as Lutz&#x27;s rapids frog (&quot;Paratelmatobius lutzii&quot; Lutz and Carvalho, 1958), which is named in honor of her father.

Lutz is honored in the names of two species of Brazilian lizards, &quot;Liolaemus lutzae&quot; and &quot;Phyllopezus lutzae&quot;, as well as four species of frogs, &quot;Pristimantis lutzae&quot;, &quot;Dendropsophus berthalutzae&quot;, &quot;Megaelosia lutzae&quot;, and &quot;Scinax berthae&quot;.

Bertha Lutz&#x27;s collections held at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro were destroyed in the fire that devastated most of the museum&#x27;s collections in September 2018.

<doc id="516762" wikidata="Q772919" url="?curid=516762" title="Intersystem crossing">
<text>Intersystem crossing (ISC) is an isoenergetic radiationless process involving a transition between the two electronic states with different spin multiplicity.

==Excited singlet and triplet states==
When an electron in a molecule with a singlet ground state is excited (&quot;via&quot; absorption of radiation) to a higher energy level, either an excited singlet state or an excited triplet state will form. Singlet state is a molecular electronic state such that all electron spins are paired. That is, the spin of the excited electron is still paired with the ground state electron (a pair of electrons in the same energy level must have opposite spins, per the Pauli exclusion principle). In a triplet state the excited electron is no longer paired with the ground state electron; that is, they are parallel (same spin). Since excitation to a triplet state involves an additional &quot;forbidden&quot; spin transition, it is less probable that a triplet state will form when the molecule absorbs radiation.

When a singlet state nonradiatively passes to a triplet state, or conversely a triplet transitions to a singlet, that process is known as intersystem crossing. In essence, the spin of the excited electron is reversed. The probability of this process occurring is more favorable when the vibrational levels of the two excited states overlap, since little or no energy must be gained or lost in the transition. As the spin/orbital interactions in such molecules are substantial and a change in spin is thus more favourable, intersystem crossing is most common in heavy-atom molecules (e.g. those containing iodine or bromine). This process is called &quot;spin-orbit coupling&quot;. Simply-stated, it involves coupling of the electron spin with the orbital angular momentum of non-circular orbits. In addition, the presence of paramagnetic species in solution enhances intersystem crossing.

The radiative decay from an excited triplet state back to a singlet state is known as phosphorescence. Since a transition in spin multiplicity occurs, phosphorescence is a manifestation of intersystem crossing. The time scale of intersystem crossing is on the order of 10−8 to 10−3 s, one of the slowest forms of relaxation.

== Metal complexes ==
Once a metal complex undergoes metal-to-ligand charge transfer, the system can undergo intersystem crossing, which, in conjunction with the tunability of MLCT excitation energies, produces a long-lived intermediate whose energy can be adjusted by altering the ligands used in the complex. Another species can then react with the long-lived excited state via oxidation or reduction, thereby initiating a redox pathway via tunable photoexcitation. Complexes containing high atomic number &quot;d&quot;6 metal centers, such as Ru(II) and Ir(III), are commonly used for such applications due to them favoring intersystem crossing as a result of their more intense spin-orbit coupling.&quot;&quot;

Complexes that have access to &quot;d&quot; orbitals are able to access spin multiplicities besides the singlet and triplet states, as some complexes have orbitals of similar or degenerate energies so that it is energetically favorable for electrons to be unpaired. It is possible then for a single complex to undergo multiple intersystem crossings, which is the case in light-induced excited spin-state trapping (LIESST), where, at low temperatures, a low-spin complex can be irradiated and undergo two instances of intersystem crossing. For Fe(II) complexes, the first intersystem crossing occurs from the singlet to the triplet state, which is then followed by intersystem crossing between the triplet and the quintet state. At low temperatures, the low-spin state is favored, but the quintet state is unable to relax back to the low-spin ground state due to their differences in zero-point energy and metal-ligand bond length. The reverse process is also possible for cases such as [Fe(ptz)6](BF4)2, but the singlet state is not fully regenerated, as the energy needed to excite the quintet ground state to the necessary excited state to undergo intersystem crossing to the triplet state overlaps with multiple bands corresponding to excitations of the singlet state that lead back to the quintet state.

== Applications ==

=== Fluorophores ===
Fluorescence microscopy relies upon fluorescent compounds, or fluorophores, in order to image biological systems. Since fluorescence and phosphorescence are competitive methods of relaxation, a fluorophore that undergoes intersystem crossing to the triplet excited state no longer fluoresces and instead remains in the triplet excited state, which has a relatively long lifetime, before phosphorescing and relaxing back to the singlet ground state so that it may continue to undergo repeated excitation and fluorescence. This process in which fluorophores temporarily do not fluoresce is called blinking. While in the triplet excited state, the fluorophore may undergo photobleaching, a process in which the fluorophore reacts with another species in the system, which can lead to the loss of the fluorescent characteristic of the fluorophore.

In order to regulate these processes dependent upon the triplet state, the rate of intersystem crossing can be adjusted to either favor or disfavor formation of the triplet state. Fluorescent biomarkers, including both quantum dots and fluorescent proteins, are often optimized in order to maximize quantum yield and intensity of fluorescent signal, which in part is accomplished by decreasing the rate of intersystem crossing. Methods of adjusting the rate of intersystem crossing include the addition of Mn2+ to the system, which increases the rate of intersystem crossing for rhodamine and cyanine dyes. The changing of the metal that is a part of the photosensitizer groups bound to CdTe quantum dots can also affect rate of intersystem crossing, as the use of a heavier metal can cause intersystem crossing to be favored due to the heavy atom effect.

=== Solar cells ===
The viability of organometallic polymers in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells has been investigated due to their donor capability. The efficiency of charge separation at the donor-acceptor interface can be improved through the use of heavy metals, as their increased spin-orbit coupling promotes the formation of the triplet MLCT excited state, which could improve exciton diffusion length and reduce the probability of recombination due to the extended lifespan of the spin-forbidden excited state. By improving the efficiency of charge separation step of the bulk heterojunction solar cell mechanism, the power conversion efficiency also improves. Improved charge separation efficiency has been shown to be a result of the formation of the triplet excited state in some conjugated platinum-acetylide polymers. However, as the size of the conjugated system increases, the increased conjugation reduces the impact of the heavy atom effect and instead makes the polymer more efficient due to the increased conjugation reducing the bandgap.

== History ==
In 1933, Aleksander Jabłoński published his conclusion that the extended lifetime of phosphorescence was due to a metastable excited state at an energy lower than the state first achieved upon excitation. Based upon this research, Gilbert Lewis and coworkers, during their investigation of organic molecule luminescence in the 1940s, concluded that this metastable energy state corresponded to the triplet electron configuration. The triplet state was confirmed by Lewis via application of a magnetic field to the excited phosphor, as only the metastable state would have a long enough lifetime to be analyzed and the phosphor would have only responded if it was paramagnetic due to it having at least one unpaired electron. Their proposed pathway of phosphorescence included the forbidden spin transition occurring when the potential energy curves of the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state crossed, from which the term intersystem crossing arose.

<doc id="516772" wikidata="Q5192125" url="?curid=516772" title="Cuban sandwich">
<text>A Cuban sandwich () is a variation of a ham and cheese sandwich that likely originated in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Tampa or Key West, two early Cuban immigrant communities in Florida centered on the cigar industry. Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami, where it is also very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, mojo, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread. Salami is included in Tampa, but is not usually included in South Florida.

The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running friendly rivalry between Miami and Tampa. As part of that rivalry, the &quot;Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich&quot; was designated the &quot;signature sandwich of the city of Tampa&quot; by the Tampa City Council in 2012.

==History==
As with Cuban bread, the origin of the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a &quot;Cuban mix,&quot; a &quot;&quot;mixto&quot;,&quot; a &quot;Cuban pressed sandwich,&quot; or a &quot;Cubano&quot;) is murky. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, travel between Cuba and Florida was easy, especially from Key West and Tampa, and Cubans frequently sailed back and forth for employment, pleasure, and family visits. Because of this constant and largely undocumented movement of people, culture and ideas, it is impossible to say exactly when or where the Cuban sandwich originated.

Some believe that the sandwich was a common lunch food for workers in both the cigar factories and sugar mills of Cuba (especially in big cities such as Havana or Santiago de Cuba) and the cigar factories of Key West by the 1860s. Historian Loy Glenn Westfall states that the sandwich was &quot;born in Cuba and educated in Key West.&quot;

The cigar industry in Florida shifted to Tampa in the mid-1880s, when the immigrant community of Ybor City was founded by cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor. Tens of thousands of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian workers moved to the area over following decades, jumpstarting the growth of Tampa from a village to a bustling city. The first recorded mentions of a distinct Cuban sandwich survive in descriptions of workers&#x27; cafés in Ybor City and nearby West Tampa from around 1900, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there. A travel article published by the &quot;Mason City Globe Gazette&quot; in 1934 said that Tampa&#x27;s cooking was &quot;much more distinctive than elsewhere in the state&quot; and lists Cuban sandwiches (along with Cuban bread) among the city&#x27;s &quot;signature foods&quot;. Researcher Andrew Huse states that &quot;the old &#x27;mixtos&#x27; coalesced into something more distinctthe Cuban sandwiches we know and lovean original Tampa creation.&quot;

By the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami cafeteria and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after Fidel Castro&#x27;s 1959 rise to power in their native land. The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them. Cuban sandwiches and variations thereof are now served in various Cuban exile communities in places such as New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, among others.

==Ingredients==
Although there is some debate as to the contents of a &quot;true&quot; Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8–12 inches (20–30 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread and the meats are added in layers: roast pork (Pernil or sometimes marinated in mojo), glazed ham, and salami. Swiss cheese and thinly sliced dill pickles complete the traditional ingredients.

Once assembled, a Cuban sandwich can be toasted in a sandwich press called a &quot;plancha&quot;, which is similar to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The &quot;plancha&quot; both heats and compresses the sandwich, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the cheese has begun to melt. It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving.

===Regional variations===
The main regional disagreement regarding the Cuban sandwich involves salami, and its inclusion or lack thereof is a major point of contention in the Tampa-Miami Cuban sandwich rivalry. While salami is not added to a South Florida Cuban sandwich, in Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived side by side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City at the beginning of the 20th century. Tampa&#x27;s recipe has been consistent for decades; a 1934 travel article described a Tampa Cuban sandwich as a &quot;complete meal&quot; consisting of ham, lean pork, Swiss cheese, soft salami, dill pickle and a &quot;liberal moistening of mustard&quot; served on &quot;very crisp and crusty&quot; Cuban bread. These ingredients were reiterated twenty-seven years later in the first and all subsequent editions of &quot;The Gasparilla Cookbook&quot; (1961), a still-popular collection of Tampa cuisine.

Another regional variation involves mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato. These additions are frowned upon by most traditionalists in Tampa and Miami, but are usually included in the &quot;Cuban mix&quot; variant popular in Key West.

The Florida-based grocery chain Publix sells both ready-made Cuban sandwiches to go and hot pressed Cuban sandwiches made to order in their delis. The Publix deli recipe uses Boar’s Head brand ham and pork unless otherwise specified along with French bread rather than traditional Cuban bread. This Cuban variation is consistently one of Publix’s bestselling sandwiches in its Florida stores.

==Cultural connections==
===Tampa–Miami rivalry===
The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running semi-serious rivalry between Tampa and Miami, with various community leaders claiming to be home of the best. The debate has been covered by several national and international news outlets, and a related content dispute on the English Wikipedia article about the sandwich was the subject of a 2007 column in the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot;.

During a 2012 flare-up of the debate, the Tampa City Council voted to name the &quot;Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich&quot; as the city&#x27;s official &quot;signature sandwich&quot;, leading to several more rounds of banter between public figures in Tampa and Miami.

===Other connections===
* In May 2012, Victor Padilla and Jolie Gonzalez-Padilla organized the first Cuban Sandwich Festival, which was held in Tampa and included the building of the &quot;World&#x27;s Longest Cuban Sandwich&quot; and a competition for the best Cuban sandwich among local and statewide restaurants. The festival has been held annually since, and the competition has grown to include entrants from across Florida, the US, and other countries competing in several categories. The organizers have also held smaller festivals with preliminary sandwich competitions in Miami and Kissimmee, Florida.
* In the 2014 film &quot;Chef&quot; starring Jon Favreau, the main character drives across the United States selling Cuban sandwiches (referred to as &quot;Cubanos&quot;) from a food truck called &quot;El Jefe&quot;.
* In 2016, Christopher Spata, a writer for the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, sent press releases to a variety of news organizations and online holiday databases touting August 23 as &quot;National Cuban Sandwich Day&quot; to see how easy it was to create a &quot;made-up food holiday&quot;. Several news sources and websites added the date to their list of holidays, and the event has been celebrated and promoted in a growing number of online and real-world locations in the following years. Spata&#x27;s story about his experiment appeared on the front page of the &quot;tbt*&quot; tabloid newspaper in Tampa and was picked up by national news outlets.

==Related dishes==

A similar sandwich is the medianoche (&quot;midnight&quot;) sandwich; as the name suggests, the sandwich originated as a late-night snack, likely in the night clubs of Havana. The medianoche contains the same ingredients as the Cuban sandwich, but is smaller and, unlike a Cuban, is served on yellow-colored egg bread (similar to challah), which is softer and sweeter than Cuban bread.

This dish and its origin are also mentioned in:
