<text>Air America (formerly Air America Radio and Air America Media) was an American radio network specializing in progressive talk radio. It was on the air from March 2004 to January 2010.

The network was founded as a left–wing alternative to counter talk radio with a right–wing perspective. Air America featured programs with monologues by on-air personalities, guest interviews, call-ins from listeners, and news reports. Several shows had million plus audiences, and multiple weekday presenters continued on in radio, television, or politics after their time on Air America. For example, in 2008, &quot;The Thom Hartmann Program&quot; had 1.5–2 million unique listeners a week and &quot;The Lionel Show&quot; had 1.5–1.75 million unique listeners a week. Hartmann, Randi Rhodes, and Mike Malloy later had shows on other radio networks. Marc Maron started his &quot;WTF podcast&quot; by trespassing in Air America&#x27;s studios after the network&#x27;s demise, before moving to Los Angeles. Al Franken went from his show to the United States Senate, and Rachel Maddow moved her show to television on MSNBC.

The network was financially troubled, however. A scandal involving nearly $1 million in loans from a Boys &amp; Girls Club in New York secretly transacted by Evan Cohen came out in 2005 and was a source of negative publicity. The loans were repaid, but in October 2006, mounting debts forced Air America Radio to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company was bought by New York real estate investor Stephen L. Green and his brother Mark Green, who purchased the network in March 2007 for US$4.25 million.

The company eventually changed its name from Air America Radio to Air America Media and lastly to just Air America, an effort to establish itself as a broadcaster on multiple media sources including television and the Internet, and one not merely relegated to radio. Always primarily a radio network, on January 21, 2010, Air America went off the air citing difficulties with the current economic environment. It filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidated itself. Bennett Zier was the company&#x27;s last CEO including through the bankruptcy and liquidation.

Sometime after the network&#x27;s closure, Newsweb Corporation (owned by Chicago entrepreneur, political activist, and philanthropist Fred Eychaner, owner of Chicago&#x27;s WCPT progressive talk radio station) acquired ownership of the branding.

==Programming overview==

Air America Media&#x27;s progressive talk radio programming consisted of news, talk, comedy, interviews, guest editorials, and listeners&#x27; telephone calls. The talk portions featured some extended host monologues in the classic talk radio format. Live and pre-recorded comedy routines, featuring various comedians, were also aired. As with most syndicated broadcast networks, local affiliate stations were able to air select programs or the entire schedule, subject to contractual arrangements.

===Format===
The shows followed a half-hour format from six minutes past the hour to 28 minutes after the hour followed by a &quot;hard break&quot; for six minutes until 34 minutes past the hour. The final hard break occurs at 58 minutes past the hour, leading into the news at the top of the hour. There was also a floating break in both the first and second half-hours. Local stations could run their own commercials, local news and weather or other features during the breaks.

===News===
Air America featured its own news summary breaks at the top of each hour, with content from wire services such as the Associated Press (AP) and United Press International (UPI). Some affiliates used other news services or would run their own newscasts during the six-minute &quot;news hole&quot; at the top of the hour. AAR later switched to AP Radio Network News, and finally Free Speech Radio News. These newscasts ended on June 29, 2007, with local stations signing up with other radio news networks.

===Public affairs and editorials===
The public affairs programs tended to closely follow current happenings in the news, with monologues and reflections offered by the hosts and their guests. Listener comments by phone or the Internet were worked into these segments along with the interviews.

===Music===
Although better known for its political shows, Air America also featured a couple of music oriented shows on weekends. &quot;On the Real&quot; featuring Chuck D had a strong music focus. &quot;The Steve Earle Show&quot; (which ended in 2007 with Earle moving to Sirius Satellite Radio) mixed music with political commentary. Dr. Demento was a guest host on the network at least once. Also, most of the talk shows had their own theme songs, used bumper music to segue between commercials and segments, and played political novelty songs. Theme songs and bumper music were generally commercially released rock music.

===Weekday programs===
Air America produced sixteen hours of weekday network programming. The entire schedule was carried on the network&#x27;s internet stream, and affiliates may have carried some, most or all shows.

The network&#x27;s schedule as of Mid-2009:
&lt;br&gt;
*A one-hour webcast, &quot;Breakroom Live with Maron &amp; Seder&quot;, aired weekdays from 3-4PM Eastern. Marc Maron and Sam Seder hosted the show from the actual break room at Air America Media in New York. Breakroom Live aired its last show on July 15, 2009.

===Syndication===
On September 8, 2005, Air America Radio formed a separate syndication division, designed to offer additional programming and services to both progressive talk and other talk/music formats. Air America Syndication was used to syndicate Thom Hartmann, and later &quot;Springer on the Radio&quot; which aired at the same time as The Al Franken Show and The Sam Seder Show respectively on the regular network lineup. Springer ended his show on December 5, 2006, and Franken&#x27;s ended on February 14, 2007. On January 29, 2007, Air America announced that Hartmann would replace Franken on the regular network lineup. When Air America entered bankruptcy, there were no programs syndicated as a part of Air America Syndication.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In late 2002 Chicago entrepreneurs Sheldon Drobny and Anita Drobny, angered at the firing of their favorite radio host, Mike Malloy, decided to try to get Malloy syndicated nationally. At Mike&#x27;s behest they called Atlanta-based radio executive Jon Sinton and requested a national berth for Malloy. The Drobnys hired Sinton as CEO of AnShell Media, and the three went about raising money. The first official fundraiser was in October 2002 at the home of Arianna Huffington. The gathering was enthusiastically attended by many Hollywood notables. Sinton&#x27;s brother, broadcaster Carey Bruce Sinton, suggested calling the venture Central Air, a name that stuck until just before launch.

Around this same time, Democratic political operative Tom Athans and radio industry veteran Paul Fiddick launched Democracy Radio in Washington, D.C. Democracy Radio was an organization founded in September 2002 dedicated to creating political balance on America&#x27;s commercial radio airwaves. Its concept was to develop, fund and incubate progressive oriented talk programming and retain well established radio networks to market the programs to stations around the country. Democracy Radio developed and produced talk shows that launched the national careers of Ed Schultz and Stephanie Miller.

AnShell announced its intentions publicly in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article in February 2003 in which writer Jim Rutenburg interviewed Jon Sinton about the need for a balanced national discussion. Sinton, the Drobnys and their associate, Javier Saade, a Harvard Business School grad and venture capitalist, continued to raise awareness but little money throughout 2003 by spending time in New York, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Sinton met repeatedly with Al Franken to convince him to become the network&#x27;s anchor talent. Franken did not commit to the enterprise, as he was worried about its sustainability.

After mentioning actress and activist Janeane Garofalo during an appearance on Judy Woodruff&#x27;s &quot;Politics Today&quot; show on CNN, Sinton received a call from Garofalo stating her interest in hosting a show. On a fundraising trip to Los Angeles, Sinton, at the suggestion of Al Franken, met with &quot;Daily Show&quot; co-creator Lizz Winstead, and she would later co-host one of the original shows and be the first program manager.

In November 2003, Sinton&#x27;s brother Steve Sinton left Clear Channel&#x27;s talk radio division to join AAR as vice president of programming and operations.

Meanwhile, none of these talent agreements were finalized, as fundraising was difficult. The reputation of the effort was coming under duress and scrutiny, as it was announced but not taking shape. A further complication was that AnShell found itself competing against Democracy Radio for investors. During a trip to Washington, D.C., former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta suggested a young lawyer, David Goodfriend, who introduced the Drobnys and Sinton to his former college roommate, Evan Montvel Cohen, who had profited from advertising and research companies in the Pacific Rim. Having taken the idea as far as they could, the principals sold AnShell Media to Cohen and his partner, Rex Sorensen, a broadcaster from Guam, US, who formed Progress Media, with Cohen as chairman, and Mark Walsh as CEO; Sinton&#x27;s title remained as president, but his impact on day-to-day operations was reduced after the sale to Cohen

===Launch and rapid growth===
From the hiring of Goodfriend and Walsh in the fall of 2003, the network began to take shape. Al Franken and Garafalo finally agreed to contracts, and in short order the company was able reach agreement and hire Winstead, Chuck D, comedian Marc Maron, media attorney Carl Ginsberg, and many more people. In early 2004, talent, engineers and producers were hired, a lease was signed with New York&#x27;s WLIB creating a New York home and affiliate, and, at noon Eastern time on March 31, the newly renamed Air America Radio Network was launched.

Air America Radio was then the only all-progressive talk radio network. A predecessor, the UAW&#x27;s I.E. America Radio Network, which was home to hosts such as Thom Hartmann, Peter Werbe, and Mike Malloy, never gained national attention. Its last day on the air was February 27, 2004, only weeks before Air America took to the airwaves. Although not a network, Democracy Radio launched The Ed Schultz Show three months prior to the launch of Air America in January 2004. The Stephanie Miller Show followed September 2004.

Franken&#x27;s show was the centerpiece of Air America, and would remain so for a little less than 3 years. The show featured Franken&#x27;s low-key humor, political commentary, and guest and audience participation. Randi Rhodes was also in the initial lineup.
AAR became the fastest growing network in modern radio history, increasing its listeners from 120,000 to 400,000 within three months, and reaching 2.137 million listeners per week in 2005.

===Difficulties and turnover===
At the time it started Air America Radio, &quot;Progress Media&quot;, (an entity created and completely controlled by Evan Cohen and his former business partner, Rex Sorenson) stated it had secured US$30 million in venture capital before its debut. The amount was later estimated by the Wall Street Journal to be closer to US$6 million; Sorensen said that an investor had backed out at the last minute.

Sorensen never identified who the supposed investor was. Sorensen served as the chief financial officer of both Progress Media, and Air America Radio. He had complete control over all funds and banking relationships for the company, and reported directly to the chairman, Evan Cohen. No one else at the company, from Walsh on down, had any control of or input to Sorensen&#x27;s activities.

On April 2, 2004, the day after launching the network, CEO Mark Walsh departed the offices for good. He had been having a number of disagreements with Evan Cohen about the direction of the company, and in particular about the complete lack of financial transparency in Cohen&#x27;s business dealings and fundraising efforts. Walsh was a resident of Washington, D.C., and told Cohen that he could not be part of an enterprise run in such an opaque and disruptive fashion. Walsh never returned to the offices while Cohen was chairman, and resigned from the company several weeks later.

Two weeks after the on-air debut of Air America Radio, programming was withdrawn in two key markets due to contract disputes. Multicultural Radio owned two stations contracted to carry Air America programming, in Chicago and Santa Monica, California. Air America alleged that Multicultural Radio had sold time on its Los Angeles station to both Air America and another party, and said that that was why it stopped payment on checks due to Multicultural while Air America investigated. Multicultural Radio argued that Air America had bounced a check and claimed it was owed in excess of US$1 million. Air America Radio filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, charging breach of contract and was briefly granted an injunction to restore the network on WNTD in Chicago. On April 20, 2004, the network announced the dispute had been settled, and Air America&#x27;s last day of broadcast on WNTD was April 30, 2004. The New York Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the injunction was improvidently entered and that Air America Radio&#x27;s court action was without merit, dismissing Air America&#x27;s complaint and awarding over US$250,000 in damages and attorneys&#x27; fees to Multicultural. According to a subsequent lawsuit filed by Multicultural, Air America Radio never paid the sums ordered by the court.

Four weeks after Air America&#x27;s debut, its executive vice president for programming, Dave Logan, left the network. One week after those departures, its chairman and vice chairman, Evan Cohen and his investment partner Rex Sorensen, were forced out by the remaining investors. In a tense late night meeting, which included Franken, Saade, the Drobnys, Mark Walsh and other investors, the company found out that it had virtually no assets. It asked David Goodfriend to operate the company while a reorganization was planned and new funds were raised. Subsequently, the company had a number of acting CEO&#x27;s, including outside investor Doug Kreeger and Jon Sinton for a short period.

The tumultuous early days of the network were chronicled in a fly-on-the-wall HBO documentary, &quot;Left of the Dial&quot;.

As part of a reorganization, the Progress Media board of directors bought the assets of that company, creating a new company, Piquant LLC; at around the same time, the company decided to stop trying to buy radio stations and lease air time, and to allow affiliates to carry programming outside of the network&#x27;s offerings.

On February 28, 2005, a new CEO, Danny Goldberg, was named, and in April 2005, Gary Krantz was named president of the network. Ginsburg and Sinton were named co-COOs with Ginsburg in charge of operations and Sinton running programming and affiliate relations.

In December 2005, over Sinton&#x27;s objections, CEO Danny Goldberg broke up the network&#x27;s morning drive-time show &quot;Morning Sedition&quot;, and let comedian and co-host Marc Maron&#x27;s contract lapse. While the increased overhead for the show&#x27;s heavily produced format may have been a factor in the show&#x27;s demise, Maron claimed that Goldberg did not &quot;get&quot; or agree with the comedy on the show. Maron exacerbated the conflict by calling attention to his situation during the show for several weeks, prompting a petition drive that garnered over 5,000 signatures. This was to no avail, as Maron announced on November 28 that his last show would be December 16, 2005. Maron was offered an evening show, which ran briefly on affiliate KTLK in Los Angeles, but Air America never followed through with promised national syndication and the show was cancelled in July 2006. Goldberg announced his resignation on April 6, 2006, after a little more than a year on the job. Maron guest hosted a few times in 2007, and later co-hosted a webcast program for Air America called &quot;Breakroom Live&quot;.

Janeane Garofalo&#x27;s last day as co-host of &quot;The Majority Report&quot; was on July 14, 2006. Several reasons for her departure were cited (including her outside acting responsibilities). The show ended a few months later.

By the late summer of 2006 Sinton and Ginsburg&#x27;s influence was marginalized (both would leave in short order).

On August 30, 2006, nighttime host Mike Malloy was fired from the network. Malloy had hosted a nighttime show from the inception of the network. The show was vitriolic in its criticism of the right–wing. Comments included referring to the Bushes as the &quot;Bush crime family&quot;; right–wingers commonly were referred to as &quot;rat bastards&quot; and &quot;pigs&quot;. In the two weeks before the firing, Malloy had announced an impending multi-year deal for him to stay with Air America (and to return on the air in New York City). The firing was explained as for financial reasons. Rumours persist that Malloy&#x27;s criticism of Israel during its bombardment of Lebanon in the summer of 2006 may have played a role. News of his termination was conveyed via a short statement on the homepage of Malloy&#x27;s website, posted by his wife/producer Kathy Bay Malloy. His final show was on August 29, 2006, filling in for Randi Rhodes. No mention of his firing was made during the broadcast. Malloy&#x27;s firing drew criticism from Air America on-air talent, including Rhodes and Sam Seder. It also began a large online campaign, including a petition that had over 17,000 signatures as of October 2006. At the end of October, Malloy resumed his show on a newly created progressive radio network, Nova M Radio.

===Gloria Wise controversy===

In July 2005, the &quot;Bronx News&quot; reported that the Gloria Wise Boys and Girls Club of Co-op City, a non-profit organization providing services for children and seniors in the Bronx, loaned (equivalent to $ in ) to Progress Media, then owner of Air America Radio. It later turned out that there had been four separate transfers from Gloria Wise between October 2, 2003, and March 14, 2004, totalling (equivalent to $ in ), and that no interest was to be paid on these loans.

Since then, the city has suspended further funding of the agency, and Boys and Girls Clubs of America has revoked the group&#x27;s right to use their name, likeness or logo. At the time the funds were to have been transferred, Evan Cohen, the founder and first chairman of Air America and the former chairman of the now-defunct Progress Media, was also director of development for Gloria Wise.

In response to this report, Air America Radio&#x27;s owners at the time, Piquant LLC, issued a press release stating Piquant had &quot;no obligation to Progress Media&#x27;s business activities&quot;, and Piquant, as previously agreed, would &quot;fully compensate&quot; the Gloria Wise Boys &amp; Girls Club. While Gloria Wise remains under investigation, Air America has since repaid the loan. On May 28, 2008, Cohen was arrested at Guam International Airport on a warrant from the State of Hawaii. He was indicted in Hawaii for money laundering and stealing over (equivalent to $ in ) from a Honolulu-based landscaping company.

===&quot;Air America, The Playbook&quot;===
&quot;Air America, the Playbook&quot;, a 300 plus page collection of essays, transcripts, and interviews by mostly Air America personalities was published shortly before the 2006 Congressional elections. It was on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for October 8, 2006.

===Reorganizational bankruptcy and sale to Green Family Media===
A week later, on October 13, 2006, Air America filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Air America continued broadcasting while the finances were worked out with the creditors. The company had US$4,331,265.30 in assets and US$20,266,056.23 in liabilities. Al Franken alone was owed US$360,749.98 and Rob Glaser, founder of RealNetworks, was owed the most at US$9.8 million. The filing had over 25 pages of creditors and showed that the company lost US$9.1 million in 2004, US$19.6 million in 2005 and an additional US$13.1 million by mid-October in 2006.

On January 29, 2007, Air America &quot;signed a letter of intent to sell its business to SLG Radio LLC, an entity controlled by Stephen L. Green, the founder and chairman of SL Green Realty Corp, a company that controls 27 million ft2 (2.5 million m2) of real estate with a market capitalization of US$12 billion&quot;. Air America CEO Scott Elberg said of Air America&#x27;s sale, &quot;We are extremely pleased to have reached this agreement with Mr. Green, which will solidify Air America&#x27;s future.&quot; The sale was completed on March 6, 2007, to Green Family Media, a new company created by Stephen Green and his brother Mark Green.

===Franken moves on to the U.S. Senate===

During the bankruptcy, key on-air personality Al Franken decided that he was going to give up his show of three years in order to run for U.S. Senate. He made his official announcement during the last show. Thom Hartmann replaced him in March 2007. Franken won a close and highly contested election to become the 60th Senator in the Democratic Caucus for the 111th United States Congress.

===Air America 2.0===
After the sale, major changes were quickly put into place. Stephen Green became the network&#x27;s chairman, and Mark Green became president of Air America, with a hands-on role. Former chief executive Scott Elberg remained as chief operating officer. Mark Green announced on Thursday, April 25, 2007, that Westwood One would take over the handling of Air America&#x27;s ad sales from Jones Radio Networks. In addition, a new lineup was unveiled for the radio network. The top four weekday shows were kept, but extensive changes were made to the rest of the lineup. Green also announced a redesign for the network&#x27;s website, in addition to a new logo.

On March 14, 2007, the new owners of Air America announced the hiring of longtime radio veteran David Bernstein to be the new vice president of programming. Prior to joining Air America, he was best known as the program director at New York radio station WOR from 1995 to 2002. In an interview with the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Bernstein explained his vision of Air America&#x27;s future as &quot;I don&#x27;t see our purpose as &#x27;answering&#x27; conservative radio or Rush Limbaugh. There&#x27;s no clear majority in this country today. We want to talk to everyone and help everyone make the right choice.&quot; On November 15, 2007, industry news site Radio Online reported that Bernstein was exiting Air America.

After being suspended by Air America management for derogatory remarks toward Geraldine Ferraro and Hillary Clinton while off the air, Randi Rhodes quit the network on April 9, 2008, citing a contract dispute. She was one of Air America&#x27;s more popular hosts, with a listener base of 1.5 million unique listeners per week built up over 4 years. Rhodes moved to Nova M Radio the next week, and was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks after Nova M went bankrupt.

Meanwhile, longtime host Rachel Maddow was finding her way into television. As a guest host and as a panelist, she appeared on MSNBC. She started her own show on the network in September 2008, in prime time after Keith Olbermann and Chris Matthews. Her radio show became more of a replay of her television show, and ultimately her radio program became a one-hour show in the mornings.

Maddow didn&#x27;t want to completely depart from radio. She commented &quot;My relationship with the radio audience is valuable and important. I also believe in what Air America is doing.&quot;

Thom Hartmann moved his show to the Dial Global radio network on March 1, 2009. Hartmann had been the flagship program on AAR for a year. Montel Williams hosted the new flagship program in Lionel&#x27;s previous spot, and Lionel moved his show to the 12p.m.–3p.m. ET slot.

=== Sale and closure ===
Stephen Green sold Air America Radio in 2009 to Charles Kireker. Mark Green continued as president.

On January 21, 2010, Air America announced that it would immediately cease programming and file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, giving the following explanation on their website:

The very difficult economic environment has had a significant impact on Air America&#x27;s business. This past year has seen a &quot;perfect storm&quot; in the media industry generally. National and local advertising revenues have fallen drastically, causing many media companies nationwide to fold or seek bankruptcy protection. From large to small, recent bankruptcies like Citadel Broadcasting and closures like that of the industry&#x27;s long-time trade publication Radio &amp; Records have signaled that these are very difficult and rapidly changing times.

Others involved with Air America or progressive talk radio cite other reasons as the cause of the network&#x27;s demise. Thom Hartmann left Air America due in part to his dissatisfaction with the network&#x27;s merry-go-round management. &quot;We&#x27;ve been far more successful since we left,&quot; Mr. Hartmann said in an interview after the closure. Several other former employees have made similar complaints, specifically that the management of Air America lacked the necessary broadcasting business expertise.

Progressive commentator Alan Colmes cited problems with the network&#x27;s constituent stations:

Because conservatives were so entrenched on heritage stations, the progressives on Air America were relegated to smaller, less powerful, under-performing signals that could not compete with their more established counterparts; certainly not without lots of promotion and time to develop, both of which were denied in most cases.

At some point after the network&#x27;s closure in 2010, Newsweb Corporation (the owner of Chicago&#x27;s WCPT AM band radio station) gained ownership of the network&#x27;s name.

==Ratings==
In Arbitron&#x27;s Spring 2008 ratings book, stations carrying a majority AAR programming and in markets reporting every quarter averaged a 1.3 share. The highest rated Air America affiliates were KPOJ in Portland, Oregon (3.7 share), WXXM in Madison, Wisconsin (3.5), and KABQ in Albuquerque, New Mexico (2.6). The lowest rated affiliates were WDTW and WLBY in Detroit, Michigan (unmeasurable), WOIC in Columbia, South Carolina (0.4), WTKG in Grand Rapids, Michigan (0.5), and flagship station WWRL in New York City (0.5).

WXXM in Madison had announced in November 2006 that it would switch to all sports programming by the end of the year. Following backlash from the station&#x27;s listeners and syndicated hosts, Clear Channel in Madison later backtracked, deciding to leave the progressive talk format on the station.

==Affiliates==

As of October 2008, Air America programming was carried on 66 terrestrial broadcast stations, an increase of 10 percent over the previous six months. Thirty-two of these stations broadcast a majority AAR programming. During the first 4½ years of the network&#x27;s existence, Air America has lost 63 affiliates to other programming or formats. Air America counts any station that carries any of their programming as an affiliate, similar to radio networks such as ESPN Radio. Stations owned by Clear Channel Communications had been early backers of the network, and the company used the network as programming for some of its smaller AM stations. However, in the past few years, the network has been moving instead toward replacing Air America on those stations with Fox Sports Radio (a Clear Channel product), as WCKY Cincinnati, KLSD San Diego and WINZ Miami were all once Air America affiliates but are now affiliated with Fox Sports. (There have been a few notable exceptions that have remained with Air America, such as WXXM in Madison, Wisconsin, which kept Air America after listener protests, and KKGN in San Francisco, where the Fox Sports affiliation is held by another station and there are fewer programming options due to significant competition).

SiriusXM Satellite Radio channel &quot;Sirius XM Progress&quot; currently broadcasts programs from two former Air Americans: Mike Malloy and Thom Hartmann.

<text>Filbert Street was a football stadium in Leicester, England, which served as the home of Leicester City F.C. from 1891 until 2002. Although officially titled the City Business Stadium in the early 1990s, it remained known almost exclusively by its address, like many English football stadiums.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Leicester City was formed in 1884. The club was then named &quot;Leicester Fosse&quot;, as its founders mostly lived in the west end of the city, through which the Fosse Way ran. In 1884–85 it played at a ground known as the Racecourse, before sharing Victoria Park with the Leicester Tigers rugby club for two years. Leicester Fosse played at the Belgrave Road Cycle Track for a year, but returned to Victoria Park after the rugby club offered a higher rent to the owners of the Cycle Track.

Leicester Fosse became a professional club in 1889 and laid out its own ground at Mill Lane, just north of Filbert Street. The club was soon forced to move, however, as the local Corporation requested the land for development. The site of what was to become Filbert Street was prepared during the summer of 1891, while Leicester Fosse temporarily played at the Aylestone Road Cricket Ground. Local legend suggests that the new ground was identified by a Miss Westland, the niece of one of the club&#x27;s founders, Joseph Johnson. The stadium was initially known as Walnut Street, being the closest road to the ground at the time. The first game Leicester Fosse played there was a game against Nottingham Forest&#x27;s reserve team on 7 November 1891.

The stadium initially consisted of simple earth banks and a small main stand on the west side, until 1921, when a new and much larger main stand was built. The Main Stand opened 24 November 1921. In 1927, a new stand was built at the south end (known as the Spion Kop), and became known as the &quot;Double Decker&quot; although was officially the South Stand. The roof which had previously covered the Kop was rebuilt at the north, or Filbert Street end of the ground. It was in this form that Filbert Street saw its record attendance of 47,298 for the Fifth Round FA Cup tie, a 3–0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur on 18 February 1928. This game also saw many more spectators watch the match from the roof of the Filbert Street end. Despite the defeat, the stadium saw more FA Cup action that season when it was selected as the neutral venue for the semi-final between Blackburn Rovers and Arsenal on 24 March 1928 where eventual winners Blackburn Rovers won 1–0.
The first phase of ground development concluded with the covering of the East or Popular side in 1939.

=== Second World War and after ===
The middle section of the Main Stand suffered bomb damage in 1940, and was later further damaged by a serious fire. By 1949, the stand had been rebuilt, with much of the labour being supplied by German POWs at a nearby camp. The ground&#x27;s maximum capacity was now around 42,000. Floodlights were installed and first used for a match against the German champions Borussia Dortmund on 23 October 1957.

After just surviving a council vote to terminate their lease in the late 1940s, City purchased the freehold of the ground in 1962, for the sum of £30,500. In 1971, the first moves towards an all-seater stadium were taken, as the North and East sides were converted to seating. Four years later, 20 basic executive boxes were added to the North Stand. A pioneering polythene cover was introduced to protect the pitch in 1971. The Air Dome covered an area of 90,000 square feet, weighed 24 cwt and took 15 men two hours to lay out and inflate using four electric fans. The Air Dome was removed in 1982.

=== All-seater stadium ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, after considering moving to a new stadium, and a total redevelopment of Filbert Street which would have seen the pitch rotated by 90 degrees, onto the car park behind the Main Stand, City opted to build a new Main Stand, demolishing the existing structure in the summer of 1993. It was anticipated that further modernisation work would take place in the future.

Completed in December 1993, the Carling Stand held 9,500 seated spectators and expanded corporate facilities, costing £6 million. In 1994, the final terraced area – the Kop – was converted to seating giving Filbert Street an all-seated capacity of 21,500, and bringing it into compliance with the Taylor Report which required all Premier League and Division One teams to have all-seater capacity.
===Neutral venue===
Filbert Street hosted a Football League test match on 27 April 1895 which saw Derby County beat Notts County 2–1 to remain in the First Division, with Notts County remaining in the Second Division.

It also held the finals of the FA Amateur Cup in 1896 and 1900. On 28 March 1896, Bishop Auckland beat Royal Artillery Portsmouth 1–0 and on 31 March 1900, Bishop Auckland were again the winners, beating Lowestoft Town 5–1.

Filbert was later used as a neutral venue for two FA Cup semi-finals. The first took place in 1928 between Blackburn Rovers and Arsenal and in 1962 it hosted a semi-final replay between Burnley and Fulham, following a draw at Villa Park. In the replay, Burnley progressed to the final with a 2–1 win.

It was the neutral venue of the semi-final of the 1970–71 FA Trophy between Hillingdon Borough F.C. and Hereford United, which Hillingdon won 2–0.

It also held multiple FA Cup second replays including two long running ties. In March 1975, it hosted the second replay of League champions Leeds United against Ipswich Town in the fifth round of the cup following two previous draws but the second replay also ended in a draw (0–0). Two days later, the teams met again at Filbert Street with Ipswich Town finally winning 3–2 to progress to the semi-final against eventual winners West Ham United. In 1979, Filbert Street again hosted a marathon tie, this time between Arsenal and Sheffield Wednesday in the third round. Again, following two draws between the teams, Filbert Street hosted the second replay on 15 January 1979 but this ended in a 2–2 draw. Two days later the teams met again at Filbert Street but again, the teams could not be separated, drawing 3–3. Finally, in the fifth game between the teams held the following week, Arsenal progressed to the next round, winning 2–0. It was the last time the stadium had an attendance over 30,000 (30,275). Despite the struggle to progress from the third round, Arsenal went on to win the competition.

Filbert Street also held one Football League Cup second replay between Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and Oldham Athletic on 20 September 1977, which Oldham won 2–1 after extra time.

It hosted a third round League Cup tie between Luton Town and Coventry City on 27 October 1987 as Luton were banned from using their plastic pitch in the competition. Luton won 3–1.

England under-23s played West Germany&#x27;s under-23s at the stadium on 14 October 1970, which England won 3–1. England&#x27;s under-21 team played their final qualifying game of the 1980 UEFA U-21 Football Championship and beat Bulgaria to progress to the finals. It was also used for England under-21s games against Portugal in 1994 and Mexico in 2001. 

Filbert Street hosted one full international game between India and Bangladesh on 29 July 2000, with India winning 1–0.

=== Move and demolition ===

There had been plans in 1977 to move to a new stadium to be built in Beaumont Leys. The residents of Anstey and other nearby districts voiced their concerns of a new stadium being built nearby and the plan was stopped and £1 million was spent improving Filbert Street and adding more seats instead.

Following the success of the club under Martin O&#x27;Neill during the later part of the 1990s, an expanded stadium was required for higher attendances and to provide better facilities. Expansion of Filbert Street would have been very difficult, as the North and East Stands backed onto housing which would have been expensive to place under a compulsory purchase order. Although expansion was considered, by 1998 the decision had been taken to move to a completely new stadium. After a failed attempt to build a 40,000 all-seater stadium at Bede Island South (on the other bank of the nearby River Soar), the club purchased Freeman&#x27;s Wharf, a former power station site 200 yards south of Filbert Street. Work began on a 32,500 seater stadium during 2001 and it was opened in July 2002.

Filbert Street was sold to a development company for £3.75 million in March 2002, two months before the last game was played there. The last game to be played at Filbert Street was the last game of the 2001–02 season, a 2–1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur – one of just five league games that Leicester won during that season, culminating in relegation to Division One. Matt Piper scored the last goal scored at the ground, bringing to an end 111 years of football there. In the autumn of 2002, Rotherham United expressed interest in purchasing the Carling Stand and moving it to their Millmoor stadium, but these plans were soon abandoned and the decade-old stand would soon be demolished along with the rest of Filbert Street.

Demolition of Filbert Street was begun in March 2003. Part of the site is now home to the &#x27;Filbert Village&#x27; development, built as accommodation for students for the nearby De Montfort University and University of Leicester. The road running through the development is called Lineker Road after one of Leicester City&#x27;s most famous players, Gary Lineker. The rest of the site was meant to be developed for housing, but this work was cancelled due to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It was then leased to a car parking company, but this arrangement was terminated by Leicester City Council in March 2012.

<text>Gordon Leslie Arnold (August 14, 1941 – October 15, 1997) was a Canadian-American man who claimed to have witnessed the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.

Arnold did not become known as an eyewitness to the assassination until 1978, when on August 27 of that year, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; published an article by Earl Golz alleging that several &quot;counterfeit&quot; agents of the United States Secret Service were in Dealey Plaza shortly before and after the assassination. The following day, the story was reported by the Associated Press and United Press International. Arnold would later be interviewed on his alleged experience for &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot;. Witness to the assassination Senator Ralph Yarborough told Golz that &quot;Immediately on the firing of the first shot I saw the man you interviewed throw himself on the ground...He was down within a second of the time the shot was fired and I thought to myself, ‘There’s a combat veteran who knows how to act when weapons start firing.

According to the report, Arnold and at least four other individuals said they met men who identified themselves as Secret Service agents. Arnold stated that he was attempting to move to the railroad bridge above the triple underpass to film the presidential limousine and motorcade when a man with a badge who said he was with the Secret Service told him that he could not be there. According to Arnold in that interview, he moved to a dirt mound in front of the picket fence on the &quot;grassy knoll&quot; where he filmed the motorcade as it moved down Elm Street. He described at least one shot as being fired past his left ear from behind, stating that he &quot;hit the dirt&quot; after feeling the first just over his left shoulder, and that while lying down his impression was that at least one more shot came from that location, although he said he heard the echoes of gunfire through the Plaza which made it difficult to determine the source of the other shot(s) with certainty. Arnold indicated that he remained lying down for the duration of the shooting until he was confronted by two policemen who confiscated his film and ordered him to leave the area. Arnold would give more information in &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot; interview, where he mentioned that the film was confiscated by a man wearing a policeman&#x27;s uniform, except he was not wearing a hat. Arnold suggested that he had been afraid to report the incident due to claims of &quot;peculiar&quot; deaths of witnesses to the assassination.

According to the report, at the time of the assassination Arnold was a soldier who had just completed basic training and was reporting for duty in Fort Wainwright, Alaska two days later. In 1978, he was an investigator with the Dallas Department of Consumer Affairs. Arnold rose to the rank of Specialist 5 in the United States Army.

<text>Gnome sort (nicknamed stupid sort) is a variation of the insertion sort sorting algorithm that does not use nested loops. Gnome sort was originally proposed by Iranian computer scientist Hamid Sarbazi-Azad (professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Sharif University of Technology) in 2000. The sort was first called &quot;stupid sort&quot; (not to be confused with bogosort), and then later described by Dick Grune and named &quot;gnome sort&quot;. 

Gnome sort performs at least as many comparisons as insertion sort and has the same asymptotic run time characteristics. Gnome sort works by building a sorted list one element at a time, getting each item to the proper place in a series of swaps. The average running time is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;2) but tends towards &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) if the list is initially almost sorted.

Dick Grune described the sorting method with the following story:

== Pseudocode ==
Here is pseudocode for the gnome sort using a zero-based array:

 procedure gnomeSort(a[]):
 pos := 0
 while pos &lt; length(a):
 if (pos == 0 or a[pos] &gt;= a[pos-1]):
 pos := pos + 1
 else:
 swap a[pos] and a[pos-1]
 pos := pos - 1

===Example===
Given an unsorted array, a = [5, 3, 2, 4], the gnome sort takes the following steps during the while loop. The current position is highlighted in bold and indicated as a value of the variable codice_1.

<doc id="522130" wikidata="Q899488" url="?curid=522130" title="Protonation">
<text>In chemistry, protonation (or hydronation) is the adding of a proton (or hydron, or hydrogen cation), usually denoted by H+, to an atom, molecule, or ion, forming a conjugate acid. (The complementary process, when a proton is removed from a Brønsted–Lowry acid, is deprotonation.) Some examples include
*The protonation of water by sulfuric acid:
*:H2SO4 + H2O H3O+ + 
*The protonation of isobutene in the formation of a carbocation:
*:(CH3)2C=CH2 + HBF4 (CH3)3C+ + 
*The protonation of ammonia in the formation of ammonium chloride from ammonia and hydrogen chloride:
*:NH3(g) + HCl(g) → NH4Cl(s)

Protonation is a fundamental chemical reaction and is a step in many stoichiometric and catalytic processes. Some ions and molecules can undergo more than one protonation and are labeled polybasic, which is true of many biological macromolecules. Protonation and deprotonation (removal of a proton) occur in most acid–base reactions; they are the core of most acid–base reaction theories. A Brønsted–Lowry acid is defined as a chemical substance that protonates another substance. Upon protonating a substrate, the mass and the charge of the species each increase by one unit, making it an essential step in certain analytical procedures such as electrospray mass spectrometry. Protonating or deprotonating a molecule or ion can change many other chemical properties, not just the charge and mass, for example solubility, hydrophilicity, reduction potential or oxidation potential, and optical properties can change.

==Rates==
Protonations are often rapid, partly because of the high mobility of protons in many solvents. The rate of protonation is related to the acidity of the protonating species: protonation by weak acids is slower than protonation of the same base by strong acids. The rates of protonation and deprotonation can be especially slow when protonation induces significant structural changes.

Enantioselective protonations are under kinetic control, are of considerable interest in organic synthesis. They are also relevant to various biological processes.

==Reversibility and catalysis==
Protonation is usually reversible, and the structure and bonding of the conjugate base are normally unchanged on protonation. In some cases, however, protonation induces isomerization, for example &quot;cis&quot;-alkenes can be converted to &quot;trans&quot;-alkenes using a catalytic amount of protonating agent. Many enzymes, such as the serine hydrolases, operate by mechanisms that involve reversible protonation of substrates.

<doc id="522147" wikidata="Q1322644" url="?curid=522147" title="Heegner number">
<text>In number theory, a Heegner number (as termed by Conway and Guy) is a square-free positive integer &quot;d&quot; such that the imaginary quadratic field formula_1 has class number 1. Equivalently, the ring of algebraic integers of formula_1 has unique factorization.

The determination of such numbers is a special case of the class number problem, and they underlie several striking results in number theory.

According to the (Baker–)Stark–Heegner theorem there are precisely nine Heegner numbers:

This result was conjectured by Gauss and proved up to minor flaws by Kurt Heegner in 1952. Alan Baker and Harold Stark independently proved the result in 1966, and Stark further indicated that the gap in Heegner&#x27;s proof was minor.

==Euler&#x27;s prime-generating polynomial==
Euler&#x27;s prime-generating polynomial
formula_3
which gives (distinct) primes for &quot;n&quot; = 0, ..., 39, is related to the Heegner number 163 = 4 · 41 − 1.

Rabinowitz proved that
formula_4
gives primes for formula_5 if and only if this quadratic&#x27;s discriminant formula_6 is the negative of a Heegner number.

(Note that formula_7 yields formula_8, so formula_9 is maximal.)

1, 2, and 3 are not of the required form, so the Heegner numbers that work are 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163, yielding prime generating functions of Euler&#x27;s form for 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, 41; these latter numbers are called &quot;lucky numbers of Euler&quot; by F. Le Lionnais.

==Almost integers and Ramanujan&#x27;s constant==
Ramanujan&#x27;s constant is the transcendental number
formula_10, which is an &quot;almost integer&quot;:
formula_11

This number was discovered in 1859 by the mathematician Charles Hermite.
In a 1975 April Fool article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine, &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; columnist Martin Gardner made the hoax claim that the number was in fact an integer, and that the Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan had predicted it – hence its name. In this wise it has as a spurious provenance as the Feynman point.

This coincidence is explained by complex multiplication and the &quot;q&quot;-expansion of the j-invariant.

===Detail===
In what follows, j(z) denotes the j-invariant of the complex number z. Briefly, formula_12 is an integer for &quot;d&quot; a Heegner number, and
formula_13
via the &quot;q&quot;-expansion.

If formula_14 is a quadratic irrational, then its &quot;j&quot;-invariant formula_15 is an algebraic integer of degree formula_16, the class number of formula_17 and the minimal (monic integral) polynomial it satisfies is called the &#x27;Hilbert class polynomial&#x27;. Thus if the imaginary quadratic extension formula_17 has class number 1 (so &quot;d&quot; is a Heegner number), the &quot;j&quot;-invariant is an integer.

The &quot;q&quot;-expansion of &quot;j&quot;, with its Fourier series expansion written as a Laurent series in terms of formula_19, begins as:
formula_20

The coefficients formula_21 asymptotically grow as
formula_22
and the low order coefficients grow more slowly than formula_23, so for formula_24, &quot;j&quot; is very well approximated by its first two terms. Setting formula_25 yields
formula_26
Now
formula_27
so,
formula_28
Or,
formula_29
where the linear term of the error is,
formula_30
explaining why formula_10 is within approximately the above of being an integer.

==Pi formulas==

The Chudnovsky brothers found in 1987 that
formula_32
a proof of which uses the fact that
formula_33
For similar formulas, see the Ramanujan–Sato series.

==Other Heegner numbers==
For the four largest Heegner numbers, the approximations one obtains are as follows.
formula_34

Alternatively,
formula_35
where the reason for the squares is due to certain Eisenstein series. For Heegner numbers formula_36, one does not obtain an almost integer; even formula_37 is not noteworthy. The integer &quot;j&quot;-invariants are highly factorisable, which follows from the form
:formula_38
and factor as,
formula_39

These transcendental numbers, in addition to being closely approximated by integers (which are simply algebraic numbers of degree 1), can be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 3,
formula_40

The roots of the cubics can be exactly given by quotients of the Dedekind eta function &quot;η&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;), a modular function involving a 24th root, and which explains the 24 in the approximation. They can also be closely approximated by algebraic numbers of degree 4,
formula_41

If formula_42 denotes the expression within the parenthesis (e.g. formula_43), it satisfies respectively the quartic equations 
formula_44

Note the reappearance of the integers formula_45 as well as the fact that
formula_46
which, with the appropriate fractional power, are precisely the &quot;j&quot;-invariants.

Similarly for algebraic numbers of degree 6,
formula_47

where the &quot;x&quot;s are given respectively by the appropriate root of the sextic equations,
formula_48

with the &quot;j&quot;-invariants appearing again. These sextics are not only algebraic, they are also solvable in radicals as they factor into two cubics over the extension formula_49 (with the first factoring further into two quadratics). These algebraic approximations can be &quot;exactly&quot; expressed in terms of Dedekind eta quotients. As an example, let formula_50, then,
formula_51

where the eta quotients are the algebraic numbers given above.

==Class 2 numbers==
The three numbers 88, 148, 232, for which the imaginary quadratic field formula_1 has class number 2, are not Heegner numbers but have certain similar properties in terms of almost integers. For instance, 
formula_53
and
formula_54

==Consecutive primes==
Given an odd prime &quot;p&quot;, if one computes formula_55 for formula_56 (this is sufficient because formula_57), one gets consecutive composites, followed by consecutive primes, if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Heegner number.

<text>The European Society for Evolutionary Biology (ESEB) was founded on 28 August 1987 in Basel (Switzerland), with ~ 450 evolutionary biologists attending the inaugural congress of the Society; Arthur Cain became the Society’s first president. The founding of the ESEB was closely linked to the launching of the Society’s journal, the &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&quot;, with Stephen C. Stearns as the first Editor in Chief, and the first issue appearing in January 1988. See the editorial opening of the journal; see also Steve Stearns’ account of the early days of the ESEB.

ESEB aims at supporting the study of organic evolution. Beside publishing the &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&quot; and co-publishing &quot;Evolution Letters&quot;, the society organizes a biannual congress and supports other events to promote advances in evolutionary biology. ESEB also supports activities to promote a scientific view of organic evolution in research and education.

Since its foundation, the ESEB has grown and matured, with around 1500 members, while the &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&quot; became a major journal in the field. This reflects the growth of the evolutionary biology community in Europe and beyond, which the Society helped to foster.

ESEB supports young researchers through sponsoring the annual EMPSEB (European Meeting of PhD Students in Evolutionary Biology).

== Objectives and Activities ==
ESEB aims to support and promote the study of organic evolution and the integration of scientific fields concerned with evolution, including molecular and microbial evolution, behavior, genetics, ecology, life histories, development, paleontology, systematics, and morphology. The society organizes various activities such as workshops, conferences, and symposia to foster collaboration and dissemination of research in evolutionary biology.

== Awards and Grants ==
ESEB offers several awards and grants to support the scientific community, particularly young researchers. These include travel grants for attending conferences, mobility grants for Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows, and awards for outstanding contributions to evolutionary biology. The society&#x27;s commitment to supporting early-career scientists is evident in its sponsorship of the annual European Meeting of PhD Students in Evolutionary Biology (EMPSEB).

== Publications ==
The society&#x27;s flagship journal, the &quot;Journal of Evolutionary Biology,&quot; publishes high-quality research articles on all aspects of evolutionary biology. ESEB also co-publishes &quot;Evolution Letters,&quot; a journal focusing on rapid dissemination of significant new research in evolutionary biology. Both journals aim to provide a platform for the latest discoveries and theoretical developments in the field.

== Conferences ==
ESEB organizes a biannual congress, which serves as a major platform for evolutionary biologists to present their research, network, and discuss new developments in the field. These congresses are held in different European cities and feature a range of symposia, plenary talks, and poster sessions. The congresses are attended by scientists from around the world and are an important venue for fostering international collaboration.

== Educational Initiatives ==
ESEB is committed to promoting education in evolutionary biology. The society provides financial, organisational and strategic support to foster the growth of local evolutionary biology communities in various parts of the world, supports outreach programs, and the development of educational materials to enhance the teaching of evolutionary biology at all levels.

<text>Floyd Westerman (August 17, 1936 – December 13, 2007) was a Sisseton Dakota musician, political activist, and actor. After establishing a career as a country music singer, later in his life he became an actor, usually depicting Native American elders in American films and television. He is also credited as Floyd Red Crow Westerman. As a political activist, he spoke and marched for Native American causes.

==Early life==
He was born Floyd Westerman on the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation, home of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate, a federally recognized tribe that is one of the sub-tribes of the Eastern Dakota section of the Great Sioux Nation, located in the U.S. state of South Dakota. His Indigenous name &quot;Kanghi Duta&quot; means &quot;Red Crow&quot; in the Dakota language (which is one of the three related Siouan languages of the Great Plains).

At the age of 10, Westerman was sent to the Wahpeton Boarding School, where he first met Dennis Banks (who as an adult became a leader of the American Indian Movement). There Westerman and the other children were forced to cut their traditionally long hair and forbidden to speak their native languages. This experience would profoundly impact Westerman&#x27;s development and entire life. As an adult, he reclaimed his heritage and became an outspoken advocate for Indigenous cultural preservation.

Westerman graduated from Northern State University with a B.A. degree in secondary education. He served two years in the U.S. Marine Corps, before beginning his career as a country singer.

==Career==
Before entering films and television, Westerman had established a solid reputation as a country-western music singer. In his songwriting he explored and critiqued the European influences on Native American communities. In addition to several solo recordings, Westerman collaborated with Jackson Browne, Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Harry Belafonte, Joni Mitchell, Kris Kristofferson, and Buffy Sainte-Marie. In the 1990s, he toured with Sting to raise funds to preserve the endangered rain forests.

After years performing as a singer, Westerman became interested in acting. His film debut was in &quot;Renegades&quot; (1989), in which he played &quot;Red Crow&quot;, the Lakota Sioux father of Hank Storm, played by Lou Diamond Phillips. Additional film roles include &quot;Chief Ten Bears&quot; in &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; (1990), and the &quot;shaman&quot; for the singer Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Doors&quot; (1991). Westerman appeared as Standing Elk, alongside his long-time friend Max Gail, in the family film, &quot;Tillamook Treasure&quot; (2006). He appeared in &quot;Hidalgo&quot; (2004), as Chief Eagle Horn in Buffalo Bill&#x27;s circus. In September 2007, Westerman finished work for the film &quot;Swing Vote&quot; (2008).

Television roles included playing &quot;George&quot; on Dharma &amp; Greg, &quot;Uncle Ray&quot; on &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; (in the pilot and first regular seasons), &quot;One Who Waits&quot; on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, and multiple appearances as &quot;Albert Hosteen&quot; on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Westerman also did numerous Public Service Announcements for television including for the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio in 1992.

==Death==
Westerman died from complications of leukemia at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on December 13, 2007. He was survived by his wife Rosie, four daughters, and a son.

<text>In organic chemistry, an imine ( or ) is a functional group or organic compound containing a carbon–nitrogen double bond (). The nitrogen atom can be attached to a hydrogen or an organic group (R). The carbon atom has two additional single bonds. Imines are common in synthetic and naturally occurring compounds and they participate in many reactions.

Distinction is sometimes made between aldimines and ketimines, derived from aldehydes and ketones, respectively.

==Structure==
In imines the five core atoms (C2C=NX, ketimine; and C(H)C=NX, aldimine; X = H or C) are coplanar. Planarity results from the sp2-hybridization of the mutually double-bonded carbon and the nitrogen atoms. The C=N distance is 1.29–1.31 Å for nonconjugated imines and 1.35 Å for conjugated imines. By contrast, C−N distances in amines and nitriles are 1.47 and 1.16 Å respectively. Rotation about the C=N bond is slow. Using NMR spectroscopy, both &quot;E&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; isomers of aldimines have been detected. Owing to steric effects, the &quot;E&quot; isomer is favored.

==Nomenclature and classification==
The term &quot;imine&quot; was coined in 1883 by the German chemist Albert Ladenburg.

Usually imines refer to compounds with the general formula R2C=NR, as discussed below. In the older literature, imine refers to the &quot;aza&quot;-analogue of an epoxide. Thus, &quot;ethylenimine&quot; is the three-membered ring species aziridine C2H4NH. The relationship of imines to amines having double and single bonds can be correlated with imides and amides, as in succinimide vs acetamide. 

Imines are related to ketones and aldehydes by replacement of the oxygen with an NR group. When R = H, the compound is a primary imine, when R is hydrocarbyl, the compound is a secondary imine. If this group is &quot;not&quot; a hydrogen atom, then the compound can sometimes be referred to as a Schiff base. When R3 is OH, the imine is called an oxime, and when R3 is NH2 the imine is called a hydrazone.

A primary imine in which C is attached to both a hydrocarbyl and a H (derived from an aldehyde) is called a primary aldimine; a secondary imine with such groups is called a secondary aldimine. A primary imine in which C is attached to two hydrocarbyls (derived from a ketone) is called a primary ketimine; a secondary imine with such groups is called a secondary ketimine.


N-Sulfinyl imines are a special class of imines having a sulfinyl group attached to the nitrogen atom.

==Synthesis of imines==
===Carbonyl-amine condensation===

Imines are typically prepared by the condensation of primary amines and aldehydes. Ketones undergo similar reactions, but less commonly than aldehydes. In terms of mechanism, such reactions proceed via the nucleophilic addition giving a hemiaminal -C(OH)(NHR)- intermediate, followed by an elimination of water to yield the imine (see alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution for a detailed mechanism). The equilibrium in this reaction usually favors the carbonyl compound and amine, so that azeotropic distillation or use of a dehydrating agent, such as molecular sieves or magnesium sulfate, is required to favor of imine formation. In recent years, several reagents such as Tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)borate [B(OCH2CF3)3], pyrrolidine or titanium ethoxide [Ti(OEt)4] have been shown to catalyse imine formation.

Rarer than primary amines is the use of ammonia to give a primary imine. In the case of hexafluoroacetone, the hemiaminal intermediate can be isolated.

===From nitriles===
Primary ketimines can be synthesized via a Grignard reaction with a nitrile. This method is known as Moureu-Mignonac ketimine synthesis. For example, benzophenone imine can also be synthesized by addition of phenylmagnesium bromide to benzonitrile followed by careful hydrolysis (lest the imine be hydrolyzed): 
:C6H5CN + C6H5MgBr → (C6H5)2C=NMgBr
:(C6H5)2C=NMgBr + H2O → (C6H5)2C=NH + MgBr(OH)

===Specialized methods===

Several other methods exist for the synthesis of imines.
* Reaction of organic azides with metal carbenoids (produced from diazocarbonyl compounds).
* The reaction of iminophosphoranes and organic azides in an Aza-Wittig-reaction.
* Condensation of carbon acids with nitroso compounds.
* The rearrangement of trityl N-haloamines in the Stieglitz rearrangement.
* By reaction of alkenes with hydrazoic acid in the Schmidt reaction.
* By reaction of a nitrile, hydrochloric acid, and an arene in the Hoesch reaction.
* Multicomponent synthesis of 3-thiazolines in the Asinger reaction.
* Thermal decomposition of oximes.

==Reactions==
===Hydrolysis===
The chief reaction of imines, often undesirable, is their hydrolysis back to the amine and the carbonyl precursor.
:R2C=NR&#x27; + H2O R2C=O + R&#x27;NH2

===Precursors to heterocycles===
Imines are widely used as intermediates in the synthesis of heterocycles. 
*Aromatic imines react with an enol ether to a quinoline in the Povarov reaction. 
*Imines react, thermally, with ketenes in [2+2] cycloadditions to form β-lactams in the Staudinger synthesis. Several variants have been described.
*Imine react with dienes in the Imine Diels-Alder reaction to a tetrahydropyridine.
*tosylimines react with α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound to give allylic amines in the Aza-Baylis–Hillman reaction.

===Acid-base reactions===
Somewhat like the parent amines, imines are mildly basic and reversibly protonate to give iminium salts: 
:R2C=NR&#x27; + H+ [R2C=NHR&#x27;]+

Alternatively, primary imines are sufficiently acidic to allow N-alkylation, as illustrated with benzophenone imine:
:(C6H5)2C=NH + CH3Li → (C6H5)2C=NLi + CH4
:(C6H5)2C=NLi + CH3I → (C6H5)2C=NCH3 + LiI

===Lewis acid-base reactions===
Imines are common ligands in coordination chemistry. Particularly popular examples are found with Schiff base ligands derived from salicylaldehyde, the salen ligands. Metal-catalyzed reactions of imines proceed through such complexes. In classical coordination complexes, imines bind metals through nitrogen. For low-valent metals, η2-imine ligands are observed.

===Nucleophilic additions===
Very analogous to ketones and aldehydes, primary imines are susceptible to attack by carbanion equivalents. The method allow for the synthesis of secondary amines:
:R2C=NR&#x27; + R&quot;Li → R2R&quot;CN(Li)R&#x27;
:R2R&quot;CN(Li)R&#x27; + H2O → R2R&quot;CNHR&#x27; + LiOH

This can be expanded to include enolisable carbons in the Mannich reaction, which is a straightforward and commonly used approach for producing β-amino-carbonyl compounds.

===Imine reductions===

Imines are reduced via reductive amination. An imine can be reduced to an amine via hydrogenation for example in a synthesis of &quot;m&quot;-tolylbenzylamine:

Other reducing agents are lithium aluminium hydride and sodium borohydride.

The asymmetric reduction of imines has been achieved by hydrosilylation using a rhodium-DIOP catalyst. Many systems have since been investigated.

Owing to their enhanced electrophilicity, iminium derivatives are particularly susceptible to reduction to the amines. Such reductions can be achieved by transfer hydrogenation or by the stoichiometric action of sodium cyanoborohydride. Since imines derived from unsymmetrical ketones are prochiral, their reduction defines a route to chiral amines.

===Polymerisation===
Unhindered aldimines tend to cyclize, as illustrated by the condensation of methylamine and formaldehyde, which gives the hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine.

Imine polymers (polyimines) can be synthesised from multivalent aldehydes and amines. The polymerisation reaction proceeds directly when the aldehyde and amine monomers are mixed together at room temperature. In most cases, (small) amounts of solvent may still be required. Polyimines are particularly interesting materials because of their application as vitrimers. Owing to the dynamic covalent nature of the imine bonds, polyimines can be recycled relatively easily. Furthermore, polyimines are known for their self-healing behaviour.

===Miscellaneous reactions===
Akin to pinacol couplings, imines are susceptible to reductive coupling leading to 1,2-diamines.
Imine are oxidized with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) to give an oxaziridines.

Imines are intermediates in the alkylation of amines with formic acid in the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction.

A rearrangement in carbohydrate chemistry involving an imine is the Amadori rearrangement.

A methylene transfer reaction of an imine by an unstabilised sulphonium ylide can give an aziridine system.
Imine react with dialkylphosphite in the Pudovik reaction and Kabachnik–Fields reaction

==Biological role==
Imines are common in nature. The pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes (PLP enzymes) catalyze myriad reactions involving aldimines (or Schiff bases). Cyclic imines are also substrates for many imine reductase enzymes.

<text>Mordecai Peter Centennial Brown (October 19, 1876 – February 14, 1948), nicknamed &quot;Three Finger Brown&quot; or &quot;Miner&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball pitcher and manager during the first two decades of the 20th century (known as the &quot;dead-ball era&quot;). Due to a farm-machinery accident in his youth (April 17, 1888), Brown lost parts of two fingers on his right hand, and in the process gained a colorful nickname. He turned this handicap into an advantage by learning how to grip a baseball in a way that resulted in an exceptional curveball (or knuckle curve), which broke radically before reaching the plate. With this technique he became one of the elite pitchers of his era.

Brown was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1949.

==Early life==
Brown was born in Nyesville, Indiana, to Jane and Peter Brown. He was also known as &quot;Miner&quot;, having worked in western Indiana coal mines for a while before beginning his professional baseball career. Nicknames like &quot;Miner&quot; (or misspelled as &quot;Minor&quot;) and &quot;Three Finger&quot; (or sometimes &quot;Three-Fingered&quot;) were headline writers&#x27; inventions. To fans and friends he was probably best known as &quot;Brownie&quot;. To his relatives and close friends, he was also known as &quot;Mort&quot;. His three-part given name came from the names of his uncle, his father, and the United States Centennial year of his birth, respectively.
According to his biography, he had two separate injuries to his right hand. The first and more famous trauma came when he was feeding material into the farm&#x27;s feed chopper. He slipped and his hand was mangled by the knives, severing much of his index finger and damaging the others. A doctor repaired the rest of his hand as best he could. While it was still healing, the injury was further aggravated by a fall he took, which broke several finger bones. They were not reset properly, especially the middle finger (see photo).

He learned to pitch, as many children did, by aiming rocks at knot-holes on the barn wall and other wooden surfaces. Over time, with constant practice, he developed great control. As a &quot;bonus&quot;, the manner in which he had to grip the ball (see photo) resulted in an unusual amount of spin. This allowed him to throw an effective curve ball (or knuckle curve), and a deceptive fast ball and change-up. The extra topspin made it difficult for batters to connect solidly. In short, he &quot;threw ground balls&quot; and was exceptionally effective.

==Career==
Brown was a third baseman in semipro baseball in 1898 when his team&#x27;s pitcher failed to appear for a game and Brown was put in to pitch. Players in the league quickly noticed the spin and movement created by Brown&#x27;s unusual grip. Fred Massey, Brown&#x27;s great-nephew, said, &quot;It didn&#x27;t only curve, it curved and dropped at the same time&quot;, Massey said. &quot;It made it extremely hard to hit and if you did hit it, you hit it into the ground [because you] couldn&#x27;t get under it.&quot; After a spectacular minor league career commencing in Terre Haute of the Three-I League in 1901, Brown came to the majors rather late, at age 26, in 1903, and lasted until 1916 when he was close to 40.

Brown&#x27;s most productive period was when he played for the Chicago Cubs from 1904 through 1912. During this stretch, he won 20 or more games six times and was part of two World Series championships. New York Giants manager John McGraw regarded his own Christy Mathewson and Brown as the two best pitchers in the National League. In fact, Brown defeated Mathewson in competition as often as not, most significantly in the final regular season game of the 1908 season. Brown had a career 13–11 edge on Mathewson, with one no-decision in their 25 pitching matchups.

Brown&#x27;s most important single game effort was the pennant-deciding contest between the Cubs and the New York Giants on October 8, 1908, at New York. With Mathewson starting for the Giants, Cubs starter Jack Pfiester got off to a weak start and was quickly relieved by Brown, who held the Giants in check the rest of the way as the Cubs prevailed 4–2, to win the pennant. The Cubs then went on to win their second consecutive World Series championship, their last until 2016, a span of 108 years.

In late 1909, Brown was on a team that played some games in Cuba. He planned to spend the winter there, but returned home when he caught a mysterious sickness. Brown saw limited action in 1912 and was released by the Cubs in October, a week before he turned 36. Soon after, he consulted a physician about a minor illness. Examining Brown&#x27;s knee, the physician advised Brown to retire from baseball because he risked losing the use of his leg. However, Brown continued to play, signing with the Louisville Colonels, who traded him to the Cincinnati Reds for the 1913 season.

After the 1913 season, Brown jumped to the Federal League, signing his contract on the same day as Joe Tinker. While Tinker went to the Chicago Whales, Brown was the player-manager for the St. Louis Terriers in 1914. Brown was dismissed as manager in August, then finished the season with the Brooklyn Tip-Tops, and was rumored to retire again in October 1914. He stayed in the league and played for the Chicago Whales in 1915. He returned to the Cubs for his final season in 1916. Brown and Mathewson wrapped their respective careers by squaring off on September 4, 1916, in the second game of a Labor Day doubleheader. The game was billed as the final meeting between the two old baseball warriors, and would turn out to be the final game in each of their careers. The game was a high-scoring one, the two teams combining for 33 hits. But with both teams well back in the pennant race, the two men pitched the entire game. Mathewson&#x27;s Reds prevailed 10–8 over Brown&#x27;s Cubs, as the Cubs&#x27; ninth-inning rally fell short.

Brown finished his major league career with a 239–130 record, 1375 strikeouts, and a 2.06 ERA, the third best ERA in Major League Baseball history amongst players inducted into the Hall of Fame, after Ed Walsh and Addie Joss. His 2.06 ERA is the best in MLB history for any pitcher with more than 200 wins. Brown was a switch-hitter, which was and is unusual for a pitcher. He took some pride in his hitting, and had a fair batting average for a pitcher, compiling a career .206 batting average (235-for-1143) with 93 runs, 2 home runs and 73 RBI.

==Later life and legacy==
Following his retirement from the majors, he returned to his home in Terre Haute, where he continued to pitch in the minor leagues and in exhibition games for more than a decade, as well as coaching and managing. According to his biography, in an exhibition game against the famous House of David touring team in 1928, at the age of 51, he pitched three innings as a favor to the local team, and struck out all nine batters he faced.

From 1920 to 1945, Brown ran a filling station in Terre Haute that also served as a town gathering place and an unofficial museum. He was also a frequent guest at Old-Timers&#x27; games in Chicago. In his later years, Brown was plagued by diabetes and then by the effects of a stroke in 1947. He died in 1948 of diabetic complications. He was posthumously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in May 1949 alongside Kid Nichols.

F. Scott Fitzgerald refers to &quot;Three-finger Brown&quot; in his first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; (1920). The television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; made reference to Brown in &quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;, when Mr. Burns lists three ringers he wants for his company&#x27;s softball team: Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, and Mordecai &quot;Three Finger&quot; Brown. Smithers has to point out that they are not only retired, but long-dead. He was referenced again by Mr. Burns in the episode &quot;The Last Traction Hero&quot;.

In 1999, he was named as a finalist to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

Between Brown and Antonio Alfonseca, the Cubs have featured both a &quot;three-fingered&quot; pitcher and a six-fingered pitcher on their all-time roster (Brown technically had four, including the thumb).

<text>The Barcelona chair is a chair designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Lilly Reich, for the German Pavilion at the International Exposition of 1929, hosted by Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

The chair was first used in Villa Tugendhat, a private residence, designed by Mies in Brno (Czech Republic).

==Materials and manufacture==
The frame was initially designed to be bolted together but was redesigned in 1950 using stainless steel, which allowed the frame to be formed with a seamless piece of metal, giving it a smoother appearance. Bovine leather replaced the ivory-colored pigskin which was used for the original pieces.

==Philosophy and ergonomics==
Although many architects and furniture designers of the Bauhaus era were intent on providing well-designed homes and impeccably manufactured furnishings for common people, the Barcelona chair was an exception. It was designed for Spanish royalty to oversee the opening ceremonies of the exhibition and was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as inhabiting a &quot;sumptuous German pavilion.&quot; The form is thought to be extrapolated from Roman folding chairs known as the Curule chair upholstered stools used by the Roman aristocracy. According to Knoll Inc., despite its industrial appearance the Barcelona chair requires much hand crafting.

==Current production==
Since 1953 Knoll Inc has manufactured the Barcelona chair in both chrome and stainless steel. The chairs are almost completely hand-crafted, and each carries a facsimile of van der Rohe&#x27;s signature, stamped into its frame. 


Unlicensed replicas of the original design are made by other manufacturers worldwide and are sold under different marketing names. Such designs are frequently subject to legal challenges.

==In popular culture==
In his 1981 book about modern architecture, &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House&quot;, Tom Wolfe called the Barcelona chair as &quot;the Platonic ideal of the chair&quot;, and wrote that, despite its high price, owning one had become a necessity for young architects: &quot;When you saw the holy object on the sisal rug, you knew you were in a household where a fledgling architect and his young wife had sacrificed everything to bring the symbol of the godly mission into their home.&quot;

<doc id="522190" wikidata="Q2756642" url="?curid=522190" title="Vox humana">
<text>The vox humana (Latin for &quot;human voice&quot;; also &quot;voz humana&quot; in Spanish and Portuguese, &quot;voix humaine&quot; in French and &quot;voce umana&quot; in Italian, although &quot;voce umana&quot; is also a term for a &quot;celeste&quot; stop, q.v.) is a short-resonator reed stop on the pipe organ, so named because of its supposed resemblance to the human voice. As a rule, the stop is used with a tremulant, which undulates the wind supply, causing a vibrato effect. The vox humana is intended to evoke the impression of a singing choir or soloist, though the success of this intent depends as much upon the acoustics of the room in which the organ speaks as it does the voicing of the pipes. It is almost invariably at 8 ft pitch, though on theater organs it is not uncommon to encounter a chorus of vox humana stops unified at 16 ft, 8 ft and occasionally 4 ft pitch on the Great manual and 8 ft and 4 ft pitch on the Accompaniment manual.

The vox humana is one of the oldest reeds in organ building, based on its appearance in very early instruments. It is common on French classical organs in the 17th and 18th centuries, where it was used as a solo voice. The vox humana also appears on German and Dutch organs of the period, though not as frequently as in France. French organs in the 19th and 20th centuries almost invariably featured a voix humaine in the Récit (the most commonly enclosed division of the French romantic organ), though by this time the literature had evolved and it was used to play rich, harmonic chordal progressions. Many American organs built in the romantic style include a vox humana in order to facilitate the playing of this literature.

Vox humana stops in very old organs had a fairly wide variety of designs and tonal qualities. It was during the nineteenth century that the design became fairly standardized. Today, most builders construct vox humana pipes in approximately the same way, though the scaling will vary between builders and according to the tonal style in which the organ is designed. The actual sound of the pipe is dependent upon the voicer, with an open &quot;O&quot; or a long &quot;E&quot; sound probably being the most common result.

<text>The Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade, also known as Brutinel&#x27;s Brigade or the Brutinel Brigade, was the first fully motorized unit of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) during the First World War. It was established on August 24, 1914, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by Canadian Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel, who initiated the program and was the unit&#x27;s first commander. The unit played a significant part in halting the major German spring offensive of March 1918, and in the final Hundred Days Offensive when it was part of the Canadian Independent Force (CIF) commanded by Brutinel.

== History ==
The brigade was originally equipped with eight Armoured Autocars mounting two Colt Model 1914 machine guns (later replaced with the standard British Vickers MG) manufactured by Autocar in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. Autocar also supplied six unarmoured support vehicles, four &quot;roadsters&quot; for the brigade&#x27;s officers, and an ambulance.

Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig wrote that the &quot;work of the 1st CMMG Brigade in recent operations has proved the value that can be obtained from such units, and recommends the formation of a 2nd Brigade be undertaken forthwith.&quot; So in May 1918 the 2nd Canadian Motor MG Brigade was added. With the new unit Brutinel&#x27;s CIF consisted of the 1st and 2nd Motor Machine Gun Brigade (each of 5x8 gun batteries), Canadian Corps Cyclist Battalion, one section of medium trench-mortars mounted on lorries (plus an assumed wireless and medical support). This totaled 80 machine guns and about 300 bicycle infantry. Canadian historian John A. English points out that this &quot;was the first mechanized formation in the Commonwealth armies and the forerunner of the armoured division.&quot;

==Structure==
By June 1916 there were five batteries in the brigade:
* A Battery (Armoured Autocar)
* B Battery (Armoured Autocar)
* C Battery (Machine Gunners)
* D Battery (Machine Gunners)
* E Battery (Machine Gunners)

<doc id="522192" wikidata="Q2602701" url="?curid=522192" title="Schiff base">
<text>In organic chemistry, a Schiff base (named after Hugo Schiff) is a compound with the general structure ( = alkyl or aryl, but not hydrogen). They can be considered a sub-class of imines, being either secondary ketimines or secondary aldimines depending on their structure. Anil refers to a common subset of Schiff bases: imines derived from anilines. The term can be synonymous with azomethine which refers specifically to secondary aldimines (i.e. where R&#x27; ≠ H).

== Synthesis ==
Schiff bases can be synthesized from an aliphatic or aromatic amine and a carbonyl compound by nucleophilic addition forming a hemiaminal, followed by a dehydration to generate an imine. In a typical reaction, 4,4&#x27;-oxydianiline reacts with &quot;o&quot;-vanillin:

Schiff bases can also be synthesized via the Aza-Wittig reaction.

== Biochemistry ==
Schiff bases have been investigated in relation to a wide range of contexts, including antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer activity. They have also been considered for the inhibition of amyloid-β aggregation.

Schiff bases are common enzymatic intermediates where an amine, such as the terminal group of a lysine residue, reversibly reacts with an aldehyde or ketone of a cofactor or substrate. The common enzyme cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) forms a Schiff base with a lysine residue and is transaldiminated to the substrate(s). Similarly, the cofactor retinal forms a Schiff base in rhodopsins, including human rhodopsin (via Lysine 296), which is key in the photoreception mechanism.

==Coordination chemistry==
The term Schiff base is normally applied to these compounds when they are being used as ligands to form coordination complexes with metal ions. One example is Jacobsen&#x27;s catalyst. The imine nitrogen is basic and exhibits pi-acceptor properties. Several, especially the diiminopyridines are noninnocent ligands. Many Schiff base ligands are derived from alkyl diamines and aromatic aldehydes.

Chiral Schiff bases were one of the first ligands used for asymmetric catalysis. In 1968 Ryōji Noyori developed a copper-Schiff base complex for the metal-carbenoid cyclopropanation of styrene. Schiff bases have also been incorporated into metal–organic frameworks (MOF).

==Conjugated Schiff bases==
Conjugated Schiff bases absorb strongly in the UV-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. This absorption is the basis of the anisidine value, which is a measure of oxidative spoilage for fats and oils.

<doc id="522212" wikidata="Q1446290" url="?curid=522212" title="Organ stop">
<text>An organ stop is a component of a pipe organ that admits pressurized air (known as &quot;wind&quot;) to a set of organ pipes. Its name comes from the fact that stops can be used selectively by the organist; each can be &quot;on&quot; (admitting the passage of air to certain pipes), or &quot;off&quot; (&quot;stopping&quot; the passage of air to certain pipes).

The term can also refer to the control that operates this mechanism, commonly called a stop tab, stop knob, or drawknob. On electric or electronic organs that imitate a pipe organ, the same terms are often used, with the exception of the Hammond organ and clonewheel organs, which use the term &quot;drawbar&quot;.

The term is also sometimes used as a synonym for register, referring to rank(s) of pipes controlled by a single stop. [[Registration (organ)|Registration]] is the art of combining stops to produce a certain sound. The phrase , which once only meant to engage all of the voices on the organ, has entered general usage, for deploying all available means to pursue a goal.

==Mechanics==

Organ pipes are physically organized within the organ into sets according to note and timbre. A set of pipes producing the same timbre for each note is called a &quot;rank&quot;, while each key on a pipe organ controls a &quot;note&quot; which may be sounded by different ranks of pipes, alone or in combination. The use of stops enables the organist to selectively turn off (&quot;stop&quot;) certain ranks in order to produce different combinations of sounds, as opposed to hearing all sounds simultaneously. A stop may be linked to a single or multiple ranks. While nowadays one speaks of &quot;drawing&quot; a stop to select a particular rank or set of ranks, the earliest organs were constructed with all ranks &quot;on&quot; by default.

The mechanism for operating the stops varies widely, but the principle is the same: the stop control at the console allows the organist to select which ranks of pipes will sound when a key is pressed. When the organist desires a rank to sound, they operate the corresponding control at the console, allowing wind to flow to the pipes. Likewise, the organist can deny wind to the pipes by operating the same control in the opposite direction. Common stop controls include &quot;stop knobs&quot;, which move in and out of the console, and &quot;stop tabs&quot;, which toggle back and forth in position.

Some organs, particularly smaller historical organs from England, Spain or Portugal, feature &quot;divided registers&quot;, in which there are two stop knobs for certain ranks. One stop knob will control the upper portion of the keyboard, and the other will control the lower portion of the keyboard. This arrangement allows the upper portion of the keyboard to sound a different registration than the lower portion, which lends a greater versatility to smaller organs, especially those with only one manual.

Ranks which are neither divided nor extended (see below Unification, borrowing and extension) generally contain as many pipes as there are keys on the keyboard to which they are assigned: in most cases 61 pipes for a rank assigned to a manual and 32 pipes for a rank assigned to the pedal.

===Methods of actuation===
Over the course of the history of the pipe organ, there have been several different designs by which stops are actuated. In the longest-standing design, known as the &quot;slider chest&quot;, there is a strip of material (typically wood) called a &quot;slider&quot; which fits underneath a given rank of pipes. The slider has small holes drilled in it, one for each pipe in the rank. When the stop is set such that pipes are inactive, the holes are misaligned with the pipes, preventing the air from flowing up into the pipes above. When the stop is set such that the pipes are active, the slider moves over, aligning the holes with the pipes, allowing air to reach them. Because the slider chest was developed before the advent of electricity, it is inherently mechanical in nature. Many organs originally built with mechanical actuators have been retrofitted with electric actuators.

Other common designs include the spring chest, the cone valve chest, and the Pitman chest.

===Unification, borrowing and extension===
The term &quot;unification&quot; refers to the practice of expanding the tonal resources of an organ without adding more pipes by allowing several different stops to control the same rank of pipes. For example, an 8′ Gedeckt may also be made available as a 4′ Gedeckt, either on the same or a different manual. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, C3) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (C3), and the pipe one octave above that (C4).

&quot;Borrowing&quot; or &quot;duplexing&quot; refers to one rank being made available from multiple stop knobs, often on different manuals or pedal. &quot;Extension&quot; refers to the addition of extra pipes to the high and/or low ends of a rank in order to allow that rank to be borrowed by higher and/or lower stops. Unification and borrowing (duplexing) is mostly related to pipe organs with physical pipes; however, some (older) electronic organs also used unification and duplexing to expand the tonal resources of a limited number of synthesized virtual ranks.

While unification and extension increase the tonal resources and flexibility of the organ, greater care needs to be taken by the organist in registering the organ, particularly when the composition requires many notes to sound at the same time. In a non-unified organ, voices are scaled for their intended job. As an example, the octave (4′) diapason is generally of a smaller scale and softer than the corresponding 8′ diapason rank, whereas in unification they would be of the same strength due to using the same set of pipes. Straight reed choruses (16′, 8′ and 4′) have the luxury of ranks with different timbres, whereas a unified reed chorus has voices that are identical.

Playing with all stops out on a heavily unified/duplexed organ may result in chords that sound thinner or emphasize higher harmonics on some notes more than others, due to notes in different octaves using the same pipes instead of having their own. Part of an organist&#x27;s training is to detect unification and duplexing and to create registrations that take them into account. Nonetheless, heavy unification can create issues for visiting artists with limited practice times, or those improvising compositions.

Borrowing between manuals occurs in English organs from about 1700, but extension of pipe ranks for the purpose of borrowing at different pitches is a relatively recent development. Extension and unification are heavily used in theatre organs to produce the maximum number of voices from a minimal number of pipes. It is still typical to see a significant amount of unification and duplexing in practice organs and small church organs. Traditionally, less use has been made of extension in large church organs and those designed for classical music, with authorities tending to regard borrowing in general and extension in particular as things to be avoided if possible, except in a few cases where space for pipes is limited, making extension and/or unification necessary. Borrowing 16′ manual ranks for the pedal division is more widely employed because of the expense and space requirements of 16′ stops and the versatility this allows.

==Pitch and length==

The pitch produced by an organ pipe is a function of its length. All else equal, longer pipes produce lower-pitched notes, and shorter pipes are higher in pitch. An organ stop uses a set (rank) of pipes of graduated lengths to produce the range of notes needed. Stops with pipes tuned to sound the pitch normally associated with the keys (i.e. the pitch of the same keys on a piano) are called &quot;unison stops&quot;. Other stops use pipework that is longer or shorter than that of unison ranks to speak at a fixed interval above or below unison pitch (&quot;octave pitch&quot; or &quot;mutation pitch&quot;).

The pitch of a rank of pipes is denoted by a number on the stop knob. A stop which speaks at unison pitch, or &quot;native pitch&quot;, is known as an 8′ (pronounced &quot;eight-foot&quot;) stop. This nomenclature refers to the approximate length of the longest pipe in a rank of open pipes. In a rank of stopped pipes, the lowest pipe is about 4 feet long, but because it sounds at unison pitch, it is also known as an 8′ stop.

===Octaves===
The octave sounded by a given pipe is inversely proportional to its length (half the length = double the pitch), meaning that a 4′ stop speaks exactly one octave higher than an 8′ stop. Likewise, a 2′ stop speaks one octave higher than a 4′ stop. Conversely, a 16′ stop speaks one octave below an 8&#x27; stop; and a 32′ stop speaks one octave below a 16′ stop. Octave pitch lengths used in actual organs include 64′, 32′, 16′, 8′, 4′, 2′, 1′, ′, and ′.

Example:
===Mutations and resultants===
Ranks that do not speak at the unison or some octave of the unison pitch are called &quot;mutation&quot; stops, or sometimes &quot;aliquots&quot;. They are rarely used on their own; rather, they are combined with unison stops to create different tone colors. A typical and distinctive sound of the organ is the cornet, composed of a flute and ranks making up its first four overtones, sounding 8′, 4′, ′ (labeled 3′ on some German and Swedish organs), 2′, and ′ (or ′ on some German organs).

The sounding length of a mutation stop gives the answer as to what pitch the rank sounds. For example, a stop labeled ′ (or one-third of 8′) has three times the frequency; i.e., the interval of a twelfth above unison pitch. This third harmonic (G) (twelfth, quint, qvinta, rorkvint, or nazard [nasard]) is the most-common pitch, followed by the fifth harmonic (E) (tierce [terz or ters on some organs]) (′) and sixth (G) (larigot, nasat) (′), with rarer examples from higher in the series, such as the &quot;&quot;septième&quot; or &quot;septima&quot; (′) and &quot;none&quot;&quot; (′). There&#x27;s also an ′ Major 7th which when C is played sounds a B below the top C of a piano.

Mutations usually sound at pitches in the harmonic series of the fundamental, and except when derived from unified ranks, are always tuned pure. Some organs contain mutations that are overtones of 16′ or 32′ to create difference tones, e.g., quint-bass ′. Such &quot;helper ranks&quot; that sound at the fifth just above or fourth below the fundamental (e.g., Bourdon 16′), can create the impression of a stop an octave lower than the fundamental (e.g., Bourdon 32′), saving the space and money otherwise needed for larger bass pipes; such an effect is termed a &quot;resultant&quot;.

This is a list of some mutation stops.

===Mixtures===
Certain stops called &quot;mixtures&quot; contain multiple ranks of pipes above unison pitch, usually octave and fifths. The number of ranks in a mixture is denoted by a Roman numeral on the stop knob; for example, a stop labeled &quot;Mixture V&quot; would contain five pipes for every note. So, for every key pressed, five different pipes sound (all controlled by the same stop). A mixture made of octaves and fifths is called a &#x27;quint mixture&#x27;, while a mixture made of octaves, fifths, and a major third is called a &#x27;tierce mixture&#x27;. As a rule, the fifths and thirds of mixtures are tuned pure in relation to the fundamental. For thirds, the 14 cent discrepancy between the just and equal tempered interval is large enough to introduce noticeable beating in chords, and tierce mixtures became uncommon with the abandonment of meantone temperaments.

Mixtures have numbers that correspond to the pitch they make. For example, a mixture configured as: 12.15.19.22 contains, at its lowest note, the following ranks: ′, 2′, ′, 1′.

Mixtures usually have &#x27;breaks&#x27; to prevent the inconvenience to the builder of making very small pipes at the top of the compass. A common configuration for the breaks is that for every octave the mixture lowers by a fifth.

==== Cornet ====
A cornet organ stop is similar to a mixture, but they are primarily used as solo voices, though their sound is not imitative of the orchestral cornet. A cornet will always contain the fifth and major third, and, depending on the number of ranks, may contain octaves, and more rarely the minor seventh, and ninth. Cornet pipes are made of metal and voiced as flutes; the 8′ rank is usually made of stopped metal pipes. The ranks will be justly tuned to reinforce the fundamental.

The most common configuration of ranks for an 8′ fundamental is as follows: II = 12.17; III = 12.15.17; IV = 8.12.15.17; V = 1.8.12.15.17.

Cornet stops do not usually play the full compass; they generally play from either Middle C, or Tenor C, to the top. In British and French organs before the Victorian period, this allowed the Cornet stop to be raised up within the case relative to the other pipes of the Great organ around it for better projection; this is known as a &#x27;Mounted Cornet&#x27; in English and &#x27;Cornet Séparée&#x27; in French. Though used throughout Europe, the Cornet is especially associated with French organ builders, who used Cornets with particular regularity especially through the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, since French chorus reed stops (Trompette, Bombarde, Clairon) are very strong in the bass (having un-weighted tongues) but, when on low wind pressures, comparatively weak further up the compass; the Cornet was therefore used to strengthen the treble ranges of these chorus reed stops. A characteristic example of this use is the classic French registration known as the &#x27;Grand Jeu&#x27;: a combination of Trompettes, Clairons and Cornets, together with the Prestant (by contrast the &#x27;Plein Jeu&#x27; does not include cornets).

In French organs, when an 8 ft Bourdon was used with 4′ and 2′ stops plus a Nasard and Tierce the resulting ensemble was known as a &#x27;Cornet Décomposée&#x27; (often confused with the &#x27;Cornet Séparée&#x27; described above) since it had the same composition as a standalone Cornet stop.

Occasionally Cornets are supplied based on a 16′ fundamental (16′, 8′, ′, 4′ and ′), though the individual ranks are more usually configured as separate stops (for example the Grande Tierce ′ and Grand Nasard ′ supplied by the Isnard brothers at St Maximin, Provence). Cornet stops in 32′ are also known, as they are able to approximate the sound of a 32′ reed stop without the using pipes of the same bulk or expense (as used for example by John Compton at Wakefield Cathedral, England).

==== Sesquialtera ====
A Sesquialtera (or Sexquialtera) is similar to a Cornet in that it always contains a fifth and major third (justly tuned), though they normally extend to the whole range of the compass. They also rarely go beyond IV ranks, the most common being found at II or III ranks. They are not necessarily as uniform in configuration as the Cornet and so the quint and tierce ranks can be placed anywhere in the configuration. For example, the configurations: 15.17.19, 17.19.22, and 19.22.24 are all equally valid as the configurations for a Sesquialtera.

Sesquialtera stops can be solo or chorus stops. The British Victorian Sesquialtera was often the only Mixture stop on a given department (usually the Great or Swell organ; rarely the Choir organ), typically starting at 17.19.22 and then breaking back to 12.15.17 further up the compass and intended to be used in the chorus to help blend reed and flue stops together. By contrast, the Dutch, German and Scandinavian Sesquialteras of the seventeenth and eighteenth century were solo stops (typically 12.17), often (though by no means exclusively) found in the Rückpositiv division, from whose gallery-edge case position they could project a solo line well into acoustic space against an accompaniment using stops in the main organ case; such Sesquialteras are therefore particularly associated with Lutheran chorale-based organ repertoire.

Sesquialteras are often distinguished from Cornet stops because whereas Cornets (especially French examples) use wide-scaled, flute-toned pipes, Sesquialteras were generally made from narrower, principal-toned pipes (though this distinction is somewhat less widely observed in 20th-century organs than earlier organs). Sesquialteras therefore often have a sharper sound than Cornets.

==Nomenclature==
Pipe ranks have particular names, which depend on a number of factors ranging from the physical and tone attributes of the pipes in that rank, to the country and era in which the organ was manufactured, to the pipes&#x27; physical location within the organ. Each stop knob is labeled with the name of the rank it controls. In general, that label gives the organist two vital pieces of information about the rank of pipes in question:
* which octave of pitches the rank is natively tuned to
* which tone quality the rank possesses (principal, trumpet, flute, etc.)

This is an example of a pipe organ &quot;stoplist&quot;, showing both common stop names and conventional formatting. Within each division, flues are listed before reeds, then low to high pitch, then louder to softer stops within a pitch level. Separate celeste stops are next to their corresponding normally-tuned stops. Reed stops are often labeled in red on stop knobs or tabs.

===Classifications of stops===
Organ pipes fall into five broad categories:
*Principal or Diapason
*:Audio example
*::Principal stops are non-imitative; that is, their sound does not attempt to imitate that of a particular instrument. The Principal sound is the most characteristic sound of the pipe organ; it is the sound which comes to mind in the context of traditional church music (such as hymns). While spellings and names vary by language and era, here are some common examples:
**Principal (or Diapason, Open Diapason, , )
**Octave (or Prestant)
**Super Octave (or Fifteenth, )
**Quint (or Twelfth; sometimes in the Flute category)
**Mixture (or , , , ; followed by a Roman numeral indicating the number of pipes that play simultaneously for a single note; example: Mixture III, or Fourniture IV–VI)
*Flute
*:Audio example
*::Flute stops attempt to imitate (to one degree or another) the sound of flute-class woodwind instruments, such as the transverse flute and piccolo. Common examples:
**Flute (or , )
** (or )
** (or )
**Subbass (or )
**Stopped Diapason (or Stopped Flute) — despite its name, the Stopped Diapason is a flute-class stop
** (or Harmonic Flute, )
**Concert Flute (or )
**Piccolo
** (or Chimney Flute, )
** (or )
**Quintaton (or )
**Nazard (or , )
** (or )
*String
*:Audio example
*::String stops attempt to imitate (to one degree or another) the sound of stringed instruments, such as the violin and cello. Common examples:
**Gamba (or Viola da Gamba, )
**Violin (or Viola, )
**Violoncello
**Violone
*Reed
*:Audio example
*::Reed stops attempt to imitate (to one degree or another) the sound of brass instruments such as the trumpet and tuba, reed instruments such as the clarinet and oboe, and even the human voice. Common examples:
**Trumpet (or , , Clarion, )
** (or Trombone)
**Oboe (or )
** (or ) 
**Clarinet
**Tuba
** (or )
**Vox Humana (or )
**Cornopean
**Ophicleide
*Hybrid 
*:Audio example of Gemshorn (flute + string)
*::Hybrid stops contain one rank of pipes which attempts to combine the tone qualities of two other classifications of stops, such as Principal + String, String + Flute, or Principal + Flute. Common examples:
**Combination of String + Principal:
***Geigen Principal (or Violin Diapason)
***Salicional
***Dulciana
**Combination of String + Flute
***Gemshorn
***

Percussion stops (often referred to as &quot;toy counters&quot; or &quot;toy stops&quot;), unlike other organ stops, are not aerophones, but actual embedded percussion instruments (although they may still be actuated by the wind supplies of an organ). Both tuned and untuned percussion stops exist (for instance, marimba and snare drum, respectively). They are commonly designed to imitate orchestral or band instruments, or to imitate non-musical sounds (for instance, thunder), or to produce unique sounds (for instance, zimbelstern). Percussion stops are particularly common in theatre organs, which were generally made to accompany silent films.

==Notable examples==
*The loudest organ stop in the world is the Grand Ophicleide located in the Right Pedal division of the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ. It stands on 100” wind pressure and is described by Guinness World Records as having &quot;a pure trumpet note of ear-splitting volume, more than six times the volume of the loudest locomotive whistle.&quot; A former organ curator warned the stagehands when the Grand Ophicleide was going to be used, because of the volume.
*The mixture stop with the largest numbers of pipes, called Ple, can be found in Santanyí (Majorca), Spain. It has 22 ranks in the left hand and 25 in the right.
*There are only two true and complete (acoustic, non-digital, going down to C−1) 64′ stops in the world: the Contra-Trombone 64′ in the Sydney Town Hall Grand Organ (click here for a sound sample), and the Diaphone-Dulzian 64′ in the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ (click here for a sound sample). The lowest note of these stops has a frequency of 8 Hz. Because of the limitations of most loudspeakers and the limitations of human hearing, the listener will not be able to hear the lowest frequencies in the sample, but may &quot;feel&quot; them and hear the harmonics above them.
*Many large organs have a 64′ stop in their stoplist, but nearly all of these are either digital, acoustic imitations (32′ combined with a ′ extension creating a 64′ resultant impression), upper pipes in the octave, or else a sound sample of a higher-pitched stop electronically altered to sound one or more octaves lower. The Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ is capable of creating a resultant 128′ stop by combining its 64′ and ′ stops.

==Other types of stops==
*Vogelgesang (also known as rosignolo), is a bird-imitating organ stop.

<text>Cindy &amp; The Saffrons was a UK vocal group, comprising Joanne Whalley as &quot;Cindy&quot; and Lindsay Neil and Sally Stairs as The Saffrons.

In 1982 at Abbey Road Studios, they recorded a cover of the Shangri-Las&#x27; song &quot;Past, Present and Future&quot;. It peaked at #56 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1983. The same year their version of &quot;Terry&quot;, originally by Twinkle, was released. The group split up soon thereafter, and Whalley concentrated on her career as an actress.

<text>Universities in [[Greece]] form one part of constitutionally-recognized institutions with degree awarding powers. According to Greece&#x27;s Constitution, higher education institutions (HEIs) include universities, polytechnics, some specialist HEIs, and formerly technological educational institutes (TEIs). In Greece, universities are private and public-owned and funded having state-accredited university title and authorization of university degree awarding powers at level 6 (first cycle qualification, bachelor&#x27;s level) under the Bologna Process and the National Qualification Framework of Greece which is officially named Hellenic Qualification Framework (HQF; Greek: ).

The State University System of Greece operates on the term system of two semesters per academic year, has the national curriculum (national education system) set forth by the Ministry of Education of Greece ().

==Higher education institutions==
Public Higher Education Institutions&#x27; (HEIs; Greek: ) undergraduate programmes in Greece are government funded and have free education without any payment of tuition fee. About one-fourth of postgraduate programmes are offered without tuition and 30% of students can be entitled to attend tuition-free postgraduate programmes after they are assessed on individual criteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4485/2017 Government Gazette 114/Α/4-8-2017&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hellenic Qualification Framework (HQF) sets out the different levels of education qualifications and the requirements for each of these and is linked to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), and thus to other qualifications frameworks across the European Union.
The regulated framework for Greece higher education qualifications, which is tied to the HQF, covers degree-levels qualifications of Greece degree-awarding bodies and is linked to the Qualifications Framework in the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA) established by the Bologna process where Greece is a full member since 1999. Joining to the Bologna process Greece began education reforms in order to get higher education meeting the common European Union standards. Now the process is implemented in all higher education institutions. The programmes of EHEA are set at three levels of study which are usually referred to as the three cycle system.

First (entry level), a four-year cycle of study at EQF level 6 to attain a bachelor&#x27;s degree or its equivalent (Greek: ; transliterated to Ptychio in dhimotiki from 1976–present; or defunct ; Ptychion in polytonic, katharevousa up until 1976). A second cycle of study follows at EQF level 7 lasting one or two years to attain a master&#x27;s degree (, also known as: δίπλωμα μεταπτυχιακών σπουδών (Δ.Μ.Σ.), &#x27;diploma of postgraduate studies&#x27;) or equivalent, which is distinguished from a postgraduate diploma, typically having 120 ECTS, as opposed to a full master&#x27;s degree which usually has 180. The third cycle of study at EQF level 8, lasting three years, awards a doctoral degree () or equivalent.

With the law 5094/2024, Government Gazette 39/A/13-3-2024, the establishment and operation of private (&quot;non-state&quot;)Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) was permitted. A fully-recognized private Higher Education Institution must obtain a Higher Education Accreditation by the National (Hellenic) Authority for Higher Education (HAHE) and an official establishment and operating license by the Greek Ministry of Education. Such HEIs are yet to be accredited and established. 

The Open Courses are undergraduate and graduate courses taught in Greek Public Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) that are free of cost, freely accessible and freely available to any person over the Internet (online). It operated by the Greek Academic Network (GUnet), also known as Greek Universities Network (GUnet), a member of the Open Education Global (OE Global).

With the paragraph 10 of article 34 of the Law 2725/15-6-1999, Government Gazette 121/A/17-6-1999, high school graduate athletes from 17 to 30-year-old who hold specific sport achievements are admitted without entrance Panhellenic Examinations to anyone of their choice undergraduate department of the public Higher Education Institutions of Greece. 

==Universities and technical universities==
Universities () can grant one or more of bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, integrated master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. The undergraduate programme of study for most disciplines is four years with awarded qualification in line with the Bologna process legal equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, 240 ECTS, at level 6 of Greece&#x27;s National Qualification Framework (NQF), European Qualifications Framework (EQF), or International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).

Technical universities, also known as polytechnics (Greek: ), grant degrees at the integrated master&#x27;s level (which is divided into a 3-year undergraduate degree qualification and a 2-year postgraduate one), master&#x27;s, and doctorate level. In specific disciplines, only the undergraduate programme is five years with awarded qualification (Greek: &quot;&quot;, Latinised version: Diploma) that is legally equivalent to an integrated master&#x27;s degree, which is often the standard route to chartered status for a regulated profession in Greece. The integrated master&#x27;s degree is a specialized degree corresponding to a master-level degree which has integrated part of an undergraduate degree. It is also called an undergraduate master&#x27;s degree, where instead of studying for two separate degrees, a student will study for a single, longer programme. A student can also be awarded the 3-year undergraduate qualification (180 ECTS), instead of pursuing the masters should he wishes to. The most common integrated master&#x27;s is in engineering, for example a Dipl.-Eng or Dip.Arch.Eng/M.Arch, and also others along with some programmes in the fine arts.

In medical schools, six years of studying are required to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

In addition to earning an academic degree in specific disciplines only, state license is required to practice independently within the country of Greece, and some disciplines have further licensing requirements to bestow a recognized appellation (chartered accountant, attorney at law, doctor of medicine, etc.). Diploma is a prerequisite for registration as a chartered professional, so it is also known as professional degree. The use of specific professional titles for some professions is legally regulated. For a regulated profession, access to professional practice requires holding a particular specific degree (e.g. professional degree), taken special exams that are required to earn state practice credential such as it must pass the National Council Licensure Examination, a period of practical training under supervision similar to internship, and/or registration with a professional body.

==International programmes== 
With the law 4692/2020, Part II, Chapter III, from Article 82 to Article 95, the Greek Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can provide first cycle programmes of studies in a language other than Greek. 
Among the Greek universities offer English-taught full-time programmes with tuition are: 
* National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 4-year undergraduate programme in Archaeology, History, and Literature of Ancient Greece. 
* National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine 6-year undergraduate programme.
* Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, School of Medicine 6-year undergraduate programme for international students. 
* University of Thessaly, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Degree 6-year undergraduate programme.
* University of Crete, School of Medicine 6-year undergraduate programme for international students. 
* International Hellenic University, University Center of International Programmes of Studies (UCIPS), offers English-taught postgraduate programmes.
* University of Macedonia, School of Business Administration, Department of Accounting and Finance, 4-year undergraduate programme in Accounting and Finance.

== Non-HEIs ==
After the law 5094/13-3-2024 published on Government Gazette 39/A/13-3-2024 permits in Greece the establishment and operation of private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Before the law 5094/13-3-2024 it was prohibited the operation of private Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). 

In Greece, there are also the private colleges which are not considered universities and are not recognized as HEIs or degree-awarding bodies by the Greek government. The Post-secondary Education Centres (Greek: ) accredited by the Ministry of Education to which the Private Colleges belong, also they can be called Post-secondary Colleges (non-tertiary), they are bodies of non-typical education (&quot;&quot;) known as non-formal education bodies. 
According to the State Constitution of Greece, &quot;education at university level must be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed public law legal bodies&quot;.
This prohibits private companies from operating post-secondary education that provides studies at Level 6 and higher on the Greek Qualifications Framework. However, it does not prohibit colleges from collaborating in Greece with foreign universities to offer undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.

The Panhellenic Association of Recognised Colleges (Greek: ) is the representative body for the Greece located recognised private colleges. All the private colleges located in Greece are for-profit. Generally, any individual who wants to found a college in Greece must obtain a Higher Education Accreditation by the National (Hellenic) Authority for Higher Education (HAHE) and a license by the Ministry of Education, but has no obligation to become a participatory member of HCA.
The vast majority of colleges are offering programmes of study under franchise or validation agreements with universities established in other European Union countries, primarily in the UK, leading to degrees which are awarded directly by those universities. The monitoring of those agreements as well as of additional provisions for the operation of colleges is carried out by the Ministry of Education and confirmed by Parliament by a 2008 law. Amendments were passed in 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 3848/2010 Government Gazette 71/A/19-5-2010&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 2012,&lt;ref name=&quot;Law 4093/2012 Government Gazette 222/A/12-11-2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 2013, and 2014. They are also monitored by the respective educational authorities of the countries of the partnered universities, for example QAA and NARIC for a British university.

One example of a college which neither operating as a franchise nor was validated through arrangements in the UK was the University of Indianapolis – Athens Campus, which ceased operations in July 2014. By contrast, this college was wholly owned and operated by its home campus, and is therefore accredited by the same agency which accredits the home campus. Consequently, students of the University of Indianapolis could switch between campuses at any time.

Degrees, diplomas, certificates, and any other type of attestation awarded by universities in European Union and European Free Trade Association countries to students that have completed their studies in an accredited private college located in Greece, can be recognized as professionally equivalent &quot;in terms of the professional (practice) rights only&quot; (Greek: ) to higher education titles awarded in the formal Greek education system. Recognition of professional equivalence permits access to a specific economic activity that the title-holder can exercise on the same rules, rights, terms as holders of comparable titles of Greece HEIs education system.

Recognition of legally-recognized professional degree rights in Greece can only be granted by the Independent Department of Implementation of European Legislation (ATEEN; ) of the Ministry of Education (Υ.ΠΑΙ.Θ.), as of the 2005 Directive of the European Parliament and Council, implemented domestically by a presidential decree in 2010.

Higher Education qualifications obtained from abroad foreign countries are recognised by the Interdisciplinary Organisation of Recognition Academic Titles and Information (D.O.A.T.A.P.; Greek: ) supervised by the Ministry of Education (). The &quot;Hellenic National Academic Recognition and Information Center (Hellenic NARIC)&quot; is the official international name of DOATAP. In most cases, it can obtain a &quot;statement of comparability&quot; of a qualification (certificate of qualification equivalency information), stating how it compares to the qualifications delivered in Greece.

==HAHE authority==
The Hellenic Quality Assurance and Accreditation Agency for Higher Education (ADIP; Greek: ), established by law 3374/2005, keeps the competent bodies of the state and the HEIs informed on current international developments and relevant issues. The ADIP was reformed by law 4653/2020 to form the Hellenic (National) Authority for Higher Education (HAHE; Greek: ). At the end of each year, a Higher Education Quality Report is submitted to the Minister of Education. A &quot;Quality Assurance Unit&quot; (QAU) is established in every HEI in order to coordinate and support evaluation procedures. QAU meetings are chaired by the Vice-Rector or vice-president of Academic Affairs of the relevant HEI and representatives of the staff and students take part in the QAU.

The internal evaluation is carried out with the responsibility of each academic unit (faculty or department) in cooperation with the Quality Assurance Unit. The academic units appoint Internal Evaluation Groups or Special Evaluation Groups (if undergraduate or postgraduate programmes are separately evaluated) and these groups compile the Internal Evaluation Report and submit it to the Quality Assurance Unit of the institution. The external evaluation process is repeated at longest every four years with the cooperation of HEIs and the HAHE. The evaluation is carried out by the External Evaluation Committee, which consists of five members from an HAHE register of independent experts.

<text>The California chaparral and woodlands is a terrestrial ecoregion of southwestern Oregon, northern, central, and southern California (United States) and northwestern Baja California (Mexico), located on the west coast of North America. It is an ecoregion of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome, and part of the Nearctic realm.

==Setting==

===Three sub-ecoregions===
The California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion is subdivided into three smaller ecoregions.
* California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion: In southern coastal California and northwestern coastal Baja California, as well as all the Channel Islands of California and Guadalupe Island.
* California montane chaparral and woodlands: In southern and central coast adjacent and inland California, covering some of the mountains of: the Coast Ranges; the Transverse Ranges; and the western slopes of the northern Peninsular Ranges.
* California interior chaparral and woodlands: In central interior California surrounding the California Central Valley cover the foothills and the Transverse Ranges and Sierra Nevada.

===Locations===

Most of the population of California and Baja California lives in these ecoregions, which includes the San Francisco Bay Area, Ventura County, the Greater Los Angeles Area, San Diego County, Tijuana, and Ensenada, Baja California.

The California Central Valley grasslands ecoregion, as well as the coniferous Sierra Nevada forests, Northern California coastal forests, and Klamath-Siskiyou forests of northern California and southwestern Oregon, share many plant and animal affinities with the California chaparral and woodlands. Many botanists consider the California chaparral and woodlands, Sierra Nevada forests, Klamath-Siskiyou forests, and Northern California coastal forests as a single California Floristic Province, excluding the deserts of eastern California, which belong to other floristic provinces. Many Bioregionalists, including poet Gary Snyder, identify the central and northern Coast Ranges, Klamath-Siskiyou, the Central Valley, and Sierra Nevada as the Shasta Bioregion or the Alta California Bioregion.
==Flora==
The ecoregion includes a great variety of plant communities, including grasslands, oak savannas and woodlands, chaparral, and coniferous forests, including southern stands of the tall coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;). The flora of this ecoregion also includes tree species such as gray or foothill pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;), scrub oak (&quot;Quercus dumosa&quot;), California buckeye (&quot;Aesculus californica&quot;), the rare Gowen cypress (&quot;Cupressus goveniana)&quot;, the rare Monterey cypress (&quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;), and a wealth of endemic plant species, including the extremely rare San Gabriel Mountain liveforever (&quot;Dudleya densiflora&quot;), Catalina mahogany (&quot;Cercocarpus traskiae&quot;), and the threatened most beautiful jewel-flower (&quot;Streptanthus albidus&quot; ssp. &quot;Peramoenus&quot;). &quot;Hesperoyucca whipplei&quot;, colloquially known as Chaparral Yucca, is commonplace throughout the lower elevations of the climate zone.

There are two types of chaparral: soft and hard chaparral. Hard chaparral is usually evergreen, located at higher elevation and is harder to walk through. Soft chaparral tends to be drought deciduous, live at lower elevations and tends to be easier to walk through.

==Fauna==
Species include the California gnatcatcher (&quot;Polioptila californica&quot;), Costa&#x27;s hummingbird (&quot;Calypte costae&quot;), coast horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma coronatum&quot;), and rosy boa (&quot;Lichanura trivirgata&quot;). Other animals found here are the Heermann kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys heermanni&quot;), Santa Cruz kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys venustus&quot;), and the endangered white-eared pocket mouse (&quot;Perognathus alticolus&quot;).

Another notable insect resident of this ecoregion is the rain beetle (&quot;Pleocoma&quot; sp.) It spends up to several years living underground in a larval stage and emerges only during wet-season rains to mate.

==Fire==
Chaparral, like most Mediterranean shrublands, is highly fire resilient and historically burned with high-severity, stand replacing events every 30 to 100 years. Historically, Native Americans burned chaparral to promote grasslands for textiles and food. Though adapted to infrequent fires, chaparral plant communities can be exterminated by frequent fires especially with climate change induced drought. Today, frequent accidental ignitions can convert chaparral from a native shrubland to nonnative annual grassland and drastically reduce species diversity, especially under global-change-type drought. The historical fire return interval for chaparral communities used to be 30–50 years, but has now decreased to 5–10 years due to human interference.

==Human influence==

The region has been heavily affected by grazing, logging, dams, and water diversions, intensive agriculture and urbanization, as well as competition by numerous introduced or exotic plant and animal species. Some unique plant communities, like southern California&#x27;s Coastal Sage Scrub, have been nearly eradicated by agriculture and urbanization. As a result, the region now has many rare and endangered species, including the California condor (&quot;Gymnogyps californianus&quot;).

<text>A balanced scorecard is a strategy performance management tool – a well-structured report used to keep track of the execution of activities by staff and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.

The term &#x27;balanced scorecard&#x27; primarily refers to a performance management report used by a management team, and typically focused on managing the implementation of a strategy or operational activities. In a 2020 survey 88% of respondents reported using the balanced scorecard for strategy implementation management, and 63% for operational management. Although less common, the balanced scorecard is also used by individuals to track personal performance; only 17% of respondents in the survey reported using balanced scorecards in this way. However it is clear from the same survey that a larger proportion (about 30%) use corporate balanced scorecard elements to inform personal goal setting and incentive calculations.

The critical characteristics that define a balanced scorecard are:
* its focus on the strategic agenda of the organization/coalition concerned;
* a focused set of measurements to monitor performance against objectives;
* a mix of financial and non-financial data items (originally divided into four &quot;perspectives&quot; - Financial, Customer, Internal Process, and Learning &amp; Growth); and,
* a portfolio of initiatives designed to impact performance of the measures/objectives.

== Use ==
The balanced scorecard was initially proposed as a general purpose performance management system. Subsequently, it was promoted specifically as an approach to strategic performance management. The balanced scorecard has more recently become a key component of structured approaches to corporate strategic management.

Two of the ideas that underpin modern balanced scorecard designs concern making it easier to select which data to observe, and ensuring that the choice of data is consistent with the ability of the observer to intervene.

== History ==
Organizations have used systems consisting of a mix of financial and non-financial measures to track progress for quite some time. One such system, the Analog Devices Balanced Scorecard, was created by Art Schneiderman in 1987 at Analog Devices, a mid-sized semi-conductor company. Schneiderman&#x27;s design was similar to what is now recognised as a &quot;First Generation&quot; balanced scorecard design.

In 1990, Schneiderman participated in an unrelated research study led by Robert S. Kaplan in conjunction with US management consultancy Nolan-Norton, and during this study described his work on performance measurement. Subsequently, Kaplan and David P. Norton included anonymous details of this balanced scorecard design in a 1992 article. Although Kaplan and Norton&#x27;s article was not the only paper on the topic published in early 1992, it was a popular success, and was quickly followed by a second in 1993. In 1996, the two authors published &quot;The Balanced Scorecard&quot;. These articles and the first book spread knowledge of the concept of balanced scorecards, leading to Kaplan and Norton being seen as the creators of the concept.

While the &quot;corporate scorecard&quot; terminology was coined by Schneiderman, the roots of performance management as an activity run deep in management literature and practice. Management historians such as Alfred Chandler suggest the origins of performance management can be seen in the emergence of the complex organization – most notably during the 19th century in the US. Other influences may include the pioneering work of General Electric on performance measurement reporting in the 1950s and the work of French process engineers (who created the &quot;tableau de bord&quot; – literally, a &quot;dashboard&quot; of performance measures) in the early part of the 20th century. The tool also draws strongly on the ideas of the &#x27;resource based view of the firm&#x27; proposed by Edith Penrose. None of these influences is explicitly linked to in the original descriptions of balanced scorecard by Schneiderman, Maisel, or Kaplan &amp; Norton.

Kaplan and Norton&#x27;s first book remains their most popular. The book reflects the earliest incarnations of balanced scorecards – effectively restating the concept as described in the second Harvard Business Review article. Their second book, &quot;The Strategy Focused Organization&quot;, echoed work by others (particularly a book published the year before by Olve et al. in Scandinavia) on the value of visually documenting the links between measures by proposing the &quot;Strategic Linkage Model&quot; or strategy map.

As the title of Kaplan and Norton&#x27;s second book highlights, even by 2000 the focus of attention among thought-leaders was moving from the design of balanced scorecards themselves, towards the use of the balanced scorecard as a focal point within a more comprehensive strategic management system. Subsequent writing on the balanced scorecard by Kaplan &amp; Norton has focused on its uses, rather than its design (e.g. &quot;The Execution Premium&quot; in 2008, &quot;Intelligent Design of Inclusive Growth Strategies&quot; in 2019); many others also continue to refine the device itself (e.g. Abernethy et al.).

== Characteristics ==
The characteristic feature of the balanced scorecard and its derivatives is the presentation of a mixture of financial and non-financial measures each compared to a &#x27;target&#x27; value within a single concise report. The report is not meant to be a replacement for traditional financial or operational reports but a succinct summary that captures the information most relevant to those reading it. It is the method by which this &#x27;most relevant&#x27; information is determined (i.e., the design processes used to select the content) that most differentiates the various versions of the tool in circulation. The balanced scorecard indirectly also provides a useful insight into an organization&#x27;s strategy – by requiring general strategic statements (e.g. mission, vision) to be precipitated into more specific/tangible forms.

The first versions of Kaplan and Norton&#x27;s interpretation of the balanced scorecard asserted that relevance should derive from the corporate strategy, and proposed design methods that focused on choosing measures and targets associated with the main activities required to implement the strategy. As the initial audience for this were the readers of the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot;, the proposal was translated into a form that made sense to a typical reader of that journal – managers of US commercial businesses. Accordingly, initial designs were encouraged to measure three categories of non-financial measure in addition to financial outputs – those of &quot;customer,&quot; &quot;internal business processes&quot; and &quot;learning and growth.&quot; These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organizations, or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative &#x27;perspectives&#x27; that might have more relevance to these groups (e.g. Butler et al. (1997), Ahn (2001), Elefalke (2001), Brignall (2002), Irwin (2002), Radnor et al. (2003)).

Modern balanced scorecards have evolved since the initial ideas proposed in the late 1980s and early 1990s and are significantly improved – being both more flexible (to suit a wider range of organizational types) and more effective (as design methods have evolved to make them easier to design, and use).

== Variants ==
Since the balanced scorecard was popularized in the early 1990s, a large number of alternatives to the original &#x27;four box&#x27; balanced scorecard promoted by Kaplan and Norton in their various articles and books have emerged. Most have very limited application, and are typically proposed either by academics as vehicles for expanding the dialogue beyond the financial bottom line – e.g. Brignall (2002) or consultants as an attempt at differentiation to promote sales of books and / or consultancy (e.g. Neely et al. (2002), Bourne (2002), Niven (2002)).

Many of the structural variations proposed are broadly similar, and a research paper published in 2004 attempted to identify a pattern in these alternatives – noting three distinct types of variation. The variations appeared to be part of an evolution of the balanced scorecard concept, and so the paper refers to these distinct types as &quot;generations&quot;. Broadly, the original &#x27;measures in four boxes&#x27; type design (as initially proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton) constitutes the 1st generation balanced scorecard design; balanced scorecard designs that include a &#x27;strategy map&#x27; or &#x27;strategic linkage model&#x27; (e.g. the Performance Prism, later Kaplan &amp; Norton designs, and the Performance Driver model of Olve, Roy &amp; Wetter (first published in Swedish, 1997; English translation, 1999,) constitute the 2nd Generation of Balanced Scorecard designs; and designs that augment the strategy map / strategic linkage model with a separate document describing the long-term outcomes sought from the strategy (the &quot;destination statement&quot; idea) comprise the 3rd generation balanced scorecard design.

Variants that feature adaptations of the structure of the balanced scorecard to suit better a particular viewpoint or agenda are numerous. Examples of the focus of such adaptations include the triple bottom line, decision support, public sector management, and health care management. The performance management elements of the UN&#x27;s Results Based Management system have strong design and structural similarities to those used in the 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard design approach.

The balanced scorecard is also linked to quality management tools and activities. Although there are clear areas of cross-over and association, the two sets of tools are complementary rather than duplicative.

The balanced scorecard is also used to support the payments of incentives, even though it was not designed for this purpose and is not particularly suited to it.

== Design ==
Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance &#x27;meets expectations&#x27;. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.

The original thinking behind a balanced scorecard was for it to be focused on information relating to the implementation of a strategy, and over time there has been a blurring of the boundaries between conventional strategic planning and control activities and those required to design a balanced scorecard. This is illustrated by the four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan &amp; Norton&#x27;s writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

# Translating the vision into operational goals;
# Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance;
# Business planning; index setting
# Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.

These steps go beyond the simple task of identifying a small number of financial and non-financial measures, but illustrate the requirement for whatever design process is used to fit within broader thinking about how the resulting balanced scorecard will integrate with the wider business management process.

Although it helps focus managers&#x27; attention on strategic issues and the management of the implementation of strategy, it is important to remember that the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy. In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with strategic planning systems and other tools.

=== First generation ===

The first generation of balanced scorecard designs used a &quot;four perspective&quot; approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy. The original four &quot;perspectives&quot; proposed were:
* Financial: encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures. In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question &quot;How do we look to shareholders?&quot;. Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.
* Customer: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question &quot;What is important to our customers and stakeholders?&quot;. Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customers’ purchases, ranking by important customers.
* Internal business processes: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question &quot;What must we excel at?&quot;. Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions.
* Learning and growth: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question &quot;How can we continue to improve, create value and innovate?&quot;. Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition.

The idea was that managers used these perspective headings to prompt the selection of a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organization&#x27;s strategic performance. The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organizations in their initial design. These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organizations, or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative &#x27;perspectives&#x27; that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al. (1997), Ahn (2001), Elefalke (2001), Brignall (2002), Irwin (2002), Flamholtz (2003), Radnor et al. (2003)).

These suggestions were notably triggered by a recognition that different but equivalent headings would yield alternative sets of measures, and this represents the major design challenge faced with this type of balanced scorecard design: justifying the choice of measures made. &quot;Of all the measures you could have chosen, why did you choose these?&quot; These issues contribute to dis-satisfaction with early balanced scorecard designs, since if users are not confident that the measures within the balanced scorecard are well chosen, they will have less confidence in the information it provides.

Although less common, these early-style balanced scorecards are still designed and used today.

In short, first generation balanced scorecards are hard to design in a way that builds confidence that they are well designed. Because of this, many are abandoned soon after completion.

=== Second generation ===

In the mid-1990s, an improved design method emerged. In the new method, measures are selected based on a set of &quot;strategic objectives&quot; plotted on a &quot;strategic linkage model&quot; or &quot;strategy map&quot;. With this modified approach, the strategic objectives are distributed across the four measurement perspectives, so as to &quot;connect the dots&quot; to form a visual presentation of strategy and measures.

In this modified version of balanced scorecard design, managers select a few strategic objectives within each of the perspectives, and then define the cause-effect chain among these objectives by drawing links between them to create a &quot;strategic linkage model&quot;. A balanced scorecard of strategic performance measures is then derived directly by selecting one or two measures for each strategic objective. This type of approach provides greater contextual justification for the measures chosen, and is generally easier for managers to work through. This style of balanced scorecard has been commonly used since 1996 or so: it is significantly different in approach to the methods originally proposed, and so can be thought of as representing the &quot;2nd generation&quot; of design approach adopted for the balanced scorecard since its introduction.

=== Third generation ===

In the late 1990s, the design approach had evolved yet again. One problem with the &quot;second generation&quot; design approach described above was that the plotting of causal links amongst twenty or so medium-term strategic goals was still a relatively abstract activity. In practice it ignored the fact that opportunities to intervene to influence strategic goals are (and need to be) anchored in current and real management activity. Secondly, the need to &quot;roll forward&quot; and test the impact of these goals necessitated the reference to an additional design instrument: a statement of what &quot;strategic success&quot;, or the &quot;strategic end-state&quot;, looked like (which in turn would be related to the organization&#x27;s Mission or Vision Statement). This reference point was called a Destination Statement. It was quickly realized that if a Destination Statement was created at the beginning of the design process then it became easier to select the appropriate strategic activity and outcome objectives which if achieved would deliver it. Measures and targets could then be selected to track the achievement of these objectives. Design methods that incorporate a Destination Statement or equivalent (e.g. the results-based management method proposed by the UN in 2002) represent a tangibly different design approach to those that went before and so have been proposed as representing a &quot;third generation&quot; design method for balanced scorecards.

Design methods for balanced scorecards continue to evolve and adapt to reflect the deficiencies in the currently used methods, and the particular needs of communities of interest (e.g. NGOs and government departments have found the third generation methods embedded in results-based management more useful than first or second generation design methods).

Third generation balanced scorecards improved the utility of second generation of balanced scorecards, giving more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.

== Popularity ==
In 1997, Kurtzman found that 64 percent of the companies questioned were measuring performance from a number of perspectives in a similar way to the balanced scorecard. Balanced scorecards have been implemented by government agencies, military units, business units and corporations as a whole, non-profit organizations, and schools.

The balanced scorecard has been widely adopted, and consistently has been found to be the most popular performance management framework in a widely respected annual survey (e.g. see results from 2003 and 2013).

Theorists have argued from the earliest days of discussion of balanced scorecard usage that much of the benefit of it comes from the design process itself. Indeed, it is argued that many failures in the early days of the balanced scorecard could be attributed to this problem, in that early balanced scorecards were often designed remotely by consultants – it is suggested that because they were not being involved in the design the managers who were intended to use the device did not trust its design (e.g. it measured the wrong things and used inappropriate targets) and so failed to engage with and use the devices.

== Criticism ==
Academic criticism of the balanced scorecard can be broken into three distinct (but overlapping) areas of concern.

# Lack of rigour: The first kind of criticism focuses on the empirical nature of the framework and the lack of any formal validation of the ideas it is based on in the early articles that introduced the concept. Kaplan and Norton notoriously failed to include any citations of earlier articles in their initial papers on the topic, an absence noted, for example, by Norreklit. Others identified technical flaws in the methods and design of the original balanced scorecard or concerning the lack of validation for the approach – for example Flamholtz observed that no validation was provided for the choice of the &quot;four perspectives&quot; of the 1st Generation design: 
# Lack of an overall score: The second kind of criticism is that the balanced scorecard does not provide an overall score or a unified view of performance with clear recommendations: it is simply a list of metrics that managers have to interpret before deciding upon appropriate interventions (e.g. Jensen 2001). These critics usually include in their criticism suggestions about how an &#x27;unanswered&#x27; question they identify in their commentary could be answered, but typically the unanswered question relate to things outside the scope of balanced scorecard itself (such as developing strategies) (e.g. Brignall)
# Not reflective of all stakeholder needs: The third kind of criticism is that the model fails to fully reflect the needs of stakeholders – putting bias on financial stakeholders over others. Early forms of Balanced Scorecard proposed by Kaplan &amp; Norton were orientated towards the needs of commercial organizations in the USA – where a focus on investment return was appropriate. This focus was maintained through subsequent revisions. Even now over 20 years after they were first proposed, the four most common perspectives in Balanced Scorecard designs mirror the four proposed in the original Kaplan &amp; Norton paper. There have been many studies that suggest other perspectives might better reflect the priorities of organizations – particularly but not exclusively relating to the needs of organizations in the public and non-governmental sectors. For instance, the balanced scorecard does not address important aspects of nonprofit strategy such as social dimensions, human resource elements, political issues and the distinctive nature of competition and collaboration in nonprofit settings. More modern design approaches such as 3rd Generation Balanced Scorecard, the Public Sector Scorecard and the UN&#x27;s Results Based Management methods explicitly consider the interests of wider stakeholder groups and perhaps address this issue in its entirety.

In response to these concerns there have been many studies seeking to provide (retrospective) academic underpinnings for the Balanced Scorecard concept, and to provide case study and validation information for the various design generations.

There are relatively few reliable assessments of the effectiveness of the approaches embodied in the balanced scorecard, but some studies demonstrate a link between the use of balanced scorecards and better decision making or improved financial performance of companies. Broadcast surveys of usage have difficulties in this respect, due to the wide variations in definition of &#x27;what a balanced scorecard is&#x27; (making it hard to work out in a survey if you are comparing like with like). Single organization case studies suffer from the &#x27;lack of a control&#x27; issue common to any study of organizational change – what the organization would have achieved if the change had not been made isn&#x27;t known, so it is difficult to attribute changes observed over time to a single intervention (such as introducing a balanced scorecard). However, such studies as have been done have typically found Balanced Scorecard to be useful.

Consideration has been given to the effect of organization size on balanced scorecard effectiveness:
* For large organizations this work has focused on how to translate aggregate corporate strategies into performance management tools relevant to individual teams / units within the organization.
* In small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the balanced scorecard has been found to be effective, but that focus is required on balancing design complexity and relevance with the availability of resource to do the design work. Others have argued that the balanced scorecard is unsuitable for SMEs for a variety of reasons, including the belief that SMEs lack a long-term strategic focus (Hvolby and Thorstenson (2000), McAdam (2000)) and that SMEs have limited knowledge about performance measurement in general (Rantanen and Holtari 2000) and therefore do not recognise the benefits that might accrue from use of the tool (McAdam 2000; Bourne 2001), but it is also important to note that none of these studies attempts to theorise the reasons behind their negative findings.

== Software tools ==
The balanced scorecard by definition is not a complex thing – typically no more than about 20 measures spread across a mix of financial and non-financial topics, and easily reported manually (on paper, or using simple office software).

The processes of collecting, reporting, and distributing balanced scorecard information can be labor-intensive and prone to procedural problems (for example, getting all relevant people to return the information required by the required date). The simplest mechanism to use is to delegate these activities to an individual, and many balanced scorecards are reported via ad hoc methods based around email, phone calls and office software.

In more complex organizations, where there are multiple balanced scorecards to report and/or a need for co-ordination of results between balanced scorecards (for example, if one level of reports relies on information collected and reported at a lower level) the use of individual reporters is problematic. Where these conditions apply, organizations use balanced scorecard reporting software to automate the production and distribution of these reports.

<text>[[Ontario]] came into being as a province of Canada in 1867 but historians use the term to cover its entire history. This article also covers the history of the territory Ontario now occupies.

For a complete list of the premiers of Ontario, see List of Ontario premiers.

== Prehistory ==
*10,000 BCEEarly Paleolithic peoples lived in the spruce woodlands of Southwestern Ontario with mastodons and mammoths. People living in this period, referred to by archaeologists as Early Paleo-Indians, created and used stone tools.
*8,500 BCELate Paleolithic peoples inhabited the now-boreal pine forests of Southwestern Ontario hunting caribou, Arctic fox and rabbit or hare with darts and spear-throwers made from materials obtained through trade or travel with others at great distances. People living at this time are referred to by archaeologists as Late Paleo-Indians.
*8,000–800 BCEDuring the Archaic Period, the climate warmed further. People living in the deciduous forests of Southwestern Ontario hunted a wide variety of woodland animals. Deer and fish were important to their survival. The caribou had moved north. Larger trade networks were established, extending as far as the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic seaboard. Tools now included: nets, weirs, bows, arrows, and implements made of copper. People also fashioned copper into beads and bracelets.
*900 BCE–1610 ADDuring the Woodland Era, pottery was first created. In the middle years, two distinct cultural groups emerged: Princess Point, and Riviere au Vase.
*600–800 ADOntario Haudenosaunee (Iroquoian) Tradition Princess Point culture began focusing on horticulture—specifically the &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (corn, beans, and squash)—forming a complex matrilineal society. During this same period, the Western Riviere au Vase culture established a patrilineal Anishnaabe (Algonquin) society, continuing to follow a traditional seasonal migratory lifestyle.

== 1762 and earlier ==
*Aboriginal people lived on the land for millennia before European settlers came for means of exploration and colonization.
*Before Europeans traveled to North America, first nations people, mostly Algonquian and Iroquoian, shared the land where Ontario is now located.
* 1610 – Samuel de Champlain begins dispatching to live among the Huron and the western Algonquin. The played a multi-faceted role as interpreters, trade promoters, and explorers, who sought to align indigenous groups with the French.
* 1610–1612 – exploration of what is now southern Ontario by Étienne Brûlé, a .
*1611 – Henry Hudson visits Hudson Bay and claims the region for Great Britain.
*1615 – Samuel de Champlain visits Lake Huron, after which French missionaries establish outposts in the region.
*1616 – Date of an early map of New France, entitled &quot;La Nouvelle France&quot;, which included much of what would become Southern Ontario. The map is attributed to Samuel de Champlain.
*1639
**Summer – Construction begins on Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, intended as a central headquarters for the French mission in Huronia.
**November 1 – The first French mission to the Petun is established.
*1640
**The Iroquois raid the southernmost Petun settlement of Ehwae.
**The Jesuits conduct a &quot;winter mission&quot; to the Neutrals during the winter of 1640–41.
*1642 – In June, the Huron Rock Clan frontier settlement of Contarea is destroyed in a &quot;massive attack&quot; by Iroquois forces.
*1646 – In October, the French reactivate their mission to the Petun, with missionaries taking up residence in Ekarenniondi and Etharita.
*1647 – The Iroquois raid the Petun settlement of Etharita.
*1648 – Iroquois revolt against trespassing French, destroying a Jesuit mission near the site of present-day Midland (see Canadian Martyrs).
*–54 – Iroquois drive the Hurons, Petun and Neutral Nation from their territories. Around the same time, another population movement of the Mississaugas from the north shores of Lake Huron and Manitoulin Island to the Kawartha Lakes and Credit River areas.
*1649
** March 16 – The Iroquois capture the Huron settlements of St. Ignace and St. Louis.
** March 19 – Inhabitants of the Huron town of Ossossané, along with its surrounding villages, flee the Iroquois advance overnight across an ice-covered Georgian Bay to take refuge among the Petun.
** May 1 – Many Huron refugees living amongst the Petun depart with the Jesuit priest Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot to Christian Island.
** December 7 – An Iroquois war party destroys the Petun settlement of Etharita (also known as St. Jean). This had become the southernmost Petun settlement after the abandonment of those to the south of it.
*1668 – Father Marquette founds Sault Ste. Marie, noteworthy as the oldest surviving permanent European settlement in both Ontario and neighbouring Michigan.
*1670 – The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company is granted a British royal charter to conduct the Indian Trade in the 3.9 million square kilometer territory named after Prince Rupert of the Rhine known as Rupert Land. This area includes much of what is now Northern Ontario and represents about 1/3 of the land size of Canada.
*1673–establishment of Cataraqui (modern day Kingston, Ontario).

== Part of Province of Quebec, 1763 to 1790 ==
*1763 – Britain wins the Seven Years&#x27; War and takes full control of the future Ontario
*1768 – Guy Carleton commissioned &quot;Captain General and Governor in Chief&quot; on 12 April 1768. He remains in command at Quebec till 1778.
*1775–1783 American War of Independence
* 1778 – Sir Frederick Haldimand takes command as “Captain General and Governor in Chief&quot; 26 June 1778. He occupied Cataraqui (Kingston, Ont.), reinforced Niagara and Detroit, and strengthened other military outposts against the American threat
*1779—Haldimand sends Captain Dietrich Brehm to strengthen the line of communication between Montreal and Detroit; over 5,000 Indians forced out of New York come to Ft. Niagara for food and shelter; he increases the goods distributed as gifts through the Indian Department from about £10,000 in 1778 to £63,861 in 1782.
*1783 – The Treaty of Paris ends the war; U.S. boundary along the St.Lawrence and Great Lakes
* 1784 – Haldimand purchases lands for exiled Loyalists from the Mississaugas for or £1,180
* 1784 Haldimand sets up 8 new townships for settlement along the upper St Lawrence from the westernmost seigneury to modern Brockville, Ontario, and five more around Cataraqui.
*1784 – About 9,000 United Empire Loyalists are settled in what is now southern Ontario, chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, and along the St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. They are soon followed by many more Americans, some of them not so much ardent loyalists but attracted nonetheless by the availability of cheap, arable land.

:At the same time large numbers of Iroquois loyal to Britain arrive from the United States and are settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario.

:Kingston and Hamilton became important settlements as a result of the influx of Loyalists.
*1786 – Haldimand replaced by Carleton, now Lord Dorchester.
*1788 – On July 24, 1788, Governor General Lord Dorchester proclaims the land area to be divided up into &quot;Lower Canada&quot; with a French legal system and &quot;Upper Canada&quot; with a British legal System, whereby the land districts had been named Lunenburg, Mecklenburg, Nassau and Hesse in honour of the Royal family and the present large Germanic population.
*1788 – The British purchase 250,000 acres (1,000 km2) on which they begin the settlement of York, now Toronto
* Thousands of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) farmers move from Pennsylvania to Upper Canada between the 1780s and the 1830s; they claimed a share of the United Empire Loyalists&#x27; foundational myth, drawing on its themes of loyalty and sacrifice.

== Upper Canada, 1791 to 1840 ==

*1791 – The Constitutional Act of 1791 followed the Dorchester Proclamation of 1788 and thereby creates the first land registry for Quebec Upper Canada and the part of present-day Ontario south of Lake Nipissing plus the current Ontario shoreline of Georgian Bay and Lake Superior, and Lower Canada (the southern part of present-day Quebec). Upper Canada&#x27;s first capital is Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake); in 1797 it is moved to York, now Toronto.

:The population of Upper Canada grows from 6,000 in 1785 to 14,000 in 1790 to 46,000 in 1806. (Lower Canada&#x27;s is about 165,000). The population is rural, and based on subsistence agriculture, with few exports; government spending is a major source of revenue.
*1790s–1840s – Dueling is common among the elite, government officials, lawyers, and to military officers; they used dueling as a form of extralegal justice to assert their superior claims to honour. However, a new ethic was emerging that opposed dueling and rejected the hyper-masculinity embodied by the code of the duelist. This opposition was part of growing opposition to hierarchic dominance by the elite; opponents valued the bourgeois husband and father and separated male honour from physical violence.
*1793 – John Graves Simcoe is appointed as the first governor of Upper Canada. He encourages immigration from the United States, builds roads. Slavery was gradually abolished starting in 1793 by the Act Against Slavery.
*1795 – The Jay Treaty is ratified by which Britain agreed to vacate its Great Lakes forts on U.S. territory. Britain continues to supply the First Nations operating in the United States with arms and ammunition.
*1800 – First European settlement on the site of present-day Ottawa
* 1801 – First ironworks in Upper Canada, located at Furnace Falls near Lyndhurst
*1803 – The North West Company moves its mid-continent headquarters from Grand Portage, Minnesota to Fort William, now part of Thunder Bay to be in Upper Canada.
*1803 – Thomas Talbot retires to his land grant in Western Ontario centred around present day St. Thomas and begins settling it. He eventually becomes responsible for settling 65,000 acres (260 km2). His insistence on the provision and maintenance of good roads, and on reserving land along main roads to productive uses rather than to clergy reserves leads to this region becoming the most prosperous in the province.
*1804 – First European settlement on the site of present-day Waterloo
*1807 – First settlement, Ebytown, on the site of present-day Kitchener
*1809 – The first documented appearance of steam navigation on the Great Lakes is at Prescott, when the steamship &quot;Dalhousie&quot; was launched for service on the Saint Lawrence River.
*1812–1814 – The War of 1812 with the United States. Upper Canada is the chief target of the Americans, since it is weakly defended and populated largely by American immigrants. However, division in the United States over the war, the incompetence of American military commanders, and swift and decisive action by the British commander, Sir Isaac Brock, keep Upper Canada part of British North America.
*1812–1813 – Detroit is captured by the British on August 6, 1812. The Michigan Territory is held under British control until it was abandoned in 1813.
*1813 – The Americans send an army of 10,000 men under General William Henry Harrison to recapture Detroit. British and Tecumseh&#x27;s forces win the first battle at Frenchtown, January 22, 1813, killing 400 Americans and taking 500 prisoners, many of whom are then killed.
* 1813 May – British and Indian forces fail in their siege of Fort Meigs, at the mouth of Maumee river; in August, they are repulsed at Fort Stephenson
*1813 September 10 – At the Battle of Lake Erie, the American Navy, decisively destroys British naval power on Lake Erie. British and Tecumseh forces, with their logistics destroyed, retreat back toward Niagara
*1813 October 5 – At the Battle of the Thames (also called &quot;Battle of Moraviantown&quot;), General Harrison, with 4500 infantry intercepts the retreating British and Indian forces and win a decisive victory. British power in western Ontario is ended, Tecumseh is killed, and his Indian coalition collapses. Americans take control of western Ontario for the remainder of the war, and permanently end the threat of Indian raids into Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan.
*1814 – Population 95,000.
*1815 – War ends and prewar boundaries are reestablished. One of the legacies of the war in Upper Canada is strong feelings of anti-Americanism which persist to this day and form an important component of Canadian nationalism.
*1816 – Waterloo adopts its current name to honour the battle of Waterloo.
*1817 – By the Rush–Bagot Treaty, Britain and the United States agree to keep large war vessels out of the Great Lakes.
*1818 – The Treaty of 1818 reduces boundary and fishing disputes between British North America and the United States.
*1820s–1840 – The &quot;Family Compact&quot; is a closed oligarchy of landowners, royal officials, lawyers, and businessmen who virtually monopolized public office and controlled the economy of the province in the 1820s and 1830s.
*1820 – The Talbot Settlement is now completely settled, having resumed following interruption during the war years.
*1821 – The North West Company merges with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company
*1823 – Peter Robinson settles the Bathurst District near Ottawa with immigrants from Cork County, Ireland.
*1824 – The Church of Scotland is granted a share of the revenues from clergy reserves. Presbyterians by the 1830s were a major force for social conservatism. Ministers sent from Scotland in the 1820s and 1830s were surprised by the ethnic diversity, and horrified at the frontier way of life, which they saw as a devil&#x27;s compound of illiteracy, drunkenness, ignorance of religion, and lack of schools. They promoted conservatism as a means of implanting Scottish moral values.
*1825 – Peter Robinson settles Scott&#x27;s Plains (later renamed Peterborough in his honour).
*1825 – first settlement of Dresden
*1826 – first settlement of London
*1826 – With the creation of the Canada Company, free land is no longer available to immigrants willing to set up homesteads and farms.
*1829 – as a result of the Fugitive slave laws in the United States, the first colony of Black pioneers arrives from Ohio to uncleared land north of London, Ontario. The routes they travelled to Upper Canada become known as the Underground Railroad.
*1831 – Population 236,000.
*1832 – completion of the Rideau Canal from Kingston to Ottawa after six years of construction.
*1832 – a serious cholera outbreak spreads quickly from Lower Canada killing thousands.
*1833 – Building of the first Welland Canal by William Hamilton Merritt
*1837 – Rebellions of 1837 - Upper Canada Rebellion in favour of responsible government; a similar rebellion (the Lower Canada Rebellion) occurred in Quebec. In the world context of Atlantic revolutions, the Canadian reformers took their inspiration from the republicanism of the American Revolution. They demanded right to participate in the political process through the election of representatives; they sought to make the legislative council elective rather than appointed. The British military crushed both rebellions, ending any possibility the two Canadas would become republics.
*1839 – Lord Durham publishes his report on the causes of the rebellions in 1837.
*1840 – The assembly passes a law providing for the sale of the clergy reserves, but it is disallowed by the British government.
*1840 – Upper Canada is now heavily in debt as a result of its heavy investments in canals.

== The United Province of Canada (Canada West), 1841 to 1867 ==
*1841 – Upper and Lower Canada are united by the Act of Union 1840 to form the Province of Canada, as recommended by Durham. Upper Canada becomes known as Canada West and Lower Canada as Canada East.
*1841 – Population 455,000.
*1841 – Sydenham dies in a riding accident and is replaced by Sir Charles Bagot. The movement for responsible government which had been growing under Sydenham is now so strong that Bagot realizes that to govern effectively he must admit French leaders to his executive council. Once admitted, Canada East Reformer Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine insists that Canada West Reformer Robert Baldwin also be admitted. Bagot admits Baldwin as well, creating a Reform bloc.
*1843 – Bagot retires because of illness and is replaced by Sir Charles Metcalfe, who is determined to make no further concessions to the colonists. Metcalfe refuses a demand by Baldwin and Francis Hincks that the assembly approve official appointments. The ministry in the assembly resigns, and in the ensuing election a slim majority supporting Metcalfe is returned.
*1846 – The Colonial Secretary, Lord Grey, rules that the British North American lieutenant governors must rule with the consent of the governed. Executive councils are to be selected from the majority in the assembly, and change when the confidence of the assembly changes. Britain is abandoning the mercantilist principles which have guided its imperial policy, and since colonial trade will no longer be restricted, local colonial politics need no longer be restricted.
*1846 – Britain begins the repeal of preferential tariffs to the colonies, starting with the Corn Laws. These actions essentially spur on the beginning of later negotiated trade agreements with the United States.
*1847 – Canada is overwhelmed with 104,000 immigrants, many suffering from typhus who arrive that year alone escaping the Great Famine of Ireland. 1700 typhus deaths, including doctors, nurses, priests and others who aide the sick. They land at Grosse Île, Canada East and Partridge Island, New Brunswick. Large numbers go on to settle in Canada West. Bytown (Ottawa), Kingston and Toronto receive more than other places, putting a strain on local resources while at the same drastically increasing and changing the composition of the population in the province.
*1848 – Lord Elgin, who had replaced Metcalfe in 1847, asks Baldwin and Lafontaine to form a government following their success in elections for the assembly. This is the Province of Canada&#x27;s first responsible government.
*1849 – Elgin signs the Rebellion Losses Bill, which provided compensation for losses suffered during the Lower Canada Rebellion, over the opposition of English conservatives (Tories) in Canada East, who were accustomed to having the governor support them. In reaction, a Tory mob burns down the parliament building in Montreal but Elgin, supported by majorities in both Canada East and Canada West (which had already passed a similar bill), does not back down, and responsible government is established in fact.
*1849 – The Canada East Tories then sponsor an Annexation Manifesto calling for the province of Canada to join the United States. They were motivated by the loss of trade threatened by the repeal of the British Corn Laws. However, the rest of the Canadian population opposes the manifesto, including the Tories of Canada West, who favour provincial union. Union with the United States ceases to be an important political issue.
*1850 – The Robinson Treaties are negotiated by William Benjamin Robinson with the Ojibwe nation transferring to the Crown the eastern and northern shores of Lake Huron and the northern shore of Lake Superior.
*1851 – The population of Canada West is now 952,000 having more than doubled in 10 years, by then numerically superior to that of Canada East. Politicians of Canada West begin to argue for representation by population (&#x27;rep by pop&#x27;).
*1854 – An agreement for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers is reached between British North America and the United States. The British North American provinces can now send their natural products (principally grain, timber, and fish) to the United States without tariff, while American fishermen are allowed into British North American fisheries. Lake Michigan and the St. Lawrence River are opened to ships of all signatories.
*1854 – A law secularizing the clergy reserves is passed; the Anglican and Presbyterian churches retain their endowments.
*1855 – The American canal at Sault Ste. Marie on the St. Marys River (Michigan–Ontario) opened in May which opened Lake Superior to American and Canadian navigation, and made access to the Red River colony in Manitoba easier.
*1855 – The Great Western Railway links Windsor with Hamilton and Toronto.
*1856 – The Grand Trunk Railway opens between Sarnia and Montreal greatly enhancing the flow of goods and people across Southern Ontario and trade links with the American Midwest. Towns along its route swell in importance and population.
*1858 – Canada has become increasingly sectional, with Canada West electing Clear Grit Liberals and Canada East electing Conservatives. A coalition government led by John A. Macdonald and Antoine-Aimé Dorion falls in two days. In the assembly Alexander Galt proposes a federal union of the British North American colonies as a solution to the problem.
*1858 – The temporary judicial districts of Algoma and Nipissing are created, the first in Northern Ontario.
*1859 – The Clear Grit Liberals under George Brown propose specific arrangements for a federal union of the two Canadas.
*1861 – Population is 1,396,000.
*1864 – A committee proposed by George Brown to inquire into solutions to the parliamentary deadlock between the Canadas recommends a federal union of the British North American colonies, a solution which is welcomed by all sides. A government of Liberals and Conservatives, the Great Coalition, is formed to pursue this goal. Representatives of the coalition attend the Charlottetown Conference called to discuss union of the maritime colonies and persuade the representatives to endorse the Canadian plan for a broader federal union. A conference in Quebec City draws up the Quebec Resolutions, a plan for this union.
*1866 – The Westminster Conference endorses the Quebec Resolutions with minor changes.
*1866 – After a minor skirmish on the Niagara Peninsulia at Ridgeway, the Fenians withdraw back the United States. This incident only hastens the publics desire for full-fledged nationhood (see Fenian raids).

== 1867 to 1985 ==
Canada 1867 and after. The Province of Ontario 1867 and after
*1867 – The parliament of the United Kingdom passes the British North America Act, by which the provinces of United Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia join to form Canada. United Canada was split into Canada East/Est and Canada West/Ouest, the latter of which eventually changed its name to Ontario. The capital of Canada West was the city of York, which later changed its name to Toronto.
*1870 – There is large public support amongst Protestants for the trying of Louis Riel for treason for executing Thomas Scott during the so-called Red River Rebellion in Manitoba, while many Quebecers support Riel. Although Riel&#x27;s government was finally recognized by Canada, its actions are destined to be described as a rebellion ever after. Tensions rise between Quebec and English Canada.
*1870 – the head of construction for the Dawson Road to Manitoba is named Prince Arthur&#x27;s Landing by Colonel Garnet Wolseley during the Red River Rebellion.

*1879 – The federal government of Sir John A. Macdonald, as part of its national Policy, institutes protective tariffs on manufactures and on farm products; the tariffs help Ontario industry but hurt farmers.
*1882 – The Canadian Pacific Railway Thunder Bay to Winnipeg is completed in June by the federal government.
*1883 – Important mineral deposits are found near Sudbury; this and similar discoveries, especially near Cobalt, triggered a mining boom in Northern Ontario. The region acquires a large French-speaking population as Quebeckers move there to work in the boom.

*1889 – The Imperial Parliament confirms Ontario&#x27;s right to Northwestern Ontario west to Lake of the Woods and north of the Albany River by incorporation of sections of the District of Keewatin.
*1890–1896 – Tension between English and French is further aggravated by the disagreement between Ontario and Quebec over the Manitoba Schools Question. Ontario objects to a federal remedial bill to restore French schools in Manitoba in part because of its support for provincial rights, and in part because of the influence of a Protestant Equal rights movement begun in response to pro-Roman Catholic policies instituted in Quebec.
*1893 – A severe economic recession hits dropping the province&#x27;s industrial output. Many in Ontario seek new opportunities further west following the recently completed transcontinental railroad.
*1896 – The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council rules that the federal government may exercise its reserve power only in time of war. This results in an increase in provincial power as areas of provincial responsibility are interpreted more broadly to accommodate new types of government initiative (social welfare, for example).
*1896 – Sir Oliver Mowat resigns after 24 years as premier.
*1906 – Establishment of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario by the government of Sir James P. Whitney at the urging of Sir Adam Beck.
*1912 – Ontario acquires its current territory by incorporation of further sections of the North-West territories

*1943 – George Drew and the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario are elected, beginning 42 years of Conservative government.
*1951 – In response to a civil rights movement which originated in opposition to racial discrimination in Dresden, Ontario, the government of Leslie Frost passes Canada&#x27;s first Fair Employment Practices Act, which forbids discrimination on the basis of race, creed, colour, nationality, ancestry or place of origin. However, the act is enforced administratively, with prosecution only a last resort.
*1951 – The Frost government passes Ontario&#x27;s first equal pay legislation, the Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act.
*1954 – The Frost government introduces Canada&#x27;s first Fair Accommodation Practices Act. Like the Fair Employment Practices Act it is enforced administratively, with prosecution only a last resort.

<doc id="522242" wikidata="Q2443828" url="?curid=522242" title="Solovki prison camp">
<text>The Solovki special camp (later the Solovki special prison), was set up in 1923 on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea as a remote and inaccessible place of detention, primarily intended for socialist opponents of Soviet Russia&#x27;s new Bolshevik regime. 

At first, the Anarchists, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries enjoyed a special status there and were not made to work. Gradually, prisoners from the old regime (priests, gentry, and White Army officers) joined them and the guards and the ordinary criminals worked together to keep the &quot;politicals&quot; in order.

This was the nucleus from which the entire Gulag grew, thanks to its proximity to the first great construction project of the Five-Year Plans, the White Sea–Baltic Canal.

In one way, Solovki and the White Sea Canal broke a basic rule of the Gulag: they were both far too close to the border. This facilitated a number of daring escapes in the 1920s; as war loomed in the late 1930s it led to the closure of the Solovki special prison. Its several thousand inmates were transferred elsewhere, or shot on the mainland and on Solovki.

==The &quot;mother of the Gulag&quot;==

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called Solovki the &quot;mother of the GULAG&quot;.

=== From monastery to concentration camp===

Historically, the Solovetsky Islands were the location of the famous Russian Orthodox Solovetsky Monastery complex. It was a centre of economic activity with over three hundred monks, and also a forepost of Russian naval power in the North, repelling foreign attacks during the Time of Troubles, the Crimean War, and the Russian Civil War. In the autumn of 1922 the process of transitioning from a monastery to concentration camp began.
All wooden buildings were burned, and many of the monks were murdered, including the Igumen. The remaining monks were sent to forced labour camps in central Russia.

The unpublished decree of 3 November 1923 led to the conversion of the monastery buildings into the Solovki &quot;special&quot; camp: the Solovetsky Lager Osobogo Naznachenia or &quot;SLON&quot; in Russian (the acronym is a play on the Russian word for elephant). One of the first &quot;forced labor camps&quot;, Solovki served as a prototype for the Gulag as a whole. In early 1924, it was sometimes given a double name, &quot;Severnye (Solovetskiye) Lagerya OGPU&quot; (Northern (Solovki) camps of OGPU).

Its remote situation made escape almost impossible and in Tsarist times the monastery had been used, on occasion, as a political prison by the Russian imperial administration. The treatment of the prisoners in the Soviet-era camp attracted much criticism in Western Europe and the United States after a book came out in England, &quot;An Island Hell&quot;, by S. A. Malsagoff. After a thorough clean-up and careful staging, the Soviet government sent the proletarian writer Maxim Gorky there in an attempt to counter this negative publicity. He wrote a very favourable essay, which praised the beauty of nature on the islands, but some authors believe he understood the real conditions he was witnessing.

=== The Baltic-White Sea Canal ===

The exact number of prisoners sent to Solovki from 1923 to the closure of its penitentiary facilities in 1939 is unknown. Estimates range between tens and hundreds of thousands.

In 1923, Soloviki contained &quot;no more than 3,000&quot; prisoners; by 1930, the number had jumped to &quot;about 50,000&quot;, with another 30,000 held on the mainland at the nearest railhead of Kem. In the early 1930s, many of the prisoners from the camp were transferred to the newly established Belbaltlag to man the construction of the White Sea – Baltic Canal.

===A Special Prison, 1936–1939===
In 1936, the Solovki camp was renamed a &quot;special&quot; prison (SLON, an acronym that means &quot;Elephant&quot; in Russian) and from then until its closure in 1939 it served as a holding area for many prisoners subsequently executed, there or on the mainland, during the Great Terror of 1937–1938.

Until documents confirming their execution were found in 1996, it was long thought that a transport of over one thousand prisoners, a quota for &quot;1st category arrests&quot; (executions), died from drowning after the barges on which they were travelling were deliberately sunk in the White Sea. It is now known that they were shot on the mainland in late October and early November 1937; subsequent quotas for execution came too late in the year to sail across the White Sea and were shot on the islands, near Sekirnaya Hill.

All but five of the 1,116 prisoners sent from Solovki across the White Sea on 27 October 1937 were executed by NKVD Captain and senior executioner Mikhail Matveyev at Sandarmokh between that date and 10 November 1937, when he reported his task complete. Among those killed were 289 members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, the Executed Renaissance.

A further transport was prepared to sail to the mainland for execution, but it was too late in the year to cross the frozen sea. Instead, between 200 and 300 prisoners were shot on Solovki itself, near the Sekirnaya Hill. One of the many victims was Yelizaveta Katz, an engineer, who was 8 months pregnant. She was due to be shot with the others on 17 February 1938, but was allowed to give birth, then shot three months later on 16 May, aged 28.

In 1939, the prison was closed. It was situated too close to the border with Finland, and the Second World War was imminent. The buildings were transformed into a naval base and a cadet corps was deployed there. (One of its students was the future author Valentin Pikul.)

=== World Heritage and a disputed legacy ===

In 1989, a permanent exhibition, &quot;The Solovki special camp&quot;, was added to the museum on the islands, the first anywhere in the USSR to be devoted to the Gulag. In June of that year, the first Days of Remembrance for Victims of Political Repression were held on the islands; in subsequent years this event would take place in August.

The Orthodox Church reestablished the monastery in 1992, and that year the ensemble was added to UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List.

In 2015, human rights activists expressed disquiet that the authorities were &quot;gradually removing all traces of the labor camp&quot;. In January 2016 the Gulag section in the Solovki Museum was closed by its new director, Vladimir Shutov who, as Archimandrite Porfiry, was head of the monastery.

In August 2017, the local authorities asked police to investigate the 29th annual Days of Remembrance as an &quot;unauthorised&quot; gathering. Early in 2018, a court in the Arkhangelsk Region heard an unsuccessful plea by Archimandrite Porfiry to annul a contract concluded in 2011 with the head of the now disbanded Gulag section of the museum and evict its former head, Olga Bochkaryova, and her daughter from their two-room apartment.

The author of several books about Solovki, Yury Brodsky, was accused by an Orthodox website of displaying &quot;religious hatred&quot; in his latest publication.

== Notable prisoners ==

Members of the intelligentsia, representing both Tsarist Russia and the post-revolutionary USSR, were prominent among the prisoners on Solovki.

===The 1920s===
In the 1920s many of those sent to Solovki were released, but often arrested and imprisoned (or exiled) a second time.

===The First Five-Year Plan, 1928–1932===

Naftaly Frenkel was a prisoner on Solovki who became a leading cadre in the security services during the First Five-Year Plan.

Arrested by the OGPU in 1923, he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment and sent to Solovki. There his sentence was reduced and in 1927, he was released and appointed head of production at SLON before being sent as representative of the camp to Moscow in 1929. Soon he was in charge of production throughout the Gulag and oversaw work on the White Sea Canal. His activities in the Gulag paralleled the forced industrialisation and collectivisation of agriculture throughout the Soviet Union.

The mass shooting on Solovki in 1929 described by Dmitry Sergeyevich Likhachov (it forms a key episode in Marina Goldovskaya&#x27;s 1987 film, &quot;Solovki Power&quot;) was a sign of the harshening regime.

<doc id="522250" wikidata="Q3741378" url="?curid=522250" title="George Creel">
<text>George Edward Creel (December 1, 1876 – October 2, 1953) was an American investigative journalist and writer, a politician and government official. He served as the head of the United States Committee on Public Information, a propaganda organization created by President Woodrow Wilson during World War I.

==Early life and education==
Creel was born on December 1, 1876, in Blackburn, Missouri, to Henry Clay Creel and Virginia Fackler Creel, who had three sons, Wylie, George, and Richard Henry (Hal). His father came to Missouri from Parkersburg, Virginia, and bought land in Osage County, Missouri; he was college educated, and served in Virginia legislature. A captain of the Confederate States Army during the Civil War, he did not succeed in the Missouri post-war economy as a farmer and rancher and became an alcoholic. Virginia provided for the family by keeping a boarding house in Kansas City and by sewing and keeping a large garden in Odessa, Missouri. All her children became productive members of society: Wylie Creel, a businessman; George, a journalist and writer; and Richard, a doctor, who served as Assistant Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service.

His alcoholic father did not leave as deep an impression on Creel as did his mother, who inspired his passion for women&#x27;s suffrage. The family moved frequently around west-central Missouri in Creel&#x27;s early years, living for a time in Wheatland, Hickory County, Missouri, then Kansas City before finally settling in Odessa, Missouri, in 1888. He often said that, &quot;I knew my mother had more character, brains, and competence than any man that ever lived.&quot; His mother also encouraged his love for literature. Although Creel did not receive much formal education, as his mother pulled him out of school system, and was mainly home-schooled, he credited his mother for his fair knowledge of history and literature including classics, such as the &quot;Iliad&quot;. In 1891, the then fifteen-year-old Creel ran away from home for a year, supporting himself by working at a succession of county fairs across Missouri and at odd jobs when available. Despite his resistance and rebellion, Creel did manage to receive some formal schooling, while attending Kansas City Central High School, Odessa High School, and Odessa College for one year in Odessa, Missouri. He said of himself that &quot;an open mind is not part of my inheritance. I took in prejudices with mother&#x27;s milk and was weaned on partisanship.&quot;

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1896, he began his first formal job at the &quot;Kansas City World.&quot; He was hired for $4 a week, starting as a reporter, but eventually moved up to write feature articles. He also wrote a book review column and covered social happenings. He was eventually fired because he felt it was wrong to discuss a wealthy man&#x27;s daughter eloping with her coachman in the paper and apparently his editors didn&#x27;t agree.

After his termination, he was given a free train pass to Chicago by a well-wisher, and then hopped a cattle train to New York earning his fare by tending stock. He found an opportunity to work as a free-lance joke writer for William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s comic supplements. As a 1913 &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; profile put it, he was &quot;shutting himself in his cheap room in a mechanics&#x27; hotel; he ground out jokes by the dozens, by the hundreds, jokes in bales and jokes in bundles.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t sell any his first month and survived by shoveling snow. Soon, he sold four jokes to Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Evening Journal&quot; and became a regular with many periodicals.

On March 11, 1899, he went back to Kansas City with his friend, Arthur Grissom, a poet, who married into rich Kansas family, to start a newspaper, &quot;The Independent.&quot; After only ten months, however, Grissom withdrew from the partnership. At age 23, Creel became the sole owner, editor, and publisher of &quot;The Independent&quot;. In the paper he dealt with many social issues including women&#x27;s suffrage, single tax system, and public ownership of utilities. He was also a strong supporter of the Democratic Party and aggressively fought the policies and practices of Thomas Pendergast. Creel was not afraid to put politics or party affiliation aside for the greater public good, however. He backed Democrat Joseph W. Folk in a successful run for Missouri Governor in 1904. Then, in 1908, Creel came out in support of Republican Herbert S. Hadley and his gubernatorial campaign. Hadley, an ardent reformer like Folk before him, was the first Republican elected Governor of Missouri in nearly forty years. Said Creel in one of his newspaper editorials regarding party affiliations, &quot;When a man becomes so besotted with partisan prejudice as to exalt party above the interest of the community, state or county, that moment he ceases to be a good citizen.&quot;

In late 1909, Creel left Kansas City and the &quot;Independent&quot; behind for a new political battlefield in Colorado. Reformer John F. Shafroth, a native of Fayette, Missouri, and an acquaintance of Creel&#x27;s, had been elected Colorado&#x27;s governor in 1908. Despite the &quot;Independent&quot; being profitable, he chose to give the newspaper away to a pair of young women who aspired to be newspaper publishers. Leaving Kansas City with just fifty dollars to his name, Creel soon found employment as an editorial writer for the &quot;Denver Post&quot;. He gained national publicity by calling for the lynching of 11 senators who opposed the public ownership of Denver&#x27;s water company. He resigned promptly after and had a brief stint working at William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;. He moved on to write editorials for &quot;The Rocky Mountain News&quot; (1911–1912) where he was a strong supporter of Woodrow Wilson.

In June 1912, Creel was appointed Police Commissioner of Denver by the recently elected reform mayor, Henry J. Arnold. Creel immediately used the office to launch several ambitious reform campaigns, such as ordering police officers to give up their clubs and nightsticks, as well as a campaign to destroy the red-light district in downtown Denver, while providing a tax-funded rehabilitation farm for women leaving prostitution. His time as police commissioner ended after he began pushing the Mayor Henry Arnold to live up to campaign promises. Although he was dismissed by the mayor for the creation of dissension, he was lauded nationally for his watchdog efforts.

Then in 1916, he became heavily involved in President Wilson&#x27;s re-election campaign. Working under Bob Wooley, the Publicity Head for the Democratic National Committee, Creel wrote newspaper features and interviewed various people. In March 1917, Creel discovered that many of the military leaders wanted strong censorship of any criticism of the war. Creel sent President Wilson a brief in which he argued for &quot;expression, not suppression&quot; of the press. Wilson approved Creel&#x27;s proposal and appointed him as chairman of the Committee on Public Information.

===Committee on Public Information===

Seven days after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Woodrow Wilson created the Committee on Public Information, a propaganda agency acting to release government news, to sustain morale in the US, to administer voluntary press censorship, and to develop propaganda abroad. George Creel was named the head of the committee, and he created 37 distinct divisions, most notably the Division of Pictorial Publicity, the Four Minute Men Division, the News Division, and the Censorship Board.

The Division of Pictorial Publicity was staffed by hundreds of the nation&#x27;s most talented artists, and they created over 1000 designs for paintings, posters, cartoons, and sculptures that instilled patriotism, fear, and interest in the war efforts. Creel himself said that the images were &quot;something that caught even the most indifferent eye.&quot; Through the Four Minute Men division, roughly 75,000 civilian volunteers spoke to 314 million people over the span of 18 months on topics assigned by the CPI, like the draft, rationing, bond drives, and victory gardens. These civilian volunteers spoke at social events in places like movie theaters and fellowship halls for four minutes, which was the time it took to change a movie reel and the time believed to be a human&#x27;s attention span. The guidelines set forth by Creel directed the volunteers to fill their speeches with facts and appeals to emotions to bolster public support for the war efforts. Between the News Division and Censorship Committee, Creel and the CPI were able to control the flow of official war information. Creel sought to portray facts without bias, though most pieces of news were &quot;colored by nationalistic assumptions.&quot; Creel&#x27;s committee may have produced biased news, but it was his hope that the US could avoid rigid censorship during the war, as Creel&#x27;s views on censorship were &quot;expression, not repression.&quot; Under Creel&#x27;s direction, the CPI sought only to repress material that contained &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;unfavorable&quot; ideas to avoid demoralizing the population.

All activities of the CPI ceased on November 11, 1918, upon the signing of the Armistice with Germany. The efforts of the CPI were regarded as the greatest public relations effort in history, up to its time. Such a massive, offensive, and multifaceted campaign had never been undertaken before, and the CPI brought to light the power of mass persuasion and social influence at a national level – realizations that had a profound effect on the field of public relations. Many of the 20th century&#x27;s most influential public relations practitioners were trained under Creel on the committee, including Edward Bernays and Carl R. Byoir.

According to historian David F. Trask, all of Creel&#x27;s strengths proved useful at CPI, especially &quot;his predilection for Wilsonian reform abroad as well as at home, his personal magnetism, his taste for controversy, his tendency to attribute evil rather than misjudgment to those who criticized him.&quot;
Trask continues:
:As an administrator Creel was extraordinarily energetic, quick to make decisions, often impulsive. He was capable of inspiring strong devotion...Wilson seems to have held Creel in high regard, probably because of his unbending personal loyalty to the president as well as his effective methods of purveying administrative dogma.

===Post-war career===

After his prolific career as the chairman of the CPI, Creel joined &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine as a feature writer, until he retired in the late 1940s. In 1926, he moved to San Francisco and eventually chaired the Regional Labor Board (1933) for California, Utah, and Nevada.

He was an active member of the Democratic Party and ran against the left-wing novelist Upton Sinclair in the 1934 California gubernatorial election. Sinclair defeated Creel in the Democratic primary, but lost in the general election.

==Personal life==
Creel was married to actress Blanche Bates from 1912 until her death in 1941. The couple had two children, a son named George Jr. and a daughter named Frances. In 1943, he married Alice May Rosseter. During the last years of his life Creel resided in San Francisco until he died on October 2, 1953, at age 76. He was buried in his family plot at Mount Washington Cemetery in Independence, Missouri.

==Works==
Creel was the author of an extensive collection of writings. Some of his writing and books include:

<text>The following is a timeline relating to the Second Italo–Ethiopian War to the end of 1936. A number of related political and military events followed until 1942, but these have been omitted.

==1930==
* Italy builds a fort at Walwal, an oasis in the Ogaden, as part of their gradual encroachment into what had been generally considered Ethiopian territory.

==1934==
* September 29: Italy and Ethiopia release a joint statement refuting any aggression between each other.
* November 23: An Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission discovers the Italian force at Walwal. British members of the delegation soon retire to avoid an international incident.
* December 5: Tensions result in a border clash at Walwal.
* December 6: Abyssinia protests Italian aggression at Walwal.
* December 8: Italy demands apology for Walwal incident.

==1935==
* January 3: Ethiopia appeals to the League of Nations for arbitration into the Walwal incident.
* January 7: On Pierre Laval&#x27;s visit to Rome, the French and Italians sign a pact which, among other conditions, allows Italy a free hand in dealing with Ethiopia in exchange for Italian support against German aggression. 
* February 23: Benito Mussolini sends Emilio De Bono to Italian Eritrea and Rodolfo Graziani to Italian Somaliland along with 100,000 Italian troops to prepare for invasion.

* March 13: Italy and Ethiopia agree on a neutral zone in the Ogaden.
* March 17: Ethiopia again appeals to the League due to Italian build-up.
* March 22: The Italians yield to pressure from the League of Nations for arbitration into the Walwal incident.
* May 11: Ethiopia again protests the Italian mobilization.
* May 20 – 21: The League of Nations holds a special session to discuss the crisis in Ethiopia.
* May 25: League council resolves to meet if no fifth arbitrator has been selected by June 25, or if a settlement isn&#x27;t reached by August 25.

* June 25: Italian and Ethiopian officials meet in The Hague to discuss arbitration.
* July 9: The discussions fall apart.
* July 25: Britain declares an arms embargo on both Italy and Ethiopia.
* July 26: The League confirms that no fifth member has been selected.
* August 3: The League limits arbitration talks to matters except for the sovereignty of Walwal. They are to meet again on September 4 to examine relations between the two countries.
* August 12: Abyssinia pleads for arms embargo to be lifted.
* August 16: France and Britain offer Italy large concessions in Ethiopia to avert war which are rejected.
* August 22: Britain reaffirms its embargo on armaments.
* September 3: The League exonerates both Italy and Ethiopia of the Walwal incident since both powers believed it was within their border.
* September 10: Pierre Laval, Anthony Eden and Sir Samuel Hoare agree on limitations to Italian sanctions.
* September 25: Ethiopia again asks for neutral observers.
* September 28: Ethiopia begins to mobilize its large, but poorly-equipped, army.
* October 3: Italy invades Ethiopia. Italian forces under De Bono advance from Eritrea into northern Ethiopia. Italian forces under Graziani stand ready to advance from Italian Somaliland into southern Ethiopia. Italy is condemned by the League for attacking without formal declaration of war.
* October 5: The northern Italian army captures Adigrat.
* October 6: The northern Italian army captures Adowa.
* October 7: The League of Nations declares Italy the aggressor, prepares to set sanctions against it. 
* October 11: League members voted to impose sanctions unless Italy withdraws.
* October 14: De Bono issues a proclamation ordering the suppression of slavery in Ethiopia.
* October 15: The northern Italian army captures Axum.
* October 18: Britain assures Italy it will not take independent action in the Mediterranean.
*October 27: Mussolini gives Badoglio permission to use mustard gas &quot;as an &#x27;ultima ratio&#x27; to overwhelm enemy resistance and in case of counter-attack.&quot; This was in direct violation of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, which outlawed the use of chemical weapons.
* November 6: Due to the cautious approach of General De Bono, Mussolini threatens to replace him.
* November 8: The northern Italian army captures Mekele.

*December 28. Ostensibly in response to Minniti&#x27;s killing and mutilation, Mussolini gives Badoglio permission to use mustard gas &quot;on a vast scale&quot;. Again, this was in direct violation of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, which outlawed the use of chemical weapons.

<text>Paul Francis Kossoff (14 September 1950 – 19 March 1976) was an English guitarist, best known as the co-founder and guitarist of the rock band Free. In 2010, he was ranked number 51 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

== Early years ==
Kossoff was born on 14 September 1950 in Hampstead, London, the son of Margaret (née Jenkins) and actor David Kossoff. His uncle was the broadcaster Alan Keith and he was a cousin of the judge Brian Keith and the model Linda Keith.

At age nine, Kossoff started classical guitar lessons with Blanche Monroe. His classical guitar training continued until he was fifteen. In December 1965, he saw Eric Clapton with John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers at The Refectory, Golders Green, North West London. This encounter inspired him to purchase a Gibson Les Paul guitar.
During 1966, Kossoff worked as a junior salesman at Selmer&#x27;s Music Shop in Charing Cross Road. He received lessons from session guitarist Colin Falconer, who worked in the guitar department at Selmer&#x27;s.

In 1966 Kossoff joined the Chicago-style blues band Black Cat Bones. The band played with touring blues piano player Champion Jack Dupree, often supporting Fleetwood Mac and other gigs with Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green. Kossoff&#x27;s bandmate in Black Cat Bones was drummer Simon Kirke and the two went on to play on Dupree&#x27;s April 1968 album &quot;When You Feel the Feeling You Was Feeling&quot;.

== Free ==
In April 1968, Kossoff and Kirke teamed up with Paul Rodgers (vocals) and Andy Fraser (bass) to form Free. They toured for two years, during which they recorded two albums: &quot;Tons of Sobs&quot; (1968) and &quot;Free&quot; (1969). Both albums showcased the band&#x27;s blues- and soul-influenced sound, a style that was in contrast to some of their progressive and heavier counterparts at the time.

Success came in 1970 when their third album, &quot;Fire and Water&quot; (1970), spawned the hit &quot;All Right Now&quot;. The band played the Isle of Wight festival to both audience and critical acclaim, followed by sold-out tours in the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan.

However, after the release of the next album, &quot;Highway&quot; (1970) and its relatively poor sales, band pressures led to a split. The live album &quot;Free Live!&quot; was recorded in 1970 and released in 1971 as a farewell record.

Kossoff and Kirke teamed up with Texan keyboard player John &quot;Rabbit&quot; Bundrick and Japanese bass player Tetsu Yamauchi to release the 1971 album &quot;Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit&quot;. Rodgers and Fraser pursued unsuccessful solo projects.

Free reformed and released the album &quot;Free at Last&quot; (1972). Following its release, Fraser decided he had had enough and quit to form Sharks. Free drafted Tetsu and Rabbit for the album &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; (1973) after which the group disbanded.

=== Kossoff song-writing ===
Kossoff co-wrote several Free songs, including &quot;Oh I Wept&quot; and &quot;Mr Big&quot; on the &quot;Fire and Water&quot; album.

== After Free ==
Rodgers and Kirke went on to form the successful supergroup Bad Company.

Kossoff released a solo album, &quot;Back Street Crawler&quot; (1973). He then accompanied John Martyn on a 1975 tour.

Kossoff then assembled a group called Back Street Crawler, which released two albums: &quot;The Band Plays On&quot; in 1975 and &quot;2nd Street&quot; in 1976. Recordings from one of the band&#x27;s UK concerts in 1975 were first released in 1983 on the album &quot;Live at Croydon Fairfield Halls 15/6/75&quot;.

Kossoff&#x27;s guitar playing was also much in demand for session work and he contributed solos on several albums including: Martha Veléz&#x27;s &quot;Fiends and Angels&quot; (1969); Michael Gately&#x27;s &quot;Gately&#x27;s Cafe&quot; (1971) and Mike Vernon&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Bring It Back Home&quot;; Uncle Dog&#x27;s &quot;Old Hat&quot; (1972); Jim Capaldi&#x27;s &quot;Oh How We Danced&quot; (1972) and &quot;Short Cut Draw Blood&quot; (1975); The Amazing Blondel&#x27;s &quot;Mulgrave Street&quot; (1974).

He also played on four demos by Ken Hensley of Uriah Heep (band), (eventually released on the 1994 album titled &quot;From Time to Time&quot;), and three tracks that appear on the CD-only issue of John Martyn&#x27;s &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; album from 1975.

=== Posthumous releases ===
In 1977 career retrospective &quot;Koss&quot; was released and in 1986 &quot;Blue Soul&quot;.

The late 1990s saw a renewed interest in Kossoff and &quot;Blue Soul&quot; was re-released, as well as the five-disc Free box set &quot;Songs of Yesterday&quot;.

In 2006, an unreleased guitar solo surfaced on the title track to the album &quot;All One&quot; by David Elliot, who recorded with Kossoff in the 1970s.

In 2011 a selection of early recordings Kossoff made with Black Cat Bones was released on the album &quot;Paul&#x27;s Blues&quot;.

=== Books ===
In 2000 a Free biography entitled &quot;Heavy Load: The Story of Free&quot; was published.

2017 saw publication of the Paul Kossoff biography entitled &quot;Paul Kossoff: All Right Now – The Guitars, The Gear, The Music.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Drug use ===
Kossoff used drugs from age 15. Simon Kirke has said &quot;he clearly had a predisposition.&quot; He used Mandrax among other drugs. Paul Rodgers has said Kossoff was healthy and playing well in 1973 although this is disputed, but that he wonders about the company that Kossoff kept, and felt that &quot;Koss was just too sensitive for this world.&quot;

Kossoff&#x27;s drug use made him unreliable in the latter stages of Free. Andy Fraser noted &quot;he felt intimidated by those other guitarists, and when people began speaking of him in terms of Clapton and so on, it frightened him. Drugs were a defence, his excuse&quot;.

=== Death ===
Kossoff&#x27;s unhappiness following the break-up of Free and his drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in his health.
In a BBC website page about the 1970 death of Jimi Hendrix, Simon Kirke said that Kossoff idolised Hendrix and never really recovered from his death.

Kossoff died on a flight from Los Angeles to New York City on 19 March 1976 from a pulmonary embolism after a blood clot in his leg moved to his lung, while touring America with Back Street Crawler. His body was returned to England and cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in North West London. His epitaph in the Summerhouse there reads: &quot;All right now&quot;.

== Legacy ==
One of Kossoff&#x27;s signature guitars, a 1957 Fender Stratocaster, was bought by English guitarist Dave Murray of the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden; Murray paid £1,400 for the guitar in 1976 ().

In 2012, one of his most famous and iconic guitars, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul (the Kossoff Burst), was recreated and made into a limited edition reissue by Gibson and named the &#x27;Paul Kossoff 1959 Les Paul Standard&#x27;.

In December 2015 Bonhams listed for auction a Gibson Les Paul Standard owned by Kossoff from 1970 to 1976.

In April 2017 &quot;Guitar&quot; magazine featured the &#x27;stripped&#x27; Gibson Les Paul that Kossoff played at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. Kossoff sold the guitar to Mike Gooch and in May 1994 it was sold for £12,000 at Christie&#x27;s.

<doc id="522274" wikidata="Q2686738" url="?curid=522274" title="Deprotonation">
<text>Deprotonation (or dehydronation) is the removal (transfer) of a proton (or hydron, or hydrogen cation), (H+) from a Brønsted–Lowry acid in an acid–base reaction. The species formed is the conjugate base of that acid. The complementary process, when a proton is added (transferred) to a Brønsted–Lowry base, is protonation (or hydronation). The species formed is the conjugate acid of that base.

A species that can either accept or donate a proton is referred to as amphiprotic. An example is the H2O (water) molecule, which can gain a proton to form the hydronium ion, H3O+, or lose a proton, leaving the hydroxide ion, OH−.

The relative ability of a molecule to give up a proton is measured by its p&quot;K&quot;a value. A low p&quot;K&quot;a value indicates that the compound is acidic and will easily give up its proton to a base. The p&quot;K&quot;a of a compound is determined by many aspects, but the most significant is the stability of the conjugate base. This is primarily determined by the ability (or inability) of the conjugated base to stabilize negative charge. One of the most important ways of assessing a conjugate base&#x27;s ability to distribute negative charge is using resonance. Electron withdrawing groups (which can stabilize the molecule by increasing charge distribution) or electron donating groups (which destabilize by decreasing charge distribution) present on a molecule also determine its p&quot;K&quot;a. The solvent used can also assist in the stabilization of the negative charge on a conjugated base.

Bases used to deprotonate depend on the p&quot;K&quot;a of the compound. When the compound is not particularly acidic, and, as such, the molecule does not give up its proton easily, a base stronger than the commonly known hydroxides is required. Hydrides are one of the many types of powerful deprotonating agents. Common hydrides used are sodium hydride and potassium hydride. The hydride forms hydrogen gas with the liberated proton from the other molecule. The hydrogen is dangerous and could ignite with the oxygen in the air, so the chemical procedure should be done in an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen).

Deprotonation can be an important step in a chemical reaction. Acid–base reactions typically occur faster than any other step which may determine the product of a reaction. The conjugate base is more electron-rich than the molecule which can alter the reactivity of the molecule. For example, deprotonation of an alcohol forms the negatively charged alkoxide, which is a much stronger nucleophile.

To determine whether or not a given base will be sufficient to deprotonate a specific acid, compare the conjugate base with the original base. A conjugate base is formed when the acid is deprotonated by the base. In the image above, hydroxide acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid. The conjugate base is the carboxylate salt. In this case, hydroxide is a strong enough base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid because the conjugate base is more stable than the base because the negative charge is delocalized over two electronegative atoms compared to one. Using p&quot;K&quot;a values, the carboxylic acid is approximately 4 and the conjugate acid, water, is 15.7. Because acids with higher p&quot;K&quot;a values are less likely to donate their protons, the equilibrium will favor their formation. Therefore, the side of the equation with water will be formed preferentially. If, for example, water, instead of hydroxide, was used to deprotonate the carboxylic acid, the equilibrium would not favor the formation of the carboxylate salt. This is because the conjugate acid, hydronium, has a p&quot;K&quot;a of -1.74, which is lower than the carboxylic acid. In this case, equilibrium would favor the carboxylic acid.

<text>Knapdale (, ) forms a rural district of Argyll and Bute in the Scottish Highlands, adjoining Kintyre to the south, and divided from the rest of Argyll to the north by the Crinan Canal. It includes two parishes, North Knapdale and South Knapdale. The area is bounded by sea to the east and west (Loch Fyne and the Sound of Jura respectively), whilst the sea loch of West Loch Tarbert almost completely cuts off the area from Kintyre to the south. The name is derived from two Gaelic elements: &quot;Cnap&quot; meaning hill and &quot;Dall&quot; meaning field.

Knapdale gives its name to the Knapdale National Scenic Area, one of the forty national scenic areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure their protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers in total, of which is on land and is marine (&quot;i.e.&quot; below low tide level).

==Geography==

The A83 runs up the eastern coastline of the area between Tarbert and Lochgilphead; the B8024 also links these two places (which lie outwith Knapdale), but does so via a much longer route along the north shore of West Loch Tarbert and the western coast of South Knapdale. Most of the western coastline of North Knapdale is accessible by two unclassified roads, although there is a gap between Kilmory and Ellary where the route is not public road. The B8024 through Knapdale forms part of Route 78 of the National Cycle Network, which runs between Inverness and Campbeltown.

The western coast of Knapdale is deeply indented by two sea lochs, Loch Sween and Loch Caolisport. The highest point within Knapdale is Stob Odhar, at above sea level. Alongside Stob Odhar, two other summits within Knapdale are sufficiently prominent to be categorised as Marilyns: Cruach Lusach () and Cnoc Reamhar (), however there are no summits above in the area.

Places in Knapdale include:
*Achahoish
*Achnamara
*Ardrishaig
*Crinan
*Kilberry
*Kilmory
*Tayvallich

==Demographics==
The United Kingdom Census 2001 reported a population of 2345 people in South Knapdale and 491 in North Knapdale, a total of 2836 for the district. This represents a slight increase over the 1991 figure of 2704, when there were 439 people living in North Knapdale, and 2265 in South Knapdale. Census figures for the 19th and 20th centuries show a continuing and steady decline of population in North Knapdale, from a peak of around 2700 in 1825 to under 500 in 1950. Possible boundary changes make historic comparisons for South Knapdale less certain, but this part of the region appears not to have suffered the same depopulation as the north, and even modest growth, a rise from around 1750 in 1801 to around 2700 in 1901.

==History==
===Gaels and Norwegians===

In the early first millennium, following an Irish invasion, Gaelic peoples colonised the surrounding area, establishing the kingdom of Dál Riata. The latter was divided into a handful of regions, controlled by particular kin groups, of which the most powerful, the Cenél nGabráin, ruled over Knapdale, along with Kintyre, the region between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne (Craignish, Ardscotnish, Glassary, and Glenary), Arran, and Moyle (in Ulster). Dunadd, the capital of Dál Riata, was located in this region, slightly to the north of the modern day limit of &quot;Knapdale&quot;, in what was then marshland.

This Gaelic kingdom thrived for a few centuries, but was ultimately destroyed when Norse Vikings invaded, and established their own domain, spreading more extensively over the islands north and west of the mainland. Following the unification of Norway, they had become the Norwegian Kingdom of the Isles, locally controlled by Godred Crovan, and known by Norway as &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; (Old Norse, traditionally anglicised as &quot;Sodor&quot;), meaning &quot;southern isles&quot;. The former territory of Dal Riata acquired the geographic description &quot;Argyle&quot; (now &quot;Argyll&quot;): the &quot;Gaelic coast&quot;.
In 1093, Magnus, the Norwegian king, launched a military campaign to assert his authority over the isles. Malcolm, the king of Scotland, responded with a written agreement, accepting that Magnus&#x27; had sovereign authority of over all the western lands that Magnus could encircle by boat. The unspecific wording led Magnus to have his boat dragged across the narrow isthmus at Tarbert, while he rode within it, so that he would thereby acquire Kintyre, in addition to the more natural &quot;islands&quot; of Arran and Bute.

Supposedly, Magnus&#x27;s campaign had been part of a conspiracy against Malcolm, by Donalbain, Malcolm&#x27;s younger brother. When Malcolm was killed in battle a short time later, Donalbain invaded, seized the Scottish kingdom, and displaced Malcolm&#x27;s sons from the throne; on becoming king, Donalbain confirmed Magnus&#x27; gains. Donalbain&#x27;s apparent keenness to do this, however, weakened his support among the nobility, and Malcolm&#x27;s son, Duncan, was able to depose him.

A few years later, following a rebellion against Magnus&#x27; authority in the Isles, he launched another, fiercer, expedition to re-assert his authority. Many of the rebels, and their forces, sought refuge; they chose to flee to Kintyre and Knapdale. In 1098, being aware of Magnus&#x27; ferocity, the new Scottish king, Edgar (another son of Malcolm), quitclaimed to Magnus all sovereign authority over the isles, and the whole Kintyre peninsula - including Knapdale.

===In the Isles===

In the mid 12th century, Somerled, the husband of Godred Crovan&#x27;s granddaughter, led a successful coup, and seized the kingship of the Isles.

During the later part of this century, Knapdale was evidently possessed by Suibhne, eponym of both Castle Sween and the MacSweens. In 1262, following increasing hostility between Norway and Scotland, the Scots forced Suibhne&#x27;s heir, Dubhghall, to give up his lands - including Knapdale - to Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith. In 1263, Hákon Hákonarson, King of Norway launched an invasion of Scotland to reassert Norwegian sovereignty. One of his supporters was Murchadh Mac Suibhne, who was rewarded with the Isle of Arran for his services. Nevertheless, following Hákon&#x27;s death later that year, Magnús Hákonarson, King of Norway ceded the Suðreyjar to Alexander III, King of Scotland, by way of the Treaty of Perth, in return for a very large sum of money.

===Early Scottish Knapdale===

By the 13th century, Somerled&#x27;s descendants had formed into three main families: the MacDougalls, MacRorys and the MacDonalds. At the end of the century, a dispute arose over the Scottish kingship between John Balliol and Robert de Bruys; the MacSweens backed John, hoping to recover Knapdale, the MacDougalls also took John&#x27;s side, while the MacDonalds and MacRory backed de Bruys. When de Bruys defeated John, he declared the MacDougall lands forfeit, and gave them to the MacDonalds; the MacSweens largely became gallowglass mercenaries in Ireland. De Bruys awarded landlordship of the MacSween&#x27;s former Knapdale lands to Walter&#x27;s descendants.

The head of the MacDonald family married the heir of the MacRory family, thereby acquiring the remaining share Somerled&#x27;s realm, and transforming it into the Lordship of the Isles, which lasted for over a century. After 4 years and 3 children, he divorced Amy, and married Margaret, the daughter of Robert II, the Scottish king, who gave him Knapdale as a dowry.

In 1462, however, John, the then Lord of the Isles, plotted with the English king to conquer Scotland; civil war in England delayed the discovery of this for a decade. Upon the discovery, in 1475, there was a call for forfeiture, but a year John calmed the matter, by quitclaiming Ross (Easter, Wester, and Skye), Kintyre, and Knapdale, to Scotland.

As a comital province (medieval Latin:&quot;provincia&quot;), Knapdale was extended to include the adjacent lands between Loch Awe and Loch Fyne, which had been under MacSween lordship. In shrieval terms, Knapdale was initially served by the Sheriff of Perth; 5 years later, however, it was transferred to Tarbertshire. Gradually, when the Campbells to the east and north grew more powerful, the centre of power shifted towards them, and the sheriff court moved to Inveraray at the extreme northeast of the then &quot;Knapdale&quot;. Somewhat inevitably, in 1633, shrieval authority was annexed by the sheriff of Argyll.

When the comital powers were abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act, provincial Knapdale ceased to exist, and the term came to exclusively refer to the present district, south of Lochgilphead. In 1899, counties were formally created, on shrieval boundaries, by a Scottish Local Government Act; the district of Knapdale – together with the rest of the former province – therefore became part of the County of Argyll.

===Modern times===
Knapdale Forest, planted in the 1930s, covers much of the region. During the 1930s, the Ministry of Labour supplied the men from among the unemployed, many coming from the crisis-hit mining and heavy industry communities of the Central Belt. They were housed in one of a number of Instructional Centres created by the Ministry, most of them on Forestry Commission property; by 1938, the Ministry had 38 Instructional Centres across Britain. The camp was used to hold enemy prisoners during the Second World War. The hutted camp in Knapdale was located at Cairnbaan, just south of the Crinan Canal, and a surviving building remains in use as a Forestry and Land Scotland workshop.

Following late 20th century reforms, Knapdale is now within the wider region of Argyll and Bute.

==Ownership==
Much of Knapdale is in the ownership of Forestry and Land Scotland. The two largest private estates are located to either side of Loch Caolisport: the Ellary &amp; Lochead Estate covers on the north side of the loch, whilst the Ormsary covers on the southern side. Ormsay Estate belongs to Sir William Lithgow, 2nd Baronet of Ormsay and vice-chairman of Scottish shipbuilding company Lithgows.

A estate in the area belongs to former chief executive of Network Rail, Iain Coucher. Nick-named &quot;Iainland&quot;, the property was purchased by Coucher in 2010 following his controversial departure from the company, and includes two islands in the Sound of Jura.

==Historic sites==
Local attractions include the Chapel of Keills, which is dedicated to St Cormac and was built in the 1100s. The chapel is home to almost 40 carved stones from the early Christian and Medieval periods, of which the most significant is the eighth century Keills Cross, a free-standing cross similar to those found on Iona. A grave-slab in the chapel has a carving of a clarsach similar to the Queen Mary Harp currently at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, one of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps. West Highland grave slabs from the Argyll area suggest that Knapdale is where this harp originated. Further early Christian and Medieval carved stones can also be found at Kilberry, and at the thirteenth century Kilmory Knap Chapel. Castle Sween, on the shores of Loch Sween, was built in the twelfth century and is one of the oldest castle on the Scottish mainland that can be dated with any certainty.

==Environment==
Four lochs within Knapdale (Loch nan Torran, Loch Fuar-Bheinne, Dubh Loch and Loch Clachaig) are collectively designated as a Special Protection Area due to their importance for breeding black-throated divers. The sea loch of Loch Sween has been designated as a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). The inner loch contains maerl beds and burrowed mud, and supports a colony of volcano worm, whilst the sea bed in the more strongly tidal areas at the mouth of Loch Sween is composed of coarser sediments. The loch is also home to one of Scotland&#x27;s most important populations of native oyster.

Taynish National Nature Reserve is situated within North Knapdale, lying southwest of the village of Tayvallich on the west side of Loch Sween. The reserve encompasses almost all of the Taynish peninsula, which is around long and wide. The woodlands at Taynish are often described as a &#x27;temperate rainforest&#x27;, benefiting from the mild and moist climate brought about by the Gulf Stream. Taynish is owned and managed by NatureScot, and was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1977.

In 2005, the Scottish Government turned down a licence application for unfenced reintroduction of the Eurasian beaver in Knapdale. However, in late 2007 a successful application was made for a release project. The trial was to be run over five years by the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) monitoring the project.
The first beavers were released in May 2009, although the initial release into the wild of 11 animals received a setback during the first year with the disappearance of two animals and the unproven allegation of the illegal shooting of a third. The remaining population was increased in 2010 by further releases, and in November 2016, the Scottish Government announced that beavers could remain permanently, and would be given protected status as a native species within Scotland. Beavers will be allowed to extend their range naturally from Knapdale (and, separately, along the River Tay); however to aid this process and improve the health and resilience of the population a further 28 beavers will be released in Knapdale between 2017 and 2020.

<text>Harold Stanley Ede (7 April 1895 – 15 March 1990), also known as Jim Ede and H. S. Ede, was a British curator, collector of art and friend to artists. He was the creator of Kettle&#x27;s Yard in Cambridge.

==Life and career==

Jim Ede was born in Penarth, Wales, the son of solicitor Edward Hornby Ede and Mildred, a teacher.

He attended the Leys School in Cambridge (1909-12). He began to train as a painter under Stanhope Forbes at Newlyn and then at Edinburgh College of Art before the First World War interrupted his studies. He was commissioned in September 1914, serving with the South Wales Borderers and the Indian Army. He relinquished his commission in consequence of ill health, and was granted the rank of captain, 29 July 1919.

After the war, he continued his studies at the Slade School of Art. In 1921, Ede became assistant curator at the National Gallery of British Art (renamed the Tate Gallery in 1932) in London while continuing to study part-time at the Slade. Shortly after, he married Helen Schlapp whom he had met in Edinburgh. Her father Otto Schlapp lectured at the University of Edinburgh and in 1926 became the University&#x27;s first Professor of German. Robert Schlapp was her brother.

While working at the Tate, Ede tried to promote the work of contemporary artists, including Picasso and Mondrian. However, he was often thwarted by the more conservative attitudes of the gallery directors. During his time at the Tate, Ede formed numerous friendships with avant-garde artists of the day. In the process, he acquired many works of art that were largely under-appreciated at the time. 

In 1927 Ede had acquired Sophie Brzeska&#x27;s estate from the Treasury Solicitor after she died intestate in 1925. This acquisition included not only her writings, but also the estate of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, with many of his works and papers. Ede drew extensively on the letters written by Gaudier to Brzeska, and her writings and other material, when he published &quot;A Life of Gaudier-Brzeska&quot; (London: W. Heinemann) in 1930; the 1931 and later editions are entitled &quot;Savage Messiah&quot;. Ede&#x27;s book became the basis of Ken Russell&#x27;s film of the same name.

==Middle years==
In 1936, Ede tired of fighting the establishment at the Tate and left to live in Morocco, building a house outside Tangiers. Somewhat ahead of his time, he adopted a minimalist style of interior design advocating plain white-washed walls and the minimum of furniture required to complete a room. For the next twenty years, he led an itinerant life, writing, broadcasting and lecturing in Europe and America, while keeping the house in Morocco as a base.

His correspondence with T. E. Lawrence was published by the Golden Cockerel Press in 1942. The collection of forty-four original letters from Lawrence were donated to the University of Essex by Ede in 1964.

==Artistic legacy==

Returning to England in 1956, Ede converted four cottages in Cambridge with the help of Winton Aldridge as a place to live and display his art collection. It was part of his philosophy that art should be shared in a relaxed environment; to this end he would hold &#x27;open house&#x27;, giving personal tours of the collection to students from the University of Cambridge over afternoon tea. Students could also borrow paintings from his collection to hang in their rooms during term-time. 

In 1966, Ede gave the house and collection to the university, establishing the Kettle&#x27;s Yard art gallery. Ede continued living there until 1973 when he moved to Edinburgh where he lived out his retirement. 

The house is preserved as the Edes left it. In 1970, an exhibition gallery was added to Kettle&#x27;s Yard in a modernist style by Leslie Martin and this was extended by Jamie Fobert Architects from 2015. The Edes retired to Edinburgh, where Helen died in 1977.

Ede died in Edinburgh on 15 March 1990.

<doc id="522279" wikidata="Q5977969" url="?curid=522279" title="I Like Pumpkins">
<text>I Like Pumpkins is an illustrated book for young children written and illustrated by children&#x27;s book author Jerry Smath in which a young girl vividly describes her fondness for pumpkins at Halloween. The book is written in rhyming text and includes five pages of pumpkin-related games and puzzles. It has been used in elementary classrooms as both a class reading and supplementary resource. Schools have also used the book as a part of interdisciplinary units on pumpkins which may incorporate the planting and growing of pumpkin plants, arts and crafts activities related to pumpkins, or basic mathematics activities that use pumpkins as units for counting or grouping.

The book was released in the fall of 2003, coinciding with the celebration of Halloween. It was published by Scholastic, Incorporated. Reviewers have suggested that the book may be used by parents or teachers as an introduction to discussion about pumpkins or Halloween.

==Synopsis==
The main character of the book is a little girl who loves pumpkins. She describes the many uses of pumpkins that she appreciates, including plastic pumpkins, pumpkins used to hold candy, jack-o-lanterns, pumpkin seeds, and her favorite, pumpkin pie. The illustrations show her and her mother traveling by car to a pumpkin patch, picking out a pumpkin, and then returning home. Along the way, they see a number of strange sights, including Frankenstein and his pet purple alligator who are returning home with their own respective pumpkins. One image shows a fantasy version of the girl&#x27;s bedroom which is decorated with a pumpkin theme, including a pumpkin-themed headboard for her bed and an alarm clock in the shape of a pumpkin. The book ends with a series of pumpkin-themed puzzles that ask readers to identify a pumpkin that is different from the others, count which of a set of farmers has the most pumpkins, locate hidden pumpkins in a parade scene, and identify a pumpkin that looks like the little obese monkey in the book.

<doc id="522284" wikidata="Q1329507" url="?curid=522284" title="Treshnish Isles">
<text>The Treshnish Isles are an archipelago of small islands and skerries, lying west of the Isle of Mull, in Scotland. They are part of the Inner Hebrides. Trips to the Treshnish Isles operate from Ulva Ferry, Tobermory, Ardnamurchan and Tiree.

==Geography==
The archipelago extends over a distance of roughly , from the island of in the south (towards ) to the north-east. The largest island in the group, Lunga, is west of Gometra, south-west of (on the Isle of Mull), south-east of Coll, and north-west of Staffa.

Other relatively large islands in the group are , Fladda and . There are numerous small skerries, particularly north of Lunga. All the islands are of volcanic origin.

==History==
There are several possible duns on the islands of Iron Age origin. Little is known of the early history, although these prominent landmarks would have been significant waypoints for the Norse settlers during their conquest in the early years of the Kingdom of the Isles, which lasted from the 9th to the 13th centuries.
There are remains on Lunga of a village of blackhouses abandoned in 1857

The Isles were purchased in 1938 by explorer and naturalist Col. Niall Rankin and they were sold to the Hebridean Trust in 2000. The Trust are guardians of the islands to protect them and the wildlife and to monitor and study the ecology and archaeology. In June 2023, the islands were placed under the protection of the National Trust for Scotland, allowing the Hebridean Trust to concentrate on community projects on Tiree.

Due to the beauty and remoteness of the Isles and the abundance of wildlife, particularly the puffins, they are very popular with tourists who visit by boat, generally to Lunga, for day-trips during the summer.

==Etymology==
 is a Gaelic name of unknown meaning that includes the Old Norse root , meaning &#x27;headland&#x27;.

 is also known as &quot;The Dutchman&#x27;s Cap&quot; in English due to its shape. is from the Gaelic , with meaning &#x27;bank&#x27; or &#x27;dune&#x27; and simply being a diminutive in contrast to . is also known as in Gaelic, which means &#x27;dune of the Ross&#x27; and is a reference to the shape of the island when framed against the Ross of Mull. &quot;Lunga&quot; is probably from the Old Norse , meaning &#x27;longship island&#x27;. and are Gaelic names meaning &#x27;Irishman&#x27;s skerry&#x27; and &#x27;castle skerry&#x27; respectively. means &#x27;cairn of the large fort&#x27; and is thus &#x27;cairn of the small fort&#x27;.

The name &quot;Fladda&quot; originates from the Old Norse for &#x27;flat island&#x27;.

==Natural history and conservation==
The Treshnish Isles are part of the Loch na Keal National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland. They are also designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, a Special Protection Area due to their importance for breeding seabirds and a marine Special Area of Conservation. They are also known for their Atlantic grey seals and ruined castles.

<doc id="522287" wikidata="Q5599047" url="?curid=522287" title="Great Depression in Canada">
<text>The worldwide Great Depression of the early 1930s was a social and economic shock that left millions of Canadians unemployed, hungry and often homeless. Few countries were affected as severely as Canada during what became known as the &quot;Dirty Thirties&quot;, due to Canada&#x27;s heavy dependence on raw material and farm exports, combined with a crippling Prairies drought known as the Dust Bowl. Widespread losses of jobs and savings ultimately transformed the country by triggering the birth of social welfare, a variety of populist political movements, and a more activist role for government in the economy.

In 1930-1931 the Canadian government responded to the Great Depression by applying severe restrictions to entry into Canada. New rules limited immigration to British and American subjects or agriculturalists with money, certain classes of workers, and immediate family of the Canadian residents. A large number of unemployed immigrants were also deported. 

== Economic results ==
By 1930, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell, as did prices. Gross National Expenditure had declined 42% from the 1929 levels. In some areas, the decline was far worse. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief.

Further damage was the reduction of investment: both large companies and individuals were unwilling and unable to invest in new ventures.

In 1932, industrial production was only at 58% of the 1929 level, the second lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which only saw it fall to 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 55% of the 1929 level, again worse than any nation other than the U.S.

===Impact===

Canada&#x27;s economy at the time was just starting to shift from primary industry (farming, fishing, mining and logging) to manufacturing. Exports of raw materials plunged, and employment, prices and profits fell in every sector. Canada was the worst-hit because of its economic position. It was further affected as its main trading partners were Britain and the U.S., both of which were badly affected by the worldwide depression.

One of the areas not affected was bush flying, which, thanks to a mining and exploration boom, continued to thrive throughout this period. Even so, most bush flying companies lost money, impacted by the government&#x27;s cancellation of airmail contracts in 1931-2.

===Unemployment===
Urban unemployment nationwide was 19%; Toronto&#x27;s rate was 17%, according to the census of 1931. Farmers who stayed on their farms were not considered unemployed. By 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one-fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance. Wages fell as did prices. In some areas, such as mining and lumbering areas, the decline was far worse.

=== Prairie Provinces ===
The Prairie Provinces and Western Canada were the hardest-hit. In the rural areas of the prairies, two thirds of the population were on relief. The region fully recovered after 1939. The fall of wheat prices drove many farmers to the towns and cities, such as Calgary, Alberta; Regina, Saskatchewan; and Brandon, Manitoba. Population in the prairie provinces fell below natural replacement level. There was also migration from the southern prairies affected by Dust Bowl conditions such as the Palliser&#x27;s Triangle to aspen parkland in the north.
During the depression, there was a rise of working class militancy organized by the Communist Party. The labour unions largely retreated in response to the ravages of the depression at the same time that significant portions of the working class, including the unemployed, clamoured for collective action.

Numerous strikes and protests were led by the Communists, many of which culminated in violent clashes with the police. Some notable ones include a coal miners strike that resulted in the Estevan Riot in Estevan, Saskatchewan where four miners were killed by the RCMP in 1931, a waterfront strike in Vancouver that culminated with the &quot;Battle of Ballantyne Pier&quot; in 1935, and numerous unemployed demonstrations up to and including the On-to-Ottawa Trek that left one Regina police constable and one protester dead in the &quot;Regina Riot&quot;. Although the actual number of Communist Party militants remained small, their impact was far disproportionate to their numbers, in large part because of the anticommunist reaction of the government, especially the policies of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett who vowed to crush Communism in Canada with an &quot;iron heel of ruthlessness&quot;.

These conflicts diminished after 1935, when the Communist Party shifted strategies and Bennett&#x27;s Conservatives were defeated. Agitation and unrest nonetheless persisted throughout the depression, marked by periodic clashes, such as a sit-down strike in Vancouver that ended with &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;. These developments had far-reaching consequences in shaping the postwar environment, including the domestic cold war climate, the rise of the welfare state, and the implementation of an institutional framework for industrial relations.

===Women===

Women&#x27;s primary role were as housewives; without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. The birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935. In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.

Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed.

Housewives updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. These strategies show that women&#x27;s domestic labor—cooking, cleaning, budgeting, shopping, childcare—was essential to the economic maintenance of the family and offered room for economies. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.

Women held 25-30% of the jobs in the cities. Few women were employed in heavy industry, railways or construction. Many were household workers or were employed in restaurants and family-owned shops. Women factory workers typically handled clothing and food. Educated women had a narrow range of jobs, such as clerical work and teaching. It was expected that a woman give up a good job when she married. Srigley emphasizes the wide range of background factors and family circumstances, arguing that gender itself was typically less important than race, ethnicity, or class.

===Teachers===
School budgets were cut a lot across the country, although enrollments went up and up because dropouts could not find jobs. To save money the districts consolidated nearby schools, dropped staff lines, postponed new construction, and increased class size. Middle-class well-educated teachers were squeezed by the financial crisis facing their employers. In Ontario, new teachers were not hired so the average age and experience increased. However, their salaries fell and men who otherwise would have taken higher status business jobs increasingly competed against women. Married women were not hired on the grounds it was unfair for one family to have two scarce jobs that breadwinners needed. Women teachers, who had made major gains in the 1910-20 era, saw themselves discriminated against. The teacher&#x27;s unions were practically helpless in the crisis, even in Ontario where they were strongest. After prosperity returned in the 1940s, however, money was available again, there was a shortage of teachers, and the unions proved more effective. For example, in Quebec, the Corporation Général des Instituteurs et des Institutrices Catholics (CIC) was founded in 1946 (it became the Centrale de l&#x27;Enseignement du Québec (CEQ) in 1967). It sought higher pensions and salaries and better working conditions, while insisting the teachers were full-fledged professionals. In remote rural areas professionalization was uncommon; local school boards tightly controlled the one-room schools, typically hiring local women with a high school education or a year at university as teachers, so their meagre salaries would remain in the community.

===Labour policy===
Case studies of four Canadian textile firms—two cotton and two hosiery and knitting—demonstrate the range business response to the economic crisis. Each faced a different array of conditions, and each devised the appropriate restructuring strategies. The large corporations responded by investing in more expensive machinery and automation, hiring less skilled workers to tend the automated equipment, and tweaking their product lines to changing consumer tastes. However the smaller hosiery and knitting firms lacked the capital to invest or the research needed to monitor consumer tastes. They used time-tested &quot;Taylorized&quot; scientific management or made piecemeal changes. Power shifted upward to management, as strikes were too risky in the early 1930s and the opportunity to find a better job had drastically narrowed. By 1935, however, the influence of militant American unions spilled over the border and Canadian unions became more forceful and harmonious. The activity was most notable in Ontario&#x27;s automobile factories, beginning in Windsor in late 1936, where the new Automobile Workers of America (UAW) chartered its first Canadian local at the Kelsey-Hayes factory.

==World trade==
The Stock Market crash in New York led people to hoard their money; as consumption fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic links between the two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not as sharp as that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.

Canada did have some advantages over other countries, especially its extremely stable banking system that had no failures during the entire depression, compared to over 9,000 small banks that collapsed in the United States.

Canada was hurt badly because of its reliance on base commodities, whose prices fell by over 50%, and because of the importance of international trade. In the 1920s about 25% of the Canadian Gross National Product was derived from exports. The first reaction of the U.S. was to raise tariffs via the &quot;Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act&quot;, passed into law June 17, 1930. This hurt the Canadian economy more than most other countries in the world, and Canada retaliated by raising its own rates on American exports and by switching business to the Empire.

In an angry response to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism and a system of Commonwealth preference during the winter of 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the international economy, which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.

==Government reaction==
At the Depression, the provincial and municipal governments were already in debt after an expansion of infrastructure and education during the 1920s. It thus fell to the federal government to try to improve the economy. When the Depression began Mackenzie King was Prime Minister. He believed that the crisis would pass, refused to provide federal aid to the provinces, and only introduced moderate relief efforts. The government&#x27;s reaction to The Great Depression is the focus of the 2013 documentary Catch The Westbound Train from Prairie Coast Films.

===New Deal===
The Bennett Government, which defeated Mackenzie King in the 1930 election, initially refused to offer large-scale aid or relief to the provinces, much to the anger of provincial premiers, but it eventually gave in and started a Canadian &quot;New Deal&quot; type of relief by 1935. By 1937, the worst of the Depression had passed, but it left its mark on the country&#x27;s economic landscape. Atlantic Canada was especially hard hit. Newfoundland (an independent dominion at the time) was bankrupt economically and politically and gave up responsible government by reverting to direct British control.

First World War veterans built on a history of postwar political activism to play an important role in the expansion of state-sponsored social welfare in Canada. Arguing that their wartime sacrifices had not been properly rewarded, veterans claimed that they were entitled to state protection from poverty and unemployment on the home front. The rhetoric of patriotism, courage, sacrifice, and duty created powerful demands for jobs, relief, and adequate pensions that should, veterans argued, be administered as a right of social citizenship and not a form of charity. At the local, provincial, and national political levels, veterans fought for compensation and recognition for their war service, and made their demands for jobs and social security a central part of emerging social policy.

The Liberal Party lost the 1930 election to the Conservative Party, led by R.B. Bennett. Bennett, a successful western businessman, campaigned on high tariffs and large-scale spending. Make-work programs were begun, and welfare and other assistance programs became vastly larger. This led to a large federal deficit, however. Bennett became wary of the budget shortfalls by 1932, and cut back severely on federal spending. This only deepened the depression as government employees were put out of work and public works projects were cancelled.

One of the greatest burdens on the government was the Canadian National Railway (CNR). The federal government had taken over a number of defunct and bankrupt railways during the First World War and the 1920s. The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during the boom years it seemed payable. The Depression turned this debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government.

With falling support and the depression only getting worse, Bennett attempted to introduce policies based on the New Deal of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the United States. Bennett thus called for a minimum wage, unemployment insurance, and other such programs. This effort was largely unsuccessful; the provinces challenged the rights of the federal government to manage these programs. Some of the federal efforts were successful: the &quot;Companies&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot; and &quot;Farmers&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot;, which provided alternatives to bankruptcy for distressed businesses, were held to be constitutional by the &quot;Reference Re Farmers&#x27; Creditors Arrangement Act&quot;.

The judicial and political failure of Bennett&#x27;s New Deal legislation shifted the struggle to reconstitute capitalism to the provincial and municipal levels of the state. Attempts to deal with the dislocations of the Great Depression in Ontario focused on the &quot;sweatshop crisis&quot; that came to dominate political and social discourse after 1934. Ontario&#x27;s 1935 &quot;Industrial Standards Act&quot; (ISA) was designed to bring workers and employers together under the auspices of the state to establish minimum wages and work standards. The establishment of New Deal style industrial codes was premised on the mobilization of organized capital and organized labour to combat unfair competition, stop the spread of relief-subsidized labour, and halt the predations of sweatshop capitalism. Although the ISA did not bring about extensive economic regulation, it excited considerable interest in the possibility of government intervention. Workers in a diverse range of occupations, from asbestos workers to waitresses, attempted to organize around the possibility of the ISA. The importance of the ISA lies in what it reveals about the nature of welfare, wage labour, the union movement, competitive capitalism, business attitudes toward industrial regulation, and the role of the state in managing the collective affairs of capitalism. The history of the ISA also suggests that &quot;regulatory unionism&quot;, as described by Colin Gordon in his work on the American New Deal, may have animated key developments in Canadian social, economic, and labour history.

The failure to help the economy led to the federal Conservatives&#x27; defeat in the 1935 election when the Liberals, still led by Mackenzie King, returned to power.

The public at large lost faith in both the Liberal Party of Canada and the Conservative Party of Canada. This caused the rise of a third party: the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (a socialist party that achieved some success before joining the Canadian Labour Congress in 1961, becoming the New Democratic Party).

With the worst of the Depression over, the government implemented some relief programs such as the &quot;National Housing Act&quot; and National Employment Commission, and it established Trans-Canada Airlines (1937, the predecessor to Air Canada). However, it took until 1939 and the outbreak of war for the Canadian economy to return to 1929 levels.

===Liberals return===
After 1936 the prime minister lost patience when westerners preferred radical alternatives such as the CCF (Co-operative Commonwealth Federation) and Social Credit to his middle-of-the-road liberalism. Indeed, he came close to writing off the region with his comment that the prairie dust bowl was &quot;part of the U.S. desert area. I doubt if it will be of any real use again.&quot; Instead he paid more attention to the industrial regions and the needs of Ontario and Quebec regarding the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway project with the United States. As for the unemployed, he was hostile to federal relief and reluctantly accepted a Keynesian solution that involved federal deficit spending, tax cuts and subsidies to the housing market.

Mackenzie King returned as prime minister, serving until his retirement in 1948. During all but the last two years he was also secretary of state for external affairs, taking personal charge of foreign policy.

===Social Credit===
Social Credit (often called &quot;SoCred&quot;) was a populist political movement strongest in Alberta and neighbouring British Columbia, 1930s-1970s. Social Credit was based on the economic theories of an Englishman, C. H. Douglas. His theories became very popular across the nation in the early 1930s. A central proposal was the free distribution of dividends (or social credit), called &quot;funny money&quot; by the opposition.

During the Great Depression in Canada the demand for radical action peaked around 1934, after the worst period was over and the economy was recovering. Mortgage debt was significant because farmers could not meet their interest payments. The insecurity of farmers, whose debts were increasing and who had no legal protection against foreclosure, was a potent factor in creating a mood of political desperation. The radical farmers party, UFA was baffled by the depression and Albertans demanded new leadership.

Prairie farmers had always believed that they were being exploited by Toronto and Montreal. What they lacked was a prophet who would lead them to the promised land. The Social Credit movement began in Alberta in 1932; it became a political movement in 1935 and suddenly burned like a prairie fire. The prophet and new premier was radio evangelist William Aberhart (1878–1943). The message was biblical prophecy. Aberhart was a fundamentalist, preaching the revealed word of God and quoting the Bible to find a solution for the evils of the modern, materialistic world: the evils of sophisticated academics and their biblical criticism, the cold formality of middle-class congregations, the vices of dancing and movies and drink. &quot;Bible Bill&quot; preached that the capitalist economy was rotten because of its immorality; specifically it produced goods and services but did not provide people with sufficient purchasing power to enjoy them. This could be remedied by the giving out money in the form of &quot;social credit&quot;, or $25 a month for every man and woman. This pump priming was guaranteed to restore prosperity, he prophesied to the 1600 Social Credit clubs he formed in the province.

Alberta&#x27;s businessmen, professionals, newspaper editors and the traditional middle-class leaders vehemently protested Aberhart&#x27;s crack-pot ideas, but they had not solved any problems and spoke not of the promised land ahead. Aberhart&#x27;s new party in 1935 elected 56 members to the Alberta Assembly, compared to 7 for all the other parties.

Alberta&#x27;s Social Credit Party remained in power for 36 years until 1971. It was re-elected by popular vote no less than 9 times, achieving success by moving from left to the right.

====Social Credit in office====
Once in office in Alberta, Aberhart gave a high priority to balancing the provincial budget. He reduced expenditures and increased the sales tax and the income tax. The poor and unemployed got nothing. The $25 monthly social dividend never arrived, as Aberhart decided nothing could be done until the province&#x27;s financial system was changed, and 1936 Alberta defaulted on its bonds. He did pass a Debt Adjustment Act that cancelled all the interest on mortgages since 1932 and limited all interest rates on mortgages to 5%, in line with similar laws passed by other provinces. In 1937 backbenchers passed a radical banking law that was disallowed by the national government (banking was a federal responsibility). Efforts to control the press were also disallowed. The party was authoritarian and tried to exert detailed control over its officeholders; those who rebelled were purged or removed from office by the new device of recall elections. Although Aberhart was hostile to banks and newspapers, he was basically in favour of capitalism and did not support socialist policies as did the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan.

By 1938 the Social Credit government abandoned its notions about the $25 payouts, but its inability to break with UFA policies led to disillusionment and heavy defections from the party. Aberhart&#x27;s government was re-elected in the 1940 election, carrying 43% of the vote. The prosperity of the Second World War relieved the economic fears and hatreds that had fuelled farmer unrest. Aberhart died in 1943, and was succeeded as Premier by his student at the Prophetic Bible Institute and lifelong close disciple, Ernest C. Manning (1908–1996).

The Social Credit party, now firmly on the right, governed Alberta until 1968 under Manning.

==Recovery==
The Canadian recovery from the Great Depression proceeded slowly. Economists Pedro Amaral and James MacGee find that the Canadian recovery has important differences with the United States. In the U.S. productivity recovered quickly while the labour force remained depressed throughout the decade. In Canada employment quickly recovered but productivity remained well below trend. Amaral and MacGee suggest that this decline is due to the sustained reduction in international trade during the 1930s.

In the midst of the Great Depression, the Crown-in-Council attempted to uplift the people, and created two national corporations: the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC), and the Bank of Canada. The former, established in 1932, was seen as a means to keep the country unified and uplifted in these harsh economic times. Many poor citizens found radio as an escape and used it to restore their own faiths in a brighter future. Broadcasting coast to coast mainly in English, with some French, primarily in Quebec, the CRBC played a vital role in keeping the morale up for Canadians everywhere. The latter was used to regulate currency and credit which had been horribly managed amongst Canadian citizens in the prior years. It was also set up to serve as a private banker’s bank and to assist and advise the Canadian government on its own debts and financial matters. The bank played an important role to help steer government spending in the right direction. The bank&#x27;s effort took place through the tough years of the depression and on to the prosperity that followed into and after the Second World War.

Both of these corporations were seen as positive moves by the Canadian government to help get the economy back on track. 1937 was an important year in the recovery from the Great Depression. The Bank of Canada was nationalized in that year, and the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (CRBC) became the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in that same year. Both corporations were successful aids in the cultural and financial recovery of the Canadian economy during the Great depression.

It took the outbreak of World War II to pull Canada out of the depression. From 1939, an increased demand in Europe for materials, and increased spending by the Canadian government created a strong boost for the economy. Unemployed men enlisted in the military. By 1939, Canada was in the first prosperity period in the business cycle in a decade. This coincided with the recovery in the American economy, which created a better market for exports and a new inflow of much needed capital.

<text>Kathleen Vaughan Wilkes (23 June 1946 – 21 August 2003) was an English philosopher and academic who played an important part in rebuilding the education systems of former Communist countries after 1990. She established her reputation as an academic with her contributions to the philosophy of mind in two major works and many articles in professional journals. As a conscientious college tutor, she won the respect and affection of her students and academic colleagues. Her most notable contribution lay in her clandestine activities behind the Iron Curtain, which led to the establishment of underground universities and academic networks in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. For her work in support of this network President Václav Havel awarded her the Commemorative Medal of the President of the Czech Republic in October 1998.

==Early life and academic career==
Wilkes, who was known as Kathy, was the daughter of Rev. J C Vaughan Wilkes who had been a master at Eton and Warden of Radley College before entering holy orders, and was for many years vicar of Marlow. Her paternal grandparents had founded and run St Cyprian&#x27;s School, Eastbourne, while her grandfather on her mother&#x27;s side (the Very Rev Cyril Alington) had been Headmaster of Eton, Dean of Durham and author of many famous hymns. She was educated at Wycombe Abbey and St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she achieved a double First. Her achievement was all the greater in light of the excruciating pain she was suffering from as a result of a teenage riding accident. She spent a period at Princeton University, where she studied with Thomas Nagel, Richard Rorty and others, and received her Ph.D. She then lived the life of an Oxbridge don. After a time at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, she became a fellow of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, in 1973, and was a lecturer in philosophy in the University of Oxford for the rest of her career.

== Essay Prize ==
In 2021 one of the premier essay competitions at Wycombe Abbey, her former school, was named for Kathy Wilkes. Each year the year 9 (UIV in the school&#x27;s lexicon) pupils are invited to submit essays of up to 1500 words on topics ranging from philosophy to history to education theory. The prize is judged by Wycombe Abbey Seniors.

==Work in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe: Czechoslovakia==

During her time at Oxford, she worked, often in secret, for the education systems of eastern Europe. In 1979 she was the first of Oxford university&#x27;s philosophers to respond to an invitation from the dissident philosophical community in Prague to conduct secret seminars there. She showed extraordinary courage in conducting secret meetings in crowded flats with groups of philosophers. Despite her large frame and ungainly walk, she would lead the secret policemen who followed her on wild goose chases through Slavic cities, unconcerned by their harassment. She made the difficult and risky trip many times, smuggling in banned books and taking out samizdat manuscripts. With her western friends, she created the Jan Hus Foundation, which was to become a major source of support for the dissident community. She encouraged and financially supported dissident intellectuals, finally bringing the Czech philosopher Julius Tomin and family to England. Having lost her Czech visa, she achieved this by returning to Prague with a new passport in her full name &quot;Vaughan-Wilkes&quot; to confuse the authorities. Having never driven there before, she drove the family precariously in a heavily overladen Zhiguli to the West knowing that the slightest traffic infringement would bring down the law. Back in England she arranged housing and paid for the children&#x27;s education.

==Work in the former Yugoslavia==

Wilkes became chairman of the executive committee of the Inter-University Centre in Dubrovnik in 1986. Concerned at the lack of voice for philosophers in the east who were interested in the analytic approach, with Bill Newton-Smith as her co-editor, she created a journal known initially as the Dubrovnik Papers, and now flourishing as &quot;International Studies in the Philosophy of Science&quot;. She paid for a young Croatian psychologist&#x27;s education at Oxford, maintaining throughout that the fees were being met by a fictitious &#x27;Alington trust&#x27;. During the siege of Dubrovnik by the JNA in 1991–1992 during the Croatian war of independence, she refused to leave, seeing it her duty to give comfort and support to the sufferers and to inform the world of the city&#x27;s distress.

Following the collapse of their political regimes, especially that of the former Yugoslavia, she worked to try to restore their academic standards, spending time in Croatia, where she was honoured with a doctorate from the University of Zagreb.

Kathy Wilkes was specifically referenced by her colleague Roger Scruton who took her as his model of the English gentleman, arguing that &quot;her virtues were revealed in nothing so much, as her habit of concealing them&quot;. She appeared in the Channel 4 documentary series &quot;College Girls&quot;, broadcast in 2002 about some St Hilda&#x27;s students.

<text>Jesse Cail Burkett (December 4, 1868 – May 27, 1953), nicknamed &quot;Crab&quot;, was an American professional baseball left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1890 to 1905 for the New York Giants, Cleveland Spiders, St. Louis Perfectos / Cardinals, St. Louis Browns, and Boston Americans.

Burkett batted over .400 twice, and held the major league single-season hits record for 15 years. After his playing career, Burkett managed in the minor leagues. In 1946, Burkett was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Burkett holds the record for the most inside-the-park home runs in MLB history, with 55. He is also regarded as one of the greatest bunters of all time.

==Early life==
Burkett was born in Wheeling, West Virginia, to Granville and Ellen Burkett. His father was a laborer and painter who worked for the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company. Beginning his professional career as a pitcher, he won 27 games at the age of 19 in 1888 for the Scranton Miners of the Central League. In 1889, he compiled a 39–6 win–loss record for the Worcester Grays of the New England League. He acquired his nickname, &quot;Crab&quot;, due to his serious disposition, and willingness to argue, fight and insult sportswriters, umpires, opposing players, and rookies.

==Career==
===Early career===
Burkett made his major league debut for the New York Giants of the National League (NL) in 1890 as a pitcher and outfielder. His pitching was ineffective as he went 3–10 with an earned run average of 5.57. As an outfielder he had a breakout year with a batting average of .309, good for second-best on the team. He was then purchased by the Cleveland Spiders in February 1891 and played most of 1891 in the minors, batting .316 for the Lincoln Rustlers and pitching to a 4–6 record. He played the last 40 games of the 1891 season with the Cleveland Spiders and continued to play for them through the 1898 season. In 1892, he hit .275 and was among the league&#x27;s top ten players in runs scored and triples. The next season, his batting average increased to .348 (sixth highest in the league) and drew 98 walks (fifth-most in the league). He remained in the top ten in walks in almost every season throughout his career.

Burkett was never known as a great defender, but after committing a league leading 46 errors in 1893, he was coached by fellow outfielder Jimmy McAleer to improve his fielding. Nonetheless, he routinely finished in the top five for errors committed by an outfielder and has the fourth-most errors committed by an outfielder in history.

===Peak years and batting .400===
In 1895, Burkett batted .405 and led the NL in batting average, beating Ed Delahanty who also had an average of over .400, and hits (225), which were 12 more than Hall of Famer Willie Keeler. The following season, he set a career-high in batting average, at .410, and led the league in batting average, hits (240), and runs scored (160). His 240 hits were a major league record for 15 years until Ty Cobb hit 248 in 1911. Burkett was the second player in major league history to bat over .400 twice, the first being Ed Delahanty. The Spiders finished second in 1895 and 1896 and played the Baltimore Orioles both seasons in the Temple Cup series, beating the Orioles in 1895.

Early in the 1897 season, Burkett was hit in the head by a pitch by Fred Klobedanz which knocked him unconscious. He was out of action for two weeks, but played on May 31, collecting two hits in his first game back. On August 4, 1897 Burkett was ejected from both games of a doubleheader against the Louisville Colonels. In the first game, Burkett and an umpire (Bill Wolf) got into a heated argument and Burkett was thrown out; when he did not leave the field, the umpire threatened to forfeit the game to Louisville. Manager Patsy Tebeau agreed to forfeit the game to the Colonels by a score of 9–0. In the next game of the double header, the arguments against Bill Wolf continued, and by the ninth inning Burkett was ejected again. Similar to the first game, he did not leave the field and two police officers were called in and dragged Burkett from the field. In the 1897 season, Burkett finished third in batting average behind fellow Hall of Famers Willie Keeler and Fred Clarke.

===Move to St. Louis and later career===
By the end of 1898 the Cleveland Spiders were unable to afford to play in Cleveland and pay their highly paid players, and as a result played 35 of their last 38 games on the road. In the offseason, owner Frank Robison bought the struggling St. Louis Cardinals and in March 1898, Burkett along with teammate Cy Young were moved from the Cleveland Spiders to the St. Louis Perfectos. He played for the Perfectos/Cardinals for three seasons. In 1899 he had originally finished the season batting .402 (making him the first baseball player to hit .400 or greater in three separate seasons), but it was downgraded to .396 later.

In 1901, he led the NL in batting average (.376), on-base percentage (.440), hits (226), and runs scored (142); this marked the third time he had led the league in batting average. Before the 1902 season, Burkett jumped to the St. Louis Browns of the American League and batted over .300 for the last time in his career. The following year, the American League began to count foul balls as strikes, causing his batting average to fall below .300 on the season for the first time since 1892. The next year his batting average fell again to .271, and had a career low in stolen bases. His errors in the outfield went down, but that was partially due to his decreased range and fewer opportunities.

In 1905, he was traded to the Boston Americans for George Stone; this meant he could be closer to his home in Worcester. His level of play continued to decrease as he set a career low in batting average as Boston finished in fourth place at the end of the season. At the end of the season, he retired. He had the second most career hits in baseball at the time. He has the highest batting average (.378) and on-base percentage (.444) in St. Louis Cardinals history.

==Later life==
Burkett managed the New England League&#x27;s Worcester Busters from 1906 to 1915 and played some games for the team, as well. In 1906, he led the league with a .344 batting average.

Newspapers described Burkett as retiring from baseball in 1916. He secured a position with a brass factory in Worcester in December. However, he signed on as a coach with College of the Holy Cross late that month. In four seasons coaching the Holy Cross Crusaders, Burkett amassed an 88–12–1 record (); nine players on his 1919 team were designated All-East players.

Burkett managed sporadically in the minor leagues until 1933. He was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1946. The Wheeling native became the first West Virginian elected into the Hall of Fame.

Burkett died in Worcester, Massachusetts, on May 27, 1953.

<text>This is a list of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] actors in the United States, including Alaskan Natives.

While Native American identity can be complex, it is rooted in political sovereignty that predates the creation of colonial nation states like the United States, Canada, and Mexico and persists into the 21st century recognized under international law by treaty. The Bureau of Indian Affairs defines &quot;Native American&quot; as having American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry. Legally, being Native American is defined as being enrolled in a federally recognized tribe, including Alaskan villages. Ethnologically, factors such as culture, history, language, religion, and familial kinships can influence Native American identity. All individuals on this list should have confirmed Native American ancestry. Historical figures might predate tribal enrollment practices and would be included based on ethnological tribal membership, while any contemporary individuals should either be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes or have cited Native American ancestry and be recognized as being Native American by their respective tribes(s). Contemporary unenrolled individuals should only be listed as being &quot;of descent&quot; from a tribe if they have confirmed heritage.

<doc id="522298" wikidata="Q1352872" url="?curid=522298" title="Robert F. Kennedy Jr.">
<text>Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. (born January 17, 1954), also known by his initials RFK Jr., is an American politician, environmental lawyer, author, anti-vaccine activist, and conspiracy theorist serving since 2025 as the 26th United States secretary of health and human services. A member of the Kennedy family, he is a son of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy. 

He began his career as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. In the mid-1980s, he joined two nonprofits focused on environmental protection: Riverkeeper and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). He became an adjunct professor of environmental law at Pace University School of Law in 1986. In 1987, Kennedy founded Pace&#x27;s Environmental Litigation Clinic. He founded the nonprofit environmental group Waterkeeper Alliance in 1999. He first ran as a Democrat and later started an independent campaign in the 2024 United States presidential election, before withdrawing from the race and endorsing Republican nominee Donald Trump.

Since 2005, Kennedy has promoted vaccine misinformation and public-health conspiracy theories, including the scientifically disproved claim of a causal link between vaccines and autism. He is the founder and former chairman of Children&#x27;s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine advocacy group and proponent of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Kennedy has written books including &quot;The Riverkeepers&quot; (1997), &quot;Crimes Against Nature&quot; (2004), &quot;The Real Anthony Fauci&quot; (2021), and &quot;A Letter to Liberals&quot; (2022).

==Early life and education==

Kennedy was born at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on January 17, 1954. He is the third of eleven children of senator and U.S. attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. He is a nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy.

Kennedy was raised at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and at Hickory Hill, the family estate in McLean, Virginia. In June 1972, Kennedy graduated from the Palfrey Street School, a day school in a Boston suburb. While attending Palfrey, he lived with a surrogate family at a farmhouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Kennedy continued his education at Harvard University, graduating in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in American history and literature. He earned a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1982 and a Master of Laws from Pace University in 1987.

He was nine years old when his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963, and 14 when his father was assassinated while running for president in 1968. Kennedy learned of his father&#x27;s shooting while at Georgetown Preparatory School. A few hours later, he flew to Los Angeles on Vice President Hubert Humphrey&#x27;s plane, along with his older siblings, Kathleen and Joseph. He was with his father when he died. Kennedy was a pallbearer at his father&#x27;s funeral, where he spoke and read excerpts from his father&#x27;s speeches at the mass commemorating his death at Arlington National Cemetery.

After his father&#x27;s death, Kennedy struggled with drug abuse, which led to his arrest in Barnstable, Massachusetts, for cannabis possession at age 16, and his expulsion from two boarding schools: Millbrook and Pomfret. During this time, some in the Kennedy family regarded him as the &quot;ringleader&quot; of a pack of spoiled, rich kids who called themselves the &quot;Hyannis Port Terrors&quot;, engaging in vandalism, theft, and drug use. His first cousin Caroline Kennedy later blamed Kennedy for leading other members of their family &quot;down the path of drug addiction&quot;, calling him a &quot;predator&quot;. At Harvard, Kennedy continued his experimentation with heroin and cocaine, often with his brother David, earning a reputation that has been described as a &quot;pied piper&quot; and &quot;drug dealer&quot;.

== Legal career ==
===Manhattan DA&#x27;s office===
In 1982, Kennedy was sworn in as an assistant district attorney for Manhattan. After failing the New York bar exam, he resigned in July 1983.

=== Conviction for heroin possession ===
On September 16, 1983, Kennedy was charged with heroin possession in Rapid City, South Dakota. In February 1984, he pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of possession of heroin, and was sentenced to two years of probation and community service. After his arrest, he entered a drug treatment center. To satisfy conditions of his probation, Kennedy worked as a volunteer for the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and was required to attend regular drug rehabilitation sessions. Kennedy asserted that this ended his 14 years of heroin use, which he said had begun when he was 15. His probation ended a year early.

===Riverkeeper===
In 1984, Kennedy began volunteering at the Hudson River Fisherman&#x27;s Association, renamed Riverkeeper in 1986 after a patrol boat it had built with settlement money from legal victories preceding Kennedy&#x27;s arrival. After he was admitted to the New York bar in 1985, Riverkeeper hired him as senior attorney. Kennedy litigated and supervised environmental enforcement lawsuits on the east coast estuaries on behalf of Hudson Riverkeeper and the Long Island Soundkeeper, where he was also a board member. Long Island Soundkeeper sued several municipalities and cities along the Connecticut and New York coastlines. On the Hudson, Kennedy sued municipalities and industries, including General Electric, to stop discharging pollution and clean up legacy contamination. His work at Riverkeeper set long-term environmental legal standards.

In 1995, Kennedy advocated for repeal of legislation that he considered unfriendly to the environment. In 1997, he worked with John Cronin to write &quot;The Riverkeepers&quot;, a history of the early Riverkeepers and a primer for the Waterkeeper movement.

In 2000, a majority of Riverkeeper&#x27;s board sided with Kennedy when he insisted on rehiring William Wegner, a wildlife lecturer and falcon trainer whom the organization&#x27;s founder and president, Robert H. Boyle, had fired six months earlier after learning that Wegner had been convicted in 1995 for tax fraud, perjury, and conspiracy to violate wildlife protection laws. Wegner had recruited and led a team of at least 10 who smuggled cockatoo eggs, including species considered endangered by Australia, from Australia to the U.S. over a period of eight years. He served 3.5 years of a five-year sentence and was hired by Kennedy a few months after his release. After the board&#x27;s decision, Boyle, eight of the 22 members of the board, and Riverkeeper&#x27;s treasurer resigned, saying it was not right for an environmental organization to hire someone convicted of environmental crimes and that it would hurt the organization&#x27;s fundraising.

While working with Riverkeeper, Kennedy spearheaded a 34-year battle to close the Indian Point nuclear-power plant. Kennedy was featured in a 2004 documentary about the plant, &quot;Indian Point: Imagining the Unimaginable&quot;, directed by his sister, the documentary filmmaker Rory Kennedy. In 2017, Kennedy argued that the electricity Indian Point provided could be fully replaced by renewable energy. In 2022, after the plant&#x27;s closure, carbon emissions from electricity generation in New York state increased by 37%, compared to 2019, before the start of the closure.

Kennedy resigned from Riverkeeper in 2017.

===Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic===
In 1987, Kennedy founded the Environmental Litigation Clinic at Pace University School of Law, where for three decades he was the clinic&#x27;s supervising attorney and co-director and Clinical Professor of Law. Kennedy obtained a special order from the New York State Court of Appeals that permitted his 10 clinic students to practice law and try cases against Hudson River polluters in state and federal court, under the supervision of Kennedy and his co-director, Professor Karl Coplan. The clinic&#x27;s full-time clients are Riverkeeper and Long Island Soundkeeper.

The clinic has sued governments and companies for polluting Long Island Sound and the Hudson River and its tributaries. It argued cases to expand citizen access to the shoreline and won hundreds of settlements for the Hudson Riverkeeper. Kennedy and his students also sued dozens of municipal wastewater treatment plants to force compliance with the Clean Water Act. In 2010, a Pace lawsuit forced ExxonMobil to clean up tens of millions of gallons of oil from legacy refinery spills in Newtown Creek in Brooklyn.

On April 11, 2001, &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; gave Kennedy its &quot;Heroes&quot; Award for creating the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic. Kennedy and the clinic received other awards for successful legal work cleaning up the environment. The Pace Clinic became a model for similar environmental law clinics throughout the country.

===Waterkeeper Alliance===
In June 1999, as Riverkeeper&#x27;s success on the Hudson began inspiring the creation of Waterkeepers across North America, Kennedy and a few dozen Riverkeepers gathered in Southampton, Long Island, to found the Waterkeeper Alliance, which is now the umbrella group for the 344 licensed Waterkeeper programs in 44 countries. As president, Kennedy oversaw its legal, membership, policy and fundraising programs. The Alliance is dedicated to promoting &quot;swimmable, fishable, drinkable waterways, worldwide&quot;.

Under Kennedy&#x27;s leadership, Waterkeeper launched its &quot;Clean Coal is a Deadly Lie&quot; campaign in 2001, bringing dozens of lawsuits targeting mining practices, including mountaintop removal and slurry pond construction, as well as coal-burning utilities&#x27; mercury emissions and coal ash piles. Kennedy&#x27;s Waterkeeper alliance has also been fighting coal export, including from terminals in the Pacific Northwest.

Waterkeeper waged a legal and public relations battle against pollution from factory farms. In the 1990s, Kennedy rallied opposition to factory farms among small independent farmers, convened a series of &quot;National Summits&quot; on factory meat products, and conducted press conference whistle-stop tours across North Carolina, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, and in Washington, D.C. Beginning in 2000, Kennedy sued factory farms in North Carolina, Oklahoma, Maryland, and Iowa. In a 2003 article, he argued factory farms produce lower-quality, less healthy food, and harm independent family farmers by poisoning their air and water, reducing their property values, and using extensive state and federal subsidies to impose unfair competition against them.

Kennedy and his environmental work have been the focus of several films, including &quot;The Waterkeepers&quot; (2000), directed by Les Guthman. In 2008, he appeared in the IMAX documentary film &quot;Grand Canyon Adventure: River at Risk&quot;, riding the Grand Canyon in a wooden dory with his daughter Kick and anthropologist Wade Davis.

Kennedy resigned the Waterkeeper Alliance presidency in November 2020.

===New York City Watershed Agreement===
Beginning in 1991, Kennedy represented environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers in a series of lawsuits against New York City and upstate watershed polluters. Kennedy authored a series of articles and reports alleging that New York State was abdicating its responsibility to protect the water repository and supply. In 1996, he helped orchestrate the $1.2 billion New York City Watershed Agreement, which &quot;New York&quot; magazine recognized in its cover story, &quot;The Kennedy Who Matters&quot;. This agreement, which Kennedy negotiated on behalf of environmentalists and New York City watershed consumers, is regarded as an international model in stakeholder consensus negotiations and sustainable development.

===Kennedy &amp; Madonna LLP===
In 2000, Kennedy and the environmental lawyer Kevin Madonna founded the environmental law firm Kennedy &amp; Madonna, LLP, to represent private plaintiffs against polluters. The firm litigates environmental contamination cases on behalf of individuals, non-profit organizations, school districts, public water suppliers, Indian tribes, municipalities and states. In 2001, Kennedy &amp; Madonna organized a team of prestigious plaintiff law firms to challenge pollution from industrial pork and poultry production. In 2004, the firm was part of a legal team that secured a $70 million settlement for property owners in Pensacola, Florida whose properties were contaminated by chemicals from an adjacent Superfund site.

Kennedy &amp; Madonna was profiled in the 2010 HBO documentary &quot;Mann v. Ford&quot;, which chronicles four years of litigation by the firm on behalf of the Ramapough Mountain Indians against the Ford Motor Company for dumping toxic waste on tribal lands in northern New Jersey. In addition to a monetary settlement for the tribe, the lawsuit contributed to the community&#x27;s land being relisted on the federal Superfund list, the first time that a delisted site was relisted.

In 2007, Kennedy was one of three finalists nominated by Public Justice as &quot;Trial Lawyer of the Year&quot; for his role in the $396 million jury verdict against DuPont for contamination from its Spelter, West Virginia, zinc plant. In 2017, the firm was part of the trial team that secured a $670 million settlement on behalf of over 3,000 residents from Ohio and West Virginia whose drinking water was contaminated by the toxic chemical perfluorooctanoic acid, which DuPont released into the environment in Parkersburg, West Virginia.

===Morgan &amp; Morgan===
In 2016, Kennedy became counsel to the Morgan &amp; Morgan law firm. The partnership arose from the two firms&#x27; successful collaboration on the case against SoCalGas Company following the Aliso Canyon gas leak in California. In 2017, Kennedy and his partners sued Monsanto in federal court in San Francisco, on behalf of plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma cases that, the plaintiffs allege, were a result of exposure to Monsanto&#x27;s glyphosate-based herbicide, Roundup. Kennedy and his team also filed a class action lawsuit against Monsanto for failing to warn consumers about the dangers allegedly posed by exposure to Roundup.

In September 2018, Kennedy and his partners filed a class-action lawsuit against Columbia Gas of Massachusetts alleging negligence following gas explosions in three towns north of Boston. Of Columbia Gas, Kennedy said &quot;as they build new miles of pipe, the same company is ignoring its existing infrastructure, which we now know is eroding and is dilapidated&quot;.

===Cape Wind===
In 2005, Kennedy clashed with national environmental groups over his opposition to the Cape Wind Project, a proposed offshore wind farm in Cape Cod, Massachusetts (in Nantucket Sound). Taking the side of Cape Cod&#x27;s commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the project was a costly boondoggle. This position angered some environmentalists, and Kennedy was criticized by commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and John Stossel, the latter of whom called him a hypocrite. In &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Kennedy wrote, &quot;Vermont wants to take its nuclear plant off line and replace it with clean, green power from Hydro-Québec—power available to Massachusetts utilities—at a cost of six cents per kilowatt hour (kwh). Cape Wind electricity, by a conservative estimate and based on figures they filed with the state, comes in at 25 cents per kwh.&quot;

===Other ventures===
In 1999, Kennedy, Chris Bartle and John Hoving created a bottled water company, Keeper Springs, which donated all of its profits to Waterkeeper Alliance.

Kennedy was a venture partner and senior advisor at VantagePoint Capital Partners, one of the world&#x27;s largest cleantech venture capital firms. Among other activities, VantagePoint was the original and largest pre-IPO institutional investor in Tesla, Inc. VantagePoint also backed BrightSource Energy and Solazyme, amongst others. Kennedy is a board member and counselor to several of Vantage Point&#x27;s portfolio companies in the water and energy space, including Ostara, a Vancouver-based company that markets the technology to remove phosphorus and other excessive nutrients from wastewater, transforming otherwise pollution directly into high-grade fertilizer. He is also a senior advisor to Starwood Energy Group and has played a key role in a number of the firm&#x27;s investments.

He is on the board of Vionx, a Massachusetts-based utility-scale vanadium flow battery systems manufacturer. On October 5, 2017, Vionx, National Grid and the U.S. Department of Energy completed the installation of advanced flow batteries at Holy Name High School in the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. The collaboration also includes Siemens and the United Technologies Research Center and constitutes one of the largest energy storage facilities in Massachusetts.

Kennedy helped found and served on the board of the New York League of Conservation Voters.

Kennedy is a partner in ColorZen, which offers a turnkey-cotton-fiber pre-treatment solution that reduces water usage and toxic discharges in the cotton-dyeing process.

Kennedy was a co-owner and director of the smart-grid company Utility Integration Solutions (UISol), which was acquired by Alstom. He is presently a co-owner and director of GridBright, the market-leading grid management specialist.

In October 2011, Kennedy co-founded &quot;EcoWatch&quot;, an environmental news site. He resigned from its board of directors in January 2018.

===Minority and poor communities===
In his first case as an environmental attorney, Kennedy represented the NAACP in a lawsuit against a proposal to build a garbage transfer station in a minority neighborhood in Ossining, New York. In 1987, he successfully sued Westchester County to reopen the Croton Point Park, which was primarily used by poor and minority communities from the Bronx. He then forced the reopening of the Pelham Bay Park, which New York City had closed to the public and converted to a police firing range.

===International and indigenous rights===

Starting in 1985, Kennedy helped develop the international program for environmental, energy, and human rights of the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), traveling to Canada and Latin America to assist indigenous tribes in protecting their homelands and opposing large-scale energy and extractive projects in remote wilderness areas.

In 1990, Kennedy assisted indigenous Pehuenches in Chile in a partially successful campaign to stop the construction of a series of dams on Chile&#x27;s iconic Biobío River. That campaign derailed all but one of the proposed dams. Beginning in 1992, he assisted the Cree Indians of northern Quebec in their campaign against Hydro-Québec to halt construction of some 600 proposed dams on eleven rivers in James Bay.

In 1993, Kennedy and NRDC, working with the indigenous rights organization Cultural Survival, clashed with other American environmental groups in a dispute about the rights of Indians to govern their own lands in the Oriente region of Ecuador. Kennedy represented the CONFENIAE, a confederation of Indian peoples, in negotiation with the American oil company Conoco to limit oil development in Ecuadorian Amazon and, at the same time, obtain benefits from resource extraction for Amazonian tribes. Kennedy was a vocal critic of Texaco for its previous record for polluting the Ecuadoran Amazon.

From 1993 to 1999, Kennedy worked with five Vancouver Island Indian tribes in their campaign to end industrial logging by MacMillan Bloedel in Clayoquot Sound, British Columbia. In 1996, he met with Cuban president Fidel Castro to persuade him to halt his plans to construct a nuclear power plant at Juraguá. During the meeting, Castro reminisced about Kennedy&#x27;s father and uncle, speculating that U.S. relations with Cuba would have been far better had President Kennedy not been assassinated. Between 1996 and 2000, Kennedy and the NRDC helped Mexican commercial fishermen halt Mitsubishi&#x27;s proposal to build a salt facility in the Laguna San Ignacio, an area in Baja where gray whales breed and nurse their calves. Kennedy wrote in opposition to the project, and took the campaign to Japan, meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. In 2000, he assisted local environmental activists to stop Chaffin Light, a real estate developer, and U.S. engineering giant Bechtel from building a large hotel and resort development that, Kennedy argued, threatened coral reefs and public beaches used by local Bahamians, at Clifton Bay, New Providence Island.

Kennedy was one of the early editors of &quot;Indian Country Today&quot;, North America&#x27;s largest Native American newspaper. He helped lead the opposition to the damming of the Futaleufú River in the Southern Zone of Chile. In 2016, due to the pressure precipitated by the Futaleufú Riverkeepers campaign against the dams, the Spanish power company Endesa, which owned the right to dam the river, reversed its decision and relinquished all claims to the Futaleufú.

===Military and Vieques===
Kennedy has been a critic of environmental damage by the U.S. military.

In a 2001 article, Kennedy described how he sued the U.S. Navy on behalf of fishermen and residents of Vieques, an island of Puerto Rico, to stop weapons testing, bombing, and other military exercises. Kennedy argued that the activities were unnecessary, and that the Navy had illegally destroyed several endangered species, polluted the island&#x27;s waters, harmed the residents&#x27; health, and damaged its economy. He was arrested for trespassing at Camp Garcia Vieques, the U.S. Navy training facility, where he and others were protesting the use of a section of the island for training. Kennedy served 30 days in a maximum security prison in Puerto Rico. The trespassing incident forced the suspension of live-fire exercises for almost three hours. The lawsuits and protests by Kennedy, and hundreds of Puerto Ricans who were also imprisoned, eventually forced the termination of naval bombing in Vieques by the Bush administration.

In a 2003 article for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Kennedy called the U.S. federal government &quot;America&#x27;s biggest polluter&quot; and the U.S. Department of Defense the worst offender. Citing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), he wrote, &quot;unexploded ordnance waste can be found on 16,000 military ranges...and more than half may contain biological or chemical weapons.&quot;

==Political aspirations==
=== Candidacy aspirations ===
Kennedy considered running for political office in 2000 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a U.S. senator from New York, did not seek reelection to the seat formerly held by Kennedy&#x27;s father.

In 2005, Kennedy considered running for New York attorney general in the 2006 election, which would have put him up against his then-brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo, but he ultimately chose not to, despite being considered the front-runner.

On December 2, 2008, Kennedy said he did not want New York Governor David Paterson to nominate him to the U.S. Senate seat to be vacated by Hillary Clinton, Obama&#x27;s nominee for Secretary of State. Some outlets indicated that Kennedy was a possible candidate for the position. He said that Senate service would leave him too little time with his family.

=== 2000s consideration for top environmental jobs ===
As a &quot;well-respected climate lawyer&quot; in the 2000s, Kennedy was &quot;often linked to top environmental jobs in Democratic administrations&quot;, including in the 2000, 2004, and 2008 presidential elections. He was considered as a potential chair of the White House Council on Environmental Quality for Al Gore in 2000 and considered for the role of EPA administrator under John Kerry in 2004 and Barack Obama in 2008.

According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the Obama transition team decided not to nominate Kennedy due to his past heroin conviction and opposition from Senate Republicans. Then United States Chamber of Commerce lobbyist William Kovacs said that Kennedy&#x27;s nomination &quot;would speak volumes as to where Obama is going with his appointments... A Kennedy appointment is as liberal as you can possibly get... There is no one [candidate] based firmer in extremes.&quot; Republican Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma also criticized the proposal, saying Kennedy was too radical and would further a left-wing agenda if appointed.

===2024 presidential campaign===

In a speech in New Hampshire on March 3, 2023, Kennedy said he was considering a run for president in 2024: &quot;I am thinking about it. I&#x27;ve passed the biggest hurdle, which is that my wife has greenlighted it.&quot;

Kennedy filed his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination on April 5, 2023. He formally declared his candidacy at a campaign launch event at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston on April 19. On October 9, he became an independent candidate in the election. He is the fifth member of his family to seek the presidency.

Listing many false conspiracy theories that Kennedy used during campaign appearances, PolitiFact named his presidential campaign its 2023 &quot;lie of the year&quot;.

In May 2024, Kennedy was considered for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s nomination for president, but lost to Chase Oliver. In Colorado, the state Libertarian Party selected Kennedy, but Oliver appeared on the ballot as the Libertarian nominee.

Kennedy&#x27;s campaign was noted for receiving significant support from Republican donors and Trump allies who believed he would serve as a &quot;spoiler&quot;, taking the votes of those who would have otherwise voted for the Democratic nominee. In August 2023, it was revealed that Timothy Mellon, who gave $15 million to Donald Trump&#x27;s super PAC MAGA Inc., also donated $5 million to Kennedy&#x27;s super PAC, making him Kennedy&#x27;s largest single donor. Mellon donated another $5 million to Kennedy&#x27;s super PAC in April and another $50 million to MAGA Inc. in May. In July 2024, Forbes reported that Mellon had donated $25 million to Kennedy and Kennedy-affiliated groups.

In August, facing declining poll numbers, limited campaign funds, and increasing challenges to ballot access, the Kennedy campaign began appealing to the Harris and Trump campaigns, seeking a cabinet post in exchange for an endorsement. Harris reportedly rebuffed Kennedy, but Trump said he &quot;probably would [consider the offer], if something like that would happen&quot;. On August 22, the Kennedy campaign filed to be removed from the Arizona ballot amid reports he would drop out to endorse Trump.
On August 23, Kennedy dropped out and endorsed Trump, saying he intended to maintain ballot placement in certain non-swing states. This was a reversal for Kennedy, who had previously said he would &quot;under no circumstances&quot; join Trump on a presidential ticket, that his and Trump&#x27;s positions &quot;could not be further apart&quot;, and that Trump was a &quot;terrible human being&quot;, a &quot;discredit to democracy&quot;, and &quot;probably a sociopath&quot;. In his speech endorsing Trump, Kennedy described speaking with Trump and his advisers and said he discovered that he and Trump were &quot;aligned on many key issues&quot;.

==Secretary of Health and Human Services (2025–present)==
=== Nomination and confirmation ===
Days before the 2024 United States presidential election, Donald Trump said that Kennedy would have &quot;a big role in health care&quot;. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Kennedy&#x27;s position was not originally meant to be one requiring Senate confirmation. On November 14, after winning the election, Trump announced his intention to nominate Kennedy for secretary of health and human services (HHS).

==== Criticism ====
In December 2024, more than 75 Nobel Laureates urged the U.S. Senate to oppose Kennedy&#x27;s nomination, saying he would &quot;put the public&#x27;s health in jeopardy&quot;.

During the week of December 16, 2024, Kennedy began meeting with senators in advance of his confirmation hearings.

As of January 9, 2025, over 17,000 doctors who are members of Committee to Protect Health Care, had signed an open letter urging the Senate to oppose Kennedy&#x27;s nomination, arguing that Kennedy had spent decades undermining public confidence in vaccines and spreading false claims and conspiracy theories, that he was a danger to national healthcare, and that he was unqualified to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, said putting Kennedy in charge of a health agency would be like &quot;putting a flat earther in charge of NASA&quot;. As of January 24, 2025, more than 80 organizations had voiced opposition to Kennedy&#x27;s nomination.

==== Senate nomination hearings ====
In January 2025, the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP) held hearings on Kennedy&#x27;s nomination. Senator Bernie Sanders, the committee&#x27;s ranking member, was critical of Kennedy during the hearing. 

==== Conflicts of interest disclosure statement ====
Kennedy disclosed to an HHS ethics official his arrangement with a law firm specializing in pharmaceutical drug injury cases, Wisner Baum, whereby Kennedy earns 10% of fees awarded in contingency cases that he refers to the firm. If confirmed as HHS director, Kennedy would retain the arrangement only in cases that do not directly affect the federal government. He listed his income from Wisner Baum for this arrangement as $856,559. Before assuming the position of director of HHS, he will have from the law firm the complete and final payments for concluded cases against the U.S. government. He added that will assign his son his interests in litigation against the maker of Gardasil, a vaccine given to prevent cervical cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).

==== Committee votes ====
On February 4, 2025, the Senate Committee on Finance voted 14–13 to forward Kennedy&#x27;s nomination to a full Senate vote. The deciding vote was from Bill Cassidy, who was originally hesitant, but said he had received &quot;serious commitments&quot; from the Trump administration and &quot;honest counsel&quot; from Vice President JD Vance in exchange for his support of Kennedy&#x27;s nomination. According to the Senate HELP Committee site, Cassidy said that he was a doctor who had practiced for 30 years before becoming a politician. He told the committee that he had a patient with acute hepatitis B who needed a liver transplant and had to be transported by Medi-vac. He called the transplant &quot;an invasive, quarter-of-a-million-dollar surgery—in 2000—that, even if successful, would leave this young woman with a lifetime of $50,000 per year medical bills&quot;, adding, &quot;As I saw her take off, I was so depressed. A $50 of vaccine could have prevented this all&quot;. 

Of the two committees that Kennedy spoke before, only the Senate Finance was to vote on his nomination.

==== Confirmation vote ====
On February 13, 2025, the Senate confirmed Kennedy as Secretary of Health and Human Services by a vote of 52 to 48, with former Senate Republican Conference leader Mitch McConnell the sole Republican to vote against him. A polio survivor, McConnell was critical of efforts to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. He said, &quot;anyone seeking the Senate&#x27;s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts&quot;.

=== Tenure ===
On February 13, 2025, Kennedy was sworn in as the 26th secretary of health and human services in the Oval Office by Justice Neil Gorsuch. He is the first independent or third-party presidential candidate to become a cabinet member after running for president.

Minutes later, Trump signed Executive Order 14211, which ordered the creation of a &quot;Make America Healthy Again&quot; (MAHA) Commission to be chaired by Kennedy. Its objectives include investigating the incidence and causes of chronic childhood diseases and &quot;assess[ing] the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs&quot;.

The next morning, agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were informed that approximately 5,200 newly hired federal health workers were to be fired that day.

On February 20, 2025, in the midst of an unusually severe influenza season, the CDC was instructed by HHS to suspend their ad campaign promoting flu vaccination. The advertising, in part a response to declining flu vaccination rates, promoted the message that vaccination would result in much milder symptoms and lower chances of becoming severely ill in the event one caught the flu.

==== 2025 Southwest United States measles outbreak ====
Kennedy&#x27;s tenure began during a measles outbreak in the Southwest United States, including the first measles death in a decade. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 146 cases, twenty hospitalizations, and one death in late February. When asked about the outbreak, Kennedy said there had been two deaths, and that “there have been four measles outbreaks this year. In this country last year there were 16. So, it’s not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.” Kennedy also falsely claimed that the people hospitalized were done so “mainly for quarantine,&quot; a claim that was refuted by healthcare professionals.

==Anti-vaccine advocacy and conspiracy theories on public health==
Kennedy is a prominent voice in the anti-vaccine movement, spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda. The infectious disease specialist Michael Osterholm has said that Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;anti-vaccine disinformation&quot; is effective &quot;because it&#x27;s portrayed to the public with graphs and figures and what appears to be scientific data. He has perfected the art of illusion of fact.&quot; Osterholm added:This is about people&#x27;s lives. And the consequences of promoting this kind of disinformation, as credible as it may seem, is simply dangerous.Kennedy has said that he is not against vaccines but wants them to be more thoroughly tested and investigated. In &quot;Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak&quot; (2015), he writes that he does not see himself as anti-vaccine: &quot;People who advocate for safer vaccines should not be marginalized or denounced as anti-vaccine. I am pro-vaccine. I had all six of my children vaccinated. I believe that vaccines have saved the lives of hundreds of millions of humans over the past century and that broad vaccine coverage is critical to public health. But I want our vaccines to be as safe as possible.&quot; But in July 2023, Kennedy said, &quot;There&#x27;s no vaccine that is safe and effective.&quot;

In January 2024, Kennedy published a podcast about Lyme disease in which he said it is &quot;highly likely to have been a military weapon&quot; developed at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. Multiple experts and authoritative sources have debunked the charge and called it &quot;absurd&quot;.

=== Vaccines and autism claims ===
Kennedy chaired the Children&#x27;s Health Defense (formerly known as the World Mercury Project), an anti-vaccine advocacy group he joined in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith_12/15/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In its early years, the group focused on mercury in industry and medicine, especially the ethylmercury used in thimerosal in vaccines. The group alleges that exposure to certain chemicals and radiation has caused a wide range of conditions in many American children, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Children&#x27;s Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, and wireless communication, among other things. The group has been identified as one of two major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in late 2018 and early 2019. Members of his family have criticized Kennedy and his organization, saying he spreads &quot;dangerous misinformation&quot; and that his work has &quot;heartbreaking&quot; consequences.

Kennedy and Children&#x27;s Health Defense have falsely claimed that vaccines cause autism. Kennedy focused on the subset of vaccines that contained thimerosal, a mercury-based anti-microbial that has been falsely claimed to cause autism. Thimerosal has never been used in MMR, chickenpox, pneumococcal conjugate, or inactivated polio vaccines, and in 2001 was removed from all other childhood (under 6 years old) vaccines except for a few versions of flu and hepatitis vaccines. No childhood vaccine now contains more than traces (1 microgram or less) of thimerosal, except for flu, which is also available without thimerosal in the U.S. For those 6 years and older, including pregnant women, all vaccines are now available in versions with only trace amounts of thimerosal.

In April 2015, Kennedy participated in a Speakers&#x27; Forum to promote the film &quot;Trace Amounts&quot;, which promotes the discredited claim of a link between autism and mercury in vaccinations. At a screening, he called the increased cases of autism (which he calls an &quot;autism epidemic&quot;) a &quot;holocaust&quot;.

In 2020, the Center for Countering Digital Hate said that Kennedy uses his status as an environmental activist to bolster the anti-vaccination movement, regularly appearing in online conversations with the discredited British former doctor Andrew Wakefield, the anti-vaccination activist Del Bigtree, and the conspiracy theorist Rashid Buttar. Kennedy is listed as executive producer of &quot;Vaxxed II: The People&#x27;s Truth&quot;, the 2019 sequel to Wakefield&#x27;s and Bigtree&#x27;s anti-vaccination propaganda film &quot;Vaxxed&quot;.

In February 2021, Kennedy&#x27;s Instagram account was deleted &quot;for repeatedly sharing debunked claims&quot; about COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_2/11/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2021, the Center for Countering Digital Hate identified Kennedy as one of 12 people responsible for up to 65% of anti-vaccine content on Facebook and Twitter.

Kennedy has said that governments and the media are conspiring to deny that vaccines cause autism.

==== Writings and speeches promoting anti-vaccine theories ====
In June 2005, Kennedy wrote an article, &quot;Deadly Immunity&quot;, that appeared in both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Salon.com&quot; and alleged a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The article contained factual errors, leading &quot;Salon&quot; to issue five corrections. Joan Walsh, &quot;Salon.com&quot;″s editor-in-chief at the time and the sole &quot;Salon&quot; editor of the piece, said she had mistakenly relied on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s fact-checking, a process she later learned was &quot;less than arduous&quot;. As soon as the piece was up, she said, &quot;We were besieged by scientists and advocates showing how Kennedy had misunderstood, incorrectly cited, and perhaps even falsified data... It was the worst mistake of my career. I probably should have been fired.&quot;

Six years later &quot;Salon.com&quot; retracted the article in its entirety. It said the retraction was motivated by accumulating evidence of alleged errors and scientific fraud underlying the vaccine-autism claim. A corrected version of the original article was published on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s website. Kennedy said on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;—and was paraphrased in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as saying—that &quot;&quot;Salon&quot; caved to pressure from government regulators and the pharmaceutical industry.&quot; Walsh responded: &quot;That&#x27;s just another lie. We caved to pressure from the incontrovertible truth and our journalistic consciences.&quot;

In May 2013, Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the anti-vaccination AutismOne / Generation Rescue conference.

In 2014, Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak: The Evidence Supporting the Immediate Removal of Mercurya Known Neurotoxinfrom Vaccines&quot;, was published.
While methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin, thimerosal is not. According to the CDC, there is &quot;no convincing evidence of harm caused by the low doses of thimerosal in vaccines&quot;. The book&#x27;s preface is by Mark Hyman, a proponent of the alternative medical treatment called functional medicine. Kennedy has published many articles on the inclusion of thimerosal in vaccines.

==== Meeting with Donald Trump ====
On January 10, 2017, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump administration. Kennedy said afterward that he had accepted an offer from Trump to chair the Vaccine Safety Task Force, but a spokeswoman for Trump&#x27;s transition said that no final decision had been made. In an August 2017 interview with &quot;STAT News&quot; reporter Helen Branswell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with federal public health regulators at the White House&#x27;s request to discuss defects in vaccine safety science.

==== Controversy with Robert De Niro ====
On February 15, 2017, Kennedy and the actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which they said the press was working for the vaccination industry and did not allow debates on vaccination science. They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines. Craig Foster, a psychology professor who studies pseudoscience, deemed the challenge &quot;not science&quot;, calling it a &quot;carefully constructed &#x27;contest&#x27; that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see&quot;. Foster added, &quot;Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful.&quot;

==== Samoa measles outbreak ====
On June 4, 2019, during a visit to Samoa coinciding with its 57th annual independence celebration, Kennedy appeared in an Instagram photo with Australian-Samoan anti-vaccine activist Taylor Winterstein. Kennedy&#x27;s charity and Winterstein have both perpetuated the allegation that the MMR vaccine played a role in the 2018 deaths of two Samoan infants, despite the subsequent revelation that the infants had mistakenly received a muscle relaxant along with the vaccine. Kennedy has drawn criticism for fueling vaccine hesitancy amid a social climate that gave rise to the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, which killed over 70 people, and the 2019 Tonga measles outbreak.

==== Texas and New Mexico measles outbreak ====
In February 2025, an outbreak in West Texas resulted in a child&#x27;s death. It was only the second such U.S. fatality since 2003, and was diagnosed in over 100 individuals, with 20 hospitalized by February 26th. Such outbreaks of the disease had been declared domestically eliminated. Oregon U.S. Senator Ron Wyden wrote, “Nothing about kids dying from measles is normal.” “Anti-vaxxers like RFK Jr. and the Republicans who enable them are responsible for every single one of these deaths.”

=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy promoted multiple conspiracy theories related to COVID, including false claims that Anthony Fauci and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation were trying to profit off a vaccine, and suggesting that Bill Gates would cut off access to money of people who do not get vaccinated, allowing them to starve. In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with Alec Baldwin on Instagram and touted a number of incorrect and misleading claims about vaccines and public health measures related to the pandemic. Public health officials and scientists criticized Baldwin for letting Kennedy&#x27;s claims go unchallenged.

In May 2021, Kennedy petitioned the FDA to rescind authorization for all current and future COVID vaccines. The vaccines had saved about 140,000 lives in the United States. John Moore, a professor of immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, called Kennedy&#x27;s request &quot;an appalling error of judgment&quot;.

Kennedy has promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine, falsely suggesting that it contributed to the death of Hank Aaron and others. In February 2021, his Instagram account was blocked for &quot;repeatedly sharing debunked claims about the coronavirus or vaccines&quot;. The Center for Countering Digital Hate identified Kennedy as one of the main propagators of conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and 5G phone technology. His conspiracy theory activities considerably increased his social media impact; between the spring and fall of 2020, his Instagram account grew from 121,000 followers to 454,000.

Kennedy has expressed skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic, contending that it served to benefit billionaires. According to Kennedy, the pandemic resulted in a &quot;$4.4 trillion shift in wealth from the American middle class to this new oligarchy that we created—500 new billionaires with the lockdowns, and the billionaires that we already had increased their wealth by 30%&quot;.

In November 2021, Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health&quot; was published. In it, Kennedy alleges that Fauci sabotaged treatments for AIDS, violated federal laws, and conspired with Bill Gates and social media companies such as Facebook to suppress information about COVID-19 cures, to leave vaccines as the only option to fight the pandemic. In the book, Kennedy calls Fauci a &quot;powerful technocrat who helped orchestrate and execute 2020&#x27;s historic coup d&#x27;état against Western democracy&quot;. He claims without proof that Fauci and Gates had schemed to prolong the pandemic and exaggerate its effects, promoting expensive vaccinations for the benefit of &quot;a powerful vaccine cartel&quot;. The book repeats several discredited myths about the COVID-19 pandemic, notably about the effectiveness of ivermectin. The &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot; wrote that in the book &quot;polemics alternate with chapters that pedantically seek to substantiate Kennedy&#x27;s accusations with numerous quotations and studies&quot;. Kennedy also released a video depicting Fauci with a Hitler mustache. In response to the book, Fauci called Kennedy &quot;a very disturbed individual&quot; and has publicly said that, having met with Kennedy to discuss vaccines early during his tenure in the Trump administration, he &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] know what&#x27;s going on in [Kennedy&#x27;s] head, but it&#x27;s not good&quot;.

Kennedy wrote the foreword to &quot;Plague of Corruption&quot;, a 2020 book by the former research scientist and the anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Judy Mikovits.

On August 29, 2020, Kennedy appeared as a speaker at a partially violent demonstration in Berlin where populist groups called for an end to restrictions caused by COVID-19. His YouTube account was removed in late September 2021 for breaking the company&#x27;s new policies on vaccine misinformation.

During a speech on January 23, 2022, at an anti-vaccination rally on the National Mall in Washington D.C., Kennedy said: &quot;Even in Hitler&#x27;s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you could hide in the attic like Anne Frank did. Today the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, none of us can hide.&quot; The Auschwitz Memorial responded on Twitter: &quot;Exploiting of the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured &amp; murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany—including children like Anne Frank—in a debate about vaccines &amp; limitations during global pandemic is a sad symptom of moral &amp; intellectual decay.&quot; Kennedy&#x27;s wife, the actress Cheryl Hines, also condemned his comments, tweeting that the reference to Frank was &quot;reprehensible and insensitive&quot;. Two days later, Kennedy apologized for his comment. In June 2023, Instagram reinstated his account.

At a private dinner in July 2023, Kennedy was recorded saying, &quot;There is an argument that [COVID-19] is ethnically targeted&quot;, adding, &quot;COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are the most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese ... we don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s deliberately targeted or not.&quot; The American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League immediately condemned his remarks, with the latter saying that Kennedy&#x27;s statement &quot;feeds into sinophobic and antisemitic conspiracy theories&quot;. Kennedy responded that he &quot;never, ever suggested that the COVID-19 virus was targeted to spare Jews&quot; and that he does not &quot;believe and never implied that the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered&quot;. He explained his remarks by citing a 2021 study that he said showed that &quot;COVID-19 appears to disproportionately affect certain races&quot; due to racial differences in the effectiveness of COVID-19&#x27;s furin cleave docking site, thus serving &quot;as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons&quot;. Experts roundly criticized these further claims, pointing out that the study said nothing about Chinese people or bioweapons and that Chinese people and Ashkenazi Jews contract COVID-19 at rates similar to other ethnic groups and nationalities. The virologist Angela Rasmussen said, &quot;Jewish or Chinese protease consensus sequences are not a thing in biochemistry, but they are in racism and antisemitism.&quot;

=== Medical racism conspiracy theory ===

Kennedy targets Black Americans with anti-vaccine propaganda and conspiracy theories, linking vaccination with instances of medical racism such as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study. Echoing others in the anti-vaccination movement, Children&#x27;s Health Defense claimed that the U.S. government seeks to harm ethnic minorities by prioritizing them for COVID-19 vaccines. In March 2021, Children&#x27;s Health Defense released an anti-vaccine propaganda video, &quot;Medical Racism: The New Apartheid&quot;, that promotes COVID-19 conspiracy theories and claims that COVID-19 vaccination efforts are medical experiments on Black people. Kennedy appears in the video, inviting viewers to disregard information dispensed by health authorities and doctors. Brandi Collin-Dexter, a Fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said, &quot;the notorious figures and false narratives in the documentary were recognizable&quot; and &quot;the film&#x27;s incompatible narratives sought to take advantage of the pain felt by Black communities.&quot; At the urging of disinformation experts, the film was removed from Facebook, but Kennedy was permitted to keep his account.

=== HIV/AIDS denialism ===
In his book &quot;The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the War on Democracy and Public Health&quot;, Kennedy writes that he takes &quot;no position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS&quot;, but spends over 100 pages quoting HIV denialists such as Peter Duesberg who question the isolation of HIV and the etiology of AIDS. Kennedy refers to the &quot;orthodoxy that HIV alone causes AIDS&quot; and the &quot;theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS&quot;, and repeats the false HIV/AIDS denialist claim that no one has isolated the HIV virion and &quot;No one has been able to point to a study that demonstrates their hypothesis using accepted scientific proofs.&quot; He also repeats the false claim that the early AIDS drug AZT is &quot;absolutely fatal&quot; due to its &quot;horrendous toxicity&quot;. Molecular biologist Dan Wilson points out that Kennedy falsely claims that Luc Montagnier, the discoverer of HIV, was a &quot;convert&quot; to Duesberg&#x27;s fringe hypothesis. Wilson concludes that Kennedy is a &quot;full blown&quot; HIV/AIDS denialist. Epidemiologist Tara C. Smith suggests that Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;even flirts with outright germ theory denial&quot;, quoting from a portion in which Kennedy contrasts the germ theory of disease with terrain theory and another in which he writes that Louis Pasteur &quot;is said to have recanted&quot; germ theory on his deathbed in favor of Antoine Béchamp&#x27;s terrain theory, an unproven claim that circulates among germ theory denialists.

=== Pushback from the Kennedy family ===
Several members of Kennedy&#x27;s close family have distanced themselves from his anti-vaccination activities and conspiracy theories on public health, and condemned his comments equating public health measures with Nazi war crimes. On May 8, 2019, his niece Maeve Kennedy McKean and elder siblings Kathleen and Joseph wrote an open letter saying that while Kennedy has championed many admirable causes, he &quot;has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines&quot;. They also cited the roles played by President John F. Kennedy and Senator Ted Kennedy in (respectively) signing and reauthorizing the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962. On December 30, 2020, another niece, Kerry Kennedy Meltzer, a physician, wrote a similar open letter, saying that her uncle published misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines&#x27; side effects. John F. Kennedy&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, said her family was generally united in supporting public health infrastructure, citing the work of Ted Kennedy and Eunice Kennedy Shriver. She added, &quot;I think Bobby Kennedy [Jr.]&#x27;s views on vaccines are dangerous, but I don&#x27;t think that most Americans share them, so we&#x27;ll just have to wait and see what happens.&quot; On January 28, 2025, Caroline Kennedy publicly denounced Bobby Kennedy in a letter she sent U.S. senators and in a video of her reading the letter, calling him a &quot;predator&quot; and a &quot;hypocrite&quot; who was unqualified to be the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. She also accused him of animal cruelty and &quot;encouraging&quot; other family members, such as Bobby&#x27;s brother David Kennedy, into substance abuse that led to addiction, illness, and death. Caroline Kennedy&#x27;s cousin Stephen Smith Jr. said, &quot;I completely support my cousin Caroline&#x27;s view that R. F. K. Jr is unqualified in terms of experience and character for the role of Secty of HHS.&quot;

==Political views==
Kennedy&#x27;s political rhetoric often uses conspiracy theories.

===Economic inequality===
Kennedy has argued that poor communities shoulder a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution. Speaking at the 2016 South by Southwest environment conference, he said, &quot;Polluters always choose the soft target of poverty&quot;, noting that Chicago&#x27;s South Side has the highest concentration of toxic waste dumps in the U.S., and added that 80% of &quot;uncontrolled toxic waste dumps&quot; are in black neighborhoods, with the largest site in Emelle, Alabama, which is 90% black.

Kennedy has said that &quot;systematic&quot; erosion of the middle class is taking place, remarking in a 2023 interview with UnHerd that American politicians have &quot;been systematically hollowing out the American middle class and printing money to make billionaires richer&quot;. He said that the financial industry and the military–industrial complex are funded at the expense of the American middle class; that the U.S. government is dominated by corporate power; the Environmental Protection Agency is run by the &quot;oil industry, the coal industry, and the pesticide industry&quot;; and that the Food and Drug Administration is dominated by &quot;Big Pharma&quot;. Kennedy sees a &quot;vibrant middle class&quot; as the economy&#x27;s backbone and has said that the economy has deteriorated because the middle class has become poorer.

In an interview with Andrew Serwer, Kennedy said that the gap between rich and poor in the U.S. had become too great and that &quot;the very wealthy people should pay more taxes and corporations&quot;. He also expressed support for Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s wealth tax plan, which would impose an annual tax of 2% on every dollar of a household&#x27;s net worth over $50 million and 6% on every dollar of net worth over $1 billion.

===Foreign affairs and military intervention===
Kennedy is critical of the United States&#x27; alliances with dictatorships like Saudi Arabia. He criticized the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war, calling it a &quot;genocide against the Iranian-backed Houthi tribe&quot;. Kennedy is a supporter of Israel. In December 2023, he had a heated exchange with &quot;Breaking Points&quot; host Krystal Ball, in what Rabbi Shmuley Boteach called &quot;the single greatest defense of Israel on videos since the start of the&quot; 2023 Israel–Hamas war.

An opponent of the military industry and foreign interventions, Kennedy was critical of the Iraq War as well as American support for Ukraine against Russia&#x27;s invasion of the country. He condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but called the Russo-Ukrainian War &quot;a U.S. war against Russia&quot; and said the war&#x27;s goal was to &quot;sacrifice the flower of Ukrainian youth in an abattoir of death and destruction for the geopolitical ambition of the neocons&quot;. He called for a peace agreement in Ukraine based on the Minsk Accords; in his view, the Donbas region should remain in Ukraine but also be given territorial autonomy and placed under the jurisdiction of United Nations peacekeeping forces, while Aegis missile systems should be removed from Eastern Europe.

Kennedy said Ukraine should be forbidden from joining NATO, and announced that as president he would consider admitting Russia to NATO and deescalating tensions with China. He said the 2014 Ukrainian revolution was an attempted coup sponsored by the U.S. against the Ukrainian government, and that the Ukrainian government committed atrocities against the Russian population in Donbas, wrongly claiming that all casualties of the Donbas War between 2014 and 2022 (about 14,000) were Russians. He said that Russians living there &quot;were being systematically killed by the Ukrainian government&quot;.

Kennedy denounced the operations of former CIA director Allen Dulles, condemning U.S.-backed coups and interventions such as the 1953 Iranian coup d&#x27;état as &quot;bloodthirsty&quot;, and blamed U.S. interventions in countries such as Syria and Iran for the rise of terrorist organizations such as ISIS and creating anti-American sentiment in the region. Kennedy said the CIA has no accountability and declared his intention to restructure the agency.

Kennedy&#x27;s disapproval of U.S. intervention in foreign governments was expressed in a 1974 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article titled &quot;Poor Chile&quot;, discussing the overthrow of Chilean president Salvador Allende. He also wrote editorials against the execution of Pakistani president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In 1975, he published an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticizing assassination as a foreign policy tool. In 2005, he wrote an article for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; decrying President Bush&#x27;s use of torture as anti-American. His uncle Senator Ted Kennedy entered the article into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;.

In an article titled &quot;Why the Arabs Don&#x27;t Want Us in Syria&quot; published in &quot;Politico&quot; in February 2016, Kennedy referred to the &quot;bloody history that modern interventionists like George W. Bush, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio miss when they recite their narcissistic trope that Mideast nationalists &#x27;hate us for our freedoms.&#x27; For the most part they don&#x27;t; instead they hate us for the way we betrayed those freedoms—our own ideals—within their borders.&quot; Kennedy blames the Syrian war on a pipeline dispute. He cites apparent WikiLeaks disclosures alleging that the CIA led military and intelligence planners to foment a Sunni uprising against Syria&#x27;s president, Bashar al-Assad, following his rejection of a proposed Qatar-Turkey pipeline through Syria in 2009, well before the Arab Spring.

In a June 2023 interview, Kennedy said that in broad terms, he believes that U.S. foreign relations should involve significantly reducing the military presence in other nations. He specifically said the country must &quot;start unraveling the Empire&quot; by closing U.S. bases in different locations worldwide.

Kennedy believes that the administration of President Joe Biden, in large part, caused the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia due to reckless and militant action; he has specifically cited the issue of NATO expansion into Eastern Europe. At the same time, he has clarified that he refuses to connect this criticism with anything considered support of the government of Russia under Putin, particularly given Kennedy&#x27;s ethical opposition to the regime&#x27;s beliefs and politics. He has called Putin a &quot;monster&quot;, a &quot;thug&quot;, and a &quot;gangster&quot;. He also criticized the Trump and Biden administrations&#x27; &quot;provocative policies&quot; in regard to U.S. relations with China, saying that &quot;China does not want a hot war&quot; and calling for a reduction in tensions.

===Environmental policy===
In 2023, Kennedy said he was &quot;arguably the leading environmentalist in the country&quot;. He promotes populist and anti-establishment environmental policies, claiming that &quot;Bill Gates and the World Economic Forum and the billionaire boys&#x27; club in Davos&quot; have hijacked the climate crisis. In a 2015 interview, Kennedy said of politicians skeptical of global warming that he &quot;wished there were a law you could punish them under&quot;. He has said that environmentalists&#x27; priority should be to tackle the &quot;carbon industry&quot;. He has called the current society and economy unsustainable and largely based on a &quot;longtime deadly addiction to coal and oil&quot; and contended that the economic system rewards pollution. In 2020, Kennedy said: &quot;Right now, we have a market that is governed by rules that were written by the carbon incumbents to reward the dirtiest, filthiest, most poisonous, most toxic, most war-mongering fields from hell, rather than the cheap, clean, green, wholesome and patriotic fields from heaven.&quot;

Kennedy has advocated for a global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but has opposed hydropower from dams. He has argued that switching to solar and wind energy reduces costs and greenhouse gases while improving air and water quality, citizens&#x27; health, and the number and quality of jobs. Kennedy&#x27;s fight to stop Appalachian mountaintop removal mining was the subject of the film &quot;The Last Mountain&quot;.

In one of his first environmental cases, Kennedy sued Mobil Oil for polluting the Hudson. He had been an early supporter of natural gas as a viable bridge fuel to renewables and a cleaner alternative to coal, but said he turned against this controversial extraction method after investigating its cost to public health, climate, and road infrastructure. As a member of Governor Andrew Cuomo&#x27;s fracking commission, Kennedy helped engineer a 2013 ban on fracking in New York State.

In 2013, Kennedy assisted the Chipewyan First Nation and the Beaver Lake Cree in fighting to protect their land from tar sands production. In February 2013, while protesting the Keystone XL Pipeline Kennedy, along with his son, Conor, was arrested for blocking a thoroughfare in front of the White House during a protest.

In 2015, Kennedy mounted a national effort against the construction of liquefied natural gas facilities.

In August 2016, Kennedy and Waterkeepers participated in protests to block the extension of the Dakota Access pipeline across the Sioux Indian Standing Rock Reservation&#x27;s water supply.

Kennedy has maintained that the oil industry remains competitive against renewables and electric cars only due to massive direct and indirect subsidies and political interventions on behalf of the oil industry. In a June 2017 interview on &quot;EnviroNews&quot;, he said of the oil industry, &quot;That&#x27;s what their strategy is: build as many miles of pipeline as possible. And what the industry is trying to do is to increase that level of infrastructure investment so our country won&#x27;t be able to walk away from it&quot;.

Kennedy stated his support for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&#x27;s Green New Deal resolution, saying in a 2020 interview, &quot;I think the Green New Deal and all that stuff is important. We ought to be pursuing it. My approach is more market-based than kind of top-down dictates. You know, I believe that we should use market mechanisms like carbon taxes and the elimination of subsidies.&quot;

Kennedy has spoken against geoengineering, saying that geoengineering solutions are an attempt by big business to profit from climate change.

Kennedy has expressed support for regenerative farming, and in May 2023, he voiced support for agrarian movements, saying, &quot;If we want to have democracy, we need a broad ownership of our land by a wide variety of yeoman farmers, each with a stake in our system.&quot; In 1995, Premier Ralph Klein of Alberta declared Kennedy &quot;persona non grata&quot; in the province due to his activism against Alberta&#x27;s large-scale hog production facilities. In 2002, Smithfield Foods sued Kennedy in Poland under a Polish law that makes criticizing a corporation illegal after he denounced the company in a debate with Smithfield&#x27;s Polish director before the Polish parliament.

Kennedy has opposed conventional nuclear power, arguing that it is unsafe and not economically competitive. In June 1981, he spoke at an anti-nuclear rally at the Hollywood Bowl with the musicians Stephen Stills, Bonnie Raitt, and Jackson Browne. He believes nuclear energy is a profit-making venture promoted by corporate lobbyists rather than environmental activists, and has claimed insurance companies are unwilling to insure nuclear plants, saying in a 2023 interview, &quot;It&#x27;s not hippies in tie-dyed T-shirts who are saying it&#x27;s dangerous; it&#x27;s guys on Wall Street with suits and ties.&quot;
Throughout the presidency of George W. Bush, Kennedy was critical of Bush&#x27;s environmental and energy policies, saying Bush was defunding and corrupting federal science projects. Kennedy was also critical of Bush&#x27;s 2003 hydrogen car initiative, arguing that, because of plans to extract the hydrogen from fossil fuels, it was a gift to the fossil fuel industry disguised as a green automobile. In 2003, Kennedy wrote an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about Bush&#x27;s environmental record, which he subsequently expanded into a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling book. His opposition to the Bush administration&#x27;s environmental policies earned him recognition as one of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;100 Agents of Change&quot; on April 2, 2009.

During an October 2012 interview with &quot;Politico&quot;, Kennedy called on environmentalists to direct their dissatisfaction toward Congress rather than President Barack Obama, reasoning that Obama &quot;didn&#x27;t deliver&quot; due to having a partisan Congress &quot;like we haven&#x27;t seen before in American history&quot;. He said politicians who do not act on climate change policy serve special interests and sell out public trust. He said Charles and David Koch—the owners of Koch Industries, Inc., the nation&#x27;s largest privately owned oil company—subverted democracy and made &quot;themselves billionaires by impoverishing the rest of us&quot;. Kennedy has spoken of the Koch brothers as leading &quot;the apocalyptical forces of Ignorance and Greed&quot;. During the 2014 People&#x27;s Climate March, he said: &quot;The Koch brothers have all the money. They&#x27;re putting $300 million this year into their efforts to stop the climate bill. And the only thing we have in our power is people power, and that&#x27;s why we need to put this demonstration on the street.&quot;

In a 2020 interview on Yahoo Finance&#x27;s &quot;Influencers with Andy Serwer&quot;, Kennedy called President Trump&#x27;s environmental policies a &quot;cataclysm&quot; and said Trump is &quot;simply the radical step of a process that&#x27;s been happening in our country and in the Republican Party from the past—really, since 1980—which is a growing hostility towards the environment, a growing orientation to representing the concentrated corporate power and power, particularly of the oil industry and the chemical industry and some of the other large polluting industries.&quot;

===Drug use===
Kennedy has said he intends to create &quot;wellness farms&quot; to rehabilitate illegal drug users, to be paid for from the revenue from taxing the sale of legalized cannabis. The farms&#x27; inmates would grow organic food, without access to computer technology. He has also suggested that the farms might be used to treat people on psychiatric medications: &quot;I’m going to create these wellness farms where they can go to get off of illegal drugs, off of opiates, but also illegal drugs, other psychiatric drugs, if they want to, to get off of SSRIs, to get off of benzos, to get off of Adderall, and to spend time as much time as they need—three or four years if they need it—to learn to get reparented, to reconnect with communities.&quot; Kennedy has said the farms would be compulsory only for illegal drug users.

===Questioning the validity of elections===
Kennedy has been critical of the integrity of the voting process. In June 2006, he published an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; purporting to show that GOP operatives stole the 2004 presidential election for President George W. Bush. Most Democrats and Republicans regarded it as a conspiracy theory. The journalist Farhad Manjoo countered Kennedy&#x27;s conclusions, writing: &quot;If you do read Kennedy&#x27;s article, be prepared to machete your way through numerous errors of interpretation and his deliberate omission of key bits of data.&quot;

Kennedy has written about the ease of election hacking and the dangers of voter purges and voter-identification laws. He wrote the introduction and a chapter in &quot;Billionaires and Ballot Bandits&quot;, a 2012 book on election hacking by the investigative journalist Greg Palast.

===Political endorsements===
Kennedy worked on his uncle Sargent Shriver&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign in Massachusetts, and later was on the national staff and a state coordinator for his uncle Ted Kennedy&#x27;s 1980 presidential campaign.

Kennedy endorsed and campaigned for Vice President Al Gore during his 2000 presidential campaign and openly opposed Ralph Nader&#x27;s Green Party presidential campaign.

In the 2004 presidential election, Kennedy endorsed John Kerry, noting his strong environmental record. After Kerry lost the election to George W. Bush, Kennedy wrote an article for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; falsely claiming that the results were fraudulent and that the election was stolen from Kerry, basing his argument on discrepancies between exit polling and reported results in swing states such as Ohio, as well as voter disenfranchisement.

In late 2007, Kennedy and his sisters Kerry and Kathleen endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries. After the Democratic Convention, Kennedy campaigned for Obama across the country. After the election, the Obama administration was reportedly considering Kennedy for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but felt his controversial statements and arrest for heroin possession in the 1980s made him unlikely to win Senate confirmation.

In 2016, Kennedy called supporters of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump &quot;belligerent idiots&quot; and suggested that some were &quot;outright Nazis&quot;. He has also characterized Trump as a &quot;bully&quot; and a &quot;threat to democracy&quot;, comparing him to Adolf Hitler and George Wallace.

In 2024, Kennedy endorsed Trump for president at a Trump campaign rally in Arizona.

==Other views==

===Food allergies===
Kennedy was a founding board member of the Food Allergy Initiative. His son has anaphylactic peanut allergies. Kennedy wrote the foreword to &quot;The Peanut Allergy Epidemic&quot;, in which he and the authors falsely link increasing food allergies in children to certain vaccines that were approved beginning in 1989.

===Murder of Martha Moxley===
In 2003, Kennedy published an article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, in which he insists that his cousin Michael Skakel&#x27;s indictment &quot;was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison&quot;. Kennedy argues that evidence suggests that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family&#x27;s live-in tutor, killed Moxley, and calls investigative journalist Dominick Dunne the &quot;driving force&quot; behind Skakel&#x27;s prosecution. In 2016, Kennedy released the book &quot;Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn&#x27;t Commit&quot;. In 2017, the rights to the book were optioned by FX Productions to develop a multi-part television series.

In 2018, Skakel&#x27;s conviction was vacated, and in 2020, prosecutors decided not to seek a new trial.

===Assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy===

On the evening of January 11, 2013, Charlie Rose interviewed Kennedy and his sister Rory at the Winspear Opera House in Dallas as a part of then Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings&#x27;s hand-chosen committee&#x27;s year-long program of celebrating John F. Kennedy&#x27;s life and presidency. Of JFK&#x27;s assassination, RFK Jr. said his father was &quot;fairly convinced&quot; Lee Harvey Oswald had not acted alone and believed the Warren Commission report was a &quot;shoddy piece of craftsmanship&quot;. RFK Jr. said, &quot;The evidence at this point I think is very, very convincing that it was not a lone gunman.&quot; He endorsed the 2013 edition of &quot;JFK and the Unspeakable&quot;, saying it had moved him to visit Dealey Plaza for the first time.

In November 2023, RFK Jr. launched a petition on his presidential campaign website for the Biden administration to release the estimated remaining 1% of documents related to the case. He said that finally releasing full and unredacted documents could help restore trust in the government.

In an interview on Lex Fridman&#x27;s podcast, Kennedy said that the evidence that the CIA was involved in the assassination was &quot;beyond any reasonable doubt&quot;.

Kennedy does not believe that Sirhan Sirhan fired the shot that killed his father, Robert F. Kennedy. Based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, especially Paul Schrade, who was standing next to Kennedy and was shot himself, as well as the autopsy, he believes there was a second gunman. In December 2017, he visited Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility near San Diego to meet Sirhan. After meeting Sirhan, he gave his support for a reinvestigation of the assassination.

=== Gender dysphoria ===

In a June 2023 podcast interview with Jordan Peterson, Kennedy posited that several issues in children, including gender dysphoria, might be linked to atrazine contamination in the water supply. He cited a 2010 study by Hayes that claims that acute atrazine exposure causes chemical castration and feminization in frogs, leading some to become hermaphrodites. Kennedy suggested that there was other evidence indicating potential effects on humans. YouTube removed the interview under its vaccine misinformation policy, a decision Peterson and Kennedy criticized as censorship. Various publications denounced the theory, such as &quot;Philadelphia Gay News&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, and &quot;Vice&quot;.

After media criticism, a spokesperson for Kennedy&#x27;s 2024 presidential campaign told &quot;CNN&quot; that he was being mischaracterized and that he was not claiming that endocrine disruptors were the sole cause of gender dysphoria, but rather proposing further research. Andrea Gore, a professor of neuroendocrinology at the University of Texas at Austin, said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think people should be making statements about the relationship between environmental chemicals and changes in sexuality when there&#x27;s zero evidence.&quot;

=== Conspiracy theory about contrails ===
In August 2024, after he endorsed Trump for president and started to work with Trump&#x27;s campaign, Kennedy posted, &quot;We are going to stop this crime&quot; of chemtrails. Belief in chemtrails involves a conspiracy theory that airplane water vapor trails (contrails) are purposely dumped chemicals designed to harm the population.

=== Raw milk ===
Kennedy says that he drinks only raw milk and believes that it has health benefits. In October 2024, he accused the FDA of &quot;aggressive suppression&quot; of raw milk.

Raw milk has not been pasteurized to kill harmful pathogens. Experts and the FDA say raw milk is not more nutritious than pasteurized milk and consuming raw milk has disease risks. Raw milk consumption has caused many U.S. disease outbreaks. The U.S. prohibits interstate commerce in raw milk and 20 states prohibit its sale.

==Personal life==

=== General interests ===
Kennedy is a licensed master falconer and has trained hawks since he was 11. He breeds hawks and falcons and is also licensed as a raptor propagator and a wildlife rehabilitator. He holds permits for Federal Game Keeper, Bird Bander, and Scientific Collector. He was president of the New York State Falconry Association from 1988 to 1991. In 1987, while on Governor Mario Cuomo&#x27;s New York State Falconry Advising Committee, Kennedy authored New York State&#x27;s examination to qualify apprentice falconers. Later that year, he wrote the &quot;New York State Apprentice Falconer&#x27;s Manual&quot;, which was published by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and remains in use.

Kennedy is also a whitewater kayaker. His father introduced him and his siblings to whitewater kayaking during trips down the Green and Yampa Rivers in Utah and Colorado, the Columbia River, the Middle Fork Salmon in Idaho, and the Upper Hudson Gorge. Between 1976 and 1981, Kennedy was a partner and guide at a whitewater company, Utopian, based in West Forks, Maine. He organized and led several &quot;first-descent&quot; whitewater expeditions to Latin America, including three hitherto unexplored rivers: the Apurimac, Peru, in 1975; the Atrato, Colombia, in 1979; and the Caroni, Venezuela, in 1982. In 1993, he made an early descent of the Great Whale River in northern Quebec, Canada.

In 2015, Kennedy took two of his sons to the Yukon to visit Mount Kennedy and run the Alsek River, a whitewater river fed by the Alsek Glacier. Mount Kennedy was Canada&#x27;s highest unclimbed peak when the Canadian government named it for John F. Kennedy in 1964. In 1965, Kennedy&#x27;s father became the first person to climb Mount Kennedy.

===Marriages and children===
On April 3, 1982, Kennedy married Emily Ruth Black, whom he met at the University of Virginia School of Law. Kennedy and Black separated in 1992 and divorced in 1994. On April 15, 1994, Kennedy married architect and designer Mary Kathleen Richardson, a close friend of his sister Kerry, aboard a research vessel on the Hudson River. Kennedy has six children, two with Black and four with Richardson.

During his marriage to Richardson, Kennedy was known among his friends for sending explicit nude photos of women that they presumed he had taken, according to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He reportedly engaged in multiple affairs during the marriage. His friends later called him a &quot;lifelong philanderer&quot;. On May 12, 2010, Kennedy filed for divorce from Richardson. On May 16, 2012, Richardson was found dead in a building on the grounds of her home in Bedford, New York. The Westchester County Medical Examiner ruled the death a suicide due to asphyxiation from hanging. Before her death, Richardson had discovered Kennedy&#x27;s personal journal from 2001, in which he recorded sexual encounters with 37 different women. According to Kennedy, Richardson passed the journal along &quot;to her sisters with instructions that, if anything happened to her, [it should be] published in the press&quot;. During their divorce, Richardson began exhibiting signs of drug and alcohol abuse and psychiatric distress. After her death, Kennedy won a court case against Richardson&#x27;s siblings to have her buried alongside fellow Kennedy family members in St. Francis Xavier Cemetery in Centerville, Massachusetts, instead of closer to her siblings in New York. Shortly after her burial, Kennedy had her body disinterred and moved to an unmarked grave in an empty area of the cemetery, to allow for more space for future burials closer to the Kennedy family plots. Kennedy&#x27;s niece Saoirse Kennedy Hill was buried next to Richardson after her death from a drug overdose at age 22.

In 2012, Kennedy began dating the actress Cheryl Hines. They married on August 2, 2014, at the Kennedy Compound. The couple were introduced by Larry David, Hines&#x27;s co-star on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. Kennedy and Hines reside in Los Angeles and Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

In September 2024, Olivia Nuzzi, a reporter for &quot;New York&quot; magazine who had been covering his presidential campaign, told her editors that she had been in a relationship with Kennedy, which she described as personal but not physical.

===Health===
During Kennedy&#x27;s college years, he started having heart problems, which he has said were caused by caffeine, stress, and sleep deprivation.

In his 40s, Kennedy developed adductor spasmodic dysphonia, an organic voice disorder that causes his voice to quaver and makes speech difficult. It is a form of involuntary movement affecting the larynx, related to dystonia. Kennedy said he traveled to Kyoto, Japan, for a procedure where a titanium bridge was inserted between his vocal cords to try to relieve the disorder.

Kennedy began experiencing severe short- and long-term memory loss and mental fog in 2010. In a 2012 divorce court deposition, he attributed neurological issues to &quot;a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died&quot;, in addition to mercury poisoning from eating large quantities of tuna. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Kennedy&#x27;s campaign &quot;has not released his medical records that could verify his account, and Kennedy has previously spread health misinformation, including about mercury in vaccines&quot;.

=== Religion ===
Kennedy is a Catholic. In 2005, journalist Michael Paulson called him &quot;a deeply devout Catholic who attends daily Mass&quot;. Kennedy considers Francis of Assisi his patron saint and a role model. In a 2005 interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, he said he was deeply inspired by Francis&#x27;s devotion to social justice, helping the poor, animal welfare, and environmentalism; Francis is a patron saint of ecology. In 2004, Kennedy published a biography, &quot;Saint Francis of Assisi: A Life of Joy&quot;. He also said Catholicism was a vehicle of his environmentalism, adding, &quot;environmental work is spiritual work&quot;. Despite identifying as pro-life, Kennedy also identifies with liberal Catholicism. He criticized the church&#x27;s argument that John Kerry should have been denied communion because of his support for abortion rights. In a 2018 interview with &quot;Vatican News&quot;, Kennedy expressed his admiration for Pope John XXIII, who is best known for his modernization of the church in the 1960s. Kennedy said, &quot;the Church should be an instrument of justice and kindness around the world.&quot;

=== Sexual assault allegations ===
In July 2024, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; reported that in the late 1990s, when he was in his 40s, Kennedy engaged in sexual misconduct with Eliza Cooney, a 23-year-old part-time babysitter for his children. Cooney alleges that Kennedy groped her and touched her inappropriately on multiple occasions and asked her to rub lotion on his back when the two were alone in a bedroom. Kennedy called this &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; piece a &quot;lot of garbage&quot;. When asked specifically about Cooney&#x27;s allegation, he responded, &quot;I am not a church boy. I had a very, very rambunctious youth. I said in my announcement speech that I have so many skeletons in my closet that if they could all vote, I could run for king of the world.&quot; When pressed further, he said he had no comment. After the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; piece was published, Cooney said that Kennedy texted her: &quot;I have no memory of this incident, but I apologize sincerely for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable or anything I did or said that offended you or hurt your feelings. I never intended you any harm. If I hurt you, it was inadvertent. I feel badly for doing so.&quot; Cooney said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s an apology if you say &#x27;I don&#x27;t remember&#x27;...In the context of all his public appearances, it seemed a little bit—it didn&#x27;t match. It was like a throwaway.&quot;

=== Treatment of dead animals ===
In July 2024, an image of Kennedy holding a charred animal carcass captured in 2010 surfaced in a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; story, which alleged that the carcass belonged to a dog and that Kennedy ate it. Kennedy denied that he ate dog meat, and said the animal carcass in the picture was a goat. According to Snopes, the carcass in the photo is lamb. Kennedy had eaten dog, horse, and guinea pig meat before 2001, however.

In August 2024, Kennedy released a video on Twitter, acknowledging that in October 2014 he placed a dead six-month-old bear in Central Park after initially planning to skin it for meat. Kennedy claimed that the bear had been hit by a car in front of him and that he ultimately abandoned the carcass for fear that it would spoil before he could preserve it, deliberately positioning the body to give the impression that it had been struck by a cyclist in Central Park. He released the video in advance of a story in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that detailed the incident. At the time of the incident, the spectacle of a dead bear in a New York City park made the local news. A resulting necropsy by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation found that the death was caused by &quot;blunt force injuries consistent with a motor vehicle collision&quot;.

In a 2012 &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; magazine profile of Kennedy&#x27;s daughter Kathleen (&quot;Kick&quot;), she recounted a story about how her father—who, she said, liked to study animal skulls and skeletons—used a chainsaw to sever the head of a dead beached whale in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, then strapped the whale&#x27;s head to the top of their minivan with bungee cords for the five-hour drive home, saying, &quot;every time we accelerated on the highway, whale juice would pour into the windows of the car&quot; and they &quot;had plastic bags over our heads with mouth holes cut out, and people on the highway were giving us the finger, but that was just normal day-to-day stuff for us&quot;. In September 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement announced that it was investigating the incident.

<doc id="522304" wikidata="Q5225745" url="?curid=522304" title="Darton State College">
<text>Darton State College was a public college in Albany, Georgia. It was part of the University System of Georgia and had its highest enrollment, 6,097 students, in 2011. Prior to its merger with Albany State University in 2016, the college offered 84 two-year transfer and career associate degrees, 4 four-year baccalaureate degrees, and 49 certificate programs.

== History ==

The institution was founded as Albany Junior College in 1963 and offered its first classes in 1966.

In 1987, a committee of faculty, staff, students and community members chose the name Darton College as part of its reclassification as a state college. &quot;Darton&quot; is an Old English word probably meaning &quot;town by the (River) Dearne,&quot; as evidenced in the British village of that name; it refers to Albany&#x27;s location on the Flint River.

In November 2015, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia announced the consolidation of Albany State University and Darton State College, appointing Dr. Arthur Dunning as President of the university. The new combined institutions assumed the name and branding of Albany State University. The Darton campus became Albany State University West Campus and the location of the university&#x27;s Darton College of Health Professions.

The merger of the two institutions greatly decreased the combined enrollment. Fall 2013 enrollments were 6,195 for Darton State College and 4,260 for Albany State University, while Fall 2017 enrollments for the new combined Albany State University were 6,615. This represents a 27% decrease over that period.

== Campus ==
The 186 acre campus on Albany&#x27;s western edge included a 470-seat theater, library, fitness center, computer labs, and sports facilities such as tennis and racquetball courts, indoor swimming pool, indoor bowling alley and climbing wall, with surrounding nature trails, soccer fields, ball fields, and pecan trees.

== Student population ==
At one time, Darton College enrolled more than half of the area&#x27;s high school graduates and approximately 45% of the students were from Dougherty County. (The population of the MSA was 162,800 in 2004.) Approximately 1% of students were from out-of-state and about 100 were from other countries.

About 57% of Darton&#x27;s students were under age 24. Approximately 45% were non-Hispanic black, and 50% were non-Hispanic white — no other group constituted more than 3% (self-reported).

Full-time enrollment was approximately 47%.

In August, 2013, President Sireno stated that &quot;Darton State College has seen a 90.5 percent enrollment increase over the past decade.&quot;

== Academics ==

Darton State College provided educational opportunities and services to Southwest Georgia with a variety of programs, including three bachelors of science and one bachelor of arts degree, four associate degrees, 10 career associate degrees and 15 certificates. Darton prepared students to enter the workforce or continue their education at another four-year institution. Darton State College was a public institution as part of the University System of Georgia and was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

=== Distance learning ===
To increase access to a college education, grants enabled Darton to offer 39 fully online degrees, 10 partially online degrees, 13 fully online certificate programs, and over 96 individual distance learning courses over the Internet, through local Channel 19 telecasts, GVNS video-conferencing, and at sites off the main campus: Cordele, Thomasville, Colquitt, Rome, Barnesville, Columbus, Valdosta, Waycross, Sandersville, Swainsboro, and Atlanta, Georgia. Darton College had a strong presence in state distance learning initiatives, with its core curriculum courses in many programs available online.

=== Nursing Division ===
Darton&#x27;s Nursing Division provided education for many of Southwest Georgia&#x27;s nurses — including 70% of all Registered Nurses (RNs) in Albany hospitals and 30% of all RNs in 38 southwest Georgia counties. As of spring 2005, the college had awarded 2,259 nursing degrees. In 2009, there were 177 graduates from the nursing program and 25 faculty members.

The division had satellite programs in Cordele, Sandersville, Swainsboro and Thomasville. Darton College received a $2.48 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor in 2005 to develop an online nursing program. In 2010, a new 25,800 square foot Nursing Building opened on the main campus in Albany.

The five-semester nursing program led to an Associate of Science in Nursing degree and eligibility to take registered nurse licensure exams. In May 2011, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia approved Darton&#x27;s change to State College status so that a four-year program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Nursing could be developed. The program was intended for RNs with an associate degree in Nursing. Darton offered the program beginning in fall 2013.

The nursing program was accredited by the NLNAC.

==Instructional technology==

Darton was a leader in educational technology use. It was named a “Most-Wired Campus” by Yahoo and a “Leader in Digital Technology” by the American Association of Community Colleges. In addition to its huge variety of online course offerings, Darton used technologies such as Wimba Classroom, streaming media, and motion capture technology.

== Extracurricular activities ==

Extracurricular activities included groups such as the Cultural Exchange Club, Book Talk and the Darton Association of Nursing Students, as well as intramural athletics, pecan picking, league tournament athletics, community service associations and honor societies.

== Sports ==
Students were able to participate in an array of Georgia Junior College Athletic Association/National Junior College Athletic Association intercollegiate athletics, including women&#x27;s soccer, golf, women&#x27;s softball and basketball, and men&#x27;s baseball.

Darton received the 2005–06 Trophy Cup from the GJCAA for having the top two-year athletic program in the state. Four of the college&#x27;s teams went to nationals in 2006. The Men&#x27;s Golf Team won the NJCAA National Championship for the second year in a row in 2006. Darton College men&#x27;s golf team won the national title in 2005, 2006, 2007 and came runners up in 2008. The women&#x27;s soccer team were national runners-up in 2005 and were later ranked highly in the NJCAA.

Darton&#x27;s men and women swimming programs placed third overall at the 2007 NJCAA National Championships with virtually every member on the competing roster securing All-American Honors. In addition, two of the swimmers won their events, making them national champions.

Darton College women&#x27;s soccer team went all the way to the NJCAA National Championship game again in 2008 but lost 3–2. They finished ranked second in the nation with a 23-1-1 record.

Darton College Men&#x27;s XC team final time winning the GCAA Cross Country Championship back on October 25, 2014, was a year to remember. Not only did the Men&#x27;s XC team win the Championship but David Thornton won the (Eight Kilometer) meet and also broke the school record with a winning time of 25 minutes and 38 seconds. The previous record was 26:04.(2012)

<doc id="522305" wikidata="Q1349841" url="?curid=522305" title="Ford RS200">
<text>The Ford RS200 is a mid-engined, all-wheel-drive sports car that was produced by Ford Motorsport in Boreham, UK, from 1984 to 1986. The road-going RS200 was the basis for Ford&#x27;s Group B rally car and was designed to comply with FIA homologation regulations, which required 200 parts kits to be produced and at least one road-legal car to be assembled. It was first displayed to the public at the Belfast Motor Show.

== History ==
Following the introduction of the Mk3 Escort in 1980, Ford Motorsport set about developing a rear-wheel-drive, turbocharged variant of the vehicle that could be entered into competition in Group B rally racing - in which Ford had dominated in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s with the Mk1 and Mk2 Escorts. It dubbed the new vehicle the Escort RS 1700T. A problem-filled development, plus internal apathy against the car (which had little in common with the production version of the Mk3 Escort) led Ford to abandon the project in frustration in 1983, leaving them without a new vehicle to enter into Group B. Not wanting to abandon Group B or simply &quot;write off&quot; the cost of developing the failed 1700T, executives decided to make use of the lessons learned developing that vehicle in preparing a new, purpose-built rally car. In addition, Ford executives became adamant that the new vehicle would feature all-wheel-drive, an addition they felt would be necessary to allow it to compete properly with all-wheel-drive models from Peugeot and Audi.
The new vehicle was a unique design, featuring a plastic-fiberglass composite body designed by Ghia, a mid-mounted engine and four-wheel drive. The cars were built on behalf of Ford by another company well known for its expertise in producing fibreglass bodies - Reliant. To aid weight distribution, designers mounted the transmission at the front of the car, which required that power from the mid-mounted engine go first up to the front wheels and then be run back again to the rear, creating a complex drive train setup. The chassis was designed by former Formula One designer Tony Southgate, and Ford&#x27;s John Wheeler, a former F1 engineer, aided in early development. A double wishbone suspension setup with twin dampers on all four wheels aided handling and helped give the car what was often regarded as being the best balanced platform of any of the RS200&#x27;s contemporary competitors. The Ford parts-bin was raided to help give the RS200 a Ford corporate look; for example, the front windscreen and rear lights were identical to those of the early Sierra and the doors were cut-down Sierra items. Small parts-bin items like switchgear were also used to save development time and expenses.
Power came from a , single turbocharged Ford-Cosworth &quot;BDT&quot; engine producing in road-going trim, and between in racing trim; upgrade kits were available for road-going versions to boost power output to over . Although the RS had the balance and poise necessary to be competitive, its power-to-weight ratio was poor by comparison, and its engine produced notorious low-RPM lag, making it difficult to drive and ultimately less competitive. Factory driver Kalle Grundel&#x27;s third-place finish at the 1986 WRC Rally of Sweden represented the vehicle&#x27;s best-ever finish in Group B rallying competition, although the model did see limited success outside of the ultra-competitive Group B class. However, only one event later, at the Rally de Portugal, a Ford RS200 was involved in one of the most dramatic accidents in WRC history, claiming the lives of three spectators and injuring many others. Another Ford RS200 was crashed by Swiss Formula One driver Marc Surer against a tree during the 1986 Hessen-Rallye in Germany, killing his co-driver and friend Michel Wyder instantly.

The accident at Rally Portugal set off a chain reaction and the RS200 became obsolete after only one full year of competition as the FIA, the governing board, which at the time controlled WRC rally racing, abolished Group B after the 1986 season. For 1987, Ford had planned to introduce an &quot;Evolution&quot; variant of the RS200, featuring a development of the BDT engine, called later as BDT-E, displacing , developed by Briton Brian Hart. Power figures for the engine vary quite a bit from source to source, depending on the mechanical setup e.g. boost levels, power output ranges from to ; although most typical output was at 8,000 rpm and at 5,500 rpm of torque. The ban on Group B racing effectively forced the E2 model into retirement; however, more than a dozen of them were successfully run from August 1986 until October 1992 in the FIA European Championships for Rallycross Drivers events all over Europe, and Norwegian Martin Schanche claimed the 1991 European rallycross title with a Ford RS200 E2 that produced over .

One RS200, which found its way into circuit racing, originated as a road car; it was converted to IMSA GTO specification powered by an over-750 BHP 2.0 litre turbo BDTE Cosworth Evolution engine. Competing against the numerous factory-backed teams such as Mazda, Mercury and Nissan, with their newly built spaceframe specials, despite being a privateer, the car never achieved any real success to be a serious contender and was kept by the original owner. A parts car was built in England and later used to compete in the unlimited category at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, where it was driven by Swede Stig Blomqvist in 2001, 2002 and 2004 and in 2009 by former British Rallycross champion Mark Rennison.

In June 2024, Ford &amp; Boreham Motorworks teased a &quot;Remaster&quot; of the RS200, alongside the Ford Escort MK1 continuation.

==Production==

FIA homologation rules for Group B required the construction of at least 200 road-legal vehicles, and Ford contracted Reliant Motors PLC to construct these 200 units at their Shenstone facility, with spare parts for another 20+ units put aside for the racing teams. Those chassis and spare parts were later also used to build a couple of non-genuine, so-called &quot;bitsa&quot; cars. The Ford RS200 originally cost £49,995 in 1985. However, due to its cult status and Group B legacy, the car&#x27;s value has increased to over six figures, with the highly sought-after Evolution (EVO) models selling for significantly more. For example, in 2017, a Ford RS200 Evolution sold for $550,000 at a Bonhams auction in the US, which is the record auction price for the car. In November 2023, another Ford RS200 Evolution sold for £486,000 at Iconic Auctioneers. 

=== Evolution (E/E2) ===
Group B required any modifications and upgrades had to be homologated by building a further batch of 20 road models to certify the revised specification. Even though Group B had been banned by the time the evolution model was ready, Ford produced the road cars regardless.

A total of 24 of the 200 original cars were reportedly later converted to the so-called &quot;Evolution&quot; models, mostly marked by their owners as &quot;E&quot; or &quot;E2&quot; types. Ford&#x27;s first intention was to mark the FIA-required 20 &quot;Evo&quot; cars as series numbers 201 to 220 but as this was actually not necessary according to the FIA rules they later kept their original series numbers (e.g. 201 = 012, 202 = 146, 203 = 174 et cetera). Changes were mostly mechanical, with the engine being designated BDT-E. Additional cool ducts were fitted above the roof, on either side of the main engine intake.

=== &#x27;S&#x27; Version ===
During the sales programme a Canadian entrepreneur, Murray H. de Weerdt, approached Ford with a proposal to purchase 20 cars and to commission them to have a better level of equipment in an attempt to produce a more marketable &quot;ultimate RS200&quot;. He coined the term &quot;The &#x27;S&#x27; Version&quot; although permission was never formerly granted by Ford to use this designation however he went on to produce sale literature. Changes included wider seats, Air Conditioning, improved cooling and increased power. A total of 20 were produced, 16 standard cars and 4 evolution spec, including 4 in red. The deal ultimately never came to fruition although Mr de Weerdt went on to own one of the cars himself, chassis number 110. The remaining 19 were sold by Ford to private buyers. The full chassis number list is still available where the &quot;S&quot; designation can be seen.

<doc id="522306" wikidata="Q674380" url="?curid=522306" title="Michael J. Nelson">
<text>Michael John Nelson (born October 11, 1964) is an American comedian and writer, most known for his work on the television series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;). Nelson was the head writer of the series for most of the show&#x27;s original eleven-year run, and spent half of that time as the on-air host, also named Mike Nelson. In addition to writing books, Nelson is currently part of the online movie riffing site RiffTrax, and was previously part of the straight-to-DVD &quot;Film Crew&quot; with fellow &quot;MST3K&quot; alumni, Bill Corbett and Kevin Murphy.

==Early life==
Michael John Nelson was born in the Chicago suburb of St. Charles, Illinois. His ancestry is Danish, German, and Irish. He lived in Geneva, Illinois, until the age of twelve, when his family moved to north-western Wisconsin. He studied theatre and music at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls, but he left before graduating and moved to the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area.

==Career==

===&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;===
Nelson was working as a waiter at T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s and doing occasional stand-up comedy when he was offered a job on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, typing the suggestions in the writing room. The writers told him to feel free to make some comments on the movies they were watching, and Nelson impressed them so much with his wit and comedic timing that they made him a staff writer, and, later, head writer. Nelson also appeared frequently in the show&#x27;s host segments, often playing characters from the movies being mocked such as Torgo from the infamous &quot;&quot;.

When series creator and host Joel Hodgson decided to leave halfway through the fifth season, he chose Nelson as his replacement, reportedly because he thought Nelson was a natural leader, a gifted comedian, and a gifted muse, and also because Nelson simply looked good standing next to the puppets. Nelson remained as host for another five and a half seasons (surviving the show&#x27;s switching networks from Comedy Central to the Sci-Fi Channel) until the original run ended in 1999.

===Post-&quot;MST3K&quot;===
Writing

Since the series ended, Nelson has worked steadily as a writer, publishing several books (as of March 2006): &quot;Mike Nelson&#x27;s Movie Megacheese&quot;, &quot;Mike Nelson&#x27;s Mind Over Matters&quot; and &quot;Mike Nelson&#x27;s Death Rat!&quot;, the last being his first novel. His other works include a series of pop-culture humor books, &quot;Happy Kitty Bunny Pony&quot;, &quot;Goth-Icky&quot;, and &quot;Love Sick&quot;, as well as a monthly column for &quot;Home Theater Magazine&quot;. He also wrote for the short-lived game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Bowl&quot;. He has commentary tracks for DVD releases of several films, including &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;, &quot;The Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, &quot;Plan 9 from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, and &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. With his &quot;MST3K&quot; co-stars Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, he was part of a comedy team called &quot;The Film Crew&quot;, which has created comedy segments for National Public Radio. The first Film Crew DVD, &quot;Hollywood After Dark&quot;, was released July 10, 2007, and three more followed in the months after. 
Legend Films | RiffTrax

In 2006, Nelson was appointed Chief Content Producer for Legend Films. He is responsible for building and leading the company&#x27;s creative content, providing continuous commentaries, and developing other premium web-based programming. &quot;I&#x27;m very excited. Legend Films is such a great fit for me—talented people who consistently put out a great product. Plus, there are Flaming Hot Cheetos in the lunch room vending machine. That made it an easy choice to join the team,&quot; enthused Nelson.

One of the projects put together by Nelson and Legend Films was RiffTrax, a website offering the purchase of downloadable audio commentaries once again costarring two former &quot;MST3K&quot; cast members Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. The first commentary made available through the service was for &quot;Road House&quot;. In a September 2006 interview, Nelson said he felt that Rifftrax may be the closest thing to a reunion of the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; team. In 2016, additional MST3K alumni, Joel Hodgson, Trace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl, and Bridget Jones Nelson all appeared for a live reunion at the State Theatre in Minneapolis with Nelson, Murphy and Corbett. They were also joined by the newest host, Jonah Ray.

Voice work

In 2013, Nelson agreed to do voiceover work for &quot;Armikrog&quot;. Nelson voices the lead character, Tommynaut.

Podcasts

In 2016, Nelson and David Berge started the podcast &quot;Like Trees Walking&quot;. They look at life and faith from a Christian perspective, with a lightly humorous, offbeat approach.

Since 2017, he has created, with Conor Lastowka, the podcast &quot;372 Pages We&#x27;ll Never Get Back&quot;, which analyses books of contested quality.

==Personal life==
Nelson has described the role of Christianity in his family as &quot;the very centerpiece of our lives. We&#x27;re heavily involved in our church, my wife works with youth groups and churches as her profession, and almost every career and life decision I make depends upon it.&quot; He studies Christian apologetics and cites William Lane Craig and C.S. Lewis as influences.

Nelson has suffered from chronic debilitating headaches for most of his adult life; he wrote a short piece about his experience for the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="522313" wikidata="Q1503735" url="?curid=522313" title="Posterior pituitary">
<text>The posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) is the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland which is part of the endocrine system. The posterior pituitary is not glandular as is the anterior pituitary. Instead, it is largely a collection of axonal projections from the hypothalamus that terminate behind the anterior pituitary, and serve as a site for the secretion of neurohypophysial hormones (oxytocin and vasopressin) directly into the blood. The hypothalamic–neurohypophyseal system is composed of the hypothalamus (the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus), posterior pituitary, and these axonal projections.

==Structure==
The posterior pituitary consists mainly of neuronal projections (axons) of magnocellular neurosecretory cells extending from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. These axons store and release neurohypophysial hormones oxytocin and vasopressin into the neurohypophyseal capillaries, from there they get into the systemic circulation (and partly back into the hypophyseal portal system). In addition to axons, the posterior pituitary also contains pituicytes, specialized glial cells resembling astrocytes assisting in the storage and release of the hormones.

Classification of the posterior pituitary varies, but most sources include the two regions below:
===Pars nervosa===
Also called the neural lobe or posterior lobe, this region constitutes the majority of the posterior pituitary and is the storage site of oxytocin and vasopressin. Sometimes (incorrectly) considered synonymous with the posterior pituitary, the pars nervosa includes Herring bodies and pituicytes.
===Infundibular stalk===

Also known as the infundibulum or pituitary stalk, the infundibular stalk bridges the hypothalamic and hypophyseal systems.

The median eminence is only occasionally included as part of the posterior pituitary. Other sources specifically exclude it from the pituitary.

A few sources include the pars intermedia as part of the posterior lobe, but this is a minority view. It is based upon the gross anatomical separation of the posterior and anterior pituitary along the cystic remnants of Rathke&#x27;s pouch, causing the pars intermedia to remain attached to the neurohypophysis.

==Function==

===Hormone secretion===
Two hormones are classically considered as being related to the posterior pituitary: oxytocin and vasopressin. These hormones are created in the hypothalamus and released in the posterior pituitary. After creation, they are stored in neurosecretory vesicles regrouped into Herring bodies before being secreted in the posterior pituitary via the bloodstream.

==Clinical significance==
Insufficient secretion of vasopressin underlies diabetes insipidus, a condition in which the body loses the capacity to concentrate urine. Affected individuals excrete as much as 20 liters of dilute urine per day. Oversecretion of vasopressin causes the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

<text>The Wind River Range (or &quot;Winds&quot; for short) is a mountain range of the Rocky Mountains in western Wyoming in the United States. The range runs roughly NW–SE for approximately . The Continental Divide follows the crest of the range and includes Gannett Peak, which at , is the highest peak in Wyoming; and also Fremont Peak at , the third highest peak in Wyoming. There are more than 40 other named peaks in excess of . With the exception of the Grand Teton in the Teton Range, the next 19 highest peaks in Wyoming after Gannett are also in the Winds.

Two large national forests including three wilderness areas encompass most of the mountain range. Shoshone National Forest is on the eastern side of the continental divide while Bridger-Teton National Forest is on the west. Both national forests and the entire mountain range are an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Portions of the east side of the range are inside the Wind River Indian Reservation.

==History==
Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin, such as the Shoshones and Absarokas (Crow) Native Americans, lived in the range beginning 7000 and 9000 years ago. Villages as high as in elevation, dating from 700 to 2000 BC, have recently been studied by archaeologists. These villages were established by the Sheepeater band of Shoshone during pine nut harvesting season. One, dubbed &quot;High Rise&quot;, has 60 lodges over a space of 26 acres and was recently added to the National Register of Historic Places.

One of the men from the Lewis and Clark expedition, John Colter, is thought to be the first European American person to view the range when he visited the area around 1807, though little is known about his travels through the area. In 1812, a party led by Wilson Price Hunt were the first to cross South Pass, at the southern end of the range, the pass which marked the continental divide and crest of the Rocky Mountains and became an important portion of the Oregon Trail.

Climbing was pursued in the mid to late 1800s by men such as John C. Fremont, typically for the purpose of surveying the region. Early climbers to come purely for recreation began arriving in the 1920s. Gannett Peak, the range and Wyoming&#x27;s tallest, was first climbed by Arthur Tate and Floyd Stahlnaker in 1922. Most of the early climbing in the region focused around the Titcomb Basin, slowly radiating outwards. Today, the Titcomb Basin remains one of the area&#x27;s busiest recreation attractions along with the Cirque of the Towers to the south.

Much of the Wind River Range received federal protection as National Forest primitive areas during 1931–32. The Wind River Range is now largely protected by three federal wilderness areas. These include the Bridger Wilderness on the western slope, designated in 1964, and the Fitzpatrick Wilderness and Popo Agie Wilderness on the eastern slope, designated in 1976 and 1984 respectively. Together these wilderness areas protect , making the Wind River Range one of the largest road-free areas in the continental United States. Part of the eastern slope of the Wind River Range is also under the protection of the Wind River Indian Reservation.

==Geology==
The Winds are composed primarily of a granitic batholith which is granite rock formed deep under the surface of the Earth, over one billion years ago. Over hundreds of millions of years, rocks that were once covering this batholith eroded away. As the land continued to rise during the Laramide orogeny, further erosion occurred until all that remained were the granitic rocks. The ice ages beginning 500,000 years ago began carving the rocks into their present shapes. Within the Winds, numerous lakes were formed by the glaciers and numerous cirques, or circular valleys, were carved out of the rocks, the most well known being the Cirque of the Towers, in the southern section of the range. Shoshone National Forest claims that there are 16 named and 140 unnamed glaciers just on the east side of the range for a total of 156, with another 27 reported by Bridger-Teton National Forest for the western slopes of the range. Several of these are the largest glaciers in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. Gannett Glacier which flows down the north slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the Rocky Mountains of the U.S., and is located in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness in Shoshone National Forest.

==Hydrology==
Several major rivers have headwaters on either side of the range. The Green and Big Sandy rivers drain southward from the west side of the range, while the Wind River drains eastward through the Shoshone Basin. The Green is the largest fork of the Colorado River while the Wind River, after changing its name to the Bighorn River, is the largest fork of the Yellowstone River. The range includes several canyons on either side, including Silas Canyon and Sinks Canyon both on the eastern side. The canyons are carved by rivers such as the Middle Fork of the Popo Agie which feeds the Wind River.

The Bridger Wilderness contains over 1,300 lakes. These lakes range in size from less than to over , with an average size of about . Historically, the lakes and streams of the Bridger Wilderness were devoid of fish, as were most alpine lakes throughout the Rocky Mountains. The first known transplant of fish into the area took place in 1907 when Colorado River cutthroat trout were introduced into North Fork Lake. Considerable fish stocking by individuals, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Department, occurred between 1924 and 1935.

==Ecology==

The Winds are known to have a small grizzly bear population, primarily in the northernmost areas. Other mammals include the black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, mountain lion and wolverine. Bald eagles, falcons and hawks are just a few of the 300 species of birds known to inhabit the region. The streams and lakes are home to Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brook, brown, lake, and golden trout—about 2.5 million of which were stocked by a local explorer named Finis Mitchell and his wife during the Great Depression. The forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce.

The range sits alongside many of the animal migration routes in the United States and contains several important passes, notably South Pass, , at the south end of the range, which was one of the more important passes on the Oregon Trail as it passed through the Rockies. Aside from South Pass, which is at the southernmost tip of the range, no roads cross the mountains until Union Pass, at the northern terminus of the range. There are many passes between tall peaks across the continental divide, which runs through the entire range.

==Recreation==
The Winds are a popular recreation destination and the vast wilderness areas attract hikers, climbers and skiers. The Winds have many back country areas that see heavy use despite the relative remoteness of many of the trail-heads and the long approaches from those trail-heads to reach routes. Two of the more popular backpacking destinations are the Titcomb Basin (commonly accessed via the Elkhart Park Trailhead) and the Cirque of the Towers (commonly accessed via the Big Sandy Trailhead). The exposed granite in the higher elevations of the range is particularly attractive to climbers and areas such as Cirque of the Towers in the southern portion of the range are facing overuse issues as a result. According to the White Pine Ski Resort website, the Winds are home to one ski area, White Pine, the only lift-accessible skiing and snowboarding in the range. Located near Pinedale, it is the oldest ski area in Wyoming.

==Trails==
The Wind River Range has a number of trailheads for backpackers to explore, including: 

* Big Sandy (elevation )
* Boulder Lake (elevation )
* Burnt Lake (elevation )
* Elkhart Park (elevation )
* Green River Lake (elevation )
* Half Moon Lake (elevation )
* Meadow Lake (elevation )
* New Fork (elevation )
* Scab Creek (elevation )
* Spring Creek Park (elevation )

A longtime popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts, the Wind River Range has also played host to a number of wilderness and outdoor education programs. The number of trailheads and terrain variety have made it an ideal stage for learning and exploration.

==Hazards==

Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures.

Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue. The U.S. Forest Service does not offer updated aggregated records on the official number of fatalities in the Wind River Range.

<text>Robert Preston Meservey (June 8, 1918 – March 21, 1987) was an American stage and screen actor, best-known for his role as Professor Harold Hill in the 1957 musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; for which he received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. He reprised the role in the 1962 film adaptation, for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination.

Preston made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Male Animal&quot; in 1952. He won two Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical for &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1957) and &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; (1967) and was Tony-nominated for &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; (1975). He co-starred alongside Steve McQueen as in the Sam Peckinpah film &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; (1972). Preston collaborated twice with director Blake Edwards, first in &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981) and again in &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (1982), the latter earning him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

==Early life==
Preston was born Robert Preston Meservey in Newton, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth L. (née Rea) and Frank Wesley Meservey, a garment worker and a billing clerk for American Express.

==Career==
=== 1938–1942: Career beginnings ===

Preston appeared in a stock company production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and a Pasadena Playhouse production of &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight.&quot; A Paramount Pictures attorney liked his work and recruited him to the studio. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Preston&#x27;s mother was employed by Decca Records, Bing Crosby&#x27;s label and was acquainted with Crosby&#x27;s brother Everett, a talent agent; she convinced him to watch one of Preston&#x27;s performances at the Pasadena Playhouse. The result was a contract with the Crosby agency and a movie deal with Paramount Pictures, Crosby&#x27;s studio. Preston made his screen debut in 1938, in the crime dramas &quot;King of Alcatraz&quot; (1938) and &quot;Illegal Traffic&quot;.

The studio ordered Preston to stop using his family name of Meservey. As Robert Preston, the name by which he was known for his entire professional career, he appeared in many Hollywood films, predominantly but not exclusively Westerns. He was Digby Geste in the sound remake of &quot;Beau Geste&quot; (1939) with Gary Cooper and Ray Milland, and Dick Allen in the Cecil B DeMille epic &quot;Union Pacific&quot;. Although not awarded until 2002 due to World War II, the film was the first winner of the Palme d&#x27;Or for 1939. He featured in &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940), also with Cooper. He played a Los Angeles police detective in the noir &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot; (1942).

=== 1942–1945: Military service ===
World War II interrupted Preston&#x27;s Paramount assignments. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he joined the United States Army Air Forces and served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. 9th Air Force with the 386th Bombardment Group (Medium). At the end of the war in Europe, the 386th and Captain Robert Meservey, an S-2 Officer (intelligence), were stationed in Sint-Truiden, Belgium. Meservey&#x27;s job had been receiving intelligence reports from 9th Air Force headquarters and briefing the bomber crews on what to expect in accomplishing their missions.

=== 1947–1956: Return to acting ===
When Preston resumed his movie career in 1947, it was as a freelance character actor, accepting roles for Paramount, RKO, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and various independent producers. Although Preston appeared in many films during this period, he never achieved major stardom. In an interview from 1984, he recalled, &quot;I played the lead in all the &#x27;B&#x27; pictures and the villain in all the epics. After a while, it was clear to me I had sort of reached what I was going to be in movies.&quot; During the 1950s, Preston found additional roles in television.

===1957–1979: &quot;The Music Man&quot; and acclaim ===

Preston is probably best known for his performance as Professor Harold Hill in Meredith Willson&#x27;s musical &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1957). &quot;They&#x27;d run through all the musical comedy people before they cast me&quot;, Preston remembered years later. He won a Tony Award for his performance. Preston appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on July 21, 1958. He continued in the role until January 1959, when he was replaced by Eddie Albert for 18 months. In June 1960, Preston returned to the role for two weeks, until his successor, Bert Parks, became available. Parks finished the Broadway run while Preston went to Hollywood to star in the film version of the show for Warner Bros. 

In 1961, Preston was asked to make a recording as part of a program by the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness to encourage schoolchildren to do more daily exercise. The song, &quot;Chicken Fat&quot;, composed by Meredith Willson and performed by Preston with full orchestral accompaniment, was recorded during sessions for &quot;The Music Man&quot; soundtrack. The recording was distributed by Capitol Records to elementary schools across the nation and played for students as they performed calisthenics. The song later became a surprise novelty hit and part of many baby-boomers&#x27; childhood memories. Preston played an important supporting role, as wagonmaster Roger Morgan, in the MGM epic, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962).
In 1965, Preston was the male half of the duo-lead musical, &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; with Mary Martin, for which he won his second Tony Award. He starred in the title role in the musical &quot;Ben Franklin in Paris&quot;, and he originated the role of Henry II in the stage production of &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, whom Peter O&#x27;Toole portrayed in the film version, receiving an Academy Award nomination. In 1974, he starred alongside Bernadette Peters in Jerry Herman&#x27;s Broadway musical &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; as Mack Sennett, the famous silent film director. That same year, the film version of &quot;Mame,&quot; another Jerry Herman musical, was released with Preston starring, alongside Lucille Ball, in the role of Beauregard Burnside. In the film, which was not a box-office success, Preston sang &quot;Loving You&quot;, which Herman wrote especially for Preston&#x27;s film portrayal. 

In 1978, Preston starred in another musical that did not make it to Broadway, &quot;The Prince of Grand Street,&quot; in which he played a matinee idol of New York&#x27;s Yiddish theater who refused to renounce the roles he had played in his youth, despite having aged out of them. With a libretto and songs by Bob Merrill and direction by Gene Saks, the show folded during its Boston tryout. In 1979, Preston portrayed a snake-handling family patriarch Hadley Chisholm in a CBS Western miniseries, &quot;The Chisholms&quot;, with Rosemary Harris as his wife, Minerva. The story chronicled the Chisholm family losing their land in Virginia and migrating to the west to begin a new life. When CBS continued the saga as a weekly series the following year, Preston reprised his role, but his character died in the fifth episode. The series, which also featured co-stars Ben Murphy, Brett Cullen, and James Van Patten, lasted only four more episodes after Preston&#x27;s departure.

===Later career===
Preston&#x27;s other film roles during the 1970s included Ace Bonner in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Junior Bonner&quot; (1972), Joseph Dobbs in the mystery &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, directed by Sidney Lumet, and &quot;Big Ed&quot; Bookman in &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977). He appeared in Blake Edwards&#x27; Hollywood satire, &quot;S.O.B.&quot; (1981) and Edwards&#x27; &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; (1982) , for which he was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actor. His last role in a theatrical film was in &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (1984) as an interstellar military recruiter called &quot;Centauri&quot;. Preston said that he based his approach to the character of Centauri on that which he had taken to Professor Harold Hill. Indeed, the role of Centauri was written for him with his performance as Harold Hill in mind. On television, Preston starred in the well-received CBS whodunit &quot;Rehearsal for Murder&quot; (1982), as a playwright attempting to solve the murder of his fiancée. He portrayed an aging gunfighter in &quot;September Gun&quot; (1983), a CBS TV Western film opposite Patty Duke and Christopher Lloyd. In 1985, he starred in another well-received TV movie &quot;Finnegan, Begin Again&quot; with Mary Tyler Moore, for HBO. Preston&#x27;s final role was in the CBS TV film &quot;Outrage!&quot; (1986); he appeared as a grief-stricken father who seeks justice for the brutal rape and murder of his daughter.

==Personal life and death ==
Preston married actress Catherine Craig in 1940.

On March 21, 1987, at age 68, Preston died of lung cancer.

He is the subject of a 2022 biography, &quot;Robert Preston: Forever the Music Man&quot;, written by Debra Warren.

<text>Henri Alexandre Deslandres (; 24 July 1853 – 15 January 1948) was a French astronomer, director of the Meudon and Paris Observatories, who carried out intensive studies on the behaviour of the atmosphere of the Sun.

==Biography==
Deslandres&#x27; undergraduate years at the École Polytechnique were played out against the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War and the chaos of the Paris Commune so, on graduation in 1874, he responded to the continuing military tension with the emerging Germany by embarking on a military career. Rising to the rank of captain in the engineers, he became increasingly interested in physics and, in 1881, resigned his commission to join Alfred Cornu&#x27;s laboratory at the École Polytechnique, working on spectroscopy. He continued his spectroscopic work at the Sorbonne, earning his doctorate in 1888 and created the deslandres table, which finds numerical patterns in spectral lines that paralleled the work of Johann Balmer and were to catalyse the development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century.

In 1868, Pierre Janssen&#x27;s solar observations had led him to report to the Académie des Sciences that &quot;It is no longer geometry and mechanics which dominate [in astronomy] but physics and chemistry.&quot; Such advice was sternly rejected by director of the Paris Observatory Urbain Le Verrier and the French government awarded Janssen a grant to establish an astrophysical observatory at Meudon on the outskirts of Paris with Janssen as the sole astronomer. In 1889, Le Verrier was succeeded by Amédée Mouchez who set to work to bring astrophysics into the mainstream by hiring Deslandres. Deslandres developed the spectroheliograph simultaneously with George Hale.

In 1898, he joined Janssen at Meudon, increasing the scientific staff by 100%. On Janssen&#x27;s death in 1907, Deslandres became director and embarked on a programme of expansion. Deslandres was the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1907-1909. At the outbreak of World War I in 1914, though already in his 60s, he returned to active service in the engineers as a major and later lieutenant colonel. In 1918, following the armistice, he resumed his office at Meudon until 1926 when its administration merged with that of the Paris Observatory, Mouchez assuming the role of director of both institutions until his retirement in 1929.

He remained active in research right up until his death. Fellow astronomer Raymond Michard observed that &quot;In his bearing, his character and his style of life Deslandres always remained more akin to the soldier (and the officer) than to the scholar.&quot;

<text>Phosphoglucomutase () is an enzyme that transfers a phosphate group on an α-D-glucose monomer from the 1 to the 6 position in the forward direction or the 6 to the 1 position in the reverse direction.

More precisely, it facilitates the interconversion of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate.

== Function ==

===Role in glycogenolysis===

After glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the phosphorolytic cleavage of a glucosyl residue from the glycogen polymer, the freed glucose has a phosphate group on its 1-carbon. This glucose 1-phosphate molecule is not itself a useful metabolic intermediate, but phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of this glucose 1-phosphate to glucose 6-phosphate (see below for the mechanism of this reaction).

Glucose 6-phosphate’s metabolic fate depends on the needs of the cell at the time it is generated. If the cell is low on energy, then glucose 6-phosphate will travel down the glycolytic pathway, eventually yielding two molecules of adenosine triphosphate. If the cell is in need of biosynthetic intermediates, glucose 6-phosphate will enter the pentose phosphate pathway, where it will undergo a series of reactions to yield riboses and/or NADPH, depending on cellular conditions.

If glycogenolysis is taking place in the liver, glucose 6-phosphate can be converted to glucose by the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase; the glucose produced in the liver is then released to the bloodstream for use in other organs. Muscle cells in contrast do not have the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase, so they cannot share their glycogen stores with the rest of the body.

===Role in glycogenesis===

Phosphoglucomutase also acts in the opposite fashion when blood glucose levels are high. In this case, phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate (which is easily generated from glucose by the action of hexokinase) to glucose 1-phosphate.

This glucose-1-phosphate can then react with UTP to yield UDP-glucose in a reaction catalyzed by UDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase. If activated by insulin, glycogen synthase will proceed to clip the glucose from the UDP-glucose complex onto a glycogen polymer.

==Reaction mechanism==

Phosphoglucomutase affects a phosphoryl group shift by exchanging a phosphoryl group with the substrate. Isotopic labeling experiments have confirmed that this reaction proceeds through a glucose 1,6-bisphosphate intermediate.

The first step in the forward reaction is the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the enzyme to glucose 1-phosphate, forming glucose 1,6-bisphosphate and leaving a dephosphorylated form of the enzyme. The enzyme then undergoes a rapid diffusional reorientation to position the 1-phosphate of the bisphosphate intermediate properly relative to the dephosphorylated enzyme. Substrate-velocity relationships and induced transport tests have revealed that the dephosphorylated enzyme then facilitates the transfer of a phosphoryl group from the glucose-1,6-bisphosphate intermediate to the enzyme, regenerating phosphorylated phosphoglucomutase and yielding glucose 6-phosphate (in the forward direction). Later structural studies confirmed that the single site in the enzyme that becomes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated is the oxygen of the active-site serine residue (see diagram below). A bivalent metal ion, usually magnesium or cadmium, is required for enzymatic activity and has been shown to complex directly with the phosphoryl group esterified to the active-site serine.

This formation of a glucose 1,6-bisphosphate intermediate is analogous to the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and 3-phosphoglycerate catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase, in which 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate is generated as an intermediate.

== Structure ==

While rabbit muscle phosphoglucomutase has served as the prototype for much of the elucidation of this enzyme&#x27;s structure, newer bacterium-derived crystal structures exhibit many of the same defining characteristics. Each phosphoglucomutase monomer can be divided into four sequence domains, I-IV, based on the enzyme’s default spatial configuration (see image at right).

Each monomer comprises four distinct α/β structural units, each of which contains one of the four strands in each monomer&#x27;s β-sheet and is made up only of the residues in a given sequence domain (see image at right). The burial of the active site (including Ser-116, the critical residue on the enzyme that is phosphorylated and dephosphorylated) in the hydrophobic interior of the enzyme serves to exclude water from counterproductively hydrolyzing critical phosphoester bonds while still allowing the substrate to access the active site.

==Disease relevance==

Human muscle contains two isoenzymes of phosphoglucomutase with nearly identical catalytic properties, PGM I and PGM II. One or the other of these forms is missing in some humans congenitally. PGM1 deficiency is known as PGM1-CDG or CDG syndrome type 1t (CDG1T), formerly known as glycogen storage disease type 14 (GSD XIV). The disease is both a glycogenosis and a congenital disorder of glycosylation. It is also a metabolic myopathy and an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism.

PGM deficiency is an extremely rare condition that does not have a set of well-characterized physiological symptoms. This condition can be detected by an in vitro study of anaerobic glycolysis which reveals a block in the pathway toward lactic acid production after glucose 1-phosphate but before glucose 6-phosphate. There are two forms of PGM1-CDG: 1.) exclusively myogenic, and 2.) multi-system (including muscles). 

The usual pathway for glycogen formation from blood glucose is blocked, as without phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-phosphate cannot convert into glucose-1-phosphate. However, an alternative pathway from galactose can form glycogen by converting galactose → galactose-1-phosphate → glucose-1-phosphate. This allows glycogen to form, but without phosphoglucomutase, glucose-1-phosphate cannot convert into glucose-6-phosphate for glycolysis. This causes abnormal glycogen accumulation in muscle cells, observable in muscle biopsy.

Although the phenotype and severity of the disease is highly variable, common symptoms include: exercise intolerance, exercise-induced hyperammonemia, abnormal glycogen accumulation in muscle biopsy, elevated serum CK, abnormal serum transferrin (loss of complete N-glycans), short stature, cleft palate, bifid uvula, and hepatopathy. 

A &quot;second wind&quot; phenomenon is observable in some, but not all, by measuring heart rate while on a treadmill. At rest, muscle cells rely on blood glucose and free fatty acids; upon exertion, muscle glycogen is needed along with blood glucose and free fatty acids. The reliance on muscle glycogen increases with higher-intensity aerobic exercise and all anaerobic exercise. 

Without being able to create ATP from stored muscle glycogen, during exercise there is a low ATP reservoir (ADP&gt;ATP). Under such circumstances, the heart rate and breathing increases inappropriately given the exercise intensity, in an attempt to maximize the delivery of oxygen and blood borne fuels to the muscle cell. Free fatty acids are the slowest of the body&#x27;s bioenergetic systems to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation, at approximately 10 minutes. The relief of exercise intolerance symptoms, including a drop in heart rate of at least 10 BPM while going the same speed on the treadmill, after approximately 10 minutes of aerobic exercise is called &quot;second wind,&quot; where increased ATP is being produced from free fatty acids. 

Another consequence of a low ATP reservoir (ADP&gt;ATP) during exercise, due to not being able to produce ATP from muscle glycogen, is increased use of the myokinase (adenylate kinase) reaction and the purine nucleotide cycle. The myokinase reaction produces AMP (2 ADP → ATP + AMP), and then the purine nucleotide cycle both uses AMP and produces more AMP along with fumarate (the fumarate is then converted and produces ATP via oxidative phosphorylation). Ammonia (NH3) is a byproduct in the purine nucleotide cycle when AMP is converted into IMP. During a non-ischemic forearm test, PGM1-CDG individuals show exercise-induced elevated serum ammonia (hyperammonemia) and normal serum lactate rise.

Studies in other diseases that have a glycolytic block have shown during ischemic and non-ischemic forearm exercise tests, that not only does ammonia rise, but after exercise, rises also in serum inosine, hypoxanthine, and uric acid. These studies supported that when the exercise is stopped or sufficient ATP is produced from other fuels (such as free fatty acids), then the ATP reservoir normalizes and the buildup of AMP and other nucleotides covert into nucleosides and leave the muscle cell to be converted into uric acid, known as myogenic hyperuricemia. AMP → IMP → Inosine → Hypoxanthine → Xanthine → Uric acid. Unfortunately, the studies on PGM1-CDG only tested for serum ammonia and lactate, so it is currently unknown definitively whether PGM1-CDG individuals also experience myogenic hyperuricemia.

<doc id="522328" wikidata="Q44795" url="?curid=522328" title="La Pampa Province">
<text>La Pampa () is a sparsely populated province of Argentina, located in the Pampas in the center of the country. Neighboring provinces are from the north clockwise San Luis, Córdoba, Buenos Aires, Río Negro, Neuquén and Mendoza.

==History==

In 1604 Hernando Arias de Saavedra was the first European explorer to reach the area; it was later explored by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera in 1662. But it was not until the 18th century that Spanish colonists established permanent settlements here.

Resistance of the local indigenous people prevented much expansion until the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. It did not cease until Julio Roca&#x27;s conquest of the desert in the 19th century. The territory was divided between the officers, and they erected the first Argentine settlements.

The &quot;Territorio Nacional de La Pampa Central&quot; was erected in 1884, containing the Río Negro Province and parts of other surrounding provinces. It had around 25,000 inhabitants. By 1915 there were 110,000 residents, a reflection of movement to that area. In 1945 the territory was divided and La Pampa became a province.

In 1952 its constitution was written and the province was renamed after Eva Peron. In 1955 after the government changed and the Peróns went into exile, both La Pampa and Chaco, which had been named for Juan Perón, were reverted to their original names.

==Geography==
It is noteworthy that this province is larger than Israel, Austria, Taiwan, Ireland or Greece, for example.
There are only two major rivers in the province: the Colorado (&quot;Red River&quot;) on the border with the Province of Río Negro, and the Salado (&quot;Salty River&quot;) crossing it. The Salado&#x27;s level has been dropping, as its tributaries in the Province of Mendoza are diverted for irrigation.

The general aspect of the central-eastern part of the province is that of a plain gently tilted to the east that is dissected by valleys. The surface of the plain has a calcrete crust. The valleys of La Pampa, known as the transverse valleys () are NE-SW oriented, with breadths of various kilometers and lengths of tens of kilometers. Some of the valleys host very large fossil inland dunes. Formerly functioning as windfunnels for sand at present these valleys are an ecotone region between the Dry and Humid Pampas.

While mostly flat, the province does also contains mountains like Sierra de Lihuel Calel, where a variety of landforms can be observed; these include inselbergs, flared slopes, domes, nubbins, tors, tafonis, and gnammas. Most of Sierra de Lihuel Calel is made up ignimbrite, a volcanic rock type that was violently erupted by ancient volcanoes.

===Climate===

Being located in the Pampas, the province has a cool temperate climate. In general, the province is dominated by two different types of climates: a temperate one in the east and a semi-arid one in the west. Precipitation generally decreases from east to west and from north to south. Being characterized by large thermal amplitudes, the climate of the province has continental characteristics, particularly in the west where thermal amplitudes are much larger. The general atmospheric circulation is one of the most important factors that influence the climate on a regional scale. During summer, the South Atlantic High is displaced to the southeast, which brings hot and humid air masses from the north and northeast. The South Pacific High in summer is responsible for bringing cooler air masses from the southwest which when these two contrasting air masses meet lead to precipitation occurring. In contrast, winters are dry due to the northward displacement of the South Atlantic high and the topographic barrier of the Andes north of 40oS which prevents frontal systems that bring precipitation from reaching the province. Any winds from the southwest during winter bring in cold and dry weather since most of the precipitation and humidity are released in the Andes. As such, most of the precipitation occurs during summer.

====Temperature====
Mean annual temperatures in the province range between although the thermal amplitude (difference between temperatures in the warmest and coldest months) is large. In summer, mean temperatures in the warmest month (January) range from in the north and northeastern parts to in the west and southwestern parts of the province. Temperatures tend to be cooler in the west owing to the higher altitudes. In winter, mean temperatures in the coldest month (July) range from in the north to in the west and southwest. The northern parts are the warmest parts of the province; absolute maximum temperatures can reach up to . The lowest temperatures ever recorded range from in the northeast to in the southwest.

====Precipitation====
One characteristic of the precipitation in the province is that most of the precipitation occurs from October to March with little precipitation during winter. Mean annual precipitation ranges from a low of in the southwest to in the northeast. Precipitation generally decreases from northeast to southwest. Most of the precipitation is caused by frontal systems. Precipitation is highly variable from year to year.

==Economy==
La Pampa, long Argentina&#x27;s most economically agricultural province, produced an estimated US$3.144 billion in output in 2006, or, US$10,504 per capita (almost 20% above the national average). Now, the GDP per capita of the province is of US$14.000.

Agriculture contributes a fourth to La Pampa&#x27;s economy, the most important activity being cattle ranching, with 3,632,684 (2002) head, which takes place all over the province. Other livestock include 202,428 sheep, 140,498 goats and 64,118 pigs.

The Northeast, on the more fertile lands, has also an important activity with wheat (10% of the national production), sunflower (13% of NP), maize, alfalfa, barley, and other cereals.

There&#x27;s also a dairy industry of 300 centres of extraction and 25 cheese factories, honey production, and salt extraction from salt basins.

La Pampa is home to hundreds of oil and gas wells, as well as deposits of sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and copper. Tourism is an underdeveloped activity, however. Visitors start at Santa Rosa and reach Lihué Calel National Park, &quot;Parque Luro Provincial Reserve&quot; or visit one of the many &quot;estancias&quot;, some of which are dedicated to agritourism.

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.

The Constitution of La Pampa Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the La Pampa Provincial Police.

==Political divisions==

The province is divided in 22 departments (Spanish: departamentos).

<text>Glycosylamines are a class of biochemical compounds consisting of a glycosyl group attached to an amino group, -NR2. They are also known as N-glycosides, as they are a type of glycoside. Glycosyl groups can be derived from carbohydrates. The glycosyl group and amino group are connected with a β-N-glycosidic bond, forming a cyclic hemiaminal ether bond (α-aminoether).

Examples include nucleosides such as adenosine.

<text>National Velvet is a novel by Enid Bagnold (1889–1981), first published in 1935. It was illustrated by Laurian Jones, Bagnold&#x27;s daughter, who was born in 1921. The novel tells the story of a teenaged girl who wins a horse racing competition. It was a best-seller, and adapted into a highly successful 1944 film and a 1960-62 television series.

==Plot summary==

&quot;National Velvet&quot; is the story of a 14-year-old girl named Velvet Brown, who trains and rides her horse, named The Piebald, to victory in the Grand National steeplechase.

The novel focuses on the ability of ordinary people, particularly women, to accomplish great things. Velvet is a teenager in the late 1920s, living in a small English coastal village in Sussex, dreaming of one day owning many horses. She is a high-strung, shy, nervous child with a delicate stomach. Her mother is a wise, taciturn woman who was once famous for swimming the English Channel; her father is a butcher.

Velvet&#x27;s best friend is her father&#x27;s assistant, Mi (Michael) Taylor, whose father – as Mrs. Brown&#x27;s swimming coach – helped her cross the channel. Mi formerly worked in stables and is familiar with the horse racing world. One day they both watch The Piebald jump over a five-foot-high cobbled fence to escape a field. Mi remarks that &quot;a horse like that&#x27;d win the National&quot;. Velvet becomes obsessed with winning the horse in an upcoming raffle and riding him to greatness.

In addition to inheriting several horses from one of her father&#x27;s customers, Velvet also wins The Pie, her dream horse. After riding him in a local gymkhana, she and Mi seriously consider entering the Grand National steeplechase at Aintree racecourse and train the Piebald accordingly.

Mi uses his connections to the horse training/racing world and obtains a fake clearance document for Velvet in the name of James Tasky, a Russian jockey. Velvet wins the race, but is disqualified for dismounting too soon after she slides off the saddle due to exhaustion. Her gender is discovered in the first-aid station.

The racing world is both dismayed and fascinated by a young girl&#x27;s winning its toughest race. Velvet and The Piebald become instant celebrities, with Velvet and her family nearly drowning in notoriety (echoing her mother&#x27;s unsought fame after swimming the English Channel), complete with merchandising. Velvet strongly objects to the publicity, saying The Piebald is a creature of glory who should not be cheapened in tabloid trash and newsreels. She insists that she did not win the race, the horse did, and she simply wanted to see him go down in history. The National Hunt Committee finds no evidence of fraud, exonerates all involved, and Velvet and her family return to their ordinary lives; or rather, Velvet goes on &quot;to her next adventures&quot;, for clearly she is a person to whom great things happen.

===Film adaptation===
The novel was made into a more or less faithful, highly successful film version in 1944, starring twelve-year-old Elizabeth Taylor and Mickey Rooney, with Donald Crisp, Anne Revere and a young Angela Lansbury. The screenplay was written by Helen Deutsch. In 2008 the film was voted the ninth best American film in the sports genre. In the film the horse, who was solid coloured, hence not a piebald (British English) or pinto (American English), was renamed The Pie.

===Radio adaptation===
&quot;National Velvet&quot; was presented on &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot; on the CBS radio network on 6 October 1949. The half-hour adaptation starred Roddy McDowell and Anne Whitfield.

===Television adaptation===
From 1960 to 1962, the novel was adapted into a thirty-minute American television series, with Lori Martin, Ann Doran and James McCallion. In this version her horse was named King. This aired on NBC for 52 episodes.

===Film sequel===

A 1978 film sequel, &quot;International Velvet&quot;, was made starring Tatum O&#x27;Neal as Sarah Brown, a young orphaned American teenager living in England with her aunt Velvet Brown (Nanette Newman) after Sarah&#x27;s parents die in a car accident. Sarah and Velvet purchase the descendant of The Pie after Sarah earns the money by working for Velvet&#x27;s boyfriend John. They name him Arizona Pie after Sarah&#x27;s home state. Working with Arizona Pie, Sarah is selected to represent Britain in the equine three-day Olympic event. While working with the horse with trainer Captain Johnson (Anthony Hopkins), she falls for an American competitor, Scott Saunders (Jeffrey Byron). Though distracted by him, she wins the event. Later, after getting engaged to Scott, Sarah returns to England and presents the medal to her aunt Velvet as a keepsake and introduces her and John to Scott.

<text>The Institution of Engineers of Ireland () or the IEI, is an engineering society primarily representing members based in Ireland. The institution is Ireland’s recognised organisation for accreditation of professional engineering qualifications under the Washington Accord, Sydney Accord, and Dublin Accord.

Membership of the institution is open to individuals based on academic and professional background and is separated into grades in accordance with criteria, including the Chartered Engineer and European Engineer titles.

The institution received its current legal name in 1969 by an Act of the Oireachtas. In October 2005 the institution adopted the operating name Engineers Ireland; the legal name is, however, unchanged.

== History ==

The history of the institution can be traced to 6 August 1835 when civil engineers met in Dublin; the result was the Civil Engineers Society of Ireland, in 1844 the society adopted the name the Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (ICEI). The institution received a royal charter on 15 October 1877, this being a significant milestone in obtaining international recognition and standing. In the early years of the Irish Free State Cumann na nInnealtóirí (The Engineers Association) was set up independently, in 1928, by incorporation under the Companies Act, 1908 to &quot;improve and advance the status and remuneration of qualified members of the engineering profession&quot; as it was felt that the ICEI&#x27;s charter prevented its negotiation of employment conditions and salary.

In 1927 the ICEI elected their first woman member when Iris Cummins was admitted to the organisation.

As time progressed it was realised that the institution and association might better advance engineering in Ireland by amalgamation of both into a single organisation which would represent a broader set of engineering disciplines, so discussions commenced in 1965, and resulted in &quot;The Institution of Civil Engineers of Ireland (Charter Amendment) Act, 1969&quot; leading to the redesignation of the unified institution as The Institution of Engineers of Ireland – Cumann na nInnealtóirí. Since this Act the institution has represented all branches of engineering in Ireland.

In 1997 the institution set up the Irish Academy of Engineering – official website, based at Bolton Street, Dublin Institute of Technology (Now Technological University Dublin).

== Mission ==

&quot;The institution promotes the art and science of engineering...&quot;, in particular:

<doc id="522343" wikidata="Q2546778" url="?curid=522343" title="Joel Hodgson">
<text>Joel Hodgson (born February 20, 1960) is an American writer, comedian and television actor. He is best known for creating &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; (&quot;MST3K&quot;) and starring in it as the character Joel Robinson. In 2007, &quot;MST3K&quot; was listed as &quot;one of the top 100 television shows of all time&quot; by &quot;Time&quot;.

From 2007 to 2013, Hodgson was part of the &quot;movie riffing&quot; project &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; with several of his fellow MST3K alumni, performing live and producing content for DVDs and direct download. He has also served as Creative Lead for Media at Pennsylvania technology firm Cannae.

==Early life and career==
Hodgson was born on February 20, 1960, in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, and later moved to Green Bay, Wisconsin. He was raised in an Evangelical Christian upbringing, and later claimed that the various shows his church would put on had a profound influence on his desire to become an entertainer. Hodgson began his career in seventh grade as a magician and ventriloquist. Joel performed for local events in Green Bay, and attended Ashwaubenon High School. Upon graduation, Hodgson moved to Minneapolis to attend Bethel University, Minnesota, to study Theatre and Mass Media. While there, Hodgson further developed his magic act by adding comedy and began opening for musical acts at Bethel as well as performing in coffee houses and comedy clubs. Hodgson cites a Theatre of the Absurd class at Bethel taught by Dr. David Horn for helping him crystallize the meaning of his comedy. In 1981, he won the Campus Comedy Contest and then the first annual Twin Cities Comedy Invitational in 1982. In November of the same year Hodgson moved to Los Angeles where he became a regular performer at the Comedy Store and the Hollywood Magic Castle, as well as the Comedy &amp; Magic Club. At the Comedy &amp; Magic Club, Hodgson was spotted by &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; producer Barry Sand and three months later, at age 22, had his network television debut. He later made four other appearances on the Letterman show, as well as four on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as a guest act. Hodgson also was a featured performer on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Eighth Annual Young Comedians Special&quot;, hosted by John Candy, along with Bill Maher, Paula Poundstone, and the Amazing Johnathan.

He worked at the Comedy Store while in LA, also doing traveling stand-up in San Jose, San Francisco, Detroit, Kansas City and Minneapolis. Hodgson left stand-up in 1985, citing the need for a creative sabbatical, and moved back to Minneapolis.

Between 1984 and 1988 – Hodgson&#x27;s &#x27;official&#x27; return to comedy – he built and sold sculptures, worked at a T-shirt factory, designed toys, and began designing and building props (including robots) for other comedians. In 1986 he co-wrote an HBO special with Jerry Seinfeld. He was also considered for the role of Woody Boyd in &quot;Cheers&quot;. He met Jim Mallon in 1987, and Mallon became production manager at the St. Paul UHF station KTMA Channel 23 in 1988. Hodgson was the first choice to portray &quot;Philo&quot; in the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic film &quot;UHF&quot;, but at the time of the filming in 1988, he had begun the production of a new form of television program for KTMA.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;==
Building on his gift for designing toys and other gizmos, Hodgson built three robot puppets and created &quot;MST3K&quot; in 1988. He starred as the show&#x27;s long-suffering but inventive protagonist, Joel Robinson, who in the backstory is responsible for creating his own robot companions. Hodgson cites the 1972 film &quot;Silent Running&quot; as an influence for the premise of the show.

&quot;MST3K&quot; originally aired on KTMA-TV, before becoming one of the first two shows to be picked up by the Comedy Channel, the forerunner of Comedy Central upon starting operations in 1989. The other show, also created and written by Hodgson, was the short-lived &quot;Higgins Boys and Gruber&quot;, a sketch comedy program that starred Steve Higgins, David Anthony Higgins and Dave Allen.

Hodgson surprised many fans when he left &quot;MST3K&quot; after its 107th episode, &quot;Mitchell,&quot; in 1993. Hodgson&#x27;s departure was scripted into the episode, with a robot, Gypsy, ejecting Joel from the Satellite of Love in an escape pod after incorrectly believing Joel&#x27;s captors were plotting to kill him. Michael J. Nelson replaced Hodgson as host for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. In contemporary interviews, Hodgson stated he was uncomfortable with acting and being in front of the camera. In 1999, he added that he and producer Jim Mallon had been fighting over creative control of &quot;MST3K&quot;. His departure allowed the show to continue and gave him the opportunity to focus on his preferred creation and production work rather than on performing, which he did only reluctantly.

Hodgson later made a surprise guest appearance in the season premiere for the final season of &quot;MST3K&quot; (&quot;Soultaker&quot;, episode 1001). The original &quot;MST3K&quot; ended its run in 1999.

Hodgson said in 2008 that he felt leaving &quot;MST3K&quot; &quot;was a bit of a personal tragedy&quot; and that he had &quot;...created the appearance to the press that I had other plans, but I didn&#x27;t. It was all to keep [&quot;MST3K&quot;] alive.&quot; He also stated that he felt his run on &quot;MST3K&quot; &quot;...was the perfect job.&quot; In a separate interview that year, Hodgson said of his departure from &quot;MST3K&quot;, &quot;I was, like, totally happy at &quot;Mystery Science Theater&quot;. I loved it. I wanted to stay, but I was basically having a fight with my partner, Jim Mallon. So we weren&#x27;t getting along and so I just felt like — I thought it really could possibly jeopardize the show. It would have been easy to create factions out of the group. And by that time it would not have been a fun show to work on. And so, I felt like I saw it coming and I just thought [leaving] was the best thing at the time.&quot;

==Work after &quot;MST3K&quot;==
After &quot;MST3K&quot;, Hodgson formed Visual Story Tools (VST) with his brother Jim Hodgson. They created a special for an interactive sketch comedy program called &quot;The TV Wheel&quot; for HBO, which Joel produced and hosted. It aired only once, on Comedy Central, after the last new Comedy Central episode of &quot;MST3K&quot;.

Over the years, Hodgson and his brother Jim maintained a side project that utilized the repurposing of movie footage with digital effects; codenamed &quot;jollyfilter.&quot;

Hodgson&#x27;s other post-&quot;MST3K&quot; projects and contributions include work as a writer on &quot;Trashed&quot;, &quot;Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;, &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, and &quot;Everything You Need to Know&quot;.

In 1999, Hodgson played a recurring role as a disco-loving clothing store salesman and DJ on the television show &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;.

Hodgson was featured as the cover story in the November 1996 issue of &quot;Genii&quot; magazine.
In 2007, he portrayed Blackbeard the pirate in two episodes of &quot;The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd&quot; and recently joined fellow &quot;MST3K&quot; alum Frank Conniff&#x27;s monthly comedy revue &quot;Cartoon Dump&quot;, helming his self-created puppet &quot;Dumpster Diver Dan.&quot;

He has since starred in the science fiction computer game &quot;&quot; as Scythe Commander Kane Cooper.

He reunited with Jerry Seinfeld as a guest on his web show, &quot;Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee&quot;.

In 2013, he reprised his role as Joel Robinson for a brief cameo appearance in two episodes of the fourth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, along with Trace Beaulieu as Crow.

From 2013 to 2018, he voiced recurring character Mayor Bill Dewey in the Cartoon Network animated series &quot;Steven Universe&quot;. Creator Rebecca Sugar, a lifelong fan of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, personally cast Hodgson.

In 2015, he appeared as Zalien Fletcher, a long-haired, laid-back, dim-witted engineer on the Paul Feig produced space comedy &quot;Other Space&quot;, which premiered on Yahoo! Screen on April 14, 2015. Fellow &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; alum Trace Beaulieu also appears as Zalien&#x27;s robot pal Art, an homage to &quot;MST3K&quot;.

==&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;==
On October 30, 2007, Hodgson announced he was starting a new show with the same &quot;riffing on bad movies&quot; premise as &quot;MST3K&quot; called &quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot;, together with former &quot;MST3K&quot; cast and crew members Trace Beaulieu, J. Elvis Weinstein, Frank Conniff and Mary Jo Pehl.

In 2012, he began touring a one-man show detailing his life and career through slides, video, and live interaction titled &quot;Riffing Myself&quot;.

&quot;Cinematic Titanic&quot; completed the final tour on December 30, 2013.

==&quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; revival==
On November 10, 2015, Hodgson launched a Kickstarter campaign to bring back &quot;MST3K&quot; for another season. The Kickstarter closed with over $6.3 million in funding (including &quot;add-on rewards&quot; offered through a separate site), allowing Hodgson to plan to produce fourteen new episodes.

The project was released on Netflix as &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return&quot; in April, 2017, and stars comedian Jonah Ray as Jonah Heston, alongside original co-star robots (puppets voiced by actors) Tom Servo, Crow, and Gypsy, much like when Hodgson hosted the show himself. Hodgson himself makes an appearance on this series as &quot;Ardy,&quot; although he is hidden under a HAZMAT suit in this character. The series was met with mainly positive reviews. and featured a nationwide live tour, titled &quot;MST3K Live! Watch Out for Snakes! Tour.&quot; Hodgson was present for each show, marking the first time he&#x27;s hosted the show in several years, and his first time hosting alongside Jonah Ray. The revived series ran for two seasons on Netflix, ending in November 2018.

On April 7, 2021, Hodgson launched a second Kickstarter campaign to make another revival of the series, intended for a new service called the Gizmoplex, with a possibility that he would host two episodes. The initial $2 million goal was met within the first 25 hours, with a total of $6.5 million at the end, enabling thirteen new episodes, two featuring Hodgson as Joel Robinson, a 3D film, and Halloween and Christmas specials. The season soft-launched to Gizmoplex members on March 4, 2022 with the season&#x27;s public premiere occurring on May 6, 2022. The first episode of the season in which Hodgson reprises his role as Robinson is the season&#x27;s sixth, featuring the 2019 film &quot;Demon Squad&quot;. The episode premiered on June 24, 2022.
