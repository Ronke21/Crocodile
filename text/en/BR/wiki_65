<text>Jesse Crowell (November 19, 1797 Bridgewater, Oneida County, New York – September 28, 1872 Albion, Calhoun County, Michigan) was a pioneer settler in Michigan, who platted Albion, Michigan, in 1836, was its first postmaster, and played an important role in the public affairs and the development of Albion. He is renowned as &quot;Albion&#x27;s Greatest Benefactor&quot;.

==Life==
His parents died when he was young. He removed to Albion, Oswego County, New York. He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Oswego Co.) in 1835.

Crowell came to Albion in 1835 with the intention to find water power and build a mill. He found the site at the forks of the Kalamazoo River.

Crowell was the main organizer, along with fellow pioneer settlers Tenney Peabody, Issachor Frost and D. L. Bacon, of the Albion Company - a firm which laid the plat for the town in 1836. In 1837, he negotiated for a post office and became the first postmaster. Through the Albion Company, Crowell sold property to other early settlers, donated land to establish churches, and established the Albion Burying Ground - later to become Riverside Cemetery. In 1838, he donated 60 acres (240,000 m2) of land and an additional 3 block for the Wesleyan Female Seminary, which later became Albion College. In its first years, Crowell served on the school&#x27;s board of directors and contributed liberally to the institution.

Crowell operated his Stone Mill from 1845 until his death, exporting products throughout the country. In 1917 this building was converted for use as a bank, removing the upper story, and applying a neoclassical front on the Superior St facade. The south wall of the Stone Mill may still be seen to this day.

He never married, he had no children, but gave generously of his time, money, and energy for the building of Albion.

Crowell is associated with many places in Albion. Crowell&#x27;s Michigan Avenue home was purchased by Dr. Stephen Munroe in 1873. A retired physician, Munroe added a mansard roof and third floor to the structure. The family of Albion State Bank president David A. Garfield were the final residents of the house. Mrs. Garfield was the niece of Dr. Munroe. The Garfield&#x27;s lived there until the house was demolished in 1926 to make way for Wesley Hall, a girls&#x27; dormitory for Albion College, later expanded for the use of all Albion College freshmen.

Crowell Park is located on North Superior Street. Named Washington Square in the original 1836 plat map and later known as Washington Park, this park was at one time extensively landscaped. Albion&#x27;s water tower is located on this hill-top location. In the center of the park is the cornerstone from Crowell&#x27;s stone mill.

Crowell School was named in his honor and opened in 1955 in the northwest corner of town. Because of declining student enrollment, this elementary school was converted for use as administrative offices in 2004.

Finally, the Crowell Block (303-307 Superior) in the Superior Street National Commercial Historic District downtown (listed on the National Register of Historic Places), was built by Crowell (c.1858) and was part of a row of three story commercial buildings between the Albion Opera House and the Brockway block on the corner of Superior and Erie.

<doc id="525023" wikidata="Q241595" url="?curid=525023" title="Lecithin">
<text>Lecithin ( ; from the Ancient Greek &quot;yolk&quot;) is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials.

Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid.

Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Théodore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine . Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological materials, including venous blood, human lungs, bile, roe, and brains of humans, sheep and chicken.

Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. Common sources include egg yolk, marine foods, soybeans, milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray.

==Production==
Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is soybean oil. Because of the EU requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. The main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. They are often abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially.

===Hydrolysed lecithin===
To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction.

===Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin===
As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) protein or DNA from the original GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable – in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the EU in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP).

==Properties and applications==
Lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. They can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested.

The major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are:
* 33–35% soybean oil
* 20–21% phosphatidylinositols
* 19–21% phosphatidylcholine
* 8–20% phosphatidylethanolamine
* 5–11% other phosphatides including phosphatidylserine
* 5% free carbohydrates
* 2–5% sterols
* 1% moisture

Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications.

Applications include:
* In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use.
* In animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization.
* In the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints.
* Lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an anti-sludge additive in motor lubricants, an anti-gumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries.

===Food additive===
The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as a food additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant.

In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. In doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent.

In the EU Lecithin is designated at food additive E322.

===Dietary supplement===
Lecithin contains dietary precursors to choline, an essential nutrient, which was formerly classified as a B vitamin (vitamin B4). Lecithin is a mixture of fats that contains phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, and the human body can convert phosphatidylcholine into choline. The choline content in lecithin can vary, but it&#x27;s found that phosphatidylcholine makes up about 25 to 35 percent of lecithin. Furthermore, only about 12 percent of phosphatidylcholine is actually choline. This adds up to a choline content of approximately 4 percent for lecithin. For example, 10 grams of lecithin has 2,500mg of phosphatidylcholine.

Phosphatidylcholine is approximately 13.7% choline; as such, about 342mg of choline is present per 10 grams of lecithin. Therefore, 10 grams of lecithin can be a source for the body to produce about the same amount of choline (342mg) as can be produced by the body from 2 egg yolks. The recommended intake of choline varies depending on age, sex, and physiological conditions, and is roughly 500 mg per day for adults.

Lecithin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA.

There is no robust, scientifically validated clinical research investigating the safety and effectiveness of high-dose lecithin supplementation in lactating women and their infants. A meta-analysis found no evidence that high doses of lecithin improved milk flow in breast-feeding mothers or infants, though concluded that &quot;higher maternal choline intake was likely to be associated with better child neurocognition and neurodevelopment.&quot;

Soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the US FDA only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory requirements for allergenic source labeling. An alternative source of lecithin, derived from sunflowers, is available as a dietary supplement for those with concerns about soy-based foods.

A 2003 review of randomized trials found no benefit of lecithin in people with dementia.

===Religious restrictions===
Soy-derived lecithin is considered by some to be &quot;kitniyot&quot; and prohibited on Passover for Ashkenazi Jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. This does not necessarily affect Sephardi Jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and &quot;kitniyot&quot; during Passover.

Muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure the source is halal. Lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of &quot;dhabihah&quot;.

Sunflower lecithin, sourced from the seeds of sunflowers, is entirely plant-based and may be an option for those with religious or cultural concerns regarding food intake.

<text>Joseph Paul Trippi (born June 10, 1956) is an American political strategist. A member of the Democratic Party, Trippi most notably served as campaign manager of Howard Dean&#x27;s 2004 presidential bid, and has served as a political commentator for CNN since 2018. He has worked on a number of prominent gubernatorial and United States Senate campaigns, including the successful bids of Jerry Brown for Governor of California and Doug Jones for U.S. Senate in Alabama.

== Early life and education ==
Trippi was born in Jamestown, New York and raised in Los Angeles, California. Trippi began his career in the mid-1970s working on several local elections in San Jose, California while he was attending San Jose State University, before leaving college a few credits shy of graduation to join the Ted Kennedy 1980 presidential campaign. During college he was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.

==Career==

Trippi served as Deputy Campaign Manager for Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley&#x27;s successful reelection bid in 1981 and his unsuccessful run in the 1982 California gubernatorial election. During Bradley&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign, Trippi installed one of the first in-house computers for a political campaign, the DEC-PDP11. Trippi used it for fundraising and targeting.

=== National ===
In 2010, Trippi was a senior strategist and media consultant in Jerry Brown&#x27;s successful run for reelection as California Governor. The Brown ads Trippi &amp; Associates produced received four Pollie awards for excellence in political media and &quot;Time&quot; named one ad, &quot;Echo,&quot; the best ad of 2010. Andrew Romanoff, who challenged the incumbent Senator Michael Bennet in the 2010 United States Senate election in Colorado, announced his campaign had hired Trippi as one of its four new consultants.

Trippi worked on a number of recent House victories for Representatives Tulsi Gabbard, Janice Hahn, Mark Takano, and Seth Moulton. Moulton, a former Marine from Massachusetts, won in a shocking come-from-behind upset. The campaign overcame millions in outside spending to beat 18-year incumbent John Tierney in the primary and Richard Tisei in the targeted general election. In a 2015 article from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Moulton recalled nationally renowned pollster Mark Mellman telling him to quit the race because it would be &quot;statistically impossible&quot; to win.

In 2017, Trippi worked on the special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions on behalf of former US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama Doug Jones. In his victory speech, Jones referred to Trippi as the &quot;greatest political consultant in the world&quot;.

After the historic come-from-behind victory in Alabama, Trippi worked for Democratic candidates in both of the 2018 United States Senate elections in Mississippi Trippi worked with Howard Sherman for seat currently held by incumbent Roger Wicker, and with former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy in the special election for the Senate seat vacated by Thad Cochran who decided to resign for health reasons. In 2018, Trippi worked on the campaign of Janet Garrett, a retired schoolteacher and union leader running to unseat the conservative founder of the Freedom Caucus, U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, in Ohio&#x27;s 4th congressional district.

Trippi currently serves as senior adviser to Senator Doug Jones and Senate candidate Teresa Tomlinson.

Trippi joined The Lincoln Project in July 2021 as a senior advisor.

=== International ===
Trippi has also worked on international political campaigns over the years. In 1993, Trippi worked for then-PASOK leader Andreas Papandreou’s successful campaign of Prime Minister of Greece, as well as for his son, George Papandreou in 2007. Trippi advised former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2005. In 2006, he worked for Romano Prodi on his winning race for Prime Minister of Italy.

In 2008, Trippi helped Morgan Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe’s opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change receive the most votes over Robert Mugabe in elections marred by violence. He also brought media attention to Mugabe’s democratic subversion and violence which led to a unity government and Tsvangarai becoming the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. As part of the unity government, Tsvangirai designated Roy Bennett as Deputy Minister of Agriculture on February 10, 2009. But Mugabe refused to swear Bennett into office, and three days later Bennett was arrested and charged with treason. Tsvangirai’s party reported that Bennett was being denied food in prison. Trippi led an international campaign to put pressure on Mugabe to release Bennett, and days after his release on March 12, Bennett thanked Trippi for his efforts.

Trippi was hired by the Libertas political party to work on their campaign for the 2009 European Parliament election.

In January 2010, Michael Hastings reported that Joe Trippi was working in Iraq to help launch a secular moderate Shiite party: the Ahrar party headed by Iyad Jamal Al-Din. A day later, Hastings also reported that 20 of Ahrar’s candidates had been struck from the ballot.

Beginning in October 2011, Trippi advised on the implementation of the recommendations of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, which was tasked with looking into the incidents that occurred during the period of unrest in Bahrain in February and March 2011, saying he &quot;had no problem working for them&quot; because they were &quot;one of the progressive countries in the Middle Eastern Gulf.&quot; The commission released a 500-page report which criticized security forces and provided various conclusions, observations, and recommendations to the government. Trippi ended his work in Bahrain in April 2012.

In 2011, Trippi provided strategic support for the campaign of Goodluck Jonathan in the Nigerian presidential election. In 2015, Trippi helped guide the new media strategy for the election of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, helping him build a following of over 800,000 Nigerians and leading CNN to declare Jonathan the “Facebook President.”

Trippi served as a senior strategist for Cyril Ramaphosa’s successful bid for African National Congress President in 2017, leading to Ramaphosa becoming the President of South Africa.

==Political campaigns==

===1984 presidential election===

Trippi remained in California to hold his first and only government position as Lieutenant Governor Leo T. McCarthy&#x27;s Deputy Chief of Staff, before overseeing several successes in Vice President Walter Mondale’s 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Starting with a come-from-behind victory at the Maine State Convention, Trippi eventually managed operations as the state director in Iowa and Pennsylvania, where Mondale won by 30 and 14 points respectively.

===1984–1988===

Following the Mondale campaign, Trippi joined Senator Ted Kennedy’s PAC, the Fund for a Democratic Majority, as Deputy Director under Paul Tully. At the time, Bob Shrum was chairman of the committee, but he soon resigned to start the media firm Caddell, Doak and Shrum, taking Trippi with him to be Vice President of the firm. During Trippi’s tenure at what became Doak and Shrum, the firm worked on several media campaigns for gubernatorial and senatorial candidates including those of Virginia Governor Gerald Baliles, Senator Alan Cranston of California, Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, and Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey. Shrum has attributed Trippi with conceiving and producing the famous spot on Cranston’s campaign, &quot;Zschau’s Greatest Hits&quot;.

===1988 presidential election===

In 1987, Trippi left Doak and Shrum to work on Gary Hart’s 1988 presidential bid with former colleague Paul Tully as deputy political director. He was assigned to manage reporters who surrounded the Hart home in Colorado, where Hart&#x27;s wife, Lee, was on the weekend when the Donna Rice story broke. Trippi lied to a Pinkerton guard in the presence of reporters at the gate of the property -- saying that residents of the home were about to go to sleep -- to cover the subsequent, surreptitious escape of Lee Hart, hiding on the floor of a van Trippi was driving. Two days later, as Gary and Lee Hart flew back from New Hampshire to Colorado to announce he was suspending his campaign, Trippi took part in staging a press motorcade to a canceled Hart event, a subterfuge intended to delay discovery of Hart&#x27;s flight.

He joined Dick Gephardt&#x27;s team as deputy campaign manager after Hart withdrew from the race. There, Trippi was instrumental in the creation of the &quot;Hyundai&quot; ad, a television spot which received praise for launching Gephardt from last place in the polls to winning the Iowa caucuses.

===1992 presidential election===

During the 1992 election cycle, Trippi consulted on the Presidential campaigns of Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Jerry Brown of California. For Brown&#x27;s campaign, Trippi and colleague Joe Costello orchestrated the first successful use of an 800 number in politics, raising $8 million by advertising the number on television and during debates.

===1992–2004===

Throughout the rest of the 1990s, Trippi worked as a media consultant and producer for multiple successful congressional races, including Ron Wyden’s run for Oregon&#x27;s Senate seat, Jim Moran&#x27;s in Virginia’s 8th district, and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky&#x27;s in Pennsylvania’s 13th district, which had been held by a Republican for almost 90 years.

In 2002, when five Democratic congressmen were redistricted into Republican majority districts and forced in contests against Republican incumbents, Trippi worked as a strategist and media consultant for Congressman Tim Holden, the only one of the five to win.

===2004 presidential election===

As national campaign manager for Vermont Governor Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in 2004, Trippi used online technology to organize what he envisioned would become &quot;the largest grassroots movement&quot; in presidential politics at the time. One of these methods included the blog entitled Blog for America where the campaign could communicate directly with supporters. Another was DeanTV, an online streaming platform playing videos and clips from the campaign trail. The campaign also developed technology for a social media site that enabled supporters to connect and campaign for Dean together. Through this innovative use of the Internet for small-donor fundraising, &quot;Dean for America&quot; raised more money than any Democratic presidential campaign to that point – all with donations averaging less than $100.

===2004–2017===

Trippi joined Jerry Brown again in 2006 serving as media consultant and strategist for his successful bid for California Attorney General. During this cycle he also produced the media for John Hall’s winning campaign for New York&#x27;s 19th district congressional seat. John Edwards hired Trippi in 2007 as a senior adviser for his 2008 presidential campaign. He also worked as media strategist and a senior adviser for Doug Jones&#x27; successful campaign in the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama, running for the seat left open when Jeff Sessions was appointed as Attorney General.

==Other work and advocacy==

Apart from campaign politics, Trippi has been involved in many other facets of the political world. He was named a fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics and at the New Politics Institute, a think tank of the New Democrat Network. He also serves on the advisory board to nonpartisan organization Why Tuesday? that encourages increased voter participation. He founded the consultancies Trippi &amp; Associates and Trippi International in 2004. He has had roles on various cable and broadcast networks, previously as a contributor on MSNBC and Fox News, and a political analyst on CBS News.

Trippi has consulted with a number of leading non-profits and corporations including the Humane Society of the United States, the American Cancer Society, Best Friends Animal Society, Monster.com, Toyota, Daimler AG, SES Americom, Corning Inc., LabCorp, IBM, Lionsgate Films, Best Buy, and Wave Systems.

==Personal life==

Trippi is a resident of the Eastern Shore of Maryland.

<doc id="525026" wikidata="Q2419461" url="?curid=525026" title="Island (Huxley novel)">
<text>Island is a 1962 utopian manifesto and novel by English writer Aldous Huxley, the author&#x27;s final work before his death in 1963. Although it has a plot, the plot largely serves to further conceptual explorations rather than setting up and resolving conventional narrative tension.

It is the account of Will Farnaby, a cynical journalist who is shipwrecked on the fictional island of Pala. &quot;Island&quot; is Huxley&#x27;s utopian counterpart to his most famous work, the 1932 dystopian novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. The ideas that would become &quot;Island&quot; can be seen in a foreword he wrote in 1946 to a new edition of &quot;Brave New World&quot;:

==Plot summary==
Englishman William Asquith &quot;Will&quot; Farnaby deliberately wrecks his boat on the shores of the Kingdom of Pala, an island halfway between Sumatra and the Andaman Islands, thus forcing his entry to this otherwise &quot;forbidden island&quot;. Farnaby, a journalist, political huckster, and lackey for the oil baron Lord Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Aldehyde, is tasked with persuading the island&#x27;s current queen—the Rani—to sell Aldehyde rights to Pala&#x27;s untapped oil assets. Farnaby awakens on the island with a leg injury, hearing a myna bird screaming &quot;Attention&quot;, when a local boy and girl notice him and take him for medical treatment to their grandfather, Dr. Robert MacPhail. Dr. Robert and a young man named Murugan Mailendra carry Farnaby to Robert&#x27;s house for a surprisingly successful hypnotherapy session led by Susila, Robert&#x27;s daughter-in-law and the mother of the two children. Susila&#x27;s husband Dugald (Robert&#x27;s son) recently died in a climbing accident, and Susila is still grappling with the grief.

Farnaby and Murugan recognise each other from a recent meeting with Colonel Dipa, the military dictator of a threatening country called Rendang-Lobo that neighbours Pala—another force coveting Pala&#x27;s oil. In private, Murugan reveals to Farnaby that he is in fact the Rani&#x27;s son and will be assuming control over Pala in a few days as its new Raja. Both the Rani and Murugan were raised outside of Palanese culture, however, and so both are largely westernised, with Murugan especially influenced by materialism and consumerist greed. Contrary to these philosophies, most Palanese islanders engage in peaceful living, intellectual pursuits, and deep spiritualism that avoids superstition. The kingdom has no military and its inhabitants have cultivated a nearly utopian society by blending the most applicable elements from western science and eastern Mahayana Buddhism, also adopting a multiple-parents child-rearing strategy of mutual adoption clubs (MACs), as well as a bilingual culture of English and Palanese. Palanese citizens strive to live always in the moment, to directly confront suffering and death, to meditate often, to engage shamelessly in coitus reservatus called &quot;maithuna&quot;, and to use &quot;moksha&quot;-medicine—a local psychedelic drug or entheogen—to help achieve these other goals. The Rani, however, who comes to visit Farnaby and is theatrical, larger-than-life, and more traditionally religious, is disgusted by these mainstream Palanese values and wishes to reform the country. Farnaby convinces her that Joe Aldehyde&#x27;s oil money will help her in her quest to &quot;save&quot; the nation from blasphemy.

As he recuperates, Farnaby reads Dr. Robert&#x27;s copy of the Old Raja&#x27;s &quot;Notes on What&#x27;s What, and What It Might be Reasonable to do about What&#x27;s What&quot;, which outlines Palanese practical philosophies for self-improvement and self-actualisation. He then tours the island&#x27;s educational system, which merges the sciences, the arts, and self-control techniques with the personal search for spiritual self-fulfillment. Dr. Robert recounts the island&#x27;s history, including how his own Scottish grandfather, Dr. Andrew MacPhail, was called to the island over a century ago to treat the Old Raja&#x27;s facial tumour using both trance-based mesmerization and actual surgery; this first brought scientific practices and the English language into Palanese culture.

Farnaby sees many other aspects of Palanese society as well, including a marionette version of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; called &quot;Oedipus in Pala&quot; with a revised and happy ending. The Palanese are so intimately connected with the reality of the moment that they even have taught the local myna birds to say &quot;Attention&quot; and &quot;Karuṇā&quot;, to remind the people to stay focused on the here-and-now and to have compassion. The Palanese people are well aware that they will likely be invaded soon by Colonel Dipa&#x27;s forces from Rendang, though they are resigned to pacifism. Farnaby too has been accepting the potential downfall of the island as a given, though he realises with discomfort that he may be an instrumental factor in causing such a downfall.

Farnaby begins to establish a strong bond with Susila, who directs Farnaby to re-explore his own troubled past, including the death of his wife, Molly, on the night he confessed to cheating on her and his whole hateful childhood; Susila guides him through his painful memories. In the meantime, Susila&#x27;s mother-in-law and Dr. Robert&#x27;s wife, Lakshmi, is now also dying, due to cancer. One night, when the Rani urgently sends a letter to Farnaby to meet with her, he decides to finally take a stand against the exploitation of the island by Aldehyde and Dipa, and so he ignores her letter, instead going to visit the quickly-fading Lakshmi who, surrounded by her family, finally dies.

Susila then invites Farnaby to try the &quot;moksha&quot;-medicine at last. His ensuing hallucinatory visions are vividly philosophical and unspeakably vibrant; he feels a loss of self in the oneness of everything and &quot;knowledgeless understanding&quot;, and he also horrifically watches a nearby mantis sexually cannibalise her partner, before Susila encourages him to let the medicine help him see the beauty in all things. As morning approaches, they suddenly hear gunfire and spot a caravan of military vehicles. Murugan&#x27;s voice through a loudspeaker encourages the people to remain calm and welcome the invading forces, while announcing the formation of the new United Kingdom of Rendang and Pala with himself as the monarch and Colonel Dipa as its prime minister. The caravan stops to execute Dr. Robert and then moves on, Susila horror-stricken, as a myna cries &quot;Attention&quot; one final time.

==Major themes==
&quot;Island&quot; explores many of the themes and ideas that interested Huxley in the post-World War II decades and were the subject of many of his nonfiction books of essays, including &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, and &quot;The Perennial Philosophy&quot;. Some of these themes and ideas include overpopulation, ecology, modernity, democracy, mysticism, entheogens, and somatotypes.

Common background elements occur in both &quot;Island&quot; and &quot;Brave New World&quot;; they were used for good in the former and for ill in the latter. Such elements include:

Huxley&#x27;s mother Julia Huxley died when he was ten and she was 46. She wrote a letter to Aldous as she was dying and he carried this with him for the rest of his life. It included the thought &quot;Judge not too much and love more&quot;. Scholars of Aldous&#x27;s works see his mother&#x27;s death in his cynical attitude and his books including &quot;Brave New World&quot; and the utopian &quot;Island&quot;.

The culture of Pala is the offspring of a Scottish secular humanist medical doctor, who made a medical visit to the island in the 19th century and decided to stay and work with its Raja, who embodies the island&#x27;s Mahayana Buddhist tradition, to create a society that merges the best of East and West. The Old Raja&#x27;s treatise, &quot;Notes on What&#x27;s What&quot;, is a book within the book that explains Pala&#x27;s philosophical foundations.

A central element of Palanese society is restrained industrialisation, undertaken with the goal of providing fulfilling work and time for leisure and contemplation. For the Palanese, progress means a selective attitude towards technology, which Huxley contrasts to the underdeveloped poverty of the neighbouring island of Rendang, and with the alienating overdevelopment of the industrialised West, chiefly through Will Farnaby&#x27;s recollections of London. The Palanese embrace modern science and technology to improve medicine and nutrition, but have rejected widespread industrialisation. For example, hydroelectricity is made available for refrigeration, so that surplus fresh food can be stored, improving nutrition and protecting against food shortages. Huxley viewed this selective modernisation as essential for his &quot;sane&quot; society, even if it means that such a society is unable to militarily defend itself from its &quot;insane&quot; neighbours who wish to steal its natural resources.

The Palanese also circumspectly incorporated the use of &quot;moksha medicine&quot;, a fictional entheogen taken ceremonially in rites of passage for mystical and cosmological insight. The moksha mushroom is described as &quot;yellow&quot; and not &quot;those lovely red toadstools&quot;, e.g. the &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;; this description of the moksha medicine is suggestive of &quot;Psilocybe&quot; mushrooms, a psychoactive that captivated Huxley during the latter half of his life. The recommended dosage of 400 mg, however, is in the dosage range of mescaline as opposed to psilocybin. Huxley had also been fascinated towards the end of his life by the potential benefit to humanity of substances such as mescaline and LSD. &quot;Brave New World&quot; and most of Huxley&#x27;s other books were written before he first tried a psychedelic drug in 1953.

Many of the ideas used to describe Pala as a utopia in &quot;Island&quot; appear also in &quot;Brave New World Revisited&quot;&#x27;s last chapter, which aims to propose actions which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into a totalitarian world like the one described in &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

Huxley used a scene of two mantids (&quot;Gongylus gongyloides&quot;) mating to make philosophical observations about the nature of death. In another memorable scene, Will Farnaby watches a Palanese version of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; with a little girl. Will points out that in his version Oedipus pokes his eyes out. The girl replies that that is silly, since all the king had to do was stop being married to his mother.

<text>High technology (high tech or high-tech), also known as advanced technology (advanced tech) or exotechnology, is technology that is at the cutting edge: the highest form of technology available. It can be defined as either the most complex or the newest technology on the market. The opposite of high tech is &quot;low technology&quot;, referring to simple, often traditional or mechanical technology; for example, a slide rule is a low-tech calculating device. When high tech becomes old, it becomes low tech, for example vacuum tube electronics. Further, high tech is related to the concept of mid-tech, that is a balance between the two opposite extreme qualities of low-tech and high tech. Mid-tech could be understood as an inclusive middle that combines the efficiency and versatility of digital/automated technology with low-tech&#x27;s potential for autonomy and resilience.

Startups working on high technologies (or developing new high technologies) are sometimes referred to as deep tech; the term may also refer to disruptive innovations or those based on scientific discoveries.

High tech, as opposed to high-touch, may refer to self-service experiences that do not require human interaction.

== History ==

The phrase was used in a 1958 &quot;The New York Times&quot; story advocating &quot;atomic energy&quot; for Europe: &quot;... Western Europe, with its dense population and its high technology ...&quot; Robert Metz used the term in a financial column in 1969, saying Arthur H. Collins of Collins Radio &quot;controls a score of high technology patents in a variety of fields&quot; and in a 1971 article used the abbreviated form, &quot;high tech&quot;.

A widely used classification of high-technological industries was provided by the OECD in 2006. It is based on the intensity of research and development activities used in these industries within OECD countries, resulting in four distinct categories.

In the 21st century, the high tech industry is a significant part of several advanced economies. The Israeli economy has the highest ratio in the world, with the high tech sector accounting for 20% of the economy. High tech makes up 9.3% of the American economy according to Statista and CTech.

== Ranking of startup ecosystems ==
Multiple cities and hubs have been described as global startup ecosystems. GSER publishes a yearly ranking of global startup ecosystems. The study does yearly reports ranking the top 40 global startup hubs.
== List of countries by high tech exports ==

The following is a list of the 15 largest exporting countries of high tech products by value in millions of United States dollars, according to the United Nations.

<text>The Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks are an Australian professional rugby league club based in Cronulla, in the Sutherland Shire, Southern Sydney, New South Wales. Cronulla compete in the National Rugby League (NRL), Australasia&#x27;s premier rugby league competition. The Sharks, as they are commonly known, were admitted to the New South Wales Rugby League premiership, predecessor of the Australian Rugby League and the current National Rugby League competition, in January 1967. The club competed in every premiership season since then and, during the Super League war, joined the rebel competition before continuing on in the re-united NRL Premiership. The Sharks have been in competition for 56 years, appearing in four grand finals, winning their first premiership in 2016 after defeating the Melbourne Storm at Stadium Australia.

==History==

In 1967 the New South Wales Rugby Football League (NSWRFL) added two new clubs to the competition, Cronulla-Sutherland and Penrith, the first to join the competition since Parramatta and Manly were admitted 20 years earlier in 1947.

Founded by Peter Burns, Cronulla debuted in 1967 wearing a sky blue jersey adorned with a white V and red numbers on the back, at the then club home ground of Sutherland Oval, under the captaincy of multiple premiership-winner Monty Porter and the coaching of Ken Kearney. Cronulla earned immediate recognition when they beat Eastern Suburbs at the Sydney Sports Ground in their first match. They had only two more wins, against Norths and Parramatta, and finished last on the competition table.

In mid-1968 the club moved permanently to Endeavour Field at Woolooware, and became the only club in Sydney to own their own ground. Their first match there was against Parramatta and the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks won 10–7.
===1970s===
Cronulla made their first grand final in 1973 against the Manly Sea Eagles losing 10–7. Cronulla met the Manly club again in the 1978 grand final, leading 7–2 well into the second half, before Manly came back and brought the scoreboard to 7–11. It took a late penalty goal from Steve Rogers to level scores at 11-all by full-time. The replay saw the Sharks opportunity pass by as they fielded a much-weakened team due to further injuries, eventually being shut-out by Manly 16–0. Cronulla were without suspended stars Greg Pierce and Dane Sorensen in both games, while hooker John McMartin, fullback Mick Mullane and Barry Andrews were all injured for the replay.

===1980s===
Cronulla suffered major financial trouble in 1983, with the NSWRL appointing an administrator and providing a loan. Western Suburbs and Newtown, both in a similar predicament, were refused a loan, with Newtown being forced out of the competition. Cronulla also made the final of the mid-week KB Cup, but lost again to Manly, 26–6.

In 1985, Cronulla was buoyed by the arrival of &#x27;super coach&#x27; Jack Gibson, who had coached Easts and Parramatta to premierships. Gibson left the club in good shape in 1987, with the promise fulfilled in 1988 when Cronulla won the minor premiership, led by veteran second-rower Gavin Miller, who was named Dally M Player of the Year, and Rothmans Medal winning halfback, Barry Russell. However, Russell dislocated his shoulder two weeks before the finals, and missed the semi-final where Cronulla went down to Canterbury. He was rushed back in for the final against Balmain, but he was severely hampered by the injury, and Cronulla were bundled out. A bright spot for the Sharks, though, was the selection in the Australian team of Miller, and young centres, Ettingshausen and Mark McGaw.

In 1989, Cronulla sneaked into the finals after thrashing Illawarra 46–14 in the final round, followed by a memorable 38–14 victory over the Brisbane Broncos in the play-off for fifth position. However, they could not repeat the performance in their semi-final against eventual premiers Canberra, in what was their third game in seven days. Gavin Miller was rewarded for another great year with both the Dally M Player of the Year award and the Rothmans Medal.

===1990s===
Cronulla again dropped into a period of poor form and financial trouble in 1990, but the appointment as coach of rugby league Immortal, Arthur Beetson, in 1992 helped turn the on-field problems around. He helped develop a batch of promising players, including five-eighth Mitch Healey, fullback David Peachey, winger Richie Barnett, second-rower Sean Ryan, prop Adam Ritson, and hooker Aaron Raper, son of another Immortal, Johnny Raper. However, Cronulla were forced into receivership in 1993.

Beetson was replaced as coach in 1994 by John Lang, a former Australian hooker, and coach of the Brisbane Easts team. Lang brought halfback, Paul Green, down from Brisbane with him. A golden age for the club had begun, signalled by the two lower grade teams (President&#x27;s Cup and Reserve grade) winning their competitions. During John Lang&#x27;s coaching period, from 1994 to 2001, Cronulla made the semi-finals every year except for 1994 and 1998. The club had a glamorous image and attracted record crowds, with a corresponding financial improvement.

In 1995, Cronulla were one of the first clubs to join the Super League competition, which kicked off after protracted legal battles and much bitterness, in 1997. The club was motivated by a dissatisfaction with the perceived favouritism of the NSWRL administration towards other clubs, and a still-risky financial situation.

They reached the inaugural – and only – grand final of the ten-team Super League competition, only to lose to a vastly superior Brisbane side 26–8 in Brisbane. The game was notable for being the first grand final to be played outside Sydney. The club rejoined the reunited National Rugby League competition in 1998.

Arguably Cronulla&#x27;s best season ever was in 1999, when they again won the Minor Premiership and the J. J. Giltinan Shield in convincing fashion. Cronulla-Sutherland easily accounted for the Brisbane Broncos in the quarter-final, and led 8–0 in the grand final qualifier against arch rivals the St George Illawarra Dragons before eventually losing 8–24. Following the season, a planned merger with South Sydney was met with staunch opposition from both clubs, and Cronulla was retained for the rationalised 14-team 2000 competition. Also in 1999, the Cronulla-Sutherland name was dropped, and the club was simply known as the &quot;Sharks&quot;, and would be known as this until the end of 2002.

===2000s===
Cronulla lost the grand final qualifier in similar circumstances in 2001, to eventual premiers Newcastle. The year was marked by the sudden rise of halfback Preston Campbell, who was named Dally M Player of the Year, despite being a fringe first grader at the start of the season.

In 2002, John Lang was replaced by Australian coach Chris Anderson, who had led Canterbury Bulldogs and Melbourne Storm to premierships. The following two years were the most acrimonious in the club&#x27;s history. The first year was almost an on-field success, as Anderson retained the core of John Lang&#x27;s team, and the Sharks again reached the grand final qualifier. However another heartbreaking loss to New Zealand, the replacement of halfback Preston Campbell – a crowd favourite – with former Melbourne halfback Brett Kimmorley, and a string of released players signaled trouble for 2003.

This was realised with the sudden mid-season departure of long-time stalwarts Nick Graham and Dean Treister. The Sharks finished 11th, suffering a record 74–4 loss to Parramatta in a match marred by the controversial performance of referee Shayne Hayne. Three Cronulla players were sent from the field, including Sharks captain David Peachey, for ignoring the referee&#x27;s instructions. Constant infighting between the board and the coach led to Anderson&#x27;s departure at the end of the season.

The same year the club&#x27;s name reverted to Cronulla-Sutherland, Chris Anderson was replaced by Stuart Raper, another son of Johnny Raper, and the coach of the President&#x27;s Cup-winning team in 1994. A loyal clubman, he instantly brought a revival in club and supporter spirit. However, Raper&#x27;s apparent focus on team harmony rather than results led to Cronulla&#x27;s win percentage worsening, from 49% (24 wins 27 losses) under Anderson, to 43% (31 wins 42 losses).

Steve Rogers, the CEO of the Cronulla Sharks and a former club legend, died on 3 January 2006 at the age of 51 of a &quot;mixture of prescription drugs and alcohol&quot;. In April, 2006, the NSW state coroner ruled that the death was accidental.

On 21 April 2006, after much work and lobbying carried out by then-Chairman Barry Pierce and Sharks board member Brian Quinn, Peter Costello, on behalf of the Federal Government, announced they would be funding a $9.6 million upgrade to Toyota Park. The funds were primarily used to construct the Southern Stand which was never completed but later named the Monty Porter Stand.

Cronulla finished the 2006 season in disastrous fashion. After winning 8 out of 9 games in the middle of the season and climbing to near the top of the ladder, the team experienced the worst losing streak in the club&#x27;s history, losing their last 10 consecutive games. In a see-sawing match to finish a tumultuous season, the Sharks in their final game coming back from 26–0 down only to lose 26–24 to Canberra. A missed penalty goal in the dying seconds of the match would have sent the game into extra-time, allowing the chance for Cronulla to equal the biggest single-game comeback in the history of top-level rugby league in Australia.

On 22 September 2006, the Sharks Board ended weeks of speculation over the future of Coach Stuart Raper by sacking him as first-grade coach and handing him a sizeable payout, making him the second consecutive coach to receive such a payout. On 26 September, Australian Test Coach Ricky Stuart signed a three-year deal to coach the Sharks as of 2007, replacing Raper.

Round one of the 2007 NRL season saw Cronulla-Sutherland break their 10-game losing streak against the Penrith Panthers with an 18–0 victory at Toyota Park. Ricky Stuart led the Sharks to fifth on the ladder at the halfway mark of the season surprising many critics. Towards the end of the season, Cronulla plunged to 15th on the league ladder, slumping to seven straight losses. The season ended with the Sharks in 11th place, rounding off a heartbreaking season, with the club losing no less than nine matches by 4 points or less.

Cronulla-Sutherland had a strong season in 2008, finishing the season in equal first spot (third on for and against). They had one of the best defensive records, but one of the worst attacking records in the league. They had an excellent start to the season, beating defending grand finalists Manly and premiers Melbourne in away games in the first two rounds. After a comprehensive 36–10 victory over Canberra in the Qualifying Final at Toyota Stadium, Cronulla were beaten 28–0 by Melbourne (who later were found to be over the salary cap and cheating) in the Preliminary Final at the Sydney Football Stadium. This was a disappointing end to an otherwise successful season.

During the 2009 season Cronulla&#x27;s dire financial problems became public knowledge. Asset-rich, owning its stadium and the surrounding land, but with cash flow problems due to its low average home gate and poor on-field performances in recent seasons, the club announced plans for a partial relocation to the Central Coast, which was rebuffed by the NRL. It was to split home games for the 2010–14 seasons among:

* 6 at Endeavour Field, to include local derbies with the St George Illawarra Dragons and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs,
* 5 at Central Coast Stadium in Gosford, Central Coast, and
* 1 at Hindmarsh Stadium in Adelaide, South Australia.

In May 2009, an ABC Four Corners investigation revealed the Sharks players involvement in a group sex scandal on a pre-season tour in 2002. The club further slid into crisis when it also emerged that CEO Tony Zappia had allegedly punched a female staff member and joked about it. Zappia and Coach Ricky Stuart also then attempted to bully the female staff member into retracting her complaint.

Zappia and Stuart were also investigated for their role around unusual financial transactions with Clint Elford, a fan who falsely claimed to be terminally ill, and who had sent money to Zappia and Stuart to spend on the Sharks . Elford was subsequently found guilty of fraud and Stuart refused to answer questions when the NRL launched an investigation. CEO Tony Zappia was investigated and subsequently sacked for his role.

On 26 May 2009 businessman Damian Irvine, together with a fresh board of directors, took over control of the club as the St George bank were threatening to foreclose.

They recorded 9 straight losses after a win in Round 1 in 2009 and despite a midseason revival with four straight wins, the Cronulla side slipped to ten straight defeats to equal the club&#x27;s worst losing streak. One of these losses caused great controversy as the Sharks, playing against Manly, were forced to field just 12 men for most of the game after Luke Douglas was sent off by referee Phil Haines for a careless high tackle. The Sharks managed to avoid the wooden spoon in 2009 when the Roosters were soundly beaten by the Cowboys in the final round, resulting in a lower overall standing than the Sharks. Avoiding last position was a rare positive in a horror season for the Cronulla club.

===2010s===

===2010===
The start of the 2010 season saw Cronulla return confident of turning around recent disappointing results, however on-field performance remained poor. After the board developed a plan to refinance debt and a long-term financial strategy, Richard Fisk resigned in June 2010 due to his failure to find common ground with Chairman Irvine and his Board and a failure by Fisk to refresh the commercial area of the club. The club&#x27;s head coach, Ricky Stuart, also tendered his resignation and was replaced towards the back end of the season by his then-assistant coach Shane Flanagan.

Promising wing/centre Blake Ferguson was criticised for comments about wanting to leave the club in order to achieve success. On Tuesday, 20 July Ricky Stuart left the Sharks for the rest of the season after admitting he could get no more out of the players and had &quot;lost&quot; them. Chairman Irvine opted to give a chance to Assistant NSW and Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan. After departing, Stuart also cited a fractured relationship with Chairman Damian Irvine as a reason for his departure despite the club making positive strides off-field under his guidance and commitment and Irvine making funds available to back Stuart in the player market as he wished.

===2011===
The 2011 season started so promising for the club. The addition of Wade Graham at five-eighth and New Zealand international Jeremy Smith to a pack already containing two origin players promised an end to the Sharks&#x27; status as cellar-dwellers. Despite being humiliated by Canberra at Canberra Stadium in round one, 40–12, the club won its next two matches. They beat defending premiers St. George Illawarra 16–10 at home in round two, and smashed Penrith 44–12 at Centerbet Stadium. Missing a number of first-team starters due to injury, Cronulla then lost five in a row to the New Zealand Warriors (26-18), Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (19-13), Newcastle Knights (24-20), North Queensland Cowboys (30-12), and South Sydney (31-12), dropping down the table, from 9th to 15th.

They broke their hoodoo in round ten, when they beat the struggling Sydney Roosters 18–4 at Toyota Stadium. They were again disappointing in round eleven, when they were defeated 40-6 by Parramatta at Parramatta Stadium. Despite losing 14–8 to the Storm in round 12, they were much improved and forced Melbourne into a classic showdown at AAMI Park in Melbourne. They then faced Brisbane at home in round 13, going down 34–16, before a bye in round 14 gave them the chance to regroup. While the Sharks were taking a much needed break skipper Paul Gallen led the NSW Blues Origin team to a memorable 18–8 victory over Queensland. He then played outstandingly for the Sharks in their round 15 match against Canterbury-Bankstown just three days after the State of Origin match, a game in which Cronulla beat Canterbury-Bankstown 26–10. The next four weeks saw a turnaround of the club&#x27;s performance, with victory over the Gold Coast Titans 36-12 and the South Sydney Rabbitohs 24–4, before they took revenge against the Canberra Raiders 26–12.

===2012===
Cronulla lost their two props for the 2012 season, Origin representative Kade Snowden to Newcastle and Luke Douglas signing for the Gold Coast Titans. Captain Paul Gallen&#x27;s transformation into an Origin prop alleviated this problem somewhat, and the Sharks were active in the player market, signing prop Jon Green from St George, former Shark Isaac de Gois, prop Mark Taufua from Newcastle, halfback Jeff Robson from Parramatta and props Bryce Gibbs and Andrew Fifita from Wests Tigers.

2012 began very well for the club under Chairman Damian Irvine, Coach Shane Flanagan. The recruitment by Mooney and Flanagan paid dividends with new recruits Jeff Robson, Andrew Fifita, Todd Carney, Ben Ross, Isaac De Gois and Mark Taufua taking pressure off Paul Gallen allowing him to hit a purple patch of form. The club won 6 matches in a row for the first time in over a decade and after 8 rounds were sitting third on the table as the highest placed Sydney based franchise.

A difficult State of Origin period saw injuries to captain Paul Gallen and star Todd Carney. Cronulla struggled to recover and struggled in the back half of the year, however still capped a remarkable turnaround by qualifying for their first finals series in 4 years, losing to Canberra in week one. The match notable for seeing Paul Gallen outplayed by young rival Josh Papalii and Todd Carney injuring his Achilles.

Sponsorship deals with SHARK Energy Drink, Fishermans Friends, and Luxbet flooded in and helped the financial situation off-field, with the close of Season 2012 seeing Shane Flanagan emerge as one of the game&#x27;s leading up and coming head coaches and his mentor Damian Irvine the game&#x27;s leading young administrator.

===2013===
At the beginning of Season 2013, Irvine stood down as chairman on learning of the questionable operational and duty of care practices of coach Shane Flanagan, and Darren Mooney during 2011 which exposed the club to the ASADA scandal. Flanagan was stood down and Peter Sharp stepped up to the head coaching role. Flanagan returned in 2013, a season in which the Sharks qualified for the competition semi finals, before he was forced to serve a 9-month suspension handed down by the NRL for breaches of basic governance and duty of care practices, thus validating the strong ethical stance made by Irvine and the board in March 2013.

Sharp again took over the reins, before resigning mid season the week after the club&#x27;s greatest comeback victory, with the team coming from 22 nil down to beat the Brisbane Broncos 24–22. Following that win, a photo went viral of Sharks playmaker Todd Carney pretending to urinate into his own mouth. Just one day after Carney was stood down by Cronulla CEO Steve Noyce, Sharp resigned as interim head coach and was replaced by James Shepherd.

===2014–2015===
The 2014 season saw a myriad of struggles for Cronulla on the field, with injuries and the suspension of five players involved in the supplements scandal of 2011, missing games at the back end of the season. Cronulla finished 2014 with the Wooden Spoon.

In 2015, the club climbed the ladder to eventually finish 6th with two wins over eventual minor premiers Sydney Roosters and 2014&#x27;s premiers South Sydney. 2015 was also the year Flanagan was reappointed as coach of Cronulla after sitting out the 2014 NRL season. The club would reach the second week of the finals series where they were defeated 39-0 by North Queensland in Townsville.

===2016===
The 2016 NRL season started with a 20–14 loss over 2015 premiers, North Queensland Cowboys. This was followed by a 30–2 win over the St. George Illawarra Dragons and a loss to Manly Warringah, 22–12. Cronulla then went on to win 15 games in a row from Round 4 against the Melbourne Storm to Round 21, against the Gold Coast Titans, resulting in an 18-all draw. This was the largest win streak in the club&#x27;s history. During this period Cronulla equaled their largest win score by defeating the Newcastle Knights 62–0.

They then went on to win 1 out of their last 5 games resulting in a drop from 1st to 3rd. In round 26, the Cronulla-Sutherland and Melbourne Storm faced off in a minor premiership showdown in which the Melbourne Storm won 26–6 in AAMI Park. They went on to defeat the Raiders in the Week 1 qualifying final 16-14 and earning the week off. Advancing to the Preliminary final, they defeated defending premiers North Queensland Cowboys 32–20 at the Sydney Football Stadium. They would face and defeat the Melbourne Storm in the 2016 NRL Grand Final. Cronulla, after leading 8–0 at half-time, prevailed in a gripping affair 14–12 to claim their first premiership in the club&#x27;s 50-year history. Cronulla second rower Luke Lewis was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as Man of the Match.

Soon after the Maiden premiership victory stat player Ben Barba tested positive for Cocaine and was sacked from the club. Chairman Damian Keogh, who rose to the position on a platform of promising good governance and increased commercial experience garnered from his role as CEO of HOYTS Australia, was also arrested for possession of Cocaine whilst in Sydney&#x27;s CBD and resigned from the position of Sharks Chairman as a result.

===2017 World Club Challenge and 2017 season===
Cronulla played Wigan Warriors at the DW Stadium on 19 February 2017, losing 22–6 to a strong Wigan side. In the 2017 NRL season, Cronulla reached the finals. In week one, Cronulla played against North Queensland in the elimination final. Cronulla went on to be upset 15-14 and were eliminated from the finals ending their premiership defence.

===2018 and financial struggles===
In the 2018 NRL season, Cronulla-Sutherland finished 4th on the table and qualified for the finals. The club would eventually reach the preliminary final but were defeated by Melbourne 22–6 at AAMI Park.

In November 2018, the Sharks sacked 10 staff members after $3m loss for 2018 season.

On 19 December 2018, Cronulla head coach Shane Flanagan was de-registered as a coach indefinitely for failing to adhere to the conditions of his suspension in 2014. The NRL integrity unit had found that Flanagan had sent more than fifty emails exchanged between Flanagan, club management and the football department which was strictly against the conditions of his suspension which included that Flanagan was to have no contact or involvement with the club during his ban. The NRL also fined Cronulla $800,000 as punishment.

During the 2019 preseason, on 29 November, it was confirmed that Cronulla would be forced into sacking 10 staff members to help their financial situation. It was reported that Cronulla had lost $3 million, despite being given support of the NRL.

===2019===
On 31 July 2019, it was revealed by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that Cronulla would be moving their home games away from Shark Park for two seasons as part of the club&#x27;s redevelopment of the Cronulla Leagues Club and Shark Park itself.

At the end of the 2019 regular season, Cronulla finished 7th on the table with 12 wins and 12 losses and qualified for the finals. In the elimination final against Manly, Cronulla lost 28–16 at Brookvale Oval which ended their season.

===2020s===

===2020===
Cronulla-Sutherland finished 8th on the table in the 2020 NRL season and qualified for the finals after recovering from a poor start to the year. Cronulla were then eliminated in the first week of the finals losing to the Canberra Raiders 32–20 at Canberra Stadium.

===2021===
Cronulla started the 2021 NRL season two wins from their opening five games. Following the club&#x27;s 28–16 loss against the Sydney Roosters, head coach John Morris was terminated from his position and replaced with interim head coach Josh Hannay. The club would then go on to lose their next five matches in a row. Cronulla then recovered to sit in eighth place with two games remaining of the regular season. In the final round of the year, Cronulla-Sutherland lost 28–16 against Melbourne and the Gold Coast leapfrogged them into eighth place after they defeated the New Zealand Warriors. Cronulla finished the season in ninth place and missed out on the finals for the first time since 2014.

===2022===
Cronulla surprised many in the 2022 NRL season after finishing second on the table at the end of the regular season. Throughout the year, Cronulla went on a six-game winning run. Halfback Nicho Hynes won the 2022 Dally M Medal with a record 38 votes. In the finals series, Cronulla were defeated 31–30 by North Queensland in the qualifying final which was played at Shark Park. Cronulla had led the match 30–22 with less than ten minutes to go before North Queensland forced the game into extra-time. Former Cronulla player Valentine Holmes kicked the winning field goal for North Queensland. The following week, Cronulla were defeated 38–12 by South Sydney in the semi-final which ended their season.

===2023===
Cronulla started the year strong, pushing into the top 4 at certain stages, before a mid-season slump dropped some of their momentum. They finished the 2023 in sixth place, eventually losing to the Sydney Roosters at Shark Park in an elimination final, 13-12.

===2024===
Cronulla finished the 2024 NRL season in 4th place on the table and qualified for the finals. After losing to Melbourne in week one, Cronulla won their first finals game in over six years as they defeated North Queensland in the elimination semi-final. In the preliminary final against Penrith, Cronulla went into half-time being narrowly behind on the scoreboard. However, in the second half, Penrith would run away with the game winning 26-6 ending Cronulla&#x27;s season.

==Emblem, colours, and song==

=== Logo ===
The club wasn&#x27;t known as the Sharks until after its initial admission into the competition. During Cronulla&#x27;s first season the crest featured a drawing of Captain Cook&#x27;s ship, . It is alleged that during the first season the club President suggested the &#x27;Lions&#x27; while the captain Ken Kearney recommended the &#x27;Sharks&#x27;. The mascot may have been named after the Cronulla Surf Club&#x27;s rugby league teams of the 1970s.
From the late 1970s through to the late 1990s, the Sharks used a predominantly black circular crest with a blue shark. This was changed after Super League in 1997 to a blue and white star-shaped design. Between 1999 and 2002, the name was shortened to simply the &quot;Sharks&quot;. Since 2003, the name has since been changed back to the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and changed their logo again in 2004, which is currently in use.

For Cronulla&#x27;s maiden season in first grade a teal jersey with a white V was adopted from the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club despite Cronulla&#x27;s chocolate and gold design in the Sydney 2nd Division competition. The team colours of black, white and teal changed to sky blue, with grey being incorporated during Super League, and shortly after on the team&#x27;s away strip.

===Primary jerseys===

Cronulla&#x27;s club song is known as &quot;Up Up Cronulla&quot;, and is set to the tune of Beer Barrel Polka (Roll Out The Barrel).

==Stadium==

When the Sharks entered the competition in 1967, they played their home games at Sutherland Oval. They only played there for two seasons with the Sharks winning their first game at the ground on 22 April 1967 NSWRFL season. The record attendance for Sutherland Oval was set in the last Cronulla game played at the ground when 12,578 saw the Sharks go down 32–4 to Canterbury Bankstown, then known as the Berries, now Bulldogs on 16 June 1968 NSWRFL season. Overall, the Sharks compiled a record of 4 wins, 11 losses and 1 draw at the venue.

In 1969, they then moved to Endeavour Field, where they have remained. This home ground has had numerous names over the years including Ronson Field, Shark Park, Toyota Park and until the end of 2012, Toyota Stadium. In 2013, it returned to the original name Endeavour Field. On 4 July 2013, the Cronulla Sharks announced their new stadium naming rights partner Remondis, an international waste solutions and management company.

In 2016 a new sponsorship deal for naming rights was signed with Southern Cross Group to name the stadium Southern Cross Group Stadium. The new partnership with Southern Cross Group (SCGroup) is a three-year deal, reportedly worth $1.5 million.

Southern Cross Group Stadium has a capacity of 22,000 people with the record attendance of 22,302 being set for a game against local rivals the St George Illawarra Dragons on 1 May 2004

==Sharkies Leagues Club==
The Cronulla Sutherland Leagues Club is known as Sharkies, and is located on Captain Cook Drive at Woolooware. The leagues club sits beside the Cronulla Sutherland home ground, Endeavour Field.

Proposals to develop the land assets of the Leagues Club which owns the stadium and land around Endeavour Field stumbled for many years prior to arrival of renowned businessman Damian Irvine. In partnership with his head of finance Craig Douglas the plans finally became more tangible, as details of a residential and shopping centre were released. In August 2012, the club received final approval for their plans solving a 40-year-old problem of financial instability.

The arrival of respected CEO Lyall Gorman has seen 2016 be a watershed year off and on-field for the Sharks.

This rivalry has been dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Beaches&quot;, due to the geographical locations of the two clubs. Manly played the Sharks in two grand finals: 1973 and 1978, which are renowned for being the most brutal in history. Manly won both of these deciders, 10–7 in 1973 and 16–0 in the 1978 replay after the first game ended at 11-all. The Sea Eagles have traditionally had much success over the Sharks, with Cronulla winning at Manly&#x27;s home ground just five times in their history. However the Sharks&#x27; biggest ever win came against Manly, a 68-6 thrashing in 2005. Cronulla and Manly play for the Steve Rogers Trophy when the two clubs meet in the NRL premiership each season. The two teams met in the 2013 finals, when Manly held off Cronulla by 24–18. Most recently the two teams met in the 2019 finals, when Manly beat Cronulla 28–16 at Brookvale Oval.

===St. George Illawarra Dragons===

Cronulla&#x27;s fiercest rivalry is with their Southern Sydney neighbour, St George Illawarra Dragons. The success of the St. George club has often seen Cronulla labelled as the &#x27;little brother&#x27; to the Dragons, further emphasised by the Dragons joint-venture with the Illawarra Steelers in 1998, effectively surrounding the Cronulla-Sutherland region geographically. On ANZAC Day 1999, Cronulla CEO Peter Gow famously cut up a St. George jersey with a pair of scissors in front of onlookers at Cronulla&#x27;s leagues club and assaulted former St. George player Barry Beath who had become involved in the situation. Gow was later sacked by Cronulla for defacing the jersey and for assaulting a club patron.

Despite this the head-to-head match-up between the two clubs is surprisingly even. The two teams always lift the intensity when they meet, which has led to some classic matches over the years. In the 1999 preliminary final, Cronulla-Sutherland had won the minor premiership and looked like cruising to the grand final, before St George Illawarra scored 24 unanswered second half points to win 24–8. They would meet again in the finals in 2002, with Cronulla winning 40–24, and again in 2005 when St George Illawarra won 28–22.
In round 18 of the 2023 NRL season, Cronulla recorded their biggest ever victory over either St. George or St. George Illawarra defeating the latter 52-16.

===Melbourne Storm===
A fairly recent rivalry that reached its height in the 2016 NRL Grand Final which was won by Cronulla.

Round 2 of the 2008 NRL season saw the sides meet at Olympic Park in Melbourne, and Cronulla was able to reverse the result by the same scoreline via a Brett Kimmorley field goal. The match was marred by an ugly brawl which saw Cronulla&#x27;s Ben Ross and Melbourne&#x27;s Brett White sent from the field. It was the only loss Melbourne suffered at home during the 2008 regular season.

The two sides met again in the preliminary final where Melbourne, despite missing captain Cameron Smith to suspension, defeated Cronulla 28–0 to advance to the grand final against Manly-Warringah.

Melbourne began the 2012 NRL season with nine straight victories, before a Paul Gallen-less Sharks pipped them 12-10 thanks to a Jeremy Smith try and clutch conversion from Todd Carney. It looked like Cronulla would land two wins over Melbourne that year, leading 18–10 with 90 seconds to go in the second game between the sides.

Melbourne somehow scored twice to win 20–18. The competitive rivalry between the two sides officially began in late 2015 when Melbourne beat Cronulla 30–2 in spiteful circumstances. Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan accused Melbourne of slowing down the game with their wrestling tackle technique. The loss meant that Melbourne leap-frogged Cronulla into 4th place heading into the finals. Again Cronulla-Sutherland handed Melbourne their first loss of the 2016 NRL season, winning the round 4 clash 14–6. It was the first match in Cronulla&#x27;s record-breaking 15 matches winning streak.

The two sides would meet in the final round of the regular season with the winner taking out the minor premiership. Melbourne won 26-6 and took out the JJ Giltinan Shield. However, Cronulla-Sutherland would win the biggest game ever between the two sides 4 weeks later, winning the 2016 grand final by 14–12 in a thriller.

The two teams traded close wins in 2017, with Cronulla winning 11–2 at AAMI Park before Melbourne returned serve with an 18–13 victory at Southern Cross Group Stadium. 2018 saw Cronulla win both encounters with Melbourne during the regular season, yet despite this, lost to them in the preliminary final 22 to 6.

The match featured a controversial moment when Melbourne player Billy Slater made an illegal tackle on Cronulla winger Sosaia Feki while he was in the act of scoring, therefore constituting a professional foul. Slater managed to avoid the Sin Bin despite being penalised for the action, as well as avoiding suspension, with the NRL judiciary controversially ruling that the tackle did not constitute a shoulder charge. Their round 4 clash in 2018 saw a record 33 penalties blown, and Cameron Smith was sin-binned for the first time in his career.

In the 2021 NRL season, former Melbourne player Will Chambers signed a contract to join Cronulla-Sutherland which closed the chapter of the two sides competitive rivalry. Chambers had previously labelled Cronulla captain Paul Gallen and other Cronulla players as &quot;Drug Cheats&quot; during a 2017 game between the two sides.

<text>Our Dumb Century: The Onion Presents 100 Years of Headlines from America&#x27;s Finest News Source is a satirical humor book written by the staff of &quot;The Onion&quot; and published by Three Rivers Press in 1999. The chief editor of the book was Scott Dikkers, with specific sections edited by Robert D. Siegel, Maria Schneider and John Krewson. It was awarded the 1999 Thurber Prize for American Humor.

The book, spun off from &quot;The Onion&quot; weekly-newspaper format of dryly satirizing current events, features mocked-up newspaper front pages from the entire 20th century, presented as though &quot;The Onion&quot; had been continuously in print since before 1900. The publication of the book is in itself a parody of other end of the century retrospectives that had been published in 1999, notably &quot;Time&quot; magazine and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Summary==
The book satirizes many common beliefs, trends, and perceptions. For instance, in response to the John F. Kennedy assassination theories, one headline declares, &quot;Kennedy Slain By CIA, Mafia, Castro, LBJ, Teamsters, Freemasons&quot; and that he was shot &quot;129 times from 43 different angles.&quot; This is later followed up by an article proclaiming that the &quot;Warren Commission admits to killing JFK.&quot;

The book often takes a cynical look at American foreign policy over the ages, describing past events with revisionist, modern-day perspectives. For example, the Pearl Harbor attacks are described as being an attack on a &quot;colonially-occupied US non-state&quot; and President Woodrow Wilson encourages Americans to fight in World War I in order to &quot;make the world safe for corporate oligarchy.&quot; The article on the 1920 granting of women&#x27;s suffrage states &quot;Women Finally Allowed to Participate in Meaningless Fiction of Democracy.&quot; The article on the beginning of World War II is &quot;WA- (headline continued on page 2),&quot; with &quot;WA-&quot; in especially large print.

Articles on major historical events are often preceded by ironic articles criticizing the irresponsibility that led to such events: For example, an issue dated a week before the 1929 crash of the American stock market heralds the market as &quot;invincible&quot; and urges readers to &quot;put everything they have into the stock market&quot;. In similar fashion, an issue that precedes one announcing the outbreak of World War I shows Archduke Franz Ferdinand (whose assassination sparked the war) declaring that &quot;no man can stop [him]&quot;.

Smaller stories in the book satirize social and pop-cultural trends of their respective eras, such as the faux-advertisements and gimmicks that abound in the top and bottom corners of the pages. For example, from the 1920s: &quot;No, No, Nanette Fever Bonus! Sheet Music from &quot;Tea for Two&quot; Inside&quot;.

Since the book was written before the year 2000, its prediction for that year satirized Y2K and religious prophecies, including &quot;Christian Right Ascends to Heaven,&quot; &quot;All Corporations Merged Into OmniCorp,&quot; and a small graphic listing meteors headed for Earth by size.

==Running gags==
There are a number of running gags through this supposed history of the twentieth century, which are not immediately apparent. One is the existence of a piece of farmyard equipment called &#x27;The Chicken Raper&#x27;. Another is that every major celebrity trial, from Fatty Arbuckle to O.J. Simpson, is referred to as &quot;the trial of the century.&quot; A third is the newspaper fear-mongering by drawing a caricature of America&#x27;s enemy du jour (among them, Spaniards, Nazis, and hippies) sexually assaulting the Statue of Liberty.

Three consecutive pages show a fictionalized end to Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidency which loosely parallels the end of Gary Tison&#x27;s life. First, Nixon is arrested for his connection to the Watergate scandal; the next week&#x27;s headline says he then escaped and is on the run; the third says he was gunned down in a shootout with cops (but Spiro Agnew is still at large).

A more subtle satire is the rise of a (fictional) company called Global Tetrahedron, which first appears as a small business in the first decade of the century and gradually grows into a multinational behemoth. On April 25, 2024, &quot;The Onion&quot; was sold by G/O Media to a newly created firm also named Global Tetrahedron. 

Publisher Emeritus, T. Herman Zweibel, writes frequent editorials, growing more and more erratic until he&#x27;s removed from power by the board of directors in the 1950s.

Article titles from 1905 and from 2000 both read &#x27;Arabs, Jews Forge New Age of Peace.&#x27;

==Cultural references==
Several events from the classic film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; are also used as stories, such as the Bedford Falls High School class drowning in a &quot;jitterbugging accident&quot;, &quot;Mr. Potter To Pay Fifty Cents on the Dollar&quot; during the Great Depression and &quot;Harry Bailey Wins Congressional Medal of Honor&quot; in the World War II section, with Harry S. Truman quoted in the latter story as saying &quot;we owe a great debt to George Bailey for pulling Harry out of the ice when he was 9&quot; and saying George was declared 4-F because of his ear. Eventually, in the 1980s, George Bailey is indicted as part of the Savings and Loan scandal. Also present is the frequent theme of moral outrage at the amount of sex in popular culture, beginning with a depiction of women&#x27;s undergarments reproduced from a Sears catalogue, then extending to jazz music (also thought to have sunk the &quot;Titanic&quot;), Clara Bow appearing sleeveless in a film, and culminating in &quot;Hippies Celebrate Fuck Summer &#x27;67&quot;.

The space race is repeatedly covered, including such articles as &quot;Bleeping Two-Foot Tin Ball Threatens Free World&quot; about the Sputnik launch, &quot;Soviets Ahead in Dog-Killing Race&quot; about the flight of experimental animals, and finally &quot;Holy Shit, Man Walks on Fucking Moon&quot;, a recreation of the Apollo 11 landing, complete with a radio transcript filled with profanity.

==Critical reaction==

The book became a number one &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller shortly after its publication on April 1, 1999.

==Other formats==
An audio version of the book was produced by Scott Dikkers and adapted by Tim Harrod, and was presented as excerpts from the (real-life) nationally syndicated &quot;The Onion Radio News&quot; throughout the same time period and covering many of the same subjects.

<text>Bernard Jeffrey McCullough (October 5, 1957 – August 9, 2008), better known by his stage name Bernie Mac, was an American stand up comedian, actor and film producer. He joined fellow comedians Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer, and D. L. Hughley in the film &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;.

After briefly hosting the HBO show &quot;Midnight Mac&quot;, Mac appeared in several films in smaller roles. His most noted film roles were as Frank Catton in the &quot;Ocean″s&quot; film series from 2001 through 2007 and as the title character of &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;. He was the star of &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, which ran from 2001 through 2006, earning him two Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

Mac&#x27;s other films included starring roles in &quot;The Players Club&quot;, &quot;Head of State&quot;, &quot;Bad Santa&quot;, &quot;Guess Who&quot;, &quot;Pride&quot;, and &quot;Soul Men&quot;. Bernie Mac died at 50 years old on August 9th, 2008 in Chicago, Illinois of complications from pneumonia. Dreamwork&#x27;s Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa is dedicated to his memory.

==Early life and education==
Bernard Jeffrey McCullough was born on October 5, 1957 in Chicago, Illinois. Mac was the second child of Mary McCullough and Jeffrey Harrison. Mac was raised by his single mother and his grandparents on the city&#x27;s south side.

Mac began his high school career at Chicago Vocational High School. During 1973, Mac moved to Tampa, Florida, to attend Jesuit High School following the death of his mother during his sophomore year. Shortly afterward, Mac&#x27;s older brother and his estranged father both died. Mac later returned to Chicago and graduated from Chicago Vocational in 1975.

During his 20s and through his early 30s, Mac worked in a variety of jobs, including janitor, coach, professional mover, cook, bus driver, Wonder Bread delivery man, furniture mover, and UPS agent, while doing comedy on the weekends at clubs and parties.

==Career==

Mac&#x27;s influences were from The Three Stooges and listening to stand-up comedians Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx. Mac started as a stand-up comedian in Chicago&#x27;s Cotton Club. After he won the Miller Lite Comedy Search at the age of 32, his popularity as a comedian began to grow. In 1992, a performance on the 3rd episode of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Def Comedy Jam&quot; thrust him into the spotlight; after Martin Lawrence was unable to calm an increasingly hostile crowd, Mac went onstage and told the audience &quot;I ain&#x27;t scared o&#x27; you mothafuckas&quot; and that he &quot;didn&#x27;t come here for no foolishness.&quot;

=== The Bernie Mac Show ===
In 2001, the Fox network gave Mac his own television sitcom called &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; portraying a fictional version of himself. In the show, he suddenly becomes custodian of his sister&#x27;s three children after she enters rehab. Mac broke the fourth wall to tell his thoughts to the audience.

The show contained many parodies of events in Bernie&#x27;s actual life. Mac, who grew up on Chicago&#x27;s South Side, was a fan of the Chicago White Sox, and would often sneak a reference to his favorite team in episodes, including enlisting then-White Sox pitcher Jon Garland to make a guest cameo appearance. In the 2005 season he wore a White Sox jacket and cap, and congratulated his hometown Chicago White Sox and their staff members on their recent World Series championship.

The show was not renewed after the 2005–2006 season. The series finale aired on April 14, 2006. Among other awards, the show won an Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Writing&quot;, the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting, and the Humanitas Prize for television writing that promotes human dignity. His character on &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; was ranked No. 47 in &quot;TV Guide&quot; list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time&quot;.

During his run on the show, Mac had co-starring roles in the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; trilogy (2001–2007), &quot;Head of State&quot; (2003) and &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003), as well as starring roles in the baseball-themed film &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; (2004) and &quot;Guess Who?&quot; (2005), a remake of the 1967 film &quot;Guess Who&#x27;s Coming to Dinner&quot;.

=== Later years ===
On March 19, 2007, Mac told David Letterman on the CBS &quot;Late Show&quot; that he would retire from his 30-year career after he finished shooting the comedy film, &quot;The Whole Truth, Nothing but the Truth, So Help Me Mac&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m going to still do my producing, my films, but I want to enjoy my life a little bit&quot;, Mac told Letterman. &quot;I missed a lot of things, you know. I was a street performer for two years. I went into clubs in 1977 and was on the road 47 weeks out of the year.&quot;

During this time, Mac was having success as a popular film actor, starting with an appearance in the 2007 film &quot;Transformers&quot; as the car salesman &quot;Bobby Bolivia&quot;, and serving as the voice of Zuba, Alex the Lion&#x27;s long-lost father in &quot;&quot;. He co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson in the 2008 musical comedy &quot;Soul Men&quot;. These last two movies were released months after his death. His final film role was as Jimmy Lunchbox in the 2009 film &quot;Old Dogs&quot; which was released a year after his death.

== Personal life ==
Mac married his high school sweetheart Rhonda Gore on September 17, 1977, and together they had a daughter in 1978.

==Health and death==
In the last 20 years of his life, Mac publicly disclosed that he had severe sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown origin that causes inflammation in tissue. On July 19, 2008, Mac was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in his hometown of Chicago. After being treated in the ICU for three weeks, Mac went into cardiac arrest and subsequently died during the early morning hours on August 9, at the age of 50. However, the complications were not attributed to his sarcoidosis, according to his publicist. &quot;Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa&quot; and &quot;Soul Men&quot; were released posthumously and dedicated to his memory.

==Legacy and tributes==
Mac&#x27;s public memorial was held a week after his death at the House of Hope Church, with nearly 7,000 people in attendance. Notable mourners at Mac&#x27;s funeral were Chris Rock, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Samuel L. Jackson, Ashton Kutcher, Don Cheadle, the cast members from &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;, and his &quot;Kings of Comedy&quot; fellows D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Steve Harvey.

The first two of Mac&#x27;s posthumous films, &quot;Soul Men&quot; and &quot;&quot;, were released three months after his death and were dedicated to him. Mac&#x27;s third posthumously released and final film, &quot;Old Dogs&quot;, was released a year after his death. The 2008 Bud Billiken Parade, which was held in Chicago on the day of Mac&#x27;s death, was also dedicated to his memory. On the day of Mac&#x27;s funeral, his hometown&#x27;s local television station WCIU-TV aired an exclusive television special, &quot;A Tribute to Bernie Mac&quot;, and had interviews with his former colleagues including Camille Winbush, Chris Rock, Joe Torry, Cameron Diaz, Don Cheadle, and some of his family members &amp; close friends.

During Steve Harvey&#x27;s television show which aired November 14, 2016, Harvey read a proclamation from Chicago&#x27;s Mayor Rahm Emanuel proclaiming November 14 as &quot;Bernie Mac Day&quot;. Steve Harvey&#x27;s guests included Bernie&#x27;s wife Rhonda, their daughter Je&#x27;Niece, granddaughter Jasmine, and Bernie&#x27;s &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot; co-stars D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Guy Torry (who was the original host at the beginning of the tour). Mike Epps, appearing via satellite, along with the principal of Bernie and Rhonda&#x27;s alma mater Chicago Vocational High School (CVS), revealed and unveiled the renaming of CVS Auditorium to the &quot;Bernie Mac Auditorium&quot;.

On February 14, 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named Bernie Mac #41 of the 50 Best Stand-Up Comics of All Time.

<text>Robert Alan Frosch (May 22, 1928 – December 30, 2020) was an American scientist who was the fifth administrator of NASA. He was the administrator from 1977 to 1981 during the Carter administration.

==Biography==
Born in New York City, Frosch was educated in the public school system in The Bronx. He earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in theoretical physics at Columbia University.

Between September 1951 and August 1963, Frosch worked as a research scientist and director of research programs for Hudson Laboratories of Columbia University in Dobbs Ferry, New York, an organization under contract to the Office of Naval Research. Until 1953, he worked on problems in underwater sound, sonar, oceanography, marine geology, and marine geophysics. Frosch was first associate and then director of the laboratories, where he managed 300 employees, two ocean-going research vessels, and a $3.5 million annual budget for fundamental research and engineering. During this period he was also technical director of Project Artemis, a very large experimental active sonar system development.

In September 1963, Frosch went to Washington, D.C., to work with the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the U.S. Department of Defense, serving as director for nuclear test detection (Project VELA), and then as deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, sharing responsibility for managing a $270 million per year program of research and development. In July 1966 he became Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research and Development, responsible for all Navy programs of research, development, engineering, test and evaluation averaging $2.5 billion annually. From January 1973 to July 1975, Frosch served as assistant executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program. With the rank of assistant secretary general of the United Nations, he was responsible for substantive global program activities of the United Nations system and other international activities related to environment matters.

While at NASA, Frosch was responsible for overseeing the continuation of the development effort on the Space Shuttle program. During his tenure, the project underwent testing of the first orbiter, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, at NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center in southern California.

He was appointed an International Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1989.

Frosch left NASA with the change of administrations in January 1981 to become vice president for research at the General Motors Research Laboratories. In 1985, he was the recipient of the Maurice Holland Award from the Industrial Research Institute for a paper published in IRI&#x27;s journal, &quot;Research Management&quot;. In 1996, his leadership at GM was recognized once more by IRI with the presentation of their official Medal. After retiring, he remained active in scientific and technical policy activities; as a senior research fellow at the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, and a guest investigator at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.

Frosch died in South Hadley, Massachusetts, on December 30, 2020, at the age of 92, after a long illness.

<doc id="525040" wikidata="Q3100026" url="?curid=525040" title="Geauga Lake">
<text>Geauga Lake was an amusement park in Bainbridge Township and Aurora, Ohio. It was established in 1887, in what had been a local recreation area adjacent to a lake of the same name. The first amusement ride was added in 1889, and the park&#x27;s first roller coaster the Big Dipper was built in 1925. The park was sold to Funtime, Inc., in 1969 and was expanded over the years with additional rides and amenities. Funtime was acquired by Premier Parks in 1995, and for the 2000 season, they re-branded Geauga Lake as Six Flags Ohio, adding four new roller coasters. The following year, Six Flags bought the adjacent SeaWorld Ohio and combined the two parks under the name Six Flags Worlds of Adventure.

The park changed ownership again in 2004 after a purchase by Cedar Fair, and was renamed Geauga Lake once more. The park&#x27;s SeaWorld portion was transformed into a water park in 2005, and together they became known as Geauga Lake and Wildwater Kingdom. On September 21, 2007, less than a week after Geauga Lake closed for the season, Cedar Fair announced that the amusement park would be permanently closed. The water park continued to operate as Wildwater Kingdom through the 2016 season, before being closed as well.

==History==
===Pre-amusement park era===
Geauga Lake was originally known as &quot;Picnic Lake&quot; or &quot;Giles Pond&quot; after early settler Sullivan Giles. Giles built a home in the area in 1817, and later established picnic grounds, a dance hall, and other entertainment, all of which was conveniently located near a train station, which brought in many visitors.

Geauga Lake opened for picnics and swimming in 1872. An 1880 history of Geauga County reported the Giles residence &quot;being easy of access by rail&quot; and a &quot;very popular place of resort during the summer months, for fishing, picnic, and excursion parties.&quot; It also noted that &quot;for the convenience of such parties, Mr. Giles has recently erected a hall of considerable size near the lake. The surrounding grounds are kept clean and attractive, and, without exception, this is the most charming place to spend a leisure day to be found in this section.&quot; At the time, a full-sized steamboat circled the lake, towing a large scow, topped with a dance floor. In 1907, the boat was shipped by rail to Brady Lake near Kent.

===1887–1968: Geauga Lake amusement park===
Geauga Lake park was established in 1887. Three Major League baseball games were played at Geauga Lake in 1888 by the Cleveland Blues of the major league American Association, specifically on Sundays to avoid Cleveland&#x27;s blue laws of the time. In 1889, the park installed its first ride, a steam-powered carousel. More rides would soon follow.

William J. Kuhlman expanded the park in 1925 and added the Big Dipper coaster and the park&#x27;s Olympic-sized swimming pool, the latter of which stayed in operation until the mid-1960s. On July 11, 1926, Olympic medalist and &quot;Tarzan&quot; actor Johnny Weissmuller set a new world record in the 220-yard freestyle swim in the pool in front of 3,000 spectators. Lake swimming also continued throughout the coming decades. A race track was added in 1931. A theater, dance hall, and bowling alley were also added around the same time. The park&#x27;s dance hall and ballroom were major attractions, with live music performed by Guy Lombardo, Fred Waring, Artie Shaw, and other big names of the time. In 1937, the park&#x27;s hand-carved 1926 Marcus Illions carousel was installed at a cost of $35,000, after having been located in Philadelphia and Birmingham.

In 1942, a tornado hit the park, injuring six, destroying multiple buildings, and damaging the Big Dipper. The park reported $50,000 in damages, but it rebuilt. In July 1944, Viola Schryer took over management of the park after the death of her uncle William Kuhlman.

In 1952, a fire destroyed the park&#x27;s bowling alley, theater, dance hall and roller rink, with damages estimated at $500,000. Due to this, the park became strictly a seasonal amusement park, beach, and swimming area. The Olympic-sized swimming pool was closed and razed in the late 1960s, but lake swimming continued. Park admission was free, and park guests paid per ride.

===1969–1999: Funtime era===
In 1969, Funtime Incorporated purchased the park. The park&#x27;s focus continued to be on rides and swimming. The race track closed in 1969. In 1970, a marine life park, SeaWorld Ohio, was built across the lake from the amusement park.

In 1972, the Gold Rush log flume water ride was added, and two years later Geauga Lake added the Skyscraper, which took passengers up 21 stories for views of the park. In 1973, the park converted to an admission charge with a pay-one-price for all the rides and attractions. The Geauga Dog became the park&#x27;s mascot and would remain so until 1999. In 1976, the park added the Wildcat compact steel roller coaster, and a year later the park added the Double Loop, a looping steel coaster.

The Corkscrew coaster made its debut in 1978, making Geauga Lake the first amusement park in Ohio to have two looping coasters. Swimming in the lake continued to be popular at the park, so in 1983, the park added Boardwalk Shores, which featured a paddleboat marina, a new bath house, a children&#x27;s swimming pool area, and water slides. A year later, The Wave, the first tsunami wave pool in the Midwest, opened.

In 1985, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, owner of SeaWorld, announced his intent to purchase Funtime and combine the two parks, but the deal was never completed. In 1986, more children&#x27;s rides were added to a themed area known as Rainbow Island. Stingray water slides and the Euroracer Grand Prix rides were also added.
In 1988, Geauga Lake celebrated its centennial by introducing the Raging Wolf Bobs, a wooden roller coaster with a hybrid twister/out and back design modeled after the original Bobs roller coaster at Chicago&#x27;s defunct Riverview Park. Two years later, the park re-themed the children&#x27;s water area as Turtle Beach, which was advertised as the ultimate children&#x27;s water playground. Geauga Lake expanded its midway with The Mirage and the $2.1 million Texas Twister in the early 1990s.

A corporate deal in 1995 saw Premier Parks acquiring Funtime, giving Geauga Lake a new owner. Premier Parks invested $9 million in new rides, including the Mind Eraser, a steel looping shuttle coaster designed by Vekoma, and Grizzly Run, a water rapids ride designed by Intamin. These attractions opened in 1996, and Corkscrew was closed and sold and moved to Dizzee World in India the same year. The next year, the park expanded its water area by with Hook&#x27;s Lagoon. Several new water slides were also added. Mr. Hyde&#x27;s Nasty Fall, an Intamin first generation freefall ride was also added in 1997.

In 1998, Premier Parks purchased Six Flags from Time Warner. Serial Thriller, an inverted coaster later known as Thunderhawk, was added as well. The next year, Americana, Time Warp, and Skycoaster were added.

===2000–2003: Six Flags era===

In 2000, Geauga Lake received a $40 million expansion and became Six Flags Ohio. As part of that expansion, the park received 20 new rides, including four new roller coasters: a junior coaster called Road Runner Express, a wooden coaster called Villain, a floorless coaster called Batman: Knight Flight and an inverted impulse coaster called Superman: Ultimate Escape. Also added was a new shoot the chute water ride named Shipwreck Falls and a new wave pool in the water park. The old wave pool was filled, and used for a new Looney Tunes themed kids&#x27; area known as Looney Tunes Boomtown.

Around this time, Busch Entertainment determined that its SeaWorld parks should feature roller coasters, water rides, and other attractions to supplement the marine displays and shows, and the company began de-emphasizing the educational aspects of its parks. Due to Six Flags Ohio&#x27;s close proximity to SeaWorld Ohio, Busch approached Six Flags about buying the Six Flags park. Six Flags then made a counter offer to instead buy SeaWorld Ohio. That winter, Six Flags purchased SeaWorld Ohio for $110 million in cash, merging the two complexes into one, and changing the entire complex&#x27;s name to Six Flags Worlds of Adventure. By combining the parks, Six Flags created the largest theme park in the world to date, at 700 acres. The SeaWorld side became known as the &quot;Wild Life&quot; area and remained primarily marine life shows, with a few portable children&#x27;s rides placed throughout. In 2001, the park planned to construct a 200-foot tall coaster on the SeaWorld side of the park, but later abandoned those plans due to height restrictions and other conflicts with the city of Aurora. The original amusement park area became known as the &quot;Wild Rides&quot; area and continued expansion with a Vekoma flying coaster called X-Flight. The original water park area also continued, so the park was marketed as &quot;three parks for one price.&quot; In hopes to expand the water park, the addition of Hurricane Mountain, the then-largest water slide complex in North America, occurred in 2003, and the water park area was later renamed Hurricane Harbor.

===2004–2007: Cedar Fair era===

Facing financial difficulties across its chain, Six Flags considered selling the park. Two months before the 2004 season, a sale to Cedar Fair was announced. The deal was finalized less than a month later for $145 million. The Geauga Lake name was promptly restored to the park. To conform with copyright and trademark laws, all Looney Tunes and DC Comics branding was removed from the park. The Looney Tunes Boomtown kids&#x27; area was renamed Kidworks. The Hurricane Harbor water park area was renamed Hurricane Hannah&#x27;s Waterpark. The marine life portion of the park was closed and demolished, and the animals were relocated to other Six Flags parks, including Six Flags Marine World and Six Flags Great Adventure.

Examples of name changes that took place include:
* Batman: Knight Flight lost the Batman theming and opened in 2004 under the name of Dominator
* Mind Eraser was renamed Head Spin
* Serial Thriller was renamed Thunderhawk
* Superman: Ultimate Escape was renamed Steel Venom
* Road Runner Express was renamed Beaver Land Mine Ride

In 2005, Cedar Fair invested $26 million in Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park on the former SeaWorld site, which resulted in the park&#x27;s name being changed to Geauga Lake &amp; Wildwater Kingdom. The Wildwater Kingdom side had six water slides and a children&#x27;s water play area. The Hurricane Hannah area remained. Mr. Hyde&#x27;s Nasty Fall was closed at the end of 2005. Usable parts were salvaged for Demon Drop, then located at Cedar Point.

In 2006, Wildwater Kingdom was expanded to include Tidal Wave Bay. The Hurricane Hannah area was then shut down. The season was also scaled back, eliminating the spring and fall weekend operations, instead operating strictly between Memorial Day and Labor Day. At the end of the season, X-Flight and Steel Venom were removed. X-Flight was relocated to Kings Island and opened as Firehawk in 2007. Steel Venom was relocated to Dorney Park, where it opened for the 2008 season as Voodoo, and was later renamed Possessed.

===Decline===
Combined attendance at both parks reached an estimated 2.7 million visitors in 2001. By 2004, total park attendance had fallen to approximately 700,000 despite a $40 million investment on rides in 2000. Citing the Cleveland area as their &quot;most difficult market,&quot; Six Flags sold the park to Cedar Fair in March 2004. Speculation that the amusement park side would eventually close began after Cedar Fair relocated two major roller coasters – Steel Venom and X-Flight – to other parks prior to the 2007 season.

===Closing and land redevelopment===

In 2007, the summer-only operation of Geauga Lake continued. The annual Oktoberfest festival weekend held in September every year concluded on September 16, 2007, marking the amusement park&#x27;s last day of operation. On September 21, 2007, Cedar Fair announced that the ride side of Geauga Lake would permanently close, and that the water park side would continue to operate the following season as Geauga Lake&#x27;s Wildwater Kingdom. At the time, the park was still facing financial issues and its attendance levels had declined. Cedar Fair also announced plans to move existing rides to other properties. This led to efforts from locals to save Geauga Lake, especially landmark rides such as the Big Dipper and the Carousel.

Cedar Fair placed the amusement park side&#x27;s land up for sale in 2008. The remaining rides and remnants were auctioned separately on June 17, 2008.

In 2012 and 2013, Cleveland-based photographer and artist Johnny Joo visited Geauga Lake to capture the park in a state of decay. These photos brought heavy local attention from families who had visited the park in its heyday.

As late as January 2013, the amusement park side was still for sale, and projects similar to Crocker Park in Westlake, Ohio were being considered. Bainbridge Township and Cedar Fair hoped to have it resolved by the end of 2013. In March 2013, Cedar Fair announced that they were putting Geauga Lake&#x27;s property up for sale again. Unlike before, they were willing to sell the land in parcels. Several companies showed interest in the land. On September 17, 2017, a plaque was unveiled in memory of the park.

On August 25, 2020, it was announced that PulteGroup, a home construction company, would be building a housing development on the site of the Wildwater Kingdom parking lot. PulteGroup acquired the 245 acre portion of the property for $2 million. The development, known as Renaissance Park at Geauga Lake, included street names like &quot;Carousel Court&quot; and &quot;Dipper Way&quot; to pay tribute to former Geauga Lake attractions. In October 2020, developer Industrial Commercial Properties bought the remaining 377 acres of the property with plans to build homes, restaurants, and retail establishments.

On September 17, 2024, Aurora City Council unanimously voted to purchase 48 acres of land, along with the adjacent lake, from Industrial Commercial Properties. The land was acquired for a total of $5.3 million, including $1.3 million of stimulus money from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The city of Aurora plans to develop this newly-acquired property as a public park, which may include amenities like a beach, pool, and a place for boating. The city council had announced their plans in spring 2023.

== History ==
Archaeological excavations from Kodumanal on the banks of the Noyyal River show traces of civilization from 4th century BCE. Kodumanal is mentioned in &quot;Patiṟṟuppattu&quot; literature from the first century CE as a thriving industrial and commercial center. The evidence indicates that the region was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period (2nd century BCE to 3rd century CE) and it formed part of an ancient Roman trade route. The region came under the influence of the Pandyas during the reign of Arikesari Maravarman in the seventh century CE. Later, the region was ruled by various dynasties such as Rashtrakutas and Western Gangas.

The medieval Cholas conquered the Kongu Nadu in the 10th century CE. While the region was directly under the control of the Imperial Cholas till 1064 CE, the Kongu Cholas who were probably vassals or viceroys of the Cholas, ruled the region autonomously later starting. These rulers bore the title &quot;Konattar&quot; and adopted Chola titles and surnames. In the 13th century CE, after the death of Vikrama Chola II, the Pandyas under Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan I annexed the region. The rule of the Pandyas came to an end with the death of Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in 1318 CE. The Hoysalas ruled the region for sometime later with Vira Someshwara having a matrimonial alliance with both Pandyas and Cholas. After the defeat of Veera Ballala III of the Hoysalas, the region came under the control of the Delhi Sultanate. In the 15th century, Vijayanagara empire defeated the Mughals and established sway over the region.

After the Vijayanagara empire fell in 1646, the region was ruled by various Nayak governors of the erstwhile Vijayanagara empire who declared independence. They introduced the Palayakkarar system under which the region was divided into 24 &quot;Palayams&quot;(towns). In the later part of the 18th century, the region came under the Kingdom of Mysore and after the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East India Company annexed the region to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region played a prominent role in the Second Polygar War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai. Later, the British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857.

<text>The Oslofjord (, ; ) is an inlet in southeastern Norway. The fjord begins at the small village of Bonn in Frogn Municipality and stretching northwards to the city of Oslo, and then curving to the east and then south again. It then flows south to an imaginary line running between the Torbjørnskjær Lighthouse and Færder Lighthouse where it becomes part of the Skagerrak strait. The Skagerrak connects the North Sea and the Kattegat sea area, which leads to the Baltic Sea. The Oslofjord is not a fjord in the geological sense, but in the Norwegian language, the term can refer to a wide range of waterways including inlets such as this one.

The bay is divided into the inner () and outer () Oslofjord, separated by the long by wide Drøbak Sound. The innermost part is known as Bunnefjorden.
==Fjord==
From 1624 until 1925 the name of the fjord was (or ), since Christiania was the name of the capital during this period (the &quot;Ch&quot; was changed to a &quot;K&quot; in 1877). Before that time, the Old Norse name of the fjord was . The old name &quot;Fold&quot; led to the names of the counties of Vestfold (&#x27;the district west of Fold&#x27;) and Østfold (&#x27;the district east of Fold&#x27;) as well as the nearby district of Follo.
==Geography==
Each of the islands in the innermost part of the fjord has its own identity and distinguishing history. Among them are Hovedøya, Lindøya, Nakholmen, Bleikøya, Gressholmen, and Langøyene. These islands can be reached with the Oslo boats from Aker Brygge. Hovedøya is known for containing monastery ruins, Gressholmen for its rabbits, Nakholmen, Bleikøya, Lindøya for their cosy cabins at the water&#x27;s edge, and finally Langøyene for its camping possibilities and beach.

The inner part of the Oslofjord has steep and forest covered hill slopes down towards the fjord.

===Climate===

The Oslofjord has Norway&#x27;s highest all year temperature: . February is the coldest month in the fjord with , while July normally reaches . The islands in the middle of the fjord are among Norway&#x27;s warmest with high summer temperatures and moderate winters. The Oslofjord&#x27;s relatively high temperatures enable various flora to flourish.

==History==
The oldest settlements in the area surrounding the Oslofjord date from the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. It was here on the eastern and western shores that three of the best preserved Viking ships were unearthed, including the Gokstad ship. In historical times, this bay was known by the current name of the region, Viken ().

Oslofjord has been an important body of water strategically due to its proximity to the capital city of Oslo. During World War II, there were German installations at several points on its coastline. One installation in Hovedøya held 1,100 Wehrmacht soldiers and later women deemed Nazi collaborators at the National Internment Camp for Women in Hovedøya.

Norwegian painter Edvard Munch had a cottage and studio in Åsgårdstrand on the fjord and the Oslofjord appears in several of his paintings, including &quot;The Scream&quot; and &quot;Girls on the Pier&quot;.

===Second World War===
The fjord was the scene of a key event in the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the Battle of Drøbak Sound. The invasion plan envisaged landing of 1,000 troops transported by ship to Oslo. Colonel Eriksen, Commander of the Oscarsborg fortress near Drøbak, mainly maintained for historical purposes, sank the German heavy cruiser &quot;Blücher&quot; in the Drøbak narrows.

The fortress&#x27;s resistance blocked the route to Oslo, thus delaying the rest of the invading group long enough for the Norwegian royal family, government, parliament, and national treasury to evacuate. Thus Norway never surrendered to the Germans, leaving the Quisling government illegitimate and permitting Norway to participate as an ally in the war, rather than as a conquered nation.
==Demographics==
The entire population situated around the Oslofjord including Oslo is about 1.96 million, and the total population of all the counties situated around the fjord is approximately 2.2 million.

More than 40% of Norway&#x27;s population resides under 45 minutes of driving from the Oslofjord. The Oslofjord has Norway&#x27;s busiest traffic of ferries and cargo boats.

Although the Oslofjord contains hundreds of populated islands, most of the population of the fjord resides on the mainland.

==Recreation==
In the summer there are boats of all sizes on the fjord, and it is possible to go kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and sailing.

The Oslofjord is one of the nine venues of the Class 1 World Powerboat Championship.

<text>A phone-sync (also known as a tape-sync, a simul-rec, or a double-ender) was a technique used to conduct televised interviews over long distances in the 1980s before satellite television became commonplace, in order to provide video to what would otherwise be an audio-only interview. It was commonplace in such news programs as &quot;The Journal&quot; on CBC Television.

A standard Tape sync works as follows: an interviewer, usually in a television studio, is videotaped conducting an interview via a long-distance phone call to the interviewee in another part of the world. This interviewee, often in a studio in front of a background representing the city in which he or she is located, is videotaped as he or she participates in the interview. The two videotapes are then sent to the interviewer&#x27;s production team to be synchronized through video editing. Cuts between shots of the interviewer and interviewee are made accordingly, and the higher-quality sound of the videotapes are used instead of the telephone audio. For effect, the interviewer may be taped looking into a bluescreen or greenscreen, into which the video of the interviewee would at this point be resized if necessary and inserted using chroma key.

The double-ender technique has become much less commonplace with the proliferation of live satellite television feeds and video over Internet (Skype, etc.), but is still used today when such technology is not available.

The double-ender technique can also be done with audio-only mediums, such as radio or podcasting. Syndicated radio show interviews are often done as a double-ender, with the host in their studio, and the guests recording in their own city, in the studio of their local affiliate.

Double-ender audio interviews have become more common with the rise in popularity of podcasting. The result is a cast that sounds like the hosts and guests are in the same room, when they&#x27;re actually in different cities.

<doc id="525059" wikidata="Q845964" url="?curid=525059" title="Long-billed corella">
<text>The long-billed corella, also known as long-billed cockatoo or slender-billed corella (Cacatua tenuirostris), is a cockatoo native to Australia, which is similar in appearance to the little corella. This species is mostly white, with a reddish-pink face and forehead, and has a long, pale beak, which is used to dig for roots and seeds. It has reddish-pink feathers on the breast and belly.

==Taxonomy==
The long-billed corella does not have any recognized subspecies. The first formal written description was by German naturalist Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. It is one of several related species of cockatoos called corellas and classified in the subgenus &quot;Licmetis&quot; within the genus &quot;Cacatua&quot;, members of which are known as &quot;white cockatoos&quot;.

== Description ==
The adult long-billed corella measures from 38 to 41 cm in length, has a wingspan around 80–90 cm, and averages 567 g in weight. It has a long, bone-coloured beak, and a rim of featherless, bluish skin around the eyes. The plumage is predominantly white with reddish feathers around the eyes and lores. The underside of the wings and tail feathers are tinged with yellow.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The long-billed corella can be found in the wild in Victoria and southeastern New South Wales. It has extended its range since the 1970s into Melbourne, Victoria and can now be found in Tasmania, South Australia and southeast Queensland. A feral population resides in Perth, Western Australia as of the mid-1980s, which has conservation implications as this species may hybridize with the endangered western corella. 

The long-billed corella is found in grassy woodlands and grasslands, including pasture, fields of agricultural crop, and urban parks.

== Ecology and behaviour ==

=== Call ===
The call of the long-billed corella is a quick, quavering, falsetto &quot;!&quot;, &#x27;, or &#x27; combined with harsh screeches.

=== Breeding ===
Breeding generally takes place in Austral winter to spring (from July to November). Long-billed corellas form monogamous pairs and both sexes share the task of building the nest, incubating the eggs, and caring for the young. Nests are made in decayed debris, the hollows of large old eucalypts, and occasionally in the cavities of loose gravely cliffs. 2–3 dull white, oval eggs are laid on a lining of decayed wood. The incubation period is around 24 days and chicks spend about 56 days in the nest.

=== Feeding ===

The long-billed corella typically digs for roots, seeds, corms, and bulbs, especially from the weed onion grass. Native plants eaten include murnong &quot;Microseris lanceolata&quot;, but a substantial portion of the bird&#x27;s diet now includes introduced plants. 

==Relationship with humans==

=== As pets ===

Long-billed corellas are now popular as pets in many parts of Australia, although they were formerly uncommon, and their captive population has stabilised in the last decade. This may be due to their ability to mimic words and whole sentences to near perfection. The long-billed corella has been labeled the best &quot;talker&quot; of the Australian cockatoos, and possibly of all native Psittacines.

=== As pests ===
Long-billed corellas are viewed as agricultural pests, particularly in western Victoria and Western Australia. They can cause significant crop damage, are known for tearing and playing with pieces of asphalt along roadsides, and even damaging power lines. Permits are regularly issued in Western Australia (and sometimes in Victoria) for the culling of this species. Within New South Wales, the corellas are the most common avian pest among sporting fields and golf courses, as they can dig holes in the ground up to 3 in across and 6 in deep.

In July 2019, in a scene that was said to resemble a &quot;horror movie&quot;, about 60 corellas in Adelaide, South Australia, died in a suspected case of poisoning after &quot;falling from the sky&quot; wailing and bleeding from their mouths. At least 57 (95%) of the 60 birds were long-billed corellas, with a few short-billed corellas. It was hoped that whoever poisoned them could be traced, after toxicology tests were performed (which could nevertheless take several weeks to complete); in Australia, people are required to register if they purchase poisons, according to Sarah King (founder of Casper&#x27;s Bird Rescue, who witnessed the deaths). King also said that the poison was a slow-release variety that takes several painful weeks to kill the bird. Additionally, the local Alexandrina council had, previously, allowed for periodic culling of short-billed corellas due to crop damage, chewing on streetlights and wires, damaging infrastructure (such as buildings and sporting equipment), and unfairly outcompeting other native species of birds, insects, small mammals, and other organisms.

<text>Markeaton is a suburban village and former civil parish within Derby in the ceremonial county of Derbyshire, England. It is in the Mackworth Ward of Derby City Council.

The village lies on the narrow Markeaton Lane road. It is home to the popular Markeaton Park.
==History==
The name is derived from Old English &quot;Mearca&#x27;s Farm&quot;. The spelling was Marcheton in 1086.

After the Norman conquest the manor of Markeaton, which had been held by the Anglo-Saxon Siward, the Fairbairn Earl of Northumbria, was given to Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, along with Chevinetum, Mackworth and Allestree.

It passed to John, Earl of Huntingdon and Cambridge who died in 1237, his only heirs being his sisters. To prevent the estate passing to women, it was bought by the Crown in 1246. It was held by various members of the royal family, including the Black Prince until his death in 1376 when it returned to the Crown.

In the early 14th century the Mundy family purchased land. Sir John Mundy was Lord Mayor of the City of London in 1522.
The village land was enclosed by the Mundys during the 18th century, forcing many of the villagers to move their homes outside the enclosed land.

== Civil parish ==
Markeaton was formerly a township in the parish of Mackworth. From 1866 Markeaton was a civil parish in its own right, but on 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Allestree, Darley Abbey, Derby and Mackworth. In 1931 the parish had a population of 307.

==Markeaton Hall==
A grand house, Markeaton Hall, was built in a traditional half timbered style; this was replaced by a new hall during the late 18th century.

In 1929, the Markeaton Hall and twenty acres (81,000 m2) of its gardens were given to the Corporation of Derby by the Reverend Clarke Maxwell who had inherited the estate from the late Mrs Mundy, on condition that the whole area would be used as a public park and that the mansion would be maintained for cultural purposes: for example as a museum or an art gallery. The hall was used by the Army during World War II and allowed to fall into disrepair after the war.

The council had continually neglected the building, and it was eventually declared to be unsafe. The council decided to demolish it, leaving only the Orangery and stable yards.

==The Church==
Markeaton shares its church with the nearby village of Mackworth. This 13th-century church was fortified, one of the rare examples of such a church, to protect the villagers and their farm stock from raids by the Meynells, who lived at Langley Meynell.

<text>The Jožef Stefan Institute (JSI) () is the largest research institute in Slovenia. The main research areas are physics, chemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, information technologies, reactor physics, energy and environment. At the beginning of 2013 the institute had 962 employees, of whom 404 were PhD scientists.

The mission of the Jožef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology for the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence.

==History==
The institute was founded by the State Security Administration (Yugoslavia) in 1949 for atomic weapons research. Initially, the Vinča Nuclear Institute in Belgrade was established in 1948, followed by the Ruđer Bošković Institute in Zagreb in 1950 and the Jožef Stefan Institute as an Institute for Physics in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is named after the distinguished 19th century physicist Josef Stefan (), best known for his work on the Stefan–Boltzmann law of black-body radiation.

IJS is involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of Slovenia.

Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the University of Nova Gorica, the Jožef Stefan International Postgraduate School and the Ljubljana Technology park.

<text>Playa Kalki is a beach on the Caribbean island of Curaçao, also known as Alice in Wonderland due to mushroom-shaped coral formations. The name &quot;Kalki&quot; is unrelated to the Avatar Kalki, but comes from the local Papiamentu word for the white coral rock and limestone, which is abundant on the beach and surrounding cliffs.

Playa Kalki and its surroundings are known for their good scuba diving conditions. Several reefs on and around Playa Kalki offer good dive sites for beginners and professionals. There is a professional dive center located directly on the beach at Playa Kalki.

<text>Mz 3 (Menzel 3) is a young bipolar planetary nebula (PN) in the constellation Norma that is composed of a bright core and four distinct high-velocity outflows that have been named lobes, columns, rays, and chakram. These nebulosities are described as: two spherical bipolar lobes, two outer large filamentary hour-glass shaped columns, two cone shaped rays, and a planar radially expanding, elliptically shaped chakram.
Mz 3 is a complex system composed of three nested pairs of bipolar lobes and an equatorial ellipse.
Its lobes all share the same axis of symmetry but each have very different morphologies and opening angles.
It is an unusual PN in that it is believed, by some researchers, to contain a symbiotic binary at its center.
One study suggests that the dense nebular gas at its center may have originated from a source different from that of its extended lobes. The working model to explain this hypothesizes that this PN is composed of a giant companion that caused a central dense gas region to form, and a white dwarf that provides ionizing photons for the PN.

Mz 3 is often referred to as the Ant Nebula because it resembles the head and thorax of a garden-variety ant.

==Characteristics==
Mz 3 is radially expanding at a rate of about 50 km/s and has its polar axis oriented at an angle of around 30° from the plane of the sky (Lopez &amp; Meaburn 1983; Meaburn &amp; Walsh 1985). It is sometimes compared to the more extensively studied Butterfly Nebula (M 2-9), and it is quite likely that both have a similar evolutionary history. They both have point-like bright nuclei, are narrow-waisted bipolar nebulae, and share surprisingly similar spatially dependent spectra. Because of their similarity, their differences are noteworthy. Their greatest difference is probably in their near infrared emissions. Mz 3 has no trace of molecular hydrogen emission, whereas the M 2-9 has prominent H2 emission lines in the near-IR. The lack of H2 emissions from Mz 3 is unusual given the strong correlation between such emissions and bipolar structures of PN. Additionally, the polar lobes of Mz 3 are more mottled and rounded as compared to M 2-9. Finally, Mz 3 is not known to evidence temporal variability in its polar lobes as is found in M 2-9 (Doyle et al. 2000). 

The Herschel Space Observatory has detected laser light emissions from the nebula -- specifically, hydrogen recombination line laser emissions. This confirms the presence of a white dwarf with a binary companion at the heart of the nebula.

===Chakram===
Of the morphological features of Mz 3, one of the most unusual and odd is the chakram (first noticed in 2004), a faint, large, limb brightened ellipse that appears to have its center on the PN&#x27;s nucleus. While the plane of the ellipse is near the other feature&#x27;s shared reflection symmetry plane, it is definitely offset. This structure&#x27;s kinematics are the only such ones known among studied PN. Unlike all the other Mz 3 structures, there is no increase of velocity as the radial offset from the nucleus increases. Consequently, this must not be a simple equatorial flow despite the fact that its motion appears to be strictly radial (that is, there is no indication of rotation which would suggest that this feature is dynamically stable). All the kinematic properties of the ellipse are symmetric and very ordered relative to the nucleus, consistent with all the other Mz 3 features. Therefore, the ellipse must be historically linked to the evolution of the central star. 

The Ant Nebula is 8,000 light years away from Earth and it has a magnitude of 13.8.

==History==
Mz 3 was discovered by Donald Howard Menzel in 1922. 

It was studied on July 20, 1997 by astronomers (University of Washington) and (Leiden University) on observations done with the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope was later used on June 30, 1998 by Raghvendra Sahai and John Trauger of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to picture the PN.

<doc id="525071" wikidata="Q1060624" url="?curid=525071" title="Batting helmet">
<text>A batting helmet is worn by batters in the game of baseball or softball. It is meant to protect the batter&#x27;s head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is &quot;hit by pitch,&quot; due to an inadvertent wild pitch or by intent, may be seriously, even fatally, injured.

==Early concepts (1905–1920s)==
In 1905, Mogridge created the first crude protective headgear and was granted patent No. 780899 for a &quot;head protector.&quot; This first attempt at a batting helmet was said to look like an &quot;inflatable boxing glove that wrapped around the hitters head.&quot; Roger Bresnahan, Hall of Fame catcher who was injured after being struck in the head with a pitch, developed a leather batting helmet in 1908 which he began using. The helmets were not so much helmets as they were protective earmuffs. They did not protect the actual head of the batter but rather protected the ear and temple region. He also developed an aluminum protector for the back of the head that was covered in fake hair, but it is not known if it was ever used in the field.

In 1908, Chicago White Sox shortstop Freddy Parent wore a head protector of some sort and Chicago Cubs&#x27; first baseman-manager Frank Chance did the same thing in 1913, though Chance&#x27;s headgear was &quot;little more than a sponge wrapped in a bandage.&quot; In 1914, minor leaguer Joe Bosk, playing for the Utica Utes, wore a protector after being severely injured when he was struck in the head by a pitch in 1911.

Despite the fatal beaning of Ray Chapman in 1920, protective headgear was still used only rarely in the major leagues. That year, a syndicated news article claimed several baseball executives—including New York Giants secretary Frank McQuade—were trying to mandate the use of batting helmets. The article also asserted helmets were unpopular among players. The first known case of a manager issuing head protectors to his players on a large scale was Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; manager Pat Moran who gave cork-cushioned hats to his players in 1921. Connie Mack, manager of the Philadelphia Athletics, voiced his support for protective headgear in 1921.

==Revived interest (1930s–1950s)==

In 1936, Willie Wells, a Negro leagues player, was knocked unconscious with a pitch to the temple. Disregarding the doctor&#x27;s advice, Wells wore a modified construction hard hat as protective gear in a game the next day.

After Mickey Cochrane, a Hall of Fame catcher for the Detroit Tigers, suffered a career-ending and near-fatal skull fracture on May 25, 1937, on a pitch by New York Yankees&#x27; pitcher Bump Hadley, there was a strong call for batter helmets. Cochrane himself went on record saying that players should &quot;absolutely&quot; be required to wear protective helmets.

Only one week after Cochrane&#x27;s injury, on June 1, 1937, the Cleveland Indians and Philadelphia Athletics became the first teams to test helmets, using leather and polo helmets respectively. Managers of both teams decided to use batting practice as a test run for helmet use on their players, before a game between the two teams. Though there is picture evidence of the polo helmets being worn in batting practice, there is no evidence of their being used or worn in a game. The first documented team to wear helmets in a game was the Des Moines Demons of the Western League. They also used polo helmets but the idea did not stick, as they only wore the helmets for one game.

The first professional baseball league to fully adopt the baseball helmet was the International League, which did so in 1939 when the list of official equipment used began to include a &quot;safety cap or helmet&quot;. Buster Mills was the first player in the league to use a helmet.

The idea of making helmets a required part of Major League Baseball was discussed by officials of the National League in a meeting at the 1940 MLB All-Star Game in Chicago. Ford Frick, president of the National League, showed the helmet he designed with the hopes that the league would adopt it. Frick told the Associated Press, &quot;[A batting helmet] is the only way I know that we can prevent head injuries and the only way we can make the players wear them is make it a league rule.&quot; Though the National League at this meeting did not adopt it, Jackie Hayes became the first player to wear the helmet in a game on August 22, 1940.
In 1941, the National League adopted the use of a helmet, designed by George Bennett, a Johns Hopkins University brain surgeon, for use by all teams in spring training. On March 8, 1941, the Brooklyn Dodgers announced that the team&#x27;s players would be wearing the helmets during regular season games. On April 26, 1941, the Washington Senators joined the Dodgers as the only two teams to fully adopt the batting helmet for regular season use. The New York Giants on June 6 and the Chicago Cubs on June 24 also joined the list of teams to fully adopt the use of protective helmets during games.

Though many thought this would be the time when support would be strong enough to develop widespread usage, again tradition won out, and it was not until 1953 that the Pittsburgh Pirates mandated their players wear helmets. The helmet required by Pittsburgh general manager Branch Rickey (formerly the Dodgers general manager and president) was created by Charlie Muse and was based on the hard hats used by miners. Soon after, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; wrote that &quot;Major League clubs are becoming quite interested in a new type of plastic protective cap which has been put on the market recently.&quot; This became even more prevalent when on August 1, 1954, Joe Adcock, a first baseman for the Milwaukee Braves, was struck with a pitch on his head. He was wearing a helmet and, though he was taken off the field on a stretcher, he was uninjured as his helmet took the brunt of the impact and was visibly dented.

In the early 1950s, the governing body of Little League Baseball mandated the use of protective headgear during games for all players. In 1956 the National League followed suit and required the use of batting helmets by all players on all teams. After Little League Baseball announced a better helmet for the use of all players, the American League passed a rule on March 1, 1958, requiring all players to wear helmets. However, unlike in the National Hockey League (NHL) of the same era, helmets were widely accepted. It was not until December 1970 that Major League Baseball enforced strictly mandatory use of the batting helmet for all batters. Veteran players, however, were allowed to choose to wear a helmet or not, as they were grandfathered into the rule. The last Major League player to bat helmetless was Bob Montgomery, who last played for Boston Red Sox in 1979, coincidentally the same year the NHL finally made helmets compulsory with a similar grandfather clause for veteran players.

==Modifications (1960–2000)==

In 1960, Jim Lemon became the first player to wear the new Little League helmet in a Major League game. These helmets were made with earflaps on both sides and were capable of withstanding a ball traveling at up to . One month later, Jimmy Piersall became the second player to wear the helmet in the Major Leagues.

With the helmet being worn league wide in Major League Baseball, alterations began in 1961.

On July 23, 1961, catcher Earl Battey was hit in the face with a pitch, fracturing a bone, and 10 days later returned to the field with a makeshift earflap to protect the injured area, though he only wore it for one game because he complained of difficulty seeing while wearing it. Tony Oliva also wore a makeshift face protector during batting practice, as did the Twins&#x27; Jimmie Hall in the 1965 World Series.

In 1964, the Phillies&#x27; Tony González was the first to wear a batting helmet with a pre-molded earflap. Prior to this, earflaps had been improvised. González was in the league top-ten in hit by pitches and the special helmet was constructed for his use. Shortly after this, Major League Baseball adopted the use of a helmet with a pre-molded earflap.

Ron Santo was also an early pioneer of wearing earflap helmets at the major league level, upon returning to action after having his left cheekbone fractured by a pitch in 1966. Although helmets with earflaps were common at the amateur levels in baseball, they were slow to gain popularity at the professional level. Some batters felt that seeing the earflap out of the corner of an eye was distracting. Tony Conigliaro was wearing a helmet without an earflap when he was seriously injured by a pitch in August 1967.

During the 1970 season, Brooks Robinson began using a batting helmet with an ear flap. He found the helmet&#x27;s brim in addition to the earflap limited his visibility so he took a hacksaw and removed most of the brim. Robinson would wear the modified helmet for the remainder of his career.

Robert Crow was a plastic and reconstructive surgeon working for the Atlanta Braves in the 1970s when he invented a device that could protect players who were coming back from facial injuries. He called it a &quot;C-Flap&quot; after his last name and what it protected — the cheek. The device could be attached to the ear flap of the standard helmet to offer the added protection. The device did not become mainstream until decades later and in the meantime, players tried various things for the same purpose. For example, in 1978, the Pirates Dave Parker wore a hockey mask at the plate after he broke his cheek and jaw bones in a collision at home plate. This lasted only one game and Parker then tried to use a helmet with an attached two-bar football facemask. He also tried a helmet with another football facemask, the Dungard 210 facemask, screwed into his helmet. 

Other notable players to utilize non-C-flap modified batting helmet include Gary Roenicke (1979), Ellis Valentine (1980), Charlie Hayes (1994), and Otis Nixon (1998). The first known player to wear the C-flap was Oakland A&#x27;s catcher Terry Steinbach after breaking an orbital bone due to a freak pregame accident in May 1988. Steinbach had facial surgery and returned to action about a month later wearing a C-Flap. Other players would follow C-flap utilization, including David Justice, Kevin Seitzer, Mike Devereaux, Marlon Byrd, Chase Headley, and Jason Heyward. Heyward was the first player to begin wearing the C-flap permanently (2013) after enduring a facial injury, and Yadier Molina (2016) was the first player to begin permanently wearing the C-flap to prevent a facial injury where he had not previously had one.

In 1979, after taking a pitch to the face that required 25 stitches, Baltimore Orioles player Gary Roenicke wore a modified helmet with the facemask of a football helmet attached. According to Roenicke, the Orioles trainers took the face mask from the helmet of Baltimore Colts quarterback Bert Jones and affixed to the batting helmet. Roenicke wore the modified helmet until 1981.

In 1983, it was made mandatory for new players to use a helmet with at least one earflap. Players who were grandfathered in could choose to wear a helmet without ear flaps, if they so desired. Players can choose to wear double earflap helmets in the major leagues; however, this is not mandatory. Tim Raines was the last player to wear a helmet without earflaps, during the 2002 season. His flap-less Florida Marlins helmet is currently at the Baseball Hall of Fame. Gary Gaetti, who retired in the year 2000, plus Ozzie Smith and Tim Wallach, who both retired in 1996, also wore flapless helmets until they retired. Julio Franco, who retired from baseball in May 2008, was the last active player eligible to wear a helmet without flaps, but he chose to wear a helmet with an earflap throughout his career. Some players, mostly switch hitters, also decide to wear double earflap helmets while batting. Players to do this include Willie McGee, Terry Pendleton, Vince Coleman, Mark Bellhorn, Shane Victorino, Orlando Hudson, and Jed Lowrie (all of which are switch hitters).

==Recent developments (2000–present)==

On April 8, 2004, celebrated as &quot;Hank Aaron Day&quot; in Atlanta because it is the 30th anniversary of Hank Aaron&#x27;s record-breaking 715th home run, Braves shortstop Rafael Furcal came to the plate in the sixth inning with a helmet without an earflap, as a tribute to Hank Aaron, who played his entire career in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and therefore did not wear a helmet with an earflap during his playing career. Umpire Bill Welke made him get one with a flap.

In 2005, Major League Baseball tested a new batting helmet for the first time in nearly three decades. At the All-Star Game in Detroit, players were seen wearing a new &quot;molded crown&quot; helmet that featured side vents, back vents and larger ear holes. The majority of players now wear these new helmets but some including Ryan Howard stayed with the older style.

The no-flap helmet is still utilized in baseball. Catchers often wear a flapless helmet along with a facemask to protect the head when receiving pitches. Occasionally, players other than catchers will wear a batting helmet without earflaps while playing a defensive position in the field. This is usually done by a player who has a higher-than-normal risk of head injury. One example is former major-league player John Olerud, who started doing so after undergoing emergency surgery for a cerebral aneurysm while attending Washington State University. An earlier example was Richie Allen, who decided to wear a helmet in the field after at least one incident of being hit by objects thrown by fans. Umpires across Major League Baseball have opted to wear a flapless helmet under their traditional face mask instead of switching to the hockey-style mask worn by a few other umpires. Such practice began when umpires Mike Estabrook and John Tumpane opted to use a black helmet with their face mask while they were behind the plate.

Major League bat-boys/bat-girls and ball boys/ball girls are required to wear a helmet rather than a cap while performing their duties while on the field of play. They are allowed to use the no-flap helmet for this purpose, and many do.

Following the 2007 death of Tulsa Drillers first base coach Mike Coolbaugh after being hit by a batted ball, there has been debate as to whether base coaches should wear helmets. Following the incident, the Oakland Athletics&#x27; Rene Lachemann decided to wear a helmet out to his third base coaching position.

After the 2007 season, Major League Baseball made it mandatory for coaches to wear helmets beginning with the 2008 season, although some coaches, such as the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; Larry Bowa, have disagreed with the decision.

In 2009, Major League Baseball decided to take action and protect players from the increasing number of concussions and head injuries. Rawlings came out with the S100 baseball helmet, named for its impact capabilities. It was able to withstand the impact of a baseball traveling at from away. The other baseball helmets used are only required to withstand a impact from away. The first Major League Player to wear this helmet during a game was Canadian-born Ryan Dempster, a pitcher with the Chicago Cubs. The new helmet did not catch on because the players said it made them look like bobbleheads. Some players, including Mets third baseman David Wright, did decide to use the helmet while batting.

In 2013, per the new MLB-MLBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, MLB players were required to wear the new Rawlings S100 Pro Comp.

In 2018, several Major League Baseball players including Mike Trout and Bryce Harper began wearing the C-flap, an attachment to the earflap covering the jaw, invented by Markwort. The C-flap has caught on quickly throughout Major League Baseball and now batting helmet manufacturers such as Rawlings and Easton have begun producing helmets with a built-in earflap extension emulating the C-flap.

On May 28, 2018, Philadelphia Phillies slugger Rhys Hoskins fractured his jaw when he fouled a ball off his own face against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hoskins, 25, was given a choice: miss four to six weeks or return after 10 days on the disabled list with a C-Flap on both sides for complete armament. Hoskins opted to return early with the double-C-Flap look, and just 12 days later, Hoskins made his return from the disabled list.

Currently, all leagues up to and including Minor League Baseball require the use of a double earflap batting helmet, with certain state amateur leagues being one exception (e.g., South Dakota Amateur Baseball Association). In Major League Baseball, however, only one earflap is required (for the ear closest to the pitcher).

<text>The bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is a species of sheep native to North America. It is named for its large horns. A pair of horns may weigh up to ; the sheep typically weigh up to . Recent genetic testing indicates three distinct subspecies of &quot;Ovis canadensis&quot;, one of which is endangered: &quot;O. c. sierrae&quot;. 

Sheep originally crossed to North America over the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia; the population in North America peaked in the millions, and the bighorn sheep entered into the mythology of Native Americans. By 1900, the population had crashed to several thousand due to diseases introduced through European livestock and overhunting.

==Taxonomy and genetics==
&quot;Ovis canadensis&quot; is one of two species of mountain sheep in North America; the other species being &quot;O. dalli&quot;, the Dall sheep. Wild sheep crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia into Alaska during the Pleistocene (about 750,000 years ago); subsequently, they spread through western North America as far south as Baja California and northwestern mainland Mexico. Divergence from their closest Asian ancestor (snow sheep) occurred about 600,000 years ago. In North America, wild sheep diverged into two extant species — Dall sheep, which occupy Alaska and northwestern Canada, and bighorn sheep, which range from southwestern Canada to Mexico. However, the status of these species is questionable given that hybridization has occurred between them in their recent evolutionary history.

===Former subspecies===
In 1940, Ian McTaggart-Cowan split the species into seven subspecies, with the first three being mountain bighorns and the last four being desert bighorns:
* Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, &quot;O. c. canadensis&quot;, found from British Columbia to Arizona.
*Badlands bighorn sheep (or Audubon&#x27;s bighorn sheep), &quot;O. c. auduboni&quot;, occurred in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Nebraska. This subspecies has been extinct since 1925.
* California bighorn sheep, &quot;O. c. californiana&quot;, found from British Columbia south to California and east to North Dakota. The definition of this subspecies has been updated (see below).
* Desert bighorn sheep, &quot;O. c. nelsoni&quot;, the most common desert bighorn sheep, ranges from California through Arizona and in west Texas as the result of conservation and re-introduction efforts.
* Mexican bighorn sheep, &quot;O. c. mexicana&quot;, ranges from Arizona and New Mexico south to Sonora and Chihuahua.
* Peninsular bighorn sheep &quot;O. c. cremnobates&quot;, occur in the Peninsular Ranges of California and Baja California
* Weems&#x27; bighorn sheep, &quot;O. c. weemsi&quot;, found in southern Baja California.

===Current subspecies===

Starting in 1993, Ramey and colleagues, using DNA testing, have shown this division into seven subspecies is largely illusory. Most scientists currently recognize three subspecies of bighorn. This taxonomy is supported by the most extensive genetics (microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA) study to date (2016) which found high divergence between Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, and that these two subspecies both diverged from desert bighorn before or during the Illinoian glaciation (about 315–94 thousand years ago). Thus, the three subspecies of &quot;O. canadensis&quot; are:
* Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (&quot;O. c. canadensis&quot;) – occupying the U.S. and Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the Northwestern United States.
* Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (&quot;O. c. sierrae&quot;) – formerly California bighorn sheep, a genetically distinct subspecies that only occurs in the Sierra Nevada in California. However, historic observer records suggest that bighorn sheep may have ranged as far west as the California Coastal Ranges, which are contiguous to the Sierra Nevada via the Transverse Ranges. An account of &quot;wild sheep&quot; in the vicinity of the Mission San Antonio near Jolon, California and the mountains around San Francisco Bay dates to circa 1769.
* Desert bighorn sheep (&quot;O. c. nelsoni&quot;) – occurring throughout the desert regions of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. The 2016 genetics study suggested a more modest divergence of this desert bighorn sheep into three lineages consistent with the earlier work of Cowan: Nelson&#x27;s (&quot;O. c. nelsoni&quot;), Mexican (&quot;O. c. mexicana&quot;), and Peninsular (&quot;O. c. cremnobates&quot;). These three lineages occupy desert biomes that vary significantly in climate, suggesting exposure to different selection regimens.

In addition, two populations are currently considered endangered by the United States government:
* Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (&quot;O. c. sierrae&quot;),
* Peninsular bighorn sheep, a distinct population segment of desert bighorn sheep (&quot;O. c. nelsoni&quot;)

==Description==

Bighorn sheep are named for the large, curved horns borne by the rams (males). Ewes (females) also have horns, but they are shorter and straighter. They range in color from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a white rump and lining on the backs of all four legs. Males typically weigh , are tall at the shoulder, and long from the nose to the tail. Females are typically , tall, and long. Male bighorn sheep have large horn cores, enlarged cornual and frontal sinuses, and internal bony septa. These adaptations serve to protect the brain by absorbing the impact of clashes. Bighorn sheep have preorbital glands on the anterior corner of each eye, inguinal glands in the groin, and pedal glands on each foot. Secretions from these glands may support dominance behaviors.

Bighorns from the Rocky Mountains are relatively large, with males that occasionally exceed and females that exceed . In contrast, Sierra Nevada bighorn males weigh up to only and females to . Males&#x27; horns can weigh up to , as much as all the bones in the male&#x27;s body.

==Natural history==

===Ecology===

The Rocky Mountain and Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep occupy the cooler mountainous regions of Canada and the United States. In contrast, the desert bighorn sheep subspecies are indigenous to the hot desert ecosystems of the Southwestern United States and Mexico. Bighorn sheep inhabit alpine meadows, grassy mountain slopes, and foothill country near rugged, rocky cliffs and bluffs. Since bighorn sheep cannot move through deep snow, they prefer drier slopes, where the annual snowfall is less than about per year. A bighorn&#x27;s winter range usually has lower elevations than its summer range.

Bighorn sheep are highly susceptible to certain diseases carried by domestic sheep, such as psoroptic scabies and pneumonia; additional mortality occurs as a result of accidents involving rock falls or falling off cliffs (a hazard of living in steep, rugged terrain). Bighorns are well adapted to climbing steep terrain, where they seek cover from predators. Predation primarily occurs with lambs, which are hunted by coyotes, bobcats, gray foxes, wolverines, jaguars, ocelots, lynxes, and golden eagles.

Bighorn sheep of all ages are threatened by black bears, grizzly bears, wolves, and especially mountain lions, which are perhaps best equipped with the agility to prey on them in uneven, rocky habitats. Fire suppression techniques may limit visibility through shrublands, and therefore increase cover and predation rates by mountain lions. Bighorn sheep are considered good indicators of land health because the species is sensitive to many human-induced environmental problems. In addition to their aesthetic value, bighorn sheep are considered desirable game animals by hunters.

Bighorn sheep graze on grasses and browse shrubs, particularly in fall and winter, and seek minerals at natural salt licks. Females tend to forage and walk, possibly to avoid predators and protect lambs, while males tend to eat and then rest and ruminate, which lends to more effective digestion and greater increase in body size.

===Social structure and reproduction===

Bighorn sheep live in large herds and do not typically follow a single leader ram, unlike the mouflon, the ancestor of the domestic sheep, which has a strict dominance hierarchy. Before the mating season or &quot;rut&quot;, the rams attempt to establish a dominance hierarchy to determine access to ewes for mating. During the prerut period, most of the characteristic horn clashing occurs between rams, although this behavior may occur to a limited extent throughout the year. Bighorn sheep exhibit agonistic behavior: two competitors walk away from each other and then turn to face each other before jumping and lunging into headbutts. Rams&#x27; horns can frequently exhibit damage from repeated clashes. Females exhibit a stable, nonlinear hierarchy that correlates with age. Females may fight for high social status when they are integrated into the hierarchy at one to two years of age.

Rocky Mountain bighorn rams employ at least three different courting strategies. The most common and successful is the tending strategy, in which a ram follows and defends an estrous ewe. Tending takes considerable strength and vigilance, and ewes are most receptive to tending males, presumably feeling they are the most fit. Another tactic is coursing, when rams fight for an already tended ewe. Ewes typically avoid coursing males, so the strategy is ineffective. The rams also employ a blocking strategy. They prevent a ewe from accessing tending areas before she even enters estrus.

Bighorn ewes have a six-month gestation. In temperate climates, the peak of the rut occurs in November, with one, or rarely two, lambs being born in May. Most births occur in the first two weeks of the lambing period. Pregnant ewes of the Rocky Mountains migrate to alpine areas in spring, presumably to give birth in areas safer from predation, but are away from areas with good quality forage. Lambs born earlier in the season are more likely to survive than lambs born later. Lambs born late may not have access to sufficient milk, as their mothers are lactating at a time when food quality is lower. Newborn lambs weigh from and can walk within hours. The lambs are then weaned when they reach four to six months old. The lifespan of ewes is typically 10–14 years and 9–12 years for rams.

===Infectious disease===
Many bighorn sheep populations in the United States experience regular outbreaks of infectious pneumonia, which likely result from the introduction of bacterial pathogens (in particular, &quot;Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae&quot;, and some strains of &quot;Mannheimia haemolytica&quot;) carried asymptomatically in domestic sheep. Once introduced, pathogens can transmit rapidly through a bighorn population, resulting in all-age die-offs that sometimes kill up to 90% of the population. In the years following pathogen introduction, bighorn populations frequently experience multiple years of lamb pneumonia outbreaks. These outbreaks can severely limit recruitment and likely play a powerful role in slowing population growth.

==Relationship with humans==
===Conservation===
Bighorn sheep were widespread throughout the western United States, Canada, and northern Mexico two hundred years ago. The population was estimated to be 150,000 to 200,000. Unregulated hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing of rangelands, and diseases contracted from domestic livestock all contributed to the decline, the most drastic occurring from about 1870 through 1950.

In 1936, the Arizona Boy Scouts mounted a statewide campaign to save the bighorn sheep. The scouts first became interested in the sheep through the efforts of Major Frederick Russell Burnham. Burnham observed that fewer than 150 of these sheep still lived in the Arizona mountains. The National Wildlife Federation, the Izaak Walton League, and the National Audubon Society also joined the effort. On January 18, 1939, over of land were set aside to create the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge and the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge.

Many state and federal agencies have actively pursued the restoration of bighorn sheep since the 1940s. However, these efforts have met with limited success, and most of the historical range of bighorns remains unoccupied. Hunting for male bighorn sheep is allowed, but heavily regulated, in Canada and the United States.

=== In culture ===

Bighorn sheep were among the most admired animals of the Apsaalooka (Crow) people, and what is today called the Bighorn Mountain Range was central to the Apsaalooka tribal lands. In the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area book, storyteller Old Coyote describes a legend related to the bighorn sheep. A man possessed by evil spirits attempts to kill his heir by pushing the young man over a cliff, but the victim is saved by getting caught in trees. Rescued by bighorn sheep, the man takes the name of their leader, Big Metal. The other sheep grant him power, wisdom, sharp eyes, sure-footedness, keen ears, great strength, and a strong heart. Big Metal returns to his people with the message that the Apsaalooka people will survive only so long as the river winding out of the mountains is known as the Bighorn River.

Bighorn sheep are hunted for their meat and horns, used in ceremonies, as food, and as hunting trophies. They also serve as a source of ecotourism, as tourists come to see the bighorn sheep in their native habitat.

The Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep is the provincial mammal of Alberta and the state animal of Colorado and, as such, is incorporated into the symbol for the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife. The Desert bighorn sheep is the state mammal of Nevada.

The Bighorn sheep was featured in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Buford the Little Bighorn&quot; (1967) by Bill Peet. The Bighorn sheep named Buford has a huge pair of horns in the Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, similar to &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;.

Bighorn sheep were once known by the scientific identification &quot;argali&quot; or &quot;argalia&quot; due to assumption that they were the same animal as the Asiatic argali (&quot;Ovis ammon&quot;). Lewis and Clark recorded numerous sightings of &quot;O. canadensis&quot; in the journals of their exploration—sometimes using the name argalia. In addition, they recorded the use of bighorn sheep horns by the Shoshone in making composite bows. William Clark&#x27;s Track Map produced after the expedition in 1814 indicated a tributary of the Yellowstone River named Argalia Creek and a tributary of the Missouri River named Argalia River, both in what is today Montana. Neither of these tributaries retained these names, however. The Bighorn River, another tributary of the Yellowstone, and its tributary stream, the Little Bighorn River, were both indicated on Clark&#x27;s map and did retain their names, the latter being the namesake of the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

The Bighorn Ram was featured in a series of prints by artist Andy Warhol. In 1983, the artist was commissioned to create a portfolio of ten endangered species to raise environmental awareness. The portfolio, known as &quot;Endangered Species&quot; was created in support of the Endangered Species Act, which was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1973. Other animals within the portfolio include the Siberian Tiger, Bald Eagle and the Giant Panda.

<text>Conor Mullen Oberst (born February 15, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his work in Bright Eyes. He has also played in several other bands, including Desaparecidos, the Faint (previously named Norman Bailer), Commander Venus, Park Ave., Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, Monsters of Folk, and Better Oblivion Community Center. Oberst was named the Best Songwriter of 2008 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

==Early life and education==
Conor Mullen Oberst was born on February 15, 1980, the youngest of three boys, and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, to Matthew Ryan Oberst Sr., an information manager for Mutual of Omaha, and Nancy Oberst, an elementary education director for Omaha Public Schools. Oberst had two older brothers, Matthew Ryan Oberst Jr. and Justin H. Oberst. Matthew was a teacher and part-time musician until his death in 2016, and helped finance one of Oberst&#x27;s self-released independent albums. Matt was also in the indie band Sorry About Dresden, which Conor played in from time to time. Conor has been writing and releasing music from a very young age, releasing his first solo album when he was 13.

Oberst was educated at St. Pius X/St. Leo School in Omaha, Nebraska, where he was in the school choir and other musical groups, and Creighton Preparatory School, also in Omaha, Nebraska. He briefly was enrolled at the University of Nebraska and dropped out after three semesters to tour.

==Career==

===Early career===
One night in 1992, Ted Stevens (of Mayday and Cursive) invited Oberst onstage to play. Bill Hoover, who was in attendance, invited Oberst to come back to play with him a couple of weeks later. In that short amount of time, Oberst wrote enough songs to fill out the set, establishing himself as an artist. Shortly thereafter, Oberst began committing his new repertoire to tape in his parents&#x27; basement with his father&#x27;s four track cassette recorder and an acoustic guitar.

In mid-1993, Oberst self-released his debut album &quot;Water&quot; on cassette tape. The release of the album was financed by his brother Justin on what they called Lumberjack Records, the indie label that would become Saddle Creek Records, making them founders and present day executives of the label.

Shortly after his two solo recordings, Oberst began playing with four friends; they formed Commander Venus in mid-1995.

&quot;Here&#x27;s to Special Treatment&quot; was followed by 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Soundtrack to My Movie&quot;, a cassette only released on Sing Eunuchs!. &quot;Kill the Monster Before It Eats Baby&quot;, a split 7-inch vinyl with Bill Hoover, was also released around this time.

===The Faint (1994–1995)===
In 1994, following a Slowdown Virginia show, Oberst, along with Joel Petersen and brothers Todd Fink and Clark Baechle, formed a band called Norman Bailer, later known as The Faint.

A few days later, Oberst told the other members of the band that they had a show in two weeks at Kilgore&#x27;s. Despite having never performed together, they produced nine songs to perform. An album, &quot;Sine Sierra&quot;, was released (on cassette only) in 1995.

===Commander Venus (1994–1998)===

Oberst formed the rock band Commander Venus in 1994 with Tim Kasher, Ben Armstrong, and Robb Nansel. They recorded two albums: &quot;Do You Feel at Home?&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Uneventful Vacation&quot; (1997). Kasher later went on to form Cursive and Nansel was the co-founder of Saddle Creek Records. Kasher left the group to focus on Cursive as they were about to go into the studio to record their second album, and was replaced by Todd Baechle. Commander Venus disbanded in 1998.

===The Magnetas (1996)===
The Magnetas were only active for a very brief period of time in 1996 in Omaha. Along with Oberst, band members included Todd Fink (the Faint) and Chris Hughes (Beep Beep). They recorded three songs, only one of which (&quot;Annex Anex&quot;) was released on Ghostmeat Records &quot;Parts&quot; compilation album. Two other confirmed recordings exist: &quot;Clatter&quot; and &quot;Science Fiction in Schools&quot;.

===Park Ave. (1996)===

In January 1996, Oberst began playing drums in a group named Park Ave., alongside Clark Baechle, Jenn Bernard, Neely Jenkins (now in the band Tilly and the Wall), and Jamie Williams (also in Tilly and the Wall). The group only played between 10 and 15 shows and made a handful of recordings (several of them with Mike Mogis as producer). The group disbanded in 1998 when Williams, the singer and primary songwriter, moved to London, England. In 1999, Urinine Records released their only album, &quot;When Jamie Went to London ... We Broke Up&quot;, which has also now been re-released under Team Love.

===Bright Eyes (1995–2011, 2020–present)===

Oberst founded Bright Eyes as a solo project in 1995, and after the disbanding of Commander Venus, released &quot;A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995–1997&quot; in January 1998. This was followed quickly by &quot;Letting Off the Happiness&quot;, released in November of the same year. It featured members of numerous bands and was recorded in the Oberst family basement. One year later, Bright Eyes released its first EP, &quot;Every Day and Every Night&quot;. Bright Eyes&#x27; third album, &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot; was released in May 2000; it was ranked 170 on Pitchfork&#x27;s list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.

With the release of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground&quot;, Bright Eyes received national attention and Oberst was proclaimed a breakthrough artist by several notable magazines. On January 25, 2005, Bright Eyes simultaneously released two new albums: the folk &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; and more electronic-pop &quot;Digital Ash in a Digital Urn&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; listed &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot; as one of the top ten albums of 2005.

The &quot;Four Winds&quot; EP was released in March 2007, followed by their seventh album, &quot;Cassadaga&quot; in April. The song &quot;Four Winds&quot; was named a top 100 song of 2007 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Oberst spent the next two years focusing on other music projects, and in June 2009 told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; he wanted to make one final album with Bright Eyes before retiring the group. The band subsequently released &quot;The People&#x27;s Key&quot; on Conor&#x27;s 31st birthday, February 15, 2011.

In January 2020 the band announced their return to both touring and recording after a nine-year hiatus, and released their tenth album &quot;Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was&quot; on August 21, 2020.

===Desaparecidos (2001–2002, 2010, 2012–2015)===

Oberst is a guitarist and singer for Desaparecidos. The music and lyrics of Desaparecidos differ greatly from Bright Eyes, having more in common with punk rock than Oberst&#x27;s usual folk rock. The lyrics are generally social commentary on the state of affairs in America and the pitfalls of the suburban lifestyle, as opposed to the more introspective lyrics of Bright Eyes. Desaparecidos was active as a band between 2001–2002, they re-grouped for several one off shows in the Omaha area during the early 2010&#x27;s before reuniting fully between 2012–2015. Their debut album &quot;Read Music / Speak Spanish&quot;, was released on February 12, 2002. A second full length album &quot;Payola&quot;, was released on June 23, 2015. 

===Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band (2007–2012)===

In November 2007, it was reported that Oberst would work on a solo record with Jake Bellows, and that he and M. Ward would start a band and perform two late December shows in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Contrary to what was believed, the shows were not played with M. Ward, but rather with Nik Freitas and Jason Boesel. They also played a show in February in Mexico City, Mexico.

On March 31, 2008, it was announced that Conor Oberst would play at the 2008 Reading and Leeds Festivals. He also performed at the Electric Picnic, in County Laois, Ireland, on August 31, 2008, the Cains Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; in late September 2008, shows across Australia in early October 2008, and the Warfield Theater in San Francisco October 24. Oberst also headlined the Friday night slot of the End of the Road Festival at the Larmer Tree Gardens in Wiltshire, held over the weekend of September 12–14, 2008.

Conor Oberst released the self-titled album &quot;Conor Oberst&quot;, which was recorded in Tepoztlán, Morelos, Mexico, with Taylor Hollingsworth on guitar and Macey Taylor on bass, on August 5, 2008, on Merge Records.

In about mid-October, the band sold a new EP, &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Pact&quot;. It was limited to 1000 copies and was only available on tour. The band placed limitations on how many were sold at shows. It has four unreleased tracks. Three of them are pre-album songs while &quot;Corina, Corina&quot; is a cover of a traditional folk song.

Oberst and the band released their second album, &quot;Outer South&quot;, on May 5, 2009, on Merge Records. They have also released a documentary, &quot;One of My Kind&quot;, following the band from Conor&#x27;s solo album to their most recent album &quot;One of My Kind&quot;.

===Monsters of Folk (2009)===

Conor Oberst is one of the four members of the band Monsters of Folk. Other band members include Jim James of My Morning Jacket, M. Ward and fellow Bright Eyes member Mike Mogis. The band members swap instruments and share vocal duties. The quartet released their self-titled debut album on September 22, 2009.

===Solo work (2008–present)===
Oberst released his first solo album, Water, in the form of a cassette tape when he was just 13. However, this album is difficult to find and is no longer sold.
His second solo album was 2008&#x27;s self-titled &quot;Conor Oberst&quot;. Throughout the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, Oberst embarked on a solo tour of North America and Europe performing with Ben Brodin on guitar and vibraphone. On the tour, he played songs from Bright Eyes, Mystic Valley Band, and Monsters of Folk as well as playing new songs.

Oberst released a new solo record, titled &quot;Upside Down Mountain&quot;, on May 19, 2014. He has been working with producer Jonathan Wilson (Dawes, Father John Misty) and Swedish duo First Aid Kit.

On October 14, 2016, Oberst released his seventh studio solo record, titled &quot;Ruminations&quot;, on Nonesuch Records.

On January 18, 2017, Oberst announced a companion album to &quot;Ruminations&quot;, called &quot;Salutations&quot;.

===Better Oblivion Community Center (2019)===
Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers revealed their oft rumored new band, Better Oblivion Community Center, on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert on January 23, 2019, and released their eponymous debut album at midnight on January 24, 2019 (out via Dead Oceans). Band members include guitarist Nick Zinner from Yeah Yeah Yeahs and drummer Carla Azar from Autolux.

==Other projects==
===Saddle Creek records===
Oberst is one of the founding members of the independent record label Saddle Creek Records, an integral part of Omaha&#x27;s indie rock scene, which hosts bands such as Cursive, Desaparecidos, The Faint (which left to start its own label Blank.wav), Rilo Kiley (which left to start its own label Brute-Beaute Records), Bright Eyes, Two Gallants, Son, Ambulance, Azure Ray, The Good Life, Sorry About Dresden, and Big Thief among others.

===Team Love records===
Oberst co-founded the Team Love record label (along with Nate Krenkel, longtime manager of Bright Eyes) to &quot;do different things, or smaller things, that we couldn&#x27;t get everyone to be into at the same time&quot; at Saddle Creek. such as Tilly and the Wall, Willy Mason, The Felice Brothers, David Dondero, Taylor Hollingsworth and Jenny Lewis&#x27; solo album with The Watson Twins.

===Pageturners Lounge===
Oberst opened Pageturners Lounge, a bar, with Philip Schaffart in 2012. Pageturners Lounge is located in the Dundee neighborhood in Omaha. The business name is a holdover from the bookstore that formerly occupied the space.

== Music style and influences ==
Oberst was drawn to music at a very early age, due in part to his brother Matt&#x27;s penchant for bands like The Smiths, R.E.M., Fugazi, and The Cure. He has cited The Cure&#x27;s first singles collection, &quot;Staring at the Sea&quot;, as the first record he ever bought, as well as being one of his favorites. &quot;It must have been third grade ... I bought the cassette at a local record store chain called Homer&#x27;s in Omaha. I just loved the sound of Robert Smith&#x27;s voice. It just sounded good.&quot;

Some of his biggest influences and favorite songwriters are local musicians David Dondero and Simon Joyner. Joyner wrote the song &quot;Burn Rubber&quot;, which Bright Eyes covered on the &quot;Take It Easy (Love Nothing)&quot; single. The two used to do mini-tours together, usually on weekends due to Joyner having a family.

Oberst has also been heavily influenced by the 1960s folk revival, mentioning Neil Young, Leonard Cohen, and country singers Emmylou Harris, John Prine and Townes Van Zandt. Harris sang on a few tracks on Bright Eyes&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m Wide Awake, It&#x27;s Morning&quot;. As a prolific and well-known musician in the folk genre, he has sometimes been defined as &quot;a new Bob Dylan.&quot; He covered Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Out on the Weekend&quot;, collaborating with Mike Mogis, Jim James and M. Ward in concert. He performed the Townes Van Zandt song &quot;Rex&#x27;s Blues&quot; live with fellow musician Steve Earle. He has also performed two of John Prine&#x27;s songs live, &quot;Crazy as a Loon&quot; and &quot;Wedding Day in Funerville&quot;.

Oberst was greatly influenced by Daniel Johnston, whose &quot;Devil Town&quot; was covered and featured on &quot;Noise Floor&quot;, and profoundly influenced by Elliott Smith, stating in an October 22, 2003 &quot;All Things Considered&quot; interview that, &quot;sometimes when you&#x27;re not feeling good, you have to listen to really sad music like Elliott Smith&#x27;s&quot; and that [Smith] &quot;wrote the sweetest, saddest, most gentle songs&quot;. Oberst also said he liked to &quot;listen to Elliott Smith&#x27;s songs when he [couldn&#x27;t] find anyone to talk to on the phone&quot; and thought that it was sad that &quot;through his music, [Smith] had the ability to answer feelings in others that he was unable to answer in himself&quot;. A live cover of Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Biggest Lie&quot; is featured on &quot;Motion Sickness&quot;. Oberst also has described the late singer-songwriter Vic Chestnutt as “one of the greatest ever,” and Bright Eyes released a cover of Chestnutt’s song “Flirted with You All My Life” in 2021.

==Personal life==
In the 2000s, Oberst was in a relationship with singer-songwriter Maria Taylor for seven years.

In 2010, Oberst married Corina Figueroa Escamilla, whom he met in 2008 while recording music in Mexico. They separated amicably in 2017.

In December 2013, Oberst was accused of sexual assault by a female fan, leading to widespread media coverage. However, by July 2014, she had retracted the accusation, stating that the accusations were &quot;100% false&quot; and that &quot;my actions were wrong and could undermine the claims of actual sexual assault victims, and for that I also apologize&quot;. Of the period in his life, Oberst said &quot;I&#x27;m not violent towards anyone ... And for a second, to have the whole world think that [the allegations were] true about me just did a number on my psyche.&quot; He also went on to emphasize that he did not want to minimize how frequently women are sexually assaulted and said that &quot;as painful and surreal and fucked up as my situation was, I don&#x27;t ever want to use this as an example to justify anything.&quot;

Oberst&#x27;s brother Matthew died suddenly on November 27, 2016, in Cary, North Carolina, where he was a schoolteacher. He was 42.

===Health===
On October 28, 2015, in the midst of Desaparecidos&#x27; tour for their second studio album &quot;Payola&quot;, it was announced that Oberst had been hospitalized due to &quot;laryngitis, anxiety, and exhaustion,&quot; according to a press release. The entirety of Desaparecidos&#x27; remaining tour dates were cancelled and Oberst returned to his hometown of Omaha to recuperate.

In September 2024, Oberst lost his voice after Bright Eyes completed three warm-up shows in preparation for their tour in support of &quot;Five Dice, All Threes&quot;. The band cancelled its next three shows &quot;to prioritise rest and recuperation for the remainder of the month&quot;. On September 27, Bright Eyes cancelled all of their 2024 tour dates following medical tests which determined Oberst &quot;developed a condition that is exacerbated by excessive singing, requiring both treatment and recuperation&quot;. The band&#x27;s second show, in Cleveland, sparked concern from fans after Oberst appeared to be heavily intoxicated and, while slurring his words, expressed frustration with his strained voice and subsequently joked about killing himself. On October 23, Oberst posted a video message in which he thanked fans for their messages of support and reported &quot;feeling a lot better&quot;.

<doc id="525081" wikidata="Q1107889" url="?curid=525081" title="Desert bighorn sheep">
<text>The desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) is a subspecies of bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis&quot;) that is native to the deserts of the United States&#x27; intermountain west and southwestern regions, as well as northwestern Mexico. The Bureau of Land Management considered the subspecies &quot;sensitive&quot; to extinction.

The trinomial of this species commemorates the American naturalist Edward William Nelson (1855–1934). The characteristics and behavior of the desert bighorn sheep generally follow those of other bighorn sheep, except for adaptation to the lack of water in the desert. They can go for extended periods of time without drinking water.

The desert bighorn sheep is the state mammal of Nevada. It is also the mascot of the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California.

==Distribution==
The range of the desert bighorn sheep includes habitats in the Mojave Desert, Sonoran Desert, Great Basin Desert, and Chihuahuan Desert, as well as the Colorado Plateau. Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, Joshua Tree National Park, Death Valley National Park, Kofa National Wildlife Refuge, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Zion National Park, Capitol Reef, and Mojave National Preserve all offer protected habitat for them. The subspecies is considered extirpated from Oregon.

Populations of the desert bighorn sheep declined drastically with European colonization of the American Southwest beginning in the 16th century. These declines were followed by a period of population stabilization ascribed to conservation measures. As of 2004, desert bighorn sheep numbers remained extremely low, although the overall population trend had increased since 1960.

==Characteristics==
Desert bighorn sheep are stocky, heavy-bodied sheep, similar in size to mule deer. Weights of mature rams range from 115 to 280 pounds (52 to 127 kg), while ewes are somewhat smaller. Due to their unique concave elastic hooves, bighorn are able to climb the steep, rocky terrain of the desert mountains with speed and agility. They rely on their keen eyesight to detect potential predators, such as mountain lions, coyotes, and bobcats, and they use their climbing ability to escape.

Both sexes develop horns soon after birth, with horn growth continuing more or less throughout life. Older rams have curling horns measuring over three feet long with more than one foot of circumference at the base. The ewes&#x27; horns are much smaller and lighter and do not tend to curl. After eight years of growth, the horns of an adult ram may weigh more than 30 pounds. Annual growth rings indicate the animal&#x27;s age. The rams may rub their own horns to improve their field of view. Both rams and ewes use their horns as tools to break open cactus, which they consume, and for fighting.

Desert bighorn sheep typically live for 10–20 years. The typical diet of a desert bighorn sheep is mainly grasses. When grasses are unavailable, they turn to other food sources, such as sedges, forbs, or cacti.

===Desert adaptations===
The desert bighorn has become well adapted to living in the desert heat and cold and, unlike most mammals, their body temperature can safely fluctuate several degrees. During the heat of the day, they often rest in the shade of trees and caves.

Southern desert bighorn sheep are adapted to a desert mountain environment with little or no permanent water. Some may go without visiting water for weeks or months, sustaining their body moisture from food and from rainwater collected in temporary rock pools. They may have the ability to lose up to 30% of their body weight and still survive. After drinking water, they quickly recover from their dehydrated condition. Wildlife ecologists are just beginning to study the importance of this adaptive strategy, which has allowed small bands of desert bighorns to survive in areas too dry for many of their predators.

===Social life===

Desert bighorn sheep are social, forming herds of eight to 10 individuals; sometimes herds of 100 are observed.

Rams battle to determine the dominant animal, which then gains possession of the ewes. Facing each other, rams charge head-on from distances of or more, crashing their massive horns together with tremendous impact, until one or the other ceases.

Desert bighorn sheep live in separate ram and ewe bands most of the year. They gather during the breeding season (usually July–October), but breeding may occur anytime in the desert due to suitable climatic conditions. Gestation lasts 150–180 days, and the lambs are usually born in late winter.

==Conservation status and trends==
The number of desert bighorn sheep in North America in prehistoric times is unknown, but most likely was in the tens of thousands. By the 1960s, the desert bighorn population had dwindled to 6,700-8,100. These declines were attributed to excessive hunting; competition and diseases from domestic livestock, particularly domestic sheep; usurpation of watering areas and critical range by human activities; and human-induced habitat changes.

In 1939, after intense lobbying by Frederick Russell Burnham and the Arizona Boy Scouts, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation to establish two desert areas in southwestern Arizona to help preserve the desert bighorn sheep: Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge. In 1941, the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico was added.

Desert bighorn sheep populations have trended upward since the 1960s. The upward trend was caused by conservation measures, including habitat preservation. In 1978, desert bighorn sheep populations were estimated at 8,415-9,040. A state-by-state survey published in 1985 estimated the overall US desert bighorn sheep population at 15,980. The 1993 estimate of the population is 18,965-19,040.

In Southwestern Utah, desert bighorns were largely extirpated by 1960, until 14 sheep were re-introduced into Zion National Park in 1978. The southeastern corner of the park is closed to all human traffic to protect their habitat. The herd has now grown to over 500 animals, to the point that they often come in contact with visitors in the eastern part of the park, and may begin spreading into surrounding agriculture areas with domesticated sheep.

In southern California, by 1998, only 280 individuals of the peninsular bighorn sheep population remained, and that population was added to the list of the United States&#x27; most imperiled species. Populations in three southern counties had suffered greatly from disease, development, and predation. As of 2008, about 800 peninsular bighorns are believed to populate the desert backcountry from the US-Mexico border to the San Jacinto Mountains, with known populations in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. These gains, combined with Bush administration policies, prompted the US Fish and Wildlife Service to propose a reduction in protected sheep habitat by more than 50%, from .

In southern Texas, desert bighorn sheep conservation began in 1973 with the release of seven captive-bred sheep in the Sierra Diablo Mountains. Captive-bred sheep were periodically released in this area until 1997. The Elephant Mountain Wildlife Management Area herd began with 20 sheep total in 1987. The Elephant Mountain population has increased substantially, and this population has been the source for most translocation efforts in the state so far. The Sierra Vieja population started in 1987 with 5 sheep, and from 2014 to 2015, an additional 76 sheep were released, half of them fitted with radio telemetry collars to understand their movements more. The Van Horn population came from wild-caught Nevada sheep in 1987. This population did not do so well due to predation from mountain lions. The Culberson County population was also started in 1988 from wild-caught sheep from Nevada. 
The Black Gap Wildlife Management Area population translocation began in 1995 with 20 sheep. Over the next five years, 73 more sheep would be released with origins from Nevada and Elephant Mountain. Restoration efforts picked up again in 2018 with the release of 82 sheep from Elephant Mountain. Most of those sheep were fitted with radio telemetry collars to track population factors. 
A very limited number of hunting permits are awarded per year in Texas, with one public land permit being donated to a conservation organization for auction purposes. Most of these funds go back to the conservation of the bighorn sheep. In 2020, three Texas Parks and Wildlife Department employees died in a helicopter accident working on desert bighorn sheep conservation.

On December 4, 2024, 77 desert bighorn sheep were successfully transported from the Elephant Mountain WMA and released at Franklin Mountains State Park, including many pregnant ewes. Prior to release, all animals were fitted with GPS collars, tagged, and tested negative for the &quot;Mycoplasma ovipneumonia&quot; bacteria.

== In popular culture ==
In 2023 the desert bighorn was featured on a United States Postal Service Forever stamp as part of the &quot;Endangered Species&quot; set, based on a photograph from Joel Sartore&#x27;s &quot;Photo Ark&quot;. The stamp was dedicated at a ceremony at the National Grasslands Visitor Center in Wall, South Dakota.

<text>The [[University of Southern California]] School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) houses eight academic divisions: Film &amp; Television Production; Cinema &amp; Media Studies; John C. Hench Division of Animation + Digital Arts; John Wells Division of Writing for Screen &amp; Television; Interactive Media &amp; Games; Media Arts + Practice; Peter Stark Producing Program and the Expanded Animation Research + Practice Program. 

The USC School of Cinematic Arts is led by dean Elizabeth Monk Daley, who holds the Steven J. Ross/Time Warner Chair and is the longest-serving dean at the University of Southern California, having led the cinema school since 1991.

==History==
When Douglas Fairbanks became the first president of the nascent Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1927, one of his recommendations was that the academy should have a “training school”. As Fairbanks and his enablers reasoned that training in the cinematic arts should be seen as a legitimate academic discipline at major universities, given the same degree considerations as fields like medicine and law. Although cinema studies programs are now widely entrenched in academia, back then it was a novel idea and many universities turned Fairbanks down. But he found tepid acceptance at the University of Southern California that agreed to allow one class, called “Introduction to Photoplay” that debuted in 1929, the same year as the Academy Awards. Determined to make it a success, Fairbanks brought in the biggest industry names of the era to lecture, including Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, William C. DeMille, Ernst Lubitsch, Irving Thalberg, and Darryl Zanuck. From that one class grew a Department of Cinematography (1932) in the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, renamed the Department of Cinema (1940), which led to the establishment of the USC School of Cinema-Television (1983), which was renamed the USC School of Cinematic Arts (2006).

On September 19, 2006, USC announced that alumnus George Lucas had donated US$175 million to expand the film school with a new facility. This represented the largest single donation to USC and the largest to any film school in the world. His previous donations resulted in the naming of two buildings in the school&#x27;s previous complex, opened in 1984, after him and his then-wife Marcia, though Lucas was not fond of the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture used in those buildings. An architectural hobbyist, Lucas laid out the original designs for the project, inspired by the Mediterranean Revival Style that was used in older campus buildings as well as the Los Angeles area. The project also received another $50 million in contributions from Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company.

In fall 2006, the school, together with the Royal Film Commission of Jordan, created the Red Sea Institute of Cinematic Arts (RSICA) in Aqaba, Jordan. The first classes were held in 2008, and the first graduating class for the university was in 2010.

The USC School of Cinematic Arts announced it would remove an exhibit devoted to actor and former USC student John Wayne, after months of insistence from a small number of students denouncing the Hollywood star’s views and the portrayal of indigenous Americans in his films. The exhibit has been relocated to the Cinematic Arts library which has many collections for the study of figures whose lives and works are part of society&#x27;s shared history. These materials are preserved for posterity and made accessible for research and scholarship as will the materials in the Wayne Collection.

<text>Samuel Dold Morgan (November 8, 1798 – June 10, 1880), was an American businessman, builder, and manufacturer, known as &quot;The Merchant Prince of Nashville&quot;.

==Early life==
Samuel Dold Morgan was born in Staunton, Virginia.

==Career==
Morgan moved to Nashville in January 1833, where he became involved in dry goods and banking. He was at once a merchant, architect and builder. His firm, Morgan and Company, was one of the largest wholesale importers of dry goods and a manufacturer of clothing; the business was sufficiently sound and respected to be permitted to issue script money during the Panic of January 30, 1844. He was appointed to the new commission charged with planning a new State Capitol for Tennessee, becoming its president in 1854, Morgan was instrumental in choosing William Strickland of Philadelphia as the architect of this monumental structure.

In 1856, his firm built the Italianate style Morgan-Reeves Building at 208-210 Public Square; the building survived until 1975.

During the American Civil War, Morgan engaged in manufacturing munitions for the Confederates until Nashville&#x27;s occupation by Union forces. He was also a Confederate official, serving as chairman of the Central Bureau of Military Supplies in Nashville during the War. Morgan had two sons killed during the war serving in the Confederate States Army. His nephew, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan of Alabama, served with the Confederate cavalry and gained fame as the leader of Morgan&#x27;s Raiders. He was killed in 1864.

==Personal life==
Morgan was married on November 2, 1819, to Matilda Grant Rose Mackintosh of Staunton. They had 12 children.

==Death and legacy==
Morgan died in Nashville and his remains were interred in the southeast corner of the State Capitol.

Morgan Park in the historic Germantown section of Nashville was named in honor of Morgan.

On June 10, 1980, the hundredth anniversary of Samuel Morgan&#x27;s death, a ceremony was held at the Tennessee Capitol Building in his honor. The State Legislature declared that day to be &quot;Samuel Dold Morgan Day&quot; (Senate Joint Resolution 351).

<text>The Fijian coups d&#x27;état of 1987 resulted in the overthrow of the elected government of Fijian Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, the deposition of Elizabeth II as Queen of Fiji, and in the declaration of a republic. The first coup d&#x27;état, in which Bavadra was deposed, took place on 14 May 1987; a second coup d&#x27;état on 25 September ended the monarchy, and was shortly followed by the proclamation of a republic on 10 October. Both military actions were led by Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, then third in command of the Royal Fiji Military Forces.

==Background==

Both before and after Fiji gained its independence from the United Kingdom in 1970, tensions between the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian ethnic groups (comprising an estimated 46% and 49% of the 1987 population, respectively) continually manifested themselves in social and political unrest. 

Prior to the 1987 coups in Fiji, the Indian population share as a fraction of the total Fijian population was increasing. From 1946 to the late 1980s, Indians were more numerous than indigenous Fijians, with the Indian population constituting a majority in Fiji from 1956 through the late 1980s. Fiji’s Indian population expansion arose from several factors, including high post–World War II birth rates, a reduction in the indigenous Fijian population after the 1875 measles outbreak, and large-scale migration programs initiated under British colonial rule in the late 19th century, when laborers were brought from India to farm sugar cane. 

The Fijian general election of April 1987 resulted in the replacement of the indigenous-led conservative government of Prime Minister &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Kamisese Mara with a multi-ethnic Labour-led coalition supported mostly by the Indo-Fijian plurality and Rabuka claimed ethnic Fijian concerns of racial discrimination as his excuse for seizing power. Many authorities doubt the veracity of this, however, given existing constitutional guarantees.

==Coups d&#x27;etat==

=== May coup ===

On the morning of 14 May, around 10 am, a section of ten masked, armed soldiers entered the Fijian House of Representatives and subdued the national legislature, which had gathered there for its morning session. Lieutenant Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, dressed in civilian clothes, approached Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra from his position in the public gallery and ordered the members of parliament to leave the building. They did so without resisting. The coup was an apparent success and had been accomplished without loss of life.

At around 11 am, Radio Fiji announced the news of the military takeover. Rabuka was reported to have gone to Government House to see the Governor-General, &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Penaia Ganilau. He was seeking recognition of the military action and the overthrow of the Bavadra government. A caretaker government was to be named shortly, and the public was urged to &quot;remain calm and continue with their daily work.&quot; At the meeting, the Governor-General (who was Rabuka&#x27;s paramount chief) gave a mild rebuke to Rabuka. He asked him &quot;What have you done?&quot; and &quot;You mean I have no job?&quot; He added that Rabuka should have given the deposed government more time. The meeting ended with &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Penaia stating &quot;Good luck, I hope you know what you are doing.&quot;

Following the coup, the Governor-General commissioned a Constitution Review Committee, led by Sir John Falvey, to look at the &quot;deficiencies&quot; of Fiji&#x27;s 1970 constitution.

The commission was to begin hearings on 6 July and deliver its recommendations to the Governor-General by 31 July. Its terms of reference were to &quot;strengthen the representation of indigenous Fijians, and in so doing bear in mind the best interests of other peoples in Fiji.&quot; The commission received 860 written and 120 oral submissions, and produced a report recommending a new unicameral legislature comprising 36 Fijians (28 elected and 8 appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs), 22 Indo-Fijians, 8 General electors, 1 Rotuman, and up to four nominees of the Prime Minister. National constituencies, ethnically allocated and elected by universal suffrage, were to be abolished, and all voting was to be communal. The Prime Minister&#x27;s post was to be reserved for an indigenous Fijian.

The Governor-General dissolved Parliament and granted amnesty to Rabuka, while promoting him to the position of commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces. The actions of the Governor-General were viewed with suspicion by the deposed government and Bavadra challenged &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Penaia&#x27;s decision in the Supreme Court of Fiji.

=== September coup ===

From independence in 1970, Fiji&#x27;s head of state was the Queen of Fiji, Elizabeth II. The Fijian Supreme Court ruled the May coup to be totally unconstitutional, and the Governor-General attempted to assert executive reserve power. He opened negotiations known as the Deuba Talks with both the deposed government and the Alliance Party, which most indigenous Fijians supported. These negotiations culminated in the Deuba Accord of 23 September 1987, which provided for a government of national unity, in which both parties would be represented under the leadership of the Governor-General. Fearing that the gains of the first coup were about to be lost, Rabuka staged a second coup on 25 September. Rabuka then declared Fiji a republic on 7 October 1987, abrogating the Constitution of Fiji and stating that he had removed the Governor-General from office, and declaring himself Head of the Interim Military Government. &quot;Ratu&quot; Sir Penaia Ganilau resigned as Governor-General on 15 October, although he was made the first President of Fiji on 6 December 1987.

==International involvement==

Australia and New Zealand, the two nations with foremost political influence in the region, were somewhat disquieted by the event, but ultimately took no action to intervene. They did, however, establish a policy of non-recognition regarding the new government, suspending foreign aid in concert with the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Australian labour movement, taking the ousting of a labour led government as an affront to the worldwide labour movement, instituted an embargo against shipments to Fiji. As Australia was Fiji&#x27;s largest foreign trading partner, this resulted in a large diminution in Fiji&#x27;s international trade.

==Aftermath==

In the immediate aftermath of the second coup, the United Nations denounced the coup, demanding that the former government be restored. The Commonwealth responded with Fiji&#x27;s immediate expulsion from the association.

Fiji&#x27;s economy contracted by as much as 7.8% between 1987 and 1988, due to a major downturn in tourism and sugar production.

A new constitution was ratified in 1990, in which the offices of President and Prime Minister, along with two-thirds of the Senate and a substantial majority of the House of Representatives, were reserved for indigenous Fijians. These racially discriminatory provisions were eventually overturned by a constitutional revision in 1997. Fiji became a republic in the Commonwealth of Nations in late 1997.

The coups triggered much emigration by Indo-Fijians (particularly skilled workers), making them a minority by 1994.

In 2014, Rabuka admitted that Mara had told him to seize power before the coup, telling him during a golf game that &quot;the only way to change the situation now is to throw this constitution out of the window&quot;.

In December 2024 the Rabuka government established the Fiji Truth and Reconciliation Commission to inquire into the 1987, 2000, and 2006 coups. In January 2025 Rabuka said he would identify those behind the coups to the commission.

<doc id="525087" wikidata="Q107258217" url="?curid=525087" title="Murder of Yvonne Fletcher">
<text>The murder of Yvonne Fletcher, a Metropolitan Police officer, occurred on 17 April 1984, when she was fatally wounded by a shot fired from the Libyan embassy on St James&#x27;s Square, London, by an unknown gunman. Fletcher had been deployed to monitor a demonstration against the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and died shortly afterwards. Her death resulted in an eleven-day siege of the embassy, at the end of which those inside were expelled from the country and the United Kingdom severed diplomatic relations with Libya.

Between 1980 and 1984 Gaddafi had ordered the deaths of several exiled opponents of his regime; bombings and shootings, targeted at Libyan dissidents, occurred in Manchester and London. Five Libyans thought to be behind the attacks were deported from the UK. During the anti-Gaddafi protest on 17 April 1984, two gunmen opened fire from the first floor of the embassy with Sterling submachine guns. In addition to the murder of Fletcher, eleven Libyan demonstrators were wounded. The inquest into Fletcher&#x27;s death reached the verdict that she was &quot;killed by a bullet coming from one of two windows on the west side of the front on the first floor of the Libyan People&#x27;s Bureau&quot;. Following the breaking of diplomatic relations, Libya arrested six British nationals, the last four of whom were released after nine months in captivity.

Two years after Fletcher&#x27;s murder, the event became a factor in the decision by the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, to allow the US bombing of Libya from bases in the UK. In 1999, a warming of diplomatic relations between Britain and Libya led to a statement from the Libyan government admitting culpability in Fletcher&#x27;s shooting, and the payment of compensation. British police continued their investigation until 2017. Although sufficient evidence existed to prosecute one of the co-conspirators, no charges were brought as some of the evidence could not be raised in court due to national security concerns. As at 2025 no one has been convicted of Fletcher&#x27;s murder, although in 2021 the High Court of Justice determined that Gaddafi&#x27;s ally Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk was jointly liable for Fletcher&#x27;s murder.
==Background==

===Yvonne Fletcher===

Yvonne Joyce Fletcher was born on 15 June 1958 in the Wiltshire village of Semley, to Michael Fletcher and his wife Queenie (&quot;&quot; Troke). Yvonne was the eldest of the couple&#x27;s four daughters. At the age of three she told her parents that she wanted to join the police. By the time she was eighteen and a half—the minimum entry age into the Metropolitan Police Service—she was tall, shorter than the required. She applied to several police forces but was turned down on the basis of her height, and considered applying for entry to the Royal Hong Kong Police Force.

Despite the height restriction, in March 1977 Fletcher was accepted onto the Metropolitan Police 20-week training course. She passed and was placed on the standard two-year probation period with the warrant number 4257; she was posted to Bow Street police station, where she completed her probation and was confirmed as a regular Woman Police Constable (WPC). She was highly regarded by her colleagues, who nicknamed her &quot;Super Fletch&quot;, and she became engaged to PC Michael Liddle, who also worked at Bow Street.

===Relations between Britain and Libya===

From 1979 there had been no Libyan ambassador appointed to the United Kingdom. A &quot;Revolutionary Committee&quot; was in control of the Libyan embassy in London, located at 5 St James&#x27;s Square; the embassy was renamed the &quot;People&#x27;s Bureau&quot;. In 1980 Libya&#x27;s leader Muammar Gaddafi—the Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council—saw many exiles from Libya as traitors and had given orders for several of them to be murdered. On his instructions, bombs were planted in London newsagents that sold newspapers critical of Gaddafi. Moussa Koussa was appointed as Secretary of the Libyan People&#x27;s Bureau in London in 1979. He was expelled from the UK in 1980, after stating in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; that the Libyan government planned to murder two opponents of Gaddafi&#x27;s government living in the UK. The Lord Privy Seal, Sir Ian Gilmour, told the House of Commons that the government wished &quot;to maintain good relations with Libya&quot;, but that &quot;we are making it clear that the Libyan authorities must understand what can and cannot be done under the law of the United Kingdom, and that criminal actions in the United Kingdom must cease&quot;.

After several murders of Gaddafi&#x27;s political opponents in the UK in 1980, there was a decrease in activity until 1983, when the Libyan General People&#x27;s Congress—the country&#x27;s legislature—began a campaign against what they saw as the bourgeois habits of staff at several of the People&#x27;s Bureaux, particularly the office in London. In February 1983 the bureau chief and cultural attaché were recalled to Libya and replaced with a four-man committee of students who had all been involved in revolutionary activities in Libya. Soon after they were appointed, they gave a press conference at which they threatened action against Libyan dissidents. On 10 and 11 March 1984 there were a series of bomb attacks in London and Manchester targeted at critics of the Gaddafi regime. The Libyan government denied being involved, but on 16 March the British government deported five Libyans said to be connected to the attacks.

===Vienna convention and diplomatic protection===
The protection of diplomats and their official premises is based on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961, an international treaty; it was signed by 141 countries, including the UK and Libya. It was incorporated into UK law in the Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964. Among other measures, the act protects diplomats from prosecution for any crime unless the diplomat&#x27;s home country waives their right to immunity. A country can declare a diplomat from another state to be &quot;persona non grata&quot;, and demand that they leave the country, but no other action can be taken against them. Diplomatic premises are also protected from entry by the police or security services, unless given permission by the country&#x27;s ambassador.

==Shooting: 16–17 April 1984==

On 16 April 1984 two students—active opponents of Gaddafi&#x27;s rule—were executed in public hangings at the University of Tripoli. In response Libyan dissidents in Britain—members of the Libyan National Salvation Front (LNSF)—decided to stage a demonstration outside the People&#x27;s Bureau on St James&#x27;s Square. During the evening of 16 April, the People&#x27;s Bureau proposed three options to Tripoli on how to deal with the demonstration: to clash directly with the demonstrators from outside the bureau, to shoot at them from inside or to prevent the event by diplomatic means. The bureau tried the third option. During the night of 16–17 April a delegation from the People&#x27;s Bureau attended a meeting at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to complain about the forthcoming demonstration, and ask that it be stopped. The Libyans were told that the Metropolitan Police would be informed, but would be unable to prevent the demonstration from going ahead. 

During the night, Tripoli authorised the bureau to open fire on the protestors. The British political scientist Richard J. Aldrich writes that these messages were intercepted and decrypted by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), but not in time to avoid the shooting. Aldrich suggests that the delay was possibly because GCHQ did not work on the intercept outside their 9:00 am to 5:00 pm office hours. The authorised history of MI5, while not specifying from where the organisation received the information, says that &quot;it was not until after the demonstration on the 17th that the Service learned&quot; of the three options proposed by the People&#x27;s Bureau to Tripoli. On the morning of 17 April, police workmen placed crowd control barriers in St James&#x27;s Square in preparation for the demonstration. One of the Libyans from the People&#x27;s Bureau told a workman that there were guns in the bureau and there would be fighting that day. The workman passed the message on to police, who decided not to take action.

A detachment of around 30 police officers was sent to St James&#x27;s Square to monitor the demonstration; among them were Fletcher and her fiancé. They were accompanied by members of the Diplomatic Protection Group. About 75 LNSF protestors arrived from across the country, particularly northern England; the demonstration began at around 10:00 am. The demonstrators—many wearing masks or balaclavas, to ensure photographers from the People&#x27;s Bureau could not record their identities—stayed behind barriers placed opposite the Bureau; they chanted anti-Gaddafi slogans and carried banners and placards. A counter-demonstration by Gaddafi supporters had been arranged by the People&#x27;s Bureau and took place outside the building. The demonstrations were filmed by several international television crews invited by the Libyans.

At 10:18 am automatic gunfire was discharged from two windows of the People&#x27;s Bureau in the direction of the anti-Gaddafi demonstration. The shots wounded eleven protestors; according to the post-mortem examination report, one round entered Fletcher&#x27;s back, &quot; below the top of the right shoulder, to the right of the spine and behind the back fold of the right armpit&quot;. The bullet travelled right to left, through her thoracic diaphragm, liver and gall bladder before it was deflected by the spinal column out through the left side of the body, and then into the left elbow.

While the demonstrators were moved into Charles II Street, Fletcher was aided by her colleagues; as she lay in the road outside the People&#x27;s Bureau, she advised them to &quot;keep calm&quot;. She was moved to Charles II Street; she became unconscious and stopped breathing and a colleague gave her resuscitation. At 10:40 am an ambulance took her to Westminster Hospital. As she was being transferred from the ambulance to a hospital trolley, a single spent round of ammunition fell from her uniform. She was operated on, but died at approximately midday.

The police evacuated members of the public from the offices around the square, which they sealed off with a cordon; armed police took up positions facing the People&#x27;s Bureau and on the surrounding rooftops. The garage entrance at the rear of the People&#x27;s Bureau was not sealed off until at least ten minutes after the shooting, and in that time some of those inside departed the premises through that exit.

With Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister, on an official visit to Portugal, and Geoffrey Howe, the Foreign Secretary, in China, responsibility for handling the crisis fell to Leon Brittan, the Home Secretary. Events spread to Libya soon after the shooting, as around 60 members of the Revolutionary Guard Corps surrounded the British embassy in Tripoli, and put the premises under siege, trapping the staff of 25—including Oliver Miles, the ambassador. Three British nationals working in Tripoli were arrested on unspecified charges.

The post-mortem on Fletcher was undertaken in the evening of 17 April by the forensic pathologist Iain West. Examining the entry of the shot, he wrote that:

The angle of the bullet wound indicates that she was shot in the back by a person who was situated at a considerably higher level. Assuming that she was standing upright at the moment she was shot, the track would indicate that she had been shot from one of the adjacent floors of an adjacent building.

From the angle of the entry wound, and Fletcher&#x27;s position in the street—captured on news cameras seconds before she was shot—West established that the shot had come from the first floor of the embassy.

==Siege: 18–27 April 1984==
On 18 April, Miles was allowed to leave the British embassy to meet representatives of the Libyan government; the siege in Tripoli was lifted that day and one of the men arrested the previous day was also released. The following day Gaddafi appeared on Libyan television and blamed the British police and security forces for the attack; he said that &quot;we are surprised how a responsible state like England carry on committing this crime&quot;. Over the next week five bombs were planted in London, four of which were defused; on 20 April the fifth bomb exploded in the baggage area of Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport, for which police suspected Libyan bombers. The British government&#x27;s attitude towards Libya hardened as a result of the bombs, although they were also sensitive to Libya&#x27;s behaviour in previous diplomatic impasses, whereby the regime would arrest citizens of a country and hold them until the normalisation of formal relations. There were 8,000 British workers in Libya, mostly working in the oil and construction industries.

The British government requested access to the People&#x27;s Bureau, which was denied by the Libyan government. Two Libyan diplomats who were not in the embassy at the time of the shooting acted as intermediaries between police negotiators and those inside the building. The government also put the Special Air Service on standby; they flew from Stirling Lines, their base in Credenhill, Herefordshire, to London in preparation. Negotiations did not progress well, and on 22 April Britain informed the Libyan government that diplomatic ties were broken; the diplomats in the embassy were given until midnight on 29 April to leave the country, and Britain instructed its embassy staff to leave Tripoli by the same time.

Fletcher&#x27;s hat and four other officers&#x27; helmets were left lying in the square during the ensuing siege. In the days that followed, images of them were repeatedly shown in the British media. In the early morning of 27 April a policeman acted against orders and retrieved the hat from the square. It was placed on Fletcher&#x27;s coffin for her funeral, which took place the same day at Salisbury Cathedral. In addition to 600 police officers, Leon Brittan attended, as did Lawrence Byford, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary and Kenneth Newman, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police.

On the same day as Fletcher&#x27;s funeral the evacuation of the embassy began with the dispatch of diplomatic luggage—four canvas bags, marked with a diplomatic seal, and immune from search or seizure by the British police. Neutral intermediaries from Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey oversaw the exit of goods and staff. The 30 staff in the embassy were allowed out in groups of five, instructed to walk in single-file with a gap between each of them; there was a 15-minute pause between each group exiting the building. Each person was frisked, photographed and questioned, but when attempts were made to fingerprint the men, they objected and the neutral intermediaries advised the police that this was not allowed. After being taken to the Civil Service College at Sunningdale where they were held for the day and questioned, the Libyans were put on a flight to Tripoli just before 8:00 pm. The same day, the remaining members of staff from the British embassy, including the ambassador, returned to London.

==Aftermath: 27 April 1984 – 5 February 1985==
Once the Libyans had left the People&#x27;s Bureau, police forensics teams entered and searched the square and the embassy building. Within the building—where they spent four days searching—gunshot residue was found at two windows on the first floor and a spent cartridge. With that evidence, and from the location of the bullets in the square, the police ascertained that two Sterling submachine guns had been fired, one pointing down at the demonstrators and one on a flatter trajectory across the square. The police search of the bureau found 4,367 rounds of ammunition, three semi-automatic pistols, four .38 revolvers and magazines for Sterling submachine guns. The search of the embassy was made by civilian experts employed by the police, accompanied by observers from Saudi Arabia.

The inquest into Fletcher&#x27;s death opened on 25 April but was adjourned to allow for the police to undertake further investigations. When it reconvened, police reported that they had 400 lines of enquiry open into the murder, but had not narrowed the field of suspects down from any of the 30 Libyans in the embassy. Iain West stated that the bullet entered Fletcher&#x27;s body at an angle of between 60 and 70 degrees. Paul Knapman, the coroner heading the inquest, considered the angle too steep to have been fired from the first floor and questioned West on the point. The pathologist stated that Fletcher must have been turning when she was shot which, he said, would have reduced the angle. The jury concluded that Fletcher &quot;was killed by a bullet coming from one of two windows on the west side of the front on the first floor of the Libyan People&#x27;s Bureau&quot;.

In April and May 1984 six British men working in Libya were rounded up and detained as hostages by a Revolutionary Committee. The Libyans demanded the restoration of diplomatic relations and the release of Libyans arrested on terror offences. Two of the men were freed in September, and in October Terry Waite—special envoy for the Archbishop of Canterbury—visited Libya in an attempt to negotiate the release of the remaining men, the first of his four visits. The hostages were freed on 5 February 1985, after nine months in detention.

==Subsequent developments==

===Gaddafi era: 1985–2011===
Although there were rumours that four members of the embassy had been executed on their return to Libya, the reports were not considered reliable by the British government. The government did not try to re-open diplomatic relations with Libya for several years, and interaction between the two governments remained poor. In 1986 Thatcher agreed to the use of Royal Air Force bases by American aircraft involved in the bombing of Libya; she said in the House of Commons that the murder of Fletcher weighed in her decision. In 1991 the warrants issued to two Libyan men for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing further damaged British–Libyan relations. Abdul Fatah Younis, Libya&#x27;s Minister for Public Security, met Christopher Long, Britain&#x27;s ambassador to Egypt in 1992. Younis apologised for his country&#x27;s role in Fletcher&#x27;s murder, and offered to assist with the extradition of her killers; the offer was not accepted, but led to discussions between the two countries, which were kept secret.

The Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; documentary, broadcast in April 1996, posited that the shots were fired from a different building, from an upper floor that had been rented by MI5, and that the shots had been from agents of MI5 or the American CIA, to discredit the Libyan regime. The contents of the programme were raised in question in the House of Commons by Tam Dalyell, and answered by David Maclean, the Minister of State for Home Affairs, who stated that &quot;The programme asks us to believe that WPC Fletcher was murdered by, or with the connivance of, a British or American intelligence officer. If it were not so offensive and obscene, it would be laughable.&quot; He concluded that it was the Libyans in the bureau who should co-operate with the murder investigation.

In July 1999 the Libyan government publicly accepted responsibility for the murder, agreed to pay compensation of £250,000 to Fletcher&#x27;s family and agreed to support the investigation into Fletcher&#x27;s murder. In a statement to the House of Commons, the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook announced:

Libya accepts general responsibility for the actions of those in the Libyan People&#x27;s Bureau at the time of the shooting. It expresses deep regret to the family of WPC Fletcher for what occurred and offers to pay compensation now to the family. Libya agrees to participate in and co-operate with the continuing police investigation and to accept its outcome.

On 24 February 2004 the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4 reported that Shukri Ghanem, the Libyan prime minister, had claimed his country was not responsible for Fletcher&#x27;s murder or for the Lockerbie bombing. Ghanem said that Libya had made the admission and paid compensation to bring peace and an end to international sanctions. The following day a statement on Libyan radio said that Ghanem&#x27;s comment was &quot;inaccurate and regrettable&quot;; the Libyan government offered entry to Libya for the Metropolitan Police to undertake its investigation in Tripoli. Although they were able to undertake some steps during their four-day investigation, they were not allowed to arrest anyone. On their return it was announced that a joint investigation by British police and a Libyan magistrate would undertake a formal investigation under Libyan law.

British detectives were able to interview their main suspect for the murder in June 2007, following the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the UK and Libya. Detectives spent seven weeks in Libya interviewing both witnesses and suspects. Queenie, Fletcher&#x27;s mother, described the developments as &quot;promising&quot;. That year a senior Canadian lawyer undertook a review of the available evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service. He advised that Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, a junior diplomat in the People&#x27;s Bureau at the time of the shooting, had been identified by witnesses who had observed him firing a weapon from the embassy window. The report also suggested that there was sufficient evidence for two men, Matouk Mohammed Matouk and Abdulqadir al-Baghdadi, to face charges of conspiracy to murder. Both had escaped out of the garage door of the embassy on the day of the shooting; neither had diplomatic status and could, therefore, face prosecution. The report was not publicly released, but a leaked copy was obtained by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2009.

In 2009 Gaddafi was interviewed by Sky News and apologised for the killing of Fletcher. The same year it was established that during trade negotiations between Britain and Libya in 2006, an agreement was reached that Fletcher&#x27;s killer would not be extradited for trial in the UK. In a letter to Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, the Police Federation said they were &quot;appalled and disgusted&quot; by the decision. A spokesman for the Foreign Office denied that there was a secret deal, and stated that &quot;Libyan law did not allow for the extradition for trial in other countries so a trial in Libya was the only outcome that would reflect our determination to see justice done&quot;.

===Post-Gaddafi era: 2011–2021===
Following the 2011 Libyan civil war and the collapse of the Gaddafi regime in August that year, it was reported that one of the co-conspirators, Abdulqadir al-Baghdadi, had been killed during in-fighting among Gaddafi loyalists. In June the following year, two police officers flew to Libya to discuss developments in the case. The following month &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; named Salah Eddin Khalifa, a high-level member of the former regime, as the pro-Gaddafi student who shot Fletcher. Within minutes of the shooting, he had left the embassy via a back door before it was surrounded by police. Khalifa was said to have moved to another north African city following the civil war.

In November 2015 the Metropolitan Police arrested Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, a former member of the Gaddafi government and a close ally of Gaddafi who was a key member of the revolutionary committee in control of the embassy on that day; in 2011 he claimed political asylum in the UK. Although initially arrested on charges of money laundering, he was bailed on charges of conspiracy to murder Fletcher. In May 2017 the charges against him were dropped as evidence against him could not be provided in court because of national security concerns.

In November 2019, Fletcher&#x27;s former colleague John Murray said he was still trying to find the murderer; in November 2021 a civil case he brought against Mabrouk, was heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Mabrouk was found to be jointly liable for Fletcher&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==

In April 1984 the film director Michael Winner wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; to suggest that a memorial be placed in St James&#x27;s Square &quot;to commemorate not only the horrific death of this brave young girl, but also be a constant reminder to her killers of the feelings of the British people&quot;. After receiving sizeable donations, Winner set up the Police Memorial Trust on 3 May to erect memorials to honour British police officers killed in the line of duty.

Fletcher became the first police officer honoured by the Police Memorial Trust. On 1 February 1985 her memorial was unveiled in St James&#x27;s Square by Thatcher, in a ceremony attended by the leaders of the main British political parties. During her unveiling speech, Thatcher said:

This simple memorial, erected by the Police Memorial Trust, will be a reminder to Londoners and to visitors alike of the debt that we owe to Yvonne Fletcher and all her colleagues in the Police. Without them the law could not be upheld. Without them, indeed, there would be no law, and no liberty.

The granite and Portland stone commemorative pillar lies in the north-east corner of St James&#x27;s Square, facing the former Libyan embassy. Westminster City Council altered part of the pavement with a rounded extension into the roadway to create an area for people to stand in front of it.

A cherry tree was planted in St James&#x27;s Square in memory of Fletcher in 1984, and there is a memorial plaque in Charing Cross Police Station, London. In 1988 John Baker, the Bishop of Salisbury dedicated a stained glass window at St Leonard&#x27;s Church, Semley, to Fletcher; the window was designed by the artist Henry Haig.

Following a government review into the law surrounding inviolability of diplomatic premises, the Diplomatic and Consular Premises Act 1987 was introduced. Among other measures, the act allows the government to remove diplomatic status from premises which they consider to be misused.

<text>Maria Schneider (born August 18, 1968) is an American humorist, cartoonist and illustrator best known for her work with the satirical online newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; and her comic strip &quot;Pathetic Geek Stories&quot;.

Born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin, Schneider moved to New York City with the staff of &quot;The Onion&quot; in 2001. Her contributions include writing humor columns as a variety of characters: T. Herman Zweibel, Jean Teasdale and Herbert Kornfeld.

Schneider&#x27;s comic strip, &quot;Pathetic Geek Stories&quot;, illustrates tales of pain and humiliation, usually during adolescence, sent to her by readers. In 2004, &quot;Pathetic Geek Stories&quot; formally ceased to be a feature in &quot;The Onion&quot;, moving to its own website. The site had not been updated since November 2008.

==Books==
In 2010, &quot;The Onion Presents A Book of Jean&#x27;s Own!&quot;, a book-length collection of new material written by Schneider as Jean Teasdale, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin. The book&#x27;s front cover was illustrated by Mort Drucker. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; gave it a mixed review.

<text>In mathematics, a submanifold of a manifold formula_1 is a subset formula_2 which itself has the structure of a manifold, and for which the inclusion map formula_3 satisfies certain properties. There are different types of submanifolds depending on exactly which properties are required. Different authors often have different definitions.

==Formal definition==

In the following we assume all manifolds are differentiable manifolds of class formula_4 for a fixed formula_5, and all morphisms are differentiable of class formula_4.

===Immersed submanifolds===
An immersed submanifold of a manifold formula_1 is the image formula_2 of an immersion map formula_9; in general this image will not be a submanifold as a subset, and an immersion map need not even be injective (one-to-one) – it can have self-intersections.

More narrowly, one can require that the map formula_9 be an injection (one-to-one), in which we call it an injective immersion, and define an immersed submanifold to be the image subset formula_2 together with a topology and differential structure such that formula_2 is a manifold and the inclusion formula_13 is a diffeomorphism: this is just the topology on formula_14&quot;,&quot; which in general will not agree with the subset topology: in general the subset formula_2 is not a submanifold of formula_1&quot;,&quot; in the subset topology.

Given any injective immersion formula_9 the image of formula_14 in formula_1 can be uniquely given the structure of an immersed submanifold so that formula_20 is a diffeomorphism. It follows that immersed submanifolds are precisely the images of injective immersions.

The submanifold topology on an immersed submanifold need not be the subspace topology inherited from formula_1. In general, it will be finer than the subspace topology (i.e. have more open sets).

Immersed submanifolds occur in the theory of Lie groups where Lie subgroups are naturally immersed submanifolds. They also appear in the study of foliations where immersed submanifolds provide the right context to prove the Frobenius theorem.

===Embedded submanifolds===

An embedded submanifold (also called a regular submanifold), is an immersed submanifold for which the inclusion map is a topological embedding. That is, the submanifold topology on formula_2 is the same as the subspace topology.

Given any embedding formula_9 of a manifold formula_14 in formula_1 the image formula_26 naturally has the structure of an embedded submanifold. That is, embedded submanifolds are precisely the images of embeddings.

There is an intrinsic definition of an embedded submanifold which is often useful. Let formula_1 be an formula_28-dimensional manifold, and let formula_29 be an integer such that formula_30. A formula_29-dimensional embedded submanifold of formula_1 is a subset formula_33 such that for every point formula_34 there exists a chart formula_35 containing formula_36 such that formula_37 is the intersection of a formula_29-dimensional plane with formula_39. The pairs formula_40 form an atlas for the differential structure on formula_2.

Alexander&#x27;s theorem and the Jordan–Schoenflies theorem are good examples of smooth embeddings.

===Other variations===

There are some other variations of submanifolds used in the literature. A neat submanifold is a manifold whose boundary agrees with the boundary of the entire manifold. Sharpe (1997) defines a type of submanifold which lies somewhere between an embedded submanifold and an immersed submanifold.

Many authors define topological submanifolds also. These are the same as formula_4 submanifolds with formula_43. An embedded topological submanifold is not necessarily regular in the sense of the existence of a local chart at each point extending the embedding. Counterexamples include wild arcs and wild knots.

==Properties==

Given any immersed submanifold formula_2 of formula_1, the tangent space to a point formula_36 in formula_2 can naturally be thought of as a linear subspace of the tangent space to formula_36 in formula_1. This follows from the fact that the inclusion map is an immersion and provides an injection
: formula_50

Suppose &quot;S&quot; is an immersed submanifold of formula_1. If the inclusion map formula_52 is closed then formula_2 is actually an embedded submanifold of formula_1. Conversely, if formula_2 is an embedded submanifold which is also a closed subset then the inclusion map is closed. The inclusion map formula_52 is closed if and only if it is a proper map (i.e. inverse images of compact sets are compact). If formula_57 is closed then formula_2 is called a closed embedded submanifold of formula_1. Closed embedded submanifolds form the nicest class of submanifolds.

==Submanifolds of real coordinate space==

Smooth manifolds are sometimes &quot;defined&quot; as embedded submanifolds of real coordinate space formula_60, for some formula_28. This point of view is equivalent to the usual, abstract approach, because, by the Whitney embedding theorem, any second-countable smooth (abstract) formula_62-manifold can be smoothly embedded in formula_63.

<text>A monument is a type of structure that was explicitly created to commemorate a person or event, or which has become relevant to a social group as a part of their remembrance of historic times or cultural heritage, due to its artistic, historical, political, technical or architectural importance. Examples of monuments include statues, (war) memorials, historical buildings, archaeological sites, and cultural assets. If there is a public interest in its preservation, a monument can for example be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The &quot;Palgrave Encyclopedia of Cultural Heritage and Conflict&quot; gives the next definition of monument:Monuments result from social practices of construction or conservation of material artifacts through which the ideology of their promoters is manifested. The concept of the modern monument emerged with the development of capital and the nation-state in the fifteenth century when the ruling classes began to build and conserve what were termed monuments. These practices proliferated significantly in the nineteenth century, creating the ideological frameworks for their conservation as a universal humanist duty. The twentieth century has marked a movement toward some monuments being conceived as cultural heritage in the form of remains to be preserved, and concerning commemorative monuments, there has been a shift toward the abstract counter monument. In both cases, their conflictive nature is explicit in the need for their conservation, given that a fundamental component of state action following the construction or declaration of monuments is litigating vandalism and iconoclasm. However, not all monuments represent the interests of nation-states and the ruling classes; their forms are also employed beyond Western borders and by social movements as part of subversive practices which use monuments as a means of expression, where forms previously exclusive to European elites are used by new social groups or for generating anti-monumental artifacts that directly challenge the state and the ruling classes. In conflicts, therefore, it is not so much the monument which is relevant but rather what happens to the communities that participate in its construction or destruction and their instigation of forms of social interaction.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;monument&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;monumentum&quot;, derived from the word &quot;moneo&quot;, &quot;monere&quot;, which means &#x27;to remind&#x27; or &#x27;to warn&#x27;, suggesting a monument allows us to see the past thus helping us visualize what is to come in the future. In English the word &quot;monumental&quot; is often used in reference to something of extraordinary size and power, as in monumental sculpture, but also to mean simply anything made to commemorate the dead, as a funerary monument or other example of funerary art.

== Creation and functions ==
A formalist interpretation of monuments suggests their origins date back to antiquity and even prehistory. Archaeologists like Gordon Childe viewed ancient monuments as symbols of power. Historians such as Lewis Mumford proposed that the practice began with Paleolithic landmarks, which served as sites for communication with ancestral spirits. However, these perspectives often project modern uses of monuments onto ancient structures. In art history, monuments are seen as significant sculptural forms; in architecture and urban planning, they are crucial for city organization and mapping. These contemporary interpretations have been retroactively applied to ancient and non-Western structures. This modern concept of monuments aligns with how past constructions are labeled as monuments today. Françóise Choay highlights the distinction between these views: &quot;The historic monument is a precisely datable invention of the West... exported and diffused beyond Europe from the late nineteenth century.&quot; Basically, the definition framework of the term monument depends on the current historical frame conditions. Aspects of the Culture of Remembrance and cultural memory are also linked to it, as well as questions about the concepts of public sphere and durability (of the one memorized) and the form and content of the monument (work-like monument). From an art historical point of view, the dichotomy of content and form opens up the problem of the &quot;linguistic ability&quot; of the monument. It becomes clear that language is an eminent part of a monument and it is often represented in &quot;non-objective&quot; or &quot;architectural monuments&quot;, at least with a plaque. In this connection, the debate touches on the social mechanisms that combine with Remembrance. These are acceptance of the monument as an object, the conveyed contents and the impact of these contents.

Monuments are frequently used to improve the appearance of a city or location. Planned cities such as Washington, D.C., New Delhi and Brasília are often built around monuments. For example, the Washington Monument&#x27;s location was conceived by L&#x27;Enfant to help organize public space in the city, before it was designed or constructed. Older cities have monuments placed at locations that are already important or are sometimes redesigned to focus on one. As Shelley suggested in his famous poem &quot;Ozymandias&quot; (&quot;Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&quot;), the purpose of monuments is very often to impress or awe.

Structures created for other purposes that have been made notable by their age, size or historic significance may also be regarded as monuments. This can happen because of great age and size, as in the case of the Great Wall of China, or because an event of great importance occurred there such as the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in France. Many countries use &#x27;ancient monument&#x27; or similar terms for the official designation of protected structures or archeological sites which may originally have been ordinary domestic houses or other buildings.

Monuments are also often designed to convey historical or political information, and they can thus develop an active socio-political potency. They can be used to reinforce the primacy of contemporary political power, such as the column of Trajan or the numerous statues of Lenin in the Soviet Union. They can be used to educate the populace about important events or figures from the past, such as in the renaming of the old General Post Office Building in New York City to the James A. Farley Building, after James Farley, former Postmaster General of the United States. To fulfill its informative and educative functions a monument needs to be open to the public, which means that its spatial dimension, as well as its content can be experienced by the public, and be sustainable. The former may be achieved either by situating the monument in public space or by a public discussion about the monument and its meaning, the latter by the materiality of the monument or if its content immediately becomes part of the collective or cultural memory.

The social meanings of monuments are rarely fixed and certain and are frequently &#x27;contested&#x27; by different social groups. As an example: whilst the former East German socialist state may have seen the Berlin Wall as a means of &#x27;protection&#x27; from the ideological impurity of the west, dissidents and others would often argue that it was symbolic of the inherent repression and paranoia of that state. This contention of meaning is a central theme of modern &#x27;post processual&#x27; archaeological discourse.

== Loss and destruction ==
While many ancient monuments still exist today, there are notable incidents of monuments being intentionally or accidentally destroyed and many monuments are likely to have disappeared through the passage of time and natural forces such as erosion. In 772 during the Saxon Wars, Charlemagne intentionally destroyed an Irminsul monument in order to desecrate the pagan religion. In 1687 the Parthenon in Athens was partially destroyed by a Venetian mortar round, which set off the store of gunpowder kept there by the Turkish defenders. 

A recent archeological dig in central France uncovered the remains of a Megalithic monument that had been previously destroyed &quot;Like some monuments, including Belz in Morbihan, the menhirs of Veyre-Monton were knocked down in order to make them disappear from the landscape. Pushed into large pits, sometimes mutilated or covered with earth, these monoliths have been destroyed. &#x27;object of iconoclastic gestures, a sort of condemnation perhaps linked to some change of community or beliefs &quot;

== Protection and preservation ==
The term is often used to describe any structure that is a significant and legally protected historic work, and many countries have equivalents of what is called in United Kingdom legislation a Scheduled Monument, which often include relatively recent buildings constructed for residential or industrial purposes, with no thought at the time that they would come to be regarded as &quot;monuments&quot;.

Until recently, it was customary for archaeologists to study large monuments and pay less attention to the everyday lives of the societies that created them. New ideas about what constitutes the archaeological record have revealed that certain legislative and theoretical approaches to the subject are too focused on earlier definitions of monuments. An example has been the United Kingdom&#x27;s Scheduled Ancient Monument laws.

Other than municipal or national government that protecting the monuments in their jurisdiction, there are institutions dedicated on the efforts to protect and preserve monuments that considered to possess special natural or cultural significance for the world, such as UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Site programme and World Monuments Fund.

Cultural monuments are also considered to be the memory of a community and are therefore particularly at risk in the context of modern asymmetrical warfare. The enemy&#x27;s cultural heritage is to be sustainably damaged or even destroyed. In addition to the national protection of cultural monuments, international organizations (cf. UNESCO World Heritage, Blue Shield International) therefore try to protect cultural monuments.

Recently, more and more monuments are being preserved digitally (in 3D models) through organisations as CyArk.

== Types ==

* Benchmarks placed by a government agency or private survey firm.
* Buildings designed as landmarks, usually built with an extraordinary feature, such being designed as the tallest, largest, or most distinctive design, e.g., the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world&#x27;s tallest structure or the One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the United States, built to memorialize the attack on September 11.
* Cenotaphs (intended to honour the dead who are buried elsewhere) and other memorials to commemorate the dead, usually war casualties, e.g., India Gate and Vimy Ridge Memorial, or disaster casualties, such as the &quot;Titanic&quot; Memorial, Belfast.
* Church monuments to commemorate the faithful dead, located above or near their grave, often featuring an effigy, e.g., St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica or the medieval church Sta Maria di Collemaggio in L&#x27;Aquila.
* Columns, often topped with a statue, e.g., Berlin Victory Column, Nelson&#x27;s Column in London, and Trajan&#x27;s Column in Rome.
* Eternal flames that are kept burning continuously, usually lit to honor unknown soldiers, e.g., at the Tomb of Unknown Soldier in Moscow or at the John F. Kennedy gravesite in Virginia&#x27;s Arlington National Cemetery.

* Fountains, water-pouring structures usually placed in formal gardens or town squares, e.g., Fontaines de la Concorde and Gardens of Versailles.
* Gravestones, small monuments to the deceased, placed at their gravesites, e.g., the tombs and vaults of veterans in Les Invalides and Srebrenica Genocide Memorial.
* Mausoleums and tombs to honor the dead, e.g., the Great Pyramid of Giza, Libyco-Punic Mausoleum of Dougga and Taj Mahal.
* Monoliths erected for religious or commemorative purposes, e.g., Stonehenge.
* Mosque Monuments, places of worship that generally have domes and minarets that stand out against the skyline. They also usually feature highly skilled Islamic calligraphy and geometric artwork, e.g., the Mosque of the Prophet.
* Mounds erected to commemorate great leaders or events, e.g., Kościuszko Mound.
* Obelisks, usually erected to commemorate great leaders, e.g., Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle in London, the National Monument (&quot;Monas&quot;) in Central Jakarta, and the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.
* Palaces, imposing royal residences designed to impress people with their grandeur and greatness, e.g., Forbidden City in Beijing, Palace of Versailles, and Schwerin Palace in Schwerin.
* Searchlights to project a powerful beam of light, e.g., &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; in the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum in New York City, commemorating the September 11 attacks of 2001.
* Statues of famous individuals or symbols, e.g., the Niederwalddenkmal (&quot;Germania&quot;) in Hesse, &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; (commonly known as the Statue of Liberty) in New York City, and &quot;The Motherland Calls&quot; in Volgograd.
* Temples or religious structures built for pilgrimage, ritual or commemorative purposes, e.g., Borobudur in Magelang and Kaaba in Mecca.
* Terminating Vistas, layout design for urban monuments on the end of an avenue, e.g., Opera Garnier in Paris.
* Triumphal arches, almost always to commemorate military successes, e.g., the Arch of Constantine in Rome and Arc de Triomphe de l&#x27;Étoile in Paris.
* War memorials, e.g., the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington, VA, the Laboe Naval Memorial, the Lorraine American Cemetery and Memorial in St Avold, and the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin.

<text>In geometry, a hypersurface is a generalization of the concepts of hyperplane, plane curve, and surface. A hypersurface is a manifold or an algebraic variety of dimension , which is embedded in an ambient space of dimension , generally a Euclidean space, an affine space or a projective space.
Hypersurfaces share, with surfaces in a three-dimensional space, the property of being defined by a single implicit equation, at least locally (near every point), and sometimes globally.

A hypersurface in a (Euclidean, affine, or projective) space of dimension two is a plane curve. In a space of dimension three, it is a surface. 

For example, the equation
:formula_1
defines an algebraic hypersurface of dimension in the Euclidean space of dimension . This hypersurface is also a smooth manifold, and is called a hypersphere or an -sphere.

==Smooth hypersurface==

A hypersurface that is a smooth manifold is called a &quot;smooth hypersurface&quot;.

In , a smooth hypersurface is orientable. Every connected compact smooth hypersurface is a level set, and separates R&quot;n&quot; into two connected components; this is related to the Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem.

==Affine algebraic hypersurface ==

An algebraic hypersurface is an algebraic variety that may be defined by a single implicit equation of the form
:formula_2
where is a multivariate polynomial. Generally the polynomial is supposed to be irreducible. When this is not the case, the hypersurface is not an algebraic variety, but only an algebraic set. It may depend on the authors or the context whether a reducible polynomial defines a hypersurface. For avoiding ambiguity, the term &quot;irreducible hypersurface&quot; is often used. 

As for algebraic varieties, the coefficients of the defining polynomial may belong to any fixed field , and the points of the hypersurface are the zeros of in the affine space formula_3 where is an algebraically closed extension of .

A hypersurface may have singularities, which are the common zeros, if any, of the defining polynomial and its partial derivatives. In particular, a real algebraic hypersurface is not necessarily a manifold.

===Properties===
Hypersurfaces have some specific properties that are not shared with other algebraic varieties. 

One of the main such properties is Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz, which asserts that a hypersurface contains a given algebraic set if and only if the defining polynomial of the hypersurface has a power that belongs to the ideal generated by the defining polynomials of the algebraic set.

A corollary of this theorem is that, if two irreducible polynomials (or more generally two square-free polynomials) define the same hypersurface, then one is the product of the other by a nonzero constant.

Hypersurfaces are exactly the subvarieties of dimension of an affine space of dimension of . This is the geometric interpretation of the fact that, in a polynomial ring over a field, the height of an ideal is 1 if and only if the ideal is a principal ideal. In the case of possibly reducible hypersurfaces, this result may be restated as follows: hypersurfaces are exactly the algebraic sets whose all irreducible components have dimension .

===Real and rational points ===
A &quot;real hypersurface&quot; is a hypersurface that is defined by a polynomial with real coefficients. In this case the algebraically closed field over which the points are defined is generally the field formula_4 of complex numbers. The &quot;real points&quot; of a real hypersurface are the points that belong to formula_5 The set of the real points of a real hypersurface is the &quot;real part&quot; of the hypersurface. Often, it is left to the context whether the term &quot;hypersurface&quot; refers to all points or only to the real part.

If the coefficients of the defining polynomial belong to a field that is not algebraically closed (typically the field of rational numbers, a finite field or a number field), one says that the hypersurface is &quot;defined over&quot; , and the points that belong to formula_6 are &quot;rational&quot; over (in the case of the field of rational numbers, &quot;over &quot; is generally omitted).

For example, the imaginary -sphere defined by the equation
:formula_7
is a real hypersurface without any real point, which is defined over the rational numbers. It has no rational point, but has many points that are rational over the Gaussian rationals.

==Projective algebraic hypersurface==

A of dimension in a projective space of dimension over a field is defined by a homogeneous polynomial formula_8 in indeterminates. As usual, means that all monomials of have the same degree, or, equivalently that formula_9 for every constant , where is the degree of the polynomial. The of the hypersurface are the points of the projective space whose projective coordinates are zeros of .

If one chooses the hyperplane of equation formula_10 as hyperplane at infinity, the complement of this hyperplane is an affine space, and the points of the projective hypersurface that belong to this affine space form an affine hypersurface of equation formula_11 Conversely, given an affine hypersurface of equation formula_2 it defines a projective hypersurface, called its , whose equation is obtained by homogenizing . That is, the equation of the projective completion is formula_13 with 
:formula_14 
where is the degree of .

These two processes projective completion and restriction to an affine subspace are inverse one to the other. Therefore, an affine hypersurface and its projective completion have essentially the same properties, and are often considered as two points-of-view for the same hypersurface. 

However, it may occur that an affine hypersurface is nonsingular, while its projective completion has singular points. In this case, one says that the affine surface is . For example, the circular cylinder of equation 
:formula_15 
in the affine space of dimension three has a unique singular point, which is at infinity, in the direction .

<text>Tombstone is a 1993 American Western film directed by George P. Cosmatos, written by Kevin Jarre (who was also the original director, but was replaced early in production), and starring Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, with Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, and Dana Delany in supporting roles, and narration by Robert Mitchum.

The film is loosely based on real events that took place in the 1880s in Southeast Arizona, including the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the Earp Vendetta Ride. It depicts several Western outlaws and lawmen, such as Wyatt Earp, William Brocius, Johnny Ringo, and Doc Holliday.
&quot;Tombstone&quot; was released by Hollywood Pictures in theatrical wide release in the United States on December 25, 1993, grossing $73.2 million worldwide. The film was a financial success, and in the Western genre, it ranks number 16 in the list of highest-grossing films since 1979. Critical reception was generally positive, with the story, directing, and acting receiving praise. Particular praise went towards Val Kilmer&#x27;s memorable performance as the hard-drinking Doc Holliday. The film has become a cult classic since its release.

==Plot==
In 1879, members of an outlaw gang known to wear red sashes called the Cowboys, led by &quot;Curly Bill&quot; Brocius, ride into a Mexican town and interrupt a local police officer&#x27;s wedding. They then proceed to massacre the assembled policemen in retribution for killing two of their fellow gang members. Shortly before being shot, a local priest warns them that their acts of murder and savagery will be avenged, referencing the biblical Four Horseman of the Apocalypse.

Wyatt Earp, a retired peace officer with a notable reputation, reunites with his brothers Virgil and Morgan in Tucson, Arizona, where they venture on toward Tombstone to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt&#x27;s long-time friend Doc Holliday, who is seeking relief in the dry climate from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus and Mr. Fabian are also newly arrived with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt&#x27;s common-law wife, Mattie Blaylock, is becoming dependent on laudanum. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with the Cowboys.

As tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys, though he is no longer a lawman. After a visit to an opium den, Curly Bill begins shooting erratically in the street. Marshal Fred White attempts to disarm him, only to be shot dead. Wyatt takes Curly Bill into custody, fending off both a mob attempting to lynch the Cowboy and a handful of his brethren seeking to free him. Curly Bill stands trial but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate the chaos, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan with the Cowboys is made clear. In retaliation for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt&#x27;s brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Ike Clanton and Frank Stilwell close behind, preparing to ambush them. Having been appointed a US Marshal, Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely, and then surprises the assassins. He kills Stilwell but lets Clanton live to carry a message: He has vowed to put an end to the Cowboys. Wyatt, Doc, a reformed Cowboy named Sherman McMasters, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson form a posse to seek revenge.

Wyatt and his posse are ambushed in a riverside forest by the Cowboys. Wyatt walks into the creek, miraculously surviving the enemy fire, and kills Curly Bill along with many of his men. Curly Bill&#x27;s second-in-command, Johnny Ringo, becomes the new head of the Cowboys. When Doc&#x27;s health worsens, the group is accommodated by Henry Hooker at his ranch. Ringo lures McMasters into the Cowboys&#x27; clutches under the pretense of parley and then sends a messenger (dragging McMasters&#x27; corpse) to tell Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities; Wyatt agrees. Wyatt sets off for the showdown, not knowing that Doc has already arrived at the scene. Doc confronts a surprised Ringo, who was expecting Wyatt, and challenges him to a duel to finish their &quot;game,&quot; which Ringo accepts (Doc and Ringo have already had a couple of stand-offs in Tombstone that were ultimately broken up). Wyatt runs when he hears a gunshot, only to encounter Doc, who has killed Ringo. They then press on to complete their task of eliminating the Cowboys, although Clanton escapes their vengeance by renouncing his red sash. Doc is sent to a sanatorium in Colorado, where he dies of his illness. At Doc&#x27;s urging, Wyatt pursues Josephine to begin a new life.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot primarily on location in Arizona. Shooting began in May 1993. The film was supposed to be screenwriter Kevin Jarre&#x27;s first job as director but he was quickly overwhelmed by the job, failing to get needed shots and falling behind the shooting schedule. A month into filming, he was fired by producer Andrew Vajna and replaced with George P. Cosmatos. Michael Biehn, a close friend of Jarre, considered quitting. Biehn recalled feeling (director) Cosmatos &quot;...had no understanding or appreciation of the screenplay.&quot; By the time of Cosmatos&#x27; arrival, though, all actors stayed on board. The new director brought a demanding, hard-nosed sensibility to the set, which led to conflicts with some of the crew members (most famously with cinematographer William Fraker). Meanwhile, Kurt Russell worked quickly with producer James Jacks to pare down Jarre&#x27;s sprawling script, deleting subplots and emphasizing the relationship between Wyatt and Doc.
Russell has stated that it was he, and not Cosmatos, who directed the film, as Jarre&#x27;s departure led to the studio&#x27;s request. Russell stated that Cosmatos was brought in as a &quot;ghost director&quot; as a frontman because Russell did not want it to be known that he was directing. Co-star Val Kilmer has supported Russell&#x27;s statements about working heavily behind the scenes and stating that Russell &quot;essentially&quot; directed the film, but stopped short of saying that Russell did the actual directing. Biehn stated that Russell never directed him personally.

Cosmatos was highly focused on accurate historical detail, including the costumes, props, customs, and scenery, to give them authenticity. All the mustaches in the movie were real except Jon Tenney&#x27;s (Sheriff Behan) who had to be clean shaven for his prior project, and was thus the only fake mustache in the movie. Val Kilmer practiced for a long time on his quick-draw speed and gave his character a genteel Southern accent. Two locations were used to make the town of Tombstone look bigger. The scene in which Wyatt throws an abusive card dealer (Billy Bob Thornton) out of a saloon was to show that Wyatt was a man who used psychology to intimidate. Thornton&#x27;s lines in the scene were ad-libbed, as he was only told to &quot;be a bully&quot;.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for &quot;Tombstone&quot; was originally released by Intrada Records on December 25, 1993. On March 16, 2006, an expanded two-disc version of the film score was also released by Intrada Records. The score was composed and produced by Bruce Broughton, and performed by the Sinfonia of London. David Snell conducted most of the score (although Broughton normally conducts his own scores, union problems mandated another conductor here), while Patricia Carlin edited the film&#x27;s music.

The score contains strong echoes of Max Steiner&#x27;s music for John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956) with variations on the &#x27;Indian Traders&#x27; theme used midway through the Ford movie. The album begins with the Cinergi logo, composed by Jerry Goldsmith and conducted by Broughton.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Tombstone&quot; premiered in movie theaters six months before Lawrence Kasdan&#x27;s &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, on December 24, 1993, in wide release throughout the United States. During its opening weekend, the film opened in third place at the US box office behind &quot;The Pelican Brief&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, grossing $6,454,752 in business showing at 1,504 locations. The film&#x27;s revenue increased by 35% in its second week of release, earning $8,720,255. For that particular weekend, the film stayed in third place, screening in 1,955 theaters. The film went on to gross $56,505,065 in total ticket sales in the United States and Canada. It ranks 20th out of all films released in 1993. Internationally, it grossed $16.7 million for a worldwide total of $73.2 million.

===Critical response===
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 74% of 47 sampled critics gave &quot;Tombstone&quot; a positive review, with an average score of 6.30/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;If you&#x27;re seeking a stylish modern western with a solid story and a well-chosen ensemble cast, &quot;Tombstone&quot; is your huckleberry.&quot; Following its cinematic release in 1993, &quot;Tombstone&quot; was named &quot;one of the 5 greatest Westerns ever made&quot; by &quot;True West Magazine&quot;. The film was also called &quot;One of the year&#x27;s 10 best!&quot; by KCOP-TV in Los Angeles, California. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; originally thought they would have to miss reviewing the film, as they could not get a screening, but as Ebert explained, &quot;... a strange thing started to happen. People started telling me they really liked Val Kilmer&#x27;s performance in &quot;Tombstone&quot;, and I heard this everywhere I went. When you hear this once or twice, it&#x27;s interesting, when you hear it a couple of dozen times, it&#x27;s a trend. And when you read that Bill Clinton loved the performance, you figured you better catch up with the movie.&quot; Ultimately, Ebert recommended the movie while Siskel did not.

Ebert would later refer to &quot;Tombstone&quot; in future reviews, comparing it favorably to Kevin Costner&#x27;s &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; (&quot;It forced the comparison upon me.&quot;) and, in his review of &quot;Wild Bill&quot;, singling out Val Kilmer&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;the definitive saloon cowboy of our time.&quot; In his review of Kurt Russell&#x27;s &quot;Dark Blue&quot;, he stated, &quot;Every time I see Russell or Val Kilmer in a role, I&#x27;m reminded of their &quot;Tombstone&quot;, which got lost in the year-end holiday shuffle and never got the recognition it deserved.&quot;
In a mixed review, Chris Hicks writing in the &quot;Deseret News&quot; said, &quot;aside from Russell and Val Kilmer&#x27;s scene-stealing, sickly, alcoholic Doc Holliday, there are so many characters coming and going, with none of them receiving adequate screen time, that it becomes difficult to keep track of them all.&quot; He commented, &quot;some very entertaining moments here, with Russell spouting memorable tough-guy lines&quot;. Overall, he felt, &quot;Taken on its own terms, with some lowered expectations, Western fans will have fun.&quot; Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; believed the film was a &quot;tough-talking but soft-hearted tale&quot; which was &quot;entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.&quot; Regarding screenwriter Jarre&#x27;s dialogue, he noted, &quot;Despite the lack of emotional center and narrative focus, his script contains enough subplots and colorful characters to enliven the film and ultimately make it a fun, if not totally engaging experience.&quot; He also singled out Val Kilmer as the standout performance. The film was not without its detractors. James Berardinelli writing for ReelViews offered a negative review, recalling how he thought, &quot;The first half of &quot;Tombstone&quot; isn&#x27;t an example of great filmmaking, but it is engaging. There&#x27;s a sense of growing inevitability as events build to the shoot-out at the OK Corral. The melodramatic &quot;serious&quot; moments are kept to a minimum, and the various gunfights are choreographed with style and tension. Then, at the one-hour ten-minute mark, the Clanton gang and the Earps square off. From there, things get progressively worse. Not only is the last hour anticlimactic, but it&#x27;s dull. Too many scenes feature lengthy segments of poorly-scripted dialogue, and, in some cases, character motivation becomes unclear. The gunplay is more repetitious than exciting. The result—a cobbled-together morass of silly lines and shoot-outs—doesn&#x27;t work well.&quot;

Stephen Holden writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw the film as being a &quot;capacious Western with many modern touches, the Arizona boom town and site of the legendary O.K. Corral has a seedy, vaudevillian grandeur that makes it a direct forerunner of Las Vegas.&quot; He expressed his satisfaction with the supporting acting, saying, &quot;[the] most modern psychological touch is its depiction of Josephine (Dana Delany), the itinerant actress with whom Wyatt falls in love at first sight, as the most casually and comfortably liberated woman ever to set foot in 1880s Arizona.&quot; Critic Louis Black, writing for &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, viewed &quot;Tombstone&quot; as a &quot;mess&quot; and that there were &quot;two or three pre-climaxes but no climax. Its values are capitalist rather than renegade, which is okay if it&#x27;s metaphoric rather than literal. Worse, as much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C− rating, calling it &quot;preposterously inflated&quot; at &quot;135 minutes long&quot;. He observed the film as being a &quot;three-hour rough cut that&#x27;s been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut&quot; with &quot;all that holds the film together is Kurt Russell&#x27;s droll machismo.&quot; Author Geoff Andrew of &quot;Time Out&quot; commented, &quot;Kilmer makes a surprisingly effective and effete Holliday&quot;. He negatively acknowledged that there was &quot;a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls&quot; but ultimately exclaimed the film was &quot;&#x27;rootin&#x27;, tootin&#x27; entertainment with lots of authentic facial hair.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; highlighted the film&#x27;s shortcomings declaring, &quot;too much of &quot;Tombstone&quot; rings hollow. In retrospect, not much happens and little that does seems warranted. There are so many unrealized relationships you almost hope for redemption in a longer video version. This one is unsatisfying and unfulfilling.&quot; Alternately though, columnist Bob Bloom of the &quot;Journal &amp; Courier&quot; openly remarked that the film &quot;May not be historically accurate, but offers a lot of punch for the buck.&quot; He concluded by saying it was &quot;A tough, guilty-pleasure Western.&quot;
Although Val Kilmer&#x27;s performance as Doc Holliday was praised, he did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He was nominated for Best Male Performance and Most Desirable Male at the MTV Movie Awards.

==Books==
A paperback novel of the same name adapted from Kevin Jarre&#x27;s screenplay, written by Giles Tippette and published by Berkley Publishers, was released on January 1, 1994. The book dramatizes the real-life events of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Earp Vendetta Ride, as depicted in the film. It expands on Western genre ideas in Jarre&#x27;s screenplay.

&quot;The Making of Tombstone&quot;, a book about the film, was published in 2018.

<text>Robert Chester Wilson Ettinger (; December 4, 1918 – July 23, 2011) was an American academic, known as &quot;the father of cryonics&quot; because of the impact of his 1962 book &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot;.

Ettinger founded the Cryonics Institute and the related Immortalist Society and until 2003 served as the groups&#x27; president. His body has been cryopreserved, like the bodies of his first and second wives, and his mother.

==Personal background==
Ettinger was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants. Raised Jewish, he later attended Protestant Unitarian church services before becoming an atheist. He served as a second lieutenant infantryman in the United States Army during World War II. Severely wounded in battle in Germany, he received the Purple Heart and recovered after several years spent in a Michigan hospital. He earned two master&#x27;s degrees from Wayne State University (one in physics, one in mathematics) and spent his working career teaching physics and mathematics at both Wayne State University and Highland Park Community college in Michigan.

Ettinger had two children with his first wife, Elaine, David (1951) and Shelley (1954). David gave his first cryonics interview to journalists at the age of 12 and was an attorney. He served as legal counsel to the Cryonics Institute and the Immortalist Society. Robert Ettinger&#x27;s daughter, who has had no interest in cryonics, is a writer and revolutionary socialist.

Ettinger met his second wife, Mae Junod, in 1962 when she attended one of his adult education courses in basic physics. Junod typed and assisted with editing the manuscripts for both &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot; and &quot;Man Into Superman&quot;. She became active in the Cryonics Society of Michigan (CSM) and edited and was a production manager for the CSM monthly newsletter, &quot;The Outlook&quot;. In the 1970s &quot;The Outlook&quot; was renamed &quot;The Immortalist&quot; and Junod continued editorship until the mid-1990s. &quot;The Outlook&quot; is the longest continuously published cryonics magazine. Junod was an author, feminist, and marriage counselor.

Ettinger married Junod in 1988 after the death of his first wife. Ettinger described his time with Junod as one of the most satisfying and tranquil times in his life. The couple moved to Scottsdale, Arizona in 1995 and enjoyed a period of domestic life during which time the couple began to ease into retirement from over 30 years of cryonics activism and the attendant burdens of work and controversy. Mae Ettinger suffered a debilitating stroke in 1998 from which she never fully recovered followed by a lethal stroke in 2000, which resulted in her cryopreservation.

Ettinger died on July 23, 2011, at the age of 92, in Detroit, Michigan of natural causes, and was cryopreserved with the hope of future revival.

==Roots of cryonics in science fiction==
Ettinger grew up reading Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Ettinger was particularly affected when he was 12 years old by a Neil R. Jones story, &quot;The Jameson Satellite,&quot; which appeared in the July 1931 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, in which one Professor Jameson had his corpse sent into earth orbit where (as the author mistakenly thought) it would remain preserved indefinitely at near absolute zero. And so it did, in the story, until millions of years later, when, with humanity extinct, a race of mechanical men with organic brains chanced upon it. They revived and repaired Jameson&#x27;s brain, installed it in a mechanical body, and he became one of their company.

Ettinger assumed that one day — long before he grew old — biologists would learn the secret of eternal youth. As he grew out of boyhood in the 1930s, he began to suspect it might take a little longer since no scientists were yet working on this particular endeavor. If immortality is achievable through the ministrations of technologically advanced aliens repairing a frozen human corpse, then Ettinger thought everyone could be cryopreserved to await later rescue by our own medically more sophisticated descendants.

In 1948, Ettinger&#x27;s short story &quot;The Penultimate Trump&quot; was published in &quot;Startling Stories&quot;. The story sets out the development of a method of putting people into &quot;suspended animation&quot; until medical science can restore their health, and the changes found by the first of those when he is revived.

==Launching the cryonics movement==
Ettinger waited expectantly for prominent scientists or physicians to come to the same conclusion he had, and to take a position of public advocacy. By 1960, Ettinger finally made the scientific case for the idea, which had always been in the back of his mind. Ettinger was 42 years old and said he was increasingly aware of his own mortality. In what has been characterized as an historically important mid-life crisis, Ettinger summarized the idea of cryonics in a few pages, with the emphasis on life insurance, and sent this to approximately 200 people whom he selected from &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in America&quot;. The response was very small, and it was clear that a much longer exposition was needed — mostly to counter cultural bias. Ettinger correctly saw that people, even the intellectually, financially and socially distinguished, would have to be educated into understanding his belief that dying is usually gradual and could be a reversible process, and that freezing damage is so limited (even though fatal by present criteria) that its reversibility demands relatively little in future progress. Ettinger soon made an even more troubling discovery, principally that &quot;a great many people have to be coaxed into admitting that life is better than death, healthy is better than sick, smart is better than stupid, and immortality might be worth the trouble!&quot;

In 1962, Ettinger privately published a preliminary version of &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot;, in which he said that future technological advances could be used to bring people back to life. This finally attracted attention of a major publisher, which sent a copy to Isaac Asimov; Asimov said that the science behind cryonics was sound, and the manuscript was approved for a 1964 Doubleday hardcover and various subsequent editions which launched cryonics. The book became a selection of the Book of the Month Club and was published in nine languages.

Ettinger became an &quot;overnight&quot; media celebrity, discussed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, &quot;Christian Century&quot;, and dozens of other periodicals. He appeared on television with David Frost, Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, and others. Ettinger also spoke on radio programs coast-to-coast to promote the idea of human cryopreservation.

Since the commercial publication of &quot;The Prospect of Immortality&quot;, all those active in cryonics today can trace their involvement, directly or indirectly, to the publication of one or both of Ettinger&#x27;s books. While Ettinger was the first, most articulate, and most scientifically credible person to argue the idea of cryonics, he was not the only one. In 1962, Evan Cooper had authored a manuscript entitled &quot;Immortality: Physically, Scientifically, Now&quot; under the pseudonym Nathan Duhring. Cooper&#x27;s book contained the same argument as did Ettinger&#x27;s, but it lacked both scientific and technical rigor and was not of publication quality.

<doc id="525132" wikidata="Q994007" url="?curid=525132" title="Fairey Firefly">
<text>The Fairey Firefly is a Second World War-era carrier-borne fighter aircraft and anti-submarine aircraft that was principally operated by the Fleet Air Arm (FAA). It was developed and built by the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation Company.

Development of the Firefly can be traced back to pair of specifications issued by the British Air Ministry in 1938, calling for new naval fighter designs. Designed to the contemporary FAA concept of a two-seat fleet reconnaissance/fighter, the pilot and observer were positioned at separate stations. In flight, the Firefly was superior in terms of both performance and firepower to its predecessor, the Fairey Fulmar. Due to a protracted development, the type only entered operational service towards the end of the conflict, at which point it was no longer competitive as a fighter. The limitations of a single engine in a relatively heavy airframe reduced its performance, but the Firefly proved to be a fairly sturdy, long-ranged, and docile aircraft during carrier operations.

The Fairey Firefly served in the Second World War as a fleet fighter. During the post-war era, it was soon superseded in the fighter role by the arrival of more modern jet aircraft, thus the Firefly was adapted to perform in other roles, including strike operations and anti-submarine warfare. In these capacities, it remained a mainstay of the FAA until the mid-1950s. Both British and Australian Fireflies routinely performed ground–attack operations from various aircraft carriers during the Korean War. In foreign service, the type was in operation with the naval air arms of Australia, Canada, India and the Netherlands. As late as 1962, Dutch Fireflies were used to carry out attack sorties against Indonesian infiltrators in Dutch New Guinea. Its final uses were in various secondary roles, such as trainers, target tugs and drone aircraft.

==Design and development==
During 1938, by which point British authorities were preparing for the likelihood of a great war, the Air Ministry issued a pair of specifications calling for naval fighters, a conventional and a &quot;turret fighter&quot;. The performance requirements for both was to be able to attain a speed of while flying at and carrying an armament, for the conventional fighter, of eight Browning machine guns or four Hispano cannon. This aircraft would replace the Fairey Fulmar, which had been viewed as an interim design. These specifications were updated during the following year, while several British manufacturers tendered their ideas. Further changes to the official specification followed, such as the turret fighter specification being eliminated, while a modified specification was issued to cover single and dual-seat fighters capable of respectively. Fairey offered designs that could accommodate either a single or twin-seat arrangements, either powered by the Rolls-Royce Griffon engine, or combining a larger airframe with a Napier Sabre engine. After consideration of the manufacturer&#x27;s responses, Specification N.5/40 replaced the earlier specifications. Due to the necessity of navigating over open sea, it was decided to opt for a two-seater aircraft alone. For defence of naval bases, a separate single seater design would lead to the Blackburn Firebrand.

The Firefly was designed by a team led by H.E. Chaplin at Fairey Aviation which reportedly used the Fulmar as a starting point. During June 1940, the Admiralty placed an initial order for 200 aircraft &quot;off the drawing board&quot;, the first three of which were to function as prototypes. On 22 December 1941, the first prototype of the Firefly performed its maiden flight. Although the aircraft was heavier than the preceding Fulmar (largely due to the adoption of the heavier Griffon engine and the armament of two Hispano cannon in each wing), the Firefly was faster due to improved aerodynamics, as well as the increased power of the Griffon IIB engine, being capable of generating a maximum of .

The Firefly was a low-wing cantilever monoplane, featuring an oval-section metal semi-monocoque fuselage and a conventional tail unit with forward-placed tailplane. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce Griffon liquid-cooled piston engine, which drove a four-blade Rotol-built propeller. A large chin-mounted radiator was present to provide cooling for the engine. The Firefly had retractable main undercarriage and tail wheel, the hydraulically-actuated main landing gear retracting inwards into the underside of the wing centre-section. This undercarriage was widely-set, a highly useful feature for carrier landings. The aircraft was also fitted with a retractable arrester hook mounted underneath the rear fuselage. The pilot&#x27;s cockpit was located above the leading edge of the wing while the observer/radio-operator/navigator was positioned aft of the wing&#x27;s trailing edge. These positions provided better visibility for operating and landing, and both crew were provided with separate jettisonable canopies.

The Firefly was equipped with an all-metal wing which could be folded manually, the wings ending up along the sides of the fuselage when folded. When in the flying position, the wings were hydraulically locked in place. The wing itself featured square tips and large Fairey-Youngman flaps, which provided relatively good handling while flown at low speeds. A total of four 20mm cannon were buried within the wings, which was considered to be relatively heavy armament for the era. According to pilots, the general handling of the Firefly was relatively well-balanced, but a level of physical strength was required to effectively execute aerobatics.

During 1942, handling and performance trials were first undertaken at RAF Boscombe Down by Admiralty test pilots Mike Lithgow and Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner. By 1944, the Firefly had been cleared to use underwing rocket projectiles and, by April 1944, tests involving a double-underwing load of 16 rockets and a pair of drop tanks still provided acceptable handling. Further testing with two 90 gallon (410 L) drop tanks or two bombs deemed acceptable albeit with &quot;...a small adverse effect on handling...&quot; while &quot;...handling with a single bomb was unpleasant, but manageable.&quot; Performance trials at indicated a maximum speed of at while a climb to took 12.4 minutes, with a maximum climb rate of at , and a service ceiling of .

==Operational history==
The primary variant of the aircraft used during the Second World War was the Firefly Mk I, which was used in all theatres of operations. During March 1943, the first Firefly Mk Is were delivered to the FAA but these did not enter operational service until July 1944, at which point they equipped 1770 Naval Air Squadron aboard . The first operations were flown in the European theatre where Fireflies carried out numerous armed reconnaissance flights and anti-shipping strikes along the Norwegian coast. That year, Fireflies also provided air cover and aerial reconnaissance during attacks on the German battleship .

Throughout its operational career, the Firefly took on increasingly demanding roles from fighter to anti-submarine warfare while being stationed mainly with the British Pacific Fleet in the Far East and Pacific theatres. The type was used against Japanese ground targets and fighter aircraft. FAA Fireflies carried out attacks on oil refineries and airfields and was repeatedly dispatched against Japanese-controlled islands up until Victory over Japan Day. The Firefly gained a level of public renown when the type became the first British-designed and -built aircraft to overfly the Japanese capital of Tokyo.

During May 1945, in anticipation of a major naval offensive against the Japanese mainland, the Canadian government accepted a British offer to loan a pair of &quot;Colossus&quot;-class aircraft carriers to the Royal Canadian Navy. To equip these carriers, it was necessary to procure naval fighters. Based upon the feedback of veteran pilots, Canada opted to acquire the Firefly over opposition that favoured procuring American aircraft instead. As a stop-gap measure, Royal Navy Fireflies were loaned while more advanced purpose-built aircraft were being constructed. Between 1946 and 1954, the Canadian Navy employed 65 AS Mk.5 Fireflies on its aircraft carriers. The service also flew a handful of Mk.I Fireflies. During the 1950s, Canada decided to sell off its Fireflies and buyers included the armed forces of Ethiopia, Denmark, and the Netherlands.

After the Second World War, the Firefly remained in front line service with the Fleet Air Arm, continuing in this capacity until the mid-1950s. During this time, British-built Fireflies were also supplied to a number of overseas nations, including Canada, Australia, Denmark, Ethiopia, the Netherlands, India and Thailand.
During 1947, the Australian government approved of formation of the Royal Australian Fleet Air Arm and the acquisition of a pair of s from Britain. Following a consultation with the Royal Navy, the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) opted to procure both the Firefly and the Hawker Sea Fury to equip its new aircraft carriers. These two types formed the backbone of the newly formed Australian Carrier Air Groups (CAGs), which would operate a total fleet size of 108 Fireflies, acquired across multiple orders. The first aircraft was delivered in May 1949, and the final Firefly arrived during August 1953. aircrew training predominated in early RAN operations ahead of achieving operational status during 1950.

During the Korean War of the 1950s, both British and Australian Fireflies carried out anti-shipping patrols and ground strikes from various aircraft carriers positioned offshore. Additional missions roles including anti-submarine patrols and aerial observation, as well as assisting battleships in providing effective naval gunfire support. Numerous FAA Fireflies were loaned to the Australian Navy during the conflict as many of its aircraft did not feature cannons when configured for anti-submarine warfare. Despite several incidents of aircraft being struck by anti-aircraft fire, the Firefly proved to be relatively rugged. The type was routinely used for strike operations against targets such as bridges and railway lines to damage North Korean logistics and communications. As the war went on, pilots developed new low-level dive-bombing techniques to achieve greater accuracy. Combat use of the Firefly in the theatre continued until the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953, although post-armistice patrols involving the type continued for several years afterwards.
FAA Fireflies were again deployed in the Far East amid the Malayan Emergency, where it was used to conduct ground-attack operations against Malayan Communist Party insurgents. The Firefly&#x27;s front line career with the FAA came to an end shortly following the introduction of the newer and larger Fairey Gannet, which effectively replaced the type. The RAN also decided to relegate their Fireflies to secondary duties following the adoption of newer aircraft, such as the Gannet and the jet-powered de Havilland Sea Venom. Several versions of the type were developed later in its career to serve in a number of secondary roles, including as trainers, target tugs and drone aircraft. As an example, the Indian Navy acquired a batch of 10 aircraft during the mid-1950s for target tug purposes. By the end of the 1950s, many operators were disposing of their remaining Fireflies, typically as scrap.

In the late 1940s, the Royal Netherlands Navy deployed a Firefly squadron to the Dutch East Indies, as part of the forces countering Indonesian nationalists. When talks broke down in July 1947, the Dutch launched multiple air strikes. Three Fireflies were shot down by ground fire. During 1960, in response to territorial demands and threats issued by Indonesia, the Netherlands chose to deploy a number of Firefly AS.Mk 4s to Dutch New Guinea. As Indonesian forces began to retake the territory, the Fireflies carried out attack operations during early 1962. These strikes continued until the Royal Netherlands Navy withdrew following the negotiation of a political settlement between the two countries.

==Surviving aircraft==

There are approximately 24 Fairey Fireflies surviving worldwide, including three airworthy examples and at least one other being restored to flying condition. The Fleet Air Arm Museum holds VH127, a TT4, which is on public display at Yeovilton.

The Imperial War Museum owns one of the oldest surviving Fireflies, serial number Z2033. Built as a MkI in 1944, Z2033 was used originally used by the RNAS for aircraft landing trials, then by Fairey for spin trials. Z2033 was converted to target tug designation and operated in Sweden in the 1950s in this role. The aircraft returned to the UK in 1964 to go on display at the Skyframe Aircraft Museum, and was acquired by Imperial War Museum in 1979. The museum returned Z2033 to its original MkI configuration, and repainted the aircraft as &#x27;DK431&#x27; of 1771 Naval Air Squadron, as operated in the Pacific in July 1945. Z2033 was loaned to the Fleet Air Arm Museum for display between 2000 and August 2023, but the aircraft is now on display again at Imperial War Museum Duxford. 

Firefly &quot;WB271&quot; was destroyed in July 2003 during an aerobatic air display at the Imperial War Museum in Duxford, Cambridgeshire – Europe&#x27;s largest display of vintage warplanes. There are two airworthy Fireflies at present:
* AS 6 &quot;WH632&quot;, which was damaged in a crash and has since been restored to flying condition (painted as an RCN Firefly AS 5), is at the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum (Canada).
* AS 6 &quot;WB518&quot;, another former RAN machine, now in the USA. (Damaged at the Wings Over Gillespie Airshow in June 2012, with restoration to airworthiness completed).
&quot;WB518&quot; was one of the first 10 Mk 6s built, but retained the earlier Mk 5 fuselage. It was originally delivered to the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s 817 Squadron and then served in 816 Squadron before being retired and ending up as a memorial on a pole in Griffith, New South Wales, Australia. &quot;WB518&quot; was then purchased by American Eddie Kurdziel, a Northwest Airlines captain and former U.S. Navy pilot. &quot;WD518&quot; was extensively restored and made its first public appearance at Oshkosh in 2002. Restoration of &quot;WD518&quot; used parts salvaged from &quot;WD828&quot; which was written off after a crash into a cabbage field in Camden, New South Wales in 1987.WB518 as of July 2015 was then undergoing extensive rebuilding and is now in flying condition out of Gillespie Field, El Cajon, California.

Other survivors include – in Australia:
* AS 5 &quot;VX388&quot; is owned by the currently closed to public access Camden Museum of Aviation at Harrington Park, New South Wales.
* AS 6 &quot;WD826&quot; is displayed at the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm Museum (Australia). This Firefly was restored to airworthy condition in the 1980s and flew for three years before its return to the museum.
* AS 6 &quot;WD827&quot; which was once owned by the Australian Air League, Blacktown, New South Wales, is now on display in the Australian National Aviation Museum, Melbourne, Victoria.
* AS 6 &quot;WD828&quot; is displayed on a pole outside the Returned Services Leagues Club in Griffith, Australia. It has been repainted as &quot;WB518&quot; which was the original aircraft displayed in Griffith but is now the flying example restored by Captain Kurdziel. The swap was made in 1991.
* AS 6 &quot;WJ109&quot; is stored for eventual exhibition at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. This aircraft was previously at the Fleet Air Arm Museum (Australia), Nowra, New South Wales.

The Royal Thai Air Force Museum in Bangkok, Thailand has a Firefly Mk I on display.

A sole remaining Firefly of the 10 acquired by India is displayed at the Naval Aviation Museum in Goa.

Two ex-Swedish Fireflies moved to IWM Duxford, Cambridgeshire in 2003. Acquired by the Aircraft Restoration Company, they were in Royal Navy service from 1944 and 1946, and then converted to target tugs for gunnery training in 1950 and 1954. One is being restored to flying condition, and the other was traded to the Aviodrome Museum in the Netherlands for a Spitfire.

As well as the Canadian Warplane Heritage&#x27;s ex-Australian Firefly, two other Fireflies are known to exist in Canada: one is at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa and another is being restored at the Shearwater Aviation Museum at Eastern Passage (near Dartmouth), Nova Scotia. Both are Mk I models that served in the Canadian Navy from 1946 to 1954, after which they were sold to the Ethiopian Air Force. Following their discovery in the Ethiopian desert in 1993, they were repatriated to Canada in exchange for medical supplies.

AS 6 &quot;WD833&quot;, another ex-Australian Firefly, is owned by Henry &quot;Butch&quot; Schroeder who moved the aircraft to Danville, Illinois, USA for restoration. The present whereabouts of this aircraft are unclear.

<text>Jürgen Klinsmann (; born 30 July 1964) is a German professional football manager and former player. He played for several prominent clubs in Europe including VfB Stuttgart, Inter Milan, Monaco, Tottenham Hotspur, and Bayern Munich. He was part of the West German team that won the 1990 FIFA World Cup and the unified German team that won the UEFA Euro 1996. 

As a manager, Klinsmann managed the German national team to a third-place finish at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and was subsequently coach of a number of other teams including, notably Bundesliga club Bayern Munich and the United States national team.

Considered one of Germany&#x27;s premier strikers during the 1990s, Klinsmann scored in all six major international tournaments he participated in for Germany, from the UEFA Euro 1988 to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 1995, he came in third in the FIFA World Player of the Year award; in March 2004 he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the &quot;125 Greatest Living Footballers&quot;. In 2016, he became the fifth player to be named as honorary captain of Germany.

==Club career==
===1972–1981: Youth career===
Klinsmann is one of four sons of master baker Siegfried Klinsmann (died 2005) and his wife Martha (died 2021). At age eight, he began playing for TB Gingen, an amateur football club in Gingen an der Fils. Six months later, he scored 16 goals in a single match for his new club. At age ten, he moved to SC Geislingen. When he was 14 years old, his father bought a bakery in Stuttgart, the state capital. After the family relocated there, Klinsmann continued to play for SC Geislingen, even after he was spotted in a Württemberg youth selection. In 1978, aged 14, he signed a contract with Stuttgarter Kickers, the club where he would turn professional two years later. His parents decided he should first finish his apprenticeship as a baker in their family business, which he completed in 1982.

===1981–1989: Stuttgarter Kickers and VfB Stuttgart===

Klinsmann began his professional career in 1982 at the then-second division side Stuttgarter Kickers. By 1982–83, he was already a regular starter and by the end of the 1983–84 season, he had scored 19 goals for the club. Horst Buhtz, a Stuttgarter Kickers former coach, recalls Klinsmann benefited from intensive training from Horst Allman, who was one of the best sprint coaches in Germany at that time. At the beginning of the new season, he managed to improve his 100 m dash from 11.7 to 11.0 seconds.

In 1984, Klinsmann moved to first division rivals VfB Stuttgart. In his first season at the club, he scored 15 goals and was the team&#x27;s joint top scorer with Karl Allgöwer. Despite his goal scoring efforts, he could not prevent his new club from finishing tenth in the league. During each of the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons, he scored 16 goals and reached the 1986 final of the DFB-Pokal, losing against Bayern Munich 2–5, but scoring the last goal of the match. In the 1987–88 season, he scored 19 goals – including a legendary overhead kick against Bayern – and was the Bundesliga&#x27;s top goalscorer.

In 1988, the 24-year-old Klinsmann was named German Footballer of the Year. After reaching the 1988–89 UEFA Cup final with Stuttgart (eventually losing to Diego Maradona&#x27;s inspired Napoli 5–4 on aggregate), Klinsmann moved to Italian club Inter Milan on a three-year contract, joining two other German internationals, Lothar Matthäus and Andreas Brehme.

===1989–1992: Inter Milan===
In spite of the heavily defensive orientated tactics of head coach Giovanni Trapattoni, Klinsmann scored 13 goals as the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; finished third in Serie A. He became one of the most popular foreign players in Italy, mostly because he had learnt Italian and earned himself the respect of the fans with his appearance and language skills.

During the next season, Klinsmann won the UEFA Cup with Inter (2–1 on aggregate against Roma) and repeated his previous performance in the league with 14 goals; his contract was extended until 1994. A disastrous 1991–92 season caused all plans to fall through. Inter never managed to gain any momentum under coach Corrado Orrico and finished eighth in the league, with Klinsmann only scoring seven goals and the team being divided and fragmented into groups. It was clear for Klinsmann this would be his last season at the San Siro.

===1992–1994: AS Monaco===
After UEFA Euro 1992, Klinsmann moved to Monaco and catapulted the club to a second-place finish in the league in his first season. After the bribery scandal by Marseille and their subsequent disqualification as league winners, Monaco replaced them in the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League, reaching the semi-final before finally losing to eventual winners Milan. The following season, Monaco only managed a ninth-place finish in the league. Klinsmann, who had missed two months due to a torn ligament, was mostly deployed as a lone-striker and started criticizing the attitude of his teammates. In 1994, he left the club early, with one more year remaining on his contract.

===1994–1995: Tottenham Hotspur===
Klinsmann moved to Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League for the 1994–95 season, where the fans and media were very critical of the German because of his reputation as a diver. He was signed by Spurs in July 1994 from Monaco for £2 million. On his debut against Sheffield Wednesday, he scored the winning header and immediately won over fans with his goal celebration by self-deprecatingly diving to the ground. A &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist who had written an article called &quot;Why I Hate Jürgen Klinsmann&quot;, wrote another two months later called &quot;Why I Love Jürgen Klinsmann&quot;. Klinsmann went on to win the 1995 Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year.

Because of his humour, but also because of his athletic achievements and his combative playing style, Klinsmann quickly became extremely popular in England; over 150,000 of his shirts were sold. He now holds legendary status at Spurs and was inducted into Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.

Klinsmann scored 21 goals in the 1994–95 season for Spurs and a total of 30 in all competitions, including a late winner against Liverpool in the quarter-final of the FA Cup. He also found the net in the semi-final, but Spurs missed out on a place in the final by losing 4–1 to Everton.

===1995–2003: Final years===
Klinsmann then had a successful spell at Bayern Munich during the 1995–96 and 1996–97 season. He was the club&#x27;s top goalscorer during both seasons, and won the 1995–96 UEFA Cup, setting a new goalscoring record of 15 goals in 12 matches during the competition (a record that stood until 2011). A year later, he also became German champion as he won the Bundesliga.

He then briefly moved to Italy for Sampdoria, but left the team in the winter and returned to Tottenham Hotspur. During his second stint at Tottenham in the 1997–98 season, his goals saved the club from relegation, particularly the four goals he scored in a 6–2 win at Wimbledon. He played the last match of his high-level club career in 1998 on the final day of the Premier League against Southampton.

After retiring and moving to the United States, in 2003 Klinsmann played for Orange County Blue Star, an amateur team in the fourth-tier Premier Development League.

==International career==

On 12 December 1987, Klinsmann debuted for the West German senior squad in a 1–1 friendly draw against Brazil. He was an important part of the West German team that won the 1990 FIFA World Cup. After qualifying for the round of 16, Germany was to play the Netherlands, against whom they had lost two years earlier at UEFA Euro 1988. After Rudi Völler was sent off in the 22nd minute, Klinsmann was forced to play as a lone striker. He scored the 1–0 opener and his performance received considerable praise. German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; wrote that &quot;In the last decade, not a single forward of a DFB team has offered such a brilliant, almost perfect performance.&quot; After further victories over Czechoslovakia (1–0) and England (1–1 after extra time, 4–3 on penalties), he became a world champion after beating Argentina 1–0 in the final. Klinsmann is remembered for being fouled by the Argentinian Pedro Monzón, who was subsequently sent off, reducing Argentina to ten men. Many critics called the incident a prime example of Klinsmann&#x27;s diving, a claim he contradicted. In a 2004 interview, he noted that the foul left a 15 cm gash on his shin.

==Coaching career==
===Germany===
On 26 July 2004, Klinsmann returned to Germany as the new head coach of the national team, succeeding former teammate and strike partner Rudi Völler. Klinsmann subsequently embarked on an aggressive program to revamp the management of the team. Bringing fellow German striker Oliver Bierhoff on board helped diffuse public relations duties of the previous combined post away from the actual coaching aspect of the position. Furthermore, he created a youth movement to breathe life into an aging squad on the heels of a disastrous showing at Euro 2004. In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, Klinsmann attracted criticism from German fans and the media following poor results, such as the 4–1 loss to Italy. A particular subject of criticism was that Klinsmann commuted to Germany from the U.S., which was the target of a campaign by the tabloid &quot;Bild&quot;. Klinsmann previously eliminated some privileges &quot;Bild&quot; traditionally had with the national team, such as receiving the team lineup the day before a match and 24/7 exclusive access to the team. His largely offensive tactics have irritated some, who complained he ignored defensive football. He announced a squad of young players for the 2006 World Cup, basing his selection policy on performance, not reputation.

During the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup, he regularly rotated his goalkeepers regardless of their performances, which drew the ire of Bayern Munich&#x27;s Oliver Kahn. On 7 April 2006, Klinsmann finally decided to relegate Kahn to the bench and designated Arsenal&#x27;s Jens Lehmann as his first choice goalkeeper. This choice followed Lehmann&#x27;s performances in the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League in which his Arsenal team bowed out in the final against Barcelona.

In the 2006 World Cup, Germany&#x27;s performances silenced Klinsmann&#x27;s critics, which included the form of an English song: &quot;Who Do You Think You Are Kidding Jurgen Klinsmann?&quot; The team recorded three-straight wins against Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador in the group stage, earning Germany first place in Group A. The first match of the knockout stage was a 2–0 victory over Sweden, and in the quarter-finals, Klinsmann&#x27;s team defeated Argentina, winning 4–2 on penalties. The teams drew 1–1 after 120 minutes after an equalising goal from Miroslav Klose in the 80th minute.

In the semi-final on 4 July, Germany lost a close match with Italy 2–0 after goals in the final minutes of extra time from Fabio Grosso and Alessandro Del Piero. After the match, Klinsmann praised the performance of his young team. They beat Portugal 3–1 in the third place play-off, where he played Kahn instead of Jens Lehmann. The victory triggered a massive parade in Berlin the following day where Klinsmann and the team were honoured by the public.

Afterward, Franz Beckenbauer, previously a strident critic of Klinsmann&#x27;s, declared his desire to see Klinsmann continue as coach. There was also widespread public support for Klinsmann due to his team&#x27;s spirit and attacking style of play. The team&#x27;s strong performance is thought by some to have renewed national pride and restored Germany&#x27;s reputation as a top soccer nation. Due to his success coaching the national team, Klinsmann was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz.

Despite the highly acclaimed performance at the World Cup and the praise earned, Klinsmann declined to renew his contract, informing the German Football Association (DFB) of his decision on 11 July 2006. The decision was officially announced by the DFB on 12 July 2006. Klinsmann&#x27;s assistant, Joachim Löw, was appointed as the new head coach at the same press conference. Klinsmann said, &quot;My big wish is to go back to my family, to go back to leading a normal life with them... After two years of putting in a lot of energy, I feel I lack the power and the strength to continue in the same way.&quot;

===Bayern Munich===
In January 2008, it was announced that Klinsmann would become Bayern Munich coach in July, succeeding Ottmar Hitzfeld. After beginning his role, Klinsmann made large changes to the club&#x27;s training ground and structure in an attempt to modernise the club&#x27;s culture. Notably, he installed Buddha statues in the training ground, which were criticised in the media and quickly removed.

Bayern started the season poorly and Klinsmann came under pressure as early as September, after a 5-2 home loss to Werder Bremen. After a 3-3 draw with VfL Bochum in October, Bayern were in 11th place in the Bundesliga and some fans chanted that Klinsmann should be sacked.

Bayern reached the quarter-final of the Champions League, after beating Sporting CP 12-1 on aggregate in the first knockout round, a Champions League record. However, they would lose heavily to eventual winners FC Barcelona in the next round, losing the first leg 4-0. Franz Beckenbauer described the team&#x27;s performance as &quot;the most dreadful I&#x27;ve ever seen from a Bayern team.&quot; Earlier that week, Bayern had lost 5-1 to Felix Magath&#x27;s VfL Wolfsburg in a crucial league match.

Klinsmann was sacked on 27 April 2009 with five matches remaining. His final match was a 1–0 loss to Schalke 04. Bayern were in third-place at the time of the sacking. Klinsmann finished with a record of 25 wins, nine draws, and 10 losses in all competitions.

Following Klinsmann&#x27;s time with Bayern, Bayern team captain Phillip Lahm wrote in his autobiography that Klinsmann&#x27;s tenure with the club was a &quot;failure&quot; and that Klinsmann&#x27;s lack of tactical instruction required the players to meet before kickoff to discuss strategy. Although they were largely criticised at the time, some of the changes he made at Bayern have since been recognised as helping contribute to the club&#x27;s subsequent success.

===Toronto FC===
In November 2010, Klinsmann was hired as a technical consultant for Major League Soccer (MLS) club Toronto FC to advise on an overhaul of the club&#x27;s coaching and playing personnel, leading the club to hire Aron Winter as head coach and Paul Mariner as technical director the following year. Both Winter and Mariner would later be fired by the club during a last place finish in the 2012 season.

===United States===
On 29 July 2011, Klinsmann was named the 35th head coach of the United States national team, replacing previous manager Bob Bradley, who had been fired following a 4–2 loss to Mexico in the final of the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

The U.S. struggled in friendly games early in Klinsmann&#x27;s tenure, losing four matches and drawing one before ending the 2011 season with a victory over Slovenia. On 29 February 2012, the U.S. national team recorded a historic 1–0 victory in a friendly match away against Italy, its first win against the four-time World Cup champions. On 15 August 2012, Klinsmann coached the U.S. to a historic 1–0 win against long time rivals Mexico in a friendly held at the Estadio Azteca, giving the U.S. its first victory in the stadium.

In 2013, Klinsmann led the U.S. team into the final round of qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, beginning with a 2–1 loss at Honduras before earning a point with a scoreless draw against Mexico in the Azteca. On 2 June 2013, the United States played their centennial celebratory game against Germany, where Klinsmann coached them to a 4–3 win over his native country. On 28 July, Klinsmann coached the U.S. team to their fifth CONCACAF Gold Cup title, defeating Panama 1–0 in the final. On 10 September 2013, following a 2–0 win over Mexico, the United States secured qualification for the World Cup. On 12 December 2013, Klinsmann signed a new contract extension with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF), lasting until 2018.

====2014 World Cup====
Klinsmann surprised the U.S. football world in May 2014 by selecting five so-called &quot;Jurgen Americans&quot;, players with American serviceman fathers and German mothers who had all been born and professionally trained in Germany, to the 23-men squad in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. His selection particularly received criticism when he cut all-time leading U.S. scorer Landon Donovan from the final roster for the 2014 World Cup following the team&#x27;s preliminary training camp. Klinsmann described it as &quot;the most difficult decision of [his] coaching career&quot; but that he sees other players &quot;slightly ahead of [Donovan]&quot;. Klinsmann faced further controversy after his son Jonathan posted a comment on Twitter ridiculing Donovan, causing some to speculate that the decision was influenced by personal animosity between Klinsmann and Donovan.

On 16 June, Klinsmann guided the United States to a 2–1 win over Ghana in their first match of the 2014 World Cup, behind an early strike from captain Clint Dempsey and a dramatic 86th-minute header from substitute John Brooks. On 22 June, his side drew 2–2 against Portugal in the second group match. A defensive miscue early in the game led to an easy Portugal goal, but Jermaine Jones equalized with a strike from 30 yards out in the second half. Then, in the 81st minute, Dempsey scored to give the U.S. a 2–1 lead. The score remained 2–1 until the final seconds of stoppage time where Cristiano Ronaldo sent a cross that was headed past U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard by Silvestre Varela. On 26 June, the U.S. faced Germany. With possible elimination looming again as their round of 16 spot hung in the balance, the U.S. fell to the Germans, 1–0, but the hope of surviving the &quot;group of death&quot; remained alive in the Portugal–Ghana game in which Portugal defeated Ghana, 2–1, sending the U.S. to the round of 16.

The U.S. drew Belgium in the round of 16. After spending much of the match defending against Belgium&#x27;s potent attack, with goalkeeper Tim Howard setting a World Cup finals record for saves in a match, the U.S. survived with a 0–0 score after 90 minutes, sending the match to extra time. After quickly falling behind 2–0 to Belgium in extra time, the U.S. cut the deficit in half in the 107th minute when substitute Julian Green volleyed in a lobbed through ball from Michael Bradley, but were unable to score a second and were eliminated.

====2018 World Cup cycle====
Klinsmann led the U.S. to a 1–0 win over Czech Republic to open the new 2018 World Cup cycle on 3 September, its first win over the Czechs. On 5 June 2015, Klinsmann guided the U.S. to a dramatic 4–3 win over the Netherlands in a friendly in Amsterdam and another friendly victory over Germany five days later.

The U.S. under Klinsmann finished fourth in the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup following losses to Jamaica in the semi-finals and Panama in the third place match, the team&#x27;s worst performance in the tournament since 2000. In 2016, Klinsmann successfully advanced the U.S. through its first round of World Cup qualification out of a group containing Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

The U.S. opened the final World Cup qualification round in November 2016 with a 2–1 home defeat to Mexico and a 4–0 away defeat to Costa Rica. Following the losses, which left the U.S. at the bottom of the qualification table, Klinsmann was fired by the USSF on 21 November 2016, being replaced by LA Galaxy manager Bruce Arena, who had previously coached the team from 1998 to 2006. Ultimately, the U.S. failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

===Hertha BSC===
On 27 November 2019, Klinsmann became the new manager of Hertha BSC, replacing Ante Čović.
On 11 February 2020 he announced via Facebook that he would step down as coach after having been in this position for just ten weeks. Despite stating his intention of remaining part of the club&#x27;s supervisory board, he was ultimately barred from doing so as Hertha&#x27;s investor Lars Windhorst publicly criticized his behavior, calling the manner of his departure &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

===South Korea===
On 27 February 2023, Klinsmann was announced as the head coach of South Korea, replacing Paulo Bento on a contract until the conclusion of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Klinsmann has been described as highly unpopular to South Korean fans, due to his unusual practice of working while away from South Korea, his alleged lack of interest in players in the K League 1, and his questionable squad selections. Following poor performance in South Korea&#x27;s friendly matches, he received heavy criticism. This became increasingly problematic during the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, when South Korea had only a win and two draws at the group stages (3-1 Bahrain), (2-2 Jordan), (3-3 Malaysia), leaving them to face a challenging knockout stage draw against Saudi Arabia. During this match, Klinsmann&#x27;s tactics and player selections were highly criticised. In the end, South Korea lost to Jordan 2–0 in the semifinal on 7 February. Afterwards, Klinsmann&#x27;s tactics and work ethic became the focus of scrutiny from both the South Korean public and the team. On 16 February, the Korea Football Association announced the immediate termination of Klinsmann&#x27;s contract, citing &quot;failure to demonstrate leadership&quot; as one of the reasons.

==Charity work and social engagements==
In 1995, Klinsmann and some of his close friends founded the children charity foundation Agapedia, which stems from the Greek language and translates to &quot;Love for Children&quot;. In 1997, Klinsmann, acting as the captain of the Germany national team, visited the Holocaust memorial place Yad Vashem in Israel alongside his coach Berti Vogts. This visit was televised around the globe and drew worldwide attention. Klinsmann is also a board member of the German Initiative Für die Zukunft lernen, which means &quot;Learning for the future&quot;, and supports the education of young people about the Holocaust. In May 1999, Klinsmann donated all the proceeds from his farewell match (more than US$1 million) to different children&#x27;s charity organizations. The match was a sell-out with 54,000 fans in Stuttgart&#x27;s Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion. Famous personalities such as Bryan Adams, Boris Becker and many others contributed to this event.

==Personal life==
Klinsmann was born in Göppingen. His family moved to Stuttgart when he was a teenager. Klinsmann&#x27;s family operates a bakery in Stuttgart&#x27;s Botnang district and consequently he is sometimes affectionately referred to as the &quot;baker&#x27;s son from Botnang&quot;. Klinsmann is, in fact, a journeyman baker, having served an apprenticeship.

He is married to Debbie Chin (), an American former model of Chinese descent, having proposed to her back in 1995; they wed later that year in Milan.

Klinsmann lives in Huntington Beach, California. He and his wife have two children. Son Jonathan, a goalkeeper, has been capped at age group level for the United States U-20 team. Aside from German, Klinsmann is fluent in English, Italian and French, and is a certified commercial helicopter pilot. He is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Klinsmann has also worked as a pundit, working with ESPN for the 2010 World Cup, and with BBC Sport at the 2018 World Cup and 2020 European Championship. He works on ESPN FC as of 2021. He wrote the daily email newsletter from Qatar for BBC Sport during the World Cup 2022.

On 25 November 2022, following Iran&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Wales in the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Klinsmann received backlash after his controversial comments made on BBC. Klinsmann claimed that the reason Iran won was because they used dirty tactics to manipulate Guatemalan referee Mario Escobar and that it was a part of Iranian football culture to play dirty. He then went on to claim that head coach Carlos Queiroz was a failure during his stint at Colombia and Egypt, stating &quot;This is not by coincidence, this is all [done] purposely ... This is just part of their culture.&quot; Carlos Queiroz responded inviting Klinsmann to the Iran camp to show him what Iranian football culture truly is, and petitioned FIFA to remove him as a member of the Qatar 2022 Technical Study Group.

In April 2023, Klinsmann was one of the 22 personal guests at the ceremony in which former Chancellor Angela Merkel was decorated with the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit for special achievement by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at Schloss Bellevue in Berlin.

<doc id="525143" wikidata="Q7278724" url="?curid=525143" title="Rabies (Skinny Puppy album)">
<text>Rabies is the fifth studio album by Skinny Puppy. It was released on November 21, 1989 through Nettwerk. The album notably features Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen (credited as Alien Jourgensen) who performed electric guitar and vocals on several songs. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Tin Omen&quot; and &quot;Worlock&quot;, the latter of which becoming one of the band&#x27;s most recognizable songs. The cover art was made by longtime Skinny Puppy collaborator Steven R. Gilmore. In 1993 the CD edition was reissued by Nettwerk to correct mastering errors in the original release.

&quot;Rabies&quot; was a commercial success for the band, but received mixed reviews from critics upon release, several of whom drew parallels between the record and Ministry&#x27;s style, both favorably and unfavorably. A joint tour with Ministry, KMFDM, and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, dubbed The Mutants of Rock Tour, was planned but ultimately cancelled when Skinny Puppy ended its commitment to the project.

==Recording and production==
Most of the band&#x27;s previous albums had been mixed and produced by the group&#x27;s &quot;fourth member&quot; Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie. For &quot;Rabies&quot;, lead singer/songwriter Nivek Ogre brought in friend and Ministry frontman, Al Jourgensen. Ogre had met Jourgensen during the recording of the PTP song &quot;Show Me Your Spine&quot; in 1987. Ogre later toured with Ministry (Ogre can be seen and heard on the &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; video and CD) and would also go on to provide vocals for Jourgensen&#x27;s side project Revolting Cocks. The other two members of Skinny Puppy, cEvin Key (drummer) and Dwayne Goettel (keyboardist/synthesist), did not approve of Jourgensen&#x27;s takeover, creating a &quot;glacial coldness&quot; between the band members. A couple years following the release of &quot;Rabies&quot;, Key mentioned to &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that he believed Jourgensen&#x27;s motive for assisting in the album&#x27;s production was to try and break up Skinny Puppy.

Much of the album had been written before Jourgensen was officially involved, though Key has mentioned that the process was influenced by the notion that Jourgensen might join them in the studio to &quot;jam&quot;. The group took into consideration what type of music Jourgensen would be interested in making, thus writing guitar heavy material such as &quot;Tin Omen&quot;, a song which makes reference to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. &quot;Fascist Jock Itch&quot;, also written with Jourgensen in mind, was inspired by an incident between Ogre and a few skinheads. Ogre states that he had been approached by the skinheads who then proceeded to question him regarding his &quot;loyalty towards communism&quot; (prompted by a small Red star on his pants). Feeling threatened, Ogre pushed one of them away and a short scuffle ensued. Other songs on the album, such as &quot;Worlock&quot; and &quot;Choralone&quot;, have been described as being more &quot;pure&quot; to previous Skinny Puppy material. The song &quot;Hexonxonx&quot;, a song which criticizes the use of oil (written in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989), has been described as being an exemplary mixture of &quot;twisted humor and Throbbing Gristle-like experimentation&quot;, while other entries from the album have been noted for their novel use of sampling.

The song &quot;Worlock&quot; has been played on every tour after its conception. A Roland Harmonizer was used to create the vocoder-effect during the chorus. Samples of the song &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; by the Beatles are mixed with an excerpt of Charles Manson singing the song; the excerpt comes from the 1973 documentary &quot;Manson&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
The original CD release on Nettwerk (and the licensed version on Capitol) was mistakenly mastered with Dolby B noise reduction, which resulted in a muffled sound. In 1993, the album was digitally remastered and re-released on Nettwerk.

Only one promotional video was produced for &quot;Rabies&quot;. The &quot;Worlock&quot; video was primarily a rhythmically edited string of horror movie clips featuring outtakes and clips from the band&#x27;s earlier video, &quot;Stairs and Flowers&quot; (from the album &quot;&quot;). The video, which opens with a &quot;Rated X&quot; graphic, was intended to be a critique of the concept of censorship in America. Many of the movie clips featured in the video were from films made by controversial Italian filmmaker Dario Argento, whose work has a reputation for being heavily censored by US distributors in order to gain &quot;R-Ratings&quot; from the MPAA. For the &quot;Worlock&quot; video Skinny Puppy included footage deleted from the US versions of such Argento films as &quot;Deep Red&quot;, &quot;Suspiria&quot;, &quot;Tenebrae&quot;, &quot;Phenomena&quot;, and &quot;Opera&quot;. Other films included in the music video include, &quot;The Beyond&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bad Taste&quot;, &quot;Dead and Buried&quot;, &quot;Luther The Geek&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;From Beyond&quot;, &quot;Death Warmed Up&quot;, &quot;Eraserhead&quot; and &quot;Altered States&quot;.

Due to the graphic violence of the horror film clips used in the video, and also copyright violations, &quot;Worlock&quot; was subsequently banned by MTV, and did not receive any television airplay. In 1992, Skinny Puppy released a compilation of their music videos, but &quot;Worlock&quot; was noticeably absent. According to Nettwerk, the video was omitted partially due to copyright problems and also because of concern the video would be banned by other countries which might find the video&#x27;s content obscene. However, in recent years the video has been widely bootlegged among fans on the Internet. &quot;Backing&quot; videos for &quot;Tin Omen&quot; and &quot;Choralone&quot; were produced for the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour in 1990, and have also been spread on the Internet.

A limited run of promotional mechanical pencils were made and sent to college (and possibly other) radio stations along with the album. Shaped like a syringe the pencils were white with black lettering &quot;SKINNY [PUPPY]&quot; and white on black lettering &quot;RABIES&quot;. They were approximately 4 inches in length.

The Mutants of Rock Tour, which was to include a quadruple bill including Skinny Puppy, Ministry, KMFDM, and My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, was to begin on December 27, 1989. However, according to Key, the tour was called off when Skinny Puppy collectively decided to pull out, citing concerns regarding the band&#x27;s then uncertain situation. Key suggested a potential line of shows for the summer of 1990, but expressed little faith in any tour supporting &quot;Rabies&quot; ever happening. Ogre ultimately joined Ministry&#x27;s tour for &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Since the album&#x27;s release, reception from both critics and fans has been mixed. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; said &quot;Rabies&quot; was more of a Skinny Puppy/Ministry hybrid and was not representative of the group&#x27;s best work.

Tim DiGravina from AllMusic stated that &quot;Rabies&quot; was a solid release, even though he felt the band was not performing &quot;at their peak&quot;. He goes on to praise the album&#x27;s implementation of movie dialogue, particularly commending its use in the songs &quot;Worlock&quot;, &quot;Tin Omen&quot;, and &quot;Rivers&quot;. DiGravina was, however, less impressed by Jourgensen&#x27;s contributions, asserting that the same qualities which made &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; a good album were not suitable for &quot;Rabies&quot;. Trey Spencer from Sputnikmusic was less favorable, calling the record one of the group&#x27;s &quot;low points&quot;. He was critical of the album&#x27;s use of simple (and sometimes &quot;formless&quot;) song structures and claimed that the sampling brought nothing meaningful to the table. Spencer was more receptive to the song &quot;Worlock&quot;, calling it the band&#x27;s &quot;defining moment&quot;, but concludes by saying that &quot;the rest of the album consists of two good Industrial Metal songs, three average songs, and five songs that aren’t worth wasting your time on&quot;.

Beth Fertig of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; panned the album as &quot;just another festering collection of noise&quot;, but pointed out the use of humor on songs such as &quot;Fascist Jock Itch&quot; as a positive element of the band&#x27;s music. Daniel Lukes of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; said that despite a &quot;handful of undeniably classic tracks&quot;, the album comes across more as a collection of &quot;Ministry B-sides&quot; than a typical Skinny Puppy record.

In a positive review from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, writers Jonathan Gold and David Kendrick list &quot;Rabies&quot; as an essential industrial album, calling it a &quot;slightly atypical&quot; offering that &quot;also rocks a little harder&quot;. This sentiment was echoed by &quot;CMJ&quot;&#x27;s Brad Filicky, who called the album &quot;a masterpiece of the industrial genre&quot;. Jean Carey of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; praised the album, calling attention to the use of sampling, the song &quot;Worlock&quot;, and Ogre&#x27;s vocal work, which was compared to a &quot;crazed Jimmy Durante&quot;. Carey concluded by saying that &quot;Skinny Puppy&#x27;s willingness to experiment and change makes [&quot;Rabies&quot;] well worth a listen&quot;. Mark Jenkins of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; thought the album was less theatrical than their previous efforts, but concluded that the album&#x27;s &quot;groove is as solid as any the Puppy has ever fetched&quot;.

<doc id="525147" wikidata="Q1267468" url="?curid=525147" title="Durotriges">
<text>The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion. The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they may also have lived in the western half of the island. There is growing evidence to suggest that the tribe was matriarchal in organisation due to several factors including: high status grave goods found predominantly in female graves and the society being matrilocal. After the Roman conquest, their main &quot;civitates&quot;, or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, &quot;the probable original capital&quot;) and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, &quot;whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced&quot;). Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae.

== Name ==

The tribe&#x27;s name is known from Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; and from two inscriptions on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, both dating from after the Roman conquest of Britain. It is not known if anyone referred to them as the Durotriges before they arrived in the area now known as Dorset.

The name can probably be broken down into two parts. &#x27;Duro&#x27;, which means &#x27;hard&#x27; or &#x27;strong place&#x27; and was widely used for early Roman forts, and &#x27;trig&#x27; means inhabitant. That would produce a meaning of &#x27;fort dwellers&#x27;, appropriate for the region&#x27;s many hill forts (although these appear to have been largely abandoned by the time of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43). 
&#x27;Duro&#x27; has also been derived from &#x27;dubro&#x27;, the British word for water (&#x27;dour&#x27; or &#x27;dwr&#x27;), and the second element has been interpreted as &#x27;riges&#x27;, that is &#x27;kings&#x27;.

== Territory ==

The area of the Durotriges is identified in part by coin finds: few Durotrigan coins are found in the &quot;core&quot; area, where they were apparently unacceptable and were reminted. To their north and east were the Belgae, beyond the Avon and its tributary Wylye: &quot;the ancient division is today reflected in the county division between Wiltshire and Somerset.&quot; 

Their main outlet for the trade across the Channel, strong in the first half of the 1st century BC, when the potter&#x27;s wheel was introduced, then drying up in the decades before the advent of the Romans, was at Hengistbury Head. Numismatic evidence shows progressive debasing of the coinage, suggesting economic retrenchment accompanying the increased cultural isolation. Analysis of the body of Durotrigan ceramics suggests to Cunliffe that the production was increasingly centralised, at Poole Harbour (Cunliffe 2005:183).

The Durotriges were possibly more of a tribal confederation than a discrete tribe. They were one of the groups that issued coinage before the Roman conquest, part of the cultural &quot;periphery&quot;, as Barry Cunliffe characterised them, round the &quot;core group&quot; of Britons in the south. These coins were rather simple and had no inscriptions, and thus no names of coin-issuers can be known, let alone evidence about monarchs or rulers. Nevertheless, the Durotriges presented a settled society, based in the farming of lands surrounded by hill forts, the majority of which seem to have gone out of use by 100 BC, long before the arrival of the Roman II Legion, commanded by Vespasian in 43 or 44 AD. Maiden Castle is a preserved example of one of these earlier hill forts.

== Settlements ==

The absorption of the Durotriges&#x27; ruling families into the Roman province of Britannia and the extent of Romanisation makes documenting the names of settlements occupied by the Durotriges before the Roman conquest difficult, but from a variety of sources several places are known. Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; lists Dunium, speculated to be Hengistbury Head, as an important tribal centre near their Belgae neighbours, but it is unknown whether if it was considered the capital of the tribal confederation, especially as several other settlements appear to be equally important from archaeological evidence. Known places of pre-conquest settlement include:
*Woolsbarrow Hillfort
*Maiden Castle
*Cadbury Castle
*Ham Hill
*Abbotsbury Castle, Allington, Dorset,
*Badbury Rings, Banbury Hill, Bindon Hill, Buzbury Rings
*Chalbury Hillfort, Coney&#x27;s Castle,
*Dungeon Hill,
*Eggardon Hill,
*Flower&#x27;s Barrow,
*Hambledon Hill, Hod Hill,
*Lambert&#x27;s Castle, Lewesdon Hill,
*Pilsdon Pen, Poundbury Hill
*Rawlsbury Camp
*Duropolis

== Culture ==

Burial of Durotriges was by inhumation, with a last ritual meal provided even under exiguous circumstances, as in the eight burials at Maiden Castle, carried out immediately after the Roman attack. Most Durotrigian burials are laid down in crouched positions within shallow, oval graves. One such inhumation of a young Durotrigian woman was found at Langton Herring in Dorset in 2010. The burial, which was laid down with a decorated mirror, had a radiocarbon date of between AD 25 – 53.

Although it was previously thought that the Durotriges strongly resisted the Roman invasion of AD 43/44, the historian Suetonius recording some battles fought between tribes of southern Britain and the second legion Augusta, then commanded by Vespasian, we do not know if the Durotriges, in particular, were involved. Mortimer Wheeler, who reported on the excavation of Maiden Castle conducted by himself and Tessa Wheeler between 1934 and 1938, interpreted a cemetery uncovered in the hill fort&#x27;s east gate as evidence for a savage Roman assault. Later examination of Maiden Castle by Niall Sharples in 1985-6 and geophysical survey conducted in 2015 by Dave Stewart have shown that Wheeler&#x27;s interpretation of a siege and subsequent massacre is unlikely. By 70 AD, the tribe was already starting to be Romanised and securely included in the Roman province of Britannia. In the tribe&#x27;s area, the Romans explored some quarries and supported a local pottery industry.

The Durotriges, and their relationship with the Roman Empire, form the basis for an ongoing archaeological research project directed by Paul Cheetham, Ellen Hambleton and Miles Russell of Bournemouth University. The Durotriges Project has, since 2009, been reconsidering the Iron Age to Roman transition through a detailed programme of field survey, geophysical investigation and targeted excavation. To date the programme of work has concentrated upon an enclosed late Iron Age banjo enclosure containing round houses, work surfaces and storage pits, a Late Iron Age cemetery, two Roman villas and a large Late Iron Age roundhouse settlement referred to as Duropolis.

A study published in 2025 of 57 Durotrigian genomes found that settlements were based on maternal lineages, with incoming unrelated males. This matrilocal residence pattern has not been previously recorded in European prehistory.

<doc id="525149" wikidata="Q1778247" url="?curid=525149" title="Codimension">
<text>In mathematics, codimension is a basic geometric idea that applies to subspaces in vector spaces, to submanifolds in manifolds, and suitable subsets of algebraic varieties.

For affine and projective algebraic varieties, the codimension equals the height of the defining ideal. For this reason, the height of an ideal is often called its codimension.

The dual concept is relative dimension.

==Definition==
Codimension is a &quot;relative&quot; concept: it is only defined for one object &quot;inside&quot; another. There is no “codimension of a vector space (in isolation)”, only the codimension of a vector &quot;sub&quot;space.

If &quot;W&quot; is a linear subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot;, then the codimension of &quot;W&quot; in &quot;V&quot; is the difference between the dimensions:
:formula_1
It is the complement of the dimension of &quot;W,&quot; in that, with the dimension of &quot;W,&quot; it adds up to the dimension of the ambient space &quot;V:&quot;
:formula_2

Similarly, if &quot;N&quot; is a submanifold or subvariety in &quot;M&quot;, then the codimension of &quot;N&quot; in &quot;M&quot; is
:formula_3
Just as the dimension of a submanifold is the dimension of the tangent bundle (the number of dimensions that you can move &quot;on&quot; the submanifold), the codimension is the dimension of the normal bundle (the number of dimensions you can move &quot;off&quot; the submanifold).

More generally, if &quot;W&quot; is a linear subspace of a (possibly infinite dimensional) vector space &quot;V&quot; then the codimension of &quot;W&quot; in &quot;V&quot; is the dimension (possibly infinite) of the quotient space &quot;V&quot;/&quot;W&quot;, which is more abstractly known as the cokernel of the inclusion. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, this agrees with the previous definition
:formula_4
and is dual to the relative dimension as the dimension of the kernel.

Finite-codimensional subspaces of infinite-dimensional spaces are often useful in the study of topological vector spaces.

==Additivity of codimension and dimension counting==
The fundamental property of codimension lies in its relation to intersection: if &quot;W&quot;1 has codimension &quot;k&quot;1, and &quot;W&quot;2 has codimension &quot;k&quot;2, then if &quot;U&quot; is their intersection with codimension &quot;j&quot; we have

:max (&quot;k&quot;1, &quot;k&quot;2) ≤ &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;1 + &quot;k&quot;2.

In fact &quot;j&quot; may take any integer value in this range. This statement is more perspicuous than the translation in terms of dimensions, because the RHS is just the sum of the codimensions. In words

:&quot;codimensions (at most) add&quot;.
:If the subspaces or submanifolds intersect transversally (which occurs generically), codimensions add exactly.

This statement is called dimension counting, particularly in intersection theory.

==Dual interpretation==
In terms of the dual space, it is quite evident why dimensions add. The subspaces can be defined by the vanishing of a certain number of linear functionals, which if we take to be linearly independent, their number is the codimension. Therefore, we see that &quot;U&quot; is defined by taking the union of the sets of linear functionals defining the &quot;W&quot;i. That union may introduce some degree of linear dependence: the possible values of &quot;j&quot; express that dependence, with the RHS sum being the case where there is no dependence. This definition of codimension in terms of the number of functions needed to cut out a subspace extends to situations in which both the ambient space and subspace are infinite dimensional.

In other language, which is basic for any kind of intersection theory, we are taking the union of a certain number of constraints. We have two phenomena to look out for:

# the two sets of constraints may not be independent;
# the two sets of constraints may not be compatible.

The first of these is often expressed as the principle of counting constraints: if we have a number &quot;N&quot; of parameters to adjust (i.e. we have &quot;N&quot; degrees of freedom), and a constraint means we have to &#x27;consume&#x27; a parameter to satisfy it, then the codimension of the solution set is &quot;at most&quot; the number of constraints. We do not expect to be able to find a solution if the predicted codimension, i.e. the number of &quot;independent&quot; constraints, exceeds &quot;N&quot; (in the linear algebra case, there is always a &quot;trivial&quot;, null vector solution, which is therefore discounted).

The second is a matter of geometry, on the model of parallel lines; it is something that can be discussed for linear problems by methods of linear algebra, and for non-linear problems in projective space, over the complex number field.

==In geometric topology==
Codimension also has some clear meaning in geometric topology: on a manifold, codimension 1 is the dimension of topological disconnection by a submanifold, while codimension 2 is the dimension of ramification and knot theory. In fact, the theory of high-dimensional manifolds, which starts in dimension 5 and above, can alternatively be said to start in codimension 3, because higher codimensions avoid the phenomenon of knots. Since surgery theory requires working up to the middle dimension, once one is in dimension 5, the middle dimension has codimension greater than 2, and hence one avoids knots.

This quip is not vacuous: the study of embeddings in codimension 2 is knot theory, and difficult, while the study of embeddings in codimension 3 or more is amenable to the tools of high-dimensional geometric topology, and hence considerably easier.

<text>The term district, in the context of China, is used to refer to several unrelated political divisions in both ancient and modern China.

In the modern context, district (), formally city-governed district, city-controlled district, or municipal district (), are subdivisions of a municipality or a prefecture-level city. The rank of a district derives from the rank of its city. Districts of a municipality are prefecture-level; districts of a sub-provincial city are sub-prefecture-level; and districts of a prefecture-level city are county-level.

The term was also formerly used to refer to obsolete county-controlled districts (also known as district public office).

However, if the word &quot;district&quot; is encountered in the context of ancient Chinese history, then it is a translation for &quot;xian&quot;, another type of administrative division in China.

Before the 1980s, cities in China were administrative divisions containing mostly urban, built-up areas, with very little farmland, except for the immediate suburbs in order to ensure a large supply of food or raw materials. As a result, districts were also mostly urban or suburban in nature.

After the 1980s, prefectures began to be replaced with prefecture-level cities. From then on, &quot;cities&quot; in mainland China became just like any other administrative division, containing urban areas, towns, villages, and farmland. These cities are subdivided into districts, counties, autonomous counties, and county-level cities. At the same time, counties and county-level cities began to be replaced with districts, especially after 1990. From then onwards, districts were no longer strictly urban entities—some districts today are just like counties, with large towns and townships under them governing rural areas.

==Types of districts==
===Regular districts===
A regular district under a municipality or prefecture-level city.

===Ethnic districts===
A type of city districts that are specially created for ethnic minorities. Currently there are five such &quot;ethnic districts&quot;: three in Henan, one in Heilongjiang, and one in Inner Mongolia.

*Chanhe Hui District
*Guancheng Hui District
*Shunhe Hui District
*Meilisi Daur District
*Huimin District (the term &quot;Huimin&quot; refers to the Hui people)

===Special district===
One county-level special district, located in Guizhou.

* Liuzhi Special District, Liupanshui

===Forestry district===
One special sub-prefectural-level forestry district, located in Hubei.

* Shennongjia

===Ten most populous districts===
===Number of districts per city===
==County-controlled districts (obsolete)==
A county-controlled district, sometimes translated as county-governed district; county district; or sub-county () is a sub-county in China. A branch of a county government, a district public office () is the administrative office in a district; it is not a local government. A county-controlled district was once an important subdivision of a county all over China from the 1950s to 1990s. It was common for there to be about five to ten districts in a county, then about three to five towns and townships in a district. After the 1990s, county-controlled districts began to be phased out, and their role was taken over by larger towns or townships created by merging smaller ones.

At the end of 2014, there was just one county-controlled district left in China:
*Nanshan District (Zhuolu County, Zhangjiakou, Hebei)

(See Administrative divisions of China for how these two types of districts fit into the general administrative hierarchy of mainland China.)

== Ancient sense ==
If the word &quot;district&quot; is encountered in the context of ancient Chinese history, then the word is a translation for &quot;xian&quot;, another type of administrative division in China.

&quot;Xian&quot; has been translated using several English terms. In the context of ancient history, &quot;district&quot; and &quot;prefecture&quot; are commonly used, while &quot;county&quot; is used for more contemporary contexts.

(See Counties of China for more information on the &quot;xian&quot; of China.)

The first single, &quot;Free&quot;, was the band&#x27;s most successful song on two &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts, peaking at #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart and at #24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks Chart. The album itself became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number seven.

&quot;Billy Breathes&quot; was produced by Steve Lillywhite and recorded at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York between February and June 1996, following Phish&#x27;s landmark fall 1995 tour. The songs &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Taste&quot;, &quot;Cars Trucks Buses&quot;, &quot;Theme from the Bottom&quot;, &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; and &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; were debuted in concert by Phish over the course of 1995, with the remaining songs not appearing in the band&#x27;s concert repertoire until after the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Bliss&quot; was not played live by the band until December 30, 2018, 22 years after the release of the album.

The album and its title song were named after guitarist Trey Anastasio&#x27;s daughter Eliza, who was nicknamed &quot;Billy&quot; as an infant. The album&#x27;s cover is a close-up shot of bass guitar player Mike Gordon, the first time that any member of Phish had appeared on an album cover. Phish frontman Trey Anastasio recalled in a 1997 interview that the cover came together very quickly on the last day of recording.

Upon release, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; is &quot;a quiet gem of an album&quot; that confirms Phish &quot;is much more than a jam band from Burlington, Vermont.&quot; The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 8, 1999. The album was reissued on LP by Phish&#x27;s label JEMP Records for Record Store Day in 2018.

== Recording ==
Early song ideas came from a scuba diving trip that Trey Anastasio and Tom Marshall went on in the Cayman Islands in January 1996. They then produced a demo which was given to the other band members at the start of the &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; sessions. Other songs such as &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Taste&quot; had already been in the band&#x27;s live rotation since 1995.

The album was recorded between February and June 1996 at the now defunct Bearsville Studios in the Catskills region of New York state. Early recording started February 1, with the band intending to produce the album themselves with engineering by John Siket. The first recording project was an attempt to create a sonic &quot;blob&quot; that filled an entire reel of tape. Each band member contributed on several instruments. This idea was later abandoned but elements were used on the tracks &quot;Swept Away&quot; and &quot;Steep&quot;.

Rough mixes of songs were made after recording for most of February and March. The band took a break from recording beginning on March 20, and each listened to the rough mixes during their time off. Rough mixes included the songs &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Grind&quot;, two versions of &quot;Strange Design&quot;, &quot;Swept Away/Steep&quot;, &quot;Talk&quot;, &quot;Waste&quot; and &quot;Weekly Time&quot;. Phish performed at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in April and then returned to Bearsville on May 1 to resume recording.

With the resumption of recording, Steve Lillywhite joined as producer on the recommendation of Dave Matthews. Lillywhite had never heard of Phish before he joined the &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; sessions. He reflected in February 2011:

&quot;Phish, for me, are the musical equivalent of watching a flock of birds fly across the sky: They don&#x27;t scatter every which way, but rather, they move with each other; they dip and dive, they go up and down; but at all times, they seem to have this radar, this instinct, for where the bird in front or in back of them is going. Musically, each member of Phish knows what the other is doing, which then carries over to the whole. The band can play anything, which then raises the question: Well, what should they play? With &quot;Billy Breathes&quot;, it&#x27;s the closest they got to making what I would say is a good stoner album. You know what I mean: you put on the CD, you fire up a big one and you just go down that road. There hadn&#x27;t been a good stoner record since &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; got close. I keep telling Trey Anastasio we can make a better one.&quot;

After Lillywhite joined, many of the songs were recorded in the early morning hours. &quot;We did a lot of that album at five in the morning, when the sun was coming up. It kind of sounds like that, especially the stuff on side two like &#x27;Billy Breathes&#x27; and &#x27;Prince Caspian&#x27;, &#x27;Swept Away&#x27; all that stuff was recorded as the sun was coming up,&quot; said Trey in a 1997 interview. On June 6, 1996, near the end of the sessions, the band played a surprise show in the neighboring town of Woodstock at a local bar called Joyous Lake.

In a 2011 interview, Anastasio recalled his method for composing the guitar solo for the track &quot;Billy Breathes&quot;:

On the song &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; there&#x27;s a guitar solo I like a lot. That&#x27;s a composed solo. I didn&#x27;t labor over it. What I did is, I walked around the kitchen—my daughter had just been born and we were living out in the woods in Vermont. I was in my union suit, chopping wood. I was not thinking about anything, and then I just started singing [sings melody] the first four notes of the solo. I had a cassette player and I&#x27;d run over and get it recorded. Then I&#x27;d forget about it. And then the next part came. It was a lot of wearing headphones while walking around. Cassette player in my pocket. Change a diaper, go to the store, and whenever I can disconnect from whoever I&#x27;m talking to in the room, I&#x27;d put on my headphones. So the point I&#x27;m making is that it still felt like improv.&quot;

The song &quot;Strange Design&quot;, which the band had been playing live since May 1995, was recorded during the &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; sessions but was left off the album. The band recorded several versions of the track before settling on a final version. This was later included on the &quot;Free&quot; European single CD release. Phish lyricist Tom Marshall spoke of the &quot;Strange Design&quot; outtake in 1996:

&quot;It was scrapped at the last second. The band was touring in Europe at the time and made the painful decision there – in Italy or France I think. The album was complete and about to be mastered. &quot;Design&quot; was to be the last song on the album – after Caspian. It was a bizarre version that no one ever really got used to. It was funny though – the second they got back to the States and played it in their new acoustic setup it was as strong as ever. It just couldn&#x27;t be captured in the studio for whatever reason. Cutting it was one of those great decisions – after working so long and hard on the song, sacrificing it for the good of the album took a very wide focus – as much thought went into cutting it as went into recording it.&quot;

Trey Anastasio recalled in a 1997 interview that the cover came together very quickly on the last day of recording.

&quot;We finished Billy Breathes and our manager kept saying, &quot;What are you going to do about the cover?&quot; So, finally, it was the LAST day, and it was, like three in the morning. They (management) said, &quot;We NEED a cover tomorrow.&quot; You know all those pictures on the back? We cut them out and stuck them on with scotch tape. Mike was on the cover he just shot a picture of himself. The whole thing took like five minutes!&quot; 

In a 2007 interview, Tom Marshall said that Trey Anastasio thought the album cover of Mike Gordon&#x27;s face ruined the entire album, a feeling Marshall himself shared as well.

<doc id="525159" wikidata="Q878882" url="?curid=525159" title="Togodumnus">
<text>Togodumnus (maybe died AD 43) was king of the British Catuvellauni tribe, whose capital was at St Albans, at the time of the Roman conquest. He can probably be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius.
He is usually thought to have led the fight against the Romans alongside his brother but to have been killed early in the campaign. However some authorities now argue that he sided with the Romans and is one and the same person as the client-king Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus, whose original name may have been Togidubnus or Togodumnus.

==Career==
Togodumnus is known only from Cassius Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot;, according to which he was a son of Cunobelinus. He probably succeeded his father to the kingship of the Catuvellauni, who were the dominant kingdom in the south-east of Britain at this time. Their territory took in the lands of several other nations, including their neighbours the Trinovantes and possibly the Dobunni further west.

He had two notable brothers, Adminius and Caratacus. In Cunobelinus&#x27;s later days Adminius gained control of the Cantiaci in Kent but was driven from Britain in 40 AD, seeking refuge with the Roman emperor Caligula. Caligula planned an invasion of Britain in response but called it off at the last minute.

Based on coin distribution it appears that Caratacus, following in the footsteps of his uncle Epaticcus, completed the conquest of the Atrebates, the main rival to the Catuvellauni, in the early 40s. The Atrebatian king, Verica, fled to Rome and gave the new emperor, Claudius, a pretext to conquer Britain in 43.

==Death==
According to Dio&#x27;s account, Togodumnus led the initial resistance to the invasion alongside Caratacus but was killed after the battle on the Thames. The Roman commander, Aulus Plautius, then dug in at the Thames and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final march on the Catuvellaunian capital, Camulodunum (Colchester). Dio says that this was because the resistance became fiercer as the Britons tried to avenge Togodumnus, and Plautius needed the emperor&#x27;s help to complete the conquest; however, as Claudius was no military man and in the end spent only sixteen days in Britain, it is likely the Britons were already as good as beaten. Leadership passed to Caratacus, who took the fight outside Roman-controlled territory and remained at large until 51.

==Togodumnus and Togidubnus==
Tacitus mentions a king who ruled several territories as a loyal ally of Rome into the later part of the first century, called Cogidumnus in most manuscripts but Togidumnus in one. A damaged inscription, naming him &quot;..gidubnus&quot;, places him in Chichester. The similarity of name has led some, including Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University, to suggest that they may be one and the same. John Hind argues that Dio was mistaken to write that Togodumnus died after the battle on the Thames: that the Greek word &quot;φθαρεντὸς&quot;, &quot;perished&quot;, may be Dio&#x27;s mistranslation of a more ambiguous Latin word, &quot;amisso&quot;, &quot;lost&quot;, in one of his hypothetical sources, that in fact Togodumnus was defeated rather than killed, and that the Britons wanted to avenge his defeat rather than his death. He goes on to propose that Togodumnus, having submitted to the Romans, was appointed by them as a friendly king over the territories of the Regini, the Atrebates, the Belgae and the Dobunni, becoming the loyal king referred to by Tacitus.

<doc id="525160" wikidata="Q592909" url="?curid=525160" title="Brainiac (character)">
<text>Brainiac is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Otto Binder and artist Al Plastino, and debuted in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #242 (July 10, 1958). He has since endured as one of Superman&#x27;s greatest enemies. The character&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the words &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;maniac&quot;.

In his comic book appearances, Brainiac is commonly depicted as a superintelligent android or cyborg from the planet Colu who is obsessed with collecting all knowledge in the known universe. He travels the galaxy and shrinks cities to bottle size for preservation on his skull-shaped spaceship before destroying their source planets, believing the knowledge he acquires to be most valuable if he alone possesses it. Among these shrunken cities is Kandor, the capital of Superman&#x27;s home planet Krypton, and Brainiac is even responsible for Krypton&#x27;s destruction in some continuities. His attempts to do the same to Earth have brought him into repeated conflict with Superman. Though stories often end in Brainiac&#x27;s apparent destruction, the character&#x27;s artificial consciousness is resurrected in new physical forms, some robotic and others more organic-based in appearance.

Brainiac has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in live-action by James Marsters in &quot;Smallville&quot; and Blake Ritson in &quot;Krypton&quot;. Corey Burton, John Noble, Jeffrey Combs, Jason Isaacs, and others have provided the character&#x27;s voice in animation and video games.

==Fictional character biography==
===Silver Age===
The first Brainiac/Kandor comic book story in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #242 (July 1958) was based on a story arc in the &quot;Superman&quot; comic strip from April through August 1958. In the comic strip story, Superman&#x27;s foe was named Romado, who traveled the cosmos with a white alien monkey named Koko, shrinking major cities and keeping them in glass jars. The strip&#x27;s Kryptonian bottled city was named Dur-El-Va. This cross-continuity conflict was not unprecedented; in 1958 and &#x27;59, editor Mort Weisinger used the comic strip to prototype a number of concepts that he planned to introduce in the book, including Bizarro and Red Kryptonite.

Brainiac is a bald, green-skinned humanoid who arrives on Earth and shrinks various cities, including Metropolis, storing them in bottles with the intent of using them to restore the then-unnamed planet he ruled. He was originally notable only for having shrunk the bottle city of Kandor with his shrinking ray and for using a force field. In his initial story, he also traveled with a white alien monkey named Koko; the monkey also appears in a 1960 &quot;Superman&quot; story retelling the story of Kandor&#x27;s disappearance (&quot;Superman&quot; #141 (November 1960)). Koko was quickly dropped from Brainiac&#x27;s stories, but a version of the character has made sporadic appearances as the villain&#x27;s pet in the series &quot;Justice&quot; and the 2008 storyline &quot;Brainiac&quot; in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. The villain&#x27;s descendant Brainiac 5 also had a pet named Koko for several stories in the 1990s.

In subsequent appearances in this early period, Brainiac was used mostly as a plot device rather than as a featured villain of the month. Brainiac&#x27;s next appearance was mostly behind the scenes, when he tried to kill Lois Lane and Lana Lang, prompting Superman to give Lois and Lana superpowers. But the villain remained unseen except as a plot twist at the end of the story. Brainiac&#x27;s next appearance was in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Return to Krypton&quot; in &quot;Superman&quot; #141 (November 1960), in which the villain stole the bottle city of Kandor, the only city on Krypton that believes Jor-El&#x27;s warning of doom for the planet, and which had already built a space ark within the city to save the population. Brainiac&#x27;s next present-day appearance was in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #275 (April 1961), which showed the villain planning to defeat Superman by exposing him to red-green kryptonite, which he had created, giving Superman a third eye on the back of his head, forcing him to wear various hats to hide it. Superman soon defeated Brainiac and sent him off into the distant past. This was the first in-story appearance of Brainiac&#x27;s iconic red diode/electrode-like objects atop his head, which had previously appeared on the cover of his first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #242 (July 1958), but were not shown in the actual story. In &quot;Superboy&quot; #106 (July 1963), an infant Superman meets Brainiac, and it is explained that Brainiac looks the same due to his 200-year life span. In &quot;Superman&quot; #93, Brainiac regenerates himself. It is revealed that he came from a planet called Bryak and, after a voyage in space, he returned to find everybody dead from a plague. He intended to get people from other planets (in shrunken cities to be enlarged with his growth ray) to repopulate Bryak, where he would rule them.

Brainiac&#x27;s legacy was revealed in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #276 (May 1961), in a &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; back-up story. This story introduced Brainiac 5, who claimed to be Brainiac&#x27;s 30th-century descendant. Unlike his ancestor, Brainiac 5 used his &quot;twelfth-level intellect&quot; for the forces of good and joined the Legion alongside Supergirl, with whom he fell in love. His home planet was given variously as Bryak, Yod, Yod-Colu, or simply Colu. 20th century Colu is a rim world found on the approach to the Magellanic Clouds.

In &quot;Superman&quot; #167 (February 1964), it was retconned that Brainiac was a robot created by the Computer Tyrants of Colu to spy on and invade other worlds. Brainiac&#x27;s distinctive forehead diodes are explained as &quot;electric terminals of his sensory nerves&quot; necessary for him to function. To explain the 1961 introduction of the villain&#x27;s living descendant Brainiac 5, the story reveals the Computer Tyrants provided the villain with an assistant, a young Coluan boy named Vril Dox tasked with masquerading as his &quot;son&quot; so others would believe Brainiac to be a trustworthy organic alien scientist with a family rather than a deadly robot. The young boy Vril Dox was designated &quot;Brainiac 2&quot;. In the same issue, the letter column contained a &quot;special announcement&quot; explaining that the change in the characterization of Brainiac was &quot;in deference&quot; to the &quot;Brainiac Computer Kit&quot;, a toy computer created by Edmund Berkeley (and based on the Geniac) that predated the creation of the comic book character.

In this same story, Lex Luthor discovers the Computer Tyrants could have given their robot villain a twelfth-level intellect but only gave him a tenth-level, the same as them, so he would not dominate them. Luthor frees Brainiac from imprisonment and increases his intellect to a twelfth-level one. He also implants a device to temporarily disable him or destroy him if necessary. The two join forces, but Brainiac later removes the device and blocks out Luthor&#x27;s memory of his inner workings and the fact that he is a machine. This story becomes the first of many Brainiac/Luthor team-ups. Meanwhile, Vril Dox leads a revolt against the Computer Tyrants, eventually destroying them and freeing Colu. Brainiac sees a monument to this when he returns to Colu later on.

King Kull later enlisted Brainiac and Mister Atom of Earth-S to attack the city of Tomorrow and speed up the rotation enough for the people of Earth to fly into the air. They are defeated by Green Lantern of Earth-Two, Green Lantern of Earth-One, Flash of Earth-Two, Flash of Earth-One, Mercury of Earth-S, and Ibis the Invincible of Earth-S.

====30th century (Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot;)====
At some indeterminate point in time, Brainiac fled into the 30th century. Developing the ability to absorb and manipulate stellar energy, he remade himself as &quot;Pulsar Stargrave&quot;. He became a powerful enemy of the Legion of Super-Heroes, and once masqueraded as Brainiac 5&#x27;s biological father. In current continuity, Brainiac&#x27;s connection to Pulsar Stargrave remains an open question, one even Brainiac 5 has yet to resolve.

===Bronze Age===

After Brainiac was revealed to be a robotic being, some stories would end him seemingly being destroyed, only for him to appear again in a repaired body or having transmitted his consciousness into a new form. Since he was essentially a living computer program that could be housed in different forms if &quot;killed&quot;, Brainiac was sometimes referred to on comic book covers as &quot;the villain who won&#x27;t die!&quot;.

In the 1980s, DC Comics attempted to re-define several aspects of Superman&#x27;s stories to boost sagging sales. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #544-546 (June–August 1983), Lex Luthor acquires a renewed sense of purpose and dons a high-tech warsuit, while Brainiac is reimagined by writer Marv Wolfman and artist Gil Kane and given a new appearance designed by Ed Hannigan. In a previous story, Brainiac had constructed a giant, computer-controlled planet to destroy Superman only to then be defeated and trapped in the planet&#x27;s core. In Wolfman and Kane&#x27;s story &quot;Rebirth&quot;, published in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #544, Brainiac attempts to free himself by causing the nearby star, Epsilon 4, to go nova and utilize its energy. Instead, his body is converted into energy; his living program, his consciousness, experiences a strange journey before returning to his technology, where a new body is created for him over the next few months. As Brainiac recollects, during his journey he saw a great hand reach out from a void, ensnaring him briefly before releasing him. He also remembers seeing Superman&#x27;s face at the same time. Reborn in a new body, the villain believes he has seen the Master Programmer, the divine force behind the universe&#x27;s creation, and that this entity created Superman as an &quot;angel of death&quot; to destroy Brainiac. More determined than ever to kill and study Superman, Brainiac now has a colder, more merciless, and robot-like personality than before (he claims he is without emotions, yet shows signs of hatred and fear in regards to Superman). His new body is overtly robotic with a skull-like face and a reflective, iridescent honeycomb-patterned &quot;braincase.&quot; He also creates a starship shaped like his new skull and adorned by metal tendrils, often referred to by fans and comic creators as the &quot;skull ship.&quot; The ship acts as an extension of Brainiac himself. Brainiac retains this robotic appearance until after the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; miniseries ends in 1986, rebooting DC Comics continuity.

This incarnation of Brainiac meets his final end in the &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot; storyline that ended the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Silver/Bronze Age Superman chronology. Lex Luthor finds Brainiac&#x27;s robotic head unit, with barely any power left. He hopes to team up with the evil living program again, only to become an unwilling host body for Brainiac instead. Fighting Brainiac&#x27;s control, Luthor begs a superpowered Lana Lang to kill him, who complies by breaking his neck. Luthor dies and Brainiac retains control of the body for a short time until rigor mortis sets in. &quot;Propelled by sheer malice&quot;, Brainiac&#x27;s head unit leaves Luthor&#x27;s corpse and crawls a few inches before finally running out of power for good.

===Modern Age===
In the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; DC Universe, Brainiac&#x27;s history was completely rewritten. The Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of Brainiac was now a radical Coluan scientist called Vril Dox who, having attempted to overthrow the Computer Tyrants of Colu, was sentenced to death. In his last moments before disintegration, his consciousness was attracted light years away to Milton Moses Fine, a human sideshow mentalist who worked under the alias &quot;The Amazing Brainiac&quot;. Needing cranial fluid to maintain his possession of Fine, Dox went on a murder spree. He discovered that Fine had genuine psychic powers and was thus a metahuman, which he frequently wielded against Superman.

====&quot;Panic in the Sky&quot;====
In 1990, Brainiac is able to take over the minds of several LexCorp staffers. He makes the scientists create a new version of the skull ship (saying he thought of the design &quot;in a dream&quot;) and use advanced genetic science to grow a new body for himself, resembling Milton Fine&#x27;s form but taller, more physically fit, and with the green skin of a Coluan. He also has a new braincase helmet that resembles his Silver Age diodes. Now free of Fine&#x27;s body and consciousness completely but still possessing the man&#x27;s metahuman telepathic powers, Brainiac confronted Superman and then left Earth to plan another attack.

Brainiac returned in the &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot; storyline after seizing control of the mobile planetary fortress Warworld and recruiting assistance from Maxima and the alien warrior Draaga. Discovering a lost and confused Matrix (an artificial life form who at this time operates as Supergirl), Brainiac brainwashes her into becoming his soldier. He clashes with the New Gods and then launches a pre-emptive strike on Earth. Rather than wait for an invasion, Superman gathers a large group of superheroes and allies, one team attacking Warworld directly while the other remains on Earth to counter further attacks. Through duplicates of his braincase, Brainiac briefly takes control of some of Earth&#x27;s heroes, but ultimately he fails. Supergirl and the other heroes are freed from mental control and the villain is rendered catatonic. His vegetative body is taken back to New Genesis for observation.

====&quot;Dead Again&quot;====
A year after the seeming death and then return of Superman, a dead body matching the Kryptonian&#x27;s appearance is found in his abandoned tomb, leading some to wonder if the hero&#x27;s return was a deception. It is revealed that Brainiac is no longer on New Genesis but revived and returned to Earth, leaving behind an illusion that he remained in a coma. While hidden, he created more delusions to turn the public against Superman and make the hero question his own sanity. The two battle and Superman taunts the villain by insisting he is just Milton Fine, a cheap entertainer. Fine&#x27;s personality seemingly emerges and shuts down the Brainiac persona. Fine was then escorted off to a psychiatric facility.

====The Doomsday Wars====
During a later skirmish with Superman, Fine&#x27;s body is irreparably damaged, leaving Brainiac with only a short time to live. With help from a new Coluan assistant named Prin Vnok, Brainiac retrieves Doomsday, the monster that seemingly killed Superman before, and uses him as a new host body. Now a cunning psychic with a super-strong, near-indestructible body, Brainiac attacks the Justice League. But Doomsday&#x27;s own raging mind fights back and Brainiac realizes he still needs a suitable host. Hoping to create a clone Doomsday form by manipulating human DNA, Brainiac attempts to steal a prematurely born baby Superman is transporting to a Neo-Natal Intensive Care Unit, the newborn child of Pete Ross and Lana Lang. Brainiac sees this as an opportunity for revenge, correctly concluding that Ross and Lang are close to him. Using a &#x27;psi-blocker&#x27; device, Superman thwarts Brianiac&#x27;s plans and the villain is forced to house his consciousness within a completely robotic body. Dubbing his new form Brainiac 2.5, the villain fears he is now trapped in this form.

====Brainiac 13====

At the turn of the millennium, Brainiac 2.5 revealed that he had placed a sleeper virus in LexCorp&#x27;s Y2K bug safeguards. This virus was intended to dramatically boost his abilities. However, the virus instead allowed his upgraded future self, Brainiac 13 (or &quot;B-13&quot;), to travel from the 64th century to the present day and take control of Brainiac 2.5&#x27;s body.

Brainiac 13 then began transforming Metropolis into the 64th-century version of the city, which he controlled, and also began upgrading Metallo into a giant-sized version of himself. Brainiac 13 then took control of several android superheroes, such as the Red Tornado and Hourman, and used them against Superman. The Metal Men&#x27;s responsometers were able to protect them from his programming, and allowed them to help defeat Metallo.

During a fight with the Eradicator (who was attempting to &#x27;hijack&#x27; the B13 virus and use it for its own ends), Superman discovered that Brainiac 13 could not cope with Kryptonian technology, due to incompatibility issues. This gave Superman a plan to stop Brainiac 13&#x27;s scheme. With the aid of the rebuilt Kelex, Superman tricked Luthor into connecting a Kryptonian battlesuit to one of Brainiac 13&#x27;s power conduits. Kelex then reactivated the Red Tornado to help Superman break Brainiac 13 down into his respective nanobots and trap him in the suit.

Brainiac 13 was able to work with Brainiac 2.5—now transferred into the aged body of Lena Luthor—and prepared a tactic against Imperiex for the upcoming Imperiex War. The Brainiacs successfully engineered Imperiex&#x27;s defeat, allowing Brainiac 13 to absorb Imperiex&#x27;s power and use it to overpower the combined heroes and villains of the universe while simultaneously devastating both Earth and Apokolips. Brainiac 13 planned to use the power he stole from Imperiex to conquer the universe and reshape it in his image, and is made so powerful by the absorption that none of the heroes, not even Superman, can hope to damage him. However, with help from Lex&#x27;s temporal displacement technology and Darkseid&#x27;s Boom Tube technology boosted by magic supplied by Tempest and the Amazons, Superman was able to destroy Brainiac 13 and Imperiex by sending them through a temporal Boom Tube where they were annihilated in the Big Bang. Brainiac 13 had his body disintegrated and the remnants of his mind scattered across sixty trillion light years, finally killing the chronologically last known version of Brainiac.

After the death of Brainiac 13, Superman discovered that the version of Krypton he previously visited via the Phantom Zone was a trap created by Brainiac 13. Having been defeated by Kryptonian technology, Brainiac 13 had traveled back in time to the real Krypton prior to its destruction. There, he stole the Eradicator matrix and Jor-El&#x27;s diaries, and created a false Krypton based on Jor-El&#x27;s favorite period in history.

Sometime later, Superman traveled into the future and battled Brainiac 12. He learned that everything Brainiac 13 did in the past was designed to ensure things reached the point where Brainiac 13 would be created. Brainiac 12&#x27;s defeat before his upgrade apparently reversed the advances Brainiac 13 had made to Metropolis.

====The Insiders====
Around the time of the &quot;Graduation Day&quot; event, a future version of Brainiac called Brainiac 6 used his &quot;granddaughter&quot; Brainiac 8 (also known as Indigo), to kill Donna Troy and ensure the fate of Colu. Indigo then infiltrated the Outsiders until she attacked the team, along with Brainiac 6 and his allies, Lex Luthor, and a brainwashed Superboy, who had attacked the Teen Titans. In the ensuing battle, Indigo died and Superboy broke away from the brainwashing, while Luthor escaped. While his ship was ultimately destroyed by Thunder&#x27;s density manipulation, Brainiac 6&#x27;s condition and whereabouts after the battle are unknown.

====Silver Age Brainiac in the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; universe====
Later stories revealed that elements of Brainiac&#x27;s Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; history occurred in the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; character&#x27;s history prior to his possession of Milton Fine and his first encounter with Superman. The citizens of Kandor recall that Brainiac stole their city from Krypton, and not the alien wizard Tolos.

&quot;History of the DC Universe&quot; mentions his defeat by the Omega Men, although this is not seen in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; itself, and noted a second Brainiac was created in a laboratory on Earth two years later. In the &quot;Silver Age: JLA&quot; one-shot, the Injustice League discovered numerous shrunken alien cities found in Brainiac&#x27;s abandoned spaceship.

====Brainiac&#x27;s updated mechanical form====

Brainiac later reappeared as a swarm of interlinked nanotechnological units. Its operation was to sabotage a Waynetech research facility accomplished by infecting Metallo with a computer virus and controlling him from orbit. Superman and Batman tracked Brainiac&#x27;s signal to an orbital facility and attacked. Brainiac&#x27;s nanoswarm body was destroyed, though he had infected the Metal Men during their previous encounter with Metallo. Brainiac proceeded to use them to acquire a prototype OMAC unit, which Bruce Wayne developed using Brainiac 13&#x27;s nanotechnology. Superman and Batman destroyed the OMAC body with the aid of the Metal Men, after the Metal Men overcame Brainiac&#x27;s control.

====Return====

Following revisions to Superman&#x27;s continuity in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot; #850, Brainiac reappeared in a self-titled five-part story arc in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #866 (August 2008), a Brainiac robot probe (resembling his skeleton-esque pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; incarnation, and mistaken for the real Brainiac by Clark) arrives on Earth and battles Superman. After the probe is defeated, information about Superman&#x27;s blood is sent to the original Brainiac. As Brainiac wakes up, his computer announces &quot;Attempt #242 in progress&quot;, a reference to Brainiac&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #242, and to the many encounters between Brainiac and Superman. In the following issue, Supergirl reveals to Superman that Brainiac shrunk the Kryptonian city of Kandor and placed it in a bottle, and that all previous incarnations of Brainiac that Superman has encountered were just probes, clones, and nanite-controlled bodies. She notes that no one has ever actually seen Brainiac. Inspired by Supergirl&#x27;s story, Superman attempts to find Brainiac and stop him. He heads to a world under attack by Brainiac just in time to be caught in a supernova as Brainiac destroys the system&#x27;s star and the populated world along with it. The supernova knocks Superman out, and he is caught and brought onto Brainiac&#x27;s ship.

Superman escapes from his imprisonment and sees Brainiac emerging from his &quot;bio-shell&quot;. This version of Brainiac resembles a much larger and more muscular version of the original, Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac, and has motives similar to the &quot;&quot; incarnation of the character in that he travels the universe and steals the knowledge of various alien cultures, abducting and shrinking cities from each planet as samples, and then destroys the planet so that the value of the destroyed civilization&#x27;s knowledge is increased. Superman attacks Brainiac, but Brainiac manages to overpower the Man of Steel before restraining him with the help of his ship&#x27;s internal systems. Brainiac inserts the subdued Superman into a machine that allows him to read the Kryptonian&#x27;s mind, with the intent of assimilating his brain. Brainiac&#x27;s ship then travels to Earth and prepares to abduct the city of Metropolis.

Brainiac successfully steals Metropolis, and prepares to fire a missile that will destroy the Sun and the Earth itself. Supergirl ends up captured along with the rest of Metropolis, but Superman breaks out of his restraints again and frees her. Supergirl stops the missile, while Superman battles Brainiac. Brainiac appears to have the advantage in physical combat yet again, but Superman knocks Brainiac out of his ship and into a swamp, where Brainiac is overwhelmed by the microscopic organisms covering his body. Superman uses this distraction to defeat Brainiac. While Superman frees the cities of Metropolis and Kandor, the villain launches a missile to the Kent farm in an act of spite. The farm is destroyed, and Jonathan Kent suffers a fatal heart attack because of it. Brainiac is brought to a top-secret military base, where the imprisoned Lex Luthor is assigned to discover his secrets. Luthor eventually manages to use Brainiac&#x27;s connection to his ship to kill the soldiers assigned to watch him. Brainiac manages to free himself from Luthor&#x27;s control, forcing him on board the ship, and the two make their escape.

Notably, upon learning of Brainiac&#x27;s modus operandi of destroying planets by destabilizing nearby stars when he is done collecting cities and knowledge from said planets, Superman openly speculates that Brainiac destroyed Krypton, which was destroyed when its sun went nova soon after Brainiac abducted Kandor and Argo. He also asks the alien what he did to Krypton&#x27;s sun. Brainiac ignores the query, neither confirming or denying his responsibility, though he does heavily imply it. Superman still believes Brainiac had a part in Krypton&#x27;s destruction after the end of this story arc.

====New Krypton====
Following this, Brainiac, now in possession of his ship again, unleashes his robot army against the newly created planet of New Krypton, and the Kryptonian citizens rise up to fight the drones. General Zod&#x27;s army proves totally unable to fend them off, as the Brainiac&#x27;s ship&#x27;s force fields are seemingly invulnerable and his drones are equipped with red sunray guns, allowing them to kill tens of thousands of Kryptonians. Superman, being the only one who knows how to penetrate his force fields (having learned the trick in the previous story arc), manages to enter Brainiac&#x27;s ship. Supergirl leads the Kryptonians against the drones, but is attacked by an anti-Kryptonian Brainiac probe. Superboy, Mon-El, and the Legion of Super-Heroes join the fight and save Supergirl.

After this, Brainiac shrinks Kandor again and re-bottles it, including a miniature red sun to de-power all the Kryptonians inside. The Legion, Supergirl, Superboy, Zod, and Superman all make it on to Brainiac&#x27;s ship, thanks to Brainiac 5 hacking his ancestor&#x27;s force fields and allowing them entry. The Legion explains to Zod that, just as Krypton&#x27;s city of Kandor is held in a bottle onboard Brainiac&#x27;s ship, other planets&#x27; cities are also imprisoned, and, therefore, Zod cannot destroy Brainiac&#x27;s ship until the cities can be rescued. Zod sends Supergirl off and then arrests the Legionnaires, branding them terrorists. Meanwhile, Superman is about to face off against Brainiac when he is knocked down by a kryptonite energy blast fired by Lex Luthor and subsequently captured. Brainiac locks him in captivity with the intent to experiment on him, but Superman escapes and meets up with the rest of the superheroes and Zod on a separate section of the ship. Zod enters the scene and engages Brainiac in combat while Supergirl, Superboy, and the Legion recover the bottled cities on Brainiac&#x27;s ship, including Kandor. Zod seems to be losing his fight with Brainiac, when suddenly Superman gets up and tackles Brainiac from behind. Before the battle between the two Kryptonians and the villain can continue, Brainiac&#x27;s ship starts to destabilize and descend towards the planet. It is revealed that Lex Luthor sabotaged the ship and re-sized one of the cities while inside.

Luthor&#x27;s intervention causes the ship to crash into New Krypton, destroying it while Supergirl and the Legion re-size Kandor. However, the city that Luthor expanded is still growing, now putting Kandor at risk. As Brainiac 5 works on the problem, Supergirl is shocked to discover Superman impaled by pieces of Brainiac&#x27;s ship as a result of the explosion. Superman appears to have been fatally stricken. Luthor, though reeling from the explosion, is pleased with all the destruction he has caused. Brainiac confronts Luthor in the ruins of the ship and is furious that Lex sabotaged his ship. Luthor mocks him and spits in his eye before Brainiac angrily snaps Luthor&#x27;s neck, killing him.

Now deprived of his ship and technology, and seemingly depowered by his ship&#x27;s destruction, Brainiac finds himself faced by an entire city of angry, solar-powered Kryptonians. Zod is eager for a final showdown with Brainiac, who calls Zod a coward for confronting Brainiac with his powers intact and an army of super-powered Kryptonians at his back. In response, Zod fires the red sun radiation from an Archer rifle at himself, to remove his powers and thus supposedly level the playing field as he prepares to take Brainiac down. Brainiac 5 gives Superman a transfusion of Conner&#x27;s blood and exposes him to a large dose of concentrated yellow sun rays, successfully reviving him.

Despite the loss of his powers, Zod is able to get the upper hand on the similarly powerless Brainiac and force him to his knees. Zod is about to shoot Brainiac when Superman intervenes. This causes a heated argument between Superman and Zod. Zod commands his soldiers to restrain Kal-El so Zod can proceed with the execution of Brainiac. Brainiac 5, sensing that this is his moment of destiny, steps in and teleports himself and Brainiac off of New Krypton.

It is revealed that Lex used a Luthor robot, supplied by Toyman, to accomplish his mission on New Krypton, and that Brainiac killed the robot instead. Lex discusses with Sam Lane how his objective, to bring chaos to New Krypton, was achieved. Lex has been working as an agent of General Lane all along. The disarray that Lex caused provides Lane with a window of opportunity as he prepares for the impending war with New Krypton. Lex receives a Presidential pardon for his efforts. The story ends with Zod rallying his people as he declares war on the planet Earth. The story concludes in the next miniseries, &quot;&quot;.

Mon-El plants the many bottled cities that Brainiac has captured over the years on various planets across the galaxy. These cities will one day become the United Planets by the 31st century, the same planets that will produce the members of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

Brainiac 5 takes Brainiac to their homeworld of Colu where he hands him over to Vril Dox, a.k.a. Brainiac 2. Vril Dox happily turns his &quot;father&quot; over to his people for his crimes. However Lyrl Dox, a.k.a. Brainiac 3, releases his &quot;grandfather&quot; with a weapon called Pulsar Stargrave. What then occurs is an all-out battle for Colu between all three present-day Brainiacs. Vril Dox even calls in Lobo for help. Brainac breaks out of his prison and, after causing much damage on Colu, escapes with Pulsar Stargrave in tow for parts unknown.

===The New 52===
Brainiac&#x27;s origin in &quot;The New 52&quot; is revealed in &quot;Superman&quot; #23.2. Vril Dox was acknowledged as the greatest scientist on his homeworld, Yod-Colu, given his advances in force field technology and miniaturization. He developed an artificial intelligence, C.O.M.P.U.T.O., allowing him to discover the fifth dimension. Dox discovered the fifth dimension was in a state of war, and a group of its inhabitants, the Multitude, had entered their dimension and destroyed over a hundred planets. Realizing Yod-Colu was next in the Multitude&#x27;s path, Dox tried to find a way to save his planet, even performing experiments on his son. The magistrates of Yod-Colu sentenced Dox to exile, but Dox used C.O.M.P.U.T.O. to take control of Yod-Colu&#x27;s computer networks. Copying the planet&#x27;s database, Dox constructed an army of robot servants called Terminauts and miniaturized the city his wife and son lived on and bottled it in a force field, while the rest of Yod-Colu was destroyed by the Multitude.

After the destruction of Yod-Colu, Dox constructed an army of starships and distributed his consciousness across a series of robots that would each travel the universe to preserve planets from the Multitude, becoming known as the Collector of Worlds. One of these robots attacked Krypton. Dox became fascinated by Jor-El, a Kryptonian scientist who actually saved his homeworld from the Multitude. Upon returning to Krypton, however, Dox discovered Krypton had been destroyed.

Referred to at first as &#x27;The Collector of Worlds&#x27;, Brainiac is first seen as the mysterious informant that supplies Lex Luthor information of Superman and his alien nature. Clark is having a dream of Krypton&#x27;s final moments in which an artificial intelligence that controls the planet wakes up robots in an attempt to preserve the Kryptonian culture. Later, while Clark conducts an interview in a robotic factory, the same harvester robots appear.

John Corben (the soon-to-be supervillain Metallo) is suddenly possessed by the artificial intelligence. It demands Superman. The robots create havoc throughout Metropolis, but Superman soon realizes that they are really after him. Superman fights the possessed Corben with the help of John Henry Irons.

Although they managed to defeat him, the alien sentience had already miniaturized and bottled the city of Metropolis and took it to his ship in space. Superman travels to the ship to find many alien bottled cities, Kandor included. The alien identifies himself as a being from the planet Colu where he was known as C.O.M.P.U.T.O and on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0. He claims that, without Superman and the ship that brought him to Earth, his Kryptonian collection is incomplete. The alien intelligence demands Superman make a choice: the intelligence will disable life support in both the Kandor and Metropolis bottles, and Superman must choose which city to save using indestructible Kryptonian armor found on the ship.

Superman decides on neither and wears the armor (which changes instantly into the current Superman costume design). Brainiac sends Metallo to attack Superman, but due to Superman reasoning with him over his feelings for Lois Lane, he breaks free of Brainiac&#x27;s control and joins Superman in his attack. Superman then uses his rocket from Krypton which had also been miniaturized with Metropolis to attack Brainiac&#x27;s mind, which the rocket was able to do since its primary mission was to protect Kal-El. In doing so, Metropolis was returned to Earth and Superman took possession of Brainiac&#x27;s ship and made it his new super citadel.

Notably, the ship Clark was placed into as a child was described as having &quot;Brainiac AI&quot;, leaving the identity of the Collector of Worlds in doubt. The Colony of the Collector of Worlds told Superman that its AI technology went by different names, beginning on Yod-Colu as C.O.M.P.U.T.O. On Noma, he was called Pneumenoid; on Bryak it was Mind2; on Krypton he was called Brainiac 1.0; and, finally on Earth, he is the Internet.

After this defeat, Brainiac retreated to deeper parts of the cosmos, and eventually came across the planet Tolerance, the setting of a bounty hunting glimmernet game show called &quot;The Hunted&quot;. Striking a deal with Lady Styx, overlord of the Tenebrian Dominion, he bottles a portion of the Sh&#x27;diki Borough of Tolerance to add to his collection. He encounters Jediah Caul, a former member of the Green Lantern Corps, who combats and infects Brainiac&#x27;s ship. Ultimately, Brainiac abandons his plans with the Sh&#x27;diki Borough and ejects Caul and the bottled city before leaving for parts unknown.

Back on Earth, during an investigation of 20 kidnapped people who developed metahuman powers after being kidnapped by Brainiac, one of these 20 infects Lois Lane, thereby giving Brainiac control over a close ally of Superman. Brainiac plots his return to Earth, using Lane to infiltrate Earth&#x27;s defense systems to allow an easier path for his physical return. and even upgrading her body to contain his 12th level intelligence. His minion Cyborg-Superman (a reconstructed Zor-El, father of Supergirl) constructs a portal to allow Brainiac&#x27;s command ship and &quot;daughter ships&quot; to travel to Earth from throughout the galaxy.

Superman, whom Brainiac had conspired to &#x27;infect&#x27; with the monster Doomsday to drive him away from Earth, uses his augmented power to attack Brainiac&#x27;s gigantic mothership and break through to its core and, finally, Vril Dox himself. The Coluan appears still-humanoid, and explains his reasoning for stealing minds from throughout the universe: he has concluded that if he can &#x27;unite&#x27; the minds of a certain critical number of people, he will be able to change reality itself. His motivation for this appears a desire to right the wrongs he feels responsible for: the loss of his wife and child back on Colu. His plan is undone when Superman drags him, mothership and all, into a black hole. But then, Vril Dox is snatched away to safety, it seems, by a being who appears to be the true Brainiac: an immensely powerful entity from outside the universe itself.

===Convergence===
This version of Brainiac, a composite of Brainiac from around the Multiverse, is revealed to be the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; era Brainiac who, having found his way into the Source Wall and into the Multiverse, was thrown back in the timestream and mutated by the effects of &quot;crisis&quot; events such as &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, &quot;Zero Hour&quot;, and &quot;52&quot;, creating a godlike being. He then uncovered the location of Vanishing Point from nearly killing New 52 Earth-0&#x27;s Michelle Carter, from which he could roam the complete history of the Multiverse, collecting doomed cities from defunct timelines, alternative futures, and parallel worlds to add to his collection, in &quot;Convergence&quot;, leaving behind an agent, Telos, to rule a planet of the same name containing the cities. Brainiac&#x27;s attempt to do this to a future timeline of Earth-0 was narrowly averted by the heroes in the story &quot;The New 52: Futures End&quot;; Brainiac was contained in a T-sphere, leaving Telos stranded without his master, prompting the events of &quot;Convergence&quot; in which the planets are bid to fight each other. When the events of &quot;Convergence&quot; nearly end in an irreversible destruction of the Multiverse, the time traveller Waverider, formerly the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Booster Gold, frees Brainiac, who reveals he is sick from his mutations and only wishes to return to normal, to being Brainiac of Colu. He sends most of the heroes home, and with help from the &quot;Zero Hour&quot; Parallax and the pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Superman, averts the collapse of the Multiverse from &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, and is returned to the normal Brainiac. His actions also allow various parallel universes and alternate timelines to exist as the new Multiverse.

===DC Rebirth===
In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Brainiac&#x27;s name is first referenced in an issue of &quot;Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps&quot;. The entirety of the Green and Yellow Lanterns (including Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart), along with Starro the Conqueror, are lured into a trap and subsequently hit with a shrink ray while on the planet Xudar, leaving them tiny and helpless. In the next issue, they are trapped in a bottle, and their jailer is revealed to be a robot claiming to run on &quot;Brainiac 2.0&quot; software. The robot heavily resembles both Brainiac&#x27;s 1983 skeleton-esque incarnation and the robotic drones utilized by the post-2008 version of Brainiac. It has a collection of shrunken bottled planets, and travels in a ship resembling Brainiac&#x27;s skullship. At the time it was not clear if this was the true Brainiac after &quot;Rebirth&quot; or yet another one of his drones.

The machine&#x27;s victory is short-lived, however, as it is revealed that Larfleeze was able to reprogram it to his side using an Orange Lantern ring, having rebooted its life systems after finding it inactive on his homeworld with its ship. Larfleeze is impressed that the machine was able to capture the Green Lanterns and Starro, and even more impressed with the machine&#x27;s shrinking technology, and plans to hijack its technology to put together his own collection. He takes the ship and collection to his homeworld of Okaara. However, upon being informed that the Yellow and Green Lanterns are still fighting inside the bottle and trying to kill each other, Larfleeze&#x27;s own greed for having everything gets the best of him and he ends up breaking the container. This frees the Lanterns, and somehow restores them to their normal size and strength, after which they immediately start rampaging inside the ship and trashing Brainiac/Larfleeze&#x27;s collection. Hal, Kyle, John and Guy go on to lead the attack on the Orange Lantern Corps. With everyone fighting together, the Orange Lantern Corps are quickly overwhelmed. Larfleeze accuses the robot of playing him; when it responds that it simply did what he programmed it to do, Larfleeze destroys it in a rage.

The Superman storyline &quot;New World&quot; later confirmed via a flashback cameo that the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, post-2008 version of Brainiac (the tall, muscular, green-skinned cybernetic alien scientist) still exists in the post-&quot;Rebirth&quot; continuity, and has encountered Superman in the past. Thus, the robot that defeated Starro, the Green Lantern Corps, and the Yellow Lantern Corps before subsequently being dispatched by Larfleeze was, in fact, one of his drones.

====No Justice====
Brainiac later arrived on Earth again and battled the Justice League, who proved no match for him and his ship, until Superman arrived. However, he did not come to destroy the Earth, but to deliver a warning: that there is a cosmic-level threat in the universe coming to Earth, one that the heroes of Earth are woefully ill-prepared for. Brainiac thinks he can defeat the threat, but it means teaming up with Superman and the Justice League and combining members of the League with some of the most dangerous supervillains in the DC Universe and sending them into battle against this extinction-level menace. Four teams outfitted with Brainiac&#x27;s technology are formed (including among other members, Lex Luthor, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Sinestro), with Brainiac himself working directly alongside his nemesis, Superman.

The &quot;No Justice&quot; miniseries begins with the Omega Titans, the aforementioned threat, attacking Colu, Brainiac&#x27;s homeworld, which explains Brainiac&#x27;s kidnapping of Earth&#x27;s superheroes and supervillains. Brainiac claims to have developed a plan to defeat the Omega Titans and the superheroes only need to follow his orders to win, but Amanda Waller uses the hidden Protocol XI, which involves kidnapping the world&#x27;s most dangerous psychics, to probe Brainiac&#x27;s mind and find out what he knows. The strain of the psychic attack causes Brainiac&#x27;s head to explode, apparently killing him. His clone-son, Vril Dox/Brainiac II, later revealed that if Brainiac&#x27;s plan had been followed, he would&#x27;ve hijacked the power of the Titans himself, destroyed Earth, and conquered Colu before going on to dominate the universe.

====Legion of Doom====
Brainiac&#x27;s body is later recovered by Lex Luthor, who sets Professor Ivo on reconstructing it with the intention of the alien joining the Legion of Doom. He initially tries to betray the Legion soon after awakening, but Luthor is able to convince him that they&#x27;re better off working together after a linking of their minds. The Legion&#x27;s plan revolves around reviving and empowering a cosmic being named Perpetua. Brainiac aids them in this goal, and as a result is able to go around the multiverse and bottle &quot;hypertime&quot;, essentially entirely different timelines. Confronting the Justice League in the 853rd century, Brainiac used the knowledge and technology of these hundreds of advanced timelines to upgrade himself into Brainiac One Million, a colossal new form of unparalleled power. He planned to destroy the timelines he had abducted after completing his battle, to keep his knowledge exclusive, boasting that when this iteration of the multiverse dies, he alone will have its knowledge. Multiple alternate Justice Leagues from across the universe prove unable to defeat him even working together. However, when Perpetua is finally revived at full power, even his abilities prove nothing compared to her nigh-omnipotence, and she decides to use it to turn him into her new control station/throne, effectively subverting him into a tool.

====Brainiac 6====
Brainiac 6 and other members of the &quot;gang&quot; first appear in &quot;Adventures of the Super Sons&quot; #1.

==== Dawn of DC ====
Brainiac has recently put Lobo&#x27;s city in a bottle because he believes that city will allow him to uncover Earth&#x27;s greatest secret. He then launches an invasion in Metropolis and captures most of Superman&#x27;s powered allies and Lex Luthor, with Superman unable to stop him. It is also revealed that Brainiac is seemingly dying, and has created clones to help him with his tasks. Brainiac frees Lex Luthor to hear his explanation on how he can bring Superman, and plans to experiment on Lana Lang. Brainiac convinces General Chacal, a general of Czarnians, to capture Superman, and sacrifices the Czarnians so that Brainiac Queen can get more power. Lex Luthor realizes Brainiac has been losing his intelligence and dying due to him creating new bodies across the multiverse and splitting his consciousness into them, causing strain in his body. Conner Kent uses his Tactile telekinesis to deactivate Brainiac Queen and weaken Brainiac&#x27;s ship while Lex Luthor completely deactivates Brainiac&#x27;s core mind. Superman realizes Brainiac has been experiencing emotions for the first time and has been trying to create a family so he can feel love. Brainiac persuades Superman to save his city, while he warps Brainiac Queen away before being seemingly killed by his ship exploding.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
Brainiac&#x27;s most consistent power (endemic to all versions) is his &quot;twelfth-level intelligence&quot;, allowing calculation abilities, enhanced memory, and advanced understanding of mechanical engineering, bioengineering, physics, and as well as other theoretical and applied sciences. For comparison, the population of 20th century Earth constitutes a sixth-level intelligence, while the population of 31st century Earth are a ninth-level intelligence. His Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; incarnation claims that his brain can process and sort knowledge of over four hundred ninety octodecillion beings (4.9 × 1059), which is an enormous number, about five billion times the estimated number of atoms on Earth. All the different versions have created devices such as a force field belt capable of withstanding Superman&#x27;s most powerful blows, and a shrink ray capable of reducing cities.

Brainiac&#x27;s advanced mental powers have shown him capable of possessing others, absorbing information from other beings, transferring his consciousness, creating and manipulating computer systems, replicating duplicate bodies for himself, and exerting powers to traverse or control spacetime. Among organic beings, Brainiac views only his frequent partner Lex Luthor as a peer intellect. Brainiac is usually depicted with incredibly high levels of strength, durability, and speed; the exact level varies, but usually hovers at around Superman&#x27;s strength. Brainiac&#x27;s exact abilities vary drastically throughout his various incarnations.

===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; abilities===
Originally, Brainiac was a scientist with no superhuman abilities aside from his intellect. He fought Superman via the use of his advanced technology and cunning, similar to Lex Luthor. Among these were a force field belt that protects him from all harm, a shrink ray to capture and bottle cities (even Metropolis), and a headpiece consisting of a cluster of diode/electrode-like objects. His cybernetic headpiece lets him interface with technology and discharge energy blasts from his head, which were powerful enough to significantly harm Superman. The Man of Steel described these blasts as &quot;blindingly painful... almost unbearable&quot; and a threat to his life. When the Crisis on Infinite Earths struck, Brainiac could detect the lies of others by reading their thoughts. The Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac was referred to by an omniscient narrator as &quot;the super-computer space pirate-- Superman&#x27;s most powerful nemesis.&quot;

Brainiac as an unpowered being reliant on external weaponry was largely still the case even after he was retconned as an android, but in the 1980s, everything changed. This was when he gained the abilities that would persist through all subsequent incarnations: super physical attributes, intelligence, and technopathy. His technopathic abilities extend to control of his ship, with which he shares a symbiotic relationship. He is capable of downloading his consciousness to spare robotic bodies in the event the original is destroyed or damaged. Brainiac can also possess organic beings under certain circumstances, as he did to Luthor during &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;.

The final body utilized by the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac (resembling a robotic skeleton) was technopathic, superhumanly strong, and resilient, and was capable of generating and &quot;spinning&quot; psychokinetic energies into a web-like net which could hold even Superman at bay. Among the knowledge he absorbed was extensive information of hand-to-hand combat techniques, making him a highly skilled combatant. Despite this, he saw physical confrontation as beneath him, and preferred to defeat foes with his mind.

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; abilities===
====Probes====
John Byrne&#x27;s re-imagining of the character has telepathy and telekinesis, as well as extensive knowledge of various alien technologies. He was an artificial intelligence who had inhabited the body of a human psychic and awakened his powers, further enhancing them with an implanted electrode headpiece. His vast psychic powers allowed him to seriously challenge Superman and defeat many members of the New Gods (including Orion) with a single blast, but this body&#x27;s lack of durability is the major liability and eventually led to it being rendered useless in a gasoline explosion. After the organic body was destroyed, his consciousness built and possessed multiple robotic bodies, and occasionally hijacks other organic bodies (such as Doomsday&#x27;s). His abilities were dependent on the body he was inhabiting at the time, in which could vary from weak as normal to far stronger than abnormal. His nanoswarm incarnation, known as Brainiac 2.5 for instance, can shapeshift, regenerate, bend technology to his whim, project energy blasts and force fields, and match Superman blow for blow; Superman stated Brainiac to have physical strength on par with Doomsday in this form. His strongest incarnation was Brainiac 13, who, even prior to absorbing Imperiex, was so physically formidable that Superman cannot remotely affect, much less damage him. By contrast, Brainiac could easily kill Superman in a short time, if he had not been devoted to torturing the Man of Steel.

====True form====
It was later revealed that this version of Brainiac (like the previous ones) is merely a mentally-controlled probe. The real Brainiac, who was a living Coluan, had himself both genetically and cybernetically modified. The true Brainiac lacked psychic powers, but still have abilities identical to his original incarnations. He possesses a level of strength and durability far greater than Superman; capable of easily overpowering the Kryptonian in unarmed combat, and withstanding several consecutive blows to the face from Superman without visible harm. His speed is vastly surpassing, so fast that he once caught a punch thrown by the Man of Steel. At one point, Brainiac 5 warns Superman that he would most likely die against Brainiac in a straight fight.

Despite his massive biomechanical modifications, Brainiac has a few weaknesses. Like the Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac, he is telepathically linked to his ship in such way that if separation of it without warning can disable him for a short period. But, prolonged periods causes him to physically deteriorate and become less powerful; just as Lex Luthor observed this while studying his unconscious body over course of several days when it was in custody of the U.S. government. Initially, he is only overloaded in particularly dirty environments and human society via mysophobia while landing into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. However, Brainiac does not seem to have this defect on Earth in his later battles, such as defeating Superboy, suggesting that he fixed it.

This Brainiac is an incredibly experienced fighter, but like his Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; counterpart is most dangerous due to the advanced technology he wields, much of it of his own invention. These include his classic shrink ray and force field belt, and other gadgets such as missiles capable of causing stars to go into a premature supernova state. His force fields are so impregnable that a direct hit from an energy weapon killed several solar-powered Kryptonians as collateral damage and didn&#x27;t leave so much a single scratch on his ship. Brainiac also possesses an army of at least ten or thousand humanoid robotic &quot;probes&quot;. These probes are strong enough to draw more blood from Superman and tough enough to survive some of his powerful blows. During the New Krypton story arc, Brainiac upgraded his drones with red-sun ray guns for the purpose of fighting fully powered Kryptonians. When Brainiac orders them to attack New Krypton, they quickly kill over eleven thousand Kryptonians.

He is a bionically engineered cyborg who wants to acquire more knowledge and become &quot;better&quot;. With his ship, twelfth-level intellect, and powerful technology, Brainiac has captured a thousand cities, absorbed all the information, and destroyed many worlds. Making him into the most feared being in that known universe.

===&quot;The New 52&quot; abilities===
Brainiac, in &quot;The New 52&quot;, seems to have kept most of the powers and equipment of his Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; incarnation (including his shrink ray, force field belt, and robot army), with notable additions. Brainiac&#x27;s ship has been massively upgraded in this incarnation; it is now larger than the entire planetary system, and carries within a huge invasion fleet of smaller ships in numerous types. He still appears to possess the physical strength, near-invulnerability, and fast speed of his Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; counterpart, as shown when he easily defeats Zor-El. By the &quot;&quot; story arc, Brainiac utilizes his vast intellect to become an enormously powerful psychic, augmented by the alien minds that he had stolen and digitized from across every galaxy. Then, he is capable of taking control of eight billion minds on Earth at the same time. He also demonstrates considerable mental abilities, claiming that their combined brainwaves throughout the universe can allow him to alter reality at will. He plans on using this newfound power to remake it into own his image. However, Brainiac&#x27;s plan prematurely ended when Superman battles him telepathically and crashes his ship into a black hole.

Following the &quot;Doomed&quot; story arc, it is further revealed that this Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Brainiac somehow escaped and mutated from the Crisis on Infinite Earths itself ever since. Becoming a god-like being, this version of Brainiac is virtually omnipotent with the ability to warp universes and time travel. Using this New 52 incarnation as one of his probes, he either created or interacted with different iterations of himself throughout the whole multiverse. Brainiac has grown so much in power that he can collect cities from other universes at will. At the end of the &quot;Convergence&quot; story arc, he recreates the DC Multiverse.

==Etymology==
A toy computer called Brainiac was introduced in 1958 by Edmund Berkeley, developed as a new model of the Geniac after Berkeley had a falling out with partner Oliver Garfield. The existence of the Superman villain introduced the same year was attributed by a DC editor to a &quot;remarkable coincidence.&quot; The product was given as the reason for the character&#x27;s 1964 shift in portrayal to a &quot;computer personality.&quot;

Etymologists believe the character is likely the inspiration for the common noun &quot;brainiac&quot;, meaning highly intelligent person, entering general use in the 1970s.

<doc id="525161" wikidata="Q2347168" url="?curid=525161" title="Brainiac (band)">
<text>Brainiac (also stylized as 3RA1N1AC), is an American indie rock band from Dayton, Ohio. It was formed in January 1992 by Tim Taylor, Juan Monasterio (Monostereo), John Schmersal and Tyler Trent. They disbanded after the sudden death of lead singer Tim Taylor in a car accident on May 23, 1997.

==History==
===Formation and early albums (1992–1997)===
Brainiac was formed in Dayton, Ohio, United States in January 1992 with vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player (particularly Moog synthesizers) Tim Taylor (July 20, 1968 – May 23, 1997), bassist Juan Monasterio (Monostereo), guitarist Michelle Bodine and drummer Tyler Trent. On March 12, the band played its first show at Wright State&#x27;s University Cafeteria, under the name We&#x27;ll Eat Anything.

After a slew of singles, they released their debut album, &quot;Smack Bunny Baby&quot;, on Grass Records in 1993. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Gary Gersh offered Brainiac a $2 million record deal with Geffen Records; allegedly, the band&#x27;s response was to tell him to &quot;fuck off.&quot; In November 1993, Bodine left the band, and was replaced by John Schmersal. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Bonsai Superstar&quot;, was released in 1994. In 1995 they played on the Lollapalooza side stage and recorded four songs in the UK for the BBC Radio 1 Peel Sessions. They joined Touch and Go Records and released &quot;Internationale&quot;, produced by Kim Deal (of The Breeders). The following year, their third album, &quot;Hissing Prigs in Static Couture&quot;, was released on the Touch &amp; Go label. All three of their albums were produced by Eli Janney (of Girls Against Boys).

===Electronic influence and Taylor&#x27;s death (1997)===
Brainiac generated buzz as a live act to see that resulted in opening slots on tours for Beck, the Breeders and the Jesus Lizard, and received offers from major labels. The most prominent bids came from Elektra Records and Interscope Records, although it looked like the band would be signing with Interscope. In 1997, they released an electronic-based EP called &quot;Electro-Shock for President&quot; which turned out to be their last record. 

On May 23, 1997, while driving back home, Taylor lost control of his vintage &#x27;72 Mercedes and crashed into a lamppost, which burst into flames. According to Schmersal, a post-mortem toxicology report indicated that Taylor had succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning, and was dead before his vehicle crashed; in &quot;Transmissions After Zero&quot;, Trent and Schmersal recount that Taylor bought the car five days earlier, and that the back of the car was so rusted out that the exhaust gases were leaking into the passenger compartment. The group, who were in the middle of pre-production for their fourth album, soon disbanded. A benefit show featuring The Breeders and Guided By Voices took place a few months later.

===After Taylor&#x27;s death (1997–present)===
After recording a solo album under the name John Stuart Mill, guitarist John Schmersal later went on to form Enon. Monasterio directs music videos, including two for Enon, and released in 2008 an EP with a new band called Model/Actress with Curtis Mead and Charlie Walker from Chamberlain and ex-Bullet LaVolta drummer Philips; Schmersal makes appearances on this album. Trent briefly joined the Breeders and most recently played with The Dirty Walk. Bodine became the guitarist and singer of O-matic and Shesus.

In early 2019, a documentary entitled &quot;Transmissions After Zero&quot; was released by director Eric Mahoney to favorable reviews. This included several live performances at various locations, with friend Tim Krug including New York, Los Angeles and their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. The film was released on DVD and streaming on February 21, 2020.

The surviving members of Brainiac also appeared on an episode of &quot;Conan Neutron&#x27;s Protonic Reversal&quot; to discuss the career of the band, the death of Tim Taylor and the documentary.

In 2022, the band was announced as UK tour support for Mogwai for February 2023. These dates were followed by a headlining tour in the UK, again in February 2023. In January the band released &quot;The Predator Nominate EP&quot; featuring never-before-heard demos.

==Influence and legacy==
During a BBC radio session, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; frontman Trent Reznor commented on Brainiac that they were a major influence on him, &quot;from a sonic standpoint.&quot; He also revealed that while recording 2005&#x27;s &quot;With Teeth&quot; he would use &quot;Electro-Shock for President&quot; as a &quot;sound reference.&quot;

Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie claimed Brainiac influenced his work on &quot;Narrow Stairs&quot;.

Matt Bellamy of Muse claims that a certain section in the song &quot;Exo-Politics&quot; from &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; was heavily influenced by Brainiac.

Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta state Brainiac, specifically &quot;Electro-Shock for President&quot; as an influential record. On their influence Cedric states:

The National&#x27;s Matt Berninger has also praised Braniac, stating: &quot;Seeing this band perform was something that would rewire your idea of a rock band. They were doing things both musically and performance-wise that seemed entirely free and unburdened by self-consciousness and insecurity. And it was organic, and honest, and fearless, and unhinged. They were channeling something very healing and potent. They were way out on a strange limb all by themselves.&quot;

<text>The Progressive Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island is one of three major political parties on Prince Edward Island. The party and its rival, the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party, have alternated in power since responsible government was granted in 1851.

==History==
The policies of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (PCs) are very similar. The major differences are in their allegiances to federal parties and in personalities. The PC Party began as the Conservative Party of Prince Edward Island, and changed its name in 1942 to reflect the development of the federal Progressive Conservative Party.

The Progressive Conservatives formed the government in Prince Edward Island under Premier Pat Binns, starting in 1996. The party lost its bid for a fourth mandate in 2007.

In October 2010, following the resignation of Binns as party leader (in 2007), a leadership election was held. Jim Bagnall became interim leader of the party in 2010 when previous interim leader MLA Olive Crane resigned the post to seek the permanent leadership of the party.

Crane won the PC leadership in October 2010, and served for over two years. She resigned as party leader on 31 January 2013, and was succeeded by Steven Myers as interim leader.

Rob Lantz was elected leader of the party at a leadership election on February 28, 2015, at the University of Prince Edward Island Sports Centre, but resigned on September 23, 2015, after failing to win a seat in the 2015 provincial election.

On October 15, 2015, the party chose Borden-Kinkora MLA Jamie Fox as interim leader

James Aylward, MLA for Stratford-Kinlock, defeated Brad Trivers and was chosen leader on October 19, 2017, replacing interim leader Jamie Fox.

On September 17, 2018, Aylward announced his pending resignation as leader, effective upon the election of his successor on February 9, 2019.

Dennis King was elected leader of the party, succeeding Aylward. King resigned in 2025 and was replaced by former leader Lantz as interim leader.

Traditionally, the Tories have done better among Protestant voters, while Liberals have had more support from Catholics. Politics on the island, however, has never been sectarian, and both parties have always had voters and members from both populations. Indeed, it has been the custom until recently for a Liberal incumbent of one denomination to be opposed by a Tory challenger of the same denomination and vice versa. This had tended to minimise religious sectarianism within the parties. The Liberals have also traditionally enjoyed the support of the province&#x27;s small Acadian population concentrated in Prince County at the west end of the island. Progressive Conservative support has tended to be greater on the eastern half of the island.

<doc id="525183" wikidata="Q1276148" url="?curid=525183" title="Morphological typology">
<text>Morphological typology is a way of classifying the languages of the world that groups languages according to their common morphological structures. The field organizes languages on the basis of how those languages form words by combining morphemes. Analytic languages contain very little inflection, instead relying on features like word order and auxiliary words to convey meaning. Synthetic languages, ones that are not analytic, are divided into two categories: agglutinative and fusional languages. Agglutinative languages rely primarily on discrete particles (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes) for inflection, while fusional languages &quot;fuse&quot; inflectional categories together, often allowing one word ending to contain several categories, such that the original root can be difficult to extract. A further subcategory of agglutinative languages are polysynthetic languages, which take agglutination to a higher level by constructing entire sentences, including nouns, as one word.

Analytic, fusional, and agglutinative languages can all be found in many regions of the world. However, each category is dominant in some families and regions and essentially nonexistent in others. Analytic languages encompass the Sino-Tibetan family, including Chinese, many languages in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and West Africa, and a few of the Germanic languages. Fusional languages encompass most of the Indo-European family—for example, French, Russian, and Hindi—as well as the Semitic family and a few members of the Uralic family. Most of the world&#x27;s languages, however, are agglutinative, including the Turkic, Japonic, Dravidian, and Bantu languages and most families in the Americas, Australia, the Caucasus, and non-Slavic Russia. Constructed languages take a variety of morphological alignments.

The concept of discrete morphological categories has been criticized. Some linguists argue that most, if not all, languages are in a permanent state of transition, normally from fusional to analytic to agglutinative to fusional again. Others take issue with the definitions of the categories, arguing that they conflate several distinct, if related, variables.

==History==
The field was first developed by brothers Friedrich von Schlegel and August von Schlegel.

==Analytic languages==
Analytic languages show a low ratio of morphemes to words; in fact, the correspondence is nearly one-to-one. Sentences in analytic languages are composed of independent root morphemes. Grammatical relations between words are expressed by separate words where they might otherwise be expressed by affixes, which are present to a minimal degree in such languages. There is little to no morphological change in words: they tend to be uninflected. Grammatical categories are indicated by word order (for example, inversion of verb and subject for interrogative sentences) or by bringing in additional words (for example, a word for &quot;some&quot; or &quot;many&quot; instead of a plural inflection like English &quot;-s&quot;). Individual words carry a general meaning (root concept); nuances are expressed by other words. Finally, in analytic languages context and syntax are more important than morphology.

Analytic languages include some of the major East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and Vietnamese. Note that the ideographic writing systems of these languages play a strong role in regimenting linguistic continuity according to an analytic, or isolating, morphology (cf. orthography).

Additionally, English is moderately analytic, and it and Afrikaans can be considered as some of the most analytic of all Indo-European languages. However, they are traditionally analyzed as fusional languages.

A related concept is the isolating language, one in which there is only one, or on average close to one, morpheme per word. Not all analytic languages are isolating; for example, Chinese and English possess many compound words, but contain few inflections for them.

==Synthetic languages==

Synthetic languages form words by affixing a given number of dependent morphemes to a root morpheme. The morphemes may be distinguishable from the root, or they may not. They may be fused with it or among themselves (in that multiple pieces of grammatical information may potentially be packed into one morpheme). Word order is less important for these languages than it is for analytic languages, since individual words express the grammatical relations that would otherwise be indicated by syntax. In addition, there tends to be a high degree of concordance (agreement, or cross-reference between different parts of the sentence). Therefore, morphology in synthetic languages is more important than syntax. Most Indo-European languages are moderately synthetic.

There are two subtypes of synthesis, according to whether morphemes are clearly differentiable or not. These subtypes are &quot;agglutinative&quot; and &quot;fusional&quot; (or &quot;inflectional&quot; or &quot;flectional&quot; in older terminology).

===Fusional languages===
Morphemes in fusional languages are not readily distinguishable from the root or among themselves. Several grammatical bits of meaning may be fused into one affix. Morphemes may also be expressed by internal phonological changes in the root (i.e. morphophonology), such as consonant gradation and vowel gradation, or by suprasegmental features such as stress or tone, which are of course inseparable from the root.

The Indo-European and Semitic languages are the most typically cited examples of fusional languages. However, others have been described. For example, Navajo is sometimes categorized as a fusional language because its complex system of verbal affixes has become condensed and irregular enough that discerning individual morphemes is rarely possible. Some Uralic languages are described as fusional, particularly the Sami languages and Estonian. On the other hand, not all Indo-European languages are fusional; for example, English and Afrikaans, as well as some North Germanic languages lean more toward the analytic.
===Agglutinative languages===
Agglutinative languages have words containing several morphemes that are always clearly differentiable from one another in that each morpheme represents only one grammatical meaning and the boundaries between those morphemes are easily demarcated; that is, the bound morphemes are affixes, and they may be individually identified. Agglutinative languages tend to have a high number of morphemes per word, and their morphology is usually highly regular, with a notable exception being Georgian, among others.

Agglutinative languages include Hungarian, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Turkish, Mongolian, Korean, Japanese, Swahili, Zulu and Indonesian.

===Polysynthetic languages===

In 1836, Wilhelm von Humboldt proposed a third category for classifying languages, a category that he labeled &quot;polysynthetic&quot;. (The term &quot;polysynthesis&quot; was first used in linguistics by Peter Stephen DuPonceau who borrowed it from chemistry.) These languages have a high morpheme-to-word ratio, a highly regular morphology, and a tendency for verb forms to include morphemes that refer to several arguments besides the subject (&quot;polypersonalism&quot;). Another feature of polysynthetic languages is commonly expressed as &quot;the ability to form words that are equivalent to whole sentences in other languages&quot;. The distinction between synthetic languages and polysynthetic languages is therefore relative: the place of one language largely depends on its relation to other languages displaying similar characteristics on the same scale.

Many Amerindian languages are polysynthetic; indeed, most of the world&#x27;s polysynthetic languages are native to North America. Inuktitut is one example, for instance the word-phrase: &quot;tavvakiqutiqarpiit&quot; roughly translates to &quot;Do you have any tobacco for sale?&quot;. However, it is a common misconception that polysynthetic morphology is universal among Amerindian languages. Chinook and Shoshone, for instance, are simply agglutinative, as their nouns stand mostly separate from their verbs.

===Oligosynthetic languages===

Oligosynthetic languages are ones in which very few morphemes, perhaps only a few hundred, combine as in polysynthetic languages. Benjamin Whorf categorized Nahuatl and Blackfoot as oligosynthetic, but most linguists disagree with this classification and instead label them polysynthetic or simply agglutinative. No known languages are widely accepted as oligosynthetic. 

==In constructed languages==

Constructed languages (conlangs) take a variety of morphological alignments. Despite the Indo-European family&#x27;s typical fusional alignment, most universal auxiliary languages based on the family have ended up being agglutinative morphologically because agglutination is more transparent than fusion and thus furthers various goals of the language creators. This pattern began with Volapük, which is strongly agglutinative, and was continued with Esperanto, which tends to be agglutinative as well. Other languages inspired by Esperanto like Ido and Novial also tend to be agglutinative, although some examples like Interlingua might be considered more fusional. Zonal constructed languages such as Interslavic tend to follow the language families they are based on.

Fictional languages vary among J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s languages for the Middle earth universe, for example, Sindarin is fusional while Quenya is agglutinative. Among engineered languages, Toki Pona is completely analytic, as it contains only a limited set of words with no inflections or compounds. Lojban is analytic to the extent that every &quot;gismu&quot; (basic word, not counting particles) involves pre-determined syntactical roles for every &quot;gismu&quot; coming after it in a clause, though it does involve agglutination of roots when forming calques. Ithkuil, on the other hand, contains both agglutination in its addition of affixes and extreme fusion in that these affixes often result from the fusion of numerous morphemes via ablaut.

==Interconnectedness==
While the above scheme of analytic, fusional, and agglutinative languages dominated linguistics for many years—at least since the 1920s—it has fallen out of favor more recently. A common objection has been that most languages display features of all three types, if not in equal measure, some of them contending that a fully fusional language would be completely suppletive. Jennifer Garland of the University of California, Santa Barbara gives Sinhala as an example of a language that demonstrates the flaws in the traditional scheme: she argues that while its affixes, clitics, and postpositions would normally be considered markers of agglutination, they are too closely intertwined to the root, yet classifying the language as primarily fusional, as it usually is, is also unsatisfying.

===Cyclical evolution===

R. M. W. Dixon (1998) theorizes that languages normally evolve in a cycle from fusional to analytic to agglutinative to fusional again. He analogizes this cycle to a clock, placing fusional languages at 12:00, analytic languages at 4:00, and agglutinative languages at 8:00. Dixon suggests that, for example, Old Chinese was at about 3:00 (mostly analytic with some fusional elements), while modern varieties are around 5:00 (leaning instead toward agglutination), and also guesses that Proto-Tai-Kadai may have been fusional. On the other hand, he argues that modern Finno-Ugric and Dravidian languages are on the transition from agglutinative to fusional, with the Finno-Ugric family being further along. Dixon cites the Egyptian language as one that has undergone the entire cycle in three thousand years.

Other linguists have proposed similar concepts. For instance, Elly van Gelderen sees the regular patterns of linguistic change as a cycle. In the unidirectional cycles, older features are replaced by newer items. One example is grammaticalization, where a lexical item became a grammatical marker. The markers may further grammaticalize, and a new marker may come in place to substitute the loss of meaning of the previous marker.

===WALS===
The World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) sees the categorization of languages as strictly analytic, agglutinative, or fusional as misleading, arguing that these categories conflate multiple variables. WALS lists these variables as:
*Phonological fusion – how intrinsically connected grammatical markers are phonologically to their host words
*Formative exponence – the number of categories expressed in a single marker (e.g., tense + number + gender for verbs in some languages)
*Flexivity – allomorphy and inflectional classes such as possessive classification
These categories allow to capture non-traditional distributions of typological traits. For example, high exponence for nouns (e.g., case + number) is typically thought of as a trait of fusional languages. However, it is absent in many traditionally fusional languages like Arabic but present in many traditionally agglutinative languages like Finnish, Yaqui, and Cree.

<text>An eroge ( or , &quot;erogē&quot;; ), also called an H-game, is a Japanese genre of erotic video game. The term encompasses a wide variety of Japanese games containing erotic content across multiple genres. The first &quot;eroge&quot; were created in the 1980s, and many well-known companies in the Japanese gaming industry originally produced and distributed them. Some &quot;eroge&quot; are primarily focused on erotic content, while others, such as Key&#x27;s &quot;Kanon&quot;, only contain occasional scenes in an otherwise non-erotic work. Games in the latter category are often re-released with sexual content removed for general audiences. Throughout its history, the genre has faced controversy for its use of explicit sexual content, and as a result has been banned from several console platforms.
== Etymology ==
&quot;Eroge&quot; is a portmanteau of . Such games are also referred to as an .

==History==

&quot;Eroge&quot; is a Japanese erotic video game. The earliest known commercial erotic computer game is PSK&#x27;s &quot;Lolita Yakyūken&quot;, released in 1982. That same year, Koei released the erotic title, , which was an early role-playing adventure game with color graphics, owing to the eight-color palette of the PC-8001 computer. It became a hit, helping Koei become a major software company.

In another opinion, Yuji Horii recalled in 1986 that he saw a demonstration of a Yakyūken-like game running on the FM-8 in the end of 1981, and he considered Yakyūken was the origin of adult games. Some writers say that &quot;Yakyūken&quot; produced for Sharp MZ computers by Hudson Soft is the first Japanese adult game.

Other now-famous Japanese companies such as Enix, Square and Nihon Falcom also released erotic adult games for the PC-8801 computer in the early 1980s before they became mainstream. Early &quot;eroge&quot; usually had simple stories, some even involving anal sex, which often led to widespread condemnation from the Japanese media. In some of the early erotic games, the erotic content is meaningfully integrated into a thoughtful and mature storytelling, though others often used it as a flimsy excuse for pornography. Erotic games made the PC-8801 popular, but customers quickly became tired of paying 8800 yen ($85) for such simple games. Soon, new genres were invented: ASCII&#x27;s &quot;Chaos Angels&quot;, a role-playing-based &quot;eroge&quot;, inspired &quot;Dragon Knight&quot; by Elf and &quot;Rance&quot; by AliceSoft.

In the early 1990s &quot;eroge&quot; games became much more common. Most &quot;eroge&quot; games, a fairly large library, found its way on the PC-9801 platform. FM Towns also received many games, more so than the X68000 or MS-DOS, whilst the MSX platform (which had many &quot;eroge&quot; games in the 1980s) was nearing the end of its lifetime. &quot;Eroge&quot; was much less common on consoles – only NEC&#x27;s PC Engine series had officially licensed adult games, and from the mid-90s, Sega&#x27;s Saturn. Both Nintendo and Sony disallowed adult video games on their consoles. Games also started to appear on Windows as it grew in popularity. There were also some titles on the arcades, such as the &quot;Gals Panic&quot; series.

In 1992, Elf released &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot;. In it, before any eroticism, the user has to first win the affection of one of a number of female characters, making the story into an interactive romance novel. Thus, the love simulation genre was invented. Soon afterwards, the video game &quot;Otogirisou&quot; on the Super Famicom attracted the attention of many Japanese gamers. &quot;Otogirisou&quot; was a standard adventure game but had multiple endings. This concept was called a &quot;sound novel&quot;.

In 1996, the new software developer and publisher Leaf expanded on this idea, calling it a visual novel and releasing their first successful game, &quot;Shizuku&quot;, a horror story starring a rapist high school student, with very highly reviewed writing and music. Their next game, &quot;Kizuato&quot;, was almost as dark. However, in 1997, they released &quot;To Heart&quot;, a sweetly sentimental story of high school love that became one of the most famous and trendsetting &quot;eroge&quot; ever. &quot;To Heart&quot; music was so popular it was added to karaoke machines throughout Japan—a first for &quot;eroge&quot;.

In response to increasing pressure from Japanese lobby groups, in mid-1996 Sega of Japan announced that they would no longer permit Sega Saturn games to include nudity.

After a similar game by Tactics, &quot;&quot;, became a hit in 1998, Visual Arts scouted main creative staff of &quot;One&quot; to form a new brand under them, which became Key. In 1999, Key released &quot;Kanon&quot;. It contains only about seven brief erotic scenes in a sentimental story the size of a long novel (an all-ages version was also released afterward), but the enthusiasm of the response was unprecedented, and &quot;Kanon&quot; sold over 300,000 copies. In 2002 a 13-episode anime series was produced, as well as another 24-episode anime series in 2006. According to Satoshi Todome&#x27;s &quot;A History of Eroge&quot;, &quot;Kanon&quot; is still the standard for modern &quot;eroge&quot; and is referred to as a &quot;baptism&quot; for young otaku in Japan. Although many &quot;eroge&quot; still market themselves primarily on sex, &quot;eroge&quot; that focus on story are now a major established part of Japanese otaku culture. Voice actors who have voiced for &quot;eroge&quot; have often been credited under a pseudonym.

As the visual novel standard was adopted, the erotic parts in &quot;eroge&quot; began to become less and less apparent. Many &quot;eroge&quot; become more story-oriented than sex-oriented, making story the main focus for many modern &quot;eroge&quot;. More and more people who used to reject such type of games began to become more open-minded, realizing that &quot;eroge&quot; are not just about sex anymore. A lot of story-focused &quot;eroge&quot; tend to have only a few erotic scenes.

Another subgenre is called , in which sexual gratification of the player is the main focus of the game.

==Gameplay==

There is no set definition for the gameplay of &quot;eroge&quot;, except that they all include explicit erotic or sexual content depending on the game. Like other pornographic media in Japan, erotic scenes feature censorship of genitalia, only becoming uncensored if the game is licensed and released outside Japan, unless produced illegally by &quot;dōjin&quot; (usually with a construction kit like NScripter or RPG Maker). Additionally, some games may receive an &quot;all-ages&quot; version, such as a port to consoles or handheld devices where pornographic content is not allowed, which either remove or censor the sex scenes entirely.

&quot;Eroge&quot; is most often a visual novel or dating sim. However, there are also many other gameplay genres represented within &quot;eroge&quot;, such as role-playing games, mahjong games, or puzzle games. Some &quot;eroge&quot;, such as those made by Illusion Soft, are just simulations of sex, with no &quot;conventional&quot; gameplay included.

<text>A spelling pronunciation is the pronunciation of a word according to its spelling when this differs from a longstanding standard or traditional pronunciation. Words that are spelled with letters that were never pronounced or that were not pronounced for many generations or even hundreds of years have increasingly been pronounced as written, especially since the arrival of mandatory schooling and universal literacy.

Examples of words with silent letters that have begun to be often or sometimes pronounced include &quot;often&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;island&quot;, and &quot;knife&quot;. In addition, words traditionally pronounced with reduced vowels or omitted consonants (e.g. &quot;cupboard&quot;, &quot;Worcester&quot;), may be subject to a spelling pronunciation.

If a word&#x27;s spelling was standardized prior to sound changes that produced its traditional pronunciation, a spelling pronunciation may reflect an even older pronunciation. This is often the case with compound words (e.g., &quot;waistcoat&quot;, &quot;cupboard&quot;, &quot;forehead&quot;). It is also the case for many words with silent letters (e.g. &quot;often&quot;), though not all—silent letters are sometimes added for etymological reasons, to reflect a word&#x27;s spelling in its language of origin (e.g. &quot;victual&quot;, rhyming with &quot;little&quot; but derived from Late Latin &quot;victualia&quot;). Some silent letters were added on the basis of erroneous etymologies, as in the cases of the words &quot;island&quot; and &quot;scythe&quot;.

Spelling pronunciations are often prescriptively discouraged and perceived as incorrect next to the traditionally accepted, and usually more widespread, pronunciation. If a spelling pronunciation persists and becomes more common, it may eventually join the existing form as a standard variant (for example &quot;waistcoat&quot; and &quot;often&quot;), or even become the dominant pronunciation (as with &quot;forehead&quot; and &quot;falcon&quot;).

==Prevalence and causes==
A large number of easily noticeable spelling pronunciations occurs only in languages such as French and English in which spelling tends to not indicate the current pronunciation. Because all languages have at least some words which are not spelled as pronounced, spelling pronunciations can arise in all languages. This is of course especially true for people who are only taught to read and write and who are not taught when the spelling indicates an outdated (or etymologically incorrect) pronunciation. In other words, when many people do not clearly understand where spelling came from and what it is (a tool for recording speech, not the other way around), spelling pronunciations are common.

On the other hand, spelling pronunciations are also evidence of the reciprocal effects of spoken and written language on each other. Many spellings represent older forms and corresponding older pronunciations. Some spellings, however, are not etymologically correct.

Speakers of a language often privilege the spelling of words over common pronunciation, leading to a preference for, or prestige of, spelling pronunciation, with the written language affecting and changing the spoken language. Pronunciations can then arise that are similar to older pronunciations or that can even be completely new pronunciations that are suggested by the spelling but never occurred before.

==Examples of English words with common spelling pronunciations==
* &quot;kiln&quot; with a fully pronounced n, instead of a silent n. Kiln was originally pronounced kil with the n silent, as is referenced in Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of 1828. From &quot;English Words as Spoken and Written for Upper Grades&quot; by James A. Bowen 1900: &quot;The digraph ln, n silent, occurs in kiln. A fall down the kiln can kill you.&quot;
* &quot;often&quot;, pronounced with . This is actually a reversion to the 15th-century pronunciation, but the pronunciation without is still preferred by 73% of British speakers and 78% of American speakers. Older dictionaries do not list the pronunciation with although the 2nd edition of the OED does (and the first edition notes the pronunciation with the comment that it is prevalent in the south of England and often used in singing; see the &quot;Dictionary of American Regional English&quot; for contemporaneous citations that discuss the status of the competing pronunciations). The sporadic nature of such shifts is apparent upon examination of examples such as &quot;whistle&quot;, &quot;listen&quot; and &quot;soften&quot; in which the &quot;t&quot; remains usually silent.
* &quot;forehead&quot; once rhymed with &quot;horrid&quot; but is now pronounced with the second syllable as by 85% of American speakers and 65% of British speakers. This is actually a reversion to the original pronunciation.
* &quot;clothes&quot; was historically pronounced the same way as the verb &quot;close&quot; (&quot;Whenas in silks my Julia goes/.../The liquefaction of her clothes&quot;—Herrick), but many speakers now insert a , a voiced &quot;th&quot;. This is actually a reversion to the 15th-century pronunciation.
* &quot;salmon&quot; is pronounced by a minority of English speakers with , due to the letter l being reintroduced, despite being neither written nor pronounced in the original Anglo-French pronunciation.
* &quot;falcon&quot; is now nearly always pronounced with , and only 3% of speakers have no . The was silent in the old pronunciation: compare French and the older English spellings &quot;faucon&quot; and &quot;fawcon&quot;. That may suggest either analogical change or the reborrowing of the original Latin.
* &quot;alms&quot;, &quot;balm&quot;, &quot;calm&quot;, &quot;psalm&quot;, etc. are now often pronounced with in some parts of the United States. In most of the United Kingdom, the traditional pronunciation continues to prevail.
* &quot;comptroller&quot; is often pronounced with ; the accepted pronunciation is controller (the &quot;mp&quot; spelling is based on the mistaken idea that the word is related to &quot;comp&quot;(&quot;u&quot;)&quot;tare&quot; &quot;count, compute,&quot; but it comes from &quot;contre-roll&quot; &quot;file copy&quot;).
* &quot;ye&quot; (actually, &quot;yͤ&quot; or &quot;Þe&quot;), the definite article, as in &quot;Ye Olde Coffee Shoppe&quot;, is often pronounced like the archaic English pronoun &quot;ye&quot; instead of as the word &quot;the&quot;, based on the misleading use of the symbol &quot;y&quot; to substitute for the archaic printer&#x27;s mark &quot;Þ&quot;: the letter thorn. (On the other hand, the beginning of the pronoun &quot;ye&quot; in Middle and Early Modern English is correctly pronounced like the beginning of &quot;you&quot;.)
* &quot;Mackenzie, Menzies, Dalziel&quot; now include the sound in place of the original , due to the insular flat-topped &quot;g&quot; of Gaelic scripts being commonly transcribed into English as the similar-looking letter &quot;z&quot;.
* &quot;armadillo&quot; and other words from Spanish with the double-L pronounced instead of (the latter being the closest approximation to the sound in Latin American Spanish); similarly, the Italian-sourced &quot;maraschino&quot; (cherry) and &quot;bruschetta&quot; with the associated with that consonant cluster in German instead of the of Italian.
* &quot;victuals&quot;, pronounced (rhyming with &quot;skittles&quot;), whose &quot;c&quot; (for a consonant that had been lost long before the word was borrowed from French) was re-introduced on etymological grounds, and the word is sometimes pronounced with . The original pronunciation is reflected in, for example, the brand name &quot;Tender Vittles&quot;.
* The pronunciation of &quot;waistcoat&quot; as &quot;waist-coat&quot; is now more common than the previous pronunciation .
* &quot;conduit&quot;, historically pronounced or , is now nearly always pronounced in most of the United States.
* &quot;covert&quot;, historically pronounced (reflecting its link with the verb &quot;cover&quot;) is now usually pronounced , by analogy to &quot;overt&quot;.
* &quot;medicine&quot;, historically pronounced with two syllables but now quite often with three (some speakers use two when they mean medicaments and three when they mean medical knowledge; the pronunciation with three syllables is standard in the United States).
* &quot;Bartholomew&quot;, formerly pronounced or , is now .
* &quot;Anthony&quot; (from Latin ), now (in Anglophone countries outside the UK) is typically rather than .
* Numerous placenames with traditional pronunciations have been displaced by ones influenced by the spelling: &quot;St. Louis&quot;, formerly now (in the US) , &quot;Papillion&quot; (Nebraska), formerly now . Montpelier, the capital of Vermont, is now pronounced , instead of the French .
* Sir George Everest&#x27;s surname is pronounced . The mountain named after him – &quot;Mount Everest&quot; – is generally pronounced .
* Interjections such as &quot;tsk tsk!&quot; or &quot;tut tut!&quot; (a pair of dental clicks), now commonly and .
* The words &quot;Arctic&quot;, &quot;Antarctic&quot; and &quot;Antarctica&quot; were originally pronounced without the first , but the spelling pronunciation has become very common. The first c was originally added to the spelling for etymological reasons and was then misunderstood as not being silent.
* &quot;zoology&quot;, which is often pronounced zoo-ology (), though, technically, this is likely influenced more by the word zoo (rhyming with goo) than by its spelling because it is never pronounced zoo-logy (). (It has been posited that dropping the diaeresis in &quot;zoölogy&quot; antiquated the pronunciation .) A similar case might be the pronunciation outside the United States of &quot;hecatomb&quot; as rhyming with deck a tomb and pronounced instead of .
* &quot;hotel&quot;, originally pronounced because of the pronunciation of the French , is now usually pronounced with an audible &quot;h&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; is pronounced .
* &quot;herb&quot;, a word with origins in Old French, is generally pronounced with a silent &quot;h&quot; in the United States. The same was true of the United Kingdom until the 19th century, when it adopted a spelling pronunciation, with an audible &quot;h&quot;.
* &quot;Ralph&quot;, originally pronounced or in the United Kingdom, is now often pronounced .
* German loanwords such as &quot;spiel&quot; and &quot;stein&quot; are sometimes pronounced as beginning with , as if they were native English words, instead of . In German, initial &quot;s&quot;, immediately before &quot;p&quot; or &quot;t&quot;, is pronounced as if it were &quot;sch&quot; .
* &quot;nephew&quot; was, until recent generations, predominantly pronounced in Britain, descended from Middle English &quot;&quot; and originally loaned from Old French &quot;,&quot; a spelling which remains unchanged into modern French. But the &quot;v&quot; was later changed to &quot;ph&quot; where the &quot;p&quot; hints at its Latin root &quot;,&quot; which can be found in more recent Latin loanwords like &quot;nepotism.&quot; Today, spelling pronunciation has shifted the word&#x27;s pronunciation predominantly to .

==Opinions==

Spelling pronunciations give rise to varied opinions. Often, those who retain the old pronunciation consider the spelling pronunciation to be a mark of ignorance or insecurity. Those who use a spelling pronunciation may not be aware that it is one and consider the earlier version to be slovenly since it slurs over a letter. Conversely, the users of some innovative pronunciations such as (for &quot;February&quot;) may regard another, earlier version as a pedantic spelling pronunciation.

Henry Watson Fowler (1858–1933) reported that in his day, there was a conscious movement among schoolteachers and others encouraging people to abandon anomalous traditional pronunciations and to speak as is spelled. According to major scholars of early modern English (Dobson, Wyld et al.), in the 17th century, there was already beginning an intellectual trend in England to pronounce as is spelled. That presupposes a standard spelling system, which was only beginning to form at the time.
Similarly, quite a large number of corrections slowly spread from scholars to the general public in France, starting several centuries ago.

A different variety of spelling pronunciations are phonetic adaptations, pronunciations of the written form of foreign words within the frame of the phonemic system of the language that accepts them. An example of that process is &quot;garage&quot; ( in French), which is sometimes pronounced in English.

==Children and foreigners==

Children who read frequently often have spelling pronunciations because, if they do not consult a dictionary, they have only the spelling to indicate the pronunciation of words that are uncommon in the spoken language. Well-read second language learners may also have spelling pronunciations.

In some instances, a population in a formerly non-English-speaking area may retain such second language markers in the now native-English speaking population. For example, Scottish Standard English is replete with second language marks from when Scots started to be subsumed by English in the 17th century.

However, since there are many words that one reads far more often than one hears, adult native-language speakers also succumb. In such circumstances, the spelling pronunciation may well become more comprehensible than the other. That, in turn, leads to the language evolution mentioned above. What is a spelling pronunciation in one generation can become the standard pronunciation in the next.

==In other languages==
In French, the modern pronunciation of the 16th-century French author Montaigne’s name as , rather than the contemporary , is a spelling pronunciation.

When English &quot;club&quot; was first borrowed into French, the approved pronunciation was , as being a reasonable approximation of the English. The standard then became on the basis of the spelling, and later, in Europe, , deemed closer to the English original. The standard pronunciation in Quebec French remains . Similarly, &quot;shampooing&quot; &quot;shampoo; product for washing the hair&quot; at the time of borrowing was but it is now .

Old Italian had a pair of post-alveolar affricates and (as in and , written &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;privilegio&quot;), and one of post-alveolar fricatives and (as in and , written &quot;bascio/bacio&quot; and &quot;presgio/pregio&quot;), which could only occur between vowels. During the 13th century, the afore mentioned affricates became allophonically fricatives if singleton and intervocalic (the modern Tuscan pronunciation of &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;privilegio&quot; being and ), essentially merging - and - into positional allophones and rendering obsolete and useless the -s- spellings. After the Italian Unification, the Tuscan pronunciation of &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;privilegio&quot; was deemed too vulgar and dialectal for the standard language, and the original pronunciation was indirectly restored; in the modern Standard Italian accent, they&#x27;re always realized as and . Since the spelling did not distinguish between the original pairs of post-alveolar affricates and fricatives, &quot;bacio&quot; and &quot;pregio&quot; started being unetymologically pronounced and as well.

In present-day Italian, a few early English loanwords are pronounced according to Italian spelling rules such as &quot;water&quot; (&quot;toilet bowl,&quot; from English &quot;water (closet)&quot;), pronounced , and &quot;&quot;, pronounced . The Italian word &quot;ovest&quot; (&quot;west&quot;) comes from a spelling pronunciation of French &quot;ouest&quot; (which, in turn, is a phonetic transcription of English &quot;west&quot;); that particular instance of spelling pronunciation must have occurred before the 16th century, when the letters u and v were still indistinct.

A few foreign proper names are normally pronounced according to the pronunciation of the original language (or a close approximation of it), but they retain an older spelling pronunciation when they are used as parts of Italian street names. For example, the name of Edward Jenner retains its usual English pronunciation in most contexts, but &quot;Viale Edoardo Jenner&quot; (a main street in Milan) is pronounced . The use of such old-fashioned spelling pronunciations was probably encouraged by the custom of translating given names when streets were named after foreign people: &quot;Edoardo&quot; for &quot;Edward&quot;, or &quot;Giorgio&quot; for &quot;George&quot; for &quot;Via Giorgio Washington.&quot;

In Spanish, the ch in some German words is pronounced or , instead of . Bach is pronounced , and Kuchen is , but Rorschach is , rather than , Mach is or , and Kirchner is or . Other spelling pronunciations are club pronounced , iceberg pronounced in Spain (in the Americas, it is pronounced ), and &quot;folclor&quot; and &quot;folclore&quot; as translations of folklore, pronounced and . Also in Spanish, the acute accent in the French word &quot;élite&quot; is taken as a Spanish stress mark, and the word is pronounced .

When Slavic languages like Polish or Czech borrow words from English with their spelling preserved, the pronunciation tends to follow the rules of the receiving language. Words such as &quot;marketing&quot; are pronounced as spelled, instead of the more phonetically faithful .

In standard Finnish, the sound /d/ developed as a spelling pronunciation for the letter &quot;d&quot;, though it originally represented a /ð/ sound. Similarly, /ts/ in words like &quot;metsä&quot; (forest) is a pronunciation spelling of &quot;tz&quot; used in pre-1770s orthography, which originally represented a long /θ/ sound. The dental fricatives had become rare by the 1700s, when the standard pronunciations started to develop into their current forms, which became official in the 1800s. The /d/ sound, however, is not present in most dialects and is generally replaced by a /r/, /l/ or simply dropped (e.g. &quot;lähde&quot; &quot;water spring&quot; may be pronounced as &quot;lähre&quot;, &quot;lähle&quot; or &quot;lähe&quot;). Standard &quot;ts&quot; is often replaced with &quot;tt&quot; or &quot;ht&quot; (&quot;mettä&quot;, &quot;mehtä&quot;).

In Vietnamese, initial v is often pronounced like a y () in the central and southern varieties. However, in formal speech, speakers often revert to the spelling pronunciation, which is increasingly being used in casual speech as well.

Chinese has a similar phenomenon called &quot;youbian dubian&quot; where unfamiliar characters may be read with the pronunciation of similar characters that feature the same phonetic component. For instance, the character is rarely used in Chinese but is often used in Japanese place names (where it is pronounced &quot;chō&quot;). When read in Mandarin Chinese, it came to be pronounced &quot;dīng&quot; (such as in Ximending, a district in Taipei that was named during Japanese occupation) in analogy with the character (also pronounced &quot;dīng&quot;), even though its expected etymological reflex is &quot;tǐng&quot;.

In Welsh the word is traditionally pronounced with either a or , depending on dialect, in the final syllable – i.e. . The pronunciation is a spelling pronunciation, the spelling was settled on so as not to give preference to any particular dialect. A similar situation occurred with the word which is usually pronounced or but many younger and second-language learners pronounce it as spelt: .

<text>Thomas Otten Paine (November 9, 1921 – May 4, 1992) was an American engineer, scientist and advocate of space exploration, and was the third Administrator of NASA, serving from March 21, 1969, to September 15, 1970.

During his administration at NASA, the first crewed lunar landing by Apollo 11 was flown as were three other Apollo missions. Paine was also deeply involved in preparing plans for the post-Apollo era at NASA.

==Early life and education==
Born in Berkeley, California, Paine attended public schools in various cities and graduated from Brown University in 1942 with an A.B. degree in engineering. At Brown, Paine joined Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In World War II, he served as a submarine officer in the Pacific and in the subsequent Japanese occupation. In late 1945, Paine became the executive officer of the prize crew which sailed the Japanese aircraft-carrying submarine &quot;I-400&quot; from Japan to Pearl Harbor. He qualified as a Navy deep-sea diver and was awarded the Commendation Medal and Submarine Combat Insignia with stars. From 1946 to 1949, Paine attended Stanford University, receiving an M.S. degree in 1947 and Ph.D. degree in 1949 in physical metallurgy. During his career, Paine received honorary Sc.D. degrees from Brown, Clarkson College of Technology, Nebraska Wesleyan University, the University of New Brunswick, Oklahoma City University, and an honorary D.Eng. degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

==Career==
===Research scientist===
====Stanford University====
Paine began his career as a research associate at Stanford University from 1947 to 1949, where he made basic studies of high-temperature alloys and liquid metals in support of naval nuclear reactor programs.

====General Electric====
Paine joined the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, New York, in 1949 as a research associate, where he started research programs on magnetic and composite materials. In 1951, Paine transferred to the Meter and Instrument Department of G.E. in Lynn, Massachusetts, as the manager of materials development, and later as a laboratory manager. Under Paine&#x27;s management, this lab received the Award for Outstanding Contribution to Industrial Science in 1956 from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for its work in fine-particle magnet development. From 1958 through 1962, Paine was a research associate and manager of Engineering Applications at the Research and Development Center of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y., From 1963 to 1968, Paine was manager of TEMPO, the Center for Advanced Studies of General Electric located in Santa Barbara, California.

===NASA Administrator===
Paine was appointed Deputy Administrator of NASA on January 31, 1968. Upon the retirement of James E. Webb on October 8, 1968, he was named Acting Administrator of NASA. He was nominated as NASA&#x27;s third Administrator on March 5, 1969, and confirmed by the Senate on March 20, 1969.

Paine was recruited to succeed Webb by President Lyndon Johnson. He was tasked with the responsibility of getting the Apollo program back on track in the wake of the Apollo 1 disaster, and fulfilling President Kennedy&#x27;s goal &quot;before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.&quot;

During his administration at NASA, the first seven Apollo missions were flown, highlighted by the first human lunar landing by Apollo 11. In all, 20 astronauts orbited Earth, 24 traveled to the Moon, and 12 walked upon its surface. Many automated scientific and applications spacecraft were also flown in U.S. and cooperative international programs.

Paine was also deeply involved in preparing plans for the post-Apollo era at NASA. Along with George Mueller and others, Paine developed an ambitious plan calling for the establishment of a lunar base and a massive space station in Earth orbit before the end of the 1970s, culminating in a crewed mission to Mars as early as 1981. President Richard Nixon rejected these plans, however.

He was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.

====Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages====
Paine was instrumental in acquiring the sentiments of world leaders that became the Apollo 11 Goodwill Messages which now rests on the lunar surface. He personally corresponded with the heads of what became seventy-three participating nations, and coordinated the efforts to enshrine their messages on a tiny silicon disc manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company of North Adams, Massachusetts. Paine&#x27;s name is also etched onto the disc.

Paine proposed the idea of the messages to the State Department&#x27;s Under Secretary for Political Affairs U. Alexis Johnson. A high level committee determined that a plaque declaring that &quot;We Came in Peace for all Mankind&quot; and the planting of a U.S. flag on the Moon were to be part of the ceremonial activities for Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface.

===Post-NASA===
====General Electric====
Paine resigned from NASA September 15, 1970, to return to the General Electric Co. in New York City as vice president and group executive, Power Generation Group (worldwide ship propulsion, nuclear power, and steam and gas turbine generators), and later became senior vice president for science and technology (oversight of GE&#x27;s research and development).

====Northrop corporation====
Paine left GE in 1976 to become the president and chief operating officer of Northrop Corporation, where he also served as a director. Paine retired as president of Northrop in 1982.

====National Commission on Space====

On October 12, 1984, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12490 that commissioned a panel of experts to investigate and evaluate the future of the national space program. President Ronald Reagan appointed Paine to be the chairman of this investigation. Rather than naming the commission after himself, as is customary, he chose instead to name it &quot;The National Commission on Space&quot;. Members of the 15-member commission included Dr. Luis Alvarez (a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics), Neil Armstrong (NASA astronaut and the first man on the Moon), Dr. Gerard K. O&#x27;Neill (American physicist and space activist), Dr. Kathryn D. Sullivan (Space Shuttle astronaut and first American woman to walk in space), Dr. Jeane Kirkpatrick (political scientist and former United States Ambassador to the United Nations) and Brigadier General Charles E. &quot;Chuck&quot; Yeager (rocket plane pilot and first man to break the sound barrier).

Since leaving NASA fifteen years earlier, Paine had been a vocal spokesman for an expansive future of Space exploration. The National Commission on Space took most of a year to prepare its report, conducting public hearings throughout the United States. The Commission report, &quot;Pioneering the Space Frontier&quot;, was published in May 1986. It espoused &quot;a pioneering mission for 21st-century America... to lead the exploration and development of the space frontier, advancing science, technology, and enterprise, and building institutions and systems that make accessible vast new resources and support human settlements beyond Earth orbit, from the highlands of the Moon to the plains of Mars.&quot; The report also contained a &quot;Declaration for Space&quot; that included a rationale for exploring and settling the solar system and outlined a long-range space program for the United States.

====Thomas O. Paine Associates====
In 1982, Paine established Thomas Paine Associates - High Technology Enterprises (TPA) in Westwood, CA, and relocated it in Santa Monica, CA, in 1986. TPA also housed Paine&#x27;s 3400-volume Submarine Warfare Library, which was later donated to the Nimitz Library, U.S. Naval Academy.

====Corporate directorships====
Paine served as a director for many corporations, including the RCA, NBC, Eastern Air Lines, Nike, Arthur D. Little, Inc., Orbital Sciences, and Quotron Systems (a division of the Citicorp company). Paine also served as a Director of the Planetary Society, the National Space Institute, the International Academy of Astronautics, and the Pacific Forum CSIS Honolulu Hawaii. The Planetary Society honored his commitment to Mars by establishing The Thomas O. Paine Award for the Advancement of Human Exploration of Mars.

====University trustee====
Paine also served as a Trustee of Occidental College and Brown University and was a member of the National Academy of Engineering.

==Personal life==
Paine was married to Barbara Helen Taunton Pearse of Perth, Australia. They had four children: Marguerite Ada, George Thomas, Judith Janet, and Frank Taunton.

Paine died of cancer at his home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 4, 1992, at the age of 70.

In 1972, Paine donated his papers to the Library of Congress, where they are currently open and available in the Manuscript Division. Although there is one container of classified material, the other 183 are open and available to researchers.

==In media==
In the 1966 BBC TV &quot;Panorama&quot; documentary &quot;California 2000&quot;, Paine was interviewed and offered predictions on how technology will impact society.

In the 1995 movie &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, Paine is played by Joe Spano. In the 1996 TV movie &quot;Apollo 11&quot;, he is played by Carmen Argenziano. In the 1998 TV miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, he is played by Sam Anderson.

A fictionalized Thomas O. Paine is depicted in the 2019 alternate history web television series &quot;For All Mankind&quot;. The name of the show is inspired by the inscription on the Apollo 11 lunar plaque Paine was instrumental in bringing about. In the show&#x27;s setting, Paine stays on as NASA administrator until Nixon loses re-election to Ted Kennedy in 1972. He is then brought back by Reagan when elected in 1976 and remains NASA administrator until killed in the 1983 Korean Air Lines Flight 007 incident. In the show Paine is played by Dan Donohue.

<text>Tonawanda Creek is a small tributary of the Niagara River in Western New York, United States. After rising in Wyoming County, the stream flows through Genesee County before forming part of the boundary between Erie County and Niagara County.

==Description==
The length of Tonawanda Creek is . Its drainage basin is nearly in area. It flows on a meandering course for most of its length, first northerly until reaching the City of Batavia where a sweeping bend takes it westerly.

Tonawanda Creek rises in Wyoming County and enters the Niagara River between Niagara County and Erie County, forming a boundary between them. Tonawanda Creek passes through the Village of Attica, the City of Batavia, flows between the City of North Tonawanda to its north and the Town of Amherst to its south, the Town of Clarence, the Town of Tonawanda, and the City of Tonawanda. Just after being joined by Ellicott Creek, it enters the Niagara River.

The creek has a small waterfall at Indian Falls where the stream descends from the Onondaga Escarpment.

During the spring of each year, some sections of Tonawanda Creek flood to varying degrees. These floods are more of an inconvenience than a danger, but can be more serious, especially when ice jams dam up the water. The larger flooding can cause property damage.

Tonawanda Creek is also part of the Erie Canal, which joins the creek southwest of Lockport and allows canal traffic to proceed into the Niagara River. In its upper reaches, Tonawanda Creek and the Little Tonawanda, which is a tributary, are trout streams.

==History==

The name Tonawanda (&quot;&quot;) or (&quot;″&quot;) derives from the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) language meaning swift water.

Tonawanda Creek flows through the ancient lake bed of Glacial Lake Tonawanda, a prehistoric lake that existed approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age; many of the swamp lands surrounding Tonawanda Creek also date back to this lake.

Downstream of Indian Falls, Tonawanda Creek flows through the Tonawanda Indian Reservation, and this is where George Washington made a troop fording across the stream.

When the Erie Canal was first built, the Tonawanda Creek was the source of water for the western section of the Canal.
