<text>Manchuria is a region in East Asia. Depending on the definition of its extent, Manchuria can refer either to a region falling entirely within present-day China, or to a larger region today divided between Northeast China and the Russian Far East. To differentiate between the two parts following the latter definition, the Russian part is also known as Outer Manchuria (or Russian Manchuria), while the Chinese part is known as Northeast China.

Manchuria is the homeland of the Manchu people. &quot;Manchu&quot; is a name introduced by Hong Taiji of the Qing dynasty in 1636 for the Jurchen people, a Tungusic people.

The population grew from about 1 million in 1750 to 5 million in 1850 and to 14 million in 1900, largely because of the immigration of Han farmers.

Lying at the juncture of the Chinese, Japanese and Russian spheres of influence, Manchuria has been a hotbed of conflict since the late-19th century. The Russian Empire established control over the northern part of Manchuria in 1860 (Beijing Treaty); it built (1897–1902) the Chinese Eastern Railway to consolidate its control. Disputes over Manchuria and Korea led to the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. The Japanese invaded Manchuria in 1931, setting up the puppet state of Manchukuo which became a centerpiece of the fast-growing Empire of Japan. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August 1945 led to the rapid collapse of Japanese rule, and the Soviets restored the region of Manchuria to Chinese rule: Manchuria served as a base of operations for the Mao Zedong&#x27;s People&#x27;s Liberation Army in the Chinese Civil War, which led to the formation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949. In the Korean War of 1950–1953, Chinese forces used Manchuria as a base to assist North Korea against the United Nations Command forces. During the Sino–Soviet split Manchuria became a matter of contention, escalating to the Sino–Soviet border conflict in 1969. The Sino-Russian border dispute was resolved diplomatically only in 2004.

In recent years scholars have studied 20th-century Manchuria extensively, while paying less attention to the earlier period.

== Prehistory ==
Neolithic sites located in the region of Manchuria are represented by the Xinglongwa culture, Xinle culture and Hongshan culture.

==Early history==

===Antiquity to Tang dynasty===

The earliest documented residents in what later became known as Manchuria were the Sushen, Donghu and Gojoseon peoples. Around 300 BC, the state of Yan expanded into what is now Liaoning province, establishing the commanderies of Liaoxi and Liaodong.

After the fall of Yan, the region was successively ruled by the Qin, Han, and Jin dynasties and then various Xianbei states during the Sixteen Kingdoms era. Meanwhile, the kingdoms of Buyeo and Goguryeo were established to the north, at times controlling large territories of the region.

Manchuria was the homeland of several Tungusic ethnic groups, including the Ulchs and Nani. Various ethnic groups and their respective kingdoms, including the Xianbei, Wuhuan, Mohe and Khitan have risen to power in Manchuria.

=== Balhae ===
From 698 to 926, the kingdom of Bohai ruled over all of Manchuria, including the northern Korean peninsula and Primorsky Krai. Balhae was composed predominantly of Goguryeo language and Tungusic-speaking peoples (Mohe people), and was an early feudal medieval state of Eastern Asia, which developed its industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and had its own cultural traditions and art. People of Balhae maintained political, economic and cultural contacts with both Silla and the Tang dynasty, as well as Japan.

Northeastern Manchuria in today&#x27;s Primorsky Krai was settled at this moment by northern Mohe tribes. It was incorporated to the Balhae Kingdom under King Seon&#x27;s reign (818–830) and put Balhae territory at its height. After subduing the &quot;Yulou Mohe&quot; (Hanzi: pinyin: ) first and the &quot;Yuexi Mohe&quot; (Hanzi: pinyin: ) thereafter, King Seon administered their territories by creating four prefectures : Solbin Prefecture (率宾府), Jeongli Prefecture (定理府), Anbyeon Prefecture (安邊府) and Anwon Prefecture (安遠府).

===Liao and Jin dynasties===

With the Song dynasty to the south, the Khitan people of Western Manchuria, who probably spoke a language related to the Mongolic languages, created the Liao dynasty in Inner and Outer Mongolia and conquered the region of Manchuria, and went on to control the adjacent part of the Sixteen Prefectures in Northern China as well.

In the early 12th century the Tungusic Jurchen people (the ancestors of the later Manchu people), who originally lived in the forests in the eastern borderlands of the Liao Empire and were Liao&#x27;s tributaries, overthrew the Liao and formed the Jin dynasty. They went on to control parts of Northern China and Mongolia after a series of successful military campaigns. Most of the surviving Khitan either assimilated into the bulk of the Han and Jurchen populations, or moved to Central Asia. However, according to DNA tests conducted by Liu Fengzhu of the Nationalities Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Daur people, still living in northern Manchuria (northeast China 东北), are also descendants of the Khitans.

The first Jin capital, Shangjing, located on the Ashi River within modern Harbin, was originally not much more than a city of tents, but in 1124 the second Jin emperor Wanyan Wuqimai starting a major construction project, had his ethnic Han chief architect, Lu Yanlun, build a new city at this site, emulating, on a smaller scale, the Northern Song capital Bianjing (Kaifeng). When Bianjing fell to Jin troops in 1127, thousands of captured Song aristocrats (including the two Song emperors), scholars, craftsmen and entertainers, along with the treasures of the Song capital, were all taken to Shangjing (the Upper Capital) by the winners.

Although the Jin ruler Wanyan Liang, spurred on by his aspirations to become the ruler of a unified China, moved the Jin capital from Shangjing to Yanjing (now Beijing) in 1153, and had the Shangjing palaces destroyed in 1157, the city regained a degree of significance under Wanyan Liang&#x27;s successor, Emperor Shizong, who enjoyed visiting the region to get in touch with his Jurchen roots.

The capital of the Jin, Zhongdu, was captured by the Mongols in 1215 at the Battle of Zhongdu. The Jin then moved their capital to Kaifeng, which fell to Mongols in 1233. In 1234, the Jin dynasty collapsed after the siege of Caizhou. The last emperor of the Jin, Emperor Mo, was killed while fighting the Mongols who had breached the walls of the city. Days earlier, his predecessor, Emperor Aizong, committed suicide because he was unable to escape the besieged city.

===Mongols and the Yuan dynasty===
In 1211, after the conquest of Western Xia, Genghis Khan mobilized an army to conquer the Jin dynasty. His general Jebe and brother Qasar were ordered to reduce the Jurchen cities in Manchuria. They successfully destroyed the Jin forts there. The Khitans under Yelü Liuge declared their allegiance to Genghis Khan and established the nominally autonomous Eastern Liao dynasty in Manchuria in 1213. However, the Jin forces dispatched a punitive expedition against them. Jebe went there again and the Mongols pushed out the Jins.

The Jin general, Puxian Wannu, rebelled against the Jin dynasty and founded the kingdom of Eastern Xia in Dongjing (Liaoyang) in 1215. He assumed the title Tianwang (; lit. Heavenly King) and the era name Tiantai (). Puxian Wannu allied with the Mongols in order to secure his position. However, he revolted in 1222 after that and fled to an island while the Mongol army invaded Liaoxi, Liaodong, and Khorazm. As a result of an internal strife among the Khitans, they failed to accept Yelü Liuge&#x27;s rule and revolted against the Mongol Empire. Fearing of the Mongol pressure, those Khitans fled to Goryeo without permission. But they were defeated by the Mongol-Korean alliance. Genghis Khan (1206–1227) gave his brothers and Muqali Chinese districts in Manchuria.

Ögedei Khan&#x27;s son Güyük crushed the Eastern Xia dynasty in 1233, pacifying southern Manchuria. Some time after 1234 Ögedei also subdued the Tungusic peoples in northern part of the region and began to receive falcons, harems and furs as taxation. The Mongols suppressed the Tungus rebellion in 1237. In Manchuria and Siberia, the Mongols used dogsled relays for their yam. The capital city Karakorum directly controlled Manchuria until the 1260s.

During the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), established by Kublai Khan by renaming his empire to &quot;Great Yuan&quot; in 1271, Manchuria was administered under the Liaoyang province. Descendants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brothers such as Belgutei and Hasar ruled the area under the Great Khans. The Mongols eagerly adopted new artillery and technologies. The world&#x27;s earliest known firearm is the Heilongjiang hand cannon, dated 1288, which was found in Mongol-held Manchuria.

After the expulsion of the Mongols from China proper, the Jurchen clans remained loyal to Toghan Temür, the last Yuan emperor. In 1375, Naghachu, a Mongol commander of the Northern Yuan dynasty in Liaoyang province invaded Liaodong with aims of restoring the Mongols to power. Although he continued to hold southern Manchuria, Naghachu finally surrendered to the Ming dynasty in 1387. In order to protect the northern border areas the Ming decided to &quot;pacify&quot; the Jurchens in order to deal with its problems with Yuan remnants along its northern border. The Ming solidified control only under Yongle Emperor (1402–1424).

===Ming dynasty===
The Ming dynasty took control of Liaoning in 1371, just three years after the expulsion of the Mongols from Beijing. During the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century, efforts were made to expand Chinese control throughout entire Manchuria by establishing the Nurgan Regional Military Commission. Mighty river fleets were built in Jilin City, and sailed several times between 1409 and ca. 1432, commanded by the eunuch Yishiha down the Songhua and the Amur all the way to the mouth of the Amur, getting the chieftains of the local tribes to swear allegiance to the Ming rulers.

Soon after the death of the Yongle Emperor the expansion policy of the Ming was replaced with that of retrenchment in southern Manchuria (Liaodong). Around 1442, a defence wall was constructed to defend the northwestern frontier of Liaodong from a possible threat from the Jurchen-Mongol Oriyanghan. In 1467–68 the wall was expanded to protect the region from the northeast as well, against attacks from Jianzhou Jurchens. Although similar in purpose to the Great Wall of China, this &quot;Liaodong Wall&quot; was of a simpler design. While stones and tiles were used in some parts, most of the wall was in fact simply an earthen dike with moats on both sides.

Chinese cultural and religious influence such as Chinese New Year, the &quot;Chinese god&quot;, Chinese motifs like the dragon, spirals, scrolls, and material goods like agriculture, husbandry, heating, iron cooking pots, silk, and cotton spread among the Amur natives like the Udeghes, Ulchis, and Nanais.

Starting in the 1580s, a Jianzhou Jurchens chieftain Nurhaci (1558–1626), originally based in the Hurha River valley northeast of the Ming Liaodong Wall, started to unify Jurchen tribes of the region. Over the next several decades, the Jurchen (later to be called Manchu), took control over most of Manchuria, the cities of the Ming Liaodong falling to the Jurchen one after another. In 1616, Nurhaci declared himself a khan, and founded the Later Jin dynasty (which his successors renamed in 1636 to Qing dynasty).

===Qing dynasty===


The process of unification of the Jurchen people completed by Nurhaci was followed by his son&#x27;s, Hong Taiji, energetic expansion into what became Outer Manchuria. The conquest of the Amur basin people was completed after the defeat of the Evenk chief Bombogor, in 1640.

In 1644, the Qing dynasty took Beijing and went on to conquer all of China proper. As the ancestral land of the Qing rulers, Manchuria was accorded a special status within the Qing Empire. The Eight Banners system involved military units originated in Manchuria and was used as a form of government.

During the Qing dynasty, the area of Manchuria was known as the &quot;three eastern provinces&quot; (東三省, dong san sheng) since 1683 when Jilin and Heilongjiang were separated even though it was not until 1907 that they were turned into actual provinces. The area of Manchuria was then converted into three provinces by the late Qing government in 1907.

For decades the Qing rulers tried to prevent large-scale immigration of Han people, but they failed and the southern parts developed agricultural and social patterns similar to those of North China. Manchuria&#x27;s population grew from about 1 million in 1750 to 5 million in 1850 and 14 million in 1900, largely because of the immigration of Han farmers. The Manchus became a small element in their homeland, although they retained political control until 1900.

The region was separated from China proper by the Inner Willow Palisade, a ditch and embankment planted with willows intended to restrict the movement of the Han people into Manchuria during the Qing dynasty, as the area was off-limits to the Han until the Qing started colonizing the area with them later on in the dynasty&#x27;s rule. This movement of the Han people to Manchuria is called Chuang Guandong. The Manchu area was still separated from modern-day Inner Mongolia by the Outer Willow Palisade, which kept the Manchu and the Mongols separate.

However, the Qing rule saw a massive increase of Han settlement, both legal and illegal, in Manchuria. As Manchu landlords needed the Han peasants to rent their land and grow grain, most Han migrants were not evicted. During the 18th century, Han peasants farmed 500,000 hectares of privately owned land in Manchuria and 203,583 hectares of lands which were part of courier stations, noble estates, and banner lands, in garrisons and towns in Manchuria the Han people made up 80% of the population. Han farmers were resettled from north China by the Qing to the area along the Liao River in order to restore the land to cultivation.

To the north, the boundary with Russian Siberia was fixed by the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) as running along the watershed of the Stanovoy Mountains. South of the Stanovoy Mountains, the basin of the Amur and its tributaries belonged to the Qing Empire. North of the Stanovoy Mountains, the Uda Valley and Siberia belonged to the Russian Empire. In 1858, a weakening Qing Empire was forced to cede Manchuria north of the Amur to Russia under the Treaty of Aigun; however, Qing subjects were allowed to continue to reside, under the Qing authority, in a small region on the now-Russian side of the river, known as the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River.

In 1860, at the Convention of Peking, the Russians managed to annex a further large slice of Manchuria, east of the Ussuri River. As a result, Manchuria was divided into a Russian half known as Outer Manchuria, and a remaining Chinese half known as Manchuria. In modern literature, &quot;Manchuria&quot; usually refers to the Chinese part of Manchuria. (cf. Inner and Outer Mongolia). As a result of the Treaties of Aigun and Peking, China lost access to the Sea of Japan. The Qing government began to actively encourage Han subjects to move into Manchuria since then.

The Manza War in 1868 was the first attempt by Russia to expel Chinese subjects of various ethnicities from territory it controlled. Hostilities broke out around Vladivostok when the Russians tried to shut off gold mining operations and expel Chinese workers there. The Chinese resisted a Russian attempt to take Askold Island and in response, 2 Russian military stations and 3 Russian towns were attacked by the Chinese, and the Russians failed to oust the Chinese. However, the Russians finally managed it from them in 1892

==History after 1860==
By the 19th century, along with other frontier territories of the Qing dynasty such as Mongolia and Tibet, Manchuria came under the influence of Japan and the European powers as the Qing dynasty grew weaker.

===Russian and Japanese encroachment===


Manchuria also came under strong Russian influence with the building of the Chinese Eastern Railway through Harbin to Vladivostok. Some poor Korean farmers moved there. In Chuang Guandong many Han farmers, mostly from Shandong peninsula moved there, attracted by cheap farmland that was ideal for growing soybeans.

During the Boxer Rebellion in 1899–1900, Russian soldiers killed ten thousand Chinese (Manchu, Han and Daur peoples) living in Blagoveshchensk and Sixty-Four Villages East of the River. In revenge, the Chinese Honghuzi conducted guerilla warfare against the Russian occupation of Manchuria and sided with Japan against Russia during the Russo-Japanese War.

Japan replaced Russian influence in the southern half of Manchuria as a result of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905. Most of the southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway (the section from Changchun to Port Arthur (Japanese: Ryojun) was transferred from Russia to Japan, and became the South Manchurian Railway. Jiandao (in the region bordering Korea), was handed over to Qing dynasty as a compensation for the South Manchurian Railway.

From 1911 to 1931 Manchuria was nominally part of the Republic of China. In practice it was under Japan domination, which exerted influence through local warlords.

Japanese influence extended into Outer Manchuria in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917, but Outer Manchuria came under Soviet control by 1925. Japan took advantage of the disorder following the Russian Revolution to occupy Outer Manchuria, but Soviet successes and American economic pressure forced Japanese withdrawal.

In the 1920s Harbin was flooded with 100,000 to 200,000 Russian white émigrés fleeing from Russia. Harbin held the largest Russian population outside of the state of Russia.

It was reported that among Banner people, both Manchu and Han in Aihun, Heilongjiang in the 1920s, would seldom marry with Han civilians, but they (Manchu and Han Bannermen) would mostly intermarry with each other. Owen Lattimore reported that, during his January 1930 visit to Manchuria, he studied a community in Jilin (Kirin), where both Manchu and Han bannermen were settled at a town called Wulakai, and eventually the Han Bannermen there could not be differentiated from Manchus since they were effectively Manchufied. The Han civilian population was in the process of absorbing and mixing with them when Lattimore wrote his article.

Manchuria was (and still is) an important region for its rich mineral and coal reserves, and its soil is perfect for soy and barley production. For Japan, Manchuria became an essential source of raw materials.

===Korean invasion of Manchuria===
When Russian troops captured Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion, Korea saw this as an opportunity to settle its border disputes with the Qing by invading Manchuria. South of the Tumen River, Korea established Jinwidae. A police force. Korea sent a battalion of 150 soldiers to Jongseung, 200 to Musan County, 200 to Hoeryong, 100 more to Jongseung, 100 to Onsong County and 50 to Kyongwon County. Jinwidae&#x27;s border defenses were so tight that the Qing officials could not control the Koreans. When police forces were stationed in Jiandao, the purpose of Jinwidae was changed to border protection.

The police station was established in March 1901. Two hundred policemen were stationed in Jiandao. The police station divided Jiandao into five subdivisions: North Jiandao, Jongseong Jiandao, Hoeryong Jiandao, Musan Jiandao, and Gyeongwon Jiandao. In 1902, Korea sent Yi Bum-yun to Jiandao as an observer to strengthen its control over the area.

Realizing it was impossible to protect the Koreans without force, Yi raised a volunteer army. From September 1903, Yi began to build up an armed force, digging extensive trenches between Bongcheon (now Shenyang), Manchuria, Jilin, and Jiandao. He employed Russian instructors to train the army and bought 500 rifles from Seoul. The Korean government supported Yi&#x27;s volunteer army because of Gojong&#x27;s desire to control Jiandao and Yi Yong-ik&#x27;s support. According to a Qing official, the violence of the Korean army was as follows. On 4 September 1903, 1,000 Korean soldiers crossed the Yalu River. These Korean soldiers burned and looted Chinese territory across the Yalu River. On 2 October 1903, 700-800 Korean soldiers broke into a county office in Linjiang. To avoid further conflict with China, the Korean government summoned Yi in 1904. Yi refused to obey the Korean government&#x27;s order and instead led his troops to Primorsky Krai, where he joined many Korean independence activists such as Choe Jae-hyeong and An Jung-geun.

After the invasion, the Koreans began to regard Jiandao as Korean territory. For example, the 1907 map of Korea included Jiandao as Korean territory. However, in the early 20th century the Empire of Japan gained increasing influence in Korea, and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 deprived Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty and gave full authority over all aspects of Korea&#x27;s foreign relations to the Japanese Foreign Office. Professor Yi Tae-jin of Seoul University claimed that the Koreans regarded the Japanese interference as an invasion because the Japanese and Russians were fighting in the Russo-Japanese War. When Japan began interfering in the Manchuria border, the Korean Daily News which once referred to Jiandao as Korean territory changed its position. The dispute ended with the Gando Convention (signed by China and Japan in 1909), which recognized the Chinese claim to Jiandao (Gando). Korea was annexed by Japan in the following year with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910.

===1931 Japanese invasion and Manchukuo===
Around the time of World War I, Zhang Zuolin, a former bandit (&quot;Honghuzi&quot;) established himself as a powerful warlord with influence over most of Manchuria. He was inclined to keep his army under his control and to keep Manchuria free of foreign influence. The Japanese tried and failed to assassinate him in 1916. They finally succeeded in June 1928.

Following the Mukden Incident in 1931 and the subsequent Japanese invasion of Manchuria, Manchuria was proclaimed to be Manchukuo, a puppet state under the control of the Japanese army. The last Qing emperor, Puyi, was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet government in the Wei Huang Gong, better known as &quot;Puppet Emperor&#x27;s Palace&quot;. Manchuria was thus detached from China by Japan to create a buffer zone to defend Japan from Russia&#x27;s Southing Strategy and, with Japanese investment and rich natural resources, became an industrial domination. Under Japanese control Manchuria was one of the most brutally run regions in the world, with a systematic campaign of terror and intimidation against the local Russian and Chinese populations including arrests, organised riots and other forms of subjugation. The Japanese also began a campaign of emigration to Manchukuo; the Japanese population there rose from 240,000 in 1931 to 837,000 in 1939 (the Japanese had a plan to bring in 5 million Japanese settlers into
Manchukuo). Hundreds of Manchu farmers were evicted and their farms given to Japanese immigrant families. Manchukuo was used as a base to invade the rest of China in 1937–40.

At the end of the 1930s, Manchuria was a trouble spot with Japan, clashing twice with the Soviet Union. These clashes - at Lake Khasan in 1938 and at Khalkhin Gol one year later - resulted in many Japanese casualties. The Soviet Union won these two battles and a peace agreement was signed. However, the regional unrest endured.

===After World War II===
After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded from Soviet Outer Manchuria as part of its declaration of war against Japan. From 1945 to 1948, Manchuria was a base area for the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army in the Chinese Civil War. With the encouragement of the Soviet Union, Manchuria was used as a staging ground during the Chinese Civil War for the Chinese Communist Party, which emerged victorious in 1949.

During the Korean War of the 1950s, 300,000 soldiers of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army crossed the Sino-Korean border from Manchuria to repulse UN forces led by the United States from North Korea.

In the 1960s, Manchuria&#x27;s border with the Soviet Union became the site of the most serious tension between the Soviet Union and China. The treaties of 1858 and 1860, which ceded territory north of the Amur, were ambiguous as to which course of the river was the boundary. This ambiguity led to dispute over the political status of several islands. This led to armed conflict in 1969, called the Sino-Soviet border conflict.

With the end of the Cold War, this boundary issue was discussed through negotiations. In 2004, Russia agreed to transfer Yinlong Island and one half of Heixiazi Island to China, ending an enduring border dispute. Both islands are found at the confluence of the Amur and Ussuri Rivers, and were until then administered by Russia and claimed by China. The event was meant to foster feelings of reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries by their leaders, but it has also provoked different degrees of dissent on both sides. Russians, especially Cossack farmers of Khabarovsk, who would lose their ploughlands on the islands, were unhappy about the apparent loss of territory. Meanwhile, some Chinese have criticised the treaty as an official acknowledgement of the legitimacy of Russian rule over Outer Manchuria, which was ceded by the Qing dynasty to Imperial Russia under a series of what the Chinese side called &quot;Unequal Treaties&quot;, which included the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Convention of Peking in 1860, in order to exchange exclusive usage of Russia&#x27;s rich oil resources. The transfer was carried out on October 14, 2008.

<text>In mathematics, the Koszul complex was first introduced to define a cohomology theory for Lie algebras, by Jean-Louis Koszul (see Lie algebra cohomology). It turned out to be a useful general construction in homological algebra. As a tool, its homology can be used to tell when a set of elements of a (local) ring is an M-regular sequence, and hence it can be used to prove basic facts about the depth of a module or ideal which is an algebraic notion of dimension that is related to but different from the geometric notion of Krull dimension. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the complex is the complex of syzygies, that is, it tells you the relations between generators of a module, the relations between these relations, and so forth.

== Definition == 
Let &quot;A&quot; be a commutative ring and &quot;s: Ar → A&quot; an &quot;A&quot;-linear map. Its Koszul complex &quot;Ks&quot; is
:formula_1
where the maps send
:formula_2
where formula_3 means the term is omitted and formula_4 means the wedge product. One may replace formula_5 with any &quot;A&quot;-module.

== Motivating example ==
Let &quot;M&quot; be a manifold, variety, scheme, ..., and &quot;A&quot; be the ring of functions on it, denoted formula_6.

The map formula_7 corresponds to picking &quot;r&quot; functions formula_8. When &quot;r = 1&quot;, the Koszul complex is
:formula_9
whose cokernel is the ring of functions on the zero locus &quot;f = 0&quot;. In general, the Koszul complex is
:formula_10
The cokernel of the last map is again functions on the zero locus formula_11. It is the tensor product of the &quot;r&quot; many Koszul complexes for formula_12, so its dimensions are given by binomial coefficients. 

In pictures: given functions formula_13, how do we define the locus where they all vanish?

In algebraic geometry, the ring of functions of the zero locus is formula_14. In &quot;derived&quot; algebraic geometry, the &quot;dg&quot; ring of functions is the Koszul complex. If the loci formula_15 intersect transversely, these are equivalent. 

Thus: Koszul complexes are &quot;derived intersections&quot; of zero loci.

== Properties ==

=== Algebra structure ===
First, the Koszul complex &quot;Ks&quot; of &quot;(A,s)&quot; is a chain complex: the composition of any two maps is zero. Second, the map 
:formula_16
makes it into a dg algebra.

=== As a tensor product ===
The Koszul complex is a tensor product: if formula_17, then
:formula_18
where formula_19 denotes the derived tensor product of chain complexes of &quot;A&quot;-modules. 

=== Vanishing in regular case ===
When formula_20 form a regular sequence, the map formula_21 is a quasi-isomorphism, i.e. 
:formula_22
and as for any &quot;s&quot;, formula_23.

== History ==
The Koszul complex was first introduced to define a cohomology theory for Lie algebras, by Jean-Louis Koszul (see Lie algebra cohomology). It turned out to be a useful general construction in homological algebra. As a tool, its homology can be used to tell when a set of elements of a (local) ring is an M-regular sequence, and hence it can be used to prove basic facts about the depth of a module or ideal which is an algebraic notion of dimension that is related to but different from the geometric notion of Krull dimension. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the complex is the complex of syzygies, that is, it tells you the relations between generators of a module, the relations between these relations, and so forth.

== Detailed Definition ==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a commutative ring and &quot;E&quot; a free module of finite rank &quot;r&quot; over &quot;R&quot;. We write formula_24 for the &quot;i&quot;-th exterior power of &quot;E&quot;. Then, given an &quot;R&quot;-linear map formula_25,
the Koszul complex associated to &quot;s&quot; is the chain complex of &quot;R&quot;-modules:
:formula_26,
where the differential formula_27 is given by: for any formula_28 in &quot;E&quot;,
:formula_29.
The superscript formula_30 means the term is omitted. To show that formula_31, use the self-duality of a Koszul complex.

Note that formula_32 and formula_33. Note also that formula_34; this isomorphism is not canonical (for example, a choice of a volume form in differential geometry provides an example of such an isomorphism).

If formula_35 (i.e., an ordered basis is chosen), then, giving an &quot;R&quot;-linear map formula_36 amounts to giving a finite sequence formula_20 of elements in &quot;R&quot; (namely, a row vector) and then one sets formula_38

If &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-module, then one sets:
:formula_39,
which is again a chain complex with the induced differential formula_40. 

The &quot;i&quot;-th homology of the Koszul complex
:formula_41
is called the &quot;i&quot;-th Koszul homology. For example, if formula_35 and formula_43 is a row vector with entries in &quot;R&quot;, then formula_44 is
:formula_45
and so
:formula_46
Similarly,
:formula_47

===Koszul complexes in low dimensions===
Given a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, an element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, and an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot;, the multiplication by &quot;x&quot; yields a homomorphism of &quot;R&quot;-modules,
:formula_48
Considering this as a chain complex (by putting them in degree 1 and 0, and adding zeros elsewhere), it is denoted by formula_49. By construction, the homologies are
:formula_50
the annihilator of &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.
Thus, the Koszul complex and its homology encode fundamental properties of the multiplication by &quot;x&quot;. This chain complex formula_51 is called the Koszul complex of &quot;R&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot;, as in #Definition.
The Koszul complex for a pair formula_52 is 
:formula_53
with the matrices formula_54 and formula_55 given by

:formula_56 and
:formula_57
Note that formula_58 is applied on the right. The cycles in degree 1 are then exactly the linear relations on the elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, while the boundaries are the trivial relations. The first Koszul homology formula_59 therefore measures exactly the relations mod the trivial relations. With more elements the higher-dimensional Koszul homologies measure the higher-level versions of this.

In the case that the elements formula_60 form a regular sequence, the higher homology modules of the Koszul complex are all zero.

==Example==
If &quot;k&quot; is a field and formula_61 are indeterminates and &quot;R&quot; is the polynomial ring formula_62, the Koszul complex formula_63 on the formula_64&#x27;s forms a concrete free &quot;R&quot;-resolution of &quot;k&quot;.

== Properties of a Koszul homology ==
Let &quot;E&quot; be a finite-rank free module over &quot;R&quot;, let formula_65 be an &quot;R&quot;-linear map, and let &quot;t&quot; be an element of &quot;R&quot;. Let formula_66 be the Koszul complex of formula_67.

Using formula_68,
there is the exact sequence of complexes:
:formula_69,
where formula_70 signifies the degree shift by formula_71 and formula_72. One notes: for formula_73 in formula_74,
:formula_75
In the language of homological algebra, the above means that formula_66 is the mapping cone of formula_77.

Taking the long exact sequence of homologies, we obtain:
:formula_78
Here, the connecting homomorphism
:formula_79
is computed as follows. By definition, formula_80 where &quot;y&quot; is an element of formula_66 that maps to &quot;x&quot;. Since formula_66 is a direct sum, we can simply take &quot;y&quot; to be (0, &quot;x&quot;). Then the early formula for formula_83 gives formula_84.

The above exact sequence can be used to prove the following.

Proof by induction on &quot;r&quot;. If &quot;formula_85&quot;, then formula_86. Next, assume the assertion is true for &quot;r&quot; - 1. Then, using the above exact sequence, one sees formula_87 for any formula_88. The vanishing is also valid for formula_89, since formula_90 is a nonzerodivisor on formula_91 formula_92
Proof: By the theorem applied to &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S&quot; as an &quot;S&quot;-module, we see that formula_93 is an &quot;S&quot;-free resolution of formula_94. So, by definition, the &quot;i&quot;-th homology of formula_95 is the right-hand side of the above. On the other hand, formula_96 by the definition of the &quot;S&quot;-module structure on &quot;M&quot;. formula_92
Proof: Let &quot;S&quot; = &quot;R&quot;[&quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;n&quot;]. Turn &quot;M&quot; into an &quot;S&quot;-module through the ring homomorphism &quot;S&quot; → &quot;R&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; → &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot; and &quot;R&quot; an &quot;S&quot;-module through . By the preceding corollary, formula_98 and then
:formula_99 formula_92

For a local ring, the converse of the theorem holds. More generally,

Proof: We only need to show 2. implies 1., the rest being clear. We argue by induction on &quot;r&quot;. The case &quot;r&quot; = 1 is already known. Let &quot;x″&quot; denote &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;r&quot;-1. Consider
:formula_101
Since the first formula_90 is surjective, formula_103 with formula_104. By Nakayama&#x27;s lemma, formula_105 and so &quot;x″&quot; is a regular sequence by the inductive hypothesis. Since the second formula_90 is injective (i.e., is a nonzerodivisor), formula_107 is a regular sequence. (Note: by Nakayama&#x27;s lemma, the requirement formula_108 is automatic.) formula_92

== Tensor products of Koszul complexes ==
In general, if &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; are chain complexes, then their tensor product formula_110 is the chain complex given by

:formula_111
with the differential: for any homogeneous elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;,
:formula_112
where |&quot;x&quot;| is the degree of &quot;x&quot;.

This construction applies in particular to Koszul complexes. Let &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; be finite-rank free modules, and let formula_113 and formula_114 be two &quot;R&quot;-linear maps. Let formula_66 be the Koszul complex of the linear map formula_116. Then, as complexes,
:formula_117
To see this, it is more convenient to work with an exterior algebra (as opposed to exterior powers). Define the graded derivation of degree formula_71
:formula_119
by requiring: for any homogeneous elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in Λ&quot;E&quot;,
*formula_120 when formula_121
*formula_122
One easily sees that formula_123 (induction on degree) and that the action of formula_124 on homogeneous elements agrees with the differentials in #Definition.

Now, we have formula_125 as graded &quot;R&quot;-modules. Also, by the definition of a tensor product mentioned in the beginning,
:formula_126
Since formula_127 and formula_83 are derivations of the same type, this implies formula_129

Note, in particular,
:formula_130.

The next proposition shows how the Koszul complex of elements encodes some information about sequences in the ideal generated by them.
Proof: (Easy but omitted for now)

As an application, we can show the depth-sensitivity of a Koszul homology. Given a finitely generated module &quot;M&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot;, by (one) definition, the depth of &quot;M&quot; with respect to an ideal &quot;I&quot; is the supremum of the lengths of all regular sequences of elements of &quot;I&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. It is denoted by formula_131. Recall that an &quot;M&quot;-regular sequence &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; in an ideal &quot;I&quot; is maximal if &quot;I&quot; contains no nonzerodivisor on formula_132.

The Koszul homology gives a very useful characterization of a depth.
Proof: To lighten the notations, we write H(-) for H(&quot;K&quot;(-)). Let &quot;y&quot;1, ..., &quot;y&quot;&quot;s&quot; be a maximal &quot;M&quot;-regular sequence in the ideal &quot;I&quot;; we denote this sequence by formula_133. First we show, by induction on formula_134, the claim that formula_135 is formula_136 if formula_137 and is zero if formula_138. The basic case formula_139 is clear from #Properties of a Koszul homology. From the long exact sequence of Koszul homologies and the inductive hypothesis,
:formula_140,
which is
formula_141 Also, by the same argument, the vanishing holds for formula_138. This completes the proof of the claim.

Now, it follows from the claim and the early proposition that formula_143 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot; - &quot;s&quot;. To conclude &quot;n&quot; - &quot;s&quot; = &quot;m&quot;, it remains to show that it is nonzero if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;n&quot; - &quot;s&quot;. Since formula_133 is a maximal &quot;M&quot;-regular sequence in &quot;I&quot;, the ideal &quot;I&quot; is contained in the set of all zerodivisors on formula_145, the finite union of the associated primes of the module. Thus, by prime avoidance, there is some nonzero &quot;v&quot; in formula_145 such that formula_147, which is to say,
:formula_148 formula_92

== Self-duality ==
There is an approach to a Koszul complex that uses a cochain complex instead of a chain complex. As it turns out, this results essentially in the same complex (the fact known as the self-duality of a Koszul complex).

Let &quot;E&quot; be a free module of finite rank &quot;r&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot;. Then each element &quot;e&quot; of &quot;E&quot; gives rise to the exterior left-multiplication by &quot;e&quot;:
:formula_150
Since formula_151, we have: formula_152; that is,
:formula_153
is a cochain complex of free modules. This complex, also called a Koszul complex, is a complex used in . Taking the dual, there is the complex:
:formula_154.
Using an isomorphism formula_155, the complex formula_156 coincides with the Koszul complex in the definition.

==Use==

The Koszul complex is essential in defining the joint spectrum of a tuple of commuting bounded linear operators in a Banach space.

<text>The lists and tables below summarize and compare the letter inventories of some of the Latin-script alphabets. In this article, the scope of the word &quot;alphabet&quot; is broadened to include letters with tone marks, and other diacritics used to represent a wide range of orthographic traditions, without regard to whether or how they are sequenced in their alphabet or the table.

Parentheses indicate characters not used in modern standard orthographies of the languages, but used in obsolete and/or dialectal forms.

==Letters contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet==
=== Alphabets that contain only ISO basic Latin letters ===

Among alphabets for natural languages the English,[36] Indonesian, and Malay alphabets only use the 26 letters in both cases.

Among alphabets for constructed languages the Ido and Interlingua alphabets only use the 26 letters, while Toki Pona uses a 14-letter subset.

==== Extended by ligatures ====

* German (ß), Scandinavian (æ)

==== Extended by diacritical marks ====

* Spanish (ñ), German (ä, ö, and ü)

==== Extended by multigraphs ====

* Filipino (ng)

===Alphabets that contain all ISO basic Latin letters===
Among alphabets for natural languages the Afrikaans,[54] Aromanian, Azerbaijani (some dialects)[53], Basque,[4], Celtic British, Catalan,[6] Cornish, Czech,[8] Danish,[9] Dutch,[10] Emilian-Romagnol, Filipino,[11] Finnish, French,[12], German,[13] Greenlandic, Hungarian,[15] Javanese, Karakalpak,[23] Kurdish, Modern Latin, Luxembourgish, Norwegian,[9] Oromo[65], Papiamento[63], Polish[22], Portuguese, Quechua, Rhaeto-Romance, Romanian, Slovak,[24] Spanish,[25] Sundanese, Swedish, Tswana,[52] Uyghur, Venda,[51] Võro, Walloon,[27] West Frisian, Xhosa, Zhuang, Zulu alphabets include all 26 letters, &quot;at least&quot; in their largest version.

Among alphabets for constructed languages the Interglossa and Occidental alphabets include all 26 letters.

The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) includes all 26 letters in their lowercase forms, although &quot;g&quot; is always single-storey (&quot;ɡ&quot;) in the IPA and never double-storey ().

===Alphabets that do not contain all ISO basic Latin letters===
This list is based on official definitions of each alphabet. However, excluded letters might occur in non-integrated loan words and place names.
The I is used in two distinct versions in Turkic languages: dotless (I ı) and dotted (İ i). They are considered different letters, and case conversion must take care to preserve the distinction. Irish traditionally does not write the dot, or tittle, over the small letter &quot;i&quot;, but the language makes no distinction here if a dot is displayed, so no specific encoding and special case conversion rule is needed as it is for Turkic alphabets.

====Statistics====
The chart above lists a variety of alphabets that do not officially contain all 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet. In this list, one letter is used by all of them: A. For each of the 26 basic ISO Latin alphabet letters, the number of alphabets in the list above using it is as follows:
==Letters not contained in the ISO basic Latin alphabet==
Some languages have extended the Latin alphabet with ligatures, modified letters, or digraphs. These symbols are listed below. 

===Additional letters by type===

====Independent letters and ligatures====
====Letter–diacritic combinations: connected or overlaid====
===Other letters in collation order===
The tables below are a work in progress. Eventually, table cells with light blue shading will indicate letter forms that do not constitute distinct letters in their associated alphabets. Please help with this task if you have the required linguistic knowledge and technical editing skill.

For the order in which the characters are sorted in each alphabet, see collating sequence.

===Notes===
# ↑↑↑↑ In classical Latin, the digraphs , , , were used in loanwords from Greek, but they were not included in the alphabet. The ligatures , and , as well as lowercase letters, were added to the alphabet only in Middle Ages. The letters and were used as typographical variants of and , respectively, roughly until the Enlightenment.
# ↑↑↑↑ In Afrikaans, and are only (and and almost only) used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Albanian officially has the digraphs , which is sufficient to represent the Tosk dialect. The Gheg dialect supplements the official alphabet with 6 nasal vowels, namely .
# ↑↑↑↑ Arbëresh officially has the digraphs . Arbëresh has the distinctive , which is considered as a letter in its own right.
# ↑↑ Achomi also has the digraph .
# ↑↑↑↑ Azeri only uses the letter as a substitute for if the latter cannot be used (it was replaced by the schwa one year later because it is the most common letter). These cases should be avoided! The letters , , , , (or the digraph ), and the digraph are only used in certain dialects.
# ↑ Bambara also has the digraphs: (only present in loanwords), (also written as ; only present in some dialects). Historically, was used instead of , was used instead of , and was used instead of in Mali.
# ↑↑↑↑ Basque has several digraphs: . The , which represents , is required for various words in its Zuberoan dialect. are used in foreign words, but are officially considered part of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ Belarusian also has several digraphs: .
# ↑↑↑↑ Bislama also has the digraph .
# ↑↑↑↑ Breton also has the digraphs . are used in foreign words or digraphs only.
# ↑↑↑ Catalan also has a large number of digraphs: . The letters are only used in loanwords or the digraphs mentioned.
# ↑↑ The Alphabet of Chad also uses the unique letters and .
# ↑↑↑ Chamorro also has the digraphs . used only in digraphs.
# ↑↑↑↑ Corsican has the trigraphs: .
# ↑↑↑↑↑↑↑↑ Croatian Gaj&#x27;s alphabet also has the digraphs: . There are also four tone markers that are sometimes used on vowels to avoid ambiguity in homophones, but this is generally uncommon. Gaj&#x27;s alphabet has been adopted by the Serbian and Bosnian standards and that it has complete one-to-one congruence with Serbian Cyrillic, where the three digraphs map to Cyrillic letters , and , respectively. Rarely and non-standardly, digraph is used instead of (like it was previously) (Cyrillic ). Montenegrin variant additionally uses and to indicate dialectal pronunciation.
# ↑↑ Cypriot Arabic also has the letters and .
# ↑↑↑↑ Czech also has the digraph , which is considered a separate letter and is sorted between and . While are considered separate letters, in collation they are treated merely as letters with diacritics. However, are sorted as separate letters. occur only in loanwords.
# ↑ Dakelh also contains the letter , which represents the glottal stop. The letters are only used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑↑↑ The Norwegian alphabet is currently identical with the Danish alphabet. is part of both alphabets and is not used in native Danish or Norwegian words (except some proper names), but occurs quite frequently in well-established loanwords in Danish. Norwegian and Danish use in some words such as , although is considered a diacritic mark, while are letters. are not used except for names and some foreign words.
# ↑ Dinka also has the digraphs: . is only present in these digraphs. Dinka also used the letters (the last two which do not exist as precomposed characters in Unicode)
# ↑↑↑ The status of as a letter, ligature or digraph in Dutch is disputed. (outside the digraph ), , , and occur mostly in foreign words. Letters with grave and letters with circumflex occur only in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑ English generally now uses extended Latin letters only in loan words, such as &quot;fiancé&quot;, &quot;fiancée&quot;, and &quot;résumé&quot;. Rare publication guides may still use the dieresis on words, such as &quot;coöperate&quot;, rather than the now-more-common &quot;co-operate&quot; (UK) or &quot;cooperate&quot; (US). For a fuller discussion, see articles branching from Lists of English words of international origin, which was used to determine the diacritics needed for more unambiguous English. However, an or is sometimes used in poetry to show that a normally silent vowel is to be pronounced, as in &quot;blessèd&quot;.
# ↑↑↑↑ Filipino [and also applicable in or to Tagalog, which is the topmost influencer and contributor language of Filipino, among the rest of the other influencer and contributor languages of the Philippines and foreign languages for Filipino&#x27;s evolution, further development, and further enrichment; it (Tagalog) is also the de facto historical, traditional, and linguistic basis of Filipino and the de jure or official basis of Filipino&#x27;s both predecessor Philippine national and official language/s or language phase/s or stage/s since 1937 (as a national language) and 1946 (as an official language), which is lastly institutionally, officially, and constitutionally named or renamed as or into Pilipino from 1959 to 1987, before being constitutionally and officially replaced by Filipino as the national and an official language since 1987] also uses the digraph , even originally with a large tilde that spanned both and (as in ) when a vowel follows the digraph. (The use of the tilde over the two letters is now rare). Only is required for everyday use (only in loanwords). The accented vowels are used in dictionaries to indicate pronunciation, and with tilde is only present in older works. and are new variants of and , respectively, and we&#x27;re introduced in 2013 by the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (Commission on the Filipino Language)&#x27;s &quot;Ortograpiyang Pambansa&quot; (National Orthography) and in 2014 by the Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino (Commission on the Filipino Language)&#x27;s KWF Manwal sa Masinop na Pagsulat (KWF Manual on Provident Writing) to represent and preserve the schwa vowel sound /ə/ in non-Tagalog Filipino words of Philippine origin or from the other languages of the Philippines that natively have this vowel sound in their languages. 
# ↑↑↑ Uppercase diacritics in French are often (incorrectly) thought of as being optional, but the official rules of French orthography designate accents on uppercase letters as obligatory in most cases. Many pairs or triplets are read as digraphs or trigraphs depending on context, but are not treated as such lexicographically: consonants ; vocal vowels ; nasal vowels ; the half-consonant --; half-consonant and vowel pairs . When rules that govern the French orthography are not observed, they are read as separate letters, or using an approximating phonology of a foreign language for loan words, and there are many exceptions. In addition, most final consonants are mute (including those consonants that are part of feminine, plural, and conjugation endings). and are only used in certain geographical names and proper names plus their derivatives, or, in the case of with diaeresis, newly proposed reforms, e.g. &#x27;shambles&#x27; is derived from the proper name Capharnaüm. occurs only in Latin or Greek loanwords.
# ↑ Fula has as part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (used only in loanwords in these countries). , which is used only in loanwords (but still part of the alphabet), is used in Guinea only. Fula also uses the digraphs (In Guinea spelled ), . are part of the alphabet in all countries except Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. is used in all countries except for Nigeria, where it is written . is used in all countries except for Nigeria. is used in Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso, is used in Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the digraph is used in Niger, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, and Nigeria. The apostrophe is a letter (representing the glottal stop) in Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. are only used in loanwords, and are not part of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ Galician. The standard of 1982 set also the digraphs &quot;gu&quot;, &quot;qu&quot; (both always before and ), &quot;ch, ll, nh&quot; and &quot;rr&quot;. In addition, the standard of 2003 added the grapheme as an alternative writing of . Although not marked (or forgotten) in the list of digraphs, they are used to represent the same sound, so the sequence should be considered as a digraph. The sequence represents a velar nasal (not a palatal as in Portuguese) and is restricted only to three feminine words, being either demonstrative or pronoun: (&#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;one&#x27;), (&#x27;some&#x27;) and (&#x27;not one&#x27;). The Galician &quot;reintegracionismo&quot; movement uses it as in Portuguese. (outside of the Limia Baixa region), , , and are only used in loanwords, and are not part of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ German also retains most original letters in French loan words. Swiss German does not use any more. The long s was in use until the mid-20th century. is usually not considered a separate letter, neither are the digraphs . only appears in the sequence and in loanwords, while and are found almost only in loan words. The capital () is almost never used. The accented letters (other than the letters , , , and ) are used only in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Guaraní also uses digraphs and the glottal stop . are only used in these digraphs.
# ↑ Gwich&#x27;in also contains the letter , which represents the glottal stop. Gwich&#x27;in also uses the letters , which are not available as precomposed characters in Unicode. Gwich&#x27;in also uses the digraphs and trigraphs: . The letter is only used the digraphs above. are only used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Hausa has the digraphs: . Vowel length and tone are usually not marked. Textbooks usually use macron or doubled vowel to mark the length, grave to mark the low tone and circumflex to mark the falling tone. Therefore, in some systems, it is possible that macron is used in combination with grave or circumflex over a, e, i, o or u. The letter is only used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Hungarian also has the digraphs: ; and the trigraph: . are considered separate letters, but are collated as variants of .
# ↑↑↑↑ Irish traditionally used the dot diacritic () to mark lenition, forming the dotted letters ( &quot;struck letters&quot;) . These have largely been replaced by the digraphs: except for in decorative or self-consciously traditional contexts. occurs in a small number of (mainly onomatopoeic) native words (e.g. &quot;to quack&quot;) and colloquialisms ( for &quot;screw&quot;). only occur in loanwords and scientific terminology.
# ↑ Igbo writes alternatively as . Igbo has the digraphs: . is only used in the digraph before. Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone.
# ↑↑↑↑ Italian also has the digraphs: . are used in foreign words, and are not part of the alphabet. is also used for native words derived from Latin and Greek; is also used for just a few native words, mainly names of persons (as in Jacopo) or of places (as in Jesolo and Jesi), in which represents . While it does not occur in ordinary running texts, geographical names on maps are often written only with acute accents. The circumflex is used on an -i ending that was anciently written -ii (or -ji, -ij, -j, etc.) to distinguish homograph plurals and verb forms: e.g. form , from .
# ↑ Karakalpak also has the digraphs: . are used in foreign words.
# ↑ Kazakh also has the digraphs: . and the digraph are used in foreign words.
# ↑↑↑↑ Latvian also has the digraphs: . &quot;Dz&quot; and &quot;dž&quot; are occasionally considered separate letters of the alphabet in more archaic examples, which have been published as recently as the 1950s; however, modern alphabets and teachings discourage this due to an ongoing effort to set decisive rules for Latvian and eliminate barbaric words accumulated during the Soviet occupation. The digraph &quot;ie&quot; is never considered a separate letter. &quot;Ō&quot;, &quot;Ŗ&quot;, and the digraphs &quot;CH&quot; (only used in loanwords) and &quot;UO&quot; are no longer part of the alphabet, but are still used in certain dialects and newspapers that use the old orthography. &quot;Y&quot; is used only in certain dialects and not in the standard language. &quot;F&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are only used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ A nearby language, Pite Sami, uses Lule Sami orthography but also includes the letters and , which are not in Lule Sami.
# ↑↑↑↑ Lithuanian also has the digraphs: . However, these are not considered separate letters of the alphabet. &quot;F&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, and the digraph &quot;CH&quot; are only used in loanwords. Demanding publications such as dictionaries, maps, schoolbooks etc. need additional diacritical marks to differentiate homographs. Using grave accent on A, E, I, O, U, acute accent on all vowels, and tilde accent on all vowels and on L, M, N and R. Small E and I (also with ogonek) must retain the dot when additional accent mark is added to the character; the use of ì and í (with missing dot) is considered unacceptable.
# ↑↑↑↑ In Livonian, the letters &quot;Ö, Ȫ, Y, Ȳ&quot; were used by the older generation, but the younger generation merged these sounds; Around the late 1990s, these letters were removed from the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ Maltese also has the digraphs: .
# ↑ Māori only uses in digraph. is also a digraph.
# ↑↑↑↑ Marshallese often uses the old orthography (because people did not approve of the new orthography), which writes &quot;ļ&quot; as l, &quot;m̧&quot; as m, &quot;ņ&quot; as n, &quot;p&quot; as b, &quot;o̧&quot; as o at the ends of words or in the word &quot;yokwe&quot; (also spelled iakwe under the old orthography; under the new orthography, spelled io̧kwe), but a at other places, and &quot;d&quot; as dr before vowels, or r after vowels. The old orthography writes &quot;ā&quot; as e in some words, but ā in others; it also writes &quot;ū&quot; as i between consonants. The old orthography writes geminates and long vowels as two letters instead. Allophones of , written as only e o ō in the new orthography, are also written as i u and very rarely, ū. The letter &quot;Y&quot; only occurs in the words &quot;yokwe&quot; or the phrase &quot;yokwe yuk&quot; (also spelled iakwe iuk in the old orthography or io̧kwe eok in the new orthography).
# ↑↑↑ Massachusett also uses the digraphs and the letter (which was previously written ). is only used in the digraph .
# ↑ Some Mohawk speakers use orthographic in place of the consonant . The glottal stop is indicated with an apostrophe and long vowels are written with a colon .
# ↑ Na&#x27;vi uses the letter &quot;ʼ&quot; and the digraphs &quot;aw&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, &quot;ew&quot;, &quot;ey&quot;, &quot;kx&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ng&quot; (sometimes written ), &quot;px&quot;, &quot;rr&quot;, &quot;ts&quot; (sometimes written ), &quot;tx&quot;. (in standard orthography) and are used only in digraphs.
# ↑ Oromo uses the following digraphs: . is only used in the digraph and loanwords. and are only used in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Papiamento also has the digraphs: . are only used in loanwords and proper names. is only used in digraphs, loanwords, and proper names. Papiamentu in Bonaire and Curaçao is different from Papiamento in Aruba in the following ways: Papiamento in Aruba uses a more etymological spelling, so Papiamento uses in native words outside of the digraph , but Papiamentu in Bonaire and Curaçao does not. Papiamentu in Bonaire and Curaçao uses , , , and for various sounds and for stress, but Papiamento in Aruba does not use these letters.
# ↑ Piedmontese also uses the letter , which usually precedes a vowel, as in &quot;moon&quot;.
# ↑↑↑↑ Pinyin has four tone markers that can go on top of any of the six vowels (); e.g.: macron (), acute accent (), caron (), grave accent (). It also uses the digraphs: .
# ↑↑↑↑ Polish also has the digraphs: . occur only in loanwords, and are sometimes not considered as part of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ Portuguese uses the digraphs . The trema on was used in Brazilian Portuguese from 1943 to 2009. European Portuguese in that case used the grave accent () from 1911 to 1945, then abolished. The grave accent was used on , until 1973. are used in geographical names outside Europe and not part of the language proper. The now abandoned practice was to indicate underlying stress in words ending in , e.g. , etc. Neither the digraphs nor accented letters are considered part of the alphabet. occur only in loanwords, and were not letters of the alphabet until 2009, but these letters were used before 1911.
# ↑↑↑↑ Romani has the digraphs: .
# ↑ Romanian normally uses the letters ( with a comma diacritic below) but they are frequently replaced by ( with a cedilla) due to past lack of standardization. occur only in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑ Slovak also has the digraphs which are considered separate letters. While are considered separate letters, in collation they are treated merely as letters with diacritics. However, , as well as the digraphs, are actually sorted as separate letters. occur only in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑↑ Sorbian also uses the digraphs: , . is only used in Upper Sorbian, and , , and (outside the digraph ) are only used in Lower Sorbian.
# ↑↑↑ Spanish uses several digraphs to represent single sounds: , (preceding or ), , , ; of these, the digraphs and were traditionally considered individual letters with their own name (, ) and place in the alphabet (after and , respectively), but in order to facilitate international compatibility the Royal Spanish Academy decided to cease this practice in 1994 and all digraphs are now collated as combinations of two separate characters. While cedilla is etymologically Spanish diminutive of ceda () and Sancho Pança is the original form in Cervantes books, C with cedilla is now completely displaced by in contemporary language. In poetry, the diaeresis may be used to break a diphthong into separate vowels. Regarding that usage, Ortografía de la lengua española states that &quot;diaeresis is usually placed over the closed vowel [i.e. or ] and, when both are closed, generally over the first&quot;. In this context, the use of is rare, but part of the normative orthography.
# ↑ Swedish uses in well integrated loan words like and , although is considered a modified , while , , are letters. and are rarely used words. and are used in some integrated words like webb and . , , , and are used for names only, but exist in Swedish names. For foreign names , , and more are sometimes used, but usually not. Swedish has many digraphs and some trigraphs. and others are usually pronounced as one sound.
# ↑↑↑↑ Tswana also has the digraphs: . The letters , , and only appear in onomatopoeic and loanwords. The letters and only appear in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Turkmen had a slightly different alphabet in 1993–1995 (which used some rare letters) was written as (capital ), as , as (capital ), and as (capital ) (so that all characters were available in Code page 437). In the new alphabet, all characters are available in ISO/IEC 8859-2.
# ↑↑↑ Ulithian also has the digraphs: . is used only in digraphs.
# ↑ Uzbek also has the digraphs: considered as letters. is used only in digraphs. , and apostrophe are considered as letters. These letters have preferred typographical variants: , , and respectively.
# ↑↑↑↑ Venda also has the digraphs and trigraphs: . are used in foreign words.
# ↑↑↑↑ Vietnamese has seven additional base letters: . It uses five tone markers that can go on top (or below) any of the 12 vowels (); e.g.: grave accent (), hook above (), tilde (), acute accent (), and dot below (). It also uses several digraphs and trigraphs but they are no longer considered letters.
# ↑↑↑↑ Walloon has the digraphs and trigraphs: . The letter outside the digraph is in some orthographies, but not the default two. The letter is in some orthographies, but not in the default two. Also in some orthographies are , , , and even and (which are not available as a precomposed character in Unicode, so and are used as substitutes)
# ↑↑↑↑ Welsh has the digraphs , , , , , , , . Each of these digraphs is collated as a separate letter, and comes immediately after in the alphabet. It also frequently uses circumflexes, and occasionally uses diaereses, acute accents and grave accents, on its seven vowels (), but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑↑ Xhosa has a large number of digraphs, trigraphs, and even one tetragraph are used to represent various phonemes: . It also occasionally uses acute accents, grave accents, circumflexes, and diaereses on its five vowels (), but accented characters are not regarded as separate letters of the alphabet.
# ↑↑↑ Yapese has the digraphs and trigraphs: . , representing the glottal stop, is not always used. Often an apostrophe is used to represent the glottal stop instead. is used only in digraphs. is used only in digraphs and loanwords. is used only in loanwords.
# ↑↑↑↑ Yoruba uses the digraph . Also, vowels take a grave accent, an acute accent, or no accent, depending on tone. Although the &quot;dot below&quot; diacritic is widely used, purists prefer a short vertical underbar (Unicode COMBINING VERTICAL LINE BELOW U+0329) - this resembles the IPA notation for a syllabic consonant, attached to the base of the letter (, or ). The seven Yoruba vowels (, , , , , , ) can be uttered in three different tones: high (acute accent); middle (no accent) and low (grave accent). The letters and , when written without diacritics, indicate nasalisation of the preceding vowel. and also occur as syllabics - in these circumstances, they take acute or grave tonal diacritics, like the vowels. Middle tone is marked with a macron to differentiate it from the unmarked nasalising consonants. A tilde was used in older orthography (still occasionally used) to indicate a double vowel. This is tonally ambiguous, and has now been replaced by showing the paired vowels, each marked with the appropriate tones. However, where a double vowel has the tonal sequence high-low or low-high, it may optionally be replaced by a single vowel with a circumflex (high-low) or caron (low-high), e.g. á + à = ; à + á = .
# ↑↑ Zuni contains the glottal stop and the digraph: ; is only used in that digraph. The other digraphs , , and are not part of the alphabet.

<text>Sinterklaas () or Sint-Nicolaas () is a legendary figure based on Saint Nicholas, patron saint of children. Other Dutch names for the figure include &quot;De Sint&quot; (&quot;The Saint&quot;), &quot;De Goede Sint&quot; (&quot;The Good Saint&quot;) and &quot;De Goedheiligman&quot; (&quot;The Good Holy Man&quot;). Many descendants and cognates of &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; or &quot;Saint Nicholas&quot; in other languages are also used in the Low Countries, nearby regions, and former Dutch colonies.

The feast of Sinterklaas celebrates the name day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December. The Sinterklaas feast is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on St. Nicholas&#x27; Eve (5 December) in the Netherlands and on the morning of Saint Nicholas Day (6 December) in Belgium, Luxembourg, western Germany, and northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine, Alsace and Artois). The tradition is also celebrated in some territories of the former Dutch Empire, including Aruba.

Sinterklaas is one of the sources of the popular Christmas icon of Santa Claus.

==Figures==
===Sinterklaas===
&quot;Sinterklaas&quot; is based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas (270–343), a Greek bishop of Myra in present-day Turkey. He is depicted as an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or chasuble over a traditional white bishop&#x27;s alb and a sometimes-red stole, dons a red mitre and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured crosier, a long ceremonial shepherd&#x27;s staff with a fancy curled top.

He traditionally rides a white horse. In the Netherlands, the televised Sinterklaas specials have named the horse. Until 2019, Sinterklaas rode Amerigo, who was &quot;pensioned&quot; (i.e., died) and replaced with a horse called Ozosnel (&quot;oh so fast&quot;), after a passage in a well-known Sinterklaas song. In Belgium, the horse is named &quot;Slecht weer vandaag&quot;, meaning &quot;bad weather today&quot; or &quot;Mooi weer vandaag&quot; (&quot;nice weather today&quot;).

Sinterklaas carries a big, red book which traditionally records whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year.

===Zwarte Piet===
Sinterklaas is assisted by &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; (&quot;Black Pete&quot;), a helper dressed in Moorish attire and in a black painted face. Zwarte Piet first appeared in print as the nameless servant of Saint Nicholas in &quot;Sint-Nikolaas en zijn knecht&quot; (&quot;St. Nicholas and His Servant&quot;), published in 1850 by Amsterdam schoolteacher Jan Schenkman; however, the tradition appears to date back at least as far as the early 19th century. Zwarte Piet&#x27;s colourful dress is based on 16th-century noble attire, with a ruff (lace collar) and a feathered cap. He is typically depicted carrying a bag which contains candy for the children, which he tosses around, a tradition supposedly originating in the story of Saint Nicholas saving three young girls from prostitution by tossing golden coins through their window at night to pay their dowries.

Traditionally, he would also carry a birch rod (Dutch: &quot;roe&quot;), a chimney sweep&#x27;s broom made of willow branches, used to spank children who had been naughty. Some of the older Sinterklaas songs make mention of naughty children being put in Zwarte Piet&#x27;s bag and being taken back to Spain. This part of the legend refers to the times that the Moors raided the European coasts, and as far as Iceland, to abduct the local people into slavery. This quality can be found in other companions of Saint Nicholas such as Krampus and Père Fouettard. In modern versions of the Sinterklaas feast, however, Zwarte Piet no longer carries the &quot;roe&quot; and children are no longer told that they will be taken back to Spain in Zwarte Piet&#x27;s bag if they have been naughty.

Over the years many stories have been added, and Zwarte Piet has developed into a valuable assistant to the absent-minded saint. In modern adaptations for television, Sinterklaas has developed a Zwarte Piet for every function, such as a Head Piet (&quot;Hoofdpiet&quot;), a Navigation Piet (&quot;Wegwijspiet&quot;) to navigate the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands, a Presents Piet (&quot;Pakjespiet&quot;) to wrap all the gifts, and Acrobatic Piet to climb roofs and chimneys. Traditionally Zwarte Piet&#x27;s face is said to be black because he is a Moor from Spain. Today, some children are told that his face is blackened with soot because he has to climb through chimneys to deliver gifts for Sinterklaas.
Since the 2010s, the traditions surrounding the holiday of Sinterklaas have been the subject of a growing number of editorials, debates, documentaries, protests and even violent clashes at festivals. In most cities and television channels now only display Zwarte Piet characters with some soot smudges on the face rather than full blackface, so-called &quot;roetveegpieten&quot; (&quot;soot-smudge Petes&quot;) or &quot;schoorsteenpieten&quot; (&quot;chimney Petes&quot;). 
In a 2013 survey, 92 per cent of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist or associate him with slavery, and 91 per cent were opposed to altering the character&#x27;s appearance. In a similar survey in 2018, between 80 and 88 per cent of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist, and between 41 and 54 per cent were happy with the character&#x27;s modernised appearance (a mix of &quot;roetveegpieten&quot; and blackface).
A June 2020 survey saw a drop in support for leaving the character&#x27;s appearance unaltered: 47 per cent of those surveyed supported the traditional appearance, compared to 71 per cent in a similar survey held in November 2019. Prime Minister Mark Rutte stated in a parliamentary debate on 5 June 2020 that he had changed his opinion on the issue and now has more understanding for people who consider the character&#x27;s appearance to be racist.

== Celebration ==

In the Netherlands, Sinterklaas is a very popular tradition. The festival is celebrated by a wide range of people including Dutch Jews and Muslims, and by generally all age groups. However, a 2023 survey showed that most are &quot;less keen&quot; to celebrate following the controversy surrounding &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot;.

=== Arrival from Spain ===

The festivities traditionally begin each year in mid-November (the first Saturday after 11 November), when Sinterklaas &quot;arrives&quot; by a steamboat at a designated seaside town, supposedly from Spain. In the Netherlands this takes place in a different port each year, whereas in Belgium it always takes place in the city of Antwerp. The steamboat anchors, then Sinterklaas disembarks and parades through the streets on his horse, welcomed by children cheering and singing traditional Sinterklaas songs. His &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; assistants throw candy and small, round, gingerbread-like cookies, either &quot;kruidnoten&quot; or &quot;pepernoten&quot;, into the crowd. The event is broadcast live on national television in the Netherlands and Belgium.

Following this national arrival, other towns celebrate their own &quot;intocht van Sinterklaas&quot; (arrival of Sinterklaas). Local arrivals usually take place later on the same Saturday of the national arrival, the next day (Sunday), or one weekend after the national arrival. In places a boat cannot reach, Sinterklaas arrives by train, horse, horse-drawn carriage or even a fire truck.

Sinterklaas is said to come from Spain, possibly because in 1087, half of Saint Nicholas&#x27; relics were transported to the Italian city of Bari, which later formed part of the Spanish Kingdom of Naples. Others suggest that mandarin oranges, traditionally gifts associated with St. Nicholas, led to the misconception that he must have been from Spain. This theory is backed by a Dutch poem documented in 1810 in New York and provided with an English translation:

&lt;poem&gt;Saint Nicholas, good holy man!
Put on the Tabard, best you can,
Go, therewith, to Amsterdam,

The text presented here comes from a pamphlet that John Pintard released in New York in 1810. It is the earliest source mentioning Spain in connection to &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;. Pintard wanted St. Nicholas to become patron saint of New York and hoped to establish a &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; tradition. Apparently he got help from the Dutch community in New York, that provided him with the original Dutch &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; poem. Strictly speaking, the poem does not state that Sinterklaas &quot;comes&quot; from Spain, but that he needs to &quot;go&quot; to Spain to pick up the oranges and pomegranates. So the link between Sinterklaas and Spain goes through the oranges, a much appreciated treat in the 19th century. Later the connection with the oranges got lost, and Spain became his home. Traditionally, the city of origin of the steamboat has been the port city of Alicante (Spain). This could be based on the fact that Alicante&#x27;s patron is Saint Nicholas, and that the city&#x27;s cathedral is dedicated to this saint. The province of Alicante is also famous for its oranges.

=== Period leading up to Saint Nicholas&#x27; Eve ===

In the weeks between his arrival and 5 December, Sinterklaas visits schools, hospitals, and shopping centres. He is said to ride his white-grey horse over the rooftops at night, delivering gifts through the chimney to the well-behaved children. Traditionally, naughty children risked being caught by Black Pete, who carried a jute bag and willow cane for that purpose.

Before going to bed, children each leave a single shoe next to the fireplace chimney of the coal-fired stove or fireplace (or in modern times close to the central heating radiator, or a door). They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it and a bowl of water nearby &quot;for Sinterklaas&#x27; horse&quot;, and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes.

Typical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include mandarin oranges, &quot;pepernoten&quot;, &quot;speculaas&quot; (sometimes filled with almond paste), banketletter (pastry filled with almond paste) or a chocolate letter (the first letter of the child&#x27;s name made out of chocolate), chocolate coins, &quot;suikerbeest&quot; (animal-shaped figures made of sugary confection), and &quot;marzipan&quot; figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in coloured aluminium foil.
=== Saint Nicholas&#x27; Eve and Saint Nicholas&#x27; Day ===
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas&#x27; Eve, 5 December, became the chief occasion for gift-giving during the winter holiday season. The evening is called &quot;Sinterklaasavond&quot; (&quot;Sinterklaas evening&quot;) or &quot;Pakjesavond&quot; (&quot;gifts evening&quot;, or literally &quot;packages evening&quot;).

On the evening of 5 December, parents, family, friends or acquaintances pretend to act on behalf of &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;, or his helpers, and fool the children into thinking that &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; has really given them presents. This may be done through a note that is &quot;found&quot;, explaining where the presents are hidden, as though Zwarte Piet visited them and left a burlap sack of presents with them. Sometimes a neighbour will knock on the door (pretending to be a Zwarte Piet) and leave the sack outside for the children to retrieve; this varies per family. When the presents arrive, the living room is decked out with them, much as on Christmas Day in English-speaking countries. On 6 December &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; departs without any ado, and all festivities are over.

In the Southern Netherlands and Belgium, most children have to wait until the morning of 6 December to receive their gifts, and Sinterklaas is seen as a festivity almost exclusively for children. The shoes are filled with a poem or wish list for Sinterklaas and carrots, hay or sugar cubes for the horse on the evening of the fifth and in Belgium often a bottle of beer for Zwarte Piet and a cup of coffee for Sinterklaas are placed next to them. Also in some areas, when it is time for children to give up their pacifier, they place it into his or her shoe (&quot;safekeeping by Sinterklaas&quot;) and it is replaced with chocolate the next morning.

The present is often creatively disguised by being packaged in a humorous, unusual or personalised way. This is called a &quot;surprise&quot; (from the French).

Poems from Sinterklaas usually accompany gifts, bearing a personal message for the receiver. It is usually a humorous poem which often teases the recipient for well-known bad habits or other character deficiencies.

In recent years, influenced by North-American media and the Anglo-Saxon Christmas tradition, when the children reach the age where they get told &quot;the big secret of Sinterklaas&quot;, some people will shift to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for the present giving. Older children in Dutch families where the children are too old to believe in Sinterklaas any more, also often celebrate Christmas with presents instead of &quot;pakjesavond&quot;. Instead of such gifts being brought by Sinterklaas, family members ordinarily draw names for an event comparable to Secret Santa. Because of the popularity of his &quot;older cousin&quot; Sinterklaas, Santa Claus is however not commonly seen in the Netherlands and Belgium.

== History ==
=== Pre-Christian Europe ===
Jacob Grimm, Hélène Adeline Guerber and others have drawn parallels between &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; and his helpers and the Wild Hunt of Wodan or Odin, a major god among the Germanic peoples, who was worshipped in Northern and Western Europe prior to Christianization. Riding the white horse Sleipnir he flew through the air as the leader of the Wild Hunt, always accompanied by two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn. Those helpers would listen, just like Zwarte Piet, at the chimney – which was just a hole in the roof at that time – to tell Wodan about the good and bad behaviour of the mortals. Historian Rita Ghesquiere asserts that it is likely that certain pre-christian elements survived in the honouring of Saint Nicholas. Indeed, it seems clear that the tradition contains a number of elements that are not ecclesiastical in origin.
=== Middle Ages ===
The &quot;Sinterklaasfeest&quot; arose during the Middle Ages. The feast was both an occasion to help the poor, by putting money in their shoes (which evolved into putting presents in children&#x27;s shoes) and a wild feast, similar to Carnival, that often led to costumes, a &quot;topsy-turvy&quot; overturning of daily roles, and mass public drunkenness.

In early traditions, students elected one of their classmates as &quot;bishop&quot; on St. Nicholas Day, who would rule until 28 December (Innocents Day), and they sometimes acted out events from the bishop&#x27;s life. As the festival moved to city streets, it became more lively.
=== 16th and 17th centuries ===
During the Reformation in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, Protestant reformers like Martin Luther changed the Saint gift bringer to the Christ Child or &quot;Christkindl&quot; and moved the date for giving presents from 6 December to Christmas Eve. Certain Protestant municipalities and clerics forbade Saint Nicholas festivities, as the Protestants wanted to abolish the cult of saints and saint adoration, while keeping the midwinter gift-bringing feast alive.

After the successful revolt of the largely Protestant northern provinces of the Low Countries against the rule of Roman Catholic king Philip II of Spain, the new Calvinist regents, ministers and clericals prohibited celebration of Saint Nicholas. The newly independent Dutch Republic officially became a Protestant country and abolished public Catholic celebrations. Nevertheless, the Saint Nicholas feast never completely disappeared in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, where the public Saint Nicholas festivities were very popular, main events like street markets and fairs were kept alive with persons impersonating Nicholas dressed in red clothes instead of a bishop&#x27;s tabard and mitre. The Dutch government eventually tolerated private family celebrations of Saint Nicholas&#x27; Day, as can be seen on Jan Steen&#x27;s painting &quot;The Feast of Saint Nicholas&quot;.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the saint emerged from hiding and the feast became more secularised at the same time. The modern tradition of &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; as a children&#x27;s feast was likely confirmed with the illustrated children&#x27;s book &quot;Sint-Nicolaas en zijn knecht&quot; (&quot;Saint Nicholas and his servant&quot;), written in 1850 by the teacher Jan Schenkman (1806–1863). Some say he introduced the images of Sinterklaas&#x27; delivering presents by the chimney, riding over the roofs of houses on a grey horse, and arriving from Spain by steamboat, which at that time was an exciting modern invention. Perhaps building on the fact that Saint Nicholas historically is the patron saint of the sailors (many churches dedicated to him have been built near harbours), Schenkman could have been inspired by the Spanish customs and ideas about the saint when he portrayed him arriving via the water in his book. Schenkman introduced the song &quot;Zie ginds komt de stoomboot&quot; (&quot;Look over yonder, the steamboat is arriving&quot;), which is still popular in the Netherlands.

In Schenkman&#x27;s version, the medieval figures of the mock devil, which later changed to Oriental or Moorish helpers, was portrayed for the first time as black African and called &quot;Zwarte Piet&quot; (Black Pete).

=== World War II ===
During the German occupation of the Netherlands (1940–1945) many of the traditional &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; rhymes were rewritten to reflect current events. The Royal Air Force (RAF) was often celebrated. In 1941, for instance, the RAF dropped boxes of candy over the occupied Netherlands. One classical poem turned contemporary was the following:

;Dutch
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Sinterklaas, kapoentje,&quot;
&quot;Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,&quot;
&quot;Gooi wat in mijn laarsje,&quot;
&quot;Dank U Sinterklaasje&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

;World War II version
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;R.A.F. Kapoentje,&quot;
&quot;Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,&quot;
&quot;Bij de Moffen gooien,&quot;
&quot;Maar in Holland strooien!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
;English
&lt;poem&gt;
Sinterklaas, little capon,
Throw something in my little shoe,
Throw something in my little boot,
Thank you dear Sinterklaas
&lt;/poem&gt;

;World War II version
&lt;poem&gt;
R.A.F. little Capon,
throw something in my little shoe
throw [bombs] at the Krauts
but scatter [candy] in Holland!
&lt;/poem&gt;

This is a variation of one of the best-known traditional Sinterklaas rhymes, with &quot;RAF&quot; replacing &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; in the first line (the two expressions have the same metrical characteristics in the first and second, and in the third and fourth lines). The Dutch word &quot;kapoentje&quot; (little rascal) is traditional to the rhyme, but in this case it also alludes to a capon. The second line is straight from the original rhyme, but in the third and fourth line the RAF is encouraged to drop bombs on the &quot;Moffen&quot; (slur for Germans, like &quot;krauts&quot; in English) and candy over the Netherlands. Many of the &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; poems of this time noted the lack of food and basic necessities, and the German occupiers having taken everything of value; others expressed admiration for the Dutch Resistance.

Originally &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; was only accompanied by one (or sometimes two) &quot;Zwarte Pieten&quot;, but just after the liberation of the Netherlands, Canadian soldiers organised a Sinterklaas party with many Zwarte Pieten, and ever since this has been the custom, each Piet normally having his own dedicated task.

== Popularity and celebration outside the Netherlands ==

The festival has also been adhered in the former Dutch colonies. In Curaçao, Dutch-style Sinterklaas events were organised until 2020. The Zwarte Piet costumes were purple, gold, blue, yellow and orange but especially black and dark black. Prime Minister Ivar Asjes has spoken negatively of the tradition. In 2011, the government of Gerrit Schotte threatened to withdraw the grant for the Dutch tradition after the Curaçaoan activist Quinsy Gario was arrested, when he protested in Dordrecht against the use of Zwarte Piet. Since 2020, the Sinterklaas feast is no longer nationally celebrated in Curaçao and has been replaced by Children&#x27;s Day on 20 November.

Dutch-style Sinterklaas events were also organised in Suriname. In 1970 the Surinamese playwright Eugène Drenthe envisioned the character of &quot;Gudu Ppa&quot; (&quot;Father of Riches&quot; in Sranantongo) as a postcolonial replacement of Sinterklaas. Instead of a white man, Gudu Ppa was black. His helpers symbolised Suriname&#x27;s different ethnic groups, replacing Zwarte Piet. Although promoted by the military regime in the eighties, Gudu Ppa never really caught on. In 2011, opposition member of parliament and former president Ronald Venetiaan called for an official ban on Sinterklaas because he considered Zwarte Piet to be a racist element. Since 2013, the Sinterklaas feast on 5 December has been replaced by &quot;Kinderdag&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Day&quot;) in Suriname.

Sinterklaas events were held in Indonesia until 1957 when, in what became known as &quot;Black Sinterklaas&quot; (; ), they were banned by the government as part of its broader decolonization efforts.

The Saint Nicholas Society of New York celebrates a feast on 6 December to this day. In the Hudson Valley region of New York, Sinterklaas is celebrated annually in the towns of Rhinebeck and Kingston because of the region&#x27;s Dutch heritage. It includes Sinterklaas&#x27; crossing the Hudson River and then a parade.

==Sinterklaas as a source for Santa Claus==
&quot;Sinterklaas&quot; is the basis for the North American figure of Santa Claus. It is often claimed that during the American War of Independence, the inhabitants of New York City, a former Dutch colonial town (New Amsterdam), reinvented their &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; tradition, as Saint Nicholas was a symbol of the city&#x27;s non-English past. In the 1770s the &quot;New York Gazetteer&quot; noted that the feast day of &quot;St. a Claus&quot; was celebrated &quot;by the descendants of the ancient Dutch families, with their usual festivities.&quot; In a study of the &quot;children&#x27;s books, periodicals and journals&quot; of New Amsterdam, the scholar Charles Jones did not find references to Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas. Not all scholars agree with Jones&#x27; findings, which he reiterated in a book in 1978. Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlement of the Hudson Valley. He agrees that &quot;there can be no question that by the time the revival of St. Nicholas came with Washington Irving, the traditional New Netherlands observance had completely disappeared.&quot; However, Irving&#x27;s stories prominently featured legends of the early Dutch settlers, so while the traditional practice may have died out, Irving&#x27;s St. Nicholas may have been a revival of that dormant Dutch strand of folklore. In his 1812 revisions to &quot;A History of New York&quot;, Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus.

In New York, two years earlier John Pintard published a pamphlet with illustrations of Alexander Anderson in which he calls for making Saint Nicholas the patron Saint of New York and starting a Sinterklaas tradition. He was apparently assisted by the Dutch because in his pamphlet he included an old Dutch Sinterklaas poem with an English translation. In the Dutch poem, Saint Nicholas is referred to as &#x27;Sancta Claus&#x27;. Ultimately, his initiative helped &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; to pop up as Santa Claus in the Christmas celebration, which returned freed of episcopal dignity and ties via England and later Germany to Europe again.

During the Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer from Sinterklaas to the Christ Child or &quot;Christkindl&quot; (corrupted in English to Kris Kringle). Similarly, the date of giving gifts changed from 5 or 6 December to Christmas Eve.

==Sinterklaas in fiction==

In a scene in the 1947 film &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;, a Dutch girl recognises Macy&#x27;s department store Santa as Sinterklaas. They converse in Dutch and sing a Sinterklaas song while she sits on his lap.

Santa Claus is portrayed as Sinterklaas in the 1985 film &quot;One Magic Christmas&quot;: he and his wife have Dutch accents, and she calls him Nicolaas. In lieu of elves, his helpers are &quot;Christmas angels&quot; who are deceased people of all nationalities.

Sinterklaas has been the subject of a number of Dutch novels, films and television series, primarily aimed at children. Sinterklaas-themed children&#x27;s films include &quot;Winky&#x27;s Horse&quot; (2005) and the sequel &quot;Where Is Winky&#x27;s Horse?&quot; (2007).

Sinterklaas-themed films aimed at adults include the drama &quot;Makkers Staakt uw Wild Geraas&quot; (1960), which won a Silver Bear award at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival; the romantic comedy &quot;Alles is Liefde&quot; (2007) and its Belgian remake &quot;Zot van A.&quot; (2010); and the Dick Maas-directed horror film &quot;Sint&quot; (2010).

&quot;De Club van Sinterklaas&quot; is a Sinterklaas-themed soap opera aimed at children. The popular television series has run since 1999 and has had a number of spin-off series. Since 2001, a Sinterklaas &quot;news&quot; program aimed at children is broadcast daily on Dutch television during the holiday season, &quot;Het Sinterklaasjournaal&quot;. The Dutch-Belgian Nickelodeon series &quot;Slot Marsepeinstein&quot; has aired since 2009.

Much of the first half of the 2007 novella &quot;A War of Gifts&quot; by Orson Scott Card is about the Sinterklaas tradition, including chapter 4 &quot;Sinterklaas Eve&quot; and 5 &quot;Sinterklaas Day&quot;.

In the fourth episode of the television series &quot;The Librarians&quot; (&quot;And Santa&#x27;s Midnight Ride&quot;), Santa (Bruce Campbell) is an &quot;immortal avatar&quot; who has existed in many different incarnations throughout history. After experiencing mistletoe poisoning, he briefly turns into Sinterklaas, using his magic to play tricks and make toys appear in people&#x27;s shoes, before regaining control of his current incarnation.

From 1987 to 2012 Sinterklaas also appeared every year in &quot;Sesamstraat&quot;, the Dutch version of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

== Related holiday figures ==

Other holiday figures based on Saint Nicholas are celebrated in some parts of Germany and Austria (&quot;Sankt Nikolaus&quot;); the Czech Republic and Slovakia (&quot;Mikuláš&quot;); Hungary (&quot;Mikulás&quot;); Switzerland (&quot;Samichlaus&quot;); Italy (&quot;San Nicola&quot; in Bari, South Tyrol, Alpine municipalities, and many others); parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia (&quot;Sveti Nikola&quot;); Slovenia (&quot;Sveti Nikolaj&quot; or &quot;Sveti Miklavž&quot;); Greece (&quot;Agios Nikolaos&quot;); Romania (&quot;Moș Nicolae&quot;); Albania (&quot;Shën Kolli&quot;, &quot;Nikolli&quot;), among others.

<doc id="520012" wikidata="Q337459" url="?curid=520012" title="William Adamson">
<text>William Adamson (2 April 1863 – 23 February 1936) was a Scottish trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was Leader of the Labour Party from 1917 to 1921 and was Secretary of State for Scotland in 1924 and during 1929–1931 in the first two Labour ministries headed by Ramsay MacDonald.

==Background==
Adamson was born in Dunfermline, Fife, and was educated at a local dame school. He worked as a miner in Fife where he became involved with the National Union of Mineworkers. In 1902–08 he was Assistant Secretary of the Fife and Kinross Miners&#x27; Association, and he thereafter served as its General Secretary.

==Political career==

Active with the new Labour Party, Adamson was first elected to Parliament for West Fife in the December 1910 general election. His victory was the only Labour gain from the Liberals in that election.

Adamson was elected Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party on 24 October 1917, a post he held until 1921. He led the party into the general election of 1918, which saw Labour gain 15 seats and become the largest opposition party in the House of Commons for the first time; however, there remained uncertainty as to whether Adamson or the leader of the independent Liberals, Donald Maclean could claim to be the true leader of the opposition in the Commons.

In 1918 he was sworn into the Privy Council. In 1919, Adamson was confident that the experience of the First World War would &quot;produce a different atmosphere and an entirely different relationship amongst all sections of our people&quot; and would act as a watershed in the process of social reform. He served as Secretary for Scotland and Secretary of State for Scotland in 1924 and between 1929 and 1931 in the Labour governments of Ramsay MacDonald.

However, he split with MacDonald after the formation of the National Government. Adamson lost his seat in the 1931 election which he contested for Labour against MacDonald&#x27;s coalition. He stood again in the 1935 election but again failed to take the seat, losing on this occasion to William Gallacher of the Communist Party of Great Britain.

==Personal life==
Adamson was married to Christina Myles Marshall (1862–1935), a factory worker, with whom he had two daughters and two sons; one of the latter was killed during the First World War.

Adamson died in February 1936, aged 72. He is buried in Dunfermline Cemetery, just north of the roundel at the end of the entrance avenue.

<doc id="520021" wikidata="Q1146916" url="?curid=520021" title="Dewey Square Tunnel">
<text>The Dewey Square Tunnel in Boston, Massachusetts, is part of Interstate 93 (concurrent with US 1 and Route 3), running under the heart of the city&#x27;s financial district, including Dewey Square. Built in 1959, it was part of Boston&#x27;s Central Artery freeway construction project of the 1950s. Known to locals as the South Station Tunnel (due to its proximity to South Station), the Dewey Square Tunnel is of cut-and-cover design, and originally was six lanes wide (three in each direction), with no breakdown lanes.

Because of public outcry during construction of The Central Artery, elevated for most of its length and reviled because it cut off views of and access to Boston&#x27;s historic waterfront, it was decided by then-Governor John A. Volpe that the final section of the artery was to be put underground from just south of Congress Street to Kneeland Street near Boston&#x27;s Chinatown section. At the time of its construction, it was the widest vehicular tunnel in the world.

At one time, a bus terminal serving Peter Pan, Bonanza, and other regional bus lines sat atop the tunnel near its northern portal. The bus station has since been relocated to the major intermodal transportation hub at South Station.

The lack of breakdown lanes, the limited number of travel lanes, and the myriad access ramps to and from the Artery and the tunnel caused massive traffic jams and gridlock, forcing transportation officials to consider rebuilding the Artery and putting it totally underground. The Dewey Square Tunnel received new life as part of the massive Big Dig project of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The tunnel was rehabilitated and now serves as exclusive southbound lanes of Interstate 93, complete with a new ventilation system and gently banked corners consistent with appropriate superelevation. Its old northern portal at Congress Street was connected to the underground southbound lanes of the new artery in 2005.

A long-closed northbound off-ramp to Chinatown was rebuilt and reopened as a southbound on-ramp from Surface Road. The refurbished tunnel, with 6 lanes at its widest point, was fully opened on March 5, 2005. The Dewey Square Tunnel is the only remaining section of the original Central Artery still in use. Since the completion of the Big Dig project, the name &quot;Dewey Square (South Station) Tunnel&quot; has fallen into general disuse; instead, it is considered to be part of the Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Tunnel, a name used for the entire length of the north–south tunnel system.

<text>Alexander Godfrey (c.17561803) was an 18th-century British privateer during the War of the Second Coalition against France and Spain.

Godfrey was born in Chatham, Massachusetts in c.1756, and later moved to Nova Scotia. In 1791 he married Phoebe West.

By 1800, Britain was at war with France and Spain, both of which had a significant naval and commercial maritime presence in the Americas. Godfrey obtained a letter of marque to serve as a privateer for Britain, and put to sea in command of &quot;Rover&quot;, a 14-gun brig. In 1800, while possibly in company with other vessels, &quot;Rover&quot; encountered and defeated three Spanish warships; in recognition of which Godfrey was offered a Royal Navy commission. Godfrey subsequently paid £850 to purchase one of the Spanish vessels when it was sold as a prize, then sailed it Halifax, Nova Scotia for resale at £1000.

Godfrey died of yellow fever in Jamaica in 1803. His only child Ruth, who died of burns, is buried in Liverpool, Nova Scotia&#x27;s historic cemetery.

<doc id="520042" wikidata="Q898525" url="?curid=520042" title="Protecting group">
<text>A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction. It plays an important role in multistep organic synthesis.

In many preparations of delicate organic compounds, specific parts of the molecules cannot survive the required reagents or chemical environments. These parts (functional groups) must be protected. For example, lithium aluminium hydride is a highly reactive reagent that usefully reduces esters to alcohols. It always reacts with carbonyl groups, and cannot be discouraged by any means. When an ester must be reduced in the presence of a carbonyl, hydride attack on the carbonyl must be prevented. One way to do so converts the carbonyl into an acetal, which does not react with hydrides. The acetal is then called a protecting group for the carbonyl. After the hydride step is complete, aqueous acid removes the acetal, restoring the carbonyl. This step is called deprotection.

Protecting groups are more common in small-scale laboratory work and initial development than in industrial production because they add additional steps and material costs. However, compounds with repetitive functional groups – generally, biomolecules like peptides, oligosaccharides or nucleotides – may require protecting groups to order their assembly. Also, cheap chiral protecting groups may often &quot;shorten&quot; an enantioselective synthesis (e.g. shikimic acid for oseltamivir).

As a rule, the introduction of a protecting group is straightforward. The difficulties honestly lie in their stability and in selective removal. Apparent problems in synthesis strategies with protecting groups are rarely documented in the academic literature.

==Orthogonal protection==
Orthogonal protection is a strategy allowing the specific deprotection of one protective group in a multiply-protected structure. For example, the amino acid tyrosine could be protected as a benzyl ester on the carboxyl group, a fluorenylmethylenoxy carbamate on the amine group, and a &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether on the phenol group. The benzyl ester can be removed by hydrogenolysis, the fluorenylmethylenoxy group (Fmoc) by bases (such as piperidine), and the phenolic &quot;tert&quot;-butyl ether cleaved with acids (e.g. with trifluoroacetic acid).

A common example for this application, the Fmoc peptide synthesis, in which peptides are grown in solution and on solid phase, is very important. The protecting groups in solid-phase synthesis regarding the reaction conditions such as reaction time, temperature and reagents can be standardized so that they are carried out by a machine, while yields of well over 99% can be achieved. Otherwise, the separation of the resulting mixture of reaction products is virtually impossible (see also ). 
A further important example of orthogonal protecting groups occurs in carbohydrate chemistry. As carbohydrates or hydroxyl groups exhibit very similar reactivities, a transformation that protects or deprotects a single hydroxy group must be possible for a successful synthesis.

=== Cleavage categorization ===
Many reaction conditions have been established that will cleave protecting groups. One can roughly distinguish between the following environments:

* Acid-labile protecting groups
* Base-labile protecting groups
* Fluoride-labile protecting groups
* Enzyme-labile protecting groups
* Reduction-labile protecting groups
* Oxidation-labile protecting groups
* Protecting groups cleaved by heavy metal salts or their complexes.
* Photolabile protecting groups
* Double-layered protecting groups

Various groups are cleaved in acid or base conditions, but the others are more unusual.

Fluoride ions form very strong bonds to silicon; thus silicon protecting groups are almost invariably removed by fluoride ions. Each type of counterion, i.e. cleavage reagent, can also selectively cleave different silicon protecting groups depending on steric hindrance. The advantage of fluoride-labile protecting groups is that no other protecting group is attacked by the cleavage conditions.

Lipases and other enzymes cleave ethers at biological pH (5-9) and temperatures (30–40 °C). Because enzymes have very high substrate specificity, the method is quite rare, but extremely attractive.

Catalytic hydrogenation removes a wide variety of benzyl groups: ethers, esters, urethanes, carbonates, etc.

Only a few protecting groups can be detached oxidatively: the methoxybenzyl ethers, which oxidize to a quinomethide. They can be removed with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) or dichlorodicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ).
Allyl compounds will isomerize to a vinyl group in the presence of noble metals. The residual enol ether (from a protected alcohol) or enamine (resp. amine) hydrolyzes in light acid.

Photolabile protecting groups bear a chromophore, which is activated through radiation with an appropriate wavelength and so can be removed. For examples the &quot;o&quot;-nitrobenzylgroup ought be listed here.

The rare double-layer protecting group is a protected protecting group, which exemplify high stability.

==Common protecting groups==

===Alcohol protecting groups===
The classical protecting groups for alcohols are esters, deprotected by nucleophiles; triorganosilyl ethers, deprotected by acids and fluoride ions; and (hemi)acetals, deprotected by weak acids. In rarer cases, a carbon ether might be used.

The most important esters with common protecting-group use are the acetate, benzoate, and pivalate esters, for these exhibit differential removal. Sterically hindered esters are less susceptible to nucleophilic attack:

: Chloroacetyl &gt; acetyl &gt; benzoyl &gt; pivaloyl
Triorganosilyl sources have quite variable prices, and the most economical is chlorotrimethylsilane (TMS-Cl), a Direct Process byproduct. The trimethylsilyl ethers are also extremely sensitive to acid hydrolysis (for example silica gel suffices as a proton donator) and are consequently rarely used nowadays as protecting groups.

Aliphatic methyl ethers cleave with difficulty and only under drastic conditions, so that these are in general only used with quinonic phenols. However, hemiacetals and acetals are much easier to cleave.

=== 1,2-Diols ===
The 1,2diols (glycols) present for protecting-group chemistry a special class of alcohols. One can exploit the adjacency of two hydroxy groups, e.g. in sugars, in that one protects both hydroxy groups codependently as an acetal. Common in this situation are the benzylidene, isopropylidene and cyclohexylidene or cyclopentylidene acetals.

An exceptional case appears with the benzylideneprotecting group,which also admits reductive cleavage. This proceeds either through catalytic hydrogenation or with the hydride donor diisobutyl aluminum hydride (DIBAL). The cleavage with DIBAL deprotects one alcohol group, for the benzyl moiety stays as a benzyl ether on the second, sterically hindered hydroxy group.
===Amine protecting groups===
Amines have a special importance in peptide synthesis, but are a quite potent nucleophile and also relatively strong bases. These characteristics imply that new protecting groups for amines are always under development.

Amine groups are primarily protected through acylation, typically as a carbamate. When a carbamate deprotects, it evolves carbon dioxide. The commonest-used carbamates are the &quot;tert&quot;-butoxycarbonyl, benzoxycarbonyl, fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl compounds.

Other, more exotic amine protectors are the phthalimides, which admit reductive cleavage, and the trifluoroacetamides, which hydrolyze easily in base. Indoles, pyrroles und imidazoles — verily any aza-heterocycle — admit protection as &quot;N&quot;sulfonylamides,which are far too stable with aliphatic amines. &quot;N&quot;benzylated amines can be removed through catalytic hydrogenation or Birch reduction, but have a decided drawback relative to the carbamates or amides: they retain a basic nitrogen.

==== Selection ====
Carbamates:
* Carbamate group – Removed by acid and mild heating.
* Carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group — Removed by hydrogenolysis: hydrogen and palladium on activated carbon, or lithium or sodium in liquid ammonia.
* &quot;p&quot;-Methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl (Moz or MeOZ) group – Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than Cbz
* &quot;tert&quot;-Butyloxycarbonyl (Boc) group — Removed by concentrated strong acid (such as HCl or CF3COOH), or by heating to &gt;80 °C. Common in solid phase peptide synthesis. 
* 9-Fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) group — Removed by base, such as 20–50 % piperidine in dimethylformamide (DMF) or &quot;N&quot;-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, or 50% morpholine in DMF for sensitive glycopeptides. Common in solid phase peptide synthesis
* Allyloxycarbamate group — Removed with complexes of metals like palladium(0) or nickel(0). 
Other amides:
* Acetyl (), Benzoyl () groups — common in oligonucleotide synthesis for protection of N4 in cytosine and N6 in adenine. Removed by base, often aqueous or gaseous ammonia or methylamine. Too stable to readily remove from aliphatic amides.
* Troc (trichloroethyl chloroformate ) group – Removed by Zn insertion in the presence of acetic acid
* Tosyl (Ts) group – Removed by concentrated acid (HBr, H2SO4) &amp; strong reducing agents (sodium in liquid ammonia or sodium naphthalenide)
* Other sulfonamide (Nosyl &amp; Nps) groups — Removed by samarium iodide, thiophenol or other soft thiol nucleophiles, or tributyltin hydride
Benzylamines:
* Benzyl (Bn) group – Removed by hydrogenolysis
* &quot;p&quot;-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) – Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than benzyl
* 3,4-Dimethoxybenzyl (DMPM) – Removed by hydrogenolysis, more labile than &quot;p&quot;-methoxybenzyl
* &quot;p&quot;-Methoxyphenyl (PMP) group – Removed by ammonium cerium(IV) nitrate (CAN)

===Carbonyl protecting groups===
The most common protecting groups for carbonyls are acetals and typically cyclic acetals with diols. The runners-up used are also cyclic acetals with 1,2hydroxythiols or dithioglycols – the so-called &quot;O&quot;,&quot;S&quot;– or &quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-acetals.

Overall, trans-acetalation plays a lesser role in forming protective acetals; they are formed as a rule from glycols through dehydration. Normally a simple glycol like ethylene glycol or 1,3-propadiol is used for acetalation.Modern variants also use glycols, but with the hydroxyl hydrogens replaced with a trimethylsilyl group.

Acetals can be removed in acidic aqueous conditions. For those ends, the mineral acids are appropriate acids. Acetone is a common cosolvent, used to promote dissolution. For a non-acidic cleavage technique, a palladium(II) chloride acetonitrile complex in acetone or iron(III) chloride on silica gel can be performed with workup in chloroform.

Cyclic acetals are very much more stable against acid hydrolysis than acyclic acetals. Consequently acyclic acetals are used practically only when a very mild cleavage is required or when two different protected carbonyl groups must be differentiated in their liberation.

Besides the &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-acetals, the &quot;S&quot;,&quot;O&quot;- and &quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-acetals also have an application, albeit scant, as carbonyl protecting groups too. Thiols, which one begins with to form these acetals, have a very unpleasant stench and are poisonous, which severely limit their applications. Thioacetals and the mixed &quot;S&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-acetals are, unlike the pure &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-acetals, very much stabler against acid hydrolysis. This enables the selective cleavage of the latter in the presence of sulfur-protected carbonyl groups.

The formation of &quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-acetals normally follows analogously to the &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-acetals with acid catalysis from a dithiol and the carbonyl compound. Because of the greater stability of thioacetals, the equilibrium lies on the side of the acetal. In contradistinction to the &quot;O&quot;,&quot;O&quot;acetal case, it is not needed to remove water from the reaction mixture in order to shift the equilibrium.

&quot;S&quot;,&quot;O&quot;-Acetals are hydrolyzed a factor of 10,000 times faster than the corresponding &quot;S&quot;,&quot;S&quot;-acetals. Their formation follows analogously from the thioalcohol. Also their cleavage proceeds under similar conditions and predominantly through mercury(II) compounds in wet acetonitrile.

For aldehydes, a temporary protection of the carbonyl group the presence of ketones as hemiaminal ions is shown below. Here it is applied, that aldehydes are very much more activated carbonyls than ketones and that many addition reactions are reversible.
==== Types of protectants ====
* Acetals and Ketals – Removed by acid. Normally, the cleavage of acyclic acetals is easier than of cyclic acetals.
* Acylals – Removed by Lewis acids.
* Dithianes – Removed by metal salts or oxidizing agents.

===Carboxylic acid protecting groups===
The most important protecting groups for carboxylic acids are the esters of various alcohols. Occasionally, esters are protected as ortho-esters or oxazolines.

Many groups can suffice for the alcoholic component, and the specific cleaving conditions are contrariwise generally quite similar: each ester can be hydrolyzed in a basic water-alcohol solution. Instead, most ester protecting groups vary in how mildly they can be formed from the original acid.

==== Protecting groups ====
* Methyl esters — Also removed by acid or pig liver esterase. Can be formed from diazomethane in diethyl ether, caesium carbonate and methyl iodide in &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;dimethylformamide, or methanol and catalytic trimethylsilyl chloride
* Benzyl esters — Also removed by hydrogenolysis.
* Benzhydryl esters — Same as benzyl, but easier to cleave
* &quot;tert&quot;-Butyl esters – Also removed by acid and some reductants. Can be formed from carboalkoxylation: isobutene in dioxane and catalytic sulfuric acid
* 2,6Dialkylphenols (e.g. 2,6-dimethylphenol, 2,6-diisopropylphenol, 2,6-di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylphenol) — Also removed in DBU-catalyzed high-pressure methanolysis at room temperature.
* Allyl esters — As with allyl ethers, also removed by diverse platinum complexes – connected with acid workup
* Silyl esters – Also removed by base and organometallic reagents.
* Orthoesters – Converted to standard ester by mild aqueous acid
* Oxazoline – Removed by strong hot acid (pH &lt; 1, T &gt; 100 °C) or alkali (pH &gt; 12, T &gt; 100 °C), but not e.g. LiAlH4, organolithium reagents or Grignard (organomagnesium) reagents

=== Alkene ===
Alkenes rarely need protection or are protected. They are as a rule only involved in undesired side reactions with electrophilic attack, isomerization or catalytic hydration. For alkenes two protecting groups are basically known:

* Temporary halogenation with bromine to a &quot;trans&quot;1,2dibromoalkane: the regeneration of the alkene then follows with preservation of conformation via elemental zinc or with titanocene dichloride.
* Protection through a Diels-Alder reaction: the transformation of an alkene with a diene leads to a cyclic alkene, which is nevertheless similarly endangered by electrophilic attack as the original alkene. The cleavage of a protecting diene proceeds thermically, for the Diels-Alder reaction is a reversible (equilibrium) reaction.

===Phosphate protecting groups===
* 2-cyanoethyl – removed by mild base. The group is widely used in oligonucleotide synthesis.
* Methyl (Me) – removed by strong nucleophiles &quot;e.c&quot;. thiophenole/TEA.

===Terminal alkyne protecting groups===
For alkynes there are in any case two types of protecting groups. For terminal alkynes it is sometimes important to mask the acidic hydrogen atom. This normally proceeds from deprotonation (via a strong base like methylmagnesium bromide or butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran/dimethylsulfoxide) and subsequently reaction with chlorotrimethylsilane to a terminally TMS-protected alkyne. Cleavage follows hydrolytically – with potassium carbonate in methanol – or with fluoride ions like for example with tetrabutylammonium fluoride.

In order to protect the triple bond itself, sometimes a transition metal-alkyne complex with dicobalt octacarbonyl is used. The release of the cobalt then follows from oxidation.
===Other===
==Criticism==
The use of protective groups is pervasive but not without criticism. In practical terms their use adds two steps (protection-deprotection sequence) to a synthesis, either or both of which can dramatically lower chemical yield. Crucially, added complexity impedes the use of synthetic total synthesis in drug discovery. In contrast biomimetic synthesis does not employ protective groups. As an alternative, Baran presented a novel protective-group free synthesis of the compound hapalindole U. The previously published synthesis according to Baran, contained 20 steps with multiple protective group manipulations (two confirmed):

== Industrial applications ==
Although the use of protecting groups is not preferred in industrial syntheses, they are still used in industrial contexts, e.g. sucralose (sweetener) or the Roche synthesis of oseltamivir (Tamiflu, an antiviral drug)

An important example of industrial applications of protecting group theory is the synthesis of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) à la Reichstein.

In order to prevent oxidation of the secondary alcohols with potassium permanganate, they are protected via acetalation with acetone and then deprotected after the oxidation of the primary alcohols to carboxylic acids.

A very spectacular example application of protecting groups from natural product synthesis is the 1994 total synthesis of palytoxin acid by Yoshito Kishi&#x27;s research group. Here 42 functional groups (39 hydroxyls, one diol, an amine group, and a carboxylic acid) required protection. These proceeded through 8 different protecting groups (a methyl ester, five acetals, 20 TBDMS esters, nine &quot;p&quot;methoxybenzyl ethers, four benzoates, a methyl hemiacetal, an acetone acetal and an SEM ester).

The introduction or modification of a protecting group occasionally influences the reactivity of the whole molecule. For example, diagrammed below is an excerpt of the synthesis of an analogue of Mitomycin C by Danishefsky.

The exchange of a protecting group from a methyl ether to a MOM-ether inhibits here the opening of an epoxide to an aldehyde.

Protecting group chemistry finds itself an important application in the automated synthesis of peptides and nucleosides. The technique was introduced in the field of peptide synthesis by Robert Bruce Merrifield in 1977. For peptide synthesis via automated machine, the orthogonality of the Fmoc group (basic cleavage), the &quot;tert&quot;butyl group (acidic cleavage) and diverse protecting groups for functional groups on the amino acid side-chains are used. Up to four different protecting groups per nucleobase are used for the automated synthesis of DNA and RNA sequences in the oligonucleotide synthesis. The procedure begins actually with redox chemistry at the protected phosphorus atom. A tricoordinate phosphorus, used on account of the high reactivity, is tagged with a cyanoethyl protecting group on a free oxygen. After the coupling step follows an oxidation to phosphate, whereby the protecting group stays attached. Free OH-groups, which did not react in the coupling step, are acetylated in an intermediate step. These additionally-introduced protecting groups then inhibit, that these OH-groups might couple in the next cycle.

<text>The Crows were an American R&amp;B vocal group formed in 1951. They achieved commercial success and popularity during the 1950s with their debut single and only hit, &quot;Gee&quot;. The single, released in June 1953, has been credited with being the first rock and roll hit by a rock and roll group. It peaked at position number 14 and number 2, respectively, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop and R&amp;B charts in 1954. Although Gee fell into the doo-wop genre, and &quot;was the first 1950s doo-wop record to sell over one million records&quot; in that genre, some (including Jay Warner) consider it as the first of the &quot;rock and roll records&quot;. 

==History==
When The Crows started in 1951, practicing sidewalk harmonies, the original members were Daniel &quot;Sonny&quot; Norton (lead), William &quot;Bill&quot; Davis (baritone), Harold Major (tenor), Jerry Wittick (tenor) and Gerald Hamilton (bass). In 1952, Wittick left the group and was replaced by Mark Jackson (tenor and guitarist).

They were discovered at Apollo Theater&#x27;s Wednesday night talent show by talent agent Cliff Martinez and brought to independent producer George Goldner, who had just started the Rama Records label. 
The Crows were the first group signed and the first to record. The first songs they recorded were as backup to singer Viola Watkins. The song &quot;Gee&quot; was the third song recorded during their first recording session, on February 10, 1953. It was put together in a few minutes by group member William Davis, with Watkins credited as co-writer.

The song was first released as the B-side of the ballad &quot;I Love You So&quot;. However, radio stations began playing &quot;Gee,&quot; first in Philadelphia and later in New York and Los Angeles. By January 1954, it had sold 100,000 copies, and by April it entered the national R&amp;B and pop charts, rising to number 2 R&amp;B and number 14 pop. The song was a hit a year after it was recorded.

The Crows were a one-hit wonder. While &quot;Gee&quot; was on the charts, the record company released a number of other singles by the group, including &quot;Heartbreaker,&quot; &quot;Baby,&quot; and &quot;Miss You,&quot; but none were successful. Their failures and the inability to perform regularly to support their recordings, led to the breakup of the group a few months after &quot;Gee&quot; dropped off the charts. They maintained the original lineup for the entire career of the group, with no hope of a reunion following the deaths of Gerald Hamilton in the 1960s and Daniel Norton in 1972.

<text>The Quabbin Reservoir is the largest inland body of water in Massachusetts, United States, and was built between 1930 and 1939. Along with the Wachusett Reservoir, it is the primary water supply for Boston, to the east, and 40 other cities and towns in Greater Boston. The Quabbin also supplies water to three towns west of the reservoir and acts as backup supply for three others. By 1989, it supplied water for 2.5 million people, about 40% of the state&#x27;s population at the time. It has an aggregate capacity of and an area of 38.6 square miles (99.9 km2).

==Structures and water flow==

Quabbin Reservoir water flows to the Wachusett Reservoir through the Quabbin Aqueduct. The Quabbin watershed is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, while the water supply system is operated by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. The Winsor Dam and the Goodnough Dike form the reservoir from impoundments of the three branches of the Swift River. The Quabbin Reservoir is part of the Chicopee River Watershed, which in turn feeds the Connecticut River.

The Quabbin Spillway, which follows part of Quabbin Hill Road in Belchertown, allows water to bypass the Winsor Dam and join the Swift River when the reservoir is full.

In 1947, the Massachusetts Legislature authorized the construction of the Chicopee Valley Aqueduct to deliver Quabbin water to three communities in Western Massachusetts: Chicopee, South Hadley, and Wilbraham. In 1951, with the Quabbin-Wachusett system sufficient to meet foreseeable needs, the Cochituate Aqueduct was abandoned, and the Framingham Reservoir system was placed on emergency stand-by. The present Lake Cochituate is the so-called Framingham Reservoir and now serves as a major swimming and boating resource but is no longer part of the potable water supply.

==History==

===Demand for water exceeds local supplies===
Metropolitan Boston&#x27;s demands for fresh water began to outstrip its local supplies in the early part of the nineteenth century. Many possible sources of water were explored, including groundwater and rivers, but none were considered adequate in quantity and cleanliness to meet the needs of the rapidly growing city. In 1848, after several years of controversy, the Massachusetts General Court (the official name of the state legislature) authorized the construction of the Cochituate Aqueduct to bring water to Boston from Lake Cochituate in Wayland and Natick.

This established three important policies, which remain in force today:
#Public, rather than private, ownership of the public water supply system.
#Use of upland reservoirs, with gravity-fed rather than pumped supply systems.
#Watershed protection, rather than filtration, as the primary mechanism of ensuring wholesome supplies.

By 1875, with demand again on the verge of exceeding supply, the Boston Water Board was established to take over the operations of the Cochituate Water Board, construct five new reservoirs on the Sudbury River in Framingham, Massachusetts, and a new Sudbury Aqueduct to deliver that water to the city, which was completed in 1878.

===Recommendation for establishment and related construction===
In 1893, the Massachusetts Board of Health issued a report analyzing population and water-use trends, and recommended the creation of a Metropolitan Water District, serving several suburban communities in addition to Boston, and the construction of two new reservoirs: one on the Nashua River northeast of Worcester, and one in the Swift River Valley.

The General Court acted to establish the Metropolitan Water District, including 26 communities within ten miles (16 km) of the Massachusetts State House, later in 1895. The Wachusett Reservoir was completed in 1908. The Board of Health study had anticipated that Swift River water would be required by 1915, but this prediction had proven overly pessimistic. The introduction of mandatory water metering in Water District communities, and other efforts to reduce waste and inefficient uses, made it possible to delay construction of new water sources until the 1930s.

Frank E. Winsor was chief engineer for the Metropolitan Water District from 1926 until his death in 1939. He was closely involved in the design and construction of Winsor Dam, Goodnough Dike and the Quabbin Reservoir. Winsor Dam is named for him. He had previously been chief engineer for the building of the Scituate Reservoir in Rhode Island.

A 1922 study officially endorsed the Swift River Valley as the next extension of the water system and created the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), now the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority (MWRA), to oversee the construction and maintain the system after its completion. In 1926, the Ware River Act was passed, starting construction on the first stage of the project, a 12-mile long tunnel connecting Wachusett Reservoir with the Ware River. This is called the Ware River Diversion. During the 1930s, this tunnel was extended to the Swift River. The complete tunnel is now known as the Quabbin Aqueduct.

===Opposition===
Although the project was enthusiastically supported by lawmakers in the Boston area, it was opposed by residents of the affected towns. The state of Connecticut sued Massachusetts, claiming waters that were rightfully meant to flow into the Connecticut River, and subsequently through their state, were being illegally diverted. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, but Massachusetts was still bound by discharge minimums set under the regulatory authority of the Secretary of War over navigable waters. Specifically, the Swift River needed to maintain a 20 million gallon per day flow downriver from the dam.

===Reservoir formed===

Before the reservoir&#x27;s construction, there was a hill in Enfield called Quabbin Hill and a lake in Greenwich called Quabbin Lake. These were from the Nipmuc word meaning &quot;place of many waters&quot; or &quot;meeting of many waters&quot;, and became the basis for naming the new reservoir. The Quabbin was formed by inundating the Swift River Valley, a drainage basin lying entirely within the state, by damming the river and a col, through which Beaver Brook would have otherwise provided another outlet for its water. When construction on the dam began in the mid-1930s, the Swift River was redirected from its riverbed through a diversion tunnel. On August 14, 1939, that tunnel was sealed with rock. Over the next seven years, the waters of the Quabbin Reservoir slowly rose behind the newly completed Winsor Dam, an earth-filled structure long, rising above the riverbed, and the slightly smaller Goodnough Dike. The water gradually submerged the roads that had linked the towns. It swallowed all but the peaks of about 60 hills and mountains, transforming Prescott Ridge into Prescott Peninsula. The Quabbin Reservoir was full, for the first time, in June 1946.

In 1941, the land that would become the Prescott Peninsula became the Quabbin Reservoir Precision Bombing and Gunnery Range. The range was used by Army Air Forces and later US Air Force planes from both Hanscom Army Air Field and Westover Army Air Field from 1941 through 1951. It was also used for practice landings. In the late 2000s the site was surveyed by state authorities and the federal Formerly Used Defense Sites program for potential unexploded ordnance or other contamination in the area.

===Towns disincorporated===
The Quabbin&#x27;s creation required the flooding, and thus the disincorporation, of four towns in April 1938: Dana (located in Worcester County), Enfield, Greenwich, and Prescott (all located in Hampshire County). The land remaining from the disincorporated towns was added to surrounding municipalities, including Belchertown, Pelham, New Salem, Petersham, Hardwick and Ware. One additional town on the reservoir is Shutesbury, in Franklin County. Because of New Salem&#x27;s annexation of the Prescott Peninsula, a large wedge of land shifted from Hampshire County to Franklin County. Today, the majority of the reservoir lies in either New Salem or Petersham.

Of the land used to make the dam, about 60,000 acres were purchased and the rest was seized by eminent domain in 1938. The town of Dana voted to voluntarily give up their land to the project. Around 2,500 residents lost their homes as part of the flooding.

In addition, thirty-six miles of the Boston and Albany Railroad&#x27;s Athol Branch, the so-called &quot;Rabbit Line&quot;, were abandoned (originally the Springfield, Athol and Northeastern Railroad). Route 21, formerly reaching Athol, was truncated to the south side of the reservoir, and new roads—now US 202 and Route 32A—were built, respectively, on the western and eastern side of the reservoir. The designation of Route 109 was removed in 1933 from the road once running from Pittsfield to West Brookfield and leading into Enfield Centre from the southeast; and a different road southwest of Boston received that designation.

The buildings in the towns flooded by the reservoir were removed. Some cellar holes were left intact while others, chiefly in Prescott and below the flow line, were filled in. Old roads that once led to the flooded towns can be followed to the water&#x27;s edge. Not all elements of the towns were destroyed, however. Town memorials and cemeteries in the four towns were moved to Quabbin Park Cemetery, located on Route 9 in Ware, just off the Quabbin&#x27;s lands. Many other public buildings were moved intact to other locations. For example, the Prescott First Congregational Church was moved to South Hadley. The North Prescott Methodist Episcopal Church was moved to Orange in 1949, and then to New Salem in 1985 where it forms part of the building complex of the Swift River Valley Historical Society. The former Town Hall of Prescott now sits off of Route 32 in Petersham.

Three student housing facilities at Hampshire College in Amherst are named after the discontinued towns of Greenwich, Prescott, and Enfield. In addition, Hampshire College named another facility on its campus Dana House, after the other discontinued town of Dana.

Four residence halls at the nearby Eagle Hill School are also named for the four towns: Greenwich, Prescott, Dana, and Enfield.

==Watershed public access and recreation==

To protect the water supply from the threats from unrestricted motorized vehicle use, most areas around the reservoir are publicly accessible only by foot, with limited parking available at some of the surrounding gates.

Large portions of Dana are on higher ground, and its remains, predominantly cellar holes, as well as the former town center (where a historic stone marker was placed) can be visited.

Much of Prescott is above water on what is now known as the Prescott Peninsula. However, Prescott cannot be visited most of the year due to state restrictions, although there is an annual tour of the town conducted by the Swift River Valley Historical Society. A few houses and roads exist which were once part of North Prescott (now New Salem), and there is a town line marker just north of the gates, indicating the former town line for Prescott. Cellar holes have been filled near the center of what was once Prescott to accommodate the former Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory, once operated by the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

There is a visitor center south of the reservoir, as well as an observation tower, and Enfield Lookout. This area—called Quabbin Park—is accessible by car from the south using State Route 9. The Park is a popular spot for hiking and other outdoor activities. This area was formerly part of the town of Enfield, which was annexed by Belchertown

Fishing is allowed in designated areas in the northern portions of the reservoir. Three boat launch areas are available, and to prevent spread of aquatic invasive species private boats must be cleaned before being permitted on the Reservoir. DCR provides a number of rental boats as well. Current Massachusetts state record lake trout (25 lb 7 oz) and walleye (11 lb 0 oz) were caught in the Quabbin.

More complete information regarding access rules and maps of Quabbin can be found on DCR&#x27;s official public access website.

===Natural resources and forest management===
This large block of forested land supports a great diversity of wildlife, and has been the focus for the re-establishment of several species in Massachusetts. Bald eagles, loons, moose, deer, coyotes, black bears, foxes, and bobcats share the habitat, among others. A proposed plan to establish a colony of endangered timber rattlesnakes to Mount Zion Island on the Quabbin was suspended indefinitely in 2017 after public opposition.

DWSP&#x27;s Watershed Forestry page provides general information regarding the application of forest management at Quabbin and other drinking water supply watersheds.

==Popular culture==
* H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; is set in the valley before it was flooded for the reservoir. His fictional town of Dunwich in &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, written in 1928, is partially based on the town of Greenwich (before reservoir plans were made).
* William Weld&#x27;s novel &quot;Stillwater&quot; is set in the valley while the reservoir is under construction. Weld relocates the already fictional Massachusetts town of Ripton, MA from the Berkshires to the Quabbin as a fifth flooded town.
* Both the film &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; and the Stephen King novel upon which it was based have scenes set at the Quabbin Reservoir.
* In Jane Langton&#x27;s mystery novel, &quot;Emily Dickinson is Dead&quot;, the drowned villages and the reservoir have a dark role to play.
* Jane Yolen&#x27;s picture book, &quot;Letting Swift River Go&quot;, is about the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir from the perspective of a young girl who grew up in the valley.
* During his 2020 Massachusetts Democratic primary campaign for U.S. Senate, former U.S. Representative Joe Kennedy III accused his rival, Sen. Ed Markey, of ignoring the towns of Dana, Prescott, and Enfield, which were disincorporated more than eighty years earlier.
* &quot;The Puma Blues&quot;, a black and white comic book series by Stephen Murphy and Michael Zulli, takes place in an alternate early 21st century and involves a colony of flying manta rays living within the freshwater reservoir.
* Heather Graham Pozzessere&#x27;s book &quot;Dark Rites&quot;, from her Krewe of Hunters series, takes place largely around the reservoir.
* Derek B. Miller&#x27;s book &quot;How to Find Your Way in the Dark&quot;, includes mention of the flooding that eliminated the drowned villages.
* In the film Mother/Android, the Quabbin Reservoir is mentioned several times as the characters navigate through a post-apocalyptic Massachusetts.

<text>IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is a collection of software written at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) geared towards the reduction of astronomical images and spectra in pixel array form. This is primarily data taken from imaging array detectors such as CCDs. It is available for all major operating systems for mainframes and desktop computers. IRAF was designed cross-platform, supporting VMS and UNIX-like operating systems. Use on Microsoft Windows was made possible by Cygwin in earlier versions, and can be today done with the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Today, it is primarily used on macOS and Linux.

IRAF commands (known as tasks) are organized into package structures. Additional packages may be added to IRAF. Packages may contain other packages. There are many packages available by NOAO and external developers often focusing on a particular branch of research or facility.

Functionality available in IRAF includes the calibration of the fluxes and positions of astronomical objects within an image, compensation for sensitivity variations between detector pixels, combination of multiple images or measurement of the redshifts of absorption or emission lines in a spectrum.

While IRAF is still very popular among astronomers, institutional development and maintenance was stopped. IRAF is now maintained as community software.

== History ==
The IRAF project started in fall 1981 at Kitt Peak National Observatory. In 1982, a preliminary design and the first version of the Command Language (CL) were completed. The IRAF Group was founded. Designer of the IRAF system and chief programmer was Doug Tody. In 1983, Space Telescope Science Institute selected IRAF as the environment for their SDAS data analysis system and ported the system to VMS. The first internal IRAF release was in 1984. After a limited distribution of a few outside sites the first public release was 1987.

In the middle of the 1990s, the &quot;Open IRAF&quot; project was started to address the problems that were seen at that time. This included language bindings, a way to use IRAF components without the full IRAF environment, new data types and dynamically loadable user code. This project was never completed.

At the end of the 1990s, the IRAF development slowed down considerably, as the system was considered mature. The user support was transferred to a Web forum in 2005 and new development of the core system was officially decreased to a very low level. However, voluntary work of the IRAF developers continued and they distributed some unofficial intermediary versions.

From 2006 to 2009, a first effort was made to port IRAF to 64 bit at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science Japan. While this effort did not evolve into a new official IRAF version, it contributed significant portions to the 64-bit port by NOAO.

NOAO resumed development efforts in 2007, porting the system to 64 bit and adding Virtual Observatory capabilities to it. This phase ended in 2013 with the release of version 2.16.1.

In 2017, the source code was transferred to GitHub. In an effort to package the IRAF software for Debian, it was cleaned up from the remaining non-free source code and is maintained solely by the community since then. After a few pre-releases, version 2.17 was released in early 2022. 

2023, NOIRLab (successor of NOAO) resumed some development and created their own release 2.18 with the scope limited to support the legacy Gemini data reduction pipeline. The relevant changes were later merged into the community release 2.18. 
== Licensing ==
The licensing of IRAF generally follows the MIT license scheme. Older versions contained some non-free software. In particular, the NCAR graphics code restricted re-distribution of IRAF before it was removed in version 2.16. Also, old versions used code taken from the Numerical Recipes book under a different license. This code was removed or replaced with Open Source in versions after 2.16.1. This allowed the distribution of IRAF packages in mainstream Linux distributions like Debian or Ubuntu.

== System design ==
Four basic components make up the run-time IRAF system:

* The Applications Packages are a structured collection of portable tasks for scientific data reduction and analysis, but also for system utilities.
* The Command Language (CL) is the default interactive user interface and is also used as scripting language for tasks in the application packages.
* The Virtual Operation System (VOS) provides a portable interface for the application tasks. It is modeled after the Unix system functions, but with an API for the IRAF specific Subset Preprocessor language (SPP).
* The Host System Interface (HSI) is the kernel providing an interface between the host system and the functions of the VOS. It also provides tools necessary for bootstrapping the system from source. The SPP compiler is also part of the HSI.
Only the HSI is system dependent. All other components are portable by the use of the functions provided by the HSI. This way, porting to a new system requires only changes in this component. However, the initial design was implicitly based on the universal use of 32-bit data types and therefore the port to 64 bit required major efforts not only in the HSI but in all components of the system.

== Application packages ==
Application Packages are recursively structured in subpackages and tasks. They can be divided into two classes: general system and basic dataprocessing utilities, and packages specific to astronomical data reduction and analysis. The tasks are dominantly written in SPP and CL.

=== System packages ===
The system packages are located in the base package of IRAF and provide tools for the CL, useful operating system utilities, and basic scientific utilities, f.e. for image processing:

; dataio: Data format conversion (FITS, IRAF image format etc.)
; images: General bitmap image processing and display
; lists: List processing
; plot: Vector graphics plotting utilities
; softools: Software development and system maintenance tools
; system: System utilities
; utilities: Miscellaneous utilities, including nttools to handle tables.

=== Optical astronomy packages ===
The noao packages are used for the analysis of optical astronomy data. Most of these tasks are general, but the imred package also contains data reduction tasks for specific instruments. Some of the important packages are:

; imred: Image reductions package, containing both general tasks for astronomical data reduction and for specific KPNO instruments
; artdata: Artificial data generation package. May generate artificial catalogs, 2D and 2D spectra, create images from artificial stars, galaxies, noise and cosmic rays etc. for testing purposes.
; astrometry: Astrometry package to obtain astrometric coordinates for objects in stellar fields
; digiphot: Digital stellar photometry package

; onedspec: One dimensional spectral data reduction and analysis package. One important task in this package is splot, a graphical tool for the analysis of spectra.
; twodspec: Two dimensional spectral reduction and analysis package, the same operations for two-dimensional spectra (longslit, multispec)
; surfphot: Galaxy isophotal analysis package
; astcat: Astronomical catalog and surveys access package

=== External packages ===
One strength of IRAF was the existence of various external packages, which resolved specific problems or implemented specialized data reduction pipelines. Among the packages are

; fitsutil: Utilities for single and multiple extension FITS files
; sptable: IRAF package for tabular spectra
; ctio: Tools for the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory
; stsdas: Software system from Space Telescope Science Institute for calibrating and analyzing data from the Hubble Space Telescope. The support of selected tasks from the stsdas package is continued in the st4gem package. The original tables package from STSci is now included as utilities.nttables in the system packages.
; stecf: IRAF tasks developed at the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility
; rvsao: Radial Velocity Package by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory
; wcstools: Image World Coordinate System Utilities by Jessica Mink
; AXe Spectral Extraction: Spectral extraction and visualization software to process large format astronomical slitless spectroscopic images such as those obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. The package consists of several tasks, each of which performs a specific reduction step on the data to produce the final, extracted spectra. The user can then analyse and control the spectra and, if necessary, re-run with slightly changed parameters until a satisfactory result is achieved. A deep ACS WFC grism image can contain detectable spectra of several thousands objects. Checking each individual spectrum is very tedious. To help users analyzing the full wealth of their data, the additional task aXe2web was developed to produce browsable web pages from reduced spectral data to enable many hundreds of spectra to be examined quickly and discerningly. The tool can be used for a quick look or as preview facilities in data pipelines, databases or even for virtual observatories.
; gemini: Data reduction pipeline for the Gemini Observatory

Many of these packages are however not maintained anymore. Porting to 64 bit also required significant effort and not all external packages were ported and therefore only usable in a 32-bit environment.

=== User-defined tasks ===
IRAF allows users to write their own tasks in two main ways. One is by writing non-compiled procedure (Command Language, CL) scripts. The second is through compiled subset pre-processor (SPP) programs. Tutorial documents exist for both methods.

== IRAF specific languages ==

=== Command language ===
The Command Language (CL), serves as a command and runtime supportive interface between the user at his computer terminal and the application programs he is executing. The user types his commands to the CL and it does whatever task and file manipulations are necessary to carry out the commands. In later versions, the original CL was extended to ECL, which has an editable command line as its main advantage. A version that enabled direct access to the Virtual Observatory (VOCL) was developed too.

The CL primarily serves as a shell and organizes the work with the system and the applications. There are three types of tasks the CL can execute: native tasks, which are part of compiled IRAF executables, scripts (CL tasks which are tasks written in CL), and foreign tasks, external programs or scripts that are executed by the CL. For each task, a parameter file may exist. It contains a description of each of the parameters used by the task that should be known and managed by the CL.

Here is a simple Hello World script in CL:
print(&#x27; Hello, world !! &#x27;)
CL scripts have usually the suffix codice_1, which may cause conflicts with Common Lisp code files.

=== Subset preprocessor language ===
The subset preprocessor language (SPP) implements a subset of the IRAF preprocessor language that was planned in the early days of IRAF. The SPP language is based on the Ratfor language. The lexical form, operators, and control flow constructs are identical to those provided by Ratfor. The major differences are the data types, the form of a procedure, the addition of inline strings and character constants, the use of square brackets for arrays, and the task statement. The i/o facilities provided are quite different.

The xc program, provided with IRAF, translates SPP programs into Fortran 66, and from there with f2c into C code.

The preprocessor is complemented with mkpkg, a make like build automation tool, generic, a tool to translate generic types into type dependent source code, and xyacc, a modified yacc to produce SPP output.

Here is a simple Hello World program in SPP:

task hello # CL callable task
procedure hello() # common procedure
begin
 call printf (&quot;hello, world\n&quot;)
end
SPP programs have usually the suffix codice_2, those which need to be preprocessed with the generic tool have codice_3.

==Supplementary software==
A full IRAF working environment usually requires two other applications: an extended xterm window with a graphics windows (called xgterm and distributed in a separate x11iraf package) and an image display program referred to as an &quot;image server&quot;. The two most popular image servers are &quot;SAOImageDS9&quot; (by SAO) and &quot;ximtool&quot; (NOAO, also distributed in the x11iraf package).

As an alternative of xgterm and the Command Language, the Python package PyRAF can be used. PyRAF is able to translate CL scripts into Python scripts. It also provides a graphics window (based on Tk or on Matplotlib). As command shell, either the Python or IPython command shell can be used, or a special mode resembling much of the look and feel of the CL command shell.

<doc id="520052" wikidata="Q332915" url="?curid=520052" title="J. R. Clynes">
<text>John Robert Clynes (27 March 1869 – 23 October 1949) was a British trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 35 years, and as Leader of the Labour Party (1921–1922), led the party in its breakthrough at the 1922 general election.

He was the first Englishman to serve as leader of the Labour Party.

==Early life==
The son of an Irish labourer named Patrick Clynes, he was born in Oldham, Lancashire, and began working in a local cotton mill when he was ten years old. Aged sixteen, he wrote a series of articles about child labour in the textile industry, and the following year he helped form the Piercers&#x27; Union. He was mainly self-educated, although he went to night school after his day&#x27;s work in the mill. His first book was a dictionary and then, by careful saving of coppers, he bought a Bible, William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, and Francis Bacon&#x27;s essays. Later in life, he would amaze colleagues in meetings and in parliamentary debates by quoting verbatim from the Bible, Shakespeare, John Milton and John Ruskin. He married Mary Elizabeth Harper, a mill worker, in 1893.

==Trade union and political involvement==
In 1892, Clynes became an organiser for the Lancashire Gasworkers&#x27; Union and came in contact with the Fabian Society. Having joined the Independent Labour Party, he attended the 1900 conference where the Labour Representation Committee was formed; this committee soon afterwards became the Labour Party.

Clynes stood for the new party in the 1906 general election and was elected to Parliament for Manchester North East, becoming one of Labour&#x27;s bright stars. In 1910, he became the party&#x27;s deputy chairman.

==Parliamentary career==
During the First World War, Clynes was a supporter of British military involvement (in which he differed from Ramsay MacDonald), and, in 1917, became Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Food Control in the Lloyd George coalition government. The next year, he was appointed Minister of Food Control and, at the 1918 general election, he was returned to Parliament for the Manchester Platting constituency.

In August 1917, three months before the Balfour Declaration, the Labour Party issued a statement in support of a Jewish state in Palestine. Clynes spoke in favor of a Jewish state.

Clynes became leader of the party in 1921 and led it through its major breakthrough in the 1922 general election. Before that election, Labour only had fifty-two seats in Parliament but, as a result of the election, Labour&#x27;s total number of seats rose to 142. He was held in considerable respect and affection in the Labour Party and, although lacking the charisma of MacDonald, was a wily operator who believed all resources available should be used to advance the material of the working classes.

MacDonald had resigned as Labour leader in 1914, due to his wartime pacifism, and at the 1918 general election, he lost his seat. He did not return to the House of Commons for another four years. By that stage, MacDonald&#x27;s pacifism had been forgiven. When the occupant of the Labour leadership had to be decided on through a vote of Labour parliamentarians, MacDonald narrowly defeated Clynes. Clynes was a critic of government policy towards the Irish population in the years after 1918, and attacked &#x27;a recurring system of coercion&#x27; which had left Ireland &quot;more angry and embittered . . . than ever&#x27;

==Governmental office==
When MacDonald became Prime Minister he made Clynes the party&#x27;s leader in the Commons until the government was defeated in 1924. During the second MacDonald government of 1929–1931, Clynes served as Home Secretary. In that role, Clynes gained literary prominence when he explained in the Commons his refusal to grant a visa
to the Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, then living in exile in Turkey, who had been invited by the Independent Labour Party to give a lecture in Britain. Clynes had then been immortalised by the scathing criticism of his concept of the right to asylum, voiced by Trotsky in the last chapter of his autobiography &quot;My Life&quot;, entitled &quot;The planet without visa&quot;.

In 1931, Clynes sided with Arthur Henderson and George Lansbury, against MacDonald&#x27;s support for austerity measures to deal with the Great Depression. Clynes split with MacDonald when the latter left Labour to form a National Government. In the 1931 election, Clynes was one of the casualties, losing his Manchester Platting seat. Nevertheless, he regained this constituency in 1935, and then remained in the House of Commons until his retirement ten years later, at the 1945 general election.

==Retirement and death==
After retiring, Clynes was living in very straitened circumstances, with no other income than trade union pension of £6 per week. This pension debarred him from the Commons Ex-Members Fund. Doctors&#x27; and nursing fees in respect of his invalid wife had hit him heavily. MPs opened a fund to help and raised about £1,000. Thus, after a lifetime spent in advancing the material conditions of the people, he died in relative poverty in October 1949. His wife died a month later.

==Honours==
* He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1918, giving him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* He was awarded the Freedom of the Borough of Oldham on 9 January 1946.
* He received the Honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law (DCL) from the University of Durham and the University of Oxford.
* John Clynes Court, a social housing development in Putney, south west London, is named after him.

<text>David Allison Dodge (born June 8, 1943) is a Canadian economist. He served as the seventh governor of the Bank of Canada from 2001 to 2008.

==Early life==

Dodge was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1943. He attended Ridley College, a private boarding school in St. Catharines (and second alumnus to become Bank Governor), and graduated from Queen&#x27;s University with an honours degree in economics. He received his Ph.D in economics from Princeton University in 1972 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;The structure of earnings of Canadian accountants, engineers and scientists and the implications for returns to investment in university education.&quot;

==Career==

He was Assistant Professor of Economics at Queen&#x27;s University, Associate Professor of Canadian Studies and International Economics at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, Senior Fellow in the Faculty of Commerce at the University of British Columbia, and visiting professor in the Department of Economics at Simon Fraser University. He has also served as Director of the International Economics Program of the Institute for Research on Public Policy.

=== Canadian Politics ===
Dodge served in the senior ranks of the Canadian federal government from 1992 to January 2001—one month before his appointment as Governor of the Bank of Canada.

==== Deputy Minister of Finance ====
He was appointed Deputy Minister of Finance in 1992. In the 1996 book &quot;Double Vision&quot;, Edward Greenspon and Anthony Wilson-Smith describe in detail the role which Dodge played in reviving Canada&#x27;s economy by working closely with Finance Minister Paul Martin to eliminate the federal budget&#x27;s deficit spending.

==== Deputy Minister of Health ====
In 1998, Dodge was appointed the Deputy Minister of Health. While Deputy, Dodge&#x27;s role in founding the Winnipeg National Microbiology Laboratory was commended as critically important by laboratory director-general Frank Plummer.

=== Bank of Canada ===
In 2001, Dodge was appointed the Governor of the Bank of Canada. His appointment was controversial as the Bank of Canada traditionally promotes from within, helping to avoid the perception of politicizing of the central bank. During Dodge&#x27;s term, annual inflation stayed close to the Bank of Canada&#x27;s target of 2 percent, and the Canadian economy avoided any recessions. In 2008, Dodge retired from the Bank of Canada, and was replaced by Mark Carney.

Following his exit from the Bank, Dodge joined the Canadian law firm Bennett Jones as a senior advisor.

=== Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University ===
Dodge was elected as the 13th chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University on May 2, 2008, succeeding A. Charles Baillie. The appointment was effective July 1, 2008, though Dodge was only officially installed later that year, on October 30. As his first three-year term drew to a close, Dodge&#x27;s re-appointment was unanimously endorsed by the Queen&#x27;s University Council, and Dodge served until his retirement at the end of his second-term on June 30, 2014. He was subsequently appointed chancellor emeritus by the University Council, an honorary title he still holds today.

Dodge was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in October, 2009.

He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2007.

<doc id="520066" wikidata="Q467928" url="?curid=520066" title="History of cryptography">
<text>Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago. Until recent decades, it has been the story of what might be called classical cryptography — that is, of methods of encryption that use pen and paper, or perhaps simple mechanical aids. In the early 20th century, the invention of complex mechanical and electromechanical machines, such as the Enigma rotor machine, provided more sophisticated and efficient means of encryption; and the subsequent introduction of electronics and computing has allowed elaborate schemes of still greater complexity, most of which are entirely unsuited to pen and paper.

The development of cryptography has been paralleled by the development of cryptanalysis — the &quot;breaking&quot; of codes and ciphers. The discovery and application, early on, of frequency analysis to the reading of encrypted communications has, on occasion, altered the course of history. Thus the Zimmermann Telegram triggered the United States&#x27; entry into World War I; and Allies reading of Nazi Germany&#x27;s ciphers shortened World War II, in some evaluations by as much as two years.

Until the 1960s, secure cryptography was largely the preserve of governments. Two events have since brought it squarely into the public domain: the creation of a public encryption standard (DES), and the invention of public-key cryptography.

== Antiquity ==

The earliest known use of cryptography is found in non-standard hieroglyphs carved into the wall of a tomb from the Old Kingdom of Egypt circa 1900 BC. These are not thought to be serious attempts at secret communications, however, but rather to have been attempts at mystery, intrigue, or even amusement for literate onlookers.

Some clay tablets from Mesopotamia somewhat later are clearly meant to protect information—one dated near 1500 BC was found to encrypt a craftsman&#x27;s recipe for pottery glaze, presumably commercially valuable. Furthermore, Hebrew scholars made use of simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers (such as the Atbash cipher) beginning perhaps around 600 to 500 BC.

In India around 400 BC to 200 AD, Mlecchita vikalpa or &quot;the art of understanding writing in cypher, and the writing of words in a peculiar way&quot; was documented in the Kama Sutra for the purpose of communication between lovers. This was also likely a simple substitution cipher. Parts of the Egyptian demotic Greek Magical Papyri were written in a cypher script.

The ancient Greeks are said to have known of ciphers. The scytale transposition cipher was used by the Spartan military, but it is not definitively known whether the scytale was for encryption, authentication, or avoiding bad omens in speech. Herodotus tells us of secret messages physically concealed beneath wax on wooden tablets or as a tattoo on a slave&#x27;s head concealed by regrown hair, although these are not properly examples of cryptography &quot;per se&quot; as the message, once known, is directly readable; this is known as steganography. Another Greek method was developed by Polybius (now called the &quot;Polybius Square&quot;). The Romans knew something of cryptography (e.g., the Caesar cipher and its variations).

== Medieval cryptography ==
David Kahn notes in &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the &quot;Book of Cryptographic Messages&quot;, which contains the first use of to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.

The invention of the frequency analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, by Al-Kindi, an Arab mathematician, sometime around AD 800, proved to be the single most significant cryptanalytic advance until World War II. Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled &quot;Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu&#x27;amma&quot; (&quot;Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot;), in which he described the first cryptanalytic techniques, including some for polyalphabetic ciphers, cipher classification, Arabic phonetics and syntax, and most importantly, gave the first descriptions on frequency analysis. He also covered methods of encipherments, cryptanalysis of certain encipherments, and statistical analysis of letters and letter combinations in Arabic. An important contribution of Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) was on sample size for use of frequency analysis.

In early medieval England between the years 800–1100, substitution ciphers were frequently used by scribes as a playful and clever way to encipher notes, solutions to riddles, and colophons. The ciphers tend to be fairly straightforward, but sometimes they deviate from an ordinary pattern, adding to their complexity, and possibly also to their sophistication. This period saw vital and significant cryptographic experimentation in the West.

Ahmad al-Qalqashandi (AD 1355–1418) wrote the &quot;Subh al-a &#x27;sha&quot;, a 14-volume encyclopedia which included a section on cryptology. This information was attributed to Ibn al-Durayhim who lived from AD 1312 to 1361, but whose writings on cryptography have been lost. The list of ciphers in this work included both substitution and transposition, and for the first time, a polyalphabetic cipher with multiple substitutions for each plaintext letter (later called homophonic substitution). Also traced to Ibn al-Durayhim is an exposition on and a worked example of cryptanalysis, including the use of tables of letter frequencies and sets of letters which cannot occur together in one word.

The earliest example of the homophonic substitution cipher is the one used by Duke of Mantua in the early 1400s. Homophonic cipher replaces each letter with multiple symbols depending on the letter frequency. The cipher is ahead of the time because it combines monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic features.

Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to the cryptanalytic technique of frequency analysis until the development of the polyalphabetic cipher, and many remained so thereafter. The polyalphabetic cipher was most clearly explained by Leon Battista Alberti around AD 1467, for which he was called the &quot;father of Western cryptology&quot;. Johannes Trithemius, in his work Poligraphia, invented the tabula recta, a critical component of the Vigenère cipher. Trithemius also wrote the &quot;Steganographia&quot;. Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553 first described the cipher that would become known in the 19th century as the Vigenère cipher, misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère.
In Europe, cryptography became (secretly) more important as a consequence of political competition and religious revolution. For instance, in Europe during and after the Renaissance, citizens of the various Italian states—the Papal States and the Roman Catholic Church included—were responsible for rapid proliferation of cryptographic techniques, few of which reflect understanding (or even knowledge) of Alberti&#x27;s polyalphabetic advance. &quot;Advanced ciphers&quot;, even after Alberti, were not as advanced as their inventors/developers/users claimed (and probably even they themselves believed). They were frequently broken. This over-optimism may be inherent in cryptography, for it was then – and remains today – difficult in principle to know how vulnerable one&#x27;s own system is. In the absence of knowledge, guesses and hopes are predictably common.

Cryptography, cryptanalysis, and secret-agent/courier betrayal featured in the Babington plot during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I which led to the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. Robert Hooke suggested in the chapter &quot;Of Dr. Dee&#x27;s Book of Spirits&quot;, that John Dee made use of Trithemian steganography, to conceal his communication with Queen Elizabeth I.

The chief cryptographer of King Louis XIV of France was Antoine Rossignol; he and his family created what is known as the Great Cipher because it remained unsolved from its initial use until 1890, when French military cryptanalyst, Étienne Bazeries solved it. An encrypted message from the time of the Man in the Iron Mask (decrypted just prior to 1900 by Étienne Bazeries) has shed some, regrettably non-definitive, light on the identity of that real, if legendary and unfortunate, prisoner.

Outside of Europe, after the Mongols brought about the end of the Islamic Golden Age, cryptography remained comparatively undeveloped. Cryptography in Japan seems not to have been used until about 1510, and advanced techniques were not known until after the opening of the country to the West beginning in the 1860s.

== Cryptography from 1800 to World War I ==

Although cryptography has a long and complex history, it wasn&#x27;t until the 19th century that it developed anything more than ad hoc approaches to either encryption or cryptanalysis (the science of finding weaknesses in crypto systems). Examples of the latter include Charles Babbage&#x27;s Crimean War era work on mathematical cryptanalysis of polyalphabetic ciphers, redeveloped and published somewhat later by the Prussian Friedrich Kasiski. Understanding of cryptography at this time typically consisted of hard-won rules of thumb; see, for example, Auguste Kerckhoffs&#x27; cryptographic writings in the latter 19th century. Edgar Allan Poe used systematic methods to solve ciphers in the 1840s. In particular he placed a notice of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Weekly (Express) Messenger&quot;, inviting submissions of ciphers, most of which he proceeded to solve. His success created a public stir for some months. He later wrote an essay on methods of cryptography which proved useful as an introduction for novice British cryptanalysts attempting to break German codes and ciphers during World War I, and a famous story, &quot;The Gold-Bug&quot;, in which cryptanalysis was a prominent element.

Cryptography, and its misuse, were involved in the execution of Mata Hari and in Dreyfus&#x27; conviction and imprisonment, both in the early 20th century. Cryptographers were also involved in exposing the machinations which had led to the Dreyfus affair; Mata Hari, in contrast, was shot.

In World War I the Admiralty&#x27;s Room 40 broke German naval codes and played an important role in several naval engagements during the war, notably in detecting major German sorties into the North Sea that led to the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland as the British fleet was sent out to intercept them. However, its most important contribution was probably in decrypting the Zimmermann Telegram, a cable from the German Foreign Office sent via Washington to its ambassador Heinrich von Eckardt in Mexico which played a major part in bringing the United States into the war.

In 1917, Gilbert Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the cyphertext. This led to the development of electromechanical devices as cipher machines, and to the only unbreakable cipher, the one time pad.

During the 1920s, Polish naval-officers assisted the Japanese military with code and cipher development.

Mathematical methods proliferated in the period prior to World War II (notably in William F. Friedman&#x27;s application of statistical techniques to cryptanalysis and cipher development and in Marian Rejewski&#x27;s initial break into the German Army&#x27;s version of the Enigma system in 1932).

== World War II cryptography ==

By World War II, mechanical and electromechanical cipher machines were in wide use, although—where such machines were impractical—code books and manual systems continued in use. Great advances were made in both cipher design and cryptanalysis, all in secrecy. Information about this period has begun to be declassified as the official British 50-year secrecy period has come to an end, as US archives have slowly opened, and as assorted memoirs and articles have appeared.

===Germany===
The Germans made heavy use, in several variants, of an electromechanical rotor machine known as Enigma. Mathematician Marian Rejewski, at Poland&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, in December 1932 deduced the detailed structure of the German Army Enigma, using mathematics and limited documentation supplied by Captain Gustave Bertrand of French military intelligence acquired from a German clerk. This &quot;was one of the great achievements of cryptology,&quot; according to historian David Kahn. Rejewski and his mathematical Cipher Bureau colleagues, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski, continued reading Enigma and keeping pace with the evolution of the German Army machine&#x27;s components and encipherment procedures for some time. As the Poles&#x27; resources became strained by the changes being introduced by the Germans, and as war loomed, the Cipher Bureau, on the Polish General Staff&#x27;s instructions, on 25 July 1939, at Warsaw, initiated French and British intelligence representatives into the secrets of Enigma decryption.

Soon after the invasion of Poland by Germany on 1 September 1939, key Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated southeastward; on 17 September, as the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the East, they crossed into Romania. From there they reached Paris, France; at PC Bruno, near Paris, they continued working toward breaking Enigma, collaborating with British cryptologists at Bletchley Park as the British got up to speed on their work breaking Enigma. In due course, the British cryptographerswhose ranks included many chess masters and mathematics dons such as Gordon Welchman, Max Newman, and Alan Turing (the conceptual founder of modern computing) made substantial breakthroughs in the scale and technology of Enigma decryption.

German code breaking in World War II also had some success, most importantly by breaking the Naval Cipher No. 3. This enabled them to track and sink Atlantic convoys. It was only Ultra intelligence that finally persuaded the admiralty to change their codes in June 1943. This is surprising given the success of the British Room 40 code breakers in the previous world war.

At the end of the War, on 19 April 1945, Britain&#x27;s highest level civilian and military officials were told that they could never reveal that the German Enigma cipher had been broken because it would give the defeated enemy the chance to say they &quot;were not well and fairly beaten&quot;.

The German military also deployed several teleprinter stream ciphers. Bletchley Park called them the Fish ciphers; Max Newman and colleagues designed and deployed the Heath Robinson, and then the world&#x27;s first programmable digital electronic computer, the Colossus, to help with their cryptanalysis. The German Foreign Office began to use the one-time pad in 1919; some of this traffic was read in World War II partly as the result of recovery of some key material in South America that was discarded without sufficient care by a German courier.

The &quot;Schlüsselgerät 41&quot; was developed late in the war as a more secure replacement for Enigma, but only saw limited use.

===Japan===
A US Army group, the SIS, managed to break the highest security Japanese diplomatic cipher system (an electromechanical stepping switch machine called Purple by the Americans) in 1940, before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The locally developed Purple machine replaced the earlier &quot;Red&quot; machine used by the Japanese Foreign Ministry, and a related machine, the M-1, used by Naval attachés which was broken by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Agnes Driscoll. All the Japanese machine ciphers were broken, to one degree or another, by the Allies.

The Japanese Navy and Army largely used code book systems, later with a separate numerical additive. US Navy cryptographers (with cooperation from British and Dutch cryptographers after 1940) broke into several Japanese Navy crypto systems. The break into one of them, JN-25, famously led to the US victory in the Battle of Midway; and to the publication of that fact in the Chicago Tribune shortly after the battle, though the Japanese seem not to have noticed for they kept using the JN-25 system.

===Allies===
The Americans referred to the intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, perhaps especially that from the Purple machine, as &#x27;Magic&#x27;. The British eventually settled on &#x27;Ultra&#x27; for intelligence resulting from cryptanalysis, particularly that from message traffic protected by the various Enigmas. An earlier British term for Ultra had been &#x27;Boniface&#x27; in an attempt to suggest, if betrayed, that it might have an individual agent as a source.
Allied cipher machines used in World War II included the British TypeX and the American SIGABA; both were electromechanical rotor designs similar in spirit to the Enigma, albeit with major improvements. Neither is known to have been broken by anyone during the War. The Poles used the Lacida machine, but its security was found to be less than intended (by Polish Army cryptographers in the UK), and its use was discontinued. US troops in the field used the M-209 and the still less secure M-94 family machines. British SOE agents initially used &#x27;poem ciphers&#x27; (memorized poems were the encryption/decryption keys), but later in the War, they began to switch to one-time pads.

The VIC cipher (used at least until 1957 in connection with Rudolf Abel&#x27;s NY spy ring) was a very complex hand cipher, and is claimed to be the most complicated known to have been used by the Soviets, according to David Kahn in &quot;Kahn on Codes&quot;. For the decrypting of Soviet ciphers (particularly when &quot;one-time pads&quot; were reused), see Venona project.

===Role of women===
The UK and US employed large numbers of women in their code-breaking operation, with close to 7,000 reporting to Bletchley Park 
and 11,000 to the separate US Army and Navy operations, around Washington, DC. By tradition in Japan and Nazi doctrine in Germany, women were excluded from war work, at least until late in the war. Even after encryption systems were broken, large amounts of work were needed to respond to changes made, recover daily key settings for multiple networks, and intercept, process, translate, prioritize and analyze the huge volume of enemy messages generated in a global conflict. A few women, including Elizabeth Friedman and Agnes Meyer Driscoll, had been major contributors to US code-breaking in the 1930s and the Navy and Army began actively recruiting top graduates of women&#x27;s colleges shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Liza Mundy argues that this disparity in utilizing the talents of women between the Allies and Axis made a strategic difference in the war.

==Modern cryptography==
Encryption in modern times is achieved by using algorithms that have a key to encrypt and decrypt information. These keys convert the messages and data into &quot;digital gibberish&quot; through encryption and then return them to the original form through decryption. In general, the longer the key is, the more difficult it is to crack the code. This holds true because deciphering an encrypted message by brute force would require the attacker to try every possible key. To put this in context, each binary unit of information, or bit, has a value of 0 or 1. An 8-bit key would then have 256 or 2^8 possible keys. A 56-bit key would have 2^56, or 72 quadrillion, possible keys to try and decipher the message. With modern technology, cyphers using keys with these lengths are becoming easier to decipher. DES, an early US Government approved cypher, has an effective key length of 56 bits, and test messages using that cypher have been broken by brute force key search. However, as technology advances, so does the quality of encryption. Since World War II, one of the most notable advances in the study of cryptography is the introduction of the asymmetric key cyphers (sometimes termed public-key cyphers). These are algorithms which use two mathematically related keys for encryption of the same message. Some of these algorithms permit publication of one of the keys, due to it being extremely difficult to determine one key simply from knowledge of the other.

Beginning around 1990, the use of the Internet for commercial purposes and the introduction of commercial transactions over the Internet called for a widespread standard for encryption. Before the introduction of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), information sent over the Internet, such as financial data, was encrypted if at all, most commonly using the Data Encryption Standard (DES). This had been approved by NBS (a US Government agency) for its security, after public call for, and a competition among, candidates for such a cypher algorithm. DES was approved for a short period, but saw extended use due to complex wrangles over the use by the public of high quality encryption. DES was finally replaced by the AES after another public competition organized by the NBS successor agency, NIST. Around the late 1990s to early 2000s, the use of public-key algorithms became a more common approach for encryption, and soon a hybrid of the two schemes became the most accepted way for e-commerce operations to proceed. Additionally, the creation of a new protocol known as the Secure Socket Layer, or SSL, led the way for online transactions to take place. Transactions ranging from purchasing goods to online bill pay and banking used SSL. Furthermore, as wireless Internet connections became more common among households, the need for encryption grew, as a level of security was needed in these everyday situations.

===Claude Shannon===
Claude E. Shannon is considered by many to be the father of mathematical cryptography. Shannon worked for several years at Bell Labs, and during his time there, he produced an article entitled &quot;A mathematical theory of cryptography&quot;. This article was written in 1945 and eventually was published in the Bell System Technical Journal in 1949. It is commonly accepted that this paper was the starting point for development of modern cryptography. Shannon was inspired during the war to address &quot;[t]he problems of cryptography [because] secrecy systems furnish an interesting application of communication theory&quot;. Shannon identified the two main goals of cryptography: secrecy and authenticity. His focus was on exploring secrecy and thirty-five years later, G.J. Simmons would address the issue of authenticity. Shannon wrote a further article entitled &quot;A mathematical theory of communication&quot; which highlights one of the most significant aspects of his work: cryptography&#x27;s transition from art to science.

In his works, Shannon described the two basic types of systems for secrecy. The first are those designed with the intent to protect against hackers and attackers who have infinite resources with which to decode a message (theoretical secrecy, now unconditional security), and the second are those designed to protect against hackers and attacks with finite resources with which to decode a message (practical secrecy, now computational security). Most of Shannon&#x27;s work focused around theoretical secrecy; here, Shannon introduced a definition for the &quot;unbreakability&quot; of a cipher. If a cipher was determined &quot;unbreakable&quot;, it was considered to have &quot;perfect secrecy&quot;. In proving &quot;perfect secrecy&quot;, Shannon determined that this could only be obtained with a secret key whose length given in binary digits was greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in the information being encrypted. Furthermore, Shannon developed the &quot;unicity distance&quot;, defined as the &quot;amount of plaintext that… determines the secret key.&quot;

Shannon&#x27;s work influenced further cryptography research in the 1970s, as the public-key cryptography developers, M. E. Hellman and W. Diffie cited Shannon&#x27;s research as a major influence. His work also impacted modern designs of secret-key ciphers. At the end of Shannon&#x27;s work with cryptography, progress slowed until Hellman and Diffie introduced their paper involving &quot;public-key cryptography&quot;.

===An encryption standard===
The mid-1970s saw two major public (i.e., non-secret) advances. First was the publication of the draft Data Encryption Standard in the U.S. &quot;Federal Register&quot; on 17 March 1975. The proposed DES cipher was submitted by a research group at IBM, at the invitation of the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), in an effort to develop secure electronic communication facilities for businesses such as banks and other large financial organizations. After advice and modification by the NSA, acting behind the scenes, it was adopted and published as a Federal Information Processing Standard Publication in 1977 (currently at FIPS 46-3). DES was the first publicly accessible cipher to be &#x27;blessed&#x27; by a national agency such as the NSA. The release of its specification by NBS stimulated an explosion of public and academic interest in cryptography.

The aging DES was officially replaced by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001 when NIST announced FIPS 197. After an open competition, NIST selected Rijndael, submitted by two Belgian cryptographers, to be the AES. DES, and more secure variants of it (such as Triple DES), are still used today, having been incorporated into many national and organizational standards. However, its 56-bit key-size has been shown to be insufficient to guard against brute force attacks (one such attack, undertaken by the cyber civil-rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1997, succeeded in 56 hours.) As a result, use of straight DES encryption is now without doubt insecure for use in new cryptosystem designs, and messages protected by older cryptosystems using DES, and indeed all messages sent since 1976 using DES, are also at risk. Regardless of DES&#x27; inherent quality, the DES key size (56-bits) was thought to be too small by some even in 1976, perhaps most publicly by Whitfield Diffie. There was suspicion that government organizations even then had sufficient computing power to break DES messages; clearly others have achieved this capability.

===Public key===
The second development, in 1976, was perhaps even more important, for it fundamentally changed the way cryptosystems might work. This was the publication of the paper New Directions in Cryptography by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. It introduced a radically new method of distributing cryptographic keys, which went far toward solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography, key distribution, and has become known as Diffie–Hellman key exchange. The article also stimulated the almost immediate public development of a new class of enciphering algorithms, the asymmetric key algorithms.

Prior to that time, all useful modern encryption algorithms had been symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret. All of the electromechanical machines used in World War II were of this logical class, as were the Caesar and Atbash ciphers and essentially all cipher systems throughout history. The &#x27;key&#x27; for a code is, of course, the codebook, which must likewise be distributed and kept secret, and so shares most of the same problems in practice.

Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system (the term usually used is &#x27;via a secure channel&#x27;) such as a trustworthy courier with a briefcase handcuffed to a wrist, or face-to-face contact, or a loyal carrier pigeon. This requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases, or when secure channels aren&#x27;t available for key exchange, or when, as is sensible cryptographic practice, keys are frequently changed. In particular, if messages are meant to be secure from other users, a separate key is required for each possible pair of users. A system of this kind is known as a secret key, or symmetric key cryptosystem. D-H key exchange (and succeeding improvements and variants) made operation of these systems much easier, and more secure, than had ever been possible before in all of history.

In contrast, asymmetric key encryption uses a pair of mathematically related keys, each of which decrypts the encryption performed using the other. Some, but not all, of these algorithms have the additional property that one of the paired keys cannot be deduced from the other by any known method other than trial and error. An algorithm of this kind is known as a public key or asymmetric key system. Using such an algorithm, only one key pair is needed per user. By designating one key of the pair as private (always secret), and the other as public (often widely available), no secure channel is needed for key exchange. So long as the private key stays secret, the public key can be widely known for a very long time without compromising security, making it safe to reuse the same key pair indefinitely.

For two users of an asymmetric key algorithm to communicate securely over an insecure channel, each user will need to know their own public and private keys as well as the other user&#x27;s public key. Take this basic scenario: Alice and Bob each have a pair of keys they&#x27;ve been using for years with many other users. At the start of their message, they exchange public keys, unencrypted over an insecure line. Alice then encrypts a message using her private key, and then re-encrypts that result using Bob&#x27;s public key. The double-encrypted message is then sent as digital data over a wire from Alice to Bob. Bob receives the bit stream and decrypts it using his own private key, and then decrypts that bit stream using Alice&#x27;s public key. If the final result is recognizable as a message, Bob can be confident that the message actually came from someone who knows Alice&#x27;s private key (presumably actually her if she&#x27;s been careful with her private key), and that anyone eavesdropping on the channel will need Bob&#x27;s private key in order to understand the message.

Asymmetric algorithms rely for their effectiveness on a class of problems in mathematics called one-way functions, which require relatively little computational power to execute, but vast amounts of power to reverse, if reversal is possible at all. A classic example of a one-way function is multiplication of very large prime numbers. It&#x27;s fairly quick to multiply two large primes, but very difficult to find the factors of the product of two large primes. Because of the mathematics of one-way functions, most possible keys are bad choices as cryptographic keys; only a small fraction of the possible keys of a given length are suitable, and so asymmetric algorithms require very long keys to reach the same level of security provided by relatively shorter symmetric keys. The need to both generate the key pairs, and perform the encryption/decryption operations make asymmetric algorithms computationally expensive, compared to most symmetric algorithms. Since symmetric algorithms can often use any sequence of (random, or at least unpredictable) bits as a key, a disposable &quot;session key&quot; can be quickly generated for short-term use. Consequently, it is common practice to use a long asymmetric key to exchange a disposable, much shorter (but just as strong) symmetric key. The slower asymmetric algorithm securely sends a symmetric session key, and the faster symmetric algorithm takes over for the remainder of the message.

Asymmetric key cryptography, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, and the best known of the public key / private key algorithms (i.e., what is usually called the RSA algorithm), all seem to have been independently developed at a UK intelligence agency before the public announcement by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. GCHQ has released documents claiming they had developed public key cryptography before the publication of Diffie and Hellman&#x27;s paper. Various classified papers were written at GCHQ during the 1960s and 1970s which eventually led to schemes essentially identical to RSA encryption and to Diffie–Hellman key exchange in 1973 and 1974. Some of these have now been published, and the inventors (James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks, and Malcolm Williamson) have made public (some of) their work.

===Hashing===
Hashing is a common technique used in cryptography to encode information quickly using typical algorithms. Generally, an algorithm is applied to a string of text, and the resulting string becomes the &quot;hash value&quot;. This creates a &quot;digital fingerprint&quot; of the message, as the specific hash value is used to identify a specific message. The output from the algorithm is also referred to as a &quot;message digest&quot; or a &quot;check sum&quot;. Hashing is good for determining if information has been changed in transmission. If the hash value is different upon reception than upon sending, there is evidence the message has been altered. Once the algorithm has been applied to the data to be hashed, the hash function produces a fixed-length output. Essentially, anything passed through the hash function should resolve to the same length output as anything else passed through the same hash function. It is important to note that hashing is not the same as encrypting. Hashing is a one-way operation that is used to transform data into the compressed message digest. Additionally, the integrity of the message can be measured with hashing. Conversely, encryption is a two-way operation that is used to transform plaintext into cipher-text and then vice versa. In encryption, the confidentiality of a message is guaranteed.

Hash functions can be used to verify digital signatures, so that when signing documents via the Internet, the signature is applied to one particular individual. Much like a hand-written signature, these signatures are verified by assigning their exact hash code to a person. Furthermore, hashing is applied to passwords for computer systems. Hashing for passwords began with the UNIX operating system. A user on the system would first create a password. That password would be hashed, using an algorithm or key, and then stored in a password file. This is still prominent today, as web applications that require passwords will often hash user&#x27;s passwords and store them in a database.

===Cryptography politics===
The public developments of the 1970s broke the near monopoly on high quality cryptography held by government organizations (see S Levy&#x27;s &quot;Crypto&quot; for a journalistic account of some of the policy controversy of the time in the US). For the first time ever, those outside government organizations had access to cryptography not readily breakable by anyone (including governments). Considerable controversy, and conflict, both public and private, began more or less immediately, sometimes called the crypto wars. They have not yet subsided. In many countries, for example, export of cryptography is subject to restrictions. Until 1996 export from the U.S. of cryptography using keys longer than 40 bits (too small to be very secure against a knowledgeable attacker) was sharply limited. As recently as 2004, former FBI Director Louis Freeh, testifying before the 9/11 Commission, called for new laws against public use of encryption.

One of the most significant people favoring strong encryption for public use was Phil Zimmermann. He wrote and then in 1991 released PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a very high quality crypto system. He distributed a freeware version of PGP when he felt threatened by legislation then under consideration by the US Government that would require backdoors to be included in all cryptographic products developed within the US. His system was released worldwide shortly after he released it in the US, and that began a long criminal investigation of him by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for the alleged violation of export restrictions. The DOJ eventually dropped its case against Zimmermann, and the freeware distribution of PGP has continued around the world. PGP even eventually became an open Internet standard (RFC 2440 or OpenPGP).

===Modern cryptanalysis===
While modern ciphers like AES and the higher quality asymmetric ciphers are widely considered unbreakable, poor designs and implementations are still sometimes adopted and there have been important cryptanalytic breaks of deployed crypto systems in recent years. Notable examples of broken crypto designs include the first Wi-Fi encryption scheme WEP, the Content Scrambling System used for encrypting and controlling DVD use, the A5/1 and A5/2 ciphers used in GSM cell phones, and the CRYPTO1 cipher used in the widely deployed MIFARE Classic smart cards from NXP Semiconductors, a spun off division of Philips Electronics. All of these are symmetric ciphers. Thus far, not one of the mathematical ideas underlying public key cryptography has been proven to be &#x27;unbreakable&#x27;, and so some future mathematical analysis advance might render systems relying on them insecure. While few informed observers foresee such a breakthrough, the key size recommended for security as best practice keeps increasing as increased computing power required for breaking codes becomes cheaper and more available. Quantum computers, if ever constructed with enough capacity, could break existing public key algorithms and efforts are underway to develop and standardize post-quantum cryptography.

Even without breaking encryption in the traditional sense, side-channel attacks can be mounted that exploit information gained from the way a computer system is implemented, such as cache memory usage, timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks or even sounds emitted. Newer cryptographic algorithms are being developed that make such attacks more difficult.

<text>The dinar (, ; paucal: dinara / динара; abbreviation:  (Latin) and дин (Cyrillic); code: RSD) is the currency of Serbia. The dinar was first used in Serbia in medieval times, its earliest use dating back to 1214. The dinar was reintroduced as the official Serbian currency by Prince Mihailo in the 1868. One dinar was formerly subdivided into 100 para. As of 24 August 2024, 1 US dollar is worth 104.57 dinars.

==History==
===Medieval Serbian dinar===
The first mention of a &quot;Serbian dinar&quot; dates back to the reign of Stefan Nemanjić in 1214. Until the fall of Despot Stjepan Tomašević in 1459, most of the Serbian rulers minted silver dinar coins. 
The first Serbian dinars, like many other south-European coins, replicated Venetian grosso, including characters in Latin (the word &#x27;Dux&#x27; replaced with the word &#x27;Rex&#x27;). It was one of the main export articles of medieval Serbia for many years, considering the relative abundance of silver coming from Serbian mines. Venetians were wary of this, and Dante Alighieri went so far as to put the Serbian king of his time, Stephen Uroš II Milutin of Serbia, in Hell as a forger (along with his Portuguese and Norwegian counterparts):
===First modern Serbian dinar (1868–1920)===
Following the Ottoman conquest, different foreign currencies were used up to the mid-19th century. The Ottomans operated coin mints in Novo Brdo, Kučajna and Belgrade. The subdivision of the dinar, the , is named after the Turkish silver coins of the same name (from the Persian , &#x27;money, coin&#x27;). 
After the Principality of Serbia was formally established (1817), there were many different foreign coins in circulation. Eventually, Prince Miloš Obrenović decided to introduce some order by establishing exchange rates based on the groat (Serbian , French and English , Turkish , ) as money of account. In 1819 Prince Miloš Obrenović published a table rating 43 different foreign coins: 10 gold, 28 silver, and 5 copper.

After the last Ottoman garrisons were withdrawn in 1867, Serbia was faced with multiple currencies in circulation. Thus, the prince Mihailo Obrenović ordered a national currency be minted. 
The first bronze coins were introduced in 1868, followed by silver in 1875 and gold in 1879. The first banknotes were issued in 1876. Between 1873 and 1894, the dinar was pegged at par to the French franc. The Kingdom of Serbia also joined the Latin Monetary Union and adhered to a bimetallic standard up until 1914. Attempts to put the Serbian dinar solely onto the gold standard were hampered by widening budget deficits, significant government foreign debt and poor gold reserves.

In 1920, the Serbian dinar was replaced at par by the Yugoslav dinar, with the Yugoslav krone also circulating together.
====Coins====
In 1868, bronze coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, and 10 paras. The obverses featured the portrait of Prince Mihailo Obrenović III. Silver coins were introduced in 1875, in denominations of 50 paras, 1 and 2 dinars, followed by 5 dinars in 1879. The first gold coins were also issued in 1879, for 20 dinars, with 10 dinars introduced in 1882. The gold coins issued for the coronation of Milan I coronation in 1882 were popularly called (). In 1883, cupro-nickel 5, 10, and 20 para coins were introduced, followed by bronze 2 para coins in 1904.

====Banknotes====
In 1876, state notes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 dinars. The Chartered National Bank followed these notes from 1884, with notes for 10 dinars backed by silver and gold notes for 50 and 100 dinars. Gold notes for 20 dinars and silver notes for 100 dinars were introduced in 1905. However, gold-backed notes were not received well by the public. Lack of public faith in the Serbian dinar, bartering and immediate exchange for gold coins meant that the notes fell out of circulation. Silver-backed notes were however well received and made up 95% of total note circulation. During the Balkan Wars and on the eve of World War I, bank note conversions to gold and silver were temporarily suspended. During World War I, silver notes for 50 and 5 dinars were introduced in 1914 and 1916, respectively. In 1915, stamps were authorized for circulation as currency in denominations of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 50 paras.

===Second modern Serbian dinar (1941–1944)===
In 1941, the Yugoslav dinar was replaced, at par, by a second Serbian dinar for use in the German occupied Serbia. The dinar was pegged to the German reichsmark at a rate of 250 dinars = 1 reichsmark. This dinar circulated until 1944, when the Yugoslav dinar was reintroduced by the Yugoslav Partisans, replacing the Serbian dinar rate of 1 Yugoslav dinar = 20 Serbian dinars.

====Coins====
In 1942, zinc coins were introduced in denominations of 50 paras, 1 and 2 dinars, with 10 dinar coins following in 1943.

====Banknotes====
In May 1941, the Serbian National Bank introduced notes for 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 dinars. The 100 and 1,000 dinar notes were overprints, whilst the 10 dinar design was taken from an earlier Yugoslav note. Other notes were introduced in 1942 and 1943 without any new denominations being introduced.

===Third modern Serbian dinar (2003–present)===
The Serbian dinar replaced the Yugoslav dinar in 2003 when the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was transformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. Both Montenegro and the disputed territory of Kosovo had already adopted the Deutsche Mark and later the euro when the mark was replaced by it in 2002. The Serbs in North Kosovo and the enclaves within it continue to use the dinar. However, in February 2024, the Kosovan government banned the use of the dinar for payment, making the euro the sole legal tender nationwide. The Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, later clarified that the currency was not banned but that the euro would be the only legal currency for commercial transactions and that there would be a months-long transition period to ease in the new legislation.

Between 2003 and 2006, the Serbian dinar used the ISO 4217 code &quot;CSD&quot;, with CS being the ISO 3166-1 country code for Serbia and Montenegro. When the State Union was dissolved in 2006, the dinar&#x27;s ISO 4217 code was changed to the current &quot;RSD&quot;.

====Coins====
Coins currently in circulation are , , , , and coins. All coins feature identical inscriptions in Serbian, using the Cyrillic and Latin scripts. The and coins are uncommon in circulation, as banknotes of the same value are used instead.
===Banknotes===
In 2003, banknotes of the (re-established) National Bank of Serbia were introduced in denominations of , , and . followed these in 2004, in 2005, , and in 2006, in 2011.

<doc id="520084" wikidata="Q1141963" url="?curid=520084" title="Star Fox 64">
<text>known as Lylat Wars in the PAL regions, is a 1997 rail shooter game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It is the second installment in the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series and a reboot of the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; was the first Nintendo 64 game to feature support for the system&#x27;s Rumble Pak peripheral, which initially came bundled with retail copies of the game. Since its release in 1997, the game has sold over 4 million copies, making it the best-selling game in the series and the ninth best-selling game on the system. The game received critical acclaim for its precise controls, voice acting, multiplayer modes, and replay value through the use of branching gameplay paths. Like the SNES &quot;Star Fox&quot; game before it, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; has been deemed one of the greatest video games of all time. A stereoscopic 3D remake for the Nintendo 3DS, &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;, was released in 2011, and a reimagining for the Wii U, &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, was released in 2016. The game was also re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack at the launch of the service on October 25, 2021.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; is a 3D rail shooter game in which the player controls one of the vehicles piloted by Fox McCloud, usually an Arwing. Most of the game takes place in &quot;Corridor Mode&quot;, which forces Fox&#x27;s vehicle down an on-rails path straight forward through the environment. In Corridor Mode, the player&#x27;s vehicle can be maneuvered around the screen to dodge obstacles and can also perform a somersault to get behind enemies or dodge projectiles. The Arwing is also capable of deflecting enemy fire while performing a spinning maneuver called a &quot;barrel roll&quot; (actually an aileron roll in real-life aviation terms). The Arwing and Landmaster can charge up their laser cannons to unleash a powerful lock-on laser.

In addition to Corridor Mode, some stages of the game, including multiplayer and most boss fights, take place in &quot;All-Range Mode&quot;. In this variant, the player can move freely in a three-dimensional space within the confines of a large arena. The Arwing can also perform one new maneuver in All-Range Mode: a U-Turn to change direction.

Throughout the game, the player can fly or drive through power-ups to collect them. These include silver and gold rings that refill the vehicle&#x27;s shields, weapon upgrades, wing repairs, extra lives, and Nova bombs.

Returning from the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; are wingmen that fly with the player in their own Arwings. Fox&#x27;s wingmen periodically attack enemies or are pursued into the player&#x27;s field of view, requiring the player to shoot down the pursuers before the wingman has to retreat to the &quot;Great Fox&quot; mothership for repairs (the character will then be unavailable to start the next stage, but may return if enough time passes). Each wingman provides a different form of assistance to the player: Slippy Toad scans bosses and displays their shields on the player&#x27;s screen, Peppy Hare provides gameplay advice, and Falco Lombardi occasionally locates alternate routes through stages. Some stages also feature special appearances from supporting characters Katt Monroe or Bill Grey, who assist the team.

The game features a branching level system, in which more difficult paths are unlocked by completing certain objectives. Players can also change paths once the current mission is accomplished. All of the game&#x27;s possible routes start at Corneria, eventually putting the player in contact with the Star Wolf Team, and end at Venom in a confrontation with Andross.

To add replay challenge, the game also features awardable medals, which are earned by accomplishing a mission with all wingmen intact and having achieved a certain hit total. Obtaining medals unlocks bonus features, such as new multiplayer vehicles, cosmetic changes to Fox in single player, and additional game settings such as &quot;Expert Mode&quot;.

===Vehicles===

The Arwing is the primary fighter craft used by the Star Fox team. The player can use the fighter&#x27;s boost meter to perform special techniques to avoid collisions, change direction, and gain tactical advantages in combat. Certain levels also put the player in a tank-like vehicle called the Landmaster, as well as a submarine named the Blue Marine on the planet Aquas. Each vehicle shares some tactical characteristics with the Arwing while providing its own unique gameplay elements.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; features split-screen multiplayer support for up to four players simultaneously. At first, users can only play using the Arwing fighter, but by earning certain medals in the main campaign, players can unlock the Landmaster tank and fight on foot as one of the four members of Star Fox equipped with a bazooka. Multiplayer is the only place where players can use a Landmaster with upgraded lasers.

There are three modes of multiplayer play: a &quot;point match&quot; in which the player must shoot down an opponent a certain number of times, a &quot;battle royal&quot; in which the last player left wins, and a &quot;time trial&quot; to destroy enemy fighters.

== Plot ==
===Characters===
The Star Fox team is a group of mercenaries who are enlisted by General Pepper to defend the Lylat system. The team consists of:
* Fox McCloud: A red fox who took over leadership of the team after his father, James, was captured by Andross in a prior assault. Fox is the game&#x27;s protagonist and only playable character in Story Mode.
* Peppy Hare: A rabbit who was part of the original Star Fox team. He survived and escaped when Pigma betrayed the team, which led to James&#x27;s capture. He serves on the current Star Fox team as a mentor to Fox during missions.
* Falco Lombardi: A falcon who is an excellent fighter, but is also quite cocky and self-assured. He looks for alternate routes and shortcuts.
* Slippy Toad: A frog who is the team&#x27;s mechanical expert. He is cheerful and energetic, but also prone to getting himself in trouble. He provides the player with valuable information about certain enemies and bosses.

Star Fox receives instructions and support from General Pepper, a bloodhound and leader of the Cornerian militia. The team&#x27;s mothership, the &quot;Great Fox&quot;, is piloted by a robot named ROB 64 (NUS64 in the Japanese version). Two other supporting characters appear in certain missions to provide aid to the Star Fox team: Bill Grey, Fox&#x27;s bulldog friend and leader of two fighter units; and Katt Monroe, Falco&#x27;s friend and former gang member.

Andross is the game&#x27;s primary antagonist who resembles a monkey or ape. He is a evil mad scientist who is intent on capturing and controlling the Lylat system. To stop Star Fox&#x27;s progress, Andross recruits the Star Wolf team, a rival band of mercenaries consisting of the team leader Wolf O&#x27;Donnell, a wolf and Fox&#x27;s long-time rival; Leon Powalski, a sinister chameleon who targets Falco; Andrew Oikonny, Andross&#x27;s nephew, who goes after Slippy; and Pigma Dengar, a pig and traitor to the original Star Fox team who chases his former teammate Peppy.

===Story===
On Corneria, the fourth planet of the Lylat system, the scientist Andross is driven to madness and nearly destroys the planet using biological weapons. General Pepper exiles Andross to the remote planet Venom. Five years later, Pepper detects suspicious activity on Venom. Pepper hires the Star Fox team (including James McCloud, Peppy Hare, and Pigma Dengar) to investigate. After Pigma betrays the team, Andross captures James and kills him; Peppy escapes from Venom alive and informs James&#x27;s son Fox about his father&#x27;s fate.

A few years later, Andross launches an attack across the Lylat system. Defending Corneria, Pepper summons the new Star Fox team, now consisting of new team leader Fox, Peppy, Falco Lombardi, and Slippy Toad. While traveling through several planets, the team battles with several of Andross&#x27; henchmen, including the rival mercenary team Star Wolf. After the team arrives at Venom, Fox confronts Andross alone, with the encounter taking two different forms depending on how the player approaches the planet. If the player arrives from Bolse, Fox destroys a robotic version of Andross, leaving Andross himself adrift in the Lylat system. If the player arrives from Area 6, Fox reveals Andross&#x27; true form as that of a floating brain, and finally kills him. Shortly before his death, Andross activates his base&#x27;s self-destruct system in a last-ditch attempt to kill Fox. However, James appears and guides Fox out of the exploding base before disappearing again.

After defeating Andross in either encounter, Fox returns with his team to Corneria for a victory celebration. Pepper offers the team the opportunity to join the Cornerian Army, but Fox declines and the team departs. Following the game&#x27;s credits sequence, the player&#x27;s final score is presented as a bill Pepper receives from Star Fox for their services.

==Development==

Following the release of &quot;Star Fox&quot; in 1993, series creator Shigeru Miyamoto began working on &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). By 1995, Miyamoto and team had largely finished development of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; before realizing that its release would require the upgraded Super FX 2 chip, which would increase the cost of the game. Furthermore, newly launched competitor consoles, namely the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation, possessed processing power and graphics capabilities that dwarfed those of the SNES, making &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; appear obsolete. Recognizing this and that the Nintendo 64 would launch the following year with significantly increased processing power and graphical capabilities, Miyamoto made the decision to cancel &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, though the game would eventually see an official release on the Super NES Classic Edition and the Nintendo Switch Online service.

Around this time, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;&#x27;s development reportedly began with a series of experiments by character designer Takaya Imamura and programmer Kazuaki Morita. As Morita was new to 3D programming, creating something entirely new was difficult, and to make matters worse, they didn&#x27;t have the final N64 hardware itself to work with, instead having to utilize a bulky development computer and a modified Super Nintendo controller without analog sticks, as those were being used by the development team for &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, which were given higher priority. The pair decided to begin development by porting the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;, which they thought would be better for easing into 3D. As this was Morita&#x27;s first attempt at learning 3D, he began with inputting his own data and placing objects like cubes on a course, and then launched basic-looking Arwings; this prototype was affectionately named &quot;Star Box&quot;. Imamura and Morita continued their experiments for six months, becoming attached to it and wanting to realize it as a commercial product, while the higher-ups at Nintendo were reportedly not enthusiastic about the project and were even waiting for the two to give up on it. All this would change, however, when the game that would form into &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; was first shown off at Shoshinkai 1995, where they had displayed ten seconds of promotional footage, and from there the game&#x27;s production would be properly green-lit, with director Takao Shimizu coming on board. 

While Imamura was credited solely as &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;&#x27;s art director, he would actually be responsible for many other aspects of the game, from planning, to writing the overall plot, instructing the composers on what kind of music he wanted for it, and coming up with the gameplay mechanics and graphics, later describing it as &quot;the game of his life&quot;. Miyamoto had two overall goals and themes for &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;: The first was to create a more fleshed out &quot;Star Fox&quot; game, as they weren&#x27;t able to achieve a high enough processing speed for the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; because of hardware limitations. The other goal was also to retain some of the best elements from the then-cancelled &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, not wanting all of that development teams&#x27; efforts to go to waste. As such, the development team, which was composed primarily of different staff members from those who worked on &quot;Star Fox&quot; and &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, barring certain alumni such as Miyamoto and Imamura, cribbed heavily from the work that had been done in those two games, stating in an interview that roughly 30% of &quot;64&quot;″s gameplay came from the original game, roughly 60% came from the cancelled sequel, and the remaining 10% was original work done during development. In particular, Miyamoto said: &quot;All-Range Mode, Multi-Player Mode and the Star Wolf scenario all came from &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;&quot;. In regards to the All-Range mode, Morita reportedly worked on this aspect in secret initially as an experiment, inspired by what he saw from &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;. The game&#x27;s branching pathways were meant to act as a middle ground between the original &quot;Star Fox&quot;&#x27;s static difficulty routes and also &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;&#x27;s more free-form gameplay. At some point in development, it was decided to include extra NPC characters such as Bill and Katt as a way to enhance the experience based on player interactions, to make their choices in the branching paths feel like they mattered.

One new aspect of gameplay was the addition of levels that used the Landmaster tank and the Blue-Marine submarine, which were conceived of by members of the development team (rather than Miyamoto himself) in response to Miyamoto&#x27;s suggestion that the game include a &quot;human-type craft&quot;, which the team generally did not approve of. The team originally intended for the game to contain multiple underwater levels but ultimately scaled back as they found that the underwater levels slowed down the pacing of the game. The team also wanted to include another variation of the Venom stage, where Fox would step out of the Arwing and battle Andross on-foot with a bazooka, but this was discarded for time, and its remnants were repurposed for the game&#x27;s battle mode. 

With the underlying gameplay largely complete early in development, Miyamoto and the team focused the majority of their efforts on graphics, audio and dialogue, and enemy AI, seeking to harness the Nintendo 64&#x27;s processing power. For example, inspired by Miyamoto being a fan of the British puppet-based show &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the development team animated the game&#x27;s characters opening and closing their mouths in a puppet-like fashion while speaking, which reduced the overall amount of animation work required for the game. The team also realized that adding dynamic audio would enhance the 3D gameplay experience as the player&#x27;s allies could audibly signal when the player was being pursued by an offscreen enemy. In writing dialogue for the game&#x27;s characters, the developers sought to invoke traditional historical dramas, adding more conventional lines such as &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for you, Star Fox&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re becoming more like your father&quot;. Edgier dialogue such as &quot;I guess it&#x27;s your turn to be thankful&quot; was written for the character Falco Lombardi, while more supportive dialogue such as &quot;Never give up. Trust your instincts!&quot; came from the character Peppy Hare. Originally, the development team themselves actually tried to provide the voice lines for the characters, with Imamura in particular providing the voice for Fox and programmer Nobuhiro Sumiyoshi providing the voice for Leon; this was met with negative reception internally and thus it was decided to switch over to using professional voice actors. This developer&#x27;s dub would eventually be uncovered several years later via the Nintendo data leak of 2020. 
&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; was also the first title to make use of the Rumble Pak peripheral, which came bundled with the game in some instances. Miyamoto stated that the development team struggled to utilize the Rumble Pak in a way that players understood, noting that during development, players were often confused as to why their controller was vibrating.

==Release==
The game was first shown publicly at E3 1996 where Nintendo released a video of an early version of the game. This early version of the game showcased only the first level (Corneria) and featured a minimalistic HUD, showing only a crude meter reflecting the player&#x27;s shield gauge. Nintendo released further beta footage of the game on December 6, 1996, that showed subsequent levels, an improved HUD, and a short multiplayer segment.

As the game approached launch, Nintendo became concerned that the title &quot;Star Fox&quot; could be considered too similar to the name of the German company &quot;StarVox&quot;. Thus like its predecessor, the game was rebranded as &quot;Lylat Wars&quot; in certain PAL territories. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; subscribers received a promotional video prior to &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;″s release (the same tactic was used to promote &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; for the SNES as well as &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, &quot;Banjo-Kazooie&quot;, and &quot;Hey You, Pikachu!&quot; for the Nintendo 64) that advertised the game&#x27;s cinematic presentation, as well as new features like the Rumble Pak and voice acting. It revolves around two agents of Sega and Sony (who at the time were Nintendo&#x27;s biggest hardware competitors) interrogating a Nintendo employee into revealing information about the game. The game reportedly had a marketing budget of $7 million.

Years after release, a substantial number of unused assets were found on the cartridge including unused icons, audio files, levels, and power-ups. In an interview post-release, Miyamoto said that while he was not 100% satisfied with the final version of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, he felt that the game made better use of the Nintendo 64&#x27;s increased processing power than &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, which was a launch title for the console and which Miyamoto had also developed.

An unofficial PC port of the game named &quot;StarShip&quot;, developed by the team behind the &quot;Ship of Harkinian&quot; port of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, was later released in December 2024.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; received critical acclaim and was one of the top-selling games of 1997, second to &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;. Reviews hailed the level branching system, particularly its use of player performance and secret in-level triggers rather than simple path selection. Many reviewers also praised the multiplayer modes as an ample source of replay value. However, Crispin Boyer of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) considered them a waste, contending that the split screen display made targets too small to pinpoint. The game&#x27;s voice clips were widely complimented, not for the quality of the acting, but for the unprecedented quantity of audio clips for a cartridge-based game. Critics also applauded the precise analog control, boss designs, Rumble Pak implementation, and cinematic cutscenes. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave the game a perfect 5 out of 5 in all four categories, praising the gameplay, graphics, controls, and fun factor.

The most common criticism was that &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; was not as much of a leap over the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was over previous &quot;Mario&quot; games, in particular that the gameplay was still on rails. This perceived shortcoming did little to dull critics&#x27; response to the game, however. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Glenn Rubenstein declared &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; &quot;an instant classic&quot; and &quot;a pleasure to look at&quot;. &quot;EGM&quot; gave it their &quot;Game of the Month&quot; award, with Dan Hsu calling it &quot;a shooting fan&#x27;s dream come true&quot; and Shawn Smith &quot;almost as good as &quot;Mario 64&quot;&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; reviewer Doug Perry said it &quot;demonstrates that shooters are more alive now than ever&quot;.

The &quot;GameSpot&quot; review of the Wii Virtual Console version bestows a (7.6/10), praising its simple, enjoyable shooting gameplay, and much voice acting. The review says the game is nice to look at regardless of its graphic age, with added replay value in finding hidden paths, but found the lack of rumble support &quot;alarming&quot;, especially since it is the first game to support the Rumble Pak.

In the first five days of the game&#x27;s U.S. launch, more than 300,000 copies were sold, surpassing the record previously held by &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; and &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. It sold above 1 million units in the United States by the end of 1997, one of five Nintendo 64 games to do so. Sales were considerably less in Japan, where it sold 75,595 copies during the first week of sale. The game also took the #73 spot in &quot;Nintendo Power&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever&quot;.

&quot;Star Fox 64&quot; is listed as the 45th greatest game of all time by &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; in 2009. In 1997 &quot;EGM&quot; ranked it the 39th best console video game of all time, citing its amazing visuals, huge amount of voice acting, and the deep challenge of earning medals on all stages and completing expert mode. They also named it &quot;Shooter of the Year&quot; at their 1997 Editors&#x27; Choice Awards. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 14th in a list of the greatest Nintendo games. In 2012, G4 ranked &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; as the 74th greatest game of all time on their list of the top 100 greatest video games of all time.

==Remake==

At E3 2010, Nintendo announced a remake of &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, titled &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot;. Nintendo exhibited a demo the same day that emphasized the technology of the Nintendo 3DS. The remake was co-developed by Q-Games and features stereoscopic 3D graphics, quality-of-life improvements, gyroscope controls, and brand new voice recordings. The game was released on July 14 in Japan and September 9, 2011 in Europe and North America. This marked the first time that &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; had been released in PAL territories under the original &quot;Star Fox&quot; name. While the remake supports multiplayer for up to four players via download play, the game does not have an online multiplayer mode.

<doc id="520089" wikidata="Q945002" url="?curid=520089" title="Wicklow Mountains">
<text>The Wicklow Mountains (, archaic: &quot;Cualu&quot;) form the largest continuous upland area in Ireland. They occupy the whole centre of County Wicklow and stretch outside its borders into the counties of Dublin, Wexford and Carlow. Where the mountains extend into County Dublin, they are known locally as the Dublin Mountains (&quot;Sléibhte Bhaile Átha Cliath&quot;). The highest peak is Lugnaquilla at .

The mountains are primarily composed of granite surrounded by an envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. They were pushed up during the Caledonian orogeny at the start of the Devonian period and form part of the Leinster Chain, the largest continuous area of granite in Ireland and Britain. The mountains owe much of their present topography to the effects of the last ice age, which deepened the glens and created corrie and ribbon lakes. Copper and lead have been the main metals mined in the mountains and a brief gold rush occurred in the 18th century.
Several major river systems have their source in the mountains, such as the Liffey, Dargle, Slaney and Avoca rivers. Powerscourt Waterfall is the second tallest in Ireland at . A number of these rivers have been harnessed to create reservoirs for drinking water for Dublin and its surroundings.

The Wicklow Mountains experience a temperate oceanic climate with mild, damp summers and cool, wet winters. The dominant habitat of the uplands consists of blanket bog, heath and upland grassland. The uplands support a number of bird species, including merlin and peregrine falcon. The valleys are a mixture of coniferous and deciduous woodland.

The mountains have been inhabited since Neolithic times and a number of typical monuments, in particular a series of passage tombs, survive to the present day. The monastery at Glendalough, founded in the late 6th century by Saint Kevin, was an important centre of the Early Church in Ireland. Following the Norman invasion in the 12th century, the Wicklow Mountains became a stronghold and hiding place for Irish clans opposed to English rule. The O&#x27;Byrne and O&#x27;Toole families carried out a campaign of harassment against the settlers for almost five centuries. Later the mountains harboured rebels during the 1798 Rising. Rebel activity died out after the construction of the Wicklow Military Road at the start of the 19th century and the mountains began to attract tourists to the ruins at Glendalough and to admire the mountain scenery.

The Wicklow Mountains continue to be a major attraction for tourism and recreation. The entire upland area is designated as a Special Area of Conservation and as a Special Protection Area under European Union law. The Wicklow Mountains National Park was established in 1991 to conserve the local biodiversity and landscape.

==Name==
The Wicklow Mountains take their name from County Wicklow which in turn takes its name from Wicklow town. The origin of the name is from the Old Norse &quot;Wykynglo&quot; or &quot;Wykinlo&quot;. The Irish name for Wicklow, &quot;&quot;, means &quot;Church of Mantan&quot;, named after an apostle of Saint Patrick. Wicklow was not established as a county until 1606; before that it had been part of County Dublin. During the medieval period, prior to the establishment of County Wicklow, the English administration in Dublin referred to the region as the Leinster Mountains.

An early name for the whole area of the Wicklow Mountains was &quot;Cualu&quot;, later &quot;Cuala&quot;. The Irish name for Great Sugar Loaf mountain is &quot;Ó Cualann&quot; (&quot;lump of Cuala&quot;). There are also historic names for various territories in the mountains held by local clans: the north part of Wicklow and south Dublin was known as &quot;Cualann&quot; or &quot;Fir Chualann&quot; (&quot;men of Cuala&quot;), anglicised &#x27;Fercullen&#x27;, while the Glen of Imaal takes its name from the territory of &quot;Uí Máil&quot;. A sept of the O&#x27;Byrne family called the Gaval Rannall possessed the area around Glenmalure, known as &quot;Gaval-Rannall&quot; or &quot;Ranelagh&quot;.

The mountains were also formerly known as &quot;Sliabh Ruadh&quot; or the Red Mountains.

==Topography==
The Wicklow Mountains are the largest area of continuous high ground in Ireland, having an unbroken area of over above . They occupy the centre of County Wicklow and extend into Counties Dublin, Carlow and Wexford. The general direction of the mountain ranges is from north-east to south-west. They are formed into several distinct groups: that of Kippure in the north, on the boundary of Dublin and Wicklow; Djouce, Tonelagee, Camaderry and Lugnaquilla in the centre; Church Mountain and Keadeen Mountain in the west; and Croghan Kinsella to the south. To the east, separated from the rest of the range by the Vartry Plateau, is the group comprising the Great Sugar Loaf, Little Sugar Loaf and Bray Head.

Lugnaquilla is the highest peak in the Wicklow Mountains at and the 13th highest in Ireland. It is also the highest peak in Leinster and is the only Irish Munro to be found outside of Munster. Kippure stands at . There are a total of 39 peaks over in the Wicklow Mountains. There are only three passes through the mountains under with the Sally Gap () and the Wicklow Gap () being the highest road passes in the country.

==Geology==
The Wicklow Mountains are primarily composed of granite surrounded by an envelope of mica-schist and much older rocks such as quartzite. The oldest rocks are the quartzites of the Bray Group that include Bray Head and the Little Sugar Loaf and Great Sugar Loaf mountains. These metamorphosed from sandstone deposited in the deep waters of the primeval Iapetus Ocean during the Cambrian period (542–488 million years ago). Layers of sediment continued to form slates and shales along the ocean floor mixed with volcanic rock pushed up as Iapetus began to shrink by the process of subduction during the Ordovician period (488–443 million years ago). These rocks now underlie the uplifted peneplain of the Vartry Plateau between the Bray Group and the main range.

The Iapetus Ocean closed up completely at the end of the Silurian period (443–415 million years ago) and the Wicklow Mountains were uplifted during the main phase of the Caledonian orogeny at the start of the Devonian period (415–358 million years ago) when the continents of Baltica and Laurentia collided. The collision pushed up a large batholith of granite, known as the Leinster Chain: this is the largest continuous area of granite in Ireland and Britain and runs from the coast at Dún Laoghaire in County Dublin to New Ross in County Wexford and includes the Wicklow and Blackstairs Mountains. The heat generated by the collision metamorphosed the slates and shales surrounding the granite into schists which formed an aureole (shell) around the granite. The process of erosion has removed much of the surrounding schist from the mountain tops, exposing the underlying granite. Some remnants of the schist roof remain on some of the mountain tops, most notably Lugnaquilla. The round granite-topped peaks contrast with the sharper schist peaks: for example, War Hill (granite) and Djouce (schist).
The last major geological event to shape the Wicklow Mountains was the Quaternary glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago). The ice deepened and moulded the valleys into the U-shape that characterises the Wicklow Glens, such as Glendalough and Glenmacnass. As the ice melted, small glaciers were left in corries where moraines now dam lakes such as at Loughs Bray and Nahanagan. Corries without lakes also occur, such as the North Prison and South Prison of Lugnaquilla. Escaping meltwater cut narrow rocky gorges at several locations including the Glen of the Downs, the Devil&#x27;s Glen and The Scalp. Ribbon lakes, such as Lough Dan and the lakes of Glendalough, also formed.

===Mining and quarrying===
The zone of collision between the continental plates that led to the formation of the Wicklow Mountains also led to mineralisation and the formation of Ireland&#x27;s most significant metalliferous belt. The most important mining sites have been at Avoca and Glendalough. Mining has taken place at Avoca since at least the Bronze Age (–600 BCE). Iron ore extraction took place between the 12th and 17th centuries before being replaced by lead mining up to the mid-18th century. The principal activity from 1720 to the closure of the last mine in 1982 was copper extraction. Sulphur has also been extracted at certain times and, in smaller quantities, gold, silver and zinc. Lead mining has been the principal activity in the Glendalough valley and its neighbouring valleys of Glendasan and Glenmalure. Lead was first discovered in Glendasan in the early 19th century and the lead veins were later followed through Camaderry mountain to Glendalough. Mining on a smaller scale took place in Glenmalure. Ore from these mines was shipped to Ballycorus for processing. The last mine closed in 1957.
In 1795, workers felling timber discovered gold near the Aughatinavought River, a tributary of the River Aughrim (since renamed the Goldmines River), that rises on the slopes of Croghan Kinsella mountain. During the subsequent gold rush in Wicklow, some of gold was recovered from the river by local prospectors, including a single nugget weighing , the largest lump of gold ever discovered in Ireland and Britain. The mine workings were subsequently seized by the British government who extracted a further of gold. Various attempts have been made to locate the motherlode on Croghan Kinsella but to no avail.

Granite from the Wicklow Mountains has been used as a material for many buildings in Wicklow, Dublin city and beyond. According to Wyse Jackson and Caulfield, granite was reportedly first quarried in west Wicklow in the early 1700s &quot;from several openings at Baltyboys near Blessington, and from 1740 in more significant volumes at Woodend and Threecastles nearby and then from Golden Hill quarry&quot; near the village of Manor Kilbride. In 1720, Trinity College Dublin accounts show that one John Bawnan was paid £11-10s-7d for &quot;Blessington Stones delivered for work on the new kitchen&quot; there. 

From 1824, the quarries at Ballyknockan provided material for buildings such as the Bank of Ireland on College Green in Dublin, Dún Laoghaire lighthouse and Liverpool Cathedral until they closed in the late 20th century. Similarly, quarries at Glencullen and Barnacullia in the &quot;Dublin Mountains&quot; provided stone for such buildings as the G. P. O. on O&#x27;Connell Street and the Industry and Commerce building on Kildare Street in Dublin. Barnacullia, on the slopes of Three Rock Mountain, supplied paving stones to Dublin Corporation, and the quarry at Dalkey supplied granite for Dún Laoghaire Harbour and the Thames Embankment in London.

==Hydrology==
The Wicklow Mountains are the source of several major river systems. Since the thin blanket bog peats cannot hold great quantities of water, many of these rivers exhibit a flashy hydrography, filling rapidly after heavy rain.

The River Liffey rises between the mountains of Kippure and Tonduff at Liffey Head Bog. One of the major tributaries of the Liffey, the River Dodder, rises nearby on slopes on Kippure. The King&#x27;s River rises on Mullaghcleevaun and joins the Liffey near Blessington.

The River Vartry rises on the slopes of Djouce mountain. Nearby, the River Dargle rises between Tonduff and War Hill, falling as the Powerscourt Waterfall, Ireland&#x27;s second tallest waterfall at , over a cliff formed by a glacier at the contact point between the granite and mica-schist of the Wicklow Mountains. The waterfalls at the heads of the valleys of Glendalough, Glenmacnass and Glendasan also occur approximately at the schist-granite junctions, as does the Carrawaystick waterfall in Glenmalure.

The River Slaney rises in the North Prison of Lugnaquilla mountain and winds through the Glen of Imaal where it is joined by the Leoh, Knickeen and Little Slaney. Another of its tributaries, the River Derreen, rises on Lugnaquilla&#x27;s southern side.

Each of the main branches of the River Avoca—the Avonmore, the Avonbeg and the Aughrim rivers—have their origins in smaller tributaries, many of which rise in the Wicklow Mountains. The Glenealo, Glendasan and Annamoe rivers meet to form the Avonmore near Laragh. The Annamoe rises near Sally Gap and is joined by Cloghoge Brook between Lough Tay and Lough Dan and by the River Inchavore in Lough Dan. The Avonbeg rises on Table Mountain and the Three Lakes. The Avonmore and Avonbeg rivers join to form the River Avoca at the Meeting of the Waters in the Vale of Avoca, celebrated in the song &quot;The Meeting of the Waters&quot; by Thomas Moore. The Avoca is joined by the River Aughrim at Woodenbridge, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Second Meeting of the Waters&quot;. The Aughrim is formed at the junction of the Derry Water and the River Ow, the latter of which rises on Lugnaquilla.
===Reservoirs===

Several of these rivers have been dammed to create reservoirs to provide drinking water for the residents of Dublin and its environs. The first of these was the River Vartry, dammed to create the Vartry Reservoir near Roundwood in the 1860s. A second dam was added in 1924 to increase capacity. The River Dodder feeds the two Bohernabreena reservoirs in the northern foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at Glenasmole in County Dublin, which were constructed between 1883 and 1887 to supply water to the townland of Rathmines. The Poulaphouca Reservoir, on the River Liffey near Blessington, was constructed between 1938 and 1940. There are also two hydroelectricity plants at Poulaphouca, constructed during the 1940s. A pumped-storage hydroelectricity plant was constructed at Turlough Hill between 1968 and 1974. Water is pumped up from Lough Nanahangan, a natural corrie lake, into an artificial reservoir on Tomaneena mountain and released at times of peak electricity demand.

==Climate==

In common with the rest of Ireland, the Wicklow Mountains experience a temperate oceanic climate with mild, damp summers and cool, wet winters. Annual rainfall reaches on the highest mountains with the more westerly peaks getting the most rainfall (for example, Djouce mountain, in the east, receives approximately , whereas Duff Hill, in the west, receives approximately a year). June and July are generally the driest months and there is an average of four hours of sunshine a day over the entire year. Snow cover in winter can reach an average of 50 days a year on the highest peaks. Strong winds are an important factor in peat erosion on the summits.

==Habitat==
The primary habitat of the uplands consists of heath and bog. The mountain blanket bogs formed around 4,000 years ago as a result of a combination of climate change and human activity. Prior to this, the mountains were cloaked with pine forest. A change in the climate to wetter and milder weather left the ground waterlogged and leached nutrients from the soil, leading to the formation of peat. Mountain blanket bog is found in areas above in altitude and where there are more than 175 days rainfall a year. The most important builders of peat are the &quot;Sphagnum&quot; bog mosses. Carnivorous plants such as sundews and butterworts are specific to boglands and bog asphodel and bog cotton are also common. Bog water is important for the reproduction of dragonflies and damselflies and the Wicklow mountain bogs also support insects such as pond skaters, whirligig beetles, water boatmen and midges as well as the common frog and the viviparous lizard. Wading birds such as snipes, curlews and golden plover feed in the waterlogged bogland.

Due to drainage of water from the bogs as a result of human activity, most of Wicklow&#x27;s peat has dried out too much for &quot;Sphagnum&quot; mosses to grow and moorland and heath vegetation has taken over. Active peat building is still occurring at some sites, most notably the Liffey Head Bog. Common heather (or ling) and bell heather are the most common moorland plants along with bilberry (or fraughan, as it is known in Ireland), bog cotton, deergrass and purple moor grass. Bird species found on the Wicklow moorland include red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. Birds of prey found in the uplands include kestrels, hen harriers, merlins and peregrine falcons. The latter of these are protected species. The uplands are used for sheep grazing and so the moorland is periodically burned to keep the growth of heather in check and encourage growth of grasses.
Red deer, once native to Wicklow but hunted to extinction, were reintroduced on the Powerscourt Estate in the 18th century. Japanese sika deer were also imported by the Powerscourt Estate and have interbred with the red deer. All deer found in the Wicklow Mountains are descended from the Powerscourt herd and are either sika deer or hybrid red-sika deer. Other mammals occurring include feral goats, mountain hares, badgers, stoats, otters, red squirrels, grey squirrels and bats. The Irish elk is an extinct species of deer that lived in the Wicklow Mountains c. 11,000 years ago, remains of which were discovered in great quantities in Ballybetagh Bog near Glencullen. Wolves were also once native to the mountains but were hunted to extinction in Ireland: the last wolf in Wicklow was killed at Glendalough in 1710.
Widespread clearance of forest began in the Bronze Age and continued up until the early 20th century. Afforestation programmes began in the 1920s and accelerated in the 1950s with the widespread planting of conifer forest, especially in upland moorland areas previously considered unsuitable for planting. The dominant tree is the sitka spruce, accounting for 58% of forest plantations, with lodgepole pine, Norway spruce, Scots pine, larch and Douglas fir also planted. Biodiversity is low in the conifer plantations because they are not native tree species. Broadleaf plantations are rare, accounting for less than 10% of forest.

The young rivers in the upper glens are spawning grounds for salmon and brown trout. Arctic char, isolated in the Wicklow lakes following the end of the last ice age, have been recorded in Lough Dan and the lakes of Glendalough but are now believed extinct. A programme to reintroduce them into the Upper Lake at Glendalough commenced in 2009.

==History==
The earliest evidence of human activity in the interior of Wicklow dates to around 4,300 BCE. Passage tombs, from the Neolithic period, are the earliest and most prominent feature of prehistoric Irish civilisation in the Wicklow Mountains. These tombs sit on many of the western and northern summits between Saggart in Dublin and Baltinglass in Wicklow, such as at Seefin and Seefingan. Archaeologist Geraldine Stout has suggested they had a territorial marking function, much like modern-day border posts. Other prehistoric monuments to be found in the uplands include stone circles, standing stones and rock art. The presence of standing stones at altitudes suggests they may have served route-marking purposes. The largest complex of hill forts in Ireland is to be found on the hills near Baltinglass.

The earliest known tribes to have controlled the Wicklow Mountains include the Dál Messin Corb, the Uí Mail, the Uí Theig and the Uí Briúin. One member of the Dál Messin Corb was Saint Kevin, who founded the monastery at Glendalough in the latter part of the 6th century. Kevin travelled to Glendalough from Hollywood, crossing the mountains via the Wicklow Gap. By the 8th century, Glendalough had grown into a substantial settlement of 500–1,000 people and an important site of learning and pilgrimage. Monasteries were often attacked, especially at times of disease or famine, and Glendalough&#x27;s wealth made it a frequent target for both local tribes and, later, Norse invaders. The monastery declined in importance after the arrival of the Normans in the 12th century and its subsequent annexation to the Archdiocese of Dublin. It was burned by the English in 1398, although settlement there continued until the end of the 16th century. There are also important early Irish church sites in the Dublin foothills of the Wicklow Mountains at Rathmichael and Tully.

In 1170, during the Norman invasion of Ireland, Strongbow and Dermot MacMurrough successfully laid siege to Dublin by following a high route through the Wicklow Mountains, avoiding the defences along the normal route to the west of the mountains. The Norman invasion displaced two important Gaelic clans from Kildare, the O&#x27;Byrnes and the O&#x27;Tooles, who moved into the Wicklow Mountains, the O&#x27;Byrnes in the east and the O&#x27;Tooles in the west. From their mountain strongholds both families conducted a persistent campaign of harassment against the invaders and the Wicklow Mountains became known as the &quot;terra guerre&quot; (&quot;land of war&quot;), as opposed to the &quot;terra pacis&quot; (&quot;land of peace&quot;) of the settled lowlands.

The valley of Glenmalure provided an almost unassailable refuge for the clans and English forces suffered heavy defeats there, first in 1274 and again in 1580 in the Battle of Glenmalure. The latter defeat was at the hands of Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne, who led many attacks against the English and assisted in the escapes of many of the hostages held by the English to guarantee the loyalty of the Irish clans. One such hostage was Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell, who escaped from Dublin Castle on the night of 6 January 1592 in the company of Art O&#x27;Neill. The two men crossed the mountains in blizzard conditions, making for Fiach McHugh O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s stronghold at Glenmalure. Art O&#x27;Neill died from exposure during the journey and Red Hugh had several toes amputated due to frostbite. A cross and a plaque to the north of Conavalla mountain mark the place where Art O&#x27;Neill perished and an annual walk named the Art O&#x27;Neill Challenge is now held following in the two men&#x27;s footsteps. The O&#x27;Byrnes&#x27; and O&#x27;Tooles&#x27; dominance finally came to an end with the Act of Succession of 1652 when their land was confiscated by the English Commonwealth.
A prolonged period of peace reigned in the Wicklow Mountains from the end of the Cromwellian period until the 1798 Rising. Although the main rebellion was quickly defeated, Irish rebels once again used the Wicklow Mountains as a hiding place and stronghold to attack the English for many years afterwards. Among their number was Michael Dwyer, a native of the Wicklow Mountains, born in the townland of Camara in the Glen of Imaal, and General Joseph Holt. Both men eventually surrendered and were transported to Australia. Determined to prevent any future rebel activity, a military road through the mountains, similar to those built in the Scottish Highlands to quell the Jacobite risings, was proposed by the British government to enable troops to be deployed quickly into the region. The Wicklow Military Road was constructed between 1800 and 1809 and runs from Rathfarnham, County Dublin to Aghavannagh, County Wicklow via Glencree, the Sally Gap and Laragh. A series of army barracks and police stations were built along the route, although they were little used and soon fell into disrepair as the Wicklow Mountains soon ceased to be a centre of rebel activity after the road was completed.

The census of 1841 recorded a population of 13,000 in the Wicklow uplands out of 126,143 persons in the county as a whole. Following the Great Famine, the census of 1891 showed that the population of County Wicklow had declined to 62,136 with the proportionate fall in the uplands regions even greater as the populace deserted the marginal lands.

The construction of the railways in the 19th century led to the development of tourism in the Wicklow Mountains. Visitors were taken by horse-drawn transport into the mountains from the railway station at Rathdrum. Glendalough quickly established itself as the most popular tourist destination and a train service there was considered in 1897 but the proposals came to nothing. The tourism potential of the Military Road was spotted soon after its completion and G. N. Wright&#x27;s &quot;Tours in Ireland&quot; (1822) is one of the earliest guides to the sights along the route.

==Present day==
The principal farming activity in the uplands is sheep grazing, using mainly the Wicklow Cheviot breed. Land is also used for forestry and turf cutting. Tourism and recreation are also major activities in the uplands. Glendalough remains the most popular destination, receiving around one million visitors each year. Recreational activities in the mountains include walking, rock climbing, winter climbing, fishing and cycling. Hillwalking in the Wicklow Mountains was first popularised by J. B. Malone through a weekly column he wrote in the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; newspaper. Malone was later instrumental in the creation of the Wicklow Way, Ireland&#x27;s first National Waymarked Trail, which opened in 1980 and crosses the Wicklow Mountains. The Wicklow Way has been joined by the Dublin Mountains Way and the Saint Kevin&#x27;s Way pilgrim path, both of which also traverse parts of the mountains.

On foot of concerns about environmental degradation and undesirable development of the Wicklow Uplands, the Government announced the creation of the Wicklow Mountains National Park in 1990 to conserve the area&#x27;s biodiversity and landscape. The park was officially established in 1991 and now encompasses an area of over . In addition, the Wicklow Mountains (including areas outside the National Park) are classed as a Special Area of Conservation under the EU Habitats Directive and as a Special Protection Area under the EU Birds Directive.

The Dublin foothills of the Wicklow Mountains are managed by the Dublin Mountains Partnership (DMP), a group established in May 2008 with the aim of improving the recreational experience of users of the Dublin Mountains. Its members include representatives of state agencies, local authorities and recreational users. The DMP has restored paths and developed walking trails, orienteering courses and a mountain biking course.

<text>Wolfgang Xavier Franz Ritter von Kobell (19 July 180311 November 1882) was a German mineralogist and writer of short stories and poems in Bavarian dialect.

==Biography==
Kobell was born in Munich, Bavaria (where he also died), son of the painter Wilhelm Kobell. After studying mineralogy in Landshut, he became professor of mineralogy in 1826 at the University of Munich, and in 1856 was appointed first curator of the Bavarian State collection of minerals. His greatest contributions were new methods in crystallography. In 1855 he invented the stauroscope for the study of the optical properties of crystals. The mineral kobellite is named after him, and he invented a comparative fusibility scale.

Besides his work as a mineralogist, Kobell is also famous for writing many short stories and poems in the Bavarian dialect of Upper Bavaria. He was among the regular hunting companions of the Bavarian dukes and monarchs. His best known work is a short story which was later used as base for the popular Bavarian stage play &quot;Der Brandner Kasper&quot;. The story is about a blacksmith from Tegernsee, who is visited by the grim reaper and tricks him into drinking and gambling for some further years on earth. The grim reaper has some issues with his management and convinces Kasper to stay in paradise, after he had a look into it, similar as in the Joshua ben Levi legend. The play was adapted 1974 for the stage by a grand nephew of Kobell, Kurt Wilhelm. There are different television and movie adaptations. Each year before All Saint&#x27;s Day it is being sent by the Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting Agency).

Kobell&#x27;s writing shows great comic awareness and the ability to combine a rich sense of fantasy with realism. 1834 Kobell went for a study journey to Greece during the short term kingdom of King Otto of Greece and was member of different academies. He pioneered as well early photographic and photochemistry procedures together with Carl August von Steinheil.

<text>Siteswap, also called quantum juggling or the Cambridge notation, is a numeric juggling notation used to describe or represent juggling patterns. The term may also be used to describe siteswap patterns, possible patterns transcribed using siteswap. Throws are represented by non-negative integers that specify the number of beats in the future when the object is thrown again: &quot;The idea behind siteswap is to keep track of the order that balls are thrown and caught, and only that.&quot; It is an invaluable tool in determining which combinations of throws yield valid juggling patterns for a given number of objects, and has led to previously unknown patterns (such as 441). However, it does not describe body movements such as behind-the-back and under-the-leg. Siteswap assumes that &quot;throws happen on beats that are equally spaced in time.&quot;

For example, a three-ball cascade may be notated &quot;3 &quot;, while a shower may be notated &quot;5 1&quot;.

==Origin==
The notation was invented by Paul Klimek in Santa Cruz, California in 1981, and later developed by undergraduates Bruce &quot;Boppo&quot; Tiemann, Joel David Hamkins, and the late Bengt Magnusson at the California Institute of Technology in 1985, and by Mike Day, mathematician Colin D Wright, and mathematician Adam Chalcraft in Cambridge, England in 1985 (whence comes an alternative name). Hamkins wrote computer code in 1985 to systematically generate siteswap patterns—the printouts were taken immediately to the Athenaeum lawn at Caltech to be tried out by himself, Tiemann, and Magnusson. The numbers derive from the number of balls used in the most common juggling patterns. Siteswap has been described as, &quot;perhaps the most popular&quot; name. 

The name &quot;siteswap&quot; comes from the ability to generate patterns by &quot;swapping&quot; landing times of any 2 &quot;sites&quot; in a siteswap using the . For example, swapping the landing times of throws &quot;5&quot; and &quot;1&quot; in the siteswap &quot;51&quot; generates the siteswap &quot;24&quot;.

==Vanilla==

Its simplest form, sometimes called vanilla siteswap, describes only patterns whose throws alternate hands and in which one ball is thrown from each hand at a time. If one were juggling while walking forward, something like the adjacent diagram would be seen from above, sometimes called a space-time diagram or ladder diagram. In this diagram, three balls are being juggled. Time progresses from the top to the bottom.

This pattern can be described by stating how many throws later each ball is caught. For instance, on the first throw in the diagram, the purple ball is thrown in the air (up out of the screen, towards the bottom left) by the right hand, next the blue ball, the green ball, the green ball again, and the blue ball again and then finally the purple ball is caught and thrown by the left hand on the fifth throw, this gives the first throw a count of &quot;5&quot;. This produces a sequence of numbers which denote the height of each throw to be made. Since hands alternate, odd-numbered throws send the ball to the other hand, while even-numbered throws send the ball to the same hand. A &quot;3&quot; represents a throw to the opposite hand at the height of the basic three-cascade; a &quot;4&quot; represents a throw to the same hand at the height of the four-fountain, and so on.

There are three special throws: a &quot;0&quot; is a pause with an empty hand, a &quot;1&quot; is a quick pass straight across to the other hand, and a &quot;2&quot; is a momentary hold of an object. Throws longer than &quot;9&quot; beats are given letters starting with &quot;a&quot;. The number of beats a ball is in the air usually corresponds to how high it was thrown, so many people refer to the numbers as heights, but this is not technically correct; all that matters is the number of beats in the air, not how high it is thrown. For example, bouncing a ball takes longer than a throw in the air to the same height, and so can be a higher siteswap value while being a lower throw.

Each pattern repeats after a certain number of throws, called the &quot;period&quot; of the pattern. The period is the number of digits in the shortest non-repeating representation of a pattern. For example, the pattern diagrammed on the right is 53145305520 which has 11 digits and therefore has a period of 11. If the period is an odd number, like this one, then each time the sequence is repeated, the sequence starts with the other hand, and the pattern is symmetrical because each hand is doing the same thing (although at different times). If the period is an even number then on every repeat of the pattern, each hand does the same thing it did last time and the pattern is asymmetrical.

The number of balls used for the pattern is the average of the throw numbers in the pattern. For example, &quot;441&quot; is a three-object pattern because (4+4+1)/3 is 3, and &quot;86&quot; is a seven-object pattern. All patterns must therefore have a siteswap sequence that averages to an integer. Not all such sequences describe patterns; for example &quot;543&quot; with integer average 4 but its three throws all land at the same time, colliding.

Some hold to a convention in that a siteswap is written with its highest numbers first. One drawback to doing so is evident in the pattern &quot;51414&quot;, a 3-ball pattern which cannot be inserted into the middle of a string of 3-throws, unlike its rotation &quot;45141&quot; which can.

==Synchronous==
Siteswap notation can be extended to denote patterns containing synchronous throws from both hands. The numbers for the two throws are combined in parentheses and separated by a comma. Since synchronous throws are only thrown on even beats, only even numbers are allowed. Throws that move to the other hand are marked by an &quot;x&quot; following the number. Thus a synchronous three-prop shower is denoted &quot;(4x,2x)&quot;, meaning one hand continually throws a low throw or &#x27;zip&#x27; to the opposite hand, while the other continually makes a higher throw to the first. Sequences of bracketed pairs are written without delimiting markers. Patterns that repeat in mirror image on the opposite side can be abbreviated with a *. For example, Instead of &quot;(4,2x)(2x,4)&quot; (3-ball box pattern), can be abbreviated to &quot;(4,2x)*&quot;.

==Multiplexing==
A further extension allows siteswap to notate patterns involving multiple throws from either or both hands at the same time in a multiplex pattern. The numbers for multiple throws from a single hand are written together inside square brackets. For example, &quot;[33]33&quot; is a normal 3-ball cascade, with a pair of balls always thrown together.

==Passing==
Simultaneous juggling: &quot;&lt;xxx|yyy&gt;&quot; notation means one juggler does &#x27;xxx&#x27; while another does &#x27;yyy&#x27;. &#x27;p&#x27; is used to represent a passing throw. For example, &quot;&lt;3p 3|3p 3&gt;&quot; is a 6 prop &#x27;2 count&#x27; passing pattern, where all left hand throws are passes and right hand throws are selves. This can also be used with synchronous patterns; a two-person &#x27;shower&#x27; is then &quot;&lt;(4xp,2x)|(4xp,2x)&gt;&quot;

===Fractional notation===
If the pattern contains fractions, e.g. &quot;&lt;4.5 3 3 | 3 4 3.5&gt;&quot; the juggler after the bar is supposed to be half a count later, and all fractions are passes. 

social siteswap

If both juggle the same pattern (although shifted in time), the pattern is called a social siteswap and only half of the pattern needs to be written: &quot;&lt;4p 3| 3 4p&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;4p 3&quot; and &quot;&lt;4.5 3 3| 3 4.5 3&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;4.5 3 3&quot;. (note that in the latter case, 4.5 will be straight passes from one juggler, crossing passes (i.e. left to left or right to right hand) from the other juggler.
Social siteswaps can also be created for more than 2 jugglers (e.g. 4p 3 3 or 3.7 3 for 3 jugglers, where 3.7 is meant to mean 3.66666... or 3 . Then each juggler should start count after the previous one.)

Note that some jugglers use fractions to note multi-handed patterns.

==Multi-handed==

Multi-hand notation was developed by Ed Carstens in 1992 for use with his juggling program JugglePro. Siteswap notation in its simplest form (&quot;Vanilla siteswap&quot;) assumes that only one ball is thrown at a time. It follows that any valid siteswap for two hands will also be valid for any number of hands, on the condition that the hands throw after each other. Commonly used multi-hand siteswaps are &quot;1-handed (diabolo) siteswap&quot;, and &quot;4-handed (passing) siteswap&quot;.

1-handed (diabolo) 

The siteswap is performed by a single hand, or a diabolo player throwing diabolos at different heights.

4-handed 

Valid siteswaps can be juggled by a 4-handed juggler, or for 2 jugglers coordinating 4 hands, on the condition that hands throw alternately.

In practice, this is most easily obtained if the jugglers throw by turns, one sequence being (Right hand of juggler A, right hand of juggler B, left hand of A, left hand of B).

mixed-up notation

Some jugglers, when noting 4-handed siteswap, divide the siteswap values by the number of jugglers. This leads to a fractional notation similar to the notation for social siteswaps, but the order of the notation can be different.

==State diagrams==

Just after throwing a ball (or club or other juggling object), all balls are in the air and are under the influence of gravity. Assuming the balls are caught at a consistent level, then the timing of when the balls land is already determined. We can mark each point in time when a ball is going to land with an &quot;x&quot;, and each point in time when there is not yet a ball scheduled to land with a &quot;-&quot;. This describes the current state and determines what number ball can be thrown next. For instance, we can look at the state just after our first throw in the diagram, it is xx--x. We can use the state to determine what can be thrown next. First we take the &quot;x&quot; off the left hand side (that&#x27;s the ball that&#x27;s landing next) and shift everything else to the left filling in a &quot;-&quot; on the right. This leaves us with x--x-. Since we caught a ball (the x we removed from the left) we can&#x27;t &quot;throw&quot; a 0 next. We also can&#x27;t throw a 1 or a 4, because there are already balls scheduled to land there. So assuming that the highest we can accurately throw a ball is to a height of 5, then we can only throw a 2, 3, or a 5. In this diagram, the juggler threw a 3, so an x goes in the third spot, replacing the -, and we have x-xx- as the new state.

The diagram shown illustrates all possible states for someone juggling three items and a maximum height of 5. From each state one can follow the arrows and the corresponding numbers produce the siteswap. Any path which produces a cycle generates a valid siteswap, and all siteswaps can be generated this way. The diagram quickly becomes bigger when more balls or higher throws are introduced as there are more possible states and more possible throws. 

Another method of representing siteswap states is represent a ball with a 1 instead of an x, and represent a spot where there&#x27;s no ball scheduled to land with a 0 instead of a -. Then the state can be represented with a binary number, such as binary 10011. This format makes it possible to represent multiplex states, i.e. the number 2 represents that 2 balls land on that beat.
A siteswap state diagram can also be represented as a state-transition table, as shown on the right. To generate a siteswap, pick a starting state row. Index into the row via the corresponding throw column. The state entry at the intersection is the transitioned to state when that throw is made. From the new state, one can index into the table again. This process can be repeated so that when the original state is reached, a valid siteswap will be created.

==Mathematical properties==

===Validity===

Not all siteswap sequences are valid. All vanilla, synchronous, and multiplex siteswap sequences are valid if their state transitions create a cycle in their state diagram graph. Sequences that do not create a cycle are invalid. For example, the pattern 531 can be mapped to a state diagram as shown on the right. Since the transitions in this sequence create a cycle in the graph, this pattern is valid.

There are other methods of determining a sequence&#x27;s validity based on the flavor of siteswap. 

A vanilla siteswap sequence formula_1where formula_2 is the period of the siteswap, is valid when the cardinality of the set formula_3 (written in Set-builder notation) is equal to the period formula_2 whereformula_5To find if a pattern is valid, first create a new sequence formed by adding formula_6 to the first number, formula_7 to the second number, formula_8 to the third number and so on. Second, calculate the modulus (remainder) of each number with the period. If none of the numbers are duplicated in this final sequence, then the pattern is valid.

For example, the pattern 531 would produce formula_9 or formula_10. Since the pattern 531 has a period of 3, the results from the previous example would produce formula_11or formula_12. In this case, 531 is valid since the numbers formula_12 are all unique. Another example, 513 is an invalid pattern because the first step produces formula_14 or formula_15, the second step produces formula_16 or formula_17, and the final sequence contains at least a duplicate of one number, in this case a 2. 

A synchronous siteswap is valid if 

# it only contains even numbers and
# it can be converted into a valid vanilla siteswap using the .

otherwise it is invalid.

=== Swap property ===
New valid vanilla sequences can be generated by swapping adjacent elements from another valid vanilla siteswap sequence, adding 1 to the number being swapped to the left and subtracting 1 from the number being swapped to the right. The swap property will convert the valid sequence formula_18 with arbitrary value formula_19, to generate the new valid sequence formula_20. 

For example, the swap property performed on the inner two throws of the sequence 4413 would move the 4 to the right subtracting 1 from it to become 3 and move the 1 to the left adding 1 to it to become 2. This produces the new valid siteswap pattern 4233.

=== Slide property ===
A valid synchronous sequence can be converted to a valid asynchronous sequence and vice versa using the slide property. Given the synchronous sequence formula_21, two new vanilla sequences can be formed: formula_22 and formula_23, whereformula_24andformula_25The slide property gets its name by sliding the throw times of one of the hands by one time unit so that the throws align asynchronously. For example, the siteswap (8x,4x)(4,4) would create two asynchronous (vanilla) siteswaps using the slide property: 9344 and 5744.

=== Prime patterns ===
Siteswaps may be considered either prime or composite. A siteswap is prime if the path created in its state diagram does not traverse any state more than once. Siteswaps that are not prime are called composite. 

A non-rigorous but simpler method of determining if a siteswap is prime is to try to split it into any valid shorter pattern which uses the same number of props. For example, 44404413 can be split into 4440, 441, and 3; therefore, 44404413 is a composite. Another example, 441, which uses three props, is prime, as 1, 4, 41, and 44 are not valid three prop patterns (as 1/1≠3, 4/1≠3, (4+1)/2≠3, and (4+4)/2≠3). Sometimes this process does not work; for example, 153 (better known by its rotation 531) looks like it can be split into 15 and 3, but checking that the cycle has no repeating nodes in the graph traversal indicates that it is prime by the more rigorous definition.

It has been shown empirically that the longest prime siteswaps bounded by height formula_26 contain mostly the throws formula_6 and formula_26. The longest prime patterns with height 22 (with 3 ball maximum), for 9 balls (with 13 maximum height), and for heights and ball counts in between, were enumerated by Jack Boyce in February 1999 using a program called jdeep. The full list of longest prime siteswaps generated by jdeep (with &#x27;0&#x27; throws represented by a &#x27;-&#x27; and maximum height throws represented by a &#x27;+&#x27;) can be found here.

== Mathematical connections ==

=== Connections to abstract algebra ===
Vanilla siteswap patterns may be viewed as certain elements of the affine symmetric group (the affine Weyl group of type formula_29). One presentation of this group is as the set of bijective functions &quot;f&quot; on the integers such that, for a fixed &quot;n&quot;: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot; + &quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) + &quot;n&quot; for all integers &quot;i&quot;. If the element &quot;f&quot; satisfies the further condition that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) ≥ &quot;i&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; corresponds to the (infinitely repeated) siteswap pattern whose &quot;i&quot;th number is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) − &quot;i&quot;: that is, the ball thrown at time &quot;i&quot; will land at time &quot;f&quot;(&quot;i&quot;).

=== Connections to topology ===
A subset of these siteswap patterns naturally label strata in the positroid stratification of the Grassmannian.

<doc id="520101" wikidata="Q3555063" url="?curid=520101" title="Lusitanian mythology">
<text>Lusitanian mythology is the mythology of the Lusitanians, an Indo-European speaking people of western Iberia, in what was then known as Lusitania. In present times, the territory comprises the central part of Portugal and small parts of Extremadura and Salamanca.

Lusitanian deities heavily influenced all of the religious practices in western Iberia, including Gallaecia as well. Lusitanian beliefs and practices intermingled with those of Roman deities after Lusitania was conquered. Recently, a Vasconian substrate is starting to be recognized.

==Deities==
===Main pantheon===
Through the Gallaecian-Roman inscriptions, a great pantheon of Gallaecian deities begins to emerge, sharing cults with other Celtic or Celticized peoples in the Iberian Peninsula, such as Astur — especially the more Western — or Lusitanian, but also the Gauls and Britons among others. However, because the borders shifted numerous times and Lusitanians and Gallaecians were often referred to as one people, it is relevant to note that some of the so-called Gallaecian or Lusitanian deities had the same names.

Of particular importance and popularity, especially following the Roman conquest, were a number of deities among whom were Endovelicus, Ataegina, Nabia and Trebaruna.

* Bandua or Bandi: their name appears in numerous dedications, mostly to a male deity (exceptionally, female in one), and often linked to a town or a location (e.g., &quot;Bandua Roudaeco&quot;, &quot;Etobrico&quot; or &quot;Brealiacui&quot;). The deity was probably the protector of the local community, often associated with the Roman Mars - possibly as the Gallaecian god of war - and in one dedication is considered a god or goddess of the Vexillum or standard. Appears to have enjoyed great success among the Gallaeci of Braga.
* Berobreus: god of the Otherworld and beyond. The largest shrine dedicated to Berobreo documented until now, stood in the fort of the Torch of Donón (Cangas), in the Morrazo&#x27;s Peninsula, front of the Cíes Islands.
* Bormanicus: god of hot springs similar to the Gaulish god, Bormanus.

* Nabia: may have been two separate deities, one invoked in tandem with Jupiter, possibly as the consort of the local Lusitanian equivalent; and another identified with Diana, Juno or Victoria (and Roman deities), linked to the protection and defense of the community or health, wealth and fertility. She was also associated with earth and sacred springs, possibly as the deity of water, fountains and rivers. Her name still endures in Galicia and Portugal, such as river Navia, and the Idol Fountain, located in northern Portugal.

* Cossus, warrior god, who attained great popularity among the Southern Gallaeci, was one of the most revered gods in ancient Gallaecia. Several authors suggest that Cosso and Bandua are the same God under different names.
* Reue - Krzysztof Tomasz Witczak suggests he may be the equivalent of the Roman Iovis or Jupiter, both names ultimately deriving from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*diewo-&quot;.
* Lugus, or Lucubo, linked to prosperity, trade and craft occupations. His figure is associated with the spear. It is one of gods most common among the Celts and many, many place names derived from it throughout Europe Celtic Galicia (Galicia Lucus Latinized form) to Loudoun (Scotland), and even the naming of people as &quot;Gallaecia Louguei&quot;.
* Coventina, goddess of abundance and fertility. Strongly associated with the water nymphs, their cult record for most Western Europe, from England to Gallaecia.
* Endovelicus (Belenus) - taken to have been a god of prophecy and healing, with oracular functions. He appears to have been a minor chthonic god originally, but has become exceptionally popular after Roman colonization.
* Epona was a protector of horses, donkeys, and mules. She was particularly a goddess of fertility, as shown by her attributes of a patera, cornucopia, ears of grain and the presence of foals in some sculptures. She and her horses might also have been leaders of the soul in the after-life ride, with parallels in Rhiannon of the Mabinogion. Unusual for a Celtic deity, most of whom were associated with specific localities, the worship of Epona, &quot;the sole Celtic divinity ultimately worshipped in Rome itself,&quot; was widespread in the Roman Empire between the first and third centuries AD.
* Trebaruna appears in inscriptions in the Lusitanian language associated with another, presumably male deity named &quot;Reve&quot;. 

There is hardly any sign of Bandua, Reue, Arentius-Arentia, Quangeius, Munidis, Trebaruna, Laneana and Nabia — all worshipped in the heart of Lusitania — outside the boundary with the Vettones. Bandua, Reue and Nabia were worshiped in the core area of Lusitania (including Northern Extremadura to Beira Baixa and Northern Lusitania) and reaching inland Galicia, the diffusion of these gods throughout the whole of the northern interior area shows a cultural continuity with Central Lusitania.

===Other deities===

Two regional deities in Western Iberia do not occur in the region: Crouga, worshiped around Viseu, and Aernus, in the Bragança area. The largest number of indigenous deities found in the whole Iberian Peninsula are located in the Lusitanian-Galician regions, and models proposing a fragmented and disorganized pantheon have been discarded, since the number of deities occurring together is similar to those of other Celtic peoples in Europe and ancient civilizations.

Toga, female deity of the known Lusitanian mythology. Her name is in inscriptions found on Vettone and Lusitanian territory but the cult is thought to have Vettone origins.

A sun goddess, Kontebria (Cantabria), was apparently present, her worship later being assimilated into Virgin Mary&#x27;s Nossa Senhora de Antime figure.

Dii, Lares, Nymphs and Genii were the main types of divinity worshiped, known from the Latin epigraphy, although many names are recorded in the Lusitanian or Celtiberian languages.

<doc id="520121" wikidata="Q288568" url="?curid=520121" title="International Collegiate Programming Contest">
<text>The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world. Directed by ICPC Executive &quot;Director&quot; and Baylor Professor William B. Poucher, the ICPC operates autonomous regional contests covering six continents culminating in a global World Finals every year. In 2018, ICPC participation included 52,709 students from 3,233 universities in 110 countries.

The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation and operates under agreements with host universities and non-profits, all in accordance with the ICPC Policies and Procedures. From 1977 until 2017 ICPC was held under the auspices of ACM and was referred to as ACM-ICPC.

==History==
The ICPC traces its roots to a competition held at Texas A&amp;M University in 1970 hosted by the Alpha chapter of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Computer Science Honor Society (UPE). This initial programming competition was titled First Annual Texas Collegiate Programming Championship and each university was represented by a team of up to five members. The computer used was a IBM System/360 model 65 which was one of the first machines with a DAT (Dynamic Address Translator aka &quot;paging&quot;) system for accessing memory. Teams that participated included Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, University of Houston, and five or six other Texas University / Colleges. There were three problems that had to be completed and the cumulative time from &quot;start&quot; to &quot;successful completion&quot; determined first-, second-, and third-place winners. The programming language used was Fortran. The programs were written on coding sheets, keypunched on Hollerith cards, and submitted for execution. The University of Houston team won the competition completing all three problems successfully with time. The second- and third-place teams did not successfully complete all three problems. The contest evolved into its present form as a multi-tier competition in 1977, with the first finals held in conjunction with the ACM Computer Science Conference.

From 1977 to 1989, the contest included mainly teams of four from universities throughout the United States and Canada. ICPC Headquarters was hosted by Baylor University from 1989 until 2022, with regional contests established within the world&#x27;s university community, the ICPC has grown into a worldwide competition. To increase access to the World Finals, teams were reduced to three students within their first five academic years.

From 1997 to 2017, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was the sponsor of ICPC. During that time contest participation has grown by more than 2000%. In 1997, 840 teams from 560 universities participated. In 2017, 46,381 students from 2,948 universities in 103 countries on six continents participated in regional competitions. Organized as a highly localized extra-curricular university mind sport and operating as a globally-coordinated unincorporated association operating under agreements with host universities and non-profits, the ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world.

UPE has provided continuous support since 1970 and honored World Finalists since the first Finals in 1976. The ICPC is indebted to ACM member contributions and ACM assistance from 1976 to 2018. Baylor University served since 1985, hosting ICPC Headquarters from 1989 until 2022. The ICPC operates under the auspices of the ICPC Foundation which provides the ICPC Global Headquarters to service a globally-coordinated community whose events operate under agreements with host universities and non-profits to insure that participation in ICPC is open to qualified teams from every university in the world. See ICPC Policies and Procedures.

The ICPC World Finals (The Annual World Finals of the International Collegiate Programming Contest) is the final round of competition. Over its history it has become a 4-day event held in the finest venues worldwide with 140 teams competing in the 2018 World Finals. Recent World Champion teams have been recognized by their country&#x27;s head of state. In recent years, media impressions have hovered at the one billion mark.

From 2000 to 2022, only teams from Russia, China, and Poland have won the ICPC world finals. Participation in North America is much smaller than in the rest of the world, which is partially attributed to the perceived low payoff of participating.

==Contest rules==
ICPC contests are team competitions. Current rules stipulate that each team consist of three students. Participants must be university students, who have had less than five years of university education before the contest. Students who have previously competed in two World Finals or five regional competitions are ineligible to compete again.

During each contest, the teams of three are given 5 hours to solve between eight and fifteen programming problems (with eight typical for regionals and twelve for finals). They must submit solutions as programs in C, C++, Java, Ada, Python or Kotlin (although it is not guaranteed every problem is solvable in any certain language, the ICPC website states that &quot;the judges will have solved all problems in Java and C++&quot; for both regional and world finals competitions). Programs are then run on test data. If a program fails to give a correct answer, the team is notified and can submit another program.

The winner is the team which correctly solves the most problems. If necessary to rank teams for medals or prizes among tying teams, the placement of teams is determined by the sum of the elapsed times at each point that they submitted correct solutions plus 20 minutes for each rejected submission of a problem ultimately solved. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.

Compared to other programming contests (for example, International Olympiad in Informatics), the ICPC is characterized by a large number of problems (eight or more problems in just 5 hours). Another feature is that each team can use only one computer, although teams have three students. This makes the time pressure even greater. Good teamwork and ability to withstand pressure is needed to win.

To synchronize with the schedule after all rescheduling because of Covid-19 pandemic both 46-th and 47-th world finals were scheduled to take place in the same time in November 2023 in Sharm El Sheikh. Because of Israel–Hamas war and related safety concerns, it was rescheduled once again and finally happened in Luxor in April from 14th to 19 April 2024. To avoid confusion about dates, the event was referred to as World Finals Luxor (World Finals Sharm before rescheduling), with two competitions as 46th and 47th separately, if needed, in all official materials.

Two competitions were held in parallel, with intersecting problem sets. In 47-th finals, due to very close results (less than 40 penalty minutes difference between 12 and 16 place), additional bronze medals were awarded at the next finals in Astana.

<text>Louis Rasminsky, (February 1, 1908 – September 15, 1998) was the third governor of the Bank of Canada from 1961 to 1973, succeeding James Coyne. He was succeeded by Gerald Bouey.

Born in Montreal, he was raised in Toronto, graduated at Harbord Collegiate Institute, educated at the University of Toronto and the London School of Economics. In 1930, he started at the Economic and Financial Organization of the League of Nations as a specialist in monetary and banking issues. He joined the Bank of Canada in 1940, becoming executive assistant to the Governors of the Bank from 1943 to 1954 and Deputy Governor in 1955.

He served as Canada&#x27;s executive director at the International Monetary Fund from 1946 until 1962. He was also executive director at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1950 to 1962.

In 1968, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada&#x27;s highest civilian honour, &quot;for his services to Canada and a life-long career in the fields of international economic affairs and central banking&quot;. In 1968, he was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Award, the highest honour in the Public Service of Canada. He was the first Canadian to receive an honorary degree from Yeshiva University. He also received honorary degrees from Carleton University, Trent University, the University of British Columbia and Concordia University (1975).

In the 1960s, the Rideau Club in Ottawa declined to admit Rasminsky because he was Jewish. It succumbed to pressure from Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, among others.

Canadian historian Bruce Muirhead received the Joseph and Fay Tanenbaum Award for Canadian Jewish History for his biography of Rasminsky, &quot;Against the Odds: The Public Life and Times of Louis Rasminsky&quot; (University of Toronto Press, 1999).

His daughter, Lola Rasminsky, is the founder and director of the Avenue Road Arts School in Toronto. His son, Dr. Michael Rasminsky, practices neurology at the Montreal General Hospital.

<text>Easdale () is one of the Slate Islands, in the Firth of Lorn, Scotland. Once the centre of the Scottish slate industry, there has been some recent island regeneration by the owners. This is the smallest of the Inner Hebrides&#x27; inhabited islands and is &quot;home to traditional white-washed cottages, a small pub and disused slate quarries&quot;. One of the latter, filled with water, is used for swimming.

A ferry sails from Easdale to Ellenabeich (Gaelic: &quot;Eilean nam Beathach&quot;) on the nearby island of Seil (Gaelic: &quot;Saoil&quot;), which is separated from Easdale by only a narrow channel. Confusingly, Ellenabeich is sometimes known as &quot;Easdale&quot; as a result of its traditional connections with the island.

==Etymology==
In 1549, Donald Monro, &quot;Dean of the Isles&quot; wrote, in brief reference to Easdale, of an island &quot;namit in the Erische Leid Ellan Eisdcalfe&quot; However the derivation of &quot;Eisdcalfe&quot; and this word&#x27;s etymological relationship to &quot;Easdale&quot; is not clear. Haswell Smith (2004) notes that &quot;eas&quot; is Gaelic for &quot;waterfall&quot; and &quot;dal&quot; is Norse for &quot;valley&quot;. Nonetheless, it is not clear why either description should apply to the island which is low lying and has no waterfalls.

The Gaelic name, &quot;Èisdeal&quot; () or &quot;Eilean Èisdeal&quot; has a long vowel and local folk legend attributes this to a derivation from &quot;èist thall&quot; &quot;listen to that yonder&quot;. Gaelic Place-Names of Scotland states that the first element is obscure, the second Norse &quot;dalr&quot;. It is not clear if this &quot;Èisdeal&quot; shares its derivation with Gleann Èisdeal (Glen Ashdale) (Glen of Ash trees) on the Isle of Arran.

Ellenbeich is usually analysed as &quot;Eilean nam Beathach&quot; () &quot;island of the animals&quot; but this may be a reflex of an earlier and homophonous form &quot;Eilean nam Beitheach&quot; &quot;island of the birch trees&quot;.

==History==
Once a centre of the British slate industry, Easdale had a community of more than 500 working as many as seven quarries, some of which extended to below sea level. Easdale slate helped to build major cities of the British Empire and can still be seen on rooftops as far afield as Melbourne, Nova Scotia, Dunedin and Dublin. The great storm of 1850 flooded the majority of the quarries and, as the islanders were unable to extract the floodwater, most were abandoned. The last slate was cut in the 1950s and the once active quarries are little more than still pools which provide a safe haven for a wide variety of flora and bird life.

Nearby the former island Eilean-a-beithich once stood in the Easdale Sound between Easdale and Seil; however, it was quarried to a depth of below sea level leaving only the outer rim of the island. This was eventually swept away by the sea and little visible sign of the island now remains.

By the early 1960s, the population had dwindled to only four people and the island appeared doomed. The island now has a population of around sixty people and is the smallest permanently inhabited island of the Inner Hebrides. The Scottish plant collector Clara Winsome Muirhead surveyed the plant life of the island and published &quot;The Flora of Easdale and the Garvellachs&quot; in 1962.

British indie rock band Florence and the Machine filmed their double-feature music video for their singles &quot;Queen of Peace&quot; and &quot;Long &amp; Lost&quot; on the island, with the videos using the villagers as the cast.

==Current ownership==
The island is owned by Jonathan Feigenbaum, who operates the Easdale Island Company; he succeeded his late father Clive Feigenbaum (the former chairman of Stanley Gibbons). Clive created local issues of stamps, and Jonathan has continued doing this.

==Facilities and activities==
The island is home to a folk museum owned and operated by the Eilean Eisdeal, a development trust, as well as a bar/restaurant called &quot;The Puffer&quot;. Eilean Eisdeal spearheaded the renovation of the Easdale Island Community Hall, which provides a venue for a wide variety of events. According to Mike Scott of the Waterboys: &quot;The Hall itself is magical. From the first sighting of its pyramid roof and arced frontispiece across the water to stepping off its stage at the end of the concert, it cast a spell on us.&quot;

In 2005 the local authority, Argyll and Bute Council, discussed plans to build a bridge between the island and Seil, linking the island to the mainland by road, despite there being no roads on Easdale. A company who operate high speed boat trips to view wild life and other local places of interest in the area have their base on Easdale.

The World Stone Skimming Championship has taken place annually in September on Easdale since 1997. In 2012 the event came under threat after Jonathan Feigenbaum requested £1,000 for using the slate quarry the championship uses. The competition only went ahead after the &quot;Press and Journal&quot; newspaper offered to pay the fee. A community buyout of the island by residents is now under consideration. Mike Russell, MSP for Argyll and Bute, said: &quot;Not every community will achieve it and not every community should achieve it. But it is a live issue and becomes even more live in circumstances such as these.&quot;

The island gets some tourists and has some facilities, activities for visitors, B&amp;Bs and two restaurants.

<text>James Elliott Coyne, (July 17, 1910 – October 12, 2012) was the second governor of the Bank of Canada, from 1955 to 1961, succeeding Graham Towers. During his time in office, he had a much-publicized debate with Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, a debate often referred to as the &quot;Coyne Affair&quot; (or sometimes the &quot;Coyne Crisis&quot;), which led to his resignation and, eventually, to greater central-bank independence in Canada.

==Life and career==
Coyne was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the son of Edna Margaret (née Elliott) and James Bowes Coyne, a judge at the Manitoba Court of Appeal, who was co-prosecutor of the men accused of seditious conspiracy in the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. His grandfather was lawyer and historian James Henry Coyne. Coyne graduated Ridley College in St. Catharines, Ontario in 1925, and had conferred upon him a BA in 1931 from the University of Manitoba. He studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, playing for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club, and in 1934 received a B.A. Jurisprudence and BCL. During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.

From 1944 to 1949, Coyne was executive assistant to Graham Towers at the Bank of Canada and from 1950 until 1954 was Deputy Governor. He was appointed Governor in 1955, resigned in 1961, and was succeeded by Louis Rasminsky.

He was the father of journalist Andrew Coyne and actress and playwright Susan Coyne, and stepfather of Sanford Riley, Patrick Riley and Nancy Riley. He was also an uncle of constitutional lawyer Deborah Coyne.

===The Coyne Affair===
The Coyne Affair, or the Coyne Crisis, was a public disagreement between Coyne, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, and the Progressive Conservative (PC) government of John Diefenbaker, notably Donald Fleming, the Minister of Finance.

As Governor, Coyne heavily criticized the government&#x27;s fiscal policies, which saw the Diefenbaker government spend and borrow heavily in an effort to stimulate growth amid a flagging economy. Government officials urged Coyne to lower interest rates and create economic activity. Coyne disagreed, arguing that loose money policies were creating a debt crisis and that Canada was relying too much on capital exports and loans from the United States, and thus a tightening was needed instead. In speeches and brochures, he criticized the government&#x27;s expansionary policies. The government took the position that an elected government, especially one elected with a large mandate, should direct monetary policy.

Matters came to a head when Coyne raised his own pension to $25,000, which Diefenbaker deemed excessive when he himself had no entitlement to one. The PC majority in the House of Commons passed a bill declaring his position vacant, but the Liberal-controlled Senate rejected it. Nevertheless, Coyne resigned the next day. For his role in this controversy, the Canadian Press named him Canadian Newsmaker of the Year in 1961.
==Honours==

* He was given the Honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Manitoba in 1961.
* He was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 
*He was appointed a member of the Order of Manitoba in 2012. Coyne died in Winnipeg on October 12, 2012.

<doc id="520172" wikidata="Q1643588" url="?curid=520172" title="David Perry (game developer)">
<text>David Perry (born 4 April 1967) is a Northern Irish video game developer and programmer. He became prominent for programming platform games for 16-bit home consoles in the early to mid 1990s, including &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Cool Spot&quot;, and the &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; series. He founded Shiny Entertainment, where he worked from 1993 to 2006. Perry created games for companies such as Disney, 7 Up, McDonald&#x27;s, Hemdale, and Warner Bros. In 2008 he was presented with an honorary doctorate from Queen&#x27;s University Belfast for his services to computer gaming. He was the co-founder &amp; CEO of cloud-based games service Gaikai, which was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment. In 2017 Perry became the co-founder &amp; CEO of a customer intelligence startup called GoVYRL, Inc. developing a new advanced brand dashboard called Carro.

==Biography==

Perry was born in April 1967 in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, growing up in the towns of Templepatrick and Donegore in County Antrim, attending Templepatrick Primary School and then Methodist College Belfast.

He began writing computer game programming books in 1982 at the age of 15, creating his own games for the Sinclair ZX81. In an interview with the BBC, Perry stated that his first game was a driving game, &quot;a black blob avoiding other black blobs&quot;, which he wrote and sent to a magazine, which printed it. He sent them more games and they sent him a cheque for £450: a bit of a problem for a teenager who did not yet have a bank account. His work continued until he was offered a job for £3,500/year as an apprentice to a veteran programmer who taught him more advanced programming.

At the age of 17, he moved to London, where he developed games with Mikro-Gen and Probe Software for publishers such as Elite Systems and Mirrorsoft, working on titles such as the ZX Spectrum conversion of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1991) for NES and the Sega Genesis version of &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1992). Perry&#x27;s work on &quot;The Terminator&quot; caught the attention of Virgin Mastertronic, which was expanding into the United States and had entered a deal with McDonald&#x27;s to publish a video game themed around its restaurants within six months. Perry responded to Virgin&#x27;s generous employment offer into their American development branch in Irvine, California, and was granted an apartment overlooking Laguna Beach, which he remarked was &quot;like living in &quot;Baywatch&quot;&quot;. Although Perry had planned to return to the United Kingdom upon the game&#x27;s completion, the unexpected critical success of &quot;Global Gladiators&quot; (1992) convinced him to stay in California; as he recalled, &quot;it suddenly made people appreciate me&quot;.

While at Virgin, Perry led the development duties for several award-winning games for the Genesis, including &quot;Cool Spot&quot; (1993) and &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1993). His work within &quot;Virgin Games&quot; also served as a basis for the development of other games such as the Sega CD version of &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1993) and the Genesis versions of &quot;RoboCop Versus The Terminator&quot; (1994) and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s The Jungle Book&quot; (1994), all of them developed after David Perry had left the studio.

On 1 October 1993, Perry formed his own company in Laguna Beach, California, Shiny Entertainment, naming the company after the song &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; by R.E.M. The company&#x27;s first game &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; (1994) was a hit, selling millions of copies on multiple platforms, including Sega Genesis, Super NES and PC. The title character, an &quot;average worm&quot; who stumbles upon a space suit which turns him into a superhero, became immensely popular, and spawned a variety of other types of merchandise: action figures, comic books, and a syndicated television cartoon series.

Listing Perry in their &quot;75 Most Important People in the Games Industry of 1995&quot;, &quot;Next Generation&quot; argued that his success had as much to do with his exceptional knack for public relations as his talent as a developer: &quot;Perry often seems to benefit and suffer from a game press who seemingly can&#x27;t hype him or his products enough. Is all the hype justified? Well, probably not. But that&#x27;s not the point, the fact is that the press and gamers love him. &quot;Next Generation&quot;″s opinion as to Perry&#x27;s PR secrets? Always return phone calls, don&#x27;t make promises you can&#x27;t keep, and show a genuine interest in whomever you&#x27;re talking to. Sounds easy? So how come hardly any actual PR people (let alone presidents and lead programmers) in the industry do the same?&quot;

In 2002, Shiny Entertainment was acquired by Atari, Inc. for US$47 million, with Perry signed to a long-term contract to continue on as president. Also in 2002, Perry collaborated with The Wachowskis on games in coordination with their &quot;Matrix&quot; series of movies.

In 2006, he resigned from Shiny, and formed GameConsultants.com, a consultancy firm planning to offer executive level video game industry advice, followed by GameInvestors.com, a business-to-business company to help video game development teams get funded. He recounted, &quot;I was working on a new game design for Infogrames (Atari) called Plague and was incredibly excited about it. Atari called and told me they had run out of money, and so I offered to find a buyer for my team, they said they’d handle it and I moved on. The first phone call I had after leaving was with The Collective, and they ended up buying Shiny.&quot;

Perry is on the advisory board for the Game Developers Conference, and has spoken at industry venues such as E3, CES, Hollywood and Games, Digital Hollywood, iHollywood, SIGGRAPH, Entertainment in the Interactive Age, What Teens Want, The Banff Summit, as well as at major universities such as USC, and MIT. In 2006, he co-hosted the annual Game Developers Choice Awards with Tommy Tallarico.

In November 2008, Perry co-founded Gaikai in the Netherlands, a company that released game streaming technology in late 2009. In July 2012, Gaikai was sold to Sony Computer Entertainment for $380 million.

In January 2016, Perry confirmed that he and Michael Jackson had been discussing making a video game together prior to the singer&#x27;s death.

In July 2017 Perry left Gaikai, joining startup GoVYRL, Inc. to build new technology for brands to work with influencers; the technology is called Carro. GoVYRL, Inc. has seed investments from entities including The Cove Fund, Brendan Iribe and Alpha Edison.

<doc id="520178" wikidata="Q1631137" url="?curid=520178" title="King's Privy Council for Canada">
<text>The King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada (), sometimes called His Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada or simply the Privy Council (PC), is the full group of personal consultants to the monarch of Canada on state and constitutional affairs. Practically, the tenets of responsible government require the sovereign or his viceroy, the governor general, to almost always follow only that advice tendered by the Cabinet: a committee within the Privy Council composed usually of elected members of Parliament. Those summoned to the Privy Council are appointed for life by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister, meaning that the group is composed predominantly of former Cabinet ministers, with some others having been inducted as an honorary gesture. Privy counsellors are accorded the use of an honorific style and post-nominal letters, as well as various signifiers of precedence.

== -in-Council ==
The Government of Canada, which is formally referred to as &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government&quot;, is defined by the Canadian constitution as the sovereign acting on the advice of the Privy Council; what is known as the &quot;Governor-in-Council&quot;, referring to the governor general of Canada as the &#x27;s stand-in. The group of people is described as &quot;a Council to aid and advise in the Government of Canada, to be styled the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada&quot;, though, by convention, the task of giving the sovereign and governor general advice (in the construct of constitutional monarchy and responsible government, this is typically binding) on how to exercise the royal prerogative via orders-in-council rests with the Cabinet—a committee of the Privy Council made up of other ministers of the Crown who are drawn from, and responsible to, the House of Commons in the Parliament. This body is distinct but also entwined within the Privy Council, as the president of the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada customarily serves as one of its members and Cabinet ministers receive assistance in the performance of their duties from the Privy Council Office, headed by the clerk of the Privy Council.

While the Cabinet specifically deals with the regular, day-to-day functions of the King-in-Council, occasions of wider national importance—such as the proclamation of a new Canadian sovereign following a demise of the Crown or conferring on royal marriages—will be attended to by more senior officials in the Privy Council, such as the prime minister, the chief justice of Canada, and other senior statesmen; though all privy councillors are invited to such meetings in theory, in practice, the composition of the gathering is determined by the prime minister of the day. The quorum for Privy Council meetings is four.

==Membership==
The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, outlines that persons are to be summoned and appointed for life to the King&#x27;s Privy Council by the governor general, though convention dictates that this be done on the advice of the sitting prime minister. As its function is to provide the vehicle for advising the Crown, the members of the Privy Council are predominantly all living current and former ministers of the Crown. In addition, the chief justices of Canada and former governors general are appointed. From time to time, the leader of His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition and heads of other opposition parties will be appointed to the Privy Council, either as an honour or to facilitate the distribution of sensitive information under the &quot;Security of Information Act&quot; and, similarly, it is required by law that those on the Security Intelligence Review Committee be made privy councillors, if they are not already. To date, only Prime Minister Paul Martin advised that parliamentary secretaries be admitted to the Privy Council.
Appointees to the King&#x27;s Privy Council must recite the requisite oath:

Provincial premiers are not commonly appointed to the Privy Council, but have been made members on special occasions, such as the centennial of Confederation in 1967 and the patriation of the constitution of Canada in 1982. On Canada Day in 1992, which also marked the 125th anniversary of Canadian Confederation, Governor General Ramon Hnatyshyn appointed 18 prominent Canadians to the Privy Council, including the former Premier of Ontario David Peterson, retired hockey star Maurice Richard, and businessman Conrad Black (who was later expelled from the Privy Council by the Governor General on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper). The use of Privy Council appointments as purely an honour was not employed again until 6 February 2006, when Harper advised the Governor General to appoint former member of Parliament John Reynolds, along with the new Cabinet. Harper, on 15 October 2007, also advised Governor General Michaëlle Jean to appoint Jim Abbott.
Members of the monarch&#x27;s family have been appointed to the Privy Council: Prince Edward (later King Edward VIII), appointed by his father, King George V, on 2 August 1927; Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, appointed by his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, on 14 October 1957; and Prince Charles (now King Charles III), appointed by his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on 18 May 2014.

On occasion, non-Canadians have been appointed to the Privy Council. The first non-Canadian sworn of the council was Billy Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, who was inducted on 18 February 1916, at the request of Robert Borden—to honour a visiting head of government, but also so that Hughes could attend Cabinet meetings on wartime policy. Similarly, Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, was inducted during a visit to Canada on 29 December 1941.

Privy councillors are entitled to the style &quot;the Honourable&quot; () or, for the prime minister, chief justice, or certain other eminent individuals, &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; () and the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; (in ). Prior to 1967, the style &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; was only employed in Canada by those appointed to the Imperial Privy Council in London, such persons usually being prime ministers, Supreme Court chief justices, certain senior members of the Canadian Cabinet, and other eminent Canadians. These appointments ended under Lester Pearson, though the traditional style remained in use, limited to only prime ministers and chief justices. In 1992, several eminent privy councillors, most of whom were long-retired from active politics, were granted the style by the Governor General and, in 2002, Jean Chrétien recommended that Herb Gray, a privy councillor of long standing, be given the style &quot;the Right Honourable&quot; upon his retirement from Parliament.

==History==
According to Eugene Forsey, Privy Council meetings—primarily meetings of the full Cabinet or the prime minister and senior ministers, held with the governor general presiding—were not infrequent occurrences in the first 15 years following Canadian Confederation in 1867. One example of a Privy Council meeting presided over by the governor general occurred on 15 August 1873, in which Governor General the Earl of Dufferin outlined &quot;the terms on which he would agree to a prorogation of Parliament&quot; during the Pacific Scandal. When he served as viceroy, John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, put an end to the practice of the governor general presiding over Privy Council meetings, other than for ceremonial occasions.

Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had the Privy Council convene in 1947 to consent to the marriage of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) to Philip Mountbatten, per the Royal Marriages Act 1772. The Princess&#x27; father, King George VI, had offered an invitation for Mackenzie King to attend when the Privy Council of the United Kingdom met for the same purpose. But, the Prime Minister declined and held the meeting of the Canadian Privy Council so as to illustrate the separation between Canada&#x27;s Crown and that of the UK.
The Council has assembled in the presence of the sovereign on two occasions: The first was at 10:00 a.m. on the Thanksgiving Monday of 1957, at the monarch&#x27;s residence in Ottawa, Rideau Hall. There, Queen Elizabeth II chaired a meeting of 22 of her privy councilors, including her consort, by then titled as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, whom Elizabeth had just appointed to the Privy Council at that same meeting. The Queen also approved an order-in-council. Two years later, the Privy Council again met before the Queen, this time in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to confirm the appointment of Georges Vanier as governor general. There was originally some speculation that the coming together of the sovereign and her Council was not constitutionally sound. However, the Prime Minister at the time, John Diefenbaker, found no legal impropriety in the idea and desired to create a physical illustration of Elizabeth&#x27;s position of Queen of Canada being separate to that of Queen of the United Kingdom.

A formal meeting of the Privy Council was held in 1981 to give formal consent to the marriage of Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (now King Charles III), to Lady Diana Spencer. According to a contemporary newspaper account, the conference, on 27 March, at Rideau Hall, consisted of 12 individuals, including Chief Justice Bora Laskin, who presided over the meeting; Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau; several cabinet ministers; Stanley Knowles of the New Democratic Party; and Alvin Hamilton of the Progressive Conservative Party. All gathered were informed of the Prince&#x27;s engagement, nodded their approval, and then toasted the royal couple with champagne. David Brown, an official in the Privy Council Office, told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that, had the Privy Council rejected the Prince of Wales&#x27; engagement, none of his children would have been considered legitimate heirs to the Canadian throne, thus setting up a potential break in the unified link to the crown of each of the Commonwealth realms, in contradiction to the conventional &quot;treaty&quot; laid out in the preamble to the 1931 Statute of Westminster. Following the announcement of the Prince of Wales&#x27; engagement to Camilla Parker-Bowles, however, the Department of Justice announced its conclusion that the Privy Council was not required to meet to give its approval to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring that would impact the succession to the throne.

To mark the occasion of her Ruby Jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II, on Canada Day, 1992, presided over the swearing in of new members of her Privy Council.

The most recent formal meeting of the Privy Council was on 10 September 2022, for the proclamation of the accession of King Charles III.

<text>Hugh Loebner (March 26, 1942 - December 4, 2016) was an American inventor and social activist, who was notable for sponsoring the Loebner Prize, an embodiment of the Turing test. Loebner held six United States Patents, and was also an outspoken advocate for the decriminalization of prostitution.

== Loebner prize==

Loebner established the Loebner Prize in 1990. He pledged to give $100,000 and a solid gold medal to the first programmer able to write a program whose communicative behavior can fool humans into thinking that the program is human. The competition has been repeated annually and has been hosted by various organizations. Within the field of artificial intelligence, the Loebner Prize is somewhat controversial; the most prominent critic, Marvin Minsky, has called it a publicity stunt that does not help the field along.

Loebner also liked to point out that, unlike the solid gold medal for the Loebner prize, the gold medals of the Olympic Games are not solid gold, but are made of silver covered with a thin layer of gold.

Fascinated by Alan Turing&#x27;s imitation game, and considering creating a system himself to pass it, Loebner realized that even if he were to succeed in developing a computer that could pass the Turing test, no avenue existed in which to prove it.

In his letter to Dr. Robert Epstein, written on December 30, 1988 , Loebner authorized Dr. Epstein to move forward with a contest, and referring to the Turing Test, Loebner wrote: &quot;Robert, in years to come, there may be richer prizes, and more prestigious contests, but gads, this will always be the oldest.&quot; Establishing the Loebner Prize, he introduced the Turing Test to a wider public, and stimulated interest in this science. It remains Hugh Loebner’s desire to advance AI, and for the Turing Test to serve as a tool to measure the state of the art: &quot;There is a nobility in this endeavour. If we humans can succeed in developing an artificial intellect it will be a measure of the scope of our intellect&quot; (from: &quot;In Response&quot;, 1994) .

==Prostitution==
Loebner was open about his visits to prostitutes. In 1994, after a campaign by officials in New York City to arrest customers of prostitutes, he wrote an opposing letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which was published. In 1996, he authored a &quot;Magna Carta for Sex Work&quot; or&quot; Manifesto of Sexual Freedom&quot;, in which he denounced the criminalization of consensual sexual acts, and asked all like minded people to join a protest on June 9, 1996 (a play on the 69 sex position). In interviews, he stated that he believed himself to be too old for the young attractive women he is interested in; they would not have sex with him were it not for the money. He has compared the oppression of prostitutes and their customers to the oppression that Alan Turing faced because of his homosexual behavior.

==Personal life==
Loebner held a Ph.D. in demography from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst. He was divorced, lived in New York City, and owned Crown Industries, a manufacturer of crowd control stanchion and brass fittings, which is the major sponsor of the Loebner Prize in the US.

==Death==
On December 4, 2016, Hugh&#x27;s ex-wife, Elaine Loebner, announced on Twitter that Hugh had &quot;died peacefully in his sleep&quot;. He was 74 years old.

<text>London Business School (LBS) is a business school and a constituent college of the federal University of London. LBS was founded in 1964 and awards post-graduate degrees (Master&#x27;s degrees in management and finance, MBA and PhD). Its motto is &quot;To have a profound impact on the way the world does business&quot;.

The main campus is located at Sussex Place in London, adjacent to Regent&#x27;s Park. In 2012, the school acquired the Marylebone Town Hall and spent £60 million to refurbish it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70% - the new building is called The Sammy Ofer Centre. In 2017, it was announced that LBS had also acquired the site of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who vacated the building in November 2019.
LBS has a secondary campus in Dubai that is dedicated to Executive Education and the Dubai EMBA.

==History==

=== Foundation ===

London Business School was founded in 1964 under the name of the &quot;&#x27;London Graduate School of Business Studies&#x27;,&quot; with Dr. Arthur Earle as Dean. In 1965, the school was registered as a company and was designated by the University of London as an institution having recognised teachers. In 1966, the first Executive Development Programme was launched, followed by the Senior Executive Programme. The same year, a full-time MSc degree was also launched, with Sheila Cross enrolling as the School&#x27;s first female student. In 1968, the School inaugurated the Sloan Fellowship MSc programme, which was the first one outside of the US. 17 students were enrolled and the programme was funded by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation. The first doctoral programme was established in 1969 and in 1970 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the School&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park campus. The first PhD was awarded in 1974, and that year women made up over 15% of the student body for the first time. In 1983, the first part-time MBA programme was held under the direction of Sir Andrew Likierman, a former Dean of the School. In 1986, the school officially became the &quot;London Business School&quot; and was incorporated by Royal Charter, which gave LBS the right to confer and grant degrees. In 1992, the School was given the Queen&#x27;s Award for Export in recognition of providing educational services to managers and companies worldwide. The following year, the school started its first Masters in Finance programme and in 2001, the EMBA-Global degree programme in partnership with the Columbia Business School.

In 2007 a new campus was opened in Dubai to offer both Executive MBA and Executive Education Programmes. In 2009, the school started two new programmes: The EMBA-Global Asia, in partnership with the University of Hong Kong and Columbia Business School, and the Masters in Management (MiM). In 2012, the school acquired Marylebone Town Hall and restored it with the objective of expanding its teaching facilities by 70 per cent. The building was renamed &quot;The Sammy Ofer Centre&quot; in honour of a generous donor, the Ofer Family, who made a gift for the development of the building, which was opened in 2017. In 2016, LBS launched a new programme, the Masters in Financial Analysis, aimed at recent graduates who wish to pursue a career in finance, and acquired the lease of the neighbouring building of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaenocologists, which it will occupy in 2020.

With the objective of increasing its size, the school organised a £100 million funding campaign. By the beginning of 2016, it had raised £98 million, £40 million of which will be used to renovate the Marylebone Town Hall, with £28 million for research, £18 million in scholarships for students, £10 million to increase the school&#x27;s endowment, and £4 million to improve technology across the school. By June 2016, the school had raised £125 million, including two £25 million gifts from alumni Jim Ratcliffe and Idan Ofer.

François Ortalo-Magné, the French-born former Dean of the Wisconsin School of Business, succeeded Sir Andrew Likierman as Dean in August 2017. In January 2024, it was announced that the Russian economist Sergei Guriev, previously the provost of the Institut d’études politiques in Paris (Sciences Po) would take over from Ortalo-Magné at the beginning of the 2024/2025 academic year, also joining the university&#x27;s faculty as a professor of Economics. Guriev took up his post on 1 August 2024. 

==Campus==
The campus is at Sussex Place in Marylebone, on the perimeter of Regent&#x27;s Park.

The business school has redeveloped the Marylebone Town Hall into classrooms and offices at the Sammy Ofer Centre. It will further expand it in 2020 (see above).

== Academics ==
=== Master in Business Administration (MBA) ===
The school&#x27;s flagship programme is its full-time 15–21-month Master of Business Administration degree. MBA students take a prescribed set of core courses then choose from roughly 70 different electives. Class size has been around 400 students in every annual cohort. These are broken into 5 streams of approximately 80 students who take all core courses together. 

Beyond academics, the school puts an emphasis on personal and professional development including leadership, global awareness, and business skill building. These developments are facilitated via specialized workshops led by external consultants, students, and faculty. In addition to a range of elective courses at the London Business School, the school has partnerships with around 32 exchange schools around the world. Each academic year around 100 students spend a term at another leading business school.

The MBA Programme has one of the world&#x27;s largest international exchange programmes. Each year approximately 35 per cent of second-year MBAs spend a term abroad at one of over 30 partner schools, including NYU Stern School of Business, IESE Business School, Booth School of Business of The University of Chicago, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA Anderson School of Management, the MIT Sloan School of Management, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College, Columbia Business School, Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, Indian School of Business among others.

=== Executive MBA ===
The school offers four Executive (part-time) MBA degrees, which are completed in 16–20 months. At an academic level, the school offers the same degree to both Executive (part-time) and full-time MBA students. The programmes involve very similar core courses to the full-time MBA, international field work and a wide range of elective courses. The course ends with a capstone together with company project or management report.
* Executive MBA (London).
* Executive MBA (Dubai). The programme begins with an orientation week in London. Following this, students take 10 core modules, which are taught in a four- or five-day block each month in Dubai. Students then undertake electives, which are primarily offered in London, and an international assignment. Two additional core modules take place in London. 
* EMBA-Global Americas and Europe. A further 140 executives are enrolled in the dual-degree EMBA-Global Programme. It is taught in partnership with Columbia Business School. Graduates are awarded degrees from both universities. The first year involves week-long modules each month alternating between London and New York. In the second year, students select from the full range of electives available at the participating schools.
* EMBA-Global Asia. launched in 2008 jointly with Hong Kong University and Columbia. Teaching takes place at all three business schools. While the first year is modelled on the transatlantic EMBA-Global, the school states that because &quot;EMBA-Global Asia is designed for people who have or will have significant trans-national responsibilities, all courses reflect a greater proportion of global material&quot;.

=== Masters in Finance ===

<text>Kurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister (13 October 1893 – 8 July 1971) was a mathematician born in Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany.

==Life==

He was a brother of Marie Neurath.
Beginning in 1912, he studied in Freiburg, Munich, Marburg, and Göttingen. In 1920, he got the (master&#x27;s degree) in mathematics, philosophy, physics, chemistry, and geology.
He received his doctorate in 1921 with a thesis in algebraic number theory at the University of Hamburg under the supervision of Erich Hecke.

He became interested in differential geometry; he edited Wilhelm Blaschke&#x27;s second volume on the topic, and both made an acclaimed contribution to the Jena DMV conference in September 1921.

In October 1922 or 1923 he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Vienna. While there he became familiar with the work of Wilhelm Wirtinger on knot theory, and became closely connected to Hans Hahn and the Vienna Circle. Its 1929 manifesto lists one of Reidemeister&#x27;s publications in a bibliography of closely related authors.

In 1925 he became a full professor at the University of Königsberg; he stayed until 1933, when he was regarded politically unsound by the Nazis and dismissed from his position. Whilst there he organised the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences in conjunction with journal &quot;Erkenntnis&quot;.

Blaschke managed to get a promise about Reidemeister&#x27;s reappointment, and in autumn 1934 he got the chair of Kurt Hensel at the University of Marburg. He stayed there, except for a visit to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study in 1948–1950, until he got appointed to Göttingen University in 1955, where he stayed until his emeritation.

==Works==
Reidemeister&#x27;s interests were mainly in combinatorial group theory, combinatorial topology, geometric group theory, and the foundations of geometry. His works include &quot;Knoten und Gruppen&quot; (1926), &quot;Einführung in die kombinatorische Topologie&quot; (1932), and &quot;Knotentheorie&quot; (1932). He co-edited the journal &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; from 1947 until 1963.
He was also a philosopher. His book &quot;Das exakte Denken der Griechen&quot; (1949) is not as well known as his mathematical work. In it he remarks that mathematical thought is &quot;just the beginning of thought&quot;.

<text>New Albion, also known as Nova Albion (in reference to an archaic name for Britain), was the name of the continental area north of Mexico claimed by Sir Francis Drake for England when he landed on the North American west coast in 1579. This claim became the justification for English charters across America to the Atlantic coast and soon influenced further national expansion projects on the continent. Drake&#x27;s landing site has been identified as Drake&#x27;s Cove, which is part of Point Reyes National Seashore.

Drake, after successfully sacking Spanish towns and plundering Spanish ships along their eastern Pacific coast colonies, sought safe harbour to prepare his ship, &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, for circumnavigation back to England. He found it on 17 June 1579, when he and his crew landed on the Pacific coast at Drakes Bay in Northern California. While encamped there, he had friendly relations with the Coast Miwok people who inhabited the area near his landing. Naming the area &quot;Nova Albion&quot;, or New Albion, he claimed sovereignty of the area for Queen Elizabeth I, an act which would have significant long-term historical consequences. Sailing away on 23 July and leaving behind no colony, Drake eventually circumnavigated the globe and returned to England in September 1580.

Over the years, numerous speculative sites along the North American Pacific coast were investigated as the area of Drake&#x27;s New Albion claim. Through the following centuries, various cartographers and mariners identified the area near Point Reyes as Drake&#x27;s likely landing place. In the 20th and 21st centuries, definitive evidence was gathered, particularly regarding Drake&#x27;s contact with the Coast Miwok people and porcelain shards which were established to be remnants of Drake&#x27;s cargo. The various avenues of research led to a National Historic Landmark designation by the United States Department of the Interior in October 2012 and a California Historical Landmark designation by California State Parks in October 2021.

==Drake&#x27;s voyage==
===Background===
In the late 1500s, a cold war existed between England and Spain—one which involved religious differences, economic pressure, and emerging navigational and colonisation desires. As part of this, Sir Francis Drake developed a plan to plunder Spanish colonial settlements on the Pacific Coast of the New World. Gathering several investors, and likely with the backing of Queen Elizabeth I—which may have been in the form of a secret commission as a privateer—Drake embarked upon the voyage on 15 November 1577. Even though Drake&#x27;s actions would damage England&#x27;s relations with Spain&#x27;s King Philip II, Drake understood he could rely upon Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s support.

After successfully taking considerable amounts of treasure from Spanish towns and ships along King Philip&#x27;s eastern Pacific coast colonies, Drake sailed north to seek a shortcut back to England via the hypothetical Strait of Anián, a supposedly navigable shortcut connecting the Pacific and Atlantic. The strait, a fanciful idea similar to the Fountain of Youth, was speculated to exist at about 40 degrees north. Although Drake may have possibly reached a latitude as high as 48 degrees, his northward progress was ultimately stopped by foul weather in the northeast trade winds belt. Upon failing to locate the strait, Drake sought safe harbour to ready his ship, &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, before attempting a circumnavigation of the globe to return home.

===Drake&#x27;s coastal exploration and claim===
Prior to Drake&#x27;s voyage, the western coast of North America had only been partially explored in 1542 by Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, who sailed for Spain. So, intending to avoid further conflict with Spain, Drake navigated northwest of the Spanish presence. By navigating well beyond where Cabrillo had asserted a Spanish claim, Drake sought to locate a discreet site at which the crew could prepare for the journey back to England.

On 5 June 1579, the ship briefly made first landfall at South Cove, Cape Arago, just south of Coos Bay, Oregon. From there, Drake sailed south while searching for a suitable harbour to repair his ailing ship. On 17 June, Drake and his crew found a protected cove when they landed on the Pacific coast of what is now Northern California. While ashore, he claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I as &quot;Nova Albion&quot; or New Albion, choosing this name for two reasons: first, the white banks and cliffs which he saw were similar to those found on the English coast and, second, because &quot;Albion&quot; was an archaic name by which the island of Great Britain was known. To document and assert his claim, Drake had an engraved plate of brass, one which contained a sixpence bearing Elizabeth&#x27;s image, attached to a large post. Giving details of Drake&#x27;s visit, it claimed sovereignty for Elizabeth and every successive English monarch.

After erecting a fort and tents ashore, the crew laboured for several weeks as they prepared for the circumnavigating voyage ahead by careening their ship, &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, so to effectively clean and repair the hull. Drake had friendly interactions with the Coast Miwok and explored the surrounding land by foot when crossing Inverness Ridge to visit a village and explore the country. When his ship was ready for the return voyage, Drake and the crew left New Albion on 23 July and paused his journey the next day when anchoring his ship at the Farallon Islands where the crew hunted seal meat. On 25 July, they sailed west to continue their Pacific crossing, and &quot;Golden Hind&quot; finally returned to England in September 1580.

===English response===
Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation began a period of British maritime dominance that lasted until the 20th century, and as a result of his successful deeds against Spain, Drake was admired and celebrated by many in England. According to John Stow, Drake&#x27;s &quot;name and fame became admirable in all places, the people swarming daily in the streets to behold him, vowing hatred of all that durst mislike him.&quot; Not only were his investors and the queen richly rewarded, Drake was also allowed to keep £24,000 of the purloined treasure for himself and his crew. Drake quickly became a favorite at the queen&#x27;s court and was knighted by the French ambassador on her behalf.
To allow for disinformation and create an illusory threat that Drake had discovered a short route from the Pacific to Europe, details of the voyage were initially suppressed; Drake&#x27;s sailors were pledged not to disclose their route under threat of death. Upon his return, Drake handed over his log and a large map to the queen. While the other items disappeared, the map, known as the Queen&#x27;s Map, remained on limited view for a number of years. Finally, it too was lost in the Whitehall Palace fire of 1698. However, around 1590 Jodocus Hondius composed a derivative of this map, known as &quot;Vera Totius Expeditionis Navticae&quot;. This map shows Drake&#x27;s journey and includes an inset of the harbor at &quot;Nova Albion&quot;. In 1589, further details emerged when an official account of Drake&#x27;s circumnavigating voyage by Richard Hakluyt was published. In 1628, Drake&#x27;s nephew and namesake, Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet, published &quot;The World Encompassed&quot;. This comprehensive account of the voyage, which is based on the notes of Drake&#x27;s chaplain Francis Fletcher, includes numerous details of New Albion and is the most extensive account of Drake&#x27;s voyage.

Because the extent of Drake&#x27;s New Albion was vague—essentially a classification of the territory north and west of Spanish territory—the designated location differs among maps. After Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1603, maps began to depict the area of North America above Mexico as &quot;Nova Albion&quot;. Drake&#x27;s claim of land on the Pacific coast for England became a basis which influenced subsequent colonial charters issued by English monarchs that purported to grant lands from sea to sea, the area from the Atlantic where English colonies were first established all the way to the Pacific. Along with Martin Frobisher&#x27;s claims in Greenland and Baffin Island and Humphrey Gilbert&#x27;s 1583 claim of Newfoundland, New Albion was one of the earliest English territorial claims in the New World. These claims were eventually followed by settlement of the Roanoke Colony in 1584, and Jamestown in 1607.

==The people and the land==
By using detailed descriptions of the people encountered by Drake—particularly their houses, feathered baskets, ceremonies, and language—anthropologists have clearly identified the people as Coast Miwok, a people whose traditional homeland included the Point Reyes area in what is now present day Marin County, California.

When Drake landed his crew, the Coast Miwok people initially approached his encampment while armed with bows and arrows, uncertainly cautious regarding the newcomers. But Drake quickly allayed their suspicions, and multitudes of unarmed Miwok soon visited his encampment on a daily basis. In their early encounters with the Coast Miwok, Drake&#x27;s crew observed as the Miwok wailed and engaged in self-laceration. Drake misinterpreted this response as an act of worship and concluded that the people believed him and his crew to be gods; however, this Miwok custom was actually one of mourning. Most likely the Miwok regarded the English visitors as relatives who had returned from the dead.

In a particularly significant gesture, one day a large assembly of Coast Miwok descended on the encampment and honored Drake by placing chains around his neck, a sceptre in his hand, and a crown of feathers on his head as if he were being proclaimed king. Upon this uncertain, seemingly voluntary surrender of sovereignty by its owners, England based its presumed legal authority to the territory.

After gaining the Coast Miwoks&#x27; trust, Drake journeyed to explore the inland area and visit their villages. Accompanied by crew members, Drake trekked on a Coast Miwok trail to traverse the Inverness Ridge and descend into what is now the Olema Valley. Fletcher described the village structures there as round subterranean buildings which came together at the top like spires on a steeple. Fletcher also described the Coast Miwok baskets as water-tight, shaped like a deep bowl, and covered with a matted layer of colored feathers. Such baskets were made only by the Coast Miwok, Pomo, Lake Miwok, Patwin, and Wappo peoples who were all concentrated near Drake&#x27;s landing site. 

Additionally, Fletcher was the first person to make a written record of any of the 64 distinct language groups in prehistoric California, namely five specific Coast Miwok words: &quot;Hioh&quot;, &quot;Gnaah&quot;, &quot;Huchee kecharo&quot;, &quot;Nacharo mu&quot;, and &quot;Cheepe&quot;. These words noted by Fletcher are from a distinct language group, and Heizer wrote that they were unquestionably of Coast Miwok derivation, linguistic proof of Drake&#x27;s contact with the Coast Miwok. Overall, the relations between the Coast Miwok and their visitors were peaceful and friendly, and the Miwok seemed to exhibit distress when &quot;Golden Hind&quot; sailed away.

Fletcher also recorded climate information and characterised the unpleasant summer weather conditions of the area near the careenage basin. He noted the continuous nipping chill; lack of sun; and cold, sometimes violent, winds. In contrast, across the Inverness Ridge, he found a distinct climate variance and experienced a flourishing land. Fletcher assessed the area: &quot;The inland we found to be farre different from the shoare, a goodly country and fruitful soyle, stored with many blessings fit for the use of man&quot;.

Fletcher also chronicled his observation of certain animals unknown to the English and described them as &quot;very large and fat Deere&quot; and &quot;a multitude of a strange kinde of Conies.&quot; The &quot;fat Deere&quot; were most likely Roosevelt Elk, and the conies are identified as gophers. These and the rest of Fletcher&#x27;s assessments and observations of New Albion are flawlessly in concert with the geography of Point Reyes.

==Historical influence==
The New Albion claim had far-reaching historical consequences. Even though Drake attempted no long-term presence and the English made no immediate follow-up to the claim, it constituted England&#x27;s first assertion of sovereignty on the North American Pacific coast. And since all of their subsequent expeditions along the North American Pacific coast were infrequent and irregular, Nova Albion was primarily a geographical designation—a new, distinctive name on the world map. Ultimately, this designation was significant because it proclaimed England&#x27;s ability—and presumed right—to establish an empire in the Americas. Consequently, Drake&#x27;s New Albion claim was a forward-thinking, considered component of a new national expansion policy, one of several of his exploits which both determined Elizabeth&#x27;s policy for the duration of her reign and indirectly influenced England&#x27;s continuing historical future.

The New Albion claim was the first indication of English goals broader than simple reprisal against Spain which then influenced similar national expansion projects by others such as Humphrey Gilbert and Walter Raleigh. As a rejection of territorial claims based on papal authority, the New Albion claim asserted Elizabeth&#x27;s notion of territorial claims via physical presence as opposed to a Papal mandate. This promoted the idea of New Albion as &quot;the back side of Virginia,&quot; an expression of England&#x27;s presumed legal status of sea-to-sea entitlement. The claim occupied a significant place in British geopolitical considerations for centuries and even strengthened Britain&#x27;s entitlement to the fur trade commerce along the Northwest Coast. Its final influential assertion came in negotiating the Oregon Treaty of 1846 which divided the Oregon Country between Canada and the United States, with the border being along the 49th parallel north to the Pacific.

Until the 19th century, many English maps referred to New Albion as encompassing all of Upper California, whereas &#x27;California&#x27; proper was reduced to the Baja peninsula. This amplifies the suspicion that the English had, although unofficially, somewhat vague claims over Upper California before its annexation by the United States in 1848.

==Site recognition and identification==

===Early identifications===

Beginning in the 17th century, maps identify Drakes Bay as Drake&#x27;s landing site. In 1793, George Vancouver studied the site, and concluded it was in Drakes Bay. Professor George Davidson, of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, after a study of the narrative and the coast, identified the harbour entered by Drake as Drakes Bay, at Point Reyes, about north of San Francisco. &quot;Drakes Bay,&quot; he reported in 1886, &quot;is a capital harbor in northwest winds, such as Drake encountered. It is easily entered, sheltered by high lands, and a vessel may anchor in three fathoms, close under the shore in good holding ground.&quot; Davidson published further support for the Drakes Bay location in 1890 and 1908.

===20th century identifications===
In 1947, following up on work by archaeologists A. L. Kroeber and William W. Elemendorf, archaeologist Robert F. Heizer analyzed the ethnographic reports of Drake&#x27;s stay at New Albion. Confirming their work Heizer states that &quot;Drake must have landed in territory occupied by the Coast Miwok-speaking natives.&quot; In his full analysis, Heizer concludes, &quot;in June 1579, then, Drake probably landed in what is now known as Drake&#x27;s Bay.&quot;
Since 1949, the theory that Drake landed at Drakes Bay has been advocated for by the Drake Navigators Guild in California, and by former president Captain Adolph S. Oko, Jr., former honorary chairman Chester W. Nimitz, and former president Raymond Aker. Oko wrote, &quot;Many other correlative facts have been ... found true to the Drake&#x27;s Cove site as part of the &quot;total body of evidence&quot;. The weight of evidence truly establishes Drake&#x27;s Cove as the nodal point of Nova Albion.&quot; Nimitz stated that he did &quot;not doubt that in time the public will come to recognize the importance and value of this long-lost site, and will rank it with other National Historic Sites such as Roanoke, Jamestown, and Plymouth.&quot; In 1956, Sir Alex A. Cumming, who was the curator of Buckland Abbey, Drake&#x27;s past home and current museum, also recognised Drake&#x27;s landing: &quot;That little cove at the mouth of the Estero, sheltered from the wind, protected from the sea and hidden from hostile eyes, must have been a welcome sight, and I believe that Divine Providence guided him to it.&quot; In 1978, two time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that &quot;Drakes Bay is correctly so named, that here he spent five weeks, repaired the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, sang songs for the Indians, and marched up country.&quot; 

Aker conducted detailed studies reconstructing Drake&#x27;s circumnavigating voyage and advocated for the site at Point Reyes, citing the fact that the official published account placed the colony at 38 degrees north. The geography of Drake&#x27;s Cove, which lies along the coast of Marin County, has often been suggested as being similar to the cove described by Drake, including the white cliffs that look like the south coast of England and the specific configuration of the Cove. Responding to questions about the geographical fit of the cove, Aker maintained that criticisms—those based on the inconsistent configuration of the sandbars in the cove—were unfounded. He maintained that the configuration of the sandbars in the cove was cyclic over the decades. Accordingly, Aker effectively answered the questions when he predicted that a spit of land that disappeared in 1956—one which closely resembles one on the Hondius map—would reappear. Aker&#x27;s assertions were confirmed when the spit formed again in 2001.

Artefactual evidence emerged when nearly one hundred pieces of 16th century Chinese export porcelain wares were found in the vicinity of the Drake&#x27;s Cove site which, according to Clarence Shangraw of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and archaeologist Edward Von der Porten, &quot;must fairly be attributed to Francis Drake&#x27;s &quot;Golden Hind&quot; visit of 1579.&quot; These ceramic samples, found at Point Reyes, are the earliest datable archaeological specimens of Chinese porcelains transported across the Pacific in Manila galleons. The artefacts were found by four different agencies beginning with the University of California, the Drake Navigators Guild, then the Santa Rosa Junior College, and finally San Francisco State College. These porcelain shards are the remains of porcelain dishes Drake took from a Spanish treasure ship in the Pacific. Off-loaded during the careening process and abandoned when Drake sailed from Point Reyes, the porcelain wares were the heaviest items of unknown value that he carried.

The porcelains were first identified by Shangraw and then later by Von der Porten. These researchers specifically distinguished the Drake porcelains, which were found in middens associated with the Coast Miwok, from those of Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño&#x27;s &quot;San Agustin&quot;, the 1595 Manila galleon shipwreck which rests at the floor of Drakes Bay. Unlike the Drake porcelains, shards from the &quot;San Augustin&quot; wreck had washed onto the Point Reyes shore from the sunken ship&#x27;s broken structure. Shangraw and Von der Porten were able to differentiate the two cargoes by using such criteria as design, style, quality, and surface wear. The Drake porcelains have clean breaks and show no abrasion from the tumbling action of the surf. In contrast, the Cermeño shards display surf-tumbling, distinct designs, and differences in style and quality—all which suggests two separate cargoes. Drake&#x27;s purloined cargo included fine porcelain Jingdezhen ware dishes from Jingdezhen, the industrial centre of top quality Chinese porcelain. However, the &quot;San Agustin&#x27;s&quot; cargo carried poor quality porcelain wares which were made later by south coast entrepreneurs who were quickly capitalising on a rapidly developing, lucrative market. The &quot;San Agustin&quot; cargo included pieces from kilns which only began production in about 1590. All of these factors allowed the cargoes to be convincingly distinguished.

===21st century identifications===
Examining the Drake landing site from a nautical perspective, Sir Simon Cassels, Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel, Royal Navy, concluded in 2003 that &quot;the weight of evidence... bears heavily on only one and the same site for careening the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;: the estuary within what for more than 100 years has been named Drakes Bay.&quot;

Engaging in scientific research on the Drake and Cermeño sherds by using X-ray fluorescence, Dr. Marco Meniketti of San Jose State University tested ceramics from shipwrecks in Mexico, California, and Oregon as well as porcelains linked to Drake found near Point Reyes. Using varied shipwreck sources to provide strong controls to the research, Meniketti&#x27;s findings support the conclusion that the Cermeño porcelains and the Drake ceramics are from two different ships. He states that these two cargoes can be distinguished based on differences in their key elements and believes these differences may represent changes in glaze chemistry, clay sources, or unique inclusions or tempering. Aker maintained that those porcelain sherds that washed onto shore must be attributed to Cermeño, and those with clean breaks and no water wear must be attributed to Drake.

Historian Dr. John Sugden, after reviewing numerous proposed Drake landing sites, observed, &quot;No aspect of Drake&#x27;s career has suffered more false leads than the site of Nova Albion.&quot; Sugden concludes that &quot;the evidence overwhelmingly favours Drake&#x27;s Estero in Drakes Bay&quot; and that &quot;it is high time the United States register of National Historic Landmarks officially recognized Drake&#x27;s Estero as the Elizabethan anchorage.&quot;

===Official recognition===
The site of Drake&#x27;s landing as officially recognised by the U.S. Department of the Interior and other agencies is Drake&#x27;s Cove. The cove is located in Drakes Estero which trends northerly off Drakes Bay. The site lies in Marin County, California, near Point Reyes, just north of the Golden Gate, at . On 16 October 2012, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar signed the nomination and on 17 October 2012, the Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District was formally announced as a new National Historic Landmark. The marker was placed at . One report referred to the site as the most likely site for Drake&#x27;s landing. No Drake anchorage has endured so much scrutiny nor seen the amount of field study and research as has this location.

This distinction endorses the district&#x27;s artefactual evidence as of one of the earliest instances of interaction between native people and European explorers on the west coast of the current United States of America. This distinction is based on two historical encounters: Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s 1579 California landing and &quot;Golden Hind&quot; anchorage and Sebastian Rodriguez Cermeño&#x27;s landing and &quot;San Agustin&quot;, his 1595 Manila galleon shipwreck.

In October 2021, the California State Parks Director Armando Quintero designated Site of New Albion as California Historical Landmark number 1061. The 215 acre location, identified as Drake&#x27;s Cove, is all within the boundaries of Point Reyes National Seashore. The state&#x27;s Office of Historic Preservation states, &quot;New Albion is the landing site and encampment of Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s expedition to California in 1579, located in the coast of Marin County,&quot; and specifies several notable events associated with the landmark: “Includes sites of Drake&#x27;s fort, the careening of the &quot;Golden Hind&quot;, the abandonment of Tello&#x27;s bark, and the meetings with the Coast Miwok peoples.

That the Coast Miwok people&#x27;s first contact with Europeans was with Sir Francis Drake is also recognised by the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, a federation of Coast Miwok and Southern Pomo people which has been officially sanctioned by the United States Congress. Additionally, the Coast Miwok Tribal Council of Marin—organized under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975—acknowledges the 1579 contact with Drake by their lineal ancestors, the Indigenous Marin Coast Miwok people.

Both the Oregon State Parks and Oregon Historical Society support that Drake anchored at Cape Arago and then sailed south to seek a suitable careenage site for &quot;Golden Hind&quot;.

===Ideas suggesting alternative locations===
Considering that in excess of thirty other locations have been advanced as the site of Drake&#x27;s port, more information has been printed regarding the location of New Albion than any other New World harbour that Drake sought. Davidson recognises an abundance of confusion from armchair historians, including Samuel Johnson and Jules Verne, and attributes the confusion to their lack of seamanship experience and navigational knowledge.

One such location is San Francisco Bay, California. Robert H. Power, co-owner of the Nut Tree in Vacaville, California, promoted the idea that Drake&#x27;s New Albion was inside present day San Francisco Bay, specifically near Point San Quentin Among his arguments was that the Hondius Broadside map matched a part of the topography when parts were adjusted using a 2:1 correction.

In 2003 Canadian R. Samuel Bawlf suggested that Drake&#x27;s landing was on present day Vancouver Island at Comox, British Columbia Bawlf supported the idea that Drake careened &quot;Golden Hind&quot; in Whale Cove, Oregon, and he pointed to a number of pieces of evidence in support of his view that the official published record of Drake&#x27;s voyage was deliberately altered to suppress the true extent of his discoveries.

==Speculation of a colony==

A counting discrepancy of &quot;Golden Hind&quot; crew members has led to speculation that Drake left behind men to form a colony. The idea that Drake formed a colony is, however, suspect—it is improbable that Drake would have left settlers at New Albion since he had not equipped the voyage for colonization. Drake was also undoubtedly aware that England would have trouble enforcing its claim by supporting a nascent colony in a land so remote as New Albion and would have likely avoided planting such an English outpost. Additionally, the only person specifically reported as left behind at New Albion was N. de Morena, a European ship pilot who was in ill health. Spanish sources state that he was left ashore, recovered his health, and eventually embarked on a successful four-year journey by walking to Mexico, where he reported to authorities.

The counting discrepancy, a difference of at least 20 men, concerns the number of crew Drake commanded before his stay in Northern California as compared to crew tallies when he reached the Moluccas, an archipelago in the Banda Sea, Indonesia. Released Spanish prisoners stated that, off the coast of Central America, the ship&#x27;s company was about 80 men. Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s cousin and crew member, John Drake, claimed the number totaled 60 when the ship was at Ternate in the Moluccas. On Vesuvius Reef, &quot;The World Encompassed&quot; puts the number at 58. All notions of an embryo colony are primarily based on these numbers, and the reason for this discrepancy remains unknown.

==Plate of Brass hoax==
In the 1900s, a hoax was perpetrated regarding the brass plate which Drake had posted at New Albion. English historian Richard Hakluyt wrote details of the distinctive original plate:
The original plate—which served as tangible notice of England&#x27;s sovereignty over the land—has yet to be found. Consequently, the exact location of the monument erected by Drake is unknown.

In 1936, a counterfeit, known as Drake&#x27;s Plate of Brass, came to public attention, and for decades its discovery was widely believed to be that of the original. While it was accepted as authentic by the University of California, Berkeley, doubts persisted. Eventually, in the late 1970s, metallurgical tests showed that this supposed original plate could not have been made in the 1500s, and scientists determined that the plate was a modern creation. In 2003, it was publicly revealed that the counterfeit plate was created as a practical joke among local historians. Spinning out of control, the joke unintentionally became a public hoax and embarrassment to those who had once confirmed its authenticity.

<text>The positivity effect is the ability to constructively analyze a situation where the desired results are not achieved, but still obtain positive feedback that assists one&#x27;s future progression.

Empirical research findings suggest that the positivity effect can be influenced by internal positive speech, where engaging in constructive self-dialogue can significantly improve one’s ability to perceive and react to challenging situations more optimistically.

The findings of a study show that the optimism bias in future-oriented thinking fulfils a self-improvement purpose while also suggesting this bias probably reflects a common underpinning motivational process across various future-thinking domains, either episodic or semantic.

== In attribution==
The positivity effect as an attribution phenomenon relates to the habits and characteristics of people when evaluating the causes of their behaviors. To positively attribute is to be open to attributing a person’s inherent disposition as the cause of their positive behaviors, and the situations surrounding them as the potential cause of their negative behaviors.

== In perception ==
Two studies by Emilio Ferrara have shown that, on online social networks like Twitter and Instagram, users prefer to share positive news, and are emotionally affected by positive news more than twice as much as they are by negative news.

<doc id="520197" wikidata="Q1759502" url="?curid=520197" title="Luing">
<text>Luing ( ; ) is one of the Slate Islands, Firth of Lorn, in the west of Argyll in Scotland, about south of Oban. The island has an area of and is bounded by several small skerries and islets. It has a population of around 200 people, mostly living in Cullipool, Toberonochy (&quot;Tobar Dhonnchaidh&quot;), and Blackmillbay.

== Geology ==
The larger part of the bedrock of Luing is provided by the Neoproterozoic age Easdale Slate Formation, a pyritic, graphitic pelite belonging to the Easdale Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Thin bands of quartzite are also present. Zones of metamorphosed intrusive igneous rocks occur within the northeast of the island. Luing is cut by NE-SW aligned Siluro-Devonian felsite dykes and by numerous later NW-SE aligned basalt and microgabbro dykes which form a part of the ‘Mull Swarm’ which is of early Palaeogene age.
Raised marine deposits of sand and gravel occur widely around the margins of the island, a legacy of late Quaternary changes in relative sea-level.

==Economy and culture==
A regular ferry service crosses the Cuan Sound which separates Luing from the neighbouring island of Seil, which is in turn connected by bridge to the mainland.

The main industries on Luing are tourism, lobster fishing and beef farming, although slate quarrying was important until 1965, with quarries at Toberonochy, Cullipool, and a smaller one at Port Mary. Slate from Luing was used in the construction of the University of Glasgow and re-roofing of Iona Abbey.

For such a small island, Luing has produced numerous mòd gold medallists: Nan MacInnes (1926, in Oban), Sandy Brown (1938, in Glasgow) and Hughie MacQueen (1985, in Lochaber).

Luing cattle were first developed here, as a commercial beef breed hardy enough to prosper under adverse weather. They are a breed of red beef cattle, produced by the Cadzow family in 1947 from a cross between Beef Shorthorn and Highland cattle.
==Etymology==
According to Haswell-Smith (2004) the name &quot;Luing&quot; may derive from the Old Norse &quot;lyng&quot;, meaning &quot;heather&quot; or &quot;long&quot; meaning ship. However, Mac an Tàilleir (2003) states &quot;this is probably a pre-Gaelic name of unclear meaning.&quot;

==History==

In the early part of the Christian era Luing would have formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada. From the 9th to 13th centuries almost all of the Hebrides came under the control of Norse settlers and formed part of the Kingdom of the Isles. However, when Edgar of Scotland signed a treaty with Magnus Barefoot in 1098, formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up Scottish claims to the Hebrides and Kintyre, Luing and Lismore were retained by the Scots.

The graveyard at the ruined church of Kilchattan documents the lives of past islanders, with quarriers, sailors and crofters side by side. Gravestones of note include those of Covenanter Alexander Campbell.

<doc id="520203" wikidata="Q2837461" url="?curid=520203" title="All Along">
<text>All Along (7 April 1979 – 23 February 2005) was a champion Thoroughbred mare that was foaled and trained in France. She was one of the top European fillies since World War II. While she mostly raced in Europe, the filly also won top-level races in North America. She was named into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2019. All Along was less successful as a broodmare, her only winning offspring being the Mill Reef-sired colt Along All who won the Prix Greffulhe in 1989.

==Background==
A granddaughter of Round Table, she was owned by Daniel Wildenstein (1917–2001), the French art dealer. All Along was trained in France, first by Maurice Zilber (1981) and for the remainder of her career by Patrick-Louis Biancone.

==Racing career==

===1981: Two-year-old season===
As a two-year-old, the filly raced only one time and won.

===1982: Three-year-old season===
The following year, she competed on turf courses in France, England and Japan, winning numerous prestigious races.

===1983: Four-year-old season===
In 1983 All Along finished third to Zalataia in the Grand Prix de Chantilly but then finished seventh of the nine runners when favourite for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. After a summer break she returned for the Prix Foy at Longchamp Racecourse. Biancone decided to change the tactics used on the filly and instructed her jockey to hold up the filly for a late run. She made up a great deal of ground in the closing stages to finish second, a length behind the British-trained filly Time Charter.

Ridden by jockey Walter Swinburn, All Along started at odds of 17.3/1 France&#x27;s most famous race, the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. She was held up until the straight when she was produced with a strong run along the rail, catching the leader Sun Princess in the last 100 metres and winning by a length. Luth Enchantee beat Time Charter in a photograph for third, meaning that fillies filled the first four places. She was immediately shipped to Toronto, Ontario, Canada and won the Rothmans International at Woodbine Racetrack. Two weeks later, she won the Turf Classic at Aqueduct Racetrack in Jamaica, New York by 8¾ lengths, then won the Washington, D.C. International Stakes at Laurel, Maryland. Four consecutive wins against the best horses in the world all occurred within 41 days. She was the first horse to win the three prestigious North American races in a row, netting a million-dollar bonus for her owners and Horse of the Year honors in both France and the United States.

She was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Female Turf Horse and became the first filly to win the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year since the voting system had been implemented in the 1970s.

===1984: Five-year-old season===
In 1984, she competed in only four races, including a close second in the inaugural Breeders&#x27; Cup Turf.

==Stud record==
All Along retired as a broodmare to the Three Chimneys Farm in Midway, Kentucky. 
She was the dam of:
* 1998 bay filly, Armure Royale by Woodman
* 1993 filly, Arutua by Riverman
* 1988 filly, All Dancing by Dancing Brave

She died in 2005 and was buried in the cemetery at the Old Bradley Place division of Three Chimneys Farm.

==Assessment==
All Along was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1990 and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2019. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, All Along was ranked #68.
* All Along was inbred 4 × 4 to the stallion Prince Rose, meaning that the latter appears twice in the fourth generation of her pedigree.

<doc id="520204" wikidata="Q1473304" url="?curid=520204" title="Rootes Arrow">
<text>Rootes Arrow was the manufacturer&#x27;s name for a range of cars produced under several badge-engineered marques by the Rootes Group (later Chrysler Europe) from 1966 to 1979 in Europe, and continuing on until 2005 in Iran. It is amongst the last Rootes designs, developed with no influence from future owner Chrysler. The range is almost always referred to by the name of the most prolific model, the Hillman Hunter.

A substantial number of separate marque and model names were applied to this single car platform. Some were given different model names to justify trim differences (Hillman GT, Hillman Estate Car) and, from time to time, models were sold in some European markets under the Sunbeam marque (Sunbeam Sceptre for instance), and at other times used UK marque/model names. Singer Gazelle and Vogue models were also sold in the UK for one season badged as Sunbeams after the Singer brand was withdrawn.

The models sold – not all concurrently – were, alphabetically by marque:
* Chrysler Hunter, Chrysler Vogue
* Dodge Husky
* Hillman Arrow, Hillman Break de Chasse, Hillman Estate Car, Hillman GT, Hillman Hunter, Hillman Hustler, Hillman Minx, Hillman Vogue
* Humber Sceptre
* Iran National Paykan
* Singer Gazelle and Singer Vogue
* Sunbeam Alpine and Sunbeam Rapier fastback coupés
* Sunbeam Arrow, Sunbeam Break de Chasse, Sunbeam Hunter, Sunbeam Minx, Sunbeam Sceptre, and Sunbeam Vogue

The most prolific model within the Arrow range, the Hillman Hunter, was the Coventry-based company&#x27;s major competitor in the small family car segment. In its 13-year production run, its UK market contemporaries included the Ford Cortina, Vauxhall Victor, Austin/Morris 1800, and Morris Marina. The sports-orientated Sunbeam Rapier occupied a segment contested by the Ford Capri, MGB GT, Vauxhall Firenza, and to an extent the Triumph Dolomite, while the more upmarket Humber Sceptre competed with other premium-specification cars based on conventional saloons, such as the Vanden Plas 1300 and 1500, the Wolseley 18/85, and the Ford Cortina 1600E and 2000E.

The Arrow range extended to several body styles: saloon, estate, fastback coupé and a two different coupe utilities (pick-ups) (the Dodge Husky from South Africa and the Paykan Pick-Up in Iran, each model had a unique body). Depending on the model, they had two doors or four doors. Not all marques were represented in all body styles, with the coupés being reserved for Sunbeam.

==Development==
The Arrow range was conceived in 1962. Following the Hillman Imp, consideration was given to developing a larger rear-engined car, but this concept was dismissed, and the engineering settled on for the new car was more conventional and closer to the layout of the existing Audax series (which included the previous Hillman Minx).

With cash-strapped Rootes struggling amid continuing engine cooling problems with the Imp, which often resulted in warped cylinder heads, the cautious Arrow broke little new engineering ground. New parts were largely based on tried and tested Rootes components, using a new but strong 5-bearing version of the well-proven 1725 cc overhead valve petrol engine as a starting point which varied in output from (in the Humber Sceptre). The engine was inclined by a modest 15 degrees, to allow for a lower bonnet line and to enable packaging of the carburettors. This engine was further uprated by specialists Holbay, employing two Weber 40DCOE carburettors to produce for the Sunbeam Rapier H120 and Hillman Hunter GLS. A smaller 1500 cc engine was the standard for manual versions of the Hillman Minx and the Singer Gazelle, and the Hillman Hunter DeLuxe model which succeeded the Minx. Automatic models were all powered by the 1725 cc engine. Particular attention was paid to weight and cost to bring the vehicle in line with its natural competitors, including the Mark 2 Ford Cortina.

For the first time in a Rootes car MacPherson strut suspension featured at the front, with a conventional live axle mounted on leaf springs at the rear. Other firsts for Rootes in the new car were curved side glass and flow-through ventilation.

Manual transmissions were available in four-speed form with an optional Laycock de Normanville overdrive, or Borg-Warner automatic transmission, again as an option. Initially, the Borg Warner Type 35 3-speed automatic was offered, then the Type 45 four-speed automatic became available in 1973.

The handbrake was situated between the driver&#x27;s seat and door (i.e. on the driver&#x27;s right-hand side for a right-hand drive car) rather than between the front seats. This followed the practice established with the &#x27;Audax&#x27; cars.

The first Arrow model to be launched, the Hillman Hunter, was presented as a replacement for the Hillman Super Minx. The Hunter was lighter than its predecessor and the wheel-base of the new car was actually shorter than that of the old, but the length of the passenger cabin was nonetheless increased by moving the engine and the toe-board forwards.

For the first two years there were few changes. However, in May 1968 power assisted brakes were made available as a factory fitted option. Hitherto this possibility had been offered only as a kit for retro-fitting: it was stated that the factory fitted servo-assistance, at a domestic market price slightly below £13, would be cheaper for customers.

A mild facelift in 1970 gave new grilles to the various Hunter trim levels, and some derivatives gained a (then) more fashionable dashboard, exchanging wood for plastic, but the car remained fundamentally the same throughout its life.

A more detailed facelift for 1972 brought a new all-plastic dashboard with deeply hooded round dials (earlier versions had either a strip speedometer or round dials in a flat dashboard for more expensive models like the Vogue), new steering wheel, plastic instead of metal air cleaner, reshaped squarer headlamps in a new grille and some engine tuning changes.

For 1975, bumpers were enlarged and the tail lights were enclosed in a full-width anodised aluminium trim piece.

Following the 1967 acquisition of Rootes by Chrysler, the Arrow derivatives were rationalised until only the Hillman Hunter version was left by 1976. From September 1977 it was re-badged as a Chrysler, which it was to be for the remaining 2 years of its life. Hunter production was switched in 1969 to Rootes&#x27; troubled Imp plant in Linwood, from its original home of Ryton.

Sales were lower after 1975 following the launch of the Chrysler Alpine, a similar sized car but with front-wheel drive and a hatchback bodystyle, at a time when rear-wheel drive saloons still dominated in this sector.

Following the Hillman Avenger&#x27;s move to Linwood in 1976, the very last European Hunters were assembled in the Santry plant, Shanowen Road, Ireland from &quot;complete knock down&quot; (CKD) kits until production ended in 1979 – but no evidence exists to suggest that the Talbot badge was applied to any production Hunter following Chrysler Europe&#x27;s 1978 takeover by Peugeot, and the application of that badge to other Chrysler models sold on or after 1 August 1979.

The final Chrysler Hunter was built in September 1979 in Porirua, New Zealand, and was donated to the Southward Museum. In 2000 the Museum sold the car to a private collector.

==Models and market positions==
As Rootes looked to rationalise the number of platforms and the total engineering cost of their vehicle line-up during the 1960s, they kept alive the many names of the companies they had purchased to maintain product differentiation in the market place. As such, the Arrow was simultaneously aimed at several slightly different market segments, using a range of brand and model names during the car&#x27;s 13-year production run.

===Hillman===

The first models, launched on the domestic market in October 1966 with a 1725 cc engine, were given the Hillman Hunter name with the respected name Hillman Minx (for the cheaper 1496 cc version), following in January 1967. Hillman would remain the British group&#x27;s most prolific marque. The Hunter model name was not in fact entirely new for a Rootes-related car, having been used for one year&#x27;s production of the Singer SM1500.

Sports models included the Hillman GT, which was based on the Minx trim, but was a model in its own right (not a &quot;Hillman Minx GT&quot; nor &quot;Hillman Hunter GT&quot;). It featured a twin Zenith Stromberg CD150 carburettor version of the 1725 engine developing and Ro-Style wheels. in 1972 came the Hillman Hunter GLS with a specially tuned twin-Weber-carburettor engine (by Holbay) shared with the Sunbeam Rapier H120 model, as well as close-ratio gearbox and quad headlights.

The estate version, announced in April 1967, was originally launched as the &quot;Hillman Estate Car&quot; without either Hunter or Minx badging. It came with a one-piece tailgate which was much cheaper to produce than the horizontally split two piece tailgate featured on the car it replaced, but the change nevertheless drew some unfavourable press comment.

The car&#x27;s image was boosted when a Hunter driven by Andrew Cowan won the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon.

The range was soon simplified with trim levels and varying engine specifications: the Hillman Hunter DeLuxe or DL replaced the Minx and retained the Minx 1496 cc engine; the 1725 cc engine with an iron cylinder head being an option on these entry-level models. Above that were the Hunter Super and Hunter GL, both with the higher specification alloy headed engine and two different trim levels. The twin carburettor engined &quot;Hillman Hunter GT&quot; eventually replaced the Hillman GT, and the Holbay-engined GLS was positioned at the top of the range.

For the 1975 Motor Show, a limited edition Hillman Hunter Topaz was produced. This was largely based on the Hunter Super and equipped with overdrive, radio, vinyl roof, Rostyle wheels and a special half cloth upholstery as standard. This car was only available in a unique metallic bronze paint finish. The price was less than that of the standard Hunter Super when fitted with the optional overdrive. A Hillman Break de Chasse was sold in French-speaking markets, based on the Minx specification. (Also offered was a similar Sunbeam Break de Chasse; &quot;break&quot; being a French term for an estate, and the phrase &quot;break de chasse&quot; translating roughly as shooting-brake.)

===Singer===

The Singer Vogue and Singer Gazelle were positioned slightly upmarket of the Hillman Hunter and the Minx respectively. Nevertheless, the need to compete on price was evidenced with the announcement of the Singer Vogue estate car. The Vogue saloon was fitted with an alternator, but the Vogue estate, announced in April 1967, was fitted with a dynamo; the manufacturers explained that the change was made to help keep the model&#x27;s recommended UK-market selling price below £1,000.

The Singers were short-lived models, retired early in 1970 along with the rest of the Singer range. Briefly following the retirement of the Singer brand, and throughout the model life for principal export markets, the Singer Vogue was badged as a Sunbeam.

===Sunbeam===
The single-carburettor Sunbeam Alpine and twin-carburettor Sunbeam Rapier were only sold as fastback coupés, and were marketed with a strong sporting image – although it was eventually the Hillman Hunter which was used in long-distance rallying. The sportiest Sunbeam was the Rapier H120 model, though this shared its specially tuned Holbay engine with the Hillman Hunter GLS.

Sunbeam Arrow, Sunbeam Break de Chasse, Sunbeam Hunter, Sunbeam Minx, Sunbeam Sceptre and Sunbeam Vogue were used for export markets where the Sunbeam name was more familiar or deemed more likely to succeed. The Sunbeam Arrow name was used in North America. Sunbeam Break de Chasse, Hunter, Vogue and Minx were offered in some French-speaking markets (where &quot;break&quot; is a term for an estate).

A Sunbeam Sceptre appeared in France and some German-speaking markets (at least), and carried the Humber Sceptre level of specification, as described below. The Sunbeam Vogue was also available in the home (British) market for a short period after the Singer marque was retired in 1970.
===Humber===
The Humber Sceptre traded on Humber&#x27;s tradition of building luxury cars and was the best-appointed version. It was marketed as a Sunbeam Sceptre in some markets.

The manual-gearbox model featured either the D-type or the later J-type Laycock De Normanville overdrive, with the J-type fitted from chassis numbers L3 onwards starting in July 1972. As with all Arrows, an automatic gearbox was an option. A closer ratio G-type gearbox was fitted to later Sceptres, using the J-type overdrive.

An estate version of the Humber Sceptre was introduced at the London Motor Show in October 1974. It featured a built-in roof rack and a carpeted loading floor protected by metal strips and illuminated by an additional interior light. Washer and wiper were provided for the rear window, a rare feature on UK-market estate cars of the time.

===Chrysler Hunter===

The Hillman Hunter was rebranded as the Chrysler Hunter for the UK market in September 1976, receiving at the same time a four headlight frontal treatment similar to that of the Hunter GLS model and the Humber Sceptre. In order to try to prolong the model life an improved level of equipment included a central console and a voltmeter. The Super version also featured an aluminium-head engine and viscous fan coupling along with reclining seats, a vinyl-covered roof and &quot;simulated wood treatment&quot; for the facia and door sills. By this time, however, Chrysler UK dealers had been selling the French-built Chrysler Alpine for more than two years: more than ten years after the launch of the original Hillman Hunter, the Chrysler Hunter was self-evidently a run-out model, and relatively few were produced. According to How Many Left, only 7 remain in the UK with only 1 still on the road. The European operations of Chrysler were sold to Peugeot just before the end of Hunter production in 1979, although the Chrysler branding was briefly retained, with the Talbot marque being introduced across Europe from 1 August 1979.

It was effectively replaced by the Talbot Solara – a four-door saloon version of the Alpine hatchback – which was launched in April 1980.

==Production outside Britain==
===Australia===

Commencing in 1967, Chrysler Australia Ltd assembled the Hillman Hunter from imported CKD packs at their Port Melbourne factory, which they inherited as part of Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of Rootes Australia. Designated as the HB series, the range comprised two models, the Arrow with basic vinyl upholstery and floormats, and the Hunter, with better quality upholstery and carpeted floors. A Hunter Safari wagon was added to the range in May 1968. The Safari name was also used to identify the Australian Chrysler Valiant wagons. The Safari was a popular seller, particularly as the competing Holden Torana was not available as an estate / station wagon.

The HC series was released in November 1968. Major changes were the adoption of the UK face-lifted Hunter radiator grille and rectangular headlights, and the renaming of the Arrow as the Hunter, retaining the Arrow&#x27;s trim specification and bench seat. The Hunter was renamed to Hunter Royal, the model corresponding in trim level with the UK Singer Vogue, but retaining the Hunter plastic moulded dashboard, with simulated wood trim. An additional model, the Hunter GT, corresponded with the UK Humber Sceptre in trim level, but utilized the standard Hunter grille. These cars featured trim parts from various UK models, including UK Humber Sceptre bonnet ornaments.

In 1970, the Australian version of the Hunter was face-lifted again, with the introduction of the HE series. Marketing of the car, plus its rear badges, referred to it as the Hunter, rather than a Hillman. The facelift involved a change to the radiator grille, with new and smaller rectangular headlights. Also, the appearance of the rear of the car was changed with a flush trim panel under the boot lid and new twin-lens tail lights. Depending on the model, this panel was painted in the body colour, matte grey or matte black (Hustler Model); this facelift was unique to Australia. Inside, the HE models received a new collapsible steering column, with the Valiant&#x27;s steering wheel.

The model range was later modified again: a new cut price performance version called the Hustler was introduced. This was similar in concept and execution to the UK Hillman GT – a sparsely trimmed car with high performance. The Hustler was powered by the Rootes Group 1725cc engine, equipped with alloy head and twin Stromberg side-draught carburettors. The Hustler&#x27;s styling alluded to its big brother; the Chrysler Valiant (VG) Pacer.

The Hunter GT was renamed the Hunter Royal 660. Outside, this car gained Rostyle wheels. Inside, the car was trimmed in the same &quot;buffalo grain&quot; textured vinyl, which also was to be found in the VG series luxury Valiant, the Regal 770.

These cars sold steadily, but they became overshadowed when Chrysler Australia commenced assembly of the Mitsubishi Galant in 1972. By this time, the Mitsubishi was a conspicuously more modern car, and the last Australian Hunter was produced in November 1972. The stockpile of vehicles took almost a year to clear and the Hunter became the last Rootes car to be marketed in Australia. Chrysler Australia then closed the former Rootes factory, focusing Australian production at its Tonsley Park plant in Adelaide.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand importer and CKD assembler Todd Motors also created its own unique versions of the Arrow line. The single 1967 launch version (1725 cc aluminium head engine with four-speed manual transmission or three-speed Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission with twin front seats) was almost identical to its UK counterpart but Todd started to use its own upholstery designs from the 1969 rectangular headlight update. For 1970, it added a silver rear trim panel and a &#x27;by Chrysler&#x27; boot lid badge to the Hunter saloon and introduced the estate although this had a lower specification than the saloon – an iron head 1725 cc engine, no automatic option, simpler dashboard trim (no locking glovebox), interior door pull handles instead of armrests (sedans had them on the three passenger doors), painted rather than bright metal door window frame trim and fixed rather than opening front quarter-lights. Because the hand brake was between the driver&#x27;s seat and the driver&#x27;s door, for safety reasons, there wasn&#x27;t an arm rest on the driver&#x27;s door.

Todd&#x27;s also offered a Singer Vogue saloon with a 1725 cc engine and a more upmarket wood veneer dashboard from 1967 to 1971. It was replaced by the Hunter GL.

The range was given a unique-to-NZ update early in 1971: the iron head &quot;deluxe&quot; estate (never badged as such) was almost unchanged apart from the side &quot;Hunter&quot; badges moving from the front doors to the front guards and revised seat and door trim patterns, and the door tops switched from black to the same colour as the seats. The alloy headed &quot;super&quot; saloon got these changes plus a redesigned &#x27;by Chrysler&#x27; boot lid badge, spray-on black, instead of silver, tail panel — the texture of this changed from textured fake vinyl to a matte black over the year&#x27;s run. Initially the cars were offered with tan, red, blue or black upholstery with the dash painted to match but after a few months, Todd&#x27;s switched to a new type of vinyl with different colours and texture for their Avenger, Hunter and Valiant lines, the blue option was dropped and the dashboards reverted to black paint. By now the equivalent Super model in the UK had seen its specification reduced to the iron head engine, no bumper over-riders, less exterior bright metal detailing and fixed front quarterlights — so the New Zealand version was unique.

The range&#x27;s first major facelift for 1972 brought an uprated motor with new carburettor and ignition tuning, re-profiled camshaft and a plastic air cleaner housing (these models were always harder to keep in tune than their predecessors), smaller, squarer headlamps, a new dashboard with deeply hooded round dials (the Hunters had strip speedometers previously), high-backed front seats, and a revised silver trim panel surrounding the tail lights. These models carried over the previous models&#x27; upholstery material and colours for about a year but there was a mid-1973 change to the then-new &#x27;wet look&#x27; vinyl across all Kiwi assembled Chrysler/Hillman models and the Hunter shared the new cream, brown and blue colours, retaining black dashboards and interior plastics (UK cars had fully colour matched interiors in different colours with available cloth trim, a material Todd&#x27;s would not introduce till the Hunter&#x27;s final years).

Todds also added a new 1972 &quot;GL&quot; model, replacing the Singer Vogue, that initially had little to distinguish it (and justify a higher price) apart from wooden dashboard and door inserts, the same different trim patterns from the old Vogue and standard reversing lights. On all sedans, the rear Hunter badge moved from the right hand side of the boot lid to inboard of the left side tail lamp cluster and a locally sourced derivative badge appeared denoting &quot;Super&quot;, &quot;Super Auto&quot; and &quot;GL&quot; variants (but not the available &quot;GL Auto&quot; which was badged just &quot;GL&quot;). In 1973 Todds created another completely unique model by updating the &quot;GL&quot; with a simplified variant of the four-headlight nose from the upmarket Humber Sceptre (a rare UK-assembled import) and altering the tail with a new silver strip below the tail lights, incorporating the reversing lights. These changes gave the &quot;GL&quot; a much more distinctive appearance front and rear.

By the mid-70s, the Hunter was an old model and under siege from newer Japanese rivals. Todd&#x27;s Hunters adopted the larger bumpers and new grille introduced for 1975 in the UK but the range was eventually rationalised into a single Super saloon model with the four-headlight front end and &quot;wood&quot; dashboard inserts (by then it was synthetic wood rather than the real material used originally). The final updates included standard cigarette lighter and heater control illumination.

Around 1975, the optional automatic was uprated from the three-speed Borg Warner 35 to the new, four-speed 45 but there were supply problems and Todds reverted to the 35 three-speed for several assembly runs of the automatic versions.

As in Australia, though six years later, Mitsubishis from Japan sounded the Hunter&#x27;s death knell. After beginning with CKD assembly of a single Galant coupé model in 1972, Todds had added the Lancer saloon in 1975 and launched its first mid-size Mitsubishi Galant Sigma saloon line in 1977, effectively replacing the Hunter. The far more modern, better equipped Mitsubishis were pricier, and the Hunter still had its fans and lingered on until 1979, when it was discontinued in the UK and Todd&#x27;s built the last Chrysler-badged version anywhere.

The Hunter&#x27;s other claim to Kiwi fame was being the first CKD model line to pass the 30,000-unit mark during its 12-year run.

===South Africa===
The Hunter and the Vogue were assembled locally in South Africa, beginning in 1968. The Vogue received Hillman badging, and the Hunter Deluxe model was sold as the &quot;Hillman Arrow&quot;. Since local assembler Stanley Motors also assembled Peugeots, the Arrow cars received the 404&#x27;s 1618 cc, XC engine. This continued to be used until the end of South African production in mid-1977 (by Sigma for the last six months, Chrysler SA&#x27;s successor company), although for 1976 the 504&#x27;s 1971 cc XN1 was available on the renamed Chrysler Vogue 2000. The Hunter Wagon was also locally assembled, this was renamed the &quot;Hunter Safari&quot; for 1972. The Arrow was dropped at the same time.

In 1975 the &quot;Dodge Husky&quot; was released as a Hunter-based pickup truck powered by the British 1725 cc unit. The Dodge Husky is different from the Iranian Paykan pickup model; it has a thicker B-pillar and retains the saloon&#x27;s character lines along the side panels. The rear gate and rear window are also subtly different. For 1976, the Hillman name was dropped and the passenger car versions were renamed as Chrysler Vogues. The 2000 GL, GLS, and Safari received the larger Peugeot engine.

===Iranian Paykan===
In 1966, Iran National (now Iran Khodro) of Iran began to assemble Hillman Hunters from CKD kits, after a deal was struck between the Rootes Group and Iran National&#x27;s director, Ahmad Khayami. The resulting Paykan (Persian for arrow) saloon, utility, and taxi models became known as Iran&#x27;s national car.

Earlier versions used the Hunter engine, but later kits were shipped with the Avenger&#x27;s 1600 cc engine mated to the Arrow range 4-speed gearbox via a special bell-housing. Later, they were all equipped with a 5-speed gearbox. The engine was changed to a Multi Point Electronic Fuel Injection made by the Sagem Company. The spark distributor was replaced with ECU-Controlled Spark Coils. The differential was also upgraded to a version more compatible with the Avenger engine.

In 1977 Roy Axe designed the new facelifted Paykan model using many interior and exterior parts from the Chrysler Alpine.

Full local production began in 1985, after the original British production lines were closed. The new owner in Britain, Peugeot, established a new contract whereby Iran Khodro would manufacture the Paykan with the same body panels but using Peugeot 504 engines and suspension, for six more years. This deal was similar to one in South Africa, where Hunters were once built with locally-made Peugeot 404 engines (from which the 504 units evolved) to meet strict local-content laws applicable in the late 1960s.

The Paykan saloon ceased production in May 2005, to be replaced by the Iranian designed Samand. The Bardo 1600i, the pick-up version of the Paykan, continued to be the sole remaining Arrow variant until the final car rolled off the Teheran Assembly line in May 2015.
===Peru===
The Hillman Hunter was also built by Chrysler in Peru, both in sedan and estate bodystyles.

<text>Graham Ford Towers (29 September 1897 – 4 December 1975) was the first governor of the Bank of Canada from 1934 to 1954.

== Biography ==
Born in Montreal, Quebec, educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Toronto, graduating in 1913. He attended McGill University in 1915, and was a member of the University Canadian Officer Training Corps. In the summer of 1915 Towers left McGill for Stanley Barracks and Officer Training at Exhibition Place where he was commissioned a Provisional Lieutenant in the Canadian Army Service Corps on September 29, 1915. On December 8, Lt Towers passed his qualifying exam and obtained his Certificate in Equitation (Horsemanship). In March of 1917, he joined the CEF and proceeded to France as a Railhead Supply Officer attached to the British 1st Army Headquarters. In late 1918 Lt Towers contracted Influenza and was shipped to Canada to recover. In the Spring of 1919 Towers returned to McGill University to study Law, graduating in December with a Bachelor of Arts degree with first class Honors in Economics and Political Science as a member of the Veterans Accelerated Class. He was discharged from the Canadian Army Service Corps on 13 September 1919.

During World War II, he was Chairman of the Foreign Exchange Control Board and Chairman of the National War Finance Committee. From 1944 to 1954, he was President of the Industrial Development Bank and from 1946 until 1954 he was alternate Governor for Canada at the International Monetary Fund. A longtime executive at the Royal Bank of Canada he was a strong proponent of the creation the Bank of Canada, Canada&#x27;s Central Bank. He led the Bank of Canada for twenty years before he was succeeded by James Coyne. 

Towers was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1944. In 1969, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Towers provided evidence for the Canadian Government&#x27;s Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, in 1939 and revealed much about the way banking works in Canada. In one exchange with Gerry McGeer he is quoted as saying &quot;If parliament wants to change the form of operating the banking system, then certainly that is within the power of parliament&quot; when asked &quot;Will you tell me why a government with power to create money, should give that power away to a private monopoly, and then borrow that which parliament can create itself, back at interest, to the point of national bankruptcy?&quot;

<text>Exene Cervenka (born Christene Lee Cervenka; February 1, 1956) is an American singer, artist, and poet. She is best known for her work as a singer in the California punk rock band X.

== Music career ==
The 21-year-old Cervenka met 23-year-old musician John Doe at a poetry workshop at the Beyond Baroque Foundation in Venice, California. Cervenka started working there.

Billy Zoom (guitar) and John Doe (bass and vocals) founded X in 1977, with D.J. Bonebrake coming aboard as drummer. Doe asked Cervenka to join soon after as a co-lead vocalist, and the duo were also the band&#x27;s primary songwriters. They released their debut album, &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, in 1980 and, over the next six years, five more albums.

She learned to play guitar from Dave Alvin of The Blasters.

=== Collaborations ===

In 1982, Cervenka published &quot;Adulterers Anonymous&quot;, her first in a series of four books in collaboration with artist Lydia Lunch. She and Lunch also released a spoken word album, &quot;Rude Hieroglyphics&quot;, in 1996 and toured in support of the project.

From 1996 to 1999, John Roecker and Cervenka co-owned the Los Angeles store You&#x27;ve Got Bad Taste. The store specialized in kitsch and various &quot;off-color&quot; novelties.

In 1999, as Exene Červenková, she appeared in the cult video &quot;Decoupage 2000: Return of the Goddess&quot;, along with guests Karen Black and the band L7. She gave a reading of her poem &quot;They Must Be Angels,&quot; and appeared in an interview skit with &quot;Decoupage 2000&quot; hostess Summer Caprice.

== Art career ==
In 2005, Cervenka&#x27;s journals and mixed media collages were exhibited in a one-person exhibition titled &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. The exhibit was curated by Kristine McKenna and Michael Duncan. An expanded version of the exhibition traveled to DCKT Contemporary in New York in January 2006.

== Personal life ==
Cervenka was married to John Doe from 1980 to 1985. She met her second husband Viggo Mortensen in 1986 on the set of the comedy &quot;Salvation!&quot;, a parody of televangelism. Mortensen played her husband Jerome. They married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to a son, Henry Blake Mortensen. Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years. They separated in 1992, and were divorced in 1997.

Cervenka married musician Jason Edge, who went on to play in her band Original Sinners. Edge and Cervenka are now divorced.

Cervenka moved from Los Angeles to Jefferson City, Missouri, for four years, and then returned to Southern California. She now lives in Orange County.

=== Health ===
On June 2, 2009, Cervenka disclosed that she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Well before this diagnosis, she and X had actively supported Sweet Relief, a charity that aids uninsured artists. Sweet Relief was begun by musician Victoria Williams when she herself was diagnosed with MS. In 2011, Cervenka said she may have been misdiagnosed. However, Cervenka had to cancel a Spring 2011 tour due to problems associated with her MS. In 2015, John Doe said that the MS diagnosis was incorrect, and that Cervenka had consulted with other doctors who were not able to diagnose her.

=== Conspiracy theories ===
Cervenka has provoked controversy on social media and YouTube, under the name &quot;Christine Notmyrealname,&quot; by advancing conspiracy theories, including that the Isla Vista shootings were a hoax designed to bring about stricter gun control laws. After backlash, she issued an apology and her conspiracy related YouTube videos are no longer available.

<text>Sui Sin Far (, born Edith Maude Eaton; 15 March 1865 – 7 April 1914) was an author known for her writing about Chinese people in North America and the Chinese American experience. &quot;Sui Sin Far&quot;, the pen name under which most of her work was published, is the Cantonese name of the narcissus flower, popular amongst Chinese people.

==Life account==
Born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, England, Eaton was the daughter of Englishman Edward Eaton, a merchant who met her Chinese mother Achuen Grace Amoy in Shanghai, China.

Eaton was the eldest daughter and second child of fourteen children born to the couple. In 1865, her family left England to live in Hudson, New York, United States, but stayed there only a short time before returning to England in 1868. The family returned to North America in 1872, relocating to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Her father worked as a clerk for Grand Trunk Railway and perhaps for Hudon Mills. In 1882, he left his job and attempted to earn a living through his art. Nonetheless, the children were educated at home and raised in an intellectually stimulating environment that saw both Edith and her younger sister Winnifred, who wrote under the pen name Onoto Watanna, become successful writers.

Because of their poverty, at a young age, Edith Eaton left school to work in order to help support her family. By age 18, Eaton was setting type for the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;. She began writing as a young girl; her stories and poetry were accepted for publication in Montreal&#x27;s &quot;Dominion Illustrated&quot; magazine, and, beginning in 1890, she published anonymous journalistic articles about the local Chinese community in Montreal&#x27;s English-language newspapers, the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; and the &quot;Daily Witness&quot;. She also worked as a stenographer and legal secretary. She left Montreal first in 1891 to work as a stenographer and special correspondent in what is now Thunder Bay, Ontario. In 1896, she worked as a journalist for &quot;Gall&#x27;s News Letter&quot; in Kingston, Jamaica, for about six months, and began to publish under her Chinese pen name. Eaton also published using a Chinese man&#x27;s name, Wing Sing.

Later, she moved to San Francisco, Los Angeles then in Seattle, before going to the east coast to work in Boston. While working as a legal secretary she continued to write. Although her appearance and manners would have allowed her to easily pass as an Englishwoman, she asserted her Chinese heritage after 1896 and wrote articles that told what life was like for a Chinese woman in white America. First published in 1896, her fictional stories about Chinese Americans were a reasoned appeal for her society&#x27;s acceptance of working-class Chinese at a time when the United States Congress maintained the Chinese Exclusion Act, which banned Chinese immigration to the United States.

Over the ensuing years, Eaton wrote a number of short stories and newspaper articles while working on her first collection of fiction. Published in June 1912, &quot;Mrs. Spring Fragrance&quot; was a collection that included some linked short stories that was marketed as a novel.

Eaton never married. She died in Montreal and is interred in Mount Royal Cemetery.

A study of Eaton and her life, &quot;Sui Sin Far/Edith Maude Eaton: A Literary Biography&quot; by Annette White-Parks, was published in 1995. &quot;Becoming Sui Sin Far: Early Fiction, Journalism and Travel Writing by Edith Maude Eaton&quot; by Mary Chapman updates this earlier study.

==Themes==
As a child, Eaton witnessed hatred of and prejudice against Chinese people. This inclined her to write on the Chinese experience, with some of her works focusing on her own experiences as a Chinese person. In &quot;In the Land of the Free&quot;, Eaton writes about what it meant to be a Chinese woman in a white man&#x27;s world. Many of Sui Sin Far/Edith Eaton&#x27;s unsigned works are about the daily lives of Chinese people in Canada and the United States. The topics of these pieces range from the food Chinese people eat to the things they do for fun.

==Contemporary interests==
Many academics cite Sui Sin Far/Edith Eaton as one of the first North American writers of Chinese ancestry. For this reason, there has been recent interest in Sui Sin Far&#x27;s works and their revival.

Mary Chapman, a professor in the Department of English at the University of British Columbia, has published &quot;Becoming Sui Sin Far: Early Fiction, Journalism, and Travel Writing by Edith Maude Eaton&quot;, a collection of 70 of Eaton&#x27;s early writings. Most of these pieces had not been republished since their first appearance in newspapers. She is also the director of the Winnifred Eaton Archive

Ying Xu, an adjunct faculty member in the Department of English and the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures at the University of New Mexico, has also been conducting scholarly work on Sui Sin Far. She contributed to the article &quot;Edith Maude Eaton (Sui Sin Far)&quot;. In 2017, she published &quot;Sui Sin Far’s “The Land of the Free” in the era of Trump&quot;, which makes connections between Far&#x27;s writings and the current socio-political climate of the Trump era.

<doc id="520210" wikidata="Q357782" url="?curid=520210" title="Luis Ramírez de Lucena">
<text>Luis Ramírez de Lucena (c. 1465 – c. 1530) was a Spanish chess player who published the first extant chess book. He is believed to be the son of humanist writer and diplomat Juan de Lucena.

==Book==

Lucena wrote the oldest surviving printed book on chess, &quot;Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con CL [150] Juegos de Partido&quot; (&quot;Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess with 150 Games&quot;), published in Salamanca around 1497. The book includes analysis of eleven chess openings but also contains many elementary errors that led chess historian H. J. R. Murray to suggest that it was prepared in a hurry. The book was written when the rules of chess were taking their modern form (see origins of modern chess), and some of the 150 positions in the book are of the old game and some of the new. Fewer than a dozen copies of the book exist.

Commentators have suggested that much of the material was copied from Francesc Vicent&#x27;s now-lost 1495 work &quot;Libre dels jochs partits dels schacs en nombre de 100&quot;.

The Lucena position is named after him, even though it does not appear in his book. (It was first published in 1634 by Alessandro Salvio.) The smothered mate (later named &quot;Philidor&#x27;s legacy&quot;) is in the book.

<text>The Antarctic plate is a tectonic plate containing the continent of Antarctica, the Kerguelen Plateau, and some remote islands in the Southern Ocean and other surrounding oceans. After breakup from Gondwana (the southern part of the supercontinent Pangea), the Antarctic plate began moving the continent of Antarctica south to its present isolated location, causing the continent to develop a much colder climate. The Antarctic plate is bounded almost entirely by extensional mid-ocean ridge systems. The adjoining plates are the Nazca plate, the South American plate, the African plate, the Somali plate, the Indo-Australian plate, the Pacific plate, and, across a transform boundary, the Scotia and South Sandwich plates.

The Antarctic plate has an area of about . It is Earth&#x27;s fifth-largest tectonic plate.

The Antarctic plate&#x27;s movement is estimated to be at least per year towards the Atlantic Ocean.

==Subduction beneath South America==
The Antarctic plate started to subduct beneath South America 14 million years ago in the Miocene epoch. At first it subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile triple junction lay near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of the Nazca plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction the more northerly regions of the Antarctic plate began to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile triple junction lies at present in front of Taitao Peninsula at 46°15&#x27; S. 
The subduction of the Antarctic plate beneath South America is held to have uplifted Patagonia as it reduced the previously vigorous down-dragging flow in the Earth&#x27;s mantle caused by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath Patagonia. The dynamic topography caused by this uplift raised Quaternary-aged marine terraces and beaches across the Atlantic coast of Patagonia.

<text>The village college is an institution specific to Cambridgeshire, England, including the Peterborough unitary authority area. It caters for the education of 11- to 16-year-olds during the day,
and provides educational and leisure facilities to the wider community out of school hours.

Village colleges were the brainchild of Henry Morris, the then Chief Education Officer for Cambridgeshire, who had a vision of a school that would serve the whole community, stem migration from the countryside to the towns, and provide a decent education to pupils who had previously only been served by the upper years of elementary schools. His original plan was that the site of the college would also be home to the village&#x27;s other public services. The first, Sawston Village College, opened in 1930 with Bottisham, Linton, and Bassingbourn following a few years later. Under Morris&#x27; influence, many of the colleges have had distinguished architects, notably the one at Impington designed by Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry.

Between the implementation of the Education Act 1944 and Cambridgeshire&#x27;s adoption of the Comprehensive school system in 1974, village colleges were effectively reduced to secondary modern schools, apart from Sawston which operated both a grammar and a secondary modern scheme. Since 1974 village colleges have returned to their original mission as schools for the whole community. Most of the colleges are now parts of larger, multi-academy trusts.

There are village colleges throughout Cambridgeshire,
including Bassingbourn, Bottisham, Comberton, Cottenham, Impington, Linton, Melbourn, Sawston, Soham, Swavesey and Witchford. The most recent, Cambourne Village College, opened in September 2013.

<text>Soham Village College is a secondary school with academy status located in Soham, Cambridgeshire, England. It has around 1,400 pupils, aged 11 to 16. Although its wide catchment area does not include Ely, some pupils from there and its neighbouring villages attend the college. It is split between two adjacent sites: Beechurst, formerly a large house, and Lodeside, built more recently.

==History==
The college has its origins in Soham Free School, established in 1686. It became known as Soham Grammar School from 1878 and occupied a site on Churchgate Street. In 1925 the grammar school moved to Beechurst House (built in 1901 and located in Sand Street, which had formerly been the home of the late Newmarket jockey, Charles Morbey. The grammar school took boys aged 11–18 from surrounding villages, and also had a few weekly boarders.

The name &quot;Soham Village College&quot; comes from the former secondary modern style village college, which was established in 1958. The original village college took boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 15, and was built on a site next to the Soham Lode known as &quot;Moat Fields&quot;. It took in senior children from a number of &quot;national schools&quot; which were converted to junior or primary schools. The village college system was the brainchild of Henry Morris, the Chief Education Officer at Cambridgeshire County Council. The college was officially opened by the baronet and MP Sir Edward Boyle, a former Minister for Education. Morris&#x27;s emphasis was on a community-based establishment, and the college was equipped with a public library and a youth leader.

The present village college emerged in 1972 when the modern co-educational village college and the long-established grammar school merged. The merger was a direct result of the government raising the school-leaving age to 16.

Throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, building work was carried out under the headships of A. E. Lawrence (1972–85) and Dr A. W. Bullock (1985–99). This included the construction of the Ross Peers Sports Centre, a music block, and a science and technology block.

In 1993 the college gained grant-maintained status. This allowed for generous donations, such as the funds donated in the mid-1990s by Simon Gibson to extend the mathematics and English departments (known as the Gibson Block in his honour).

In June 1998, &quot;M Block&quot;, which contains science, humanities, ICT and languages rooms, was opened by Princess Margaret.

In August 2002 the school became infamous as the place where a double child-killer, Ian Huntley, worked as school caretaker. Clothing from the murdered children was found in the school grounds, leading to Huntley&#x27;s arrest and eventual conviction in the Soham murders case. Huntley&#x27;s house on the school site, and the storage hangar where the clothing was found, were later demolished.

The school was previously a specialist Technology College and Language College before converting to academy status on 1 April 2011.

Since November 2019, a parkrun (a free, weekly timed 5 km run/walk event) has taken place at Soham Village College every Saturday morning at 9.00am.

==Academic reputation==
In the school&#x27;s 2010 public exam results, 73 per cent achieved at least five grade A–C GCSEs. The school still attracts pupils from many schools within and outside the catchment area. Many take the opportunity of obtaining extracurricular GCSEs, including astronomy and statistics.

However, pupils wishing to continue onto sixth form studies must change schools, usually attending establishments in nearby Ely or Cambridge.

==Awards==
Soham Village College has received many awards. Currently the school has specialisms in technology and languages. The college has been awarded the Artsmark – Bronze Award, International School Award, School Achievement Award, Sport England SportsMark Award, Basic Skills Quality Mark, and the ICT Mark for excellence in ICT.

The school awards pupils for various achievements, such as outstanding attendance, distinctive progression and extra-curricular activities out of school, such as sport. Scarlet ties are awarded to pupils who excel in sport, both in school and at county level; emerald ties are awarded to pupils in the performing arts, in school or in county-level performance organisations; gold ties are awarded to pupils in the visual arts, in school or in community events. The Headteacher&#x27;s Tie is awarded to pupils who display exceptional performance in and out of school.

==Catchment area==
The school has a wide catchment area, owing to its rural location. Pupils come mainly from the following areas:
Soham,
Barway,
Wicken,
Fordham,
Isleham,
Chippenham,
Snailwell,
Kennett, and
Burwell.

However, some pupils come from other nearby settlements outside of the catchment area including:
Stuntney,
Ely,
Littleport,
Newmarket,
Little Downham,
Witchford,
Stretham,
Wilburton, and
Haddenham.

The principal feeder primary schools are:
*St Andrew&#x27;s Church of England Primary (Soham)
*The Weatheralls (Soham)
*The Shade School (Soham)
*Fordham Church of England Primary
*Isleham Church of England Primary
*Kennett Primary
*Burwell Village College (Primary)
*Ely St John&#x27;s (Primary)
*Ely St Mary&#x27;s (Primary)

==50th anniversary celebrations (1958–2008)==
A weekend of celebrations was staged to mark the 50th anniversary of Soham Village College. Between 23 and 25 January 2009, displays of memorabilia and personal souvenirs provided a chronological account of past events and life at the Village College.

<text>The first Athlete of the Year award in the United States was initiated by the Associated Press (AP) in 1931. At a time when women in sports were not given the same recognition as men, the AP offered a male and a female athlete of the year award to either a professional or amateur athlete. The awards are voted on annually by a panel of AP sports editors from across the United States, covering mainly American sports. As a result, a large majority of the winners have been Americans. However, non-Americans are also eligible for the honor and have won on a few occasions.

<text>Gijsbert &quot;Gijs&quot; van Lennep (; born 16 March 1942) is a Dutch racing driver who competed in eight Formula One races. However, his main achievements were in sports car racing. He is a member of the untitled Dutch nobility.

== Career ==
Van Lennep drove for the Porsche sportscar team beginning in 1967. He shared the number 22 Martini Racing Porsche 917K with Helmut Marko, winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1971. They set a distance record, covering , which remained unbeaten until 2010.

Also in 1971, the &quot;Stichting Autoraces Nederland&quot; (Foundation for Car races in the Netherlands) hired a Surtees TS7 for him to make his F1 debut in his home GP where he finished a creditable eighth in a very wet GP. The following year Van Lennep won the 1972 Rothmans European Formula 5000 Championship driving a Surtees TS11 and a McLaren M18. He also drove twice for the Williams GP team, earning his first World Championship point with sixth place in the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix. With Ensign, he scored a second point in the 1975 German Grand Prix, making him the fifth most successful Dutch Formula One driver behind Max Verstappen, Jos Verstappen, Carel Godin de Beaufort and Christijan Albers.

In 1973, he won the last Targa Florio, sharing the Martini Porsche Carrera RSR with Herbert Müller. He continued with sportscar racing, sharing a Porsche 936 Turbo with Jacky Ickx to win Le Mans 24 for a second time in 1976, before retiring from racing.

<text>A thimble is a small pitted cup worn on the finger that protects it from being pricked or poked by a needle while sewing. The Old English word , the ancestor of thimble, is derived from Old English , the ancestor of the English word &quot;thumb&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-17th century===

As the purpose of a thimble is to prevent discomfort while sewing by providing a barrier between fingertips and the blunt end of a needle, it is likely that the earliest thimbles were created closely following the invention of sewing.

According to the United Kingdom Detector Finds Database, thimbles dating to the 10th century have been found in England, and thimbles were in widespread use there by the 14th century.

Although there are isolated examples of thimbles made of precious metals—Elizabeth I is said to have given one of her ladies-in-waiting a thimble set with precious stones—the vast majority of metal thimbles were made of brass. Medieval thimbles were either cast brass or made from hammered sheet. Early centers of thimble production were those places known for brass-working, starting with Nuremberg in the 15th century, and moving to Holland by the 17th.

===17th century and later===

In 1693, a Dutch thimble manufacturer named John Lofting established a thimble manufactory in Islington, in London, England, expanding British thimble production to new heights. He later moved his mill to Buckinghamshire to take advantage of water-powered production, resulting in a capacity to produce more than two million thimbles per year. By the end of the 18th century, thimble making had moved to Birmingham, and shifted to the &quot;deep drawing&quot; method of manufacture, which alternated hammering of sheet metals with annealing, and produced a thinner-skinned thimble with a taller shape. At the same time, cheaper sources of silver from the Americas made silver thimbles a popular item for the first time.

Thimbles are usually made from metal, leather, rubber, wood, and even glass or china. Early thimbles were sometimes made from whale bone, horn, or ivory. Natural sources were also utilized such as Connemara marble, bog oak or mother of pearl..

Advanced thimblemakers enhanced thimbles with semi-precious stones to adorn the apex or along the outer rim. Rarer works from thimble makers utilized diamonds, sapphires, or rubies. Cabochon adornments are sometimes made of cinnabar, agate, moonstone, or amber. Thimble artists would also utilize enameling, or the Guilloché techniques advanced by Peter Carl Fabergé.

==As collectibles==
Originally, thimbles were used simply solely for pushing a needle through fabric or leather as it was being sewn. Since then, however, they have gained many other uses. From the 16th century onwards silver thimbles were regarded as an ideal gift for ladies.
Early Meissen porcelain and elaborate, decorated gold thimbles were also given as keepsakes and were usually quite unsuitable for sewing. This tradition has continued to the present day. In the early modern period, thimbles were used to measure spirits and gunpowder, which brought rise to the phrase &quot;just a thimbleful&quot;. Prostitutes used them in the practice of thimble-knocking where they would tap on a window to announce their presence. Thimble-knocking also refers to the practice of Victorian schoolmistresses who would tap on the heads of unruly pupils with dames thimbles.

Before the 18th century, the small dimples on the outside of a thimble were made by hand punching, but in the middle of that century, a machine was invented to do the job. A thimble with an irregular pattern of dimples was likely made before the 1850s. Another consequence of the mechanization of thimble production is that the shape and the thickness of the metal changed. Early thimbles tend to be quite thick and to have a pronounced dome on the top. The metal on later ones is thinner and the top is flatter.

Collecting thimbles became popular in the UK when many companies made special thimbles to commemorate the Great Exhibition held in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London.
In the 19th century, many thimbles were made from silver; however, it was found that silver is too soft a metal and can be easily punctured by most needles. Charles Horner solved the problem by creating thimbles consisting of a steel core covered inside and out by silver, so that they retained their aesthetics but were now more practical and durable. He called his thimble the Dorcas, and these are now popular with collectors. There is a small display of his work in Bankfield Museum, Halifax, England.

Early American thimbles made of whale bone or tooth featuring miniature scrimshaw designs are considered valuable collectibles. Such rare thimbles are prominently featured in a number of New England Whaling Museums.

During the First World War, silver thimbles were collected from &quot;those who had nothing to give&quot; by the British government and melted down to buy hospital equipment. In the 1930s and 1940s glass-topped thimbles were used for advertising.

Leaving a sandalwood thimble in a fabric store was a common practice for keeping moths away. Thimbles have also been used as love-tokens and to commemorate important events. People who collect thimbles are known as digitabulists. One superstition about thimbles says that if a person has three thimbles given to them, they will never be married.

Most of these thimble makers no longer create thimbles.

==Thimblette==
Thimblettes (also known as rubber finger, rubber thimbles and finger cones) are soft thimbles, made predominately of rubber, used primarily for leafing through or counting documents, bank notes, tickets, or forms. They also protect against paper cuts as a secondary function. Unlike thimbles, the softer thimblettes become worn over time. They are considered disposable and sold in boxes. The surface is dimpled with the dimples inverted to provide better grip. Thimblettes are sized from 00 through to 3.

A finger cot is a smooth rubber &quot;glove finger&quot; used to protect the finger or the item being handled.

==Sewing palms==
A variation on the thimble used by sailmakers and leather workers is the sail palm, also known as &quot;sailor&#x27;s palm&quot; and &quot;sailmaker&#x27;s palm&quot;. There are two variations, &quot;seaming palm&quot; which is used for light work, such as sewing canvas together and &quot;roping palm&quot; which is built for heavier work, such as sewing canvas and rope together. This item consists of a pitted hard plate set into a stiff leather band that is worn around the palm of the hand, with the plate resting against the first joint of the thumb. It is used by grasping a needle between the thumb and indexing finger, with the eye end of the needle against the pitted plate, and pushing the needle with the entire arm. Most palms are hand specific to give the user a better fit. This design permits the sewer to exert a great amount of force when pushing thick needles through very tough materials such as sail cloth, canvas or leather. 

==Cultural references==
In the Parker Brothers board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;, first published in 1935, the thimble was one of the eight traditional metal game pieces used to mark a player&#x27;s position on the game board. However, this piece was replaced in new versions of the board game from August 2017 following public consultation.

In 2022, Hasbro again consulted the public on the removal of a current playing piece and the reintroduction of a previous one. The public voted for the return of the thimble, replacing the T-Rex.

==Auction records==
On December 3, 1979, a London dealer bid the sum of $18,000 USD for a dentil shaped Meissen porcelain thimble, circa 1740, at Christie&#x27;s auction in Geneva, Switzerland. The thimble, just over high, was painted in a rare lemon-yellow color about the band. It also had tiny harbor scene hand painted within gold-trimmed cartouches. The rim was scalloped with fired gold on its bottom edge. The thimble now belongs to a Meissen collector in Canada.

<text>Melpar was an American government contractor in the 20th century Cold War period. At a time when most employment in Washington, DC was directly by the US federal government, Melpar became an early private sector contracting company training a high technology workforce in the area.

==History==
In 1945, after the conclusion of World War II, the founders of Melpar Inc (Thomas Meloy and Joseph Parks), at the suggestion of the United States Navy, moved from New York City to the Washington, DC area to obtain government contracts.
Meloy had served as an assistant to Henry Stimson during the war. The company name was derived from the first syllable of their last names.
In late 1945 Parks accidentally killed himself in a hunting accident; nevertheless Meloy continued to promote developing Melpar as an engineering and production company doing business with the Armed forces. He acquired the Carl Miller Engineering Company, a small firm that designed and produced electro-mechanical products. The new company took over a contract for airborne radar systems, and expanded. In the next few years Melpar moved to Alexandria, Virginia, added a second plant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a third plant in Alexandria. Within 15 years the company grew to more than 6,000 employees, and occupied ten facilities of more than throughout Northern Virginia.

Events such as the Berlin Airlift, the detonation of the nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, and the outbreak of the Korean War helped Melpar&#x27;s business. In addition to military applications, technology began to play a role in nonmilitary areas. The US government had a pool of technical talent in its laboratories, and assumed an expanded role. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 further intensified competition with the Soviet Union.

Melpar embraced rather than shunned government work, as most other companies did. In 1951 Westinghouse Air Brake Company, a railway equipment producer founded in 1869, purchased the company for $1 million. It was a large sum for the time, despite typical profits on government contracts of only 1-2% of sales, which were generally reinvested in research.

In the 1990s, the development of the Internet, led to increased emphasis on computer science, information systems, and software technology. During the 1970s and 1980s, a similar fervor was experienced in the telecommunications and biotechnology sectors. However, during the 1950s and 1960s the most exciting technical place to advance the knowledge was the fledgling aerospace and electronics industry. The 1950-60s had many new firms and people readily working long hours. A unique feature of the 1950s, however, was that the US government, not the commercial marketplace, was the prime source of funding for new technologies.

Melpar was located near its customers in Washington, DC. Other government contractors such as Atlantic Research, Vitro Laboratories, Page Communications Engineers, Hazleton Laboratories (now Fortrea), COMSAT and the Applied Physics Laboratory also benefited. However, Melpar was the largest. In 1963, openings included astronomers, astrophysicists, microbiologists, entomologists, geophysicists and gas chromatographers. Melpar filled a void due to the lack of a technical university in the area (Melpar welcomed George Mason University in 1964).

In 1952 Melpar built an expensive, modern plant from downtown on a wooded tract near Seven Corners on Route 50.
The new building, surrounded by fields in a campus-like setting back from the road, had a pond, willow trees, a brick facade, and parking behind the plant. It was a contrast to the small buildings and warehouses located downtown, and was promoted as harmonizing industrial design with residential surroundings. To accommodate Melpar, Fairfax County revamped its zoning laws to help relieve the tax burden on property owners. Melpar employees could work near their homes. In development advertising the state of Virginia touted Melpar as a model.
The decision to move to the country was made more than ten years before the &quot;circumferential highway&quot; was completed, and more than 15 years before a shopping mall now known as Tysons Corner Center was built at Tyson&#x27;s Corner. Later known as the Capital Beltway, this highway led to the term beltway bandits for the contracting firms that later proliferated.

Melpar linked production facilities to its scientific and engineering capabilities. The company won two large contracts for B-58 aircraft electronics and Minuteman missile guidance components, requiring a buildup of manufacturing plants and an associated technical workforce in the Washington area. These facilities enabled scientists to test their laboratory research with prototype hardware. By 1960 the company assembled products such as missile equipment, flight simulators, radar beacons, fuses, data processing equipment, communications, antennas, electronic countermeasure and reconnaissance systems.

Managing manufacturing programs presented a different set of challenges. Since Washington did not have a workforce of electronic technicians Melpar had to build and train one. The Minuteman production line required 1,800 people and as many as 130 were hired in a single day. Technology schools such as the Capitol Radio Engineering Institute expanded to help train designers and draftsmen to build products for space and missile programs. Universities conducted technical courses in Melpar&#x27;s facilities for employees on their own time, in programs praised by the Secretary of Education. Melpar instituted tuition-reimbursement policies with incentives for high grades in technical courses. Positions for minorities and females opened at unprecedented levels.

During this time the company also pioneered manufacturing technology. Unlike today when existing commercial off-the-shelf technology is available, manufacturing had to translate ideas quickly into producible reality. Intense development occurred in areas of microelectronics technology such as the fabrication and layout of miniature circuits, and the use of thin film devices and plastic components. Processes such as welding, plating, soldering and automatic component insertion were studied and improved.
Melpar&#x27;s manufacturing engineers often found themselves writing engineering process documents that eventually became the government standard.

Melpar performed diverse research in physical and life sciences over 40 years. One project begun in the late 1950s (foreshadowing artificial intelligence) linked biology and the design of electrical devices–computer programs that emulated artificial nerve cells and simulated functions such as learning ability and initiative. The intent was to construct a thinking machine, similar to a human nervous system that learned pattern recognition and avoided mistakes (e.g. programming a mobile satellite on the Moon to avoid a deep precipice). Studies on the nature of speech led to more efficient use of the radio spectrum through bandwidth compression, and improved long distance and coded communications–other related studies focused on the elimination of speech deficiencies and development of a phonetic typewriter. In medical research Melpar developed synthetic materials (tissue growth) to be compatible with the heart (later known as the Jarvik heart), and produced an electronic heart monitor (Cardiac Sentry) which detected out-of-norm variations, maintained hospital records and administered prescribed treatments. The company was a pioneer in plasma physics and developed materials for communicating with crewed space vehicles reentering the atmosphere. Using solar energy, desalinization experiments were conducted to make saline and brackish water drinkable. Detection systems to measure highway curves, motions and vibrations were developed to improvemass transit systems.

Melpar performed studies in cell biology, food chemistry, composite materials (light weight, high temperature), solar energy, meteorology, virology and immunology (cancer research), air and water pollution, air traffic control, global navigation (constructed a prototype map of the Global Positioning System), and underwater acoustics and optics. They studied methane detection in mines and conversion of coal to acetylene as a new source of energy. An antenna was placed on top of the Empire State Building to evaluate the feasibility of UHF broadcasting. Offshoot products from laboratory technology included resins, varnishes, foam, nonsmudge ink, adhesives, photoelectric readers and frequency standard instrumentation. Synthetic diamonds and emeralds were produced to test hardness in space age materials. While most of Melpar&#x27;s efforts were technical, some involved the social sciences–creation of a stock index of S&amp;P 500 companies for Business Week, and operation of a Job Corps center.

Melpar continued its work on military and space applications such as radar, communications, and electronic countermeasure systems as well as airborne and ground intelligence systems. Devices to detect lethal chemical and biological agents were developed. The company participated in early uncrewed (Vanguard and Explorer) and crewed space programs (Mercury and Apollo), providing antennas and semi-dried food for lunar missions. A quarantine facility was produced to insure the astronauts had not brought any contamination from the Moon.

Melpar also produced more than a dozen flight simulators, including many for the Air Force&#x27;s century series fighters and helicopter systems for the Navy. These simulators enabled more realistic and demanding training, saving pilots&#x27; lives and reducing fuel consumption during the 1970s energy crisis.

A company newspaper editorial in 1957 stated, &quot;We have sought the breeder job, the line of inquiry promising to expand a general field of engineering endeavor or open a new one.&quot;

However, in the mid-1960s Melpar&#x27;s research, engineering and production began to decline. The government&#x27;s budget priorities changed, with emphasis placed on solving the nation&#x27;s social problems. The human spaceflight program had few follow-on missions after landing a man on the Moon. The military&#x27;s budget was heavily dedicated to the Vietnam War. These budget trends reduced Melpar&#x27;s programs.

Other factors contributed to the business decline. The government did not award follow-on manufacturing contracts, so layoffs of production workers took place. The American Standard Companies, bought the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, and immediately began to sell off the assets. Melpar&#x27;s research programs were diverse, unprofitable, and had uncertain business prospects.

Some unfavorable publicity contributed to Melpar&#x27;s misfortunes. In 1963 Bobby Baker was Secretary for the Majority Democratic caucus in the US Senate, and closely linked to Lyndon B. Johnson - he held perhaps the most powerful nonelected position in Congress. A Melpar vending machine contractor filed a lawsuit against Baker, accusing him of influence peddling to switch the contract to a competitor, with which he had financial ties. Within a few days Baker resigned his position. For almost two years there were headlines and congressional investigations into Baker&#x27;s business deals and questionable relationships. Melpar&#x27;s top management was called to testify before the Senate Rules committee, although ultimately the Melpar incident was settled out of court. Even so, the situation demoralized employees, did not enhance the company&#x27;s ability to win new Government contracts, and changes in company management soon took place.

An investigation was also ordered into overpricing of the B-58 systems.

Some employees left Melpar to start new companies (usually in the Washington area). Over the next 20 to 30 years more than a dozen spin-offs generated millions of dollars in annual sales and employed thousands in the Washington area. One employee began a communications company in Florida that ultimately became the Harris Corporation. 
Two employees from a research division near Boston formed the data communications manufacturer Codex Corporation in 1962. Many prospered in the 1970s and 1980s, but then left the area, due to industrial consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions. Meloy Laboratories continued Melpar&#x27;s biotechnical, pharmaceutical research until Rhône-Poulenc moved the operation to Philadelphia in the 1980s. A flight simulator spin-off named Simulation Engineering Corporation (Secor), went through four changes in ownership in Northern Virginia–from Sperry Rand to Honeywell to Hughes to Raytheon - before being moved to Texas in 1998. The same employees started a second company, Quintron, which was purchased by Loral for $22 million and later owned by Lockheed. A few companies still reside in Northern Virginia –VSE Inc in Alexandria (1300 employees), RSI Inc in Sterling (500 employees), ISOMET in Manassas, ST Research (now a division of Boeing called Argon ST) in Newington, as well as half a dozen small machine shops.

For almost 50 years Melpar used the same facility on U.S. Route 50 in Virginia and had about 1,500 employees. The company went through several changes in ownership, being purchased by LTV Electrosystems in 1970 (changed to E-Systems in 1972) and the Raytheon Company in 1995. The name Melpar was discontinued in 1994 and the facility served as headquarters for Raytheon&#x27;s Strategic Systems Division. Over the last 25 to 30 years the company performed some government electronics contracts, such as production and support of ground systems for the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Additionally this facility managed information systems for agencies such as the US Department of Education, and fabricated and tested electronic products.
In 2010 Raytheon moved out of the building at 7700 Arlington Boulevard, and it was remodeled for Tricare.

<doc id="520236" wikidata="Q1351972" url="?curid=520236" title="Frank O'Connor">
<text>Frank O&#x27;Connor (born Michael Francis O&#x27;Donovan; 17 September 1903 – 10 March 1966) was an Irish author and translator. He wrote poetry (original and translations from Irish), dramatic works, memoirs, journalistic columns and features on aspects of Irish culture and history, criticism, long and short fiction (novels and short stories), biography, and travel books. He is most widely known for his more than 150 short stories and for his memoirs. The Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award was named in his honour.

==Early life==
Raised in Cork, he was the only child of Minnie (née O&#x27;Connor) and Michael O&#x27;Donovan. He attended Saint Patrick&#x27;s School on Gardiner&#x27;s Hill. One teacher, Daniel Corkery, introduced O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s class to the Irish language and poetry and deeply influenced the young pupil. He later attended North Monastery Christian Brothers School.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s early life was marked by his father&#x27;s alcoholism, debt, and ill-treatment of his mother. His childhood was strongly shaped by his mother, who supplied much of the family&#x27;s income by cleaning houses, and his father was unable to keep steady employment due to alcoholism. O&#x27;Connor adored his mother and was bitterly resentful of his father. In his memoirs, he recalled his childhood as &quot;those terrible years&quot;, and admitted that he had never been able to forgive his father for his abuse of himself and his mother. When his mother was seventy, O&#x27;Connor was horrified to learn from his own doctor that she had suffered for years from chronic appendicitis, which she had endured with great stoicism, as she had never had the time nor the money to see a doctor.

==Irish nationalism==
In 1918 O&#x27;Connor joined the First Brigade of the Irish Republican Army and served in combat during the Irish War of Independence. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 and joined the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, working in a small propaganda unit in Cork City. He was one of twelve thousand Anti-Treaty combatants who were interned by the government of the new Irish Free State. (see 1923 Irish hunger strikes) In February 1923, O&#x27;Connor was imprisoned in Cork City Gaol and in April moved to Gormanston, County Meath where he was held until just before Christmas. War is a major theme in most stories of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first published collection, &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot;, 1931.

==Literary career==
Following his release from Gormanston, O&#x27;Connor took various positions including that of teacher of Irish and theatre director. Thanks to his continuing connection with Corkery, he was introduced to Lennox Robinson, then the secretary for the Carnegie Trust. Robinson was organizing rural libraries and engaged O&#x27;Connor as a trainee. O&#x27;Connor worked first in Sligo and later under Geoffrey Phibbs in Wicklow.

Through Phibbs, he met and was befriended by George William Russell (Æ), who requested O&#x27;Connor to send him material for publication. Russell introduced O&#x27;Connor to most of the well-known Irish writers of the day, including W. B. Yeats, F. R. Higgins and Augusta Gregory. In his memoirs, he paid tribute to both Yeats and Russell for the help and encouragement they gave him.

In December 1928, he moved to Dublin to take up the position of librarian at the Pembroke District Library.

In 1935, O&#x27;Connor became a member of the board of directors of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, founded by Yeats and other members of the Irish National Theatre Society. In 1937, he became managing director of the Abbey. Following Yeats&#x27;s death in 1939, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s long-standing conflict with other board members came to a head and he left the Abbey later that year.

In 1950, he accepted invitations to teach in the United States, where many of his short stories had been published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and won great acclaim. He spent much of the 1950s in the United States, although it was always his intention to return eventually to Ireland.

==Death==
O&#x27;Connor had a stroke while teaching at Stanford University in 1961, and he later died from a heart attack in Dublin, Ireland on 10 March 1966. He was buried in Deans Grange Cemetery on 12 March 1966.

==Family==
In 1939 O&#x27;Connor married Evelyn Bowen (who had previously been married to the actor Robert Speaight): they had two sons and a daughter. They were divorced in 1953. O&#x27;Connor married, secondly, Harriet Rich of Baltimore, whom he met while lecturing at Northwestern University. They had one daughter. Between his marriages to Bowen and Rich, he was romantically involved with Joan Knape, with whom he had a son, Oliver O&#x27;Donovan.

==Work==
O&#x27;Connor was perhaps best known for his varied and comprehensive short stories but also for his work as a literary critic, essayist, travel writer, translator and biographer. He was also a novelist, poet and dramatist.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s career began in 1922 and accelerated with the appearance of poetry in translation, articles on early Irish poets, book reviews by stories and original poetry. Much of this material appeared in Æ&#x27;s journal &quot;Irish Statesman&quot;.

From the early 1930s following the publication of his first volume of short stories, &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot; (1931), to his death in 1966 he was a prolific writer of short stories (c. 160), translations of a wide range of Irish poetry (c. 120), plays, both alone and in collaborations (c.10), novels (2) as well as works in non-fiction covering topics in literary criticism and theory, travel, Irish culture, and biography. His work as an Irish teacher complemented his plethora of translations into English of Irish poetry, including his initially banned translation of Brian Merriman&#x27;s &quot;Cúirt an Mheán Oíche&quot; (&quot;The Midnight Court&quot;). Many of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s writings were based on his own life experiences – notably his well-known &quot;The Man of the House&quot; in which he reveals childhood details concerning his early life in County Cork. The Sullivan family in this short story, like his own boyhood family, is lacking a proper father figure.

In other stories, his character Larry Delaney, in particular, is reminiscent of events in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s own life. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s experiences in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War are reflected in &quot;The Big Fellow&quot;, his biography of Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, published in 1937, and one of his best-known short stories, &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot; (1931), published in various forms during O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s lifetime and included in &quot;Frank O&#x27;Connor – Collected Stories&quot;, published in 1981.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s early years are recounted in &quot;An Only Child&quot; (1961), a memoir which has the immediacy of a precocious diary. U.S. President John F. Kennedy remarked anecdotally from &quot;An Only Child&quot; at the conclusion of his speech at the dedication of the Aerospace Medical Health Center in San Antonio on 21 November 1963: &quot;Frank O&#x27;Connor, the Irish writer, tells in one of his books how, as a boy, he and his friends would make their way across the countryside, and when they came to an orchard wall that seemed too high and too doubtful to try and too difficult to permit their voyage to continue, they took off their hats and tossed them over the wall—and then they had no choice but to follow them. This nation has tossed its cap over the wall of space and we have no choice but to follow it.&quot;

O&#x27;Connor continued his autobiography through his time with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, which ended in 1939, in his book, &quot;My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;, which was published in 1968, posthumously. It contains valuable character sketches of many of the leading Irish literary figures of the 1930s, in particular, Yeats and Russell (who wrote with the pseudonyms Æ and Æon).

==Frank O&#x27;Connor Festival and Prize==
Since 2000, The Munster Literature Centre in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s hometown of Cork has run a festival dedicated to the short story form in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s name. The longest-established annual festival dedicated to the short story form in an English-speaking country, it regularly hosts readings, workshops and masterclasses for contemporary practitioners of the form, as well as celebrating the work of O&#x27;Connor and other local short fiction writers such as Elizabeth Bowen, Seán Ó Faoláin and William Trevor.

The festival has hosted readings by: Richard Ford, Julia O&#x27;Faolain, James Lasdun, Alasdair Gray, Dan Rhodes, Eugene McCabe, Bernard MacLaverty, Desmond Hogan, James Plunkett, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Rebecca Miller, Anne Enright, Mike McCormack, Etgar Keret, Éilís Ní Dhuibhne, Cónal Creedon, Samrat Upadhyay, Philip Ó Ceallaigh, Rachel Sherman, David Marcus, Panos Karnezis, Nisha da Cunha, William Wall, Bret Anthony Johnston, David Means, Claire Keegan, Miranda July, Rick Moody, Jhumpa Lahiri, Yiyun Li, Julie Orringer, ZZ Packer, Simon Van Booy, Wells Tower, Charlotte Grimshaw and Kevin Barry among others. It also has a tradition of encouraging younger writers at the start of their career, Jon Boilard for example.

The Frank O&#x27;Connor International Short Story Award, is awarded to the best short fiction collection published in English anywhere in the world in the year preceding the festival. The prize is also open to translated works and in the event of a translation winning the prize is divided equally between author and translator. The award is described as &quot;the richest prize for the short story form&quot; and at €35,000 in 2010 is one of the most valuable literary prizes for any category of literature.

==In popular culture==
O’Connor&#x27;s short story &quot;Guests of the Nation&quot; has been the basis of several films. The story is set during the Irish War of Independence and chronicles the doomed friendship between the members of an I.R.A. unit and the two British Army hostages whom they are guarding. The first film was a silent one, directed in 1934 by Denis Johnston and featuring Barry Fitzgerald and Cyril Cusack. Neil Jordan&#x27;s award-winning film &quot;The Crying Game&quot; was inspired in part by this story.

<text>Trait ascription bias is the tendency for people to view &quot;themselves&quot; as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations. More specifically, it is a tendency to describe one&#x27;s own behaviour in terms of situational factors while preferring to describe another&#x27;s behaviour by ascribing fixed dispositions to their personality. This may occur because peoples&#x27; own internal states are more readily observable and available to them than those of others.

This attributional bias intuitively plays a role in the formation and maintenance of stereotypes and prejudice, combined with the negativity effect. However, trait ascription and trait-based models of personality remain contentious in modern psychology and social science research. Trait ascription bias refers to the situational and dispositional evaluation and description of personality traits on a personal level. A similar bias on the group level is called the outgroup homogeneity bias.

==Overview==
Trait ascription and the cognitive bias associated with it have been a topic of active research for more than three decades. Like many other cognitive biases, trait ascription bias is supported by a substantial body of experimental research and has been explained in terms of numerous theoretical frameworks originating in various disciplines. Among these frameworks are attribution theory (related to how people determine causes of observed events), theories of personality description such as the five factor model, and work regarding the circumstances under which personality assessments are valid. Seminal work includes Turner, Jones, Kammer, and Funder. Incorrectly ascribing traits to other persons based on limited information or observations intuitively plays a role in the formation and perpetuation of some social phenomena such as stereotypes and prejudice. As such, methods to mitigate the effect of trait ascription bias on personality assessments outside of the lab are also of interest to social scientists. Although trait-oriented theories of personality description, and indeed the very notion of universal, enduring traits themselves, have a natural appeal, some researchers are critical of their existence outside of the laboratory and present results which imply trait ascription, and consequently trait ascription bias, are simply residue of the methodologies historically used to &quot;detect&quot; them. Criticism is based either on the non-existence of personality traits (contrary to five factor descriptions), or suggest divergent interpretations of results and alternative mechanisms of ascription, limiting the scope of existing work.

==Evidence==
The empirical evidence supporting trait ascription and the psychological mechanisms underpinning it comes from a diverse body of research in psychology and the social sciences.

===The actor and the observer===
Jones and Nisbett were among the first to argue that people are biased in how they tend to ascribe traits and dispositions to others that they would not ascribe to themselves. Motivated by the classic example of the student explaining poor performance to a supervisor (in which the supervisor might superficially believe the student&#x27;s explanations but really thinks the performance is due to &quot;enduring qualities&quot;: lack of ability, laziness, ineptitude, etc.) their actor–observer asymmetry argument forms the basis of discourse on trait ascription bias.

===Kammer et al.===
In a 1982 study involving fifty-six undergraduate psychology students from the University of Bielefeld, Kammer et al. demonstrated that subjects rated their own variability on each of 20 trait terms to be considerably higher than their peers. Building on the earlier work of Jones and Nisbett, which suggests people describe the behaviour of others in terms of fixed dispositions while viewing their own behaviour as the dynamic product of complex situational factors, Kammer hypothesized that one&#x27;s own behaviours are judged to be less consistent (i.e. not as predictable) but of higher intensities (with regard to particular traits) than the behaviour of others. The experiment had each student describe themselves as well as a same-sex friend using two identical lists of trait-descriptive terms. For example, for the trait of dominance the student was first asked &quot;In general, how dominant are you?&quot; and then &quot;How much do you vary from one situation to another in how dominant you are?&quot; Kammer&#x27;s results strongly supported his hypothesis.

===The &quot;trait&quot; of ascribing traits===
David C. Funder&#x27;s work on the &quot;trait&quot; of ascribing personality traits investigates the psychology of individuals who tend not to grant others the variability (i.e. lack of predictability) they grant themselves, instead preferring to ascribe traits and infer dispositional explanations of behaviour. It had been generally established that people ascribe more traits to others than to themselves, known as the actor–observer asymmetry in attribution, but Funder&#x27;s hypothesis was that some individuals are more inclined to make dispositional trait attributions than others, regardless of who they are describing. In the experiment, sixty-three undergraduates filled out a series of questionnaires which asked them to describe themselves, their best friend, and an acquaintance. For each of twenty pairs of polar opposite trait terms (e.g. &quot;friendly—unfriendly&quot;) subjects either ranked the person on a discrete scale or chose &quot;depends on the situation&quot;, allowing the subject to &quot;not make a dispositional ascription.&quot; Based on third-party Q-Sort personality descriptions of the subjects, certain negative personality traits were correlated with those subjects who tended to ascribe dispositions to others, while traits such as &quot;charming&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, and &quot;sympathetic&quot; were associated with those who preferred not to ascribe traits. This result is consistent with the type of personality commonly associated with promoting stereotypes and prejudice.

==Theoretical basis==
While trait ascription bias has been described by empirical results from various disciplines, most notably psychology and social psychology, explaining the mechanism of the bias remains a contentious issue in the theory of personality description literature.

===The availability heuristic===
Tversky and Kahneman describe a cognitive heuristic that suggests people make judgments (including about other people&#x27;s personalities) on the basis of how easily examples of their (other people&#x27;s) behaviour come to mind. This would appear to be consistent with the arguments of Jones and Nisbett and the results observed by others which found that people ascribe fewer traits to friends than to acquaintances, and fewer still traits to themselves than to friends, implying ease of recall might be a factor.

===Attribution theory===
Attribution plays a role in how people understand and judge the causes of the behaviour of others, which in turn affects how they ascribe traits to others. &quot;Attributional&quot; theory is concerned with how people subsequently judge behavioural causes, which also bears relevance to trait ascription and related biases. In particular, attribution (and attributional) theory can help explain the mechanism by which individuals defer to ascribing dispositional traits vs. situational variability to observers.

===Big Five personality traits===
The big five personality traits (or five factor model) arguably provides a robust set of traits by which personalities can be accurately described. It supports the notion that there are cross-cultural, enduring traits which manifest in behaviour and can, if correctly ascribed to individuals, provide an actor with predictive power over an observer.

==Mitigation==
Trait ascription bias, regardless of the theoretical mechanisms underpinning it, intuitively plays a role in various social phenomenon observed in the wild. Stereotyping, attitudes of prejudice and the negativity effect, among others, involve ascribing dispositions (traits) to other people on the basis of little information, no information or simply &quot;gut instincts&quot;, which amounts to trait ascription bias. As such, some researchers are interested in mitigating cognitive biases to reduce their effects on society.

==Criticism==
Trait ascription bias has received criticism on a number of fronts. In particular, some have argued that trait ascription, and the notion of traits, are merely artefacts of methodology and that results contrary to conventional wisdom can be achieved with simple changes to the experimental designs used. Furthermore, the theoretical bases for trait ascription bias are criticized for failing to recognize constraints and &quot;questionable conceptual&quot; assumptions.

<text>Austin Stories is an American sitcom that aired on MTV from September 10, 1997 until January 7, 1998. It aired Wednesday nights at 10:30 pm. The show aired twelve episodes filmed on location in Austin, Texas.

An MTV search brought executives James Jones and Lisa Berger to Austin in 1994. Jones had previously produced &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; and Berger was vice-president and director of development at the network. MTV scouts were drawn to the city&#x27;s emerging comedy scene and noticed Laura House, Howard Kremer and Brad &quot;Chip&quot; Pope. They were all discovered at a showcase for MTV at the Laff Stop for professional comics. All three had to pull strings to get on the showcase as none of them had been paid for their comedy. House was a junior high journalism teacher when she was cast on the show. Both she and Brad &quot;Chip&quot; Pope were University of Texas graduates. Originally, the show was only guaranteed 13 episodes on the channel. In March 1997, MTV flew House, Kremer and Pope to Los Angeles to write two scripts in three days. &quot;Austin Stories&quot; was green-lighted on March 20, 1997, and they often spent 16-hour days working on the show with taping wrapping in November.

Their contract expired on May 8, 1998, and MTV extended it for three more weeks before permanently canceling the show on June 1, 1998.

==Response==
&quot;USA Today&quot; gave the show three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it, &quot;one of the season&#x27;s coolest, funniest and most genuinely offbeat treats.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Caryn James wrote, &quot;With its meandering style, and its sense of wry comic absurdities rather than yuck-it-up one-liners, the series owes almost everything to Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Slacker&quot; (including their shared Austin setting). What it hasn&#x27;t got from that film it owes to Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s work, especially &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot;. But instead of seeming derivative, &quot;Austin Stories&quot; comes across as a first-rate sequel, proof that this laid-back sensibility can thrive on television as well as in films.&quot;

<doc id="520243" wikidata="Q746262" url="?curid=520243" title="Scarba">
<text>Scarba () is an island, in Argyll and Bute, Scotland, just north of the much larger island of Jura. The island has not been permanently inhabited since the 1960s. 

Until his death in 2013 it was owned by Richard Hill, 7th Baron Sandys; its owner now is Shane Cadzow who farms Luing cattle on the nearby island of Luing and grazes some of the cattle on Scarba. Kilmory Lodge is used seasonally as a shooting lodge, the island having a flourishing herd of red deer.

The island&#x27;s name is from the Norse and may mean &quot;sharp, stony, hilly terrain&quot; or &quot;cormorant island&quot;.

==Description==
Scarba is not served by any public ferries, but access from Craobh Haven or Crinan Harbour is possible by arrangement with local boatmen. The rough summit ridge can be accessed from the harbour at the north end, from where a vehicle track leads up past Kilmory Lodge to a height of about 200 metres. After that, there are no paths or well defined routes, and the terrain becomes rough and boggy. The island rises steeply to a peak (Cruach Scarba) of . A cylindrical triangulation point marks the highest of several summits, which are surrounded by several small lochs.

== Geology ==
The western two-thirds of Scarba is formed from the Neoproterozoic aged coarse-grained quartzites of the Jura Quartzite Formation ascribed to the Islay Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Separated from these rocks by a north–south aligned geological fault, the bedrock of the eastern third is the Neoproterozoic Scarba Conglomerate Formation, and the subordinate Jura Slate Member belonging to the Easdale Subgroup of the Argyll Group. North-south aligned dykes of amphibolite are found throughout the Jura Quartzite whilst lamprophyre dykes of Siluro-Devonian age and basalt and micro-gabbro dykes forming part of the Palaeogene age ‘Mull Dyke Swarm’ cut through both the Quartzite in the west and the conglomerate in the east.

Raised marine deposits of sand and gravel occur on the northeast coast, a legacy of late Quaternary changes in relative sea-level. Peat deposits are common within the island&#x27;s interior.

==Corryvreckan==

Between Scarba and Jura lies the Gulf of Corryvreckan, known for its whirlpool. Writing in 1549, Dean Monro wrote of &quot;Skarbay&quot; that between it and &quot;Duray&quot;: 
Ther runnes ane streame, above the power of all sailing and rowing, with infinite dangers, callit Corybrekan. This stream is aught myle lang, quhilk may not be hantit bot be certain tyds. This Skarbay is four myles lange from the west to the eist, and an myle breadth, ane high rough yle, inhabit and manurit, with some woods in it.

Scarba and a few nearby islets (Lunga and the Garvellachs) are collectively the Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs National Scenic Area, one of 40 such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection by restricting certain forms of development.

<text>Apartment 2F, often written Apt. 2F, is a 1997 MTV sitcom, sketch comedy and stand-up television series about the escapades of Randy and Jason Sklar&#x27;s characters in New York City. The series aired from July 13 to November 1997.

==Cast==
The series included appearances by comedic actors, Amy Poehler, Stephen Colbert, Lewis Black, Bill Burr, Zach Galifianakis and Godfrey.

The writers included Randy &amp; Jason Sklar, Vito Viscomi, Mike Royce, Michael Lee, Brian Frazer, Eric Friedman and Katty Biscone.

==Reception==
Reviewing the first episode, Carole Horst of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine said the show is a &quot;wildly unfunny sitcom&quot; that &quot;looks more like a TV Land reject than an MTV-sanctioned production&quot;. She goes on to say that &quot;while exhibiting nice brotherly chemistry and comic timing&quot;, the Sklar brothers &quot;have transferred characters and bits from their New York stage shows to a boringly traditional sitcom setup&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; suggested that the Sklar brothers &quot;could be the Seinfelds of the late &#x27;90s&quot;.

<doc id="520249" wikidata="Q171543" url="?curid=520249" title="Ukyo Katayama">
<text>is a Japanese former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to .

Katayama participated in 97 Grands Prix, debuting at the 1992 South African Grand Prix, making him the sport&#x27;s most experienced Japanese driver. He scored a total of five championship points, all of them for the Tyrrell team in . Katayama also competed in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, finishing second overall and leading the GTP class. He has managed the Japanese continental cycling team Team UKYO since 2012.

==Biography==
Born in Tokyo, Katayama spent three years racing in France before returning home in 1988 to enter the Japanese F3000. He scored three podiums in 1990, and won the championship in 1991 with two wins and three second places.

===Formula One===
His sponsors, Japan Tobacco, arranged a Formula One seat for Katayama in with Cabin brand, with the Larrousse team. The car was unreliable and a distinct midfielder, with team-mate Bertrand Gachot getting the lion&#x27;s share of the team&#x27;s meagre resources. However, Katayama impressed by running in 5th at the Canadian GP until his engine blew, but was eventually left with a brace of 9th places as his best result.

Japan Tobacco managed to arrange a switch to Tyrrell for , but the team were at a low, with the interim 020C essentially three years old, and the new 021 proving uncompetitive. 10th place at the Hungarian GP was his best result.

 was to see a considerable turnaround for Tyrrell and Katayama. He impressed with the new 022, with three points-scoring finishes, a number of good qualifying performances, and generally being faster than his more experienced and acclaimed team-mate Mark Blundell. He was consistently a top-6 runner, but the car proved to be unreliable, leading him to 12 retirements, including the German GP, in which he was running 3rd before his throttle stuck open. However, in the four races that he did finish, he scored two 5th places, one 6th, and one 7th, good enough for 5 World Championship points.

After his 1994 performance, he was allegedly offered a contract with a top team for the 1995 season, but in Katayama&#x27;s words, &quot;he couldn&#x27;t sign it&quot;. It would later emerge that in 1994 he had been diagnosed with cancer in his back; while non-threatening, it was painful, and his Grand Prix commitments delayed treatment. Katayama did not announce this until he retired from Formula One, not wanting anyone&#x27;s sympathy to make excuses for him.

He stayed on with Tyrrell for the next two seasons, but suffered a loss of form, with two 7th places in high-attrition races his best results, thus scoring no points whilst being outpaced by rookie team-mate Mika Salo. At the 1996 Belgian Grand Prix he finished on the lead lap for the single time in his Formula One career. During these years he was highly disadvantaged by the regulation changes which led to higher cockpit sides, a response to the death of Ayrton Senna at the 1994 San Marino GP.

After leaving Tyrrell, his Mild Seven (another brand of Japan Tobacco) backing landed him a seat at Minardi, but they too were at a low ebb, and two 10th places were his best result. At his home Grand Prix, he emotionally announced his retirement from Formula One.

===After Formula One===

====As a racing driver====
Still popular in his homeland, Katayama has since dabbled in sportscars and GT racing, as well as his other love of mountaineering. One of his most notable performances post F1 was at the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans, when during the last hour, as he was lapping traffic and closing up to the leading BMW in his Toyota GT-One, shared with compatriots Keiichi Tsuchiya and Toshio Suzuki, his car suffered a tyre blowout and, while he managed to keep the car on the track, he was forced to slowly make his way around the track to return to the pits for a new set. In the process the GT-One lost the chance to contend with the BMW. The lone GT-One would come home 2nd overall. Still, the GT-One won the GTP class, although it was the only car in that class to actually finish the race.

In 2008, he was one of several retired F1 drivers to compete in the new Speedcar Series.

====As a team manager====
In year 2000, Katayama established Team UKYO motor sport team. The team originally participated in JGTC in 2001–2002 in the GT500 class in a collaboration with Cerumo, competing as the No. 33 team with Katayama and future team owner Masahiko Kondo as its drivers. The team left the series after the 2002 season before returning in 2011 to lead Goodsmile Racing&#x27;s GT300 program. Katayama led the team to three GT300 titles in 2011, 2014, and 2017.

The team also took part in the Dakar Rally in 2002-2005 and 2007.

Team UKYO is participating in the road bicycle racing as a UCI Continental cycling team starting from 2012.

====As a mountain climber====
Katayama is a lover of mountain climbing. He has often been climbing mountains since his F1 era.

In 2001 he climbed the world&#x27;s sixth-highest mountain, Cho Oyu. On December 1, 2006, it was reported that he had achieved his lifetime ambition of climbing Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world, after an unsuccessful attempt in 2004.

On December 18, 2009, it was reported that he had been missing whilst climbing Mount Fuji with two friends. Upon calling a police search and rescue team, they informed the police that one of their climbing party had died, and another was presumed to be dying. Eventually, Katayama was found alive while two fellow climbers were found dead.

As of the end of 2010, Katayama had summited six of the Seven Summits: Mont Blanc (climbed in 1996), Kilimanjaro (1998), Elbrus (1998), Denali (2008), Aconcagua (2009), and Vinson Massif (2010)

====Other sports====
He has been participating other sporting events as an official invitee, such as Honolulu Marathon and Honolulu Century Ride.

====Media appearances====
He is now a commentator of Formula One in Japan, for Fuji TV. He also co-hosts the motoring program &quot;Samurai Wheels&quot; for NHK World. In 1996 he was a guest judge on &quot;Iron Chef&quot;.

==Helmet==
Katayama&#x27;s helmet was blue with a red and white stripe crossing the rear area and going in the sides forming an oblique letter T, and a vertical red and white stripe going across the top (until the visor).

<doc id="520254" wikidata="Q6840176" url="?curid=520254" title="Microsoft ergonomic keyboards">
<text>Microsoft has designed and sold a variety of ergonomic keyboards for computers. The oldest is the Microsoft Natural Keyboard, released in 1994, the company&#x27;s first computer keyboard. The newest models are the Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard (2013), the Surface Ergonomic Keyboard (2016), and the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard (2019).

In January 2024, Microsoft announced that it would license the design and manufacturing of the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard and Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard to Incase, as part of an effort to focus more on its Surface-branded accessories. These products will be branded under the Incase name, but as designed by Microsoft.

==Models==

In general, ergonomic keyboards are designed to keep the user&#x27;s arms and wrists in a near-neutral position, which means the slant angle (the lateral rotation angle for the keys in each half relative to the axis of the home row in a conventional keyboard) is approximately 10 to 12.5°, the slope (the angle of the keytop surfaces starting from the front edge closer to the user towards the top of the keyboard, relative to a horizontal plane) is -7.5°, and the tent or gable angle of each half (the angle of the keytops from the center of the keyboard towards its left and right edges, relative to the horizontal desk surface) is 20 to 30°.

;Notes
===Natural Keyboard===

The first generation of the Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, named the &quot;Natural Keyboard&quot;, was released in September 1994, designed for Microsoft Windows 95 and Novell Netware. It was designed for Microsoft by Ziba Design with assistance and manufacturing by Key Tronic. The Microswitch division of Honeywell, which was responsible for that company&#x27;s keyboards and was acquired by Key Tronic in early 1994, is also credited with design input.

The keyboard uses a fixed-split design, with each half of the alphanumeric section separated, laterally rotated, and tilted upwards and down from the center of the keyboard. This key arrangement was ergonomically designed to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries associated with typing for long periods of time. Another innovation was the integrated wrist pad helping to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer and further reducing strain on the neck, arms and wrists.

This keyboard also introduced three new keys purposed for Microsoft&#x27;s upcoming operating system: two Windows logo keys () between the and keys on each side, and a key between the right Windows and Ctrl keys. The three Num Lock/Caps Lock/Scroll Lock status lights are arranged vertically between the two halves of the alphanumeric section.

Although it was not the first ergonomic keyboard, it was the first widely available sub-$100 offering. The keyboard gained popularity quickly, exceeding Microsoft&#x27;s forecast of 100,000 units sold by the end of 1994. Microsoft soon asked Key Tronic to ramp up production to 100,000 per month in 1995, and the Natural Keyboard sold over 600,000 per month at its peak. Over 3 million units had been sold by February 1998, when its successor, the Natural Keyboard Elite, was introduced.

As with most Microsoft keyboards, software (Microsoft IntelliType) is bundled with the keyboard for both Mac OS X and Windows, allowing users to customize the function keys and modify keys fairly extensively.

===Natural Keyboard Elite===

The Microsoft Natural Keyboard has had several upgrades and refreshes since its introduction. The first of these was the &quot;Natural Keyboard Elite&quot;, introduced in February 1998 at a retail price of . Like the original Natural Keyboard, the Elite was manufactured by Key Tronic, who also assisted in its development.

The Elite features a nonstandard layout of the six-key navigation/edit key cluster normally found above the cursor keys (/, /, and /). Another common criticism of the Elite is that the arrow keys&#x27; inverted-T layout has been changed into a cross-like layout, with left/right arrows keys side by side and up/down keys bracketing them from above and below, increasing the distance between the vertical keys. Another significant change was the keyboard&#x27;s adjustable feet. While the original Microsoft Natural Keyboard had feet in the front to generate reverse tilt, the Elite and its successors have their feet in the back. The Natural Keyboard Elite was manufactured in at least two different color schemes; white with black lettering and black with white lettering.

===Natural Keyboard Pro===

The third iteration was the &quot;Natural Keyboard Pro&quot;, introduced in June 1999 at a retail price of . The Natural Keyboard Pro restored the standard inverted-T layout of the cursor keys and six-key nav/edit cluster 2×3 layout, and added a row of program shortcut keys along the top edge of the keyboard (above  —  and the numeric keypad), including multimedia keys and power management keys. Vista and Windows 7 have the ability to customize shortcut key behavior without additional software when using the &quot;internet keyboard&quot; keyboard layout. Some other modern operating systems, such as FreeBSD and most Linux distributions, have comparable configuration options. The Natural Keyboard Pro also included an internal two-port USB hub, which was commonly used to connect other input devices such as a mouse or trackball, but this was dropped in subsequent iterations.

===Natural Multimedia Keyboard===

In September 2002, Microsoft introduced the redesigned &quot;Natural Multimedia Keyboard&quot; (sometimes styled as &quot;MultiMedia&quot;) at a retail price of . The Natural Multimedia Keyboard reworked the row of multimedia buttons and included the controversial F Lock feature, originally debuted in the Microsoft Office Keyboard. Another common criticism is that although the bunched arrow keys of previous generation has been fixed by returning to the standard inverted T layout, the six-key nav/edit cluster has been changed to a 2x3 vertical layout, with moved to the F-Lock function of , and key expanded to double height. On the Natural Multimedia Keyboard, the status indicator lights for Num lock, Scroll lock, and Caps lock were moved from between the banks of alphanumeric keys to a more traditional location above and to the right of the backspace key. The Natural Multimedia Keyboard was manufactured in at least three different color schemes, including white with blue accents, black with silver accents, and white with black accents.

===Wireless Optical Desktop Pro===
The &quot;Wireless Optical Desktop Pro&quot; was introduced alongside the Natural MultiMedia Keyboard in September 2002 at a retail price of , That Desktop bundle included a wireless version of that keyboard, a wireless optical mouse (sold separately as the &quot;Wireless Optical Mouse blue&quot;), a USB receiver, and an adapter to convert the USB plug to PS/2 for older systems. The finish of the mouse and keyboard were changed to black with silver accents, and the indicator lights (Num Lock/Caps Lock/Scroll Lock) were moved to the receiver rather than the keyboard to conserve power. Some products boxed and marketed with this name feature keyboards labeled &quot;Microsoft Wireless Natural MultiMedia Keyboard&quot; and included a wireless receiver that has both PS/2 and USB connectors.

===Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000===

In September 2005, Microsoft introduced the &quot;Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000&quot; at a retail price of . This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, including an integrated leatherette wrist rest, noticeably concave key banks, and a removable front stand to generate negative slope, which helps to straighten the wrist and allows the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys. The multimedia keys have again been redesigned, and the six-key nav/edit cluster has been fixed by returning to the standard 3×2 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to &quot;on&quot;, providing the original function key features rather than the new &quot;enhanced&quot; functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 has the indicator lights for Caps lock, etc. moved back to between the banks of keys, although they are now below the space bar, rather than above. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on, with less of the distinctive &quot;click clack&quot; noise that is common with older keyboards; as it is likely uses cheaper membrane key switches (as opposed to mechanical), which tend to be quieter but have twice as much travel before depression. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. The 4000 is available in two variants, Business and Retail. The exact differences are not known, although product descriptions imply that the packaging is different, and prices are often slightly higher for the Business edition.

===Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard===

In June 2007, Microsoft introduced the &quot;Natural Wireless Ergonomic Keyboard 7000&quot; as part of the Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 bundle, which includes the Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000 at a retail price of . The biggest difference between the 7000 and 4000 keyboards, aside from wireless functionality, is the position of the status lights (Num Lock, Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, and F Lock). On the Natural Ergonomic 4000, these lights are on the wrist rest, centered vertically under the spacebar. In their place, on the Natural Ergonomic 7000 keyboard, resides a single battery indicator light.

The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 comes with a USB wireless dongle that connects both the mouse and the keyboard. The attachment to elevate the front of the keyboard is separate in the box. The Natural Ergonomic Desktop 7000 bundle also comes with batteries, a very brief user guide, a disk containing the Microsoft Intellitype and Intellipoint software, and the Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000, which uses the same physical design as the Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 with a different radio frequency.

===Sculpt ergonomic keyboard===

Microsoft introduced the &quot;Sculpt Ergonomic&quot; keyboard in August 2013 as part of the Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop bundle with the Sculpt Ergonomic mouse at a retail price of . The keyboard was made available separately in &quot;Business&quot; packaging for .

The wireless keyboard uses a scissor-switch mechanism and features a detached number pad. The arrangement of the six-key nav/edit cluster is nonstandard, although the arrow keys are still laid out as an inverted-T. The Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard and mouse connect to the computer wirelessly using a 2.4 GHz radio through a proprietary USB dongle. The receiver and keyboard communicate using 128-bit AES encryption and are permanently paired at the factory. Because of this, the dongle cannot be replaced and must occupy a USB port; this feature has attracted criticism as a Bluetooth connection would free up a USB port and ensure the keyboard could still be used even if the dongle was misplaced. Microsoft state the proprietary wireless connection eliminates any delay in waking the computer. Rather than using feet to elevate the back of the keyboard, the Sculpt Ergonomic keyboard comes with a reverse-tilt riser that snaps on to the bottom front edge of the keyboard using magnets.

During development, the Sculpt keyboard was codenamed &quot;Manta Ray&quot; for its resemblance to the animal.

===Surface Ergonomic Keyboard===
The Microsoft &quot;Surface Ergonomic&quot; keyboard was announced in October 2016 at a retail price of , alongside other accessories for the Surface Studio.

The shape of the Surface Ergonomic keyboard is similar to the Sculpt, but the six-key navigation block returns to the standard two-row, three-column arrangement, and the number pad is integrated into right side of the Surface Ergonomic. The Surface is gray and the wrist pad is covered with Alcantara instead of the gloss black finish and vinyl wrist pad of the Sculpt. The Surface has also dropped the option to add the magnetic front riser for negative slope. In addition, the Surface Ergonomic is connected wirelessly over Bluetooth instead of using a proprietary dongle.

One reviewer noted the typing action of the Surface scissor switches was &quot;more satisfying with improved quality&quot; than the Sculpt. Paul Thurrott criticized the Surface Ergonomic keyboard for dropping the front riser option and the increased width, which extends the reach needed to use the mouse for right-handed users.

=== Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard ===
The &quot;Microsoft&quot; &quot;Ergonomic&quot; &quot;keyboard&quot; was introduced in 2019 and is the successor to the &quot;4000&quot; keyboard. Like the 4000, it is black, wired, contains three sections (from left to right, alphanumeric, navigation, and numeric keypad), and is not backlit. It loses the zoom toggle, the back/forward button under the spacebar, and the space under the function keys are gone. There is a retail version (LXM-00013) and a business version (LXN-0004) and their differences (aside from the $10 markup on the business version) are currently unknown, though there might only be a UK layout for the business version.

<text>Victor Nicolas Davis, CM (February 10, 1964 – November 13, 1989) was a Canadian Olympic and world champion swimmer who specialized in the breaststroke. He also enjoyed success in the individual medley and the butterfly.

==Biography==
Victor Davis was born in Guelph, Ontario. As a boy, Davis learned how to swim in the lakes around his home. He then joined the Guelph Marlin Aquatic Club at the age of 12.

During his career, Davis held several world records as the winner of 31 national titles and 16 medals in international competition. At the 1982 world championships in Guayaquil, Ecuador, he set his first world record while winning the gold medal in the 200-metre breaststroke.

At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, he won a silver medal in the 100-meter breaststroke event, then captured the gold medal in the 200-metre breaststroke, in the process establishing another world record. In recognition of his accomplishments, Davis was named Swimming Canada&#x27;s Athlete of the Year three times and the Canadian government made him a Member of the Order of Canada.

A star of Canada&#x27;s national swim team for nine years, he retired from competitive swimming in July 1989. He was voted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1985, and posthumously into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1990, and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1994.

==Death==

A few months after his retirement, on November 11, 1989, while outside a nightclub in the Montreal suburb of Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Davis was struck by a car driven by Glen Crossley, who fled the scene. Crossley told police he hit Davis while trying to avoid a juice bottle Davis threatened to throw at the vehicle and didn&#x27;t realize he made contact with the swimmer. However, other testimony showed that Davis was actually hit from behind and thrown in the air before hitting his head on a parked car and a street curb. Two days later, the 25-year-old swimmer died of a severe skull fracture as well as brain hemorrhage and spinal hemorrhage in hospital. In February 1992, Crossley was found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident and sentenced to ten months in prison, ultimately serving four months.

==Legacy==
Davis&#x27;s parents fulfilled his express wish that his organs be donated to help save the lives of others. The swimmer&#x27;s heart, liver, kidneys and corneas were transplanted.

Each year since his death, awards are made by the Victor Davis Memorial Fund to help young Canadian swimmers continue their education while training. Thirteen recipients of this award participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2002, Victor Davis was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame.

In Guelph, the city named the 50m swimming pool in honour of Victor Davis.

==Film==
Davis&#x27;s life, death and legacy were remembered in &quot;Victor&quot;, a two-hour biographical drama film that was written by the Canadian former swimmer Mark Lutz, who also appeared in the title role.

<text>The red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis) is a forest-dwelling marsupial living in the eastern coastal region of Australia between extreme south-east Queensland and central eastern New South Wales.

==Description==
A small species of macropod, it has a head and body length of 29–62 cm, a tail length of 27–51 cm and mean weight of 3.8 kg for females and 7.0 kg for males. Mainly crepuscular, the red-necked pademelon is very shy and generally inhabits temperate forests near grassland, hiding in the forests by day and emerging into the grasslands to graze in the dusk.

The red-necked pademelon is brown-grey with a cream underbelly and a red-tinted neck and shoulders. It breeds in the autumn and spring in northern Australia, and in the summer in southern Australia. Predators include the dingo and the red fox, however habitat destruction, particularly through land clearance, is currently the largest threat to the species. The red-necked pademelon is not currently listed as an endangered species.

This species is closely related to the red-legged pademelon.

<text>Belnahua is one of the Slate Islands, in the Firth of Lorn in Scotland, known for its deserted slate quarries. The bedrock that underpins its human history is part of the Scarba Conglomerate Formation and its value has been on record since the 16th century. Likely uninhabited before commercial quarrying commenced, under the control of the Stevenson family during the 19th century the population expanded to over 150 before the island was abandoned again in 1914.

Living on a remote island in the 19th century came with significant hardships and the lives of the quarry workers have been described in unflattering terms by modern commentators, one describing them as in effect &quot;slaves&quot;. Today, the ruined buildings and abandoned machinery lie amidst the water filled quarries and are home only to wildlife. There are very strong tidal streams in the area and this a potentially hazardous location for shipping. In 1936 the cargo vessel &quot;Helēna Faulbaums&quot; was wrecked on the island, with the loss of 15 lives.

==Geography==
Belnahua is in the council area of Argyll and Bute and lies west of Luing and east of Dùn Chonnuill in the Garvellachs. The island is roughly in extent. About southeast is the islet of Fladda, the lighthouse on which is a &quot;well-known sea-mark in the Sound of Luing&quot;.

The island has been considerably denuded by quarrying – a process sometimes described as having broken its back. Deep water-filled cuttings and the ruined slate workers cottages remain as a testament to this industry. There was a jetty to the east of the island, but it was worn away within the last quarter of the twentieth century.

Belnahua exists amongst sea lanes that have numerous islands and skerries that &quot;swarm like bees on a branch&quot; amongst the &quot;most treacherous seas and complicated channels of the west coast&quot; of Scotland, including the Gulf of Corryvreckan some to the south. The island is part of the Scarba, Lunga and the Garvellachs National Scenic Area.

== Geology ==
The bedrock of Belnahua is in large part a Neoproterozoic age slate, graphitic pelite referred to the Jura Slate Member of the Scarba Conglomerate Formation. The Jura Slates are also found along the east coasts of Scarba and of Jura to the south. Like the Easdale Slates found across the Sound of Luing these slates belong to the Easdale Subgroup of the Dalradian Argyll Group. Three NNW-SSE aligned tracts of metalimestone, assigned to the Ardrishaig Phyllite Formation, are identified in the southern half of Belnahua. A doleritic igneous dyke cuts through the centre of the island and is identified as part of the Mull Dyke Swarm of early Palaeogene age, associated with the central volcanic complex which developed in Mull. In common with other shoreline zones in the region, the relatively flat surface of the island is as a result of marine planation when relative sea levels were higher, the steep sides of the knoll in the west having formed as sea cliffs.

==History==
===Early times===
In the 7th century the Cenél Loairn kindred controlled what is today known as Lorn in the kingdom of Dalriada. From about the mid-9th century Belnahua would then have become part of the Norse Kingdom of the Isles. The first written reference to the island appears in the 1549 &quot;Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; by Donald Monro. He wrote of &quot;Belnachua&quot; or &quot;Belnachna&quot;; &quot;Narrest the Wolfiis iyle layes ane iyllane, callit in Erische Leid-Ellan-Belnachna, quharin ther is fair skailzie aneuche&quot;. In modern English this brief entry reads as &quot;Nearest the Wolf&#x27;s Iyle lies an island called in the Scottish Gaelic language &quot;Ellan-Belnachna&quot;, where there is good sufficiency of slate&quot;. Not all of the islands that Monro mentions have been identified and the location of &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Iyle&quot; or &quot;Ellan Madie&quot; is uncertain.

===Slate quarrying===

According to the &quot;Old Statistical Account&quot;, quarrying began on Belnahua in 1632. The island was probably uninhabited prior to that. By this time the island may have become part of the Netherlorn estates of the Breadalbane family (a branch of Clan Campbell). In 1730 Colin Campbell of Carwhin was appointed to oversee their estates in Netherlorn and was tasked with exploiting the area&#x27;s natural resources. Easdale slate had been used from as early as the 12th century using seasonal labour from the Ardmaddy estate. In 1745 Campbell created the Easdale Marble and Slate Company (later shortened to Easdale Slate Company) in order to place extractions from the area on a more commercial basis. At that point Easdale was producing 1 million slates per annum and as further quarries were opened this further increased the company&#x27;s production to 5 million per annum by 1800.

In the 1790s Belnahua was leased out by the landowners to the Stevenson brothers whose aim was to supply slate for the developing town of Oban. Cottages were constructed for the workers in the south east corner of the island and there was a school and company store. Virtually all the provisions had to be supplied from Luing, including drinking water. Rainwater was collected in reservoirs but it was used to power the steam engines that drove the quarries&#x27; pumps. By the early 19th century the Stevenson family were shipping slate from both Belnahua and Fladda to Campbeltown in Kintyre. Their lease was eventually passed on to the Shaw family of Luing who hired a quarry master that lived on a 2-storey house on the island. At the height of the activity there were 30 quarry workers and their families living there and a total population of over 150. With the commencement of World War I in 1914 quarry work ceased and the island was completely abandoned and it has been uninhabited ever since.

The Breadalbane estates were sold off in the 1930s and as of 2004 Belnahua was owned by the Carling family.

===Life on the island===
Living on a remote island in the 19th century came with hardships. Quarry workers sought employment from around Scotland, some arriving in an area where they would have had few friends or family to support them in times of difficulty. There is no protection from the wind and it can be a &quot;harsh and desolate&quot; location, especially in winter. One writer has gone so far as to suggest that although some islands can suggest a lifestyle of peace and tranquility, that Belnahua &quot;buffeted by the sea and the winds, overshadowed from the south by the lowering cliffs of Scarba, and dominated by the threatening deep maws of the slate quarries at its heart, could surely have engendered little more than tension, fear, agitation and anxiety.&quot;

Paul Murton took a similar view of the islanders&#x27; circumstances: &quot;They were paid poorly and forced to rent their homes and buy all their supplies from their feudal superior, the Campbell Marquis of Breadalbane, who kept the workforce in a state of permanent debt and poverty. Effectively, the people of Belnahua were slaves.&quot;

==Shipwrecks==

On 15 August 1900 the iron steamship &quot;Apollo&quot; ran aground on Bono Reef north of Belnahua. She was carrying a cargo of granite cobble stones from Aberdeen to Newport. The wreck lies in a gully some down amidst thick kelp.

The unladen Latvian vessel &quot;Helēna Faulbaums&quot; left the Mersey on 26 October 1936 en route for Blyth. Encountering a storm, she headed for the Firth of Lorn seeking shelter although the light load meant that the propeller was ineffective in the high seas. At 7pm her steering failed and captain ordered the anchors to be deployed but they could not hold in the deep waters. The radio operator sent out SOS messages but the storm had disrupted communications and the local coastguards could not make contact with the lifeboat station at Port Askaig. The lifeboat was finally launched when a message was broadcast by the BBC. There is an extensive drying reef to the north of Belnahua and at 10pm that night the &quot;Helēna Faulbaums&quot; struck it broadside and foundered, sinking within ten minutes with the loss of 15 lives including two 18-year-old boys. Four sailors managed to scramble ashore and were rescued the next day by the Islay lifeboat and taken to Crinan. The bodies of the other crew members were washed ashore on Luing. Seven of the perished were later buried in a widely attended ceremony in Cullipool cemetery on Luing, but the captain of the ship Nikolajs Cughauss was repatriated to Latvia by the wish of his brother. A small monument has also been built at the gravesite.

The wreck lies in of water. There are very strong tidal streams in the area and diving is only possible at slack water.

==Wildlife==
Otters and seals are regular visitors to the coast of Belnahua, the latter fishing for ling, saithe and cod which get trapped in the sea-flooded quarries at low tide. The only land mammal on the island is the field vole.

The soils are very poor in quality so horticultural options are &quot;limited or non-existent&quot; and the ruined buildings and abandoned machinery lie amidst &quot;waist high grasses&quot;. The aim of the Slate Islands Heritage Trust is to record the island&#x27;s history but otherwise leave it untouched.
