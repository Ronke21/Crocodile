<text>A Japanese kitchen knife is a type of kitchen knife used for food preparation. These knives come in many different varieties and are often made using traditional Japanese blacksmithing techniques. They can be made from stainless steel, or &quot;hagane&quot;, which is the same kind of steel used to make Japanese swords. Most knives are referred to as or the variation &quot;-bōchō&quot; in compound words (because of rendaku) but can have other names including . There are four general categories used to distinguish the Japanese knife designs: handle (Western vs. Japanese); blade grind (single bevel, &quot;kataba&quot; vs. double bevel, &quot;ryōba&quot;); steel (stainless vs. carbon); and construction (laminated vs. mono-steel).

== Handles ==
Western handles have a bolster and a full or partial tang. These handles are often heavier, but are smaller in volume and surface area than most Japanese handles. The scale materials are often synthetic or resin-cured wood and are non-porous. Chefs who prefer the feel of a Western handle enjoy a more handle-heavy balance and grip the handle closer to the blade. This allows for more weight in the cut. 

Japanese handles, on the other hand are often made of ho wood which is burned in and friction-fitted to a hidden tang. A metal collar or buffalo horn bolster caps the handle-blade junction and prevents any splitting. This allows easy installation and replacement. The wood is porous and fine-grained, which makes it less likely to split and retain its grip. 

More decorative woods, such as ebony, yew, cherry, or chestnut, may be made into handles, though they are heavier and often charred on the outside to improve grip and water resistance. If they are not cured well or properly cared for, these decorative woods will crack more easily when exposed to moisture. 

Pak, or Pakka wood is a laminated wood that as it is held in a synthetic resin it is waterproof and is not porous. It is used on less expensive knives commonly replacing either the buffalo horn bolster, or both the bolster and the handle. The most common wood variant is chestnut.

The most common cross-sectional shape is an octagon, which is made with a slight taper towards the blade. Another common shape is the D-shape, which is an oval handle with a ridge running along the same side as the edge bevel, (right side of handle for a right-handed knife). 

A chef who prefers a knife with more weight in the blade, their knife to be lighter overall, to have a larger handle, or one who wants to replace their knife handle more easily, will often turn to a Japanese handle.

== Blades ==
===Single bevel knives===

Traditionally, Japanese knives are single-bevel edged — &quot;kataba&quot; — and this remains the dominant style. These are the knives of the established traditional Japanese cuisine and were originally developed from the Chinese double-beveled knives. 

They have an &quot;omote&quot;, (an edge on the right for right-handers); a , (where the front bevel meets the flat of the blade face); and an &quot;urasuki&quot;, (a hollow backside that releases food). These knives are usually a little thicker at the spine and body than Japanese double bevels, but are thinner right behind the edge. While they leave a better surface finish, the produce must bend further because of the thickness of the blade. They are sharpened along the single bevel by applying pressure to both the and the edge. &quot;Honbazuke&quot; is the initial sharpening that forms a flat surface along the perimeter of the strengthening it. This practice also straightens the backside and lays a shape for future sharpening. The is sharpened much more than the in order to maintain the function of the single bevel. 

The blade tips vary in style across Japan. &quot;Kansai&quot;-style knives usually have pointed tip for vertical cuts, which helps in decorative tip work. &quot;Edo&quot;-style knives are typically shorter with a square tip used for horizontal cuts, rendering a more robust working knife. 

The standard Japanese knife set, essential to &quot;Washoku&quot; (和食 Japanese cuisine), includes the &quot;yanagi-ba&quot;, &quot;deba bōchō&quot;, and &quot;usuba bōchō&quot;. 

Single-bevelled knives include:
*Shobu-bōchō — — three main &quot;sashimi&quot; knifes:
**Yanagi-ba — — (lit: &quot;willow blade&quot;). The most popular knife for cutting fish, also known as &quot;shobu-bōchō&quot; (&quot;sashimi&quot; knife). It is used to highlight different textures of fish in their techniques: &quot;hirazukuri&quot; to pull cut vertically, &quot;usuzukuri&quot; to pull cut thin vertically, and &quot;sogizukuri&quot; to pull cut at an angle. It is used to skin and sometimes scale and de-bone certain fish (for instance salmon). &quot;Yanagi-ba&quot; have angled tips and are generally heavier and have less sloping. The general blade size is from .
**Tako-hiki — (literally: &quot;octopus cutter&quot;) A regional variant of the &quot;yanagi-ba&quot; from Tokyo, that is lighter, thinner, flatter, and shallower in blade height with a square tip than &quot;yanagi-ba&quot; to allow easier cutting through dense flesh such as that of an octopus. 
**Fugu-hiki — (lit: &quot;pufferfish cutter&quot;) Another regional variant of the &quot;yanagi-ba&quot;, with a thinner blade and a round tip, that is for the very careful preparation of poisonous fugu. 
*Deba — — (lit: &#x27;pointed carver&#x27;). Thick knives with a broad slightly rounded arrow shape blade, to cut through resilient fish flesh for fillet and to cut through rib bones, behind the head, and through the head. Typically, they are between thick depending on size. They include &quot;hon-deba&quot; (lit: &quot;true &quot;deba&quot;&quot;); &quot;ko-deba&quot; (&quot;small &quot;deba&quot;&quot;); (for &quot;aji&quot;); (a smaller, more pointed form for use on boats); &quot;mioroshi deba&quot; (a hybrid between &quot;deba&quot; and &quot;yanagi-ba&quot; that are intermediate in thickness, weight, and length); and &quot;yo-deba&quot; (lit: &quot;Western-styled &quot;deba&quot;&quot;). The smaller sizes are less thick, allowing the knife to move through flesh easily, and are much more nimble. They are still much thinner behind the edge and more fragile than a Western butchering knife. The general blade size is from .
*Usuba — — (lit: &#x27;thin blade&#x27;) It is the thinnest of the three general knife shapes, which utilizes a flat edge profile. A vegetable cleaver similar in shape profile to the double-bevel &quot;nakiri&quot; as well as usage. It is used for push cutting, &quot;katsuramuki&quot; (rotary cutting of thin sheets) and (cutting thin strips from those sheets). There are regional &quot;edo-usuba&quot; (square tip) and &quot;kamagata-usuba&quot; (sheep&#x27;s foot tip) variants. The general blade size range is from .
* Mukimono — Used along with &quot;usuba&quot; for vegetables and it has an angled tip for decorative vegetable cutting. The general blade size range is from .
* Kirit-suke — A large hybrid with the length of &quot;yanagi-ba&quot; and the blade height and profile of &quot;usuba&quot; with an angled tip as a compromise. It requires great knife control because of the height, length, and flatness. The general blade size range is from to . 
* Hone-suki — A small triangular knife used to debone chicken. Most have an angled tip to slip between tendons and cut them. The general blade size range is from 
* Gara-suki — A thicker version of the &quot;hone-suki&quot;, capable of cutting through chicken bones. 
* Hamo-kiri — (lit: pike conger cutter). It is a knife intermediate in thickness and length between &quot;deba&quot; and &quot;yanagi-ba&quot; to cut the thin bones and flesh of pike conger. The general blade size range is from to .

*Unagi-saki — — (lit: &quot;eel cutting knife&quot;) This knife comes in style variants from Kanto, Kyoto, Nagoya, and Kyushu.

*Soba-kiri — (lit: &quot;soba&quot; cutter). A large oblong knife for cutting noodles, with a &quot;udon-kiri&quot; (udon cutter) variant. The general blade size range is from to .

*Mochi-kiri — (lit: &quot;mochi&quot; cutter). Used in preparation of &quot;mochi&quot; (Japanese rice cake) and comes in double-handle or single-handle variants.

*Maguro-kiri — (lit: tuna cutter). It is used to cut perpendicular (shorter) or parallel (longer and more flexible) to the very large Pacific blue-fin tuna and is sized accordingly. The general blade size range is from , so these are not normally found in domestic kitchens.

===Double bevel knives===
Japan adopted French and German cutlery ideas during the Meiji period in the late 19th century, integrating them into Japanese cutting techniques and culture. Japanese knives are often flatter and lighter than their European counterparts. 
Traditional Western knives are made with a double bevel — &quot;ryoba&quot; — which tapers symmetrically to the cutting edge on each side. Single bevel knives, &quot;kataba&quot;, which only taper to one side (typically the right), can require more care and expertise when both using and in sharpening. 

Double-bevelled knives include:
*Gyūtō bōchō — — (lit: &quot;beef-knife&quot;). This is the Japanese word, for a regular Western chef&#x27;s knife, used outside of Japan, for the Japanese versions of the knife type. Used for professional Western cuisine. When preparing vegetables, it is used in the form of chopping or thrust-cutting near the heel of the knife. The &quot;gyuto&quot; is used to rock-chop stiffer produce and to make fine cuts at the tip of the knife. It is used for many different cuts of meat. For larger cuts it is used to saw back and forth. It is used to pull-cut softer meats and push-cut more muscular cuts of meat. There is usually a slope from the heel of the knife to the tip, causing the wrist to point down and the shoulder to raise when cutting. The blade size ranges from to , with a shorter blade being more nimble, a longer blade giving more slicing power, and an intermediate length as a compromise for general use.
*Santoku — — (lit: &quot;3 virtues&quot;). This is often translated as &quot;three&quot; (&quot;san&quot;) &quot;virtues&quot;, or often (and probably more relevant for English speakers): &quot;three-uses/purposes&quot; derived in the 1940s from the best traits of three other Japanese knives: the &quot;deba&quot;, &quot;nakiri&quot;, and &quot;gyūtō&quot;. As a general multi-purpose utility kitchen knife, the santoku can be used for cutting meat, fish, and/or vegetables, against the more specialized knives such as the &quot;hankotsu&quot;, &quot;usuba&quot;, &quot;yaniga-ba&quot; etc. being designed for just one task. These knives are generally flatter than &quot;gyuto&quot; knives and have a less pointy tip, instead having a rounded down-turned tip, (i.e. a sheep&#x27;s foot). Since they are flatter, the wrist is in a more natural position and the shoulder does not need to be raised as high. These knives do not require as much room to cut. These are the most popular knives in most Japanese homes. The general size ranges from .
*Bunka bōchō — — (lit: &quot;cultural kitchen knife&quot;). This knife is a variant of the &quot;santoku&quot;, but instead of the sheep&#x27;s foot tip, it has a &quot;k-tip&quot;, also called a &quot;reverse tanto&quot;.

*Nakiri — — (lit: &quot;vegetable cutter&quot;). The square tip makes the knife feel more robust and secure than the pointed tip of the &quot;santoku&quot; or &quot;gyuto&quot;, which allows it to cut dense products at the tip. This knife has a flat edge. Some varieties of a &quot;nakiri&quot; have a slightly tilted blade profile towards the handle. This makes the grip more comfortable, causing the hand tilt up slightly and enabling one to use strength from their forearm when cutting. The general size ranges from .
*Petty — The Japanese equivalent of a paring knife or utility knife. This is a smaller knife for paring or for smaller produce, often used to accompany the &quot;gyuto&quot;. The general sizes range from .
*Suji-hiki — — (lit: &quot;muscle/sinews puller&quot;). These are long knives used to cut meat, often in the form of a draw cut. The general sizes range from to .
*Hankotsu — (lit: &quot;rebelious&quot;). This is a boning butchering knife used for cattle to cut hanging meat from the bone with a pointed tip and a short height which allows the user to turn to cut along bone, connective tissue or fat. The general size is .
*Katsuobushi-kiri — — (lit: &quot;bonito-cutter&quot;). This knife is used to slice thin scales of bonito or skipjack tuna &quot;(katsuobushi)&quot; in preparation to use it as an ingredient in many dishes. The blade is short, about in length and resembles a wood-carving knife.
*Chuka bōchō — — (lit: &quot;China kitchen knife&quot;). Commonly known as the Chinese chef’s knife, the &quot;chuka bōchō&quot; has a short handle, flat profile, and a tall blade used to gain mechanical advantage. The blade is usually thicker behind the edge to cut denser ingredients. Though sometimes called a &quot;Chinese cleaver&quot;, they typically cannot cut through bones.

== Steel ==
The defining qualities or characteristics of the metal of Japanese kitchen knives are: 
* &quot;toughness&quot; — resistance to breaking 
* &quot;sharpness&quot; — smallest carbide and grain for smallest apex reduce force in cutting
* &quot;edge life&quot; — an index for the length of time an edge will cut based on lack of edge rolling or chipping
* &quot;edge quality&quot; — toothy with large carbides or refined with small carbides
* &quot;ease of sharpening&quot; — steel easily abrades on stone and forms a sharp edge

Although each steel has its own chemical and structural limits and characteristics, the heat treatment and processing can bring out traits both inherent to the steel and like its opposite counterparts.

Carbon steel is generally harder and sharper, but is more brittle, less tough, and corrodes more easily, (usually with a dulling and blackening of the metallic patina). 
* White steel — purified from phosphorus and sulfur and unalloyed with variants 1, 2, and 3 (from higher to lower carbon) 
* Blue &quot;mokumegane&quot; steel — purified and alloyed with chromium and tungsten for edge life and toughness with variants 1 and 2
* Super-blue steel — blue steel alloyed with molybdenum and vanadium and more carbon for longer edge life, but are a little more brittle

Stainless steel is generally tougher and less likely to chip, but are more difficult to hone and so can be less sharp than carbon steel. In the highest quality though, it retains an edge longer and the grain structure is similarly sized in its carbides to carbon steel. Variants include:
* Powdered steel — with large carbides broken up by powdering process and sintered together under high pressure and temperature
* Semi-stainless steel — with less chromium that prevents rust of the iron and intermediate properties between carbon and stainless steel
* Tool steel — heavily alloyed that may or may not be stainless

==Construction==
Mono-steel blades are usually harder to sharpen and thinner than laminated blades. Three kinds of mono-steel blades are: 
*&quot;Zenko&quot; — stamped out 
*&quot;Honyaki&quot; — forged down from carbon steel with differential hardening
*Forged down from a billet without differential hardening

Laminated blades come in 3 different types: 
*&quot;awase&quot; — meaning &#x27;mixed&#x27;, for mixed steel
*&quot;kasumi&quot; — meaning &#x27;misty&#x27;, referring to the misty look of iron after sharpening
*&quot;hon-kasumi&quot; — higher quality &quot;kasumi&quot; 

Forming a laminated blade involves two or more pieces of steel, the &quot;jigane&quot; / &quot;shigane&quot; and the &quot;hagane&quot; / &quot;tamahagane&quot;. The &quot;jigane&quot; refers to soft cladding or skin of stainless steel, and &quot;hagane&quot; refers to hard cutting carbon steel core. There is sometimes an intermediate &quot;kawagane&quot; layer of a medium steel. This combination of metals makes laminated blades corrosion-resistant with the stainless steel, and strong with the high carbon steel. Blade construction with stainless steel cladding over a carbon steel core is less common due to manufacturing difficulty. The &quot;jigane&quot; allows for a tougher, more robust knife by absorbing shocks but can still be easily sharpened. It also allows for the &quot;hagane&quot; harder without making the whole blade fragile. The two forms of laminated blades are:
*&quot;Ni-mai&quot; — &quot;jigane&quot; spine with &quot;hagane&quot; blade edge
*&quot;San-mai&quot; — &quot;hagane&quot; sandwiched between &quot;jigane&quot;

A variation on the traditional laminated blade style is to form an artistic pattern in the &quot;jigane&quot;; patterns include:
*&quot;Suminagashi&quot;
*Damascus&quot;
*&quot;Kitaeji&quot;
*&quot;Mokume-gane&quot;
*&quot;Watetsu&quot;

==Production==

A great deal of high-quality Japanese cutlery originates from Sakai in Osaka Prefecture, the principal city of Japanese sword-smithing since the 14th century. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the samurai were banned from carrying swords as part of an attempt to modernize Japan. Though a demand for military swords remained and some sword-smiths still produced traditional samurai swords as art, the majority of sword-smiths refocused their skill to cutlery production, following the cultural shift.

The production of steel knives in Sakai began in the 16th century, when tobacco was introduced to Japan by the Portuguese and Sakai craftsmen started to make knives for cutting tobacco. The Sakai knife industry received a major boost from the Tokugawa shogunate (1603–1868), which granted Sakai a special seal of approval and enhanced its reputation for quality.

Today, Seki in Gifu Prefecture is considered the home of modern Japanese kitchen cutlery. Many major cutlery-making companies are based in Seki, producing kitchen knives in both the traditional Japanese style and western styles, such as the &quot;gyuto&quot; and the &quot;santoku&quot;. Knives and swords are so integral to the city that it is home to the Seki Cutlery Association, the Seki Swordsmith Museum, the Seki Outdoor Knife Show, the October Cutlery Festival, and the Cutlery Hall. Most manufacturers are small family businesses where craftsmanship is more important than volume, and they typically produce fewer than a dozen knives per day.

==Design and use==

Since the end of World War II, western-style, double-beveled knives have gained popularity in Japan. One example of this transition is the , an adaptation of . Other knives that have become widely used in Japan are the French chef&#x27;s knife and the , roughly analogous to a western carving knife. While these knives are usually sharpened symmetrically on both sides, their blades are still given Japanese-style acute-angle cutting edges of 8-10 degrees per side with a very hard temper to increase cutting ability.

Generally, a typical Japanese kitchen will have at least a basic range of:
* a traditional set of three single-bevelled knives: 
**&quot;deba&quot; (fish preparation knife)
**&quot;usuba&quot; (or else a double-bevelled &quot;nakiri&quot; — vegetable chopper)
**&quot;yanagi-ba&quot; (or else a double-bevelled &quot;suji-hiki&quot; — slicer)
* a petty knife (kitchen utility / parer)
* a generalist multi-purpose &quot;santoku&quot; 
* a larger generalist &quot;gyuto bocho&quot; (chef’s knife)
* a single-bevelled &quot;hone-suki&quot; or a double-bevelled &quot;hankotsu&quot; (boning knife)

Most professional Japanese cooks own their personal set of knives. After sharpening a carbon-steel knife in the evening after use, the user may let the knife &quot;rest&quot; for a day to restore its patina and remove any metallic odor or taste that might otherwise be passed on to the food. Some cooks choose to own two sets of knives for this reason. 

Japanese knives feature subtle variations on the chisel grind. Usually, the back side of the blade (i.e. the left side, for a right-handed user) is concave to reduce drag and adhesion so the food separates more cleanly (this concave feature is known as ). The , used for cutting crab and other shellfish, has the grind on the opposite side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell.

<text>Bamboo steamers, called zhēnglóng () in Chinese, are a type of food steamer made of bamboo. They are used commonly in Chinese cuisine, especially dim sum, and usually come in two or more layers. Bamboo steamers have also spread to other East Asian and Southeast Asian countries.

== History ==
From the Neolithic period, ceramic steamers known as &quot;yan&quot; have been found at the Banpo site, dating to 5000 BC. In the lower Yangzi River, &quot;zeng&quot; pots first appeared in the Hemudu culture (5000–4500 BC) and Liangzhu culture (3200–2000 BC) and were used to steam rice. 

The &quot;zhenglong&quot; in its current form originated in Southern China during the Han dynasty, possibly around Guangdong. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu, general Han Xin is said to have used bamboo and wood to make cooking utensils, and steam to cook food, in order to avoid filling the barracks with smoke. Steaming was used to cook dried foods, which were easier to store and preserve. An Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 AD) kitchen mural depicted in Dahuting Tomb No.1 in Mi County, Henan Province, is the earliest evidence of the origin of modern steamers.

Bamboo steamers are commonly used in Cantonese cuisine, such as for dim sum. They are also known in the Western world for its role in cooking and serving dim sum particularly during the practice of &quot;yum cha&quot;.

== Construction ==

Steamers are produced by removing the skin from the bamboo, soaking it in water, shaping it into a circle, and hammering it in with nails. The base is made up of woven bamboo strips, and production can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours depending on its size. Each layer has holes on the bottom for steam to rise up. Finally a lid is made to keep the steam in during cooking.

Most steamers are designed to be stacked on top of each other so that the steam can cook multiple servings simultaneously, as well as fit on the table (often on a Lazy Susan) while being served.

In recent years, alternatives to bamboo have been developed, including silicone.

<doc id="519668" wikidata="Q945999" url="?curid=519668" title="Trema (plant)">
<text>Trema is a genus of evergreen trees closely related to the hackberries (&quot;Celtis&quot;), occurring in subtropical and tropical regions of southern Asia, northern Australasia, Africa, South and Central America, and parts of North America. They are generally small trees, reaching tall.

==Taxonomy==
Previously included either in the elm family, Ulmaceae, or with &quot;Celtis&quot; in the Celtidaceae, genetic analysis has shown the Celtidaceae are best placed in the hemp family, Cannabaceae.

==Description==
The leaves are alternate, simple, long, ovate-acuminate to lanceolate with a long pointed tip, and evenly serrated margins. The fruit is a small drupe in diameter.

==Species associations==
&quot;Trema&quot; species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genera &quot;Aenetus&quot;, including &quot;A. splendens&quot;, which burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down, and &quot;Endoclita&quot;, including &quot;E. malabaricus&quot;.

Some &quot;Trema&quot; species unusually able to live in symbiosis with rhizobia for nitrogen fixation as a non-legume. In this case it is customary to mention these species as a separate genus &quot;Parasponia&quot;.

==Uses==
&quot;Trema orientale&quot; is widely planted for land reclamation in southern Asia, valued for its tolerance of poor soils due to its ability to fix nitrogen. It is also an invasive species on some Pacific Ocean islands.

==Species==
&quot;Trema&quot; comprises the following species:

# &quot;Trema andersonii&quot; 
# &quot;Trema angustifolium&quot; 
# &quot;Trema cannabina&quot; – type species - Lesser trema (many synonyms including &quot;T. vieillardii&quot; )
# &quot;Trema cubense&quot; 
# &quot;Trema discolor&quot; 
# &quot;Trema domingense&quot; 
# &quot;Trema eurhynchum&quot; 
# &quot;Trema humbertii&quot; 
# &quot;Trema lamarckianum&quot; – West Indian trema, Lamarck&#x27;s trema
# &quot;Trema levigatum&quot; 
# &quot;Trema melastomatifolium&quot; 
# &quot;Trema micranthum&quot; – Jamaican nettle tree
# &quot;Trema nitidum&quot; 
# &quot;Trema orientale&quot; – Pigeon wood (synonym &quot;T. affinis&quot; , &quot;T. orientalis&quot;)
# &quot;Trema parviflorum&quot; 
# &quot;Trema politoria&quot; 
# &quot;Trema simulans&quot; 
# &quot;Trema tomentosum&quot; – Poison peach
## var. &quot;tomentosum&quot; 
## var. &quot;viride&quot; – eastern Australia (synonym &quot;T. asperum&quot; )

<text>Nakiri bōchō (菜切り包丁, translation: knife for cutting greens) and usuba bōchō (薄刃包丁 — lit. &quot;thin knife&quot;) are Japanese-style vegetable knives. They differ from the &quot;deba bōchō&quot; in their shape, as they have a straight blade edge, with no or virtually no curve, suitable for cutting all the way to the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push. These knives are also much thinner. While the &quot;deba&quot; is a thick blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the vegetable slice. The &quot;nakiri&quot; and the &quot;usuba&quot; have much thinner blades. This does not help with cutting small bones in fish or meat, but is useful for cutting vegetables.

&quot;Nakiri bōchō&quot; are knives for home use, and sometimes have a &quot;Kurouchi&quot; black-finished blade. The cutting edge is sharpened with a double bevelled, (from both sides), called &quot;ryōba&quot; in Japanese. This makes it easier to cut straight slices. A &quot;nakiri&quot; blade is generally between long.

There are regional differences to the style of the knife tip with a sheep&#x27;s foot drop tip on knives from Osaka, whereas the dominant style from Tokyo is for a squared tip giving a cleaver-like appearance — as seen in the second image.

&quot;Usuba bōchō&quot; are vegetable knives used by professionals. They differ from the &quot;nakiri bōchō&quot; in the shape of the cutting edge. While the &quot;nakiri&quot; is sharpened from both sides, the &quot;usuba&quot; is sharpened only a single-bevelled edge, a style known as &quot;kataba&quot; in Japanese. The highest quality &quot;kataba&quot; blades have a slight depression — &quot;urasuki&quot; — on the flat side, which gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the &quot;ryōba&quot; used for &quot;nakiri&quot;, but requires more skill to use. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right-hand use of the knife, but knives sharpened on the left side are available for left-hand use. The &quot;usuba&quot; is heavier than a &quot;nakiri&quot;, although still much lighter than a &quot;deba&quot;.

<doc id="519670" wikidata="Q7109016" url="?curid=519670" title="Otoshi buta">
<text>Otoshi buta (, literally: drop-lid) are Japanese-style drop-lids for use in Japanese cooking. These round lids float on top of the liquid in a pot while simmering foods. They ensure that the heat is evenly distributed and reduce the tendency of liquid to boil with large bubbles. This reduces the mechanical stress on the food and keeps fragile ingredients in their original shape.

Otoshi buta are almost always made from wood, so they have to be soaked in water for a few minutes before use to avoid absorbing the flavor of the dish and disturbing the flavor of the next dish cooked using the &quot;otoshi buta&quot;. After use, the &quot;otoshi buta&quot; is washed and dried completely before storing.

Though it depends on the recipe and food being cooked, &quot;otoshi buta&quot; may be substituted with a sheet of tough cooking paper or aluminum foil.

<text>Yanagi-ba-bōchō (柳刃包丁, literally willow blade knife), Yanagiba, or yanagi, is a long and thin knife used in the Japanese cuisine. It is the typical example of the &quot;sashimibōchō&quot; (Japanese: 刺身包丁, sashimi [raw fish] bōchō [knife]) used to slice fish for &quot;sashimi&quot; and &quot;nigirizushi.&quot;

When preparing &quot;sashimi&quot; and &quot;nigirizushi&quot;, the goal is usually to have cut surfaces that are smooth, shiny, and even in order to maximize the taste. The construction of a &quot;yanagiba&quot; is designed for this purpose.

* Length: The long blade allows the user to cut a block of flesh in a single stroke. This prevents zigzag cutting, which creates a serrated cross section.
* Thinness: The blade is very thin behind the edge which allows the cut to be made using primarily the weight of the knife. Greater force or thickness would result in tearing or bruising of the flesh.
* Nonstick properties: The back face (&quot;urasuki&quot;) is concave to easily detach the blade from the substance being cut, and the front bevel (&quot;shinogi&quot;) allows the sliced piece to be easily removed from the blade after cutting.
* Steel properties: The &quot;yanagiba&quot; is crafted using techniques from those of the Japanese sword adapted to modern requirements. The blade is constructed from soft iron, which allows general toughness of the blade and ease of sharpening, laminated to high carbon steel, which gives hardness on the cutting edge and sharpness. The steel is typically Hitachi blue or white steel.
* Single ground: For right-hand use, the &quot;yanagiba&quot; has a bevel on the right side and is concave on the left. This allows a more acute angle compared to most double bevel knives and nonstick properties.
* Cutting direction: While almost all western knives are used to push and cut, the &quot;yanagiba&quot; is used pull and cut instead.

The first two characteristics are particularly for &quot;yanagi-ba-bocho&quot;, and its name &#x27;yanagi&#x27; is from long and pliant characteristics of a willow branch. The other characteristics are shared by all knives in Japanese cuisine.
The important principle in using a &quot;yanagiba&quot; to prepare &quot;sashimi&quot; is not cutting down but &quot;pulling&quot; with its long blade in a single motion.

<text>Usuba bōchō (薄刃包丁 — lit. &quot;thin blade kitchen knife&quot;) is the traditional vegetable knife for the professional Japanese chef. Like other Japanese professional knives, &quot;usuba&quot; are chisel ground, and have a single bevel on the front side, and have a hollow ground &quot;urasuki&quot; on the back side. &quot;Usuba&quot; characteristically have a straight edge, with little or no curve, and are wide or tall blade in height, to allow knuckle clearance when chopping on a cutting board. A &quot;usubas&quot; is relatively thin compared to other knives, required for cutting through firm vegetables without cracking them. Due to its height and straight edge, they are also used for specialized cuts such as &quot;katsuramuki&quot;, shaving a vegetable cylinder into a thin sheet.

The &quot;usuba&quot; blade is generally between long.

The &quot;usuba bōchō&quot; is used by professionals and differs from the related nakiri bōchō, which is preferred for home use. While the blade of a &quot;nakiri&quot; has a double bevel, the &quot;usuba&quot; is sharpened only from one side, a style known as &quot;kataba&quot; in Japanese. This &quot;kataba&quot; style edge gives better cuts and allows for the cutting of thinner slices than the &quot;ryōba&quot; used for &quot;nakiri&quot;, but requires more skill to use. The highest quality &quot;kataba&quot; blades have a slight depression (&quot;urasuki&quot;) on the flat side. The sharpened side is usually the right side for a right-handed use of the knife, but knives are available sharpened for left-handed use. The &quot;usuba&quot; is heavier than a &quot;nakiri&quot;, although still much lighter than a &quot;deba bōchō&quot;.

There are several variations of the &quot;usuba bōchō&quot; based on regional styles. The Kantō variation has a square blunt tip, making it appear like a small meat cleaver. The &quot;kamagata&quot;-style variation, from Kansai, has a spine that drops down to the edge at the tip — a sheep&#x27;s foot tip — allowing the &quot;usuba&quot; to do fine delicate work. However, this tip is also delicate and can be broken easily. These are particularly popular with Kyoto chefs, who use the &quot;kamagata usuba&quot; for most of their work. Since Kyoto is landlocked, they rely more heavily on vegetables than Tokyo, making the &quot;usuba&quot; the quintessential knife of professional chefs there. In Kyoto cuisine, the versatile tip allows for intricate cuts and preparations.

<doc id="519679" wikidata="Q421916" url="?curid=519679" title="Diol">
<text>A diol is a chemical compound containing two hydroxyl groups ( groups). An aliphatic diol may also be called a glycol. This pairing of functional groups is pervasive, and many subcategories have been identified. They are used as protecting groups of carbonyl groups, making them essential in synthesis of organic chemistry.

The most common industrial diol is ethylene glycol. Examples of diols in which the hydroxyl functional groups are more widely separated include 1,4-butanediol and propylene-1,3-diol, or beta propylene glycol, .

== Synthesis of classes of diols ==
=== Geminal diols ===

A geminal diol has two hydroxyl groups bonded to the same atom. These species arise by hydration of the carbonyl compounds. The hydration is usually unfavorable, but a notable exception is formaldehyde which, in water, exists in equilibrium with methanediol H2C(OH)2. Another example is (F3C)2C(OH)2, the hydrated form of hexafluoroacetone. Many gem-diols undergo further condensation to give dimeric and oligomeric derivatives. This reaction applies to glyoxal and related aldehydes.

=== Vicinal diols ===

In a vicinal diol, the two hydroxyl groups occupy vicinal positions, that is, they are attached to adjacent atoms. These compounds are called glycols (though the term can be used more widely). Examples include ethane-1,2-diol or ethylene glycol HO−(CH2)2−OH, a common ingredient of antifreeze products. Another example is propane-1,2-diol, or alpha propylene glycol, HO−CH2−CH(OH)−CH3, used in the food and medicine industry, as well as a relatively non-poisonous antifreeze product.

On commercial scales, the main route to vicinal diols is the hydrolysis of epoxides. The epoxides are prepared by epoxidation of the alkene. An example in the synthesis of trans-cyclohexanediol or by microreactor:

For academic research and pharmaceutical areas, vicinal diols are often produced from the oxidation of alkenes, usually with dilute acidic potassium permanganate or Osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide can similarly be used to oxidize alkenes to vicinal diols. The chemical reaction called Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation can be used to produce chiral diols from alkenes using an osmate reagent and a chiral catalyst. Another method is the Woodward cis-hydroxylation (cis diol) and the related Prévost reaction (anti diol), which both use iodine and the silver salt of a carboxylic acid.

Other routes to vic-diols are the hydrogenation of acyloins and the pinacol coupling reaction.

=== 1,3-Diols ===
1,3-Diols are often prepared industrially by aldol condensation of ketones with formaldehyde. You can use many different starting materials to produce syn- or anti-1,3-diols. The resulting carbonyl is reduced using the Cannizzaro reaction or by catalytic hydrogenation:
: RC(O)CH3 + CH2O → RC(O)CH2CH2OH
: RC(O)CH2CH2OH + H2 → RCH(OH)CH2CH2OH 
2,2-Disubstituted propane-1,3-diols are prepared in this way. Examples include 2-methyl-2-propyl-1,3-propanediol and neopentyl glycol.

1,3-Diols can be prepared by hydration of α,β-unsaturated ketones and aldehydes. The resulting keto-alcohol is hydrogenated. Another route involves the hydroformylation of epoxides followed by hydrogenation of the aldehyde. This method has been used for 1,3-propanediol from ethylene oxide.

More specialized routes to 1,3-diols involves the reaction between an alkene and formaldehyde, the Prins reaction. 1,3-diols can be produced diastereoselectively from the corresponding β-hydroxy ketones using the Evans–Saksena, Narasaka–Prasad or Evans–Tishchenko reduction protocols.

1,3-Diols are described as &quot;syn&quot; or &quot;anti&quot; depending on the relative stereochemistries of the carbon atoms bearing the hydroxyl functional groups. Zincophorin is a natural product that contains both &quot;syn&quot; and &quot;anti&quot; 1,3-diols.

=== 1,4-, 1,5-, and longer diols ===
Diols where the hydroxyl groups are separated by several carbon centers are generally prepared by hydrogenation of diesters of the corresponding dicarboxylic acids: 
:(CH2)n(CO2R)2 + 4 H2 → (CH2)n(CH2OH)2 + 2 H2O + 2 ROH
1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, and are important precursors to polyurethanes.

== Reactions ==
From the industrial perspective, the dominant reactions of the diols is in the production of polyurethanes and alkyd resins.

=== General diols ===
Diols react as alcohols, by esterification and ether formation. 
Diols such as ethylene glycol are used as co-monomers in polymerization reactions forming polymers including some polyesters and polyurethanes. A different monomer with two identical functional groups, such as a dioyl dichloride or dioic acid is required to continue the process of polymerization through repeated esterification processes.

A diol can be converted to cyclic ether by using an acid catalyst, this is diol cyclization. Firstly, it involves protonation of the hydroxyl group. Then, followed by intramolecular nucleophilic substitution, the second hydroxyl group attacks the electron deficient carbon. Provided that there are enough carbon atoms that the angle strain is not too much, a cyclic ether can be formed.

1,2-diols and 1,3-diols can be protected using a protecting group. Protecting groups are used so that the functional group does not react to future reactions. Benzylidene groups are used to protect 1,3-diols. There are extremely useful in biochemistry as shown below of a carbohydrate derivative being protected.

Diols can also be used to protect carbonyl groups. They are commonly used and are quite efficient at synthesizing cyclic acetals. These protect the carbonyl groups from reacting from any further synthesis until it is necessary to remove them. The reaction below depicts a diol being used to protect a carbonyl using zirconium tetrachloride.

Diols can also be converted to lactones employing the Fétizon oxidation reaction.

=== Vicinal diols ===
In glycol cleavage, the C−C bond in a vicinal diol is cleaved with formation of ketone or aldehyde functional groups. See Diol oxidation.

=== Geminal diols ===
In general, organic geminal diols readily dehydrate to form a carbonyl group.

<text>James Anthony Piersall (November 14, 1929 – June 3, 2017) was an American baseball center fielder who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for five teams, from 1950 through 1967. Piersall was best known for his well-publicized battle with bipolar disorder that became the subject of a book and a film, &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;.

==Early life==
Piersall led the Leavenworth High School (Waterbury, Connecticut) basketball team to the 1947 New England championship, scoring 29 points in the final game.

==Early athletic career==

Piersall became a professional baseball player at age 18, having signed a contract with the Boston Red Sox in 1948. He reached Major League Baseball in 1950, playing in six games as one of its youngest players.

In 1952, he earned a more substantial role with the Red Sox, frequently referring to himself as &quot;the Waterbury Wizard,&quot; a nickname not well received by teammates. On June 10, 1953, he set the Red Sox club record for hits in a nine-inning game, with six. He established himself as one of the game&#x27;s best defensive outfielders, leading AL center fielders in fielding percentage and total zone runs five times each.

==Personal problems==
On May 24, 1952, just before a game against the New York Yankees, Piersall engaged in a fistfight with Yankee infielder Billy Martin. Following the brawl, Piersall briefly scuffled with teammate Mickey McDermott in the Red Sox clubhouse. After several such incidents, including Piersall spanking the four-year-old son of teammate Vern Stephens in the Red Sox clubhouse during a game, he was demoted to the minor league Birmingham Barons on June 28.

In less than three weeks with the Barons, Piersall was ejected on four occasions, the last coming after striking out in the second inning on July 16. Prior to his at-bat, he had acknowledged teammate Milt Bolling&#x27;s home run by spraying home plate with a water pistol.
Receiving a three-day suspension, Piersall entered treatment three days later at the Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts. Diagnosed with &quot;nervous exhaustion&quot;, Piersall underwent electroshock therapy and began taking a new drug called Lithium which leveled out his moods. He spent the next seven weeks in the facility and missed the remainder of the season.

Piersall returned to the Red Sox in the 1953 season, finishing ninth in voting for the MVP Award.

He once stepped up to bat wearing a Beatles wig and playing &quot;air guitar&quot; on his bat, led cheers for himself in the outfield during breaks in play, and &quot;talked&quot; to Babe Ruth behind the center field monuments at Yankee Stadium. In his autobiography, Piersall commented, &quot;Probably the best thing that ever happened to me was going nuts. Who ever heard of Jimmy Piersall until that happened?&quot;

==Later athletic career==
Piersall was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1954 and 1956. By the end of the 1956 season, in which he played all 156 games, he posted a league-leading 40 doubles, scored 91 runs, drove in 87, and had a .293 batting average. The following year, he hit 19 home runs and scored 103 runs. He won a Gold Glove Award in 1958.

On December 2, 1958, Piersall was traded to the Cleveland Indians for first baseman Vic Wertz and outfielder Gary Geiger. Piersall was reunited with his former combatant Billy Martin, who also had been acquired by the team.

In a Memorial Day doubleheader at Chicago in 1960, he was ejected in the first game for heckling umpire Larry Napp, then after catching the final out of the second game, whirled around and threw the ball at the White Sox&#x27; scoreboard. He later wore a little league helmet during an at-bat against the Detroit Tigers, and after a series of incidents against the Yankees, Indians team physician Donald Kelly ordered psychiatric treatment on June 26.

After a brief absence, Piersall returned only to earn his sixth ejection of the season on July 23, when he was banished after running back and forth in the outfield while Ted Williams of the Red Sox was at bat. His subsequent meeting with American League president Joe Cronin and the departure of manager Joe Gordon seemed to settle Piersall down for the remainder of the season.

Piersall came back during the 1961 season, earning a second Gold Glove while also finishing third in the batting race with a .322 average. However, he remained a volatile player, charging the mound after being hit by a Jim Bunning pitch on June 25, then violently hurling his helmet a month later, earning him a $100 fine in each case.

Despite the minor eruptions, Piersall earned a $2,500 bonus for improved behavior, but was dealt to the Washington Senators on October 5. The outfielder was then sent to the New York Mets on May 23, 1963, for cash and a player to be named later.

In a reserve role with the second-year team, Piersall played briefly under manager Casey Stengel. In the fifth inning of the June 23 game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Piersall hit the 100th home run of his career, off Phillies pitcher Dallas Green. He ran around the bases in the correct order but &quot;facing backwards&quot; as he made the circuit.

One month after reaching the milestone, Piersall was released by the Mets, but he found employment with the Los Angeles Angels on July 28. He would finish his playing career with them, playing nearly four more years before moving into a front office position on May 8, 1967. In a 17-season career, Piersall was a .272 hitter with 104 home runs and 591 RBIs in 1,734 games.

==Career after retirement from baseball==
In 1955, his book &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, co-authored by Al Hirshberg, was published. It became the subject of a 1957 movie version, &quot;Fear Strikes Out&quot;, in which Piersall was portrayed by Anthony Perkins and his father by Karl Malden, directed by Robert Mulligan. Piersall eventually disowned the film because of what he saw as its distortion of the facts, including over-blaming his father for his problems. Many years later, Piersall authored &quot;The Truth Hurts,&quot; in which he details his ouster from the Chicago White Sox organization.

Tommy John recalled a conversation with Piersall in 1964 in which Piersall offered an explanation for his antics. &quot;Look at me,&quot; Piersall said. &quot;I&#x27;m way past my prime, but I&#x27;m making forty grand a year. You know why? Because people come out to the ball park and expect to see me go crazy. So every once in a while I&#x27;ll give them a thrill and do something nuts, like sit on the outfield fence or argue with an umpire. Just enough for people to enjoy. It keeps me in the money. Besides, I have nine kids to feed.&quot;

Piersall had broadcasting jobs with the Oakland A&#x27;s in 1972, the Texas Rangers beginning in 1974 (doing color and play-by-play for televised games), and with the Chicago White Sox from 1977 to 1981, when he was teamed with Harry Caray. He ultimately was fired after excessive on-air criticism of team management. 

In February 1986, Chicago Cubs general manager Dallas Green, off whom he had hit the infamous &quot;backward&quot; home run as a pitcher, hired Piersall as a roving minor league outfield coach and he served in that capacity until his departure in 1999.

For 14 years, Piersall also was an on-air baseball analyst and contributor for WSCR radio, Chicago&#x27;s sportstalk radio station, from 1992 until 2006.

Piersall, who wintered in Arizona, was invited to a White House event honoring the 2004 World Series champion Boston Red Sox on March 2, 2005. According to a Red Sox official, the White House prepared a guest list of about 1,000 for the event, scheduled to be staged on the South Lawn. &quot;This is a real thrill for a poor kid from Waterbury, Connecticut,&quot; Piersall said. &quot;I&#x27;m a 75-year-old man. There aren&#x27;t many things left.&quot; He also said he visited the White House once before as guest of U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

On September 17, 2010, Piersall was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame. Piersall was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2001.

==Television==
Piersall appeared as a mystery guest on the television show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; that aired on April 28, 1957. Guest panelist U.S. Senator George Smathers of Florida correctly guessed Piersall&#x27;s identity.

Piersall briefly appeared as himself on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; with Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon. The first episode of the show&#x27;s fourth season titled &quot;Lucy at Marineland&quot;, it originally was broadcast on September 13, 1965. The plot has Lucy, Mr. Mooney and Lucy&#x27;s son, Jerry meeting Jimmy who is making a public appearance at Marineland on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.

==Personal life==
Piersall was married three times. He had nine children with his first wife, Mary. They divorced in 1968. He resided in Wheaton, Illinois until his death, with his third wife Jan, whom he married in 1982. He was a Roman Catholic.

Piersall died in Wheaton, Illinois on June 3, 2017, at the age of 87.

<text>The Message Transfer Part (MTP) is part of the Signaling System 7 (SS7) used for communication in Public Switched Telephone Networks. MTP is responsible for reliable, unduplicated and in-sequence transport of SS7 messages between communication partners.

MTP is formally defined primarily in ITU-T recommendations
Q.701,
Q.702,
Q.703,
Q.704 and
Q.705.
Tests for the MTP are specified in the ITU-T recommendations
Q.781 for MTP2 and in
Q.782 for MTP3. These tests are used to validate the correct implementation of the MTP protocol.

Different countries use different variants of the MTP protocols. In North America, the formal standard followed is ANSI T1.111. In Europe, national MTP protocols are based on ETSI
EN 300-0088-1.

==Functional levels==
The SS7 stack can be separated into four functional levels:
Level 1 through Level 3 comprise the &quot;MTP&quot;, and Level 4 the &quot;MTP user&quot;. &quot;MTP Level 3&quot; is sometimes abbreviated &quot;MTP3&quot;; &quot;MTP Level 2&quot;, &quot;MTP2&quot;. MTP and SCCP are together referred to as the &quot;Network Service Part (NSP)&quot;.

There is no one-to-one mapping of MTP Levels 1 through 3 onto the OSI model. Instead, MTP provides the functionality of layers 1, 2 and part of layer 3 in the OSI model. The part of layer 3 of the OSI model that MTP does not provide, is provided by SCCP or other Level 4 parts (MTP users).

===Signalling Data Link Functional Level===
&quot;MTP Level 1&quot; is described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.702, and provides the &quot;Signalling Data Link&quot; functional level for narrowband signalling links. For broadband signalling links,
ITU-T Recommendation Q.2110 or
Q.2111 describe the signalling data link function.

MTP1 represents the physical layer. That is, the layer that is responsible for the connection of SS7 Signaling Points into the transmission network over which they communicate with each other. Primarily, this involves the conversion of messaging into electrical signal and the maintenance of the physical links through which these pass. In this way, it is analogous to the Layer 1 of ISDN or other, perhaps more familiar, protocols.

MTP1 normally uses a timeslot in an E-carrier or T-carrier. The Physical interfaces defined include E-1 (2048 kbit/s; 32 64 kbit/s channels), DS-1 (1544 kbit/s; 24 64 kbit/s channels), V.35 (64 kbit/s), DS-0 (64 kbit/s), and DS-0A (56 kbit/s).

===Signalling Link Functional Level===
&quot;MTP Level 2&quot; is described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.703, and provides the &quot;Signalling Link&quot; functional level for narrowband signalling links. For broadband signalling links,
ITU-T Recommendation Q.2140 and
Q.2210 describe the signalling link function referred to as &quot;MTP3b&quot;. The signalling link functional level may also be provided using the SIGTRAN protocol M2PA described in RFC 4165.

&quot;MTP Level 2&quot; ensures accurate end-to-end transmission of a message
across a signaling link.

MTP2 provides flow control, error detection and sequence checking, and retransmits unacknowledged messages. MTP2 uses packets called &quot;signal units&quot; to transmit SS7 messages. There are three types of signal units: Fill-in Signal Unit (FISU), Link Status Signal Unit (LSSU), Message Signal Unit (MSU).

Access to the signalling link functional level&#x27;s service interface can be provided over SCTP by the SIGTRAN protocol M2UA, described in RFC 3331.

MTP Level 2 is tested using the protocol tester and test specifications described in
Q.755,
Q.755.1,
Q.780 and
Q.781.

===Signalling Network Functional Level===
&quot;MTP Level 3&quot; is described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.704, and provides the &quot;Signalling Network&quot; functional level for narrowband signalling links and, with only minor modifications described in
ITU-T Recommendation Q.2210, for broadband signalling links. The functions of &quot;MTP Level 3&quot; may also be replaced with the &quot;Generic Signalling Transport Service&quot; described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.2150.0 as provided by &quot;MTP3b&quot; (Q.2150.1), &quot;SSCOP or SSCOPMCE&quot; (Q.2150.2) or SCTP (Q.2150.3). &quot;MTP Level 3&quot; functions can also be provided by using the IETF SIGTRAN M3UA protocol, described in RFC 4666, in IPSP mode.

MTP3 provides routing functionality to transport signaling messages through the SS7 network to the requested endpoint. Each network element in the SS7 network has a unique address, the Point Code (PC). Message routing is performed according to this address. A distinction is made between a Signaling Transfer Point (STP) which only performs MTP message routing functionalities and a Signaling End Point (SEP) which uses MTP to communicate with other SEPs (that is, telecom switches). MTP3 is also responsible for network management; when the availability of MTP2 data links changes. MTP3 establishes alternative links and re-routes traffic away from failed links and signaling points and propagates information about route availability through the network. Also controls traffic when congestion occurs.

Access to the signalling network functional level&#x27;s service interface (as described in Q.701) can be provided over SCTP by the SIGTRAN protocol M3UA, described in RFC 4666.

MTP Level 3 is tested using the protocol tester and test specifications described in
Q.755,
Q.755.1,
Q.780 and
Q.782.

===MTP Users===
&quot;Level 4&quot; consists of &quot;MTP Users&quot;.
The remaining components of the SS7 stack are all directly, or indirectly, &quot;MTP Users&quot;. Some examples of parts at &quot;Level 4&quot; are SCCP, ISUP, TUP, and, in the UK, IUP. The services provided to &quot;MTP Level 4&quot; by the &quot;MTP&quot; (that is, MTP to MTP Users) is described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.701.775148760

<text>European route E 67 is an E-road running from Prague in the Czech Republic to Estonia and by ferry to Finland. It goes via Prague, Wrocław, Warsaw, Kaunas, Panevėžys, Riga, Tallinn, Helsinki.

The route is known as the Via Baltica between Warsaw and Tallinn, with a distance of . It is a significant road connection between the Baltic states and Poland. 

The route is mostly an ordinary road, but there are plans to convert it into a motorway or expressway, in Poland called S8 (326 of 379 km completed ) and S61 (178,6 of 235 km completed ). 
Along the Via Baltica highway, the stretch of European route E67 between Warsaw and Tallinn, a 5G mobile network will be built in order to facilitate self-driving vehicles and expand opportunities for freight carriers.

== Environmental concerns ==
The Via Baltica attracted great controversy in 2007, as its planned new express road was to take it through several areas in Poland of great natural value. Most controversial was the Augustów bypass, which would take the route through the wetlands of the Rospuda Valley, the last area of its kind remaining in Europe, and an area protected by EU law as part of the European Natura 2000 Network. In July 2007 Polish Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński halted work on the bypass after the European Commission applied for an immediate injunction. After an intense campaign of protests in Poland and abroad and also counter-protests of the local community, the plans have been changed, and now the highway has been rerouted to completely avoid the wilderness area.

<text>ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe). It is influenced by HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk. ActionScript code is usually converted to bytecode format by a compiler.

ActionScript is used primarily for the development of websites and software targeting the Adobe Flash platform, originally finding use on web pages in the form of embedded SWF files.

ActionScript 3 is also used with the Adobe AIR system for the development of desktop and mobile applications. The language itself is open-source in that its specification is offered free of charge and both an open-source compiler (as part of Apache Flex) and open-source virtual machine (Tamarin) are available.

ActionScript was also used with Scaleform GFx for the development of three-dimensional video-game user interfaces and heads up displays.

==Overview==
ActionScript was initially designed for controlling simple two-dimensional vector animations made in Adobe Flash (formerly Macromedia Flash). Initially focused on animation, early versions of Flash content offered few interactivity features, thus had very limited scripting ability. Later versions added functionality allowing for the creation of web-based games and rich web applications with streaming media (such as video and audio). Today, ActionScript is suitable for desktop and mobile development through Adobe AIR; it is used in some database applications and in basic robotics as in Make Controller Kit.

Flash MX 2004 introduced ActionScript 2.0, a scripting language more suited to the development of Flash applications. Saving time is often possible by scripting something rather than animating it, which usually also enables a higher level of flexibility when editing.

Since the arrival of the Flash Player 9 alpha (in 2006), a newer version of ActionScript has been released, ActionScript 3.0. This version of the language is intended to be compiled and run on a version of the Tamarin virtual machine, formerly ActionScript Virtual Machine 2, that was also fully rewritten (dubbed AVM2). Because of this, code written in ActionScript 3.0 is generally targeted for Flash Player 9 and higher, and will not work in prior versions. At the same time, ActionScript 3.0 executes up to 10 times faster than legacy ActionScript code due to the just-in-time compiler enhancements.

Flash libraries can be used with the XML abilities of the browser to render rich content in the browser. This technology is known as Asynchronous Flash and XML, much like AJAX. Adobe offers its Flex product line to meet the demand for rich web applications built on the Flash runtime, with behaviors and programming done in ActionScript. ActionScript 3.0 forms the foundation of the Flex 2 application programming interface (API).

==History==
ActionScript started as an object-oriented programming language for Macromedia&#x27;s Flash authoring tool, later developed by Adobe Systems as Adobe Flash. The first three versions of the Flash authoring tool provided limited interactivity features. Early Flash developers could attach a simple command, called an &quot;action&quot;, to a button or a frame. The set of actions was basic navigation controls, with commands such as &quot;play&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;getURL&quot;, and &quot;gotoAndPlay&quot;.

With the release of Flash 4 in 1999, this simple set of actions became a small scripting language. New capabilities introduced for Flash 4 included variables, expressions, operators, if statements, and loops. Although referred to internally as &quot;ActionScript&quot;, the Flash 4 user manual and marketing documents continued to use the term &quot;actions&quot; to describe this set of commands.

===Timeline by player version===
* Flash Player 2: The first version with scripting support, its actions included gotoAndPlay, gotoAndStop, nextFrame and nextScene for timeline control.
* Flash Player 3: Expanded basic scripting support, it has the ability to load external SWFs (loadMovie).
* Flash Player 4: The first player with a full scripting implementation (called &quot;Actions&quot;), the scripting was a Flash-based syntax and contained support for loops, conditionals, variables, and other basic language constructs.
* Flash Player 5: Included in the first version of ActionScript, it used prototype-based programming based on ECMAScript, and allowed full procedural programming and object-oriented programming. Design based development.
* Flash Player 6 added an event-handling model, accessibility controls, and support for switch. The first version with support for the Action Message Format (AMF) and Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) allowed for on demand audio/video streaming.
* Flash Player 7: Additions to it include Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) styling for text and support for ActionScript 2.0, a programming language based on the ECMAScript 4 Netscape Proposal with class-based inheritance. However, ActionScript 2.0 can cross compile to ActionScript 1.0 bytecode, so that it can run in Flash Player 6.
* Flash Player 8 further extended ActionScript 1/ActionScript 2 by adding new class libraries with APIs for controlling bitmap data at run-time, file uploads, and live filters for blur and drop shadow.
* Flash Player 9 (initially called 8.5) added ActionScript 3.0 with the advent of a new virtual machine, called ActionScript Virtual Machine 2 (AVM2), which coexists with the previous AVM1 needed to support legacy content. Performance increases were a major objective for this release of the player, including a new just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Support for binary sockets, ECMAScript for XML (E4X) XML parsing, full-screen mode, and regular expressions were added. This is the first release of the player to be titled Adobe Flash Player.
* Flash Player 10 (initially called Astro): Added basic 3D manipulation, such as rotating on the X, Y, and Z axis, a 3D drawing API, and texture mapping. Ability to create custom filters using Adobe Pixel Bender. Several visual processing tasks are now offloaded to the GPU which gives a noticeable decrease to rendering time for each frame, resulting in higher frame rates, especially with H.264 video. There is a new sound API which allows for custom creation of audio in flash, something that has never been possible before. Furthermore, Flash Player 10 supports Peer to Peer (P2P) communication with Real Time Media Flow Protocol (RTMFP).
* Flash Player 11: The major addition in this version are the Stage3D-based advanced (graphic card accelerated) 3D capabilities for Windows Desktop, Mac Desktop, iOS, Android, and other major platforms. Significant compatibility improvements have been added for the iOS platform, and other non-desktop platforms. Other features include H.264 encoding for cameras, Native JSON support, Cubic Bézier Curves, a secure random number generator, LZMA compression for SWF files, workers to offload some code execution to other processor threads, graphics card accelerated camera feed rendering, memory intrinsics and performance analysis, and the ActionScript Compiler 2.0, as well as some other minor additions.
* Flash Player 11.2: released in March 2012, focused on adding features that are key for the gaming and video markets. Some of the features in the release include the following: Mouse-lock support. Right and middle mouse-click support. Context menu disabling. Hardware-accelerated graphics/Stage 3D support for Apple iOS and Android via Adobe AIR. Support for more hardware accelerated video cards (from January 2008) in order to expand availability of hardware-accelerated content. New Throttle event API (dispatches event when Flash Player throttles, pauses, or resumes content). Multithreaded video decoding pipeline on PCs, which improves overall performance of video on all desktop platforms. Notification of use of premium features in the debug players; content runs unrestricted in the release players.
* Flash Player 11.3: released in June 2012, focused on enabling features and functionality key for the gaming market, as well as addressing popular feature requests from developers. Some of the features in this release include the following: Keyboard input support in full-screen mode. Improved audio support for working with low-latency audio. Ability to progressively stream textures for Stage 3D content. Protected mode for Flash Player in Firefox. Frame label events. Support for compressing BitmapData to JPEG and PNG formats. Support for Mac OS X App Store application sandboxing requirements. Text streaming support for Stage 3D. Expanded information about GPU driver details. Bitmap draw with quality API (new). Release outside mouse event API. Flash Player silent update support for Mac OS. Stylus support for Android 4.0 devices (Adobe AIR). USB debugging for iOS (Adobe AIR). iOS simulator support (Adobe AIR).
* Flash Player 11.4: Released in August 2012, it focused on enabling features and functionality that are key for the gaming market, as well as addressing popular feature requests from developers. Some of the features in this release include ActionScript workers (enables concurrent ActionScript execution on separate threads), support for advanced profiling, LZMA compression support for ByteArray, support for hardware-accelerated video cards for Stage 3D expanded to 2006, improved ActionScript performance when targeting Apple iOS, performance index API to inform about performance capabilities of current environment, support for compressed textures with alpha support, support for StageVideo.attachCamera API, and support for push notifications for iOS (Adobe AIR).
* Flash Player 11.5: Released in November 2012, it focused on performance improvement and stability. Some of the features in this release include shared ByteArray support for ActionScript workers, debug stack trace in release builds of Flash Player, and various bug fixes.
* Flash Player 11.6: Released in March 2013, it focuses on performance improvements, security enhancements, and stability. Some of the features in this release include ability to query graphics vector data at runtime, full-screen permission dialog user interface improvements, ability to load SWFs at runtime when deploying as an AIR application in AOT mode on iOS, finer-grained control over supported display resolution on iOS devices when deploying as an AIR application, HiDPI support for Flash Professional, and ActionScript 3 access to fast memory operations/intrinsics.
* Flash Player 11.7: Released in June 2013, code-named &quot;Geary&quot;, this release focuses on premium video, gaming, security, and stability. Some of the features planned for this release include Android captive runtime debugging, support for the OUYA controller, remote hosting of SWF files on iOS, and preventing backup of shared objects on iOS for better iCloud support.
* Flash Player 11.8: Adobe was planning to release this version in the early part of the second half of 2013, code-named &quot;Harrison&quot;. This release focused on premium video, gaming, security, and stability. Some of the features in this release would have included recursive stop API on MovieClips and GamePad support on desktop browsers and Android.

===Timeline by ActionScript version===
====2000–2004: ActionScript &quot;1.0&quot; ====
With the release of Flash 5 in September 2000, the &quot;actions&quot; from Flash 4 were enhanced once more and named &quot;ActionScript&quot; for the first time. This was the first version of ActionScript with influences from JavaScript and the ECMA-262 (Third Edition) standard, supporting the said standard&#x27;s object model and many of its core data types. Local variables may be declared with the statement, and user-defined functions with parameter passing and return values can also be created. Notably, ActionScript could now also be typed with a text editor rather than being assembled by choosing actions from drop-down lists and dialog box controls. With the next release of its authoring tool, Flash MX, and its corresponding player, Flash Player 6, the language remained essentially unchanged; there were only minor changes, such as the addition of the statement and the &quot;strict equality&quot; () operator, which brought it closer to being ECMA-262-compliant. Two important features of ActionScript that distinguish it from later versions are its loose type system and its reliance on prototype-based inheritance. Loose typing refers to the ability of a variable to hold any type of data. This allows for rapid script development and is particularly well-suited for small-scale scripting projects. Prototype-based inheritance is the ActionScript 1.0 mechanism for code reuse and object-oriented programming. Instead of a keyword that defines common characteristics of a class, ActionScript 1.0 uses a special object that serves as a &quot;prototype&quot; for a class of objects. All common characteristics of a class are defined in the class&#x27;s prototype object and every instance of that class contains a link to that prototype object.

====2003–2006: ActionScript 2.0 ====
The next major revision of the language, ActionScript 2.0, was introduced in September 2003 with the release of Flash MX 2004 and its corresponding player, Flash Player 7. In response to user demand for a language better equipped for larger and more complex applications, ActionScript 2.0 featured compile-time type checking and class-based syntax, such as the keywords and . While this allowed for a more structured object-oriented programming approach, the code would still be compiled to ActionScript 1.0 bytecode, allowing it to be used on the preceding Flash Player 6 as well. In other words, the class-based inheritance syntax was a layer on top of the existing prototype-based system. With ActionScript 2.0, developers could constrain variables to a specific type by adding a type annotation so that type mismatch errors could be found at compile-time. ActionScript 2.0 also introduced class-based inheritance syntax so that developers could create classes and interfaces, much as they would in class-based languages such as Java and C++. This version conformed partially to the ECMAScript Fourth Edition draft specification.

====2006–2020: ActionScript 3.0====
In June 2006, ActionScript 3.0 debuted with Adobe Flex 2.0 and its corresponding player, Flash Player 9. ActionScript 3.0 was a fundamental restructuring of the language, so much so that it uses an entirely different virtual machine. Flash Player 9 contains two virtual machines, AVM1 for code written in ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0, and AVM2 for content written in ActionScript 3.0. ActionScript 3.0 added limited support for hardware acceleration (DirectX, OpenGL).

The update to the language introduced several new features:
* Compile-time and run-time type checking—type information exists at both compile-time and runtime.
* Improved performance from a class-based inheritance system separate from the prototype-based inheritance system.
* Support for packages, namespaces, and regular expressions.
* Compiles to an entirely new type of bytecode, incompatible with ActionScript 1.0 and 2.0 bytecode.
* Revised Flash Player API, organized into packages.
* Unified event handling system based on the DOM event handling standard.
* Integration of ECMAScript for XML (E4X) for purposes of XML processing.
* Direct access to the Flash runtime display list for complete control of what gets displayed at runtime.
* Completely conforming implementation of the ECMAScript fourth edition draft specification.
* Limited support for dynamic 3D objects. (X, Y, Z rotation, and texture mapping)

===Flash Lite===
* Flash Lite 1.0: Flash Lite is the Flash technology specifically developed for mobile phones and consumer electronics devices. Supports Flash 4 ActionScript.
* Flash Lite 1.1: Flash 4 ActionScript support and additional device APIs added.
* Flash Lite 2.0 and 2.1: Added support for Flash 7 ActionScript 2.0 and some additional fscommand2 API.
* Flash Lite 3: Added support for Flash 8 ActionScript 2.0 and also FLV video playback.
* Flash Lite 4: Added support for Flash 10 ActionScript 3.0 as a browser plugin and also hardware graphics acceleration.

===AIR===
Adobe AIR supports ActionScript, in addition to some extended contents, such as the Stage3D engine Adobe has developed. The number of APIs (Application programming interfaces) available to ActionScript 3.0 has also risen dramatically.

==Syntax==
ActionScript code is free form and thus may be created with whichever amount or style of whitespace that the author desires. The basic syntax is derived from ECMAScript.

===ActionScript 2.0===
The following code, which works in any compliant player, creates a text field at depth 0, at position (0, 0) on the screen (measured in pixels), that is 100 pixels wide and high. Then the codice_1 parameter is set to the &quot;&quot; string, and it is automatically displayed in the player:

createTextField(&quot;greet&quot;, 0, 0, 0, 100, 100);
greet.text = &quot;Hello, world&quot;;

When writing external ActionScript 2.0 class files the above example could be written in a file named as following.

class com.example.Greeter extends MovieClip
 public function Greeter()
 var txtHello: TextField = this.createTextField(&quot;txtHello&quot;, 0, 0, 0, 100, 100);
 txtHello.text = &quot;Hello, world&quot;;
}
===ActionScript 3.0===
ActionScript 3.0 has a similar syntax to ActionScript 2.0, but a different set of APIs for creating objects. Compare the script below to the previous ActionScript 2.0 version:

var txtHello: TextField = new TextField();
txtHello.text = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
this.addChild(txtHello);
Minimal ActionScript 3.0 programs may be somewhat larger and more complicated due to the increased separation of the programming language and the Flash integrated development environment (IDE).

Presume the following file to be :

package com.example
 import flash.text.TextField;
 import flash.display.Sprite;

 public class Greeter extends Sprite
 public function Greeter()
 var txtHello: TextField = new TextField();
 txtHello.text = &quot;Hello World&quot;;
 addParent(txtHello);
 }

ActionScript 3 can also be used in MXML files when using Apache&#x27;s Flex framework:

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;s:Application
 xmlns:fx=&quot;http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009&quot;
 xmlns:s=&quot;library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx/polysylabi&quot;
 xmlns:mx=&quot;library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx&quot;
 layout=&quot;vertical&quot;
 creationComplete=&quot;initApp()&quot;&gt;

 &lt;fx:Script&gt;
 &lt;![CDATA[
 public function initApp(): void {
 // Prints our &quot;Hello, world!&quot; message into title
 title.text = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
 ]]&gt;
 &lt;/fx:Script&gt;

 &lt;s:Label id=&quot;title&quot; fontSize=&quot;54&quot; fontStyle=&quot;bold&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/s:Application&gt;
==Data structures==

===Data types===
ActionScript primarily consists of &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;simple&quot; data types that are used to create other data types. These data types are very similar to Java data types. Since ActionScript 3 was a complete rewrite of ActionScript 2, the data types and their inheritances have changed.

ActionScript 2 top level data types

* String: A list of characters such as &quot;Hello World&quot;
* Number: Any Numeric value
* Boolean: A simple binary storage that can only be &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.
* Object: Object is the data type all complex data types inherit from. It allows for the grouping of methods, functions, parameters, and other objects.

ActionScript 2 complex data types

There are additional &quot;complex&quot; data types. These are more processor and memory intensive and consist of many &quot;simple&quot; data types. For AS2, some of these data types are:

* MovieClip: An ActionScript creation that allows easy usage of visible objects.
* TextField: A simple dynamic or input text field. Inherits the MovieClip type.
* Button: A simple button with 4 frames (states): Up, Over, Down and Hit. Inherits the MovieClip type.
* Date: Allows access to information about a specific point in time.
* Array: Allows linear storage of data.
* XML: An XML object
* XMLNode: An XML node
* LoadVars: A Load Variables object allows for the storing and send of HTTP POST and HTTP GET variables
* Sound
* NetStream
* NetConnection
* MovieClipLoader
* EventListener

ActionScript 3 primitive (prime) data types

* Boolean: The Boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false or 1 and 0. No other values are valid.
* int: The int data type is a 32-bit integer between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.
* Null: The Null data type contains only one value, null. This is the default value for the String data type and all classes that define complex data types, including the Object class.
* Number: The Number data type can represent integers, unsigned integers, and floating-point numbers. The Number data type uses the 64-bit double-precision format as specified by the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE-754). The Number type can store integers between -9,007,199,254,740,992 (-253) to 9,007,199,254,740,992 (253), and floating-point values between Number.MAX_VALUE (1.79769313486231e+308) and Number.MIN_VALUE (4.940656458412467e-324).
* String: The String data type represents a sequence of 16-bit characters. Strings are stored internally as Unicode characters, using the UTF-16 format. Previous versions of Flash used the UTF-8 format.
* uint: The uint (unsigned integer) data type is a 32-bit unsigned integer between 0 and 4,294,967,295.
* void: The void data type contains only one value, undefined. In previous versions of ActionScript, undefined was the default value for instances of the Object class. In ActionScript 3.0, the default value for Object instances is null.

ActionScript 3 some complex data types

* Array: Contains a list of data. Though ActionScript 3 is a strongly typed language, the contents of an Array may be of any type and values must be cast back to their original type after retrieval (support for typed Arrays has recently been added with the Vector class).
* Date: A date object containing the date/time digital representation.
* Error: A generic error object that allows runtime error reporting when thrown as an exception.
* flash.display:Bitmap: A non-animated bitmap display object.
* flash.display:MovieClip: Animated movie clip display object; Flash timeline is, by default, a MovieClip.
* flash.display:Shape: A non-animated vector shape object.
* flash.display:SimpleButton: A simple interactive button type supporting &quot;up&quot;, &quot;over&quot;, and &quot;down&quot; states with an arbitrary hit area.
* flash.display:Sprite: A display object container without a timeline.
* flash.media:Video: A video playback object supporting direct (progressive download) or streaming (RTMP) transports. As of Flash Player version 9.0.115.0, the H.264/MP4 high-definition video format is also supported alongside standard Flash video (FLV) content.
* flash.text:TextField: A dynamic, optionally interactive text field object.
* flash.utils:ByteArray: Contains an array of binary byte data.
* flash.utils:Dictionary: Dictionaries are a variant of Object that may contain keys of any data type (whereas Object always uses strings for its keys).
* Function: The core class for all Flash method definitions.
* Object: The Object data type is defined by the Object class. The Object class serves as the base class for all class definitions in ActionScript. Objects in their basic form can be used as associative arrays that contain key-value pairs, where keys are Strings and values may be any type.
* RegExp: A regular expression object for strings.
* Vector: A variant of array supported when publishing for Flash Player 10 or above. Vectors are typed, dense Arrays (values must be defined or null) which may be fixed-length, and are bounds-checked during retrieval. Vectors are not just more typesafe than Arrays but also perform faster.
* XML: A revised XML object based on the E4X (Standard ECMA-357); nodes and attributes are accessed differently from ActionScript 2.0 object (a legacy class named XMLDocument is provided for backwards compatibility).
* XMLList: An array-based object for various content lookups in the XML class.

===Using data types===
The basic syntax is:

var variableName: VariableType = new VariableType(param1, param2, ..., paramN);

So in order to make an empty Object:

var myObject: Object = new Object();

Or, in an informal way:

var myObject = {};

Some types are automatically put in place:

var myString: String = &quot;Hello Wikipedia!&quot;; // This would automatically set the variable as a string.
var myNumber: Number = 5; // This would do the same for a number.
var myObject: Object = { param1: &quot;Hi!&quot;, param2: 76 }; // This creates an object with two variables.
// param1 is a string with the data of &quot;Hi!&quot;,
// and param2 is a number with the data of 76.

// This is the syntax for automatically creating an Array.
var myArray: Array = [5, &quot;Hello!&quot;, { a: 5, b: 7 }];
// It creates an Array with 3 variables.
// The first (0) is a number with the value of 5,
// the second (1) is a string with the value of &quot;Hello!&quot;,
// and the third (2) is an object with { a: 5, b: 7 }.

Unlike some object-oriented languages, ActionScript makes no distinction between primitive types and reference types. In ActionScript, all variables are reference types. However, objects that belong to the primitive data types, which includes Boolean, Number, int, uint, and String, are immutable.

So if a variable of a supposedly primitive type, e.g. an integer is passed to a function, altering that variable inside the function will not alter the original variable, as a new int Object is created when inside the function. If a variable of another (not primitive) datatype, e.g. XML is passed to a function, altering that variable inside the function will alter the original variable as well, as no new XML Object is created.

Some data types can be assigned values with literals:

var item1: String = &quot;ABC&quot;;
var item2: Boolean = true;
var item3: Number = 12;
var item4: Array = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;];
var item5: Object = { name: &quot;Actionscript&quot;, version: &quot;3.0&quot; };
var item6: XML = &lt;node&gt;&lt;child /&gt;&lt;/node&gt;; // Note that the primitive XML is not quoted

A reference in ActionScript is a pointer to an instance of a class. A reference stores the memory address of an object – operations against references will follow the value of the reference to the memory address of the object and carry out the operation on that object. All objects in ActionScript are accessed through references instead of being accessed directly.

var item1: XML = new XML(&quot;&lt;node&gt;&lt;child /&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&quot;);
var item2: XML = item1;
item2.firstChild.attributes.value = 13;
// item1 now equals item2 since item2 simply points to what item1 points to.
// Both are now:
// &lt;node&gt;&lt;child value=&quot;13&quot; /&gt;&lt;/node&gt;

Only references to an object may be removed by using the &quot;delete&quot; keyword. Removal of actual objects and data is done by the Flash Player garbage collector which checks for any existing references in the Flash memory space. If none are found (no other reference is made to the orphaned object), it is removed from memory. For this reason, memory management in ActionScript requires careful application development planning.

var item1: XML = new XML(&quot;&lt;node&gt;&lt;child /&gt;&lt;/node&gt;&quot;);
delete item1;
// If no other reference to item1 is present anywhere else in the application,
// it will be removed on the garbage collector&#x27;s next pass
==Code protection==
Like most bytecode file formats, Flash SWF files can be decompiled into their source code and assets (similarly to how Microsoft .NET files can be decompiled). Some decompilers are capable of nearly full reconstruction of the original source file, down to the actual code that was used during creation (although results vary on a case-by-case basis).

In opposition to the decompilers, ActionScript obfuscators have been introduced, which transform code into a form that breaks decompiler output while preserving the functionality and structure of the program. Higher-quality obfuscators implement lexical transformations such as identifier renaming, control flow transformation, and data abstraction transformation which collectively make it harder for decompilers to generate output likely to be useful to a human. Less robust obfuscators insert traps for decompilers. Such obfuscators either cause the decompiler software to crash unexpectedly or to generate unintelligible source code.

<text>Chongqing University (CQU; ) is a public university in Chongqing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China. The university is part of Project 211, Project 985, and the Double First-Class Construction.

Chongqing University is especially highly recognized in Architecture, Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, and Management Science. According to Academic Ranking of World Universities 2024, CQU is ranked 151-200 in the world. 

==History==

Chongqing University was founded in 1929, when some professors born in Chongqing, working at Chengdu University, decided to found a new University in Chongqing. The university was founded with the help of General Liu Xiang, whose involvement resulted in the founding of the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee. On October 12, the first term of Chongqing University began, and the Chongqing University Preparatory Committee published the &quot;Chongqing University Founding Declaration&quot;, which declared talents and education to be the driving force of the country and the world&#x27;s development.

In 1937, the Capital Nanjing was occupied. The Chinese government ordered that all agencies move to Chongqing and continue resisting Japanese aggression. This order resulted in the relocation of the National Central University to Chongqing, where it was gifted 200mu of land by the Chongqing University, and a cooperative relationship was established between the two universities. Many distinguished professors taught at the two universities during third period, including Li Siguang, Xu Beihong, Wu Guanzhong, Ma Yinchu, He Lu, and Lu Zuofu.

In 1942, Chongqing University became a national comprehensive university consisting of six colleges in liberal arts, science, engineering, law, and medicine.

In 1952, the nationwide restructuring of higher education turned Chongqing University into an engineering-orientated multi-disciplinary university under the State Ministry of Education. In 1960, Chongqing University was designated as one of the first key national universities. Since the implementation of reform and opening-up policy in China, Chongqing University has stressed the development of disciplines like humanities, business management, art, and sports education, and has further sped up the process of developing the university into a comprehensive institution of higher learning.

===Present===

Chongqing University has 28 schools plus the graduate school, the City College of Science and Technology, the College of Continuing Education, and the College of Online Education. The university now has a total enrollment of 50,000 students, of which 20,000 are master&#x27;s and doctoral students, and 30,000 are undergraduate students. The university owns 24 mobile workstations for postdoctoral study, 133 doctoral programs, 256 master programs, 18 professional master&#x27;s degree programs, namely MBA, EMBA, MPA, master of engineering, and 89 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs in 8 academic categories of science, engineering, liberal arts, economics, management, law, agriculture and education.

Currently, the university has a total number of 5,400 faculty and staff members, including 2,700 full-time faculty, 3 members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 12 contracted members from other institutions, 6 members of the Subject Evaluation Team of the Academic Degree Committee under the State Council, 4 chief scientists of National 973 Projects, 4 state-level &quot;young experts with distinguished contribution&quot;, 500 doctorate supervisors, 1,700 full professors and associate professors.

Chongqing University covers a total area of 5,500 mu (about 178 hectares), with 1.60 million square meters of construction space. In 2001, Chongqing University Technology Park came into being, as one of the 22 state-level university technology parks in China.

<text>The  (; ) are the bicameral legislative chambers of Spain, consisting of the Congress of Deputies (the lower house) and the Senate (the upper house).

The Congress of Deputies meets in the Palacio de las Cortes. The Senate meets in the Palacio del Senado. Both are in Madrid. The Cortes are elected through universal, free, equal, direct and secret suffrage, with the exception of some senatorial seats, which are elected indirectly by the legislatures of the autonomous communities. The are composed of 615 members: 350 Deputies and 265 Senators.

The members of the serve four-year terms, and they are representatives of the Spanish people. In both chambers, the seats are divided by constituencies that correspond with the fifty provinces of Spain, plus Ceuta and Melilla. However, each island or group of islands within the Canary and Balearic archipelagos forms a different constituency in the Senate.

As a parliamentary system, the Cortes confirm and dismiss the Prime Minister of Spain and their government; specifically, the candidate for Prime Minister has to be invested by the Congress with a majority of affirmative votes. The Congress can also dismiss the Prime Minister through a vote of no confidence. The Cortes also hold the power to enact a constitutional reform.

The modern were created by the 1978 Constitution of Spain, but the institution has a long history.

==History==

===Visigothic Kingdom===

The tribal councils organized under Germanic law in the Visigothic Kingdom had the power of appointing and confirming kings, as well as passing laws and judgment. The Visigothic Code compiled under kings Chindasuinth and Recceswinth in the mid-7th century placed the kings, Visigoths, and native Spanish under a single law and formed the basis of Spanish law through the medieval period. The Visigothic councils, however, gradually came to be completely dominated by the clergy under the leadership of the archbishop of Toledo; with ecclesiastical prerogatives completely secure, they then tended to allow royal edicts to come into effect without further ratification.

===High Middle Ages (8th–12th centuries)===
The royal councils () of the Iberian peninsula&#x27;s various kingdoms came to be known as (Castilian Spanish) or (Valencian Spanish). They began as advisory councils made up of the most powerful nobles and the feudal lords closest to the king. General councils were convened in 873, 1020, 1050, and 1063. The 1188 Cortes of León convened by Alfonso IX is sometimes taken to mark the beginning of parliamentary bodies in Western Europe because it was the first to provide formal national representation of the free urban citizens alongside the clergy and hereditary nobility. Subsequently, larger and more inclusive Cortes occurred in the Principality of Catalonia in 1192, the Kingdom of Portugal in 1211, the Kingdom of Castile in 1250, the Kingdom of Aragon in 1274, the Kingdom of Valencia in 1283, and Kingdom of Navarre in 1300. The Leonese and Castilian Corteses were merged in 1258, after which it provided representation to Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, Zamora, Segovia, Ávila, Salamanca, Cuenca, Toro, Valladolid, Soria, Madrid, Guadalajara, and (after 1492) Granada.

===Rise of the bourgeoisie (12th–15th centuries)===
During the Reconquista, the growth of trade and an urbanized middle class () expanded their importance at the various corteses. The king retained the ability to call and dismiss the Cortes but tended to exchange , further grants of privileges and autonomy, to the residents of certain cities in exchange for lump sum payments to meet military and other obligations. (Modern Navarre preserves certain rights and privileges in its current statute of autonomy directly derived from these fueros.) In some cases, the Cortes was able to independently select agents to act as permanent advisors to the king between its sessions.

===Habsburg rule (16th–17th centuries)===

Beginning with the Catholic Monarchs Isabella and Ferdinand, monarchs&#x27; control over Spain&#x27;s various kingdoms in personal union allowed them to curtail the power of the grandees and burghers. Queen Isabella initially had difficulty in securing funding for the voyages of Christopher Columbus in the 1490s but her grandson the Habsburg emperor Charles V (Charles I of Spain) was able to easily provide for Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s 1519 expedition and then to pointedly sell away all of Spain&#x27;s rights to the Spice Islands (now Indonesia&#x27;s Malukus) without any consultation with the Toledo Cortes in 1529. The 1520 Revolt of the Comuneros had intended to reverse this trend and provide a stronger role for the Cortes but was crushed by the Constable&#x27;s royalist forces at the 1521 Battle of Villalar and then brutally suppressed. 

Reorganized, the corteses retained some power over the realm&#x27;s financesparticularly in Aragonbut became limited to a consultative entity. By the reign of Philip II, the delegates of the Cortes of Castile were financially dependent on the Crown for their income. The Imperial Cortes and its deputation () primarily concerned themselves with overseeing previous agreements and the collection of taxes in Castile and the larger empire; separate deputations oversaw similar work in Aragon and Navarre. 

The corteses were able to regain some of their previous powers and influence during the 17th century, as repeated sovereign defaults reduced the monarchy to financial dependency and a series of deputies including the Count-Duke of Olivares oversaw most day-to-day government. Under the young and chronically ill CharlesII, the Cortes of Castile was responsible for naming his mother Mariana regent.

===Bourbon rule (18th–19th centuries)===

During the War of the Spanish Succession, the Bourbon king PhilipV suppressed the Cortes of Aragon and Valencia in 1707 and those of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands in 1714. Following the Peace of Utrecht, the 1716 Nueva Planta Decrees fully abolished the autonomy of the Crown of Aragon. Philip also acted to repeal or curtail most of the diverse grants of autonomy and privilege () throughout his kingdom. Navarre was finally merged during the 1833 territorial division of Spain.

===Napoleonic Spain and the Three Liberal Years===
With both the Bourbon monarchs Charles IV and Ferdinand VII having abdicated their throne and Napoleon Bonaparte having appointed his brother Joseph as the new king, a &quot;Cortes of Cádiz&quot; was convened that claimed sovereignty over Spain and operated as a government-in-exile. The Cortes was the first to act as a single representative body for the entire country and empire, although substitutes had to be chosen from among the people of Cádiz for many regions occupied by the French and unable to send their own delegates. Extremely liberal, the Constitution of 1812 enacted by the Cortes was immediately set aside by Ferdinand upon his restoration in 1814. His conservative policies led to a series of military coups that culminated in Col.Rafael del Riego forcing him to accept a more liberal constitution from 18201823, the Trienio Liberal (&quot;Three Liberal Years&quot;). Ferdinand vetoed nearly every law passed during the period and repeatedly asked other nations to invade and restore him to his previous authority. Finally, a French invasion crushed the National Militia and restored absolutist rule in Spain. During the subsequent reaction, many liberals were forced into exile, manyironicallyending up in France, but generally Ferdinand VII was less strident in his policies through the remainder of his reign.

===First Spanish Republic (1873–1874)===

When the monarchy was overthrown in 1873, the king was forced into exile. The Senate was abolished because of its royally appointed nature. A republic was proclaimed and the Congress of Deputies members started writing a Constitution, supposedly that of a federal republic, with the power of Parliament being nearly supreme (see parliamentary supremacy, although Spain did not use the Westminster system). However, due to numerous issues, Spain was not ready to become a republic; after several crises the government collapsed, and the monarchy was restored in 1874.

===Restoration (1874–1930)===
The regime just after the First Republic is called the Bourbon Restoration. It was formally a constitutional monarchy, with the monarch as a rubberstamp to the Cortes&#x27; acts but with some reserve powers, such as appointing and dismissing the Prime Minister and appointing senators for the new Senate, remade as an elected House. In practice there was an artificial two-party system called &quot;El Turno Pacífico&quot; (peaceful rotation) in which elections were informally fixed so the Conservatives and Liberals would have alternating periods as the majority in the Cortes, with other parties restricted to a smaller number of seats.

Soon after the Soviet revolution (1917), the Spanish political parties started polarizing, and the left-wing Communist Party (PCE) and Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) blamed the Government for supposed election fraud in small towns (&quot;caciquismo&quot;), which was incorrectly supposed to have been wiped out in the 1900s by the failed &quot;regenerationist&quot; movement. In the meantime, spiralling violence started with the murders of many leaders by both sides. Deprived of those leaders, the regime entered a general crisis, with extreme police measures which led to a dictatorship (1921–1930) during which the Senate was again abolished.

===Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939)===

The dictatorship, now ruled by Admiral Aznar-Cabañas, called for local elections. The results were overwhelmingly favorable to the monarchist cause nationally, but most provincial capitals and other sizable cities sided heavily with the republicans. This was interpreted as a victory, as the rural results were under the always-present suspicion of &quot;caciquismo&quot; and other irregularities while the urban results were harder to influence. The King left Spain, and a Republic was declared on 14 April 1931.

The Second Spanish Republic was established as a presidential republic, with a unicameral Parliament and a President of the Republic as the Head of State. Among his powers were the appointment and dismissal of the Prime Minister, either on the advice of Parliament or just having consulted it before, and a limited power to dissolve the Parliament and call for new elections.

The first term was the constituent term charged with creating the new Constitution, with the ex-monarchist leader Niceto Alcalá Zamora as President of the Republic and the left-wing leader Manuel Azaña as Prime Minister. The election gave a majority in the Cortes and thus, the Government, to a coalition between Azaña&#x27;s party and the PSOE. A remarkable deed is universal suffrage, allowing women to vote, a provision highly criticized by Socialist leader Indalecio Prieto, who said the Republic had been backstabbed. Also, for the second time in Spanish history, some regions were granted autonomous governments within the unitary state. Many on the extreme right rose up with General José Sanjurjo in 1932 against the Government&#x27;s social policies, but the coup was quickly defeated.

The elections for the second term were held in 1933 and won by the coalition between the Radical Party (center) and the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas (CEDA) (right). Initially, only the Radical Party entered the Government, with the parliamentary support of the CEDA. However, in the middle of the term, several corruption scandals (among them the Straperlo and the Nombela affairs) sank the Radical Party and the CEDA entered the Government in 1934. This led to uprisings by some leftist parties that were quickly suffocated. In one of them, the left wing government of Catalonia, which had been granted home rule, formally rebelled against the central government, denying its power. This provoked the dissolution of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the imprisonment of their leaders. The leftist minority in the Cortes then pressed Alcalá Zamora for a dissolution, arguing that the uprising were the consequence of social rejection of the right-wing government. The President, a former monarchist Minister wary of the authoritarianism of the right, dissolved Parliament.

The next election was held in 1936. It was hotly contested, with all parties converging into three coalitions: the leftist Popular Front, the right-winged and a Centre coalition. In the end, the Popular Front won with a small edge in votes over the runner-up National Front, but achieved a solid majority due to the new electoral system introduced by the CEDA government hoping that &quot;they&quot; would get the edge in votes. The new Parliament then dismissed Alcalá-Zamora and installed Manuel Azaña in his place. During the third term, the extreme polarisation of the Spanish society was more evident than ever in Parliament, with confrontation reaching the level of death threats. The already bad political and social climate created by the long-term left-right confrontation worsened, and many right-wing rebellions were started. Then, in 1936, the Army&#x27;s failed coup degenerated into the Spanish Civil War, putting an end to the Second Republic.

From November 1936 to October 1937, the Cortes were held at Valencia City Hall, which was still being used for its local purposes at the same time. The building was a target for the Italian Air Force in service of the Nationalist faction, resulting in a bombing in May 1937.

===Francoist Spain (1943–1977)===

Francisco Franco did not prioritize the creation of a consultative or legislative type of assembly during his rule. In 1942, following the first symptoms of change in the international panorama in favour of the Allied Powers, a law established the Cortes Españolas (Spanish Cortes), a non-democratic chamber made up of more than 400 &quot;procuradores&quot; (singular &quot;procurador&quot;). Both the Cortes&#x27; founding law and the subsequent regulations were based on the principles of rejection of parliamentarism and political pluralism. Members of the Cortes were not elected and exercised only symbolic power. It had no power over government spending, and the cabinet, appointed and dismissed by Franco alone, retained real legislative authority. In 1967, with the enaction of the Organic Law of the State, the accommodation of &quot;two family representatives per province, elected by those on the electoral roll of family heads and married women&quot; (the so-called &quot;tercio familiar&quot;) ensued, opening a fraction of the Cortes&#x27; composition to some mechanisms of individual participation.

==Under the Constitution of 1978==
The Cortes are a bicameral parliament composed of a lower house (Congreso de los Diputados, &quot;congress of deputies&quot;) and an upper house (Senado, &quot;senate&quot;). Although they share legislative power, the Congress holds the power to ultimately override any decision of the Senate by a sufficient majority (usually an absolute majority or three-fifths majority).

The Congress is composed of 350 deputies (but that figure may change in the future as the constitution establishes a maximum of 400 and a minimum of 300) directly elected by universal suffrage approximately every four years.

The Senate is partly directly elected in that four senators per province are elected as a general rule and partly appointed by the legislative assemblies of the autonomous communities, one for each community and another one for every million inhabitants in their territory. Although the Senate was conceived as a territorial upper house, it has been argued by nationalist parties and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party that it does not accomplish such a task because 208 out of 265 members of the Senate are elected by popular vote in each province, and only 58 are representatives appointed by the regional legislatures of autonomous communities. Proposals to reform the Senate have been discussed for at least ten years as of November 2007. One of the main themes of reform is to move towards a higher level of federalization and make the Senate a thorough representation of autonomous communities instead of the current system, which tries to incorporate the interests of province and autonomous communities at the same time.

<text>Theodor Georg Andreas Molien (; in Riga – 25 December 1941 in Tomsk) was a Russian mathematician of Baltic German origin. He was born in Riga, Latvia, which at that time was a part of Russian Empire. Molien studied associative algebras and polynomial invariants of finite groups.

==Life==

===Youth in Riga===
Theodor Molien&#x27;s father Eduard Molien was a teacher at the Riga Governorate Gymnasium. Theodor entered that gymnasium in 1872 and graduated in 1879.

===Studies and work in Dorpat===
In January 1880 Molien entered the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat (now University of Tartu) as a student of astronomy. To support his studies his family also moved to Dorpat (now Tartu). In October 1883 the council of the university gave him the degree of a candidate of astronomy. His thesis &quot;Bahn des Cometen 1880 III&quot; was published in Astronomische Nachrichten No. 2510. His further work was supervised by the head of the chair of applied mathematics of the University of Dorpat Anders Lindstedt. In a report to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat Lindstedt acknowledges Molien as having unquestionably exceptional scientific talent (&quot;unzweifelhaft ungewöhnliche wissenschaftliche Begabung&quot;).

In the autumn of 1883, as part of his studies Molien was sent to Leipzig for three semesters. There he attended lectures by Felix Klein on different fields of mathematics and worked in his seminar. He also attended lectures of Carl Neumann, Eduard Study, Wilhelm Killing and Georg Scheffers. At that time Klein was dealing with deep problems of algebra and theory of functions of a complex variable. Following his suggestion, Molien started to study linear transformations of elliptic functions. The obtained results he submitted to the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics of the University of Dorpat as a master thesis titled &quot;Ueber die lineare Transformation der elliptischen Functionen&quot;. In spring 1885 Molien passed the master&#x27;s exams and after the defence in the autumn of 1885 he obtained the scientific degree of a Master of Mathematics. In November 1885 he became a docent at the University of Dorpat. This position he held for 15 years.

Summers (that were free from teaching) of 1886, 1888 and 1889 Molien spent in scientific centers of Germany. His interest concentrated on so-called higher complex numbers (nowadays called hypercomplex numbers). His studies resulted in his article &quot;Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen&quot; (&quot;On systems of higher complex numbers&quot;), published in 1891 in Mathematische Annalen.

On 30 September 1892, Molien defended his dissertation, also titled &quot;Über Systeme höherer komplexer Zahlen&quot;. He got the degree of a doctor of pure mathematics. The importance of his work was acknowledged by Georg Frobenius, Sophus Lie and other mathematicians. One of the main results of his dissertation sounds in modern terms as follows: every simple associative algebra over the field of complex numbers is isomorphic to the algebra of square matrices of a suitable order over the same field.

For his scientific achievements, in 1892 Molien was elected a member of Moscow Mathematical Society. In 1894 French mathematicians awarded him a golden medal dedicated to the seventieth birthday of Charles Hermite. During Dorpat years, Molien had mathematical correspondence with Frobenius and Hurwitz.

Since the University of Dorpat had only one professorship in pure mathematics, Molien had to stay for years at docent&#x27;s position. Being a docent in Dorpat, Molien prepared and gave different lecture courses: Theory of analytic and elliptic functions, modern geometry and algebra, theory of algebraic equations, number theory, projective geometry, theory of quaternions, history of mathematics and others. Some of these courses were new for the university.

In 1887 Russian powers decided to change the language of secondary and higher education in Baltic governorates from German to Russian with the deadline 1 January 1895. With the purpose of improving his Russian language, Molien was sent to Moscow for the year 1892.

===Career in Tomsk===
Only in December 1900 Molien was given a professor&#x27;s position, but not in Dorpat, but in the starting Tomsk Technological Institute in Siberia. He became the first professor of mathematics in Siberia. His was given a task of organizing teaching mathematics at the institute. In Tomsk, besides giving courses in mathematical analysis and differential equations, he wrote textbooks and exercise books on these subjects, and also established a mathematical library at the institute.

Known for his oppositional political views, he had to retire in 1913. Since 1914, Molien was a professor at higher Siberian courses for women in Tomsk, and when in 1917 the faculty of physics and mathematics was opened at the Tomsk State University, he got a professorship there, and stayed at that university until his death on 25 December 1941.

In Tomsk Molien spent 41 years of his life. These years were scientifically not as fruitful as earlier years.

He got the title of Honoured Worker of Science.

==Other interests==
Molien was interested in chess. In 1897-1898 he was in correspondence with a leading Russian chess player Mikhail Chigorin. He was one of the strongest chess players in Dorpat and was particularly known for his blindfold play (Ken Whyld, personal communication, 1995). He was president of the Dorpat chess club, and several of his games were published in the chess journal &quot;Baltische Schachblätter&quot; (edited by Friedrich Amelung). In 1898 Molien published four chess studies.

To 1895 dates his manuscript &quot;On theory of assigning prizes in tournaments&quot;.

Molien had also talent for languages. He knew German, Estonian, French, Swedish already before he entered gymnasium where he learned Greek, Hebrew, Latin, English, Italian. Later he learned Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and Norwegian.

<text>Catti-brie (spelled in later publications as &quot;Cattie-brie&quot;) is a fictional character in the Forgotten Realms setting, based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. The creation of American author R.A. Salvatore, she is primarily known as the love interest of the drow ranger Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden and has appeared in multiple media alongside Drizzt.

==Development==
R.A. Salvatore named Catti-brie after his daughter Caitlin Brielle after the editor suggested &quot;The Crystal Shard&quot; would be better with a strong female character. Salvatore ended the 1996 novel &quot;Passage to Dawn&quot; with &quot;Drizzt and Catti-brie riding off into the sunset&quot; as he had envisioned it to be his final book about Drizzt and his companions after falling out with his then-publisher, TSR, Inc. On the decision to kill off Catti-brie as a direct consequence of the Spellplague event in the &quot;Transitions&quot; trilogy, which begins with 2007’s &quot;The Orc King&quot; and concludes in 2009’s &quot;The Ghost King&quot;, Salvatore explained that &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; publisher Wizards of the Coast had issued the mandate to advance the timeline of the Forgotten Realms by 100 years. Salvatore suggested that his &quot;hand was forced” as the time jump conflicts with Catti-brie&#x27;s natural human lifespan; although he had made plans to take the character in an &quot;interesting direction&quot;, Salvatore concluded that being forced into an uncomfortable space had prompted him to become more creative with his writing in response to the revised setting. Salvatore drew from his personal experiences in his approach to portray the ignominious deaths of Catti-brie and her halfling friend Regis.

Salvatore later found a way to bring Catti-brie back into the story canon along with Drizzt&#x27;s other companions. He recalled feeling nervous about potential negative fan reception, but felt that he had a sensible and justifiable reason for his approach, and thought he could &quot;make a point&quot;. Salvatore emphasized that many readers are emotionally attached to Drizzt and his companions after following the stories he wrote about them for several years.

== Fictional biography ==
Catti-brie is a beautiful auburn-haired and blue-eyed woman with a kind, tolerant, and pragmatic personality. Catti-brie is a member of the Companions of the Hall, and often serves as the emotional compass for her adventuring companions, guiding both Drizzt and Wulfgar into wise action with her common sense and clear insight. Catti-brie was the first person from the Icewind Dale that accepted Drizzt, and she was very young when Drizzt got to know her. 

The mother of Catti-brie died in childbirth, and then her father moved with Catti-brie from Mirabar to Termalaine, which is one of the Ten Towns. He was very successful for three years, until a goblin killed him. Termalaine was threatened by a goblin onslaught until the dwarves of clan Battlehammer rushed from their valley to defeat the goblin horde. Bruenor saved the life of the orphaned girl and adopted Catti-brie as his daughter. Catti-brie has no recollection of her life before Bruenor adopted her, but she did have a pleasant childhood living with the dwarves. As a result of her upbringing, Catti-brie has a stubborn and tough dwarven personality like that of her foster-father.

During the five years that Wulfgar spent in the service of Bruenor, Catti-brie helped him overcome his barbarian upbringing to highlight the compassion and intelligence inside of him. Catti-Brie and Wulfgar developed a bond which grew stronger while they adventured with Bruenor, Regis, and Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, and they were ultimately betrothed. A drow seeking to kill Drizzt attacked Mithral Hall, and Wulfgar was captured by Errtu during one of the battles, ending their relationship tragically. She would then have a tentative, on-again-off-again romance with Drizzt through the novels which culminates in &quot;The Two Swords&quot;. 

The assassin Artemis Entreri was chasing Regis, and Artemis held Catti-brie prisoner. After Mithral Hall was found, Catti-Brie discovered the weapon Taulmaril the Heartseeker, Gift of Anariel, Sister of Faerûn, which was lost in the destroyed Hall of Dumathoin. Catti-Brie additionally carried the sentient sword Khazid&#x27;hea for several years, also known as &quot;Cutter&quot;, which she took from Dantrag Baenre, after Drizzt killed him.

Shortly after beginning her training as a Wizard, Catti-brie was struck by a falling strand of the Weave during the Spellplague. Catti-brie&#x27;s body remained on the material plane, though her mind and spirit is pulled into the plane of existence known as Shadowfell. Her patron goddess Mielikki eventually retrieved her spirit but she could not be returned to the world of the living in her state, instead remaining in a pocket dimension created by Mielikki. In the 2013 book &quot;The Companions&quot;, it is revealed that Mielikki offered Catti-brie the choice of being reincarnated as a mortal newborn of the same race and sex as her first mortal form. She reemerges as a Bedine tribeswoman named Ruqiah who is born in 1463 DR, long after the original Catti-brie died in 1385 DR.

===Weapons===
Catti-brie used Taulmaril in combat and had a limitless arrow supply. She would charge into melee combat armed with Khazid&#x27;hea confident that she could dominate the blade. She was wounded by a boulder thrown by a giant while defending Mithril Hall from the orc legions of Obould Many-Arrows, and this lasting injury limited her ability to fight using melee weaponry. She studies magic under the wizard Alustriel Silverhand.

====Taulmaril the Heartseeker====

Taulmaril was a gift to the Mithral Hall dwarves by Lady Anariel, Sister of Faerûn. The bow is made of wood enspelled not to break or scratch, and the quiver held 20 silver arrows (which can magically teleport back to the quiver); when one was used the quiver magically replaced it. The bow was used by Catti-brie. Part of the weapon&#x27;s enchantment (passed to the arrows when they&#x27;re fired by it) is that the arrows are imbued with crackling energy in flight that causes them to deal far more damage than would be typical for a normal arrow. The energy is probably electrical in nature, as it scorches targets, can set flammables alight, but does not seem to have any particularly enhanced effect upon cold-based creatures.

Another property of Taulmaril the Heartseeker is that the arrow, when fired from the bow, travels at super high speeds compared to a normal bow, allowing it to blast through enemies even when they have armor. 

====Khazid&#x27;hea (Cutter)====

Khazid&#x27;hea was the evil sentient blade she wielded during The Legacy period, the blade with a wicked design all of its own and with the ability to communicate with its user and the ability to change the shape of its own hilt; furthermore the super sharp blade could cut through solid stone. Khazid&#x27;hea could easily take over the minds of others in its search to be wielded by the dark elf ranger Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden, by its measure the greatest fighter in the world. Catti-brie, however, was able to overcome the sword and put it to deadly use, though soon after this Khazid&#x27;hea left the hands of Catti-brie and after some time led to the death of Delly Curtie, Wulfgar&#x27;s wife, and after that fell into the hands of another drow elf. Khazid&#x27;hea&#x27;s ego, it seems, could not stand Catti-brie&#x27;s use of Taulmaril.

Later in the Legacy of the Drow series, specifically &quot;Starless Night&quot;, after Drizzt killed Dantrag Baenre his sword, Khazid&#x27;hea, came into Catti-brie&#x27;s hands when Drizzt refused, saying, &quot;I favor the scimitar&quot;, because the sword&#x27;s hilt took the shape of a unicorn&#x27;s head, the symbol of Mielikki.

The sword&#x27;s name, Khazid&#x27;hea, literally means &quot;cutter&quot; in the drow language.

The Blade itself is sentient in nature, wishing for only the best to wield it. Or it will take over the mind of the &quot;owner&quot;, as evidenced by the use of Delly Curtie, Wulfgar&#x27;s wife, and subsequently several Orcs, to get to Drizzt Do&#x27;Urden in the book &quot;The Two Swords&quot;.

==In other media==

* Catti-brie makes a cameo appearance along with the other Companions of the Hall in 2000&#x27;s &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot;. 
* She appears in 2021&#x27;s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&quot; as one of the four playable characters.
*She appears in the 2021 &quot;&quot; expansion set &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms&quot; as a &quot;Legendary Creature&quot; card in the &quot;Aura Of Courage&quot; .

==Reception==
In the &quot;Io9&quot; series revisiting older &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; novels, Rob Bricken commented that &quot;&quot;The Crystal Shard&quot;&#x27;s biggest crime by far is its scarcity of female characters; only &quot;one&quot; has a name and dialogue. That would be Bruenor’s adopted human daughter Cattie-Brie, who, even though Drizzt calls her his soulmate in chapter one, gets only a few dozen lines&quot;, although he noted that &quot;I know for a fact that Salvatore&#x27;s writing—included his female characters; thankfully, Cattie-Brie even eventually joins Bruenor, Drizzt, and Wulfgar on their adventures in later books—improved over time.&quot; In reviewing the sequel, Bricken commented that &quot;this time Cat is a real protagonist and needs a reason to stay part of the story, with as well-rounded a personality and as much development as the other main characters. This is a massive improvement, although her character arc starts out rough. Basically, despite being a very proficient warrior herself, she’s so terrified of the assassin she can&#x27;t do anything, to the point she occasionally doesn&#x27;t even need to be tied up. Finally, she gets ahold of herself and starts doing the &quot;sow seeds of distrust among the captors&quot; shtick. However, when she does escape, she becomes a badass equal to the others (well, not Drizzt, only Artemis is on par with Drizzt). She manages to trap the golem under a rock pile during her flight, catching up with the others right before they enter Mithral Hall for the final act.&quot;

Recalling the divisive reception over the death of Wulfgar in earlier instalments of &quot;The Legend of Drizzt&quot; series, Salvatore noted that the response to the deaths of Catti-brie and Regis from fans was more subdued.

<text>Ælfwine the mariner is a fictional character found in various early versions of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Legendarium. Tolkien envisaged Ælfwine as an Anglo-Saxon who visited and befriended the Elves and acted as the source of later mythology. Thus, in the frame story, Ælfwine is the stated author of the various translations in Old English that appear in the twelve-volume &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot; edited by Christopher Tolkien.

== Frame story: early links with Britain ==

In &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, begun early in Tolkien&#x27;s writing career, the character who becomes Ælfwine was initially named Ottor Wǽfre (called &quot;Eriol&quot; by the Elves). Ottor is a mariner; he calls himself Wǽfre, (&#x27;restless, wandering&#x27;). He settles on Heligoland and marries Cwén; they have sons Hengest and Horsa, the names of the legendary founders of England. When Cwén dies, Ottor sets out again with the &quot;sea-longing&quot; and sails to find Tol Eressëa. Once there, he marries Naimi, niece of Vairë, one of the keepers of the Cottage of Lost Play. They have sons including Heorrenda who found the &quot;Engle&quot; people (&#x27;the English&#x27;).

The tale of Ælfwine serves as a frame story for the tales of the Elves. Ælfwine set out from Heligoland on a voyage with a small crew but was the lone survivor after his ship crashed upon the rocks near an island. The island was inhabited by an old man who gave him directions to Eressëa. After he found the island the Elves hosted him in the Cottage of Lost Play and narrated their tales to him. He afterwards learned from the Elves that the old man he met was actually &quot;Ylmir&quot;. He was taught most of the tales by the old Elf named Rúmil who is the lore master living on Eressëa. Eriol became more and more unhappy as a man and yearned constantly to be an Elf. He eventually finds out that he can become an elf with a drink of &quot;Limpë &quot;which he is denied by the leader of Kortirion on multiple occasions.

In these early versions, Tol Eressea is seen as the island of Britain, near a smaller island of Ivenry (Ireland). He earned the name Ælfwine from the Elves he stayed with; his first wife, Cwén, was the mother of Hengest and Horsa; his second wife, Naimi, bore him a third son, Heorrenda, a great poet of half-Elven descent, who in the fiction would go on to write the Old English epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. This weaves together a mythology for England, connecting England&#x27;s geography, poetry and mythology with the Legendarium as a plausibly reconstructed (though probably untrue) prehistory.

=== A presented collection ===

The first title for &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot; was

The stories were thus, in the fiction, told to and transmitted by Eriol/Ælfwine, via Heorrenda&#x27;s written book.

The Tolkien scholar Gergely Nagy writes that Tolkien &quot;more and more emphatically thought of his works as &quot;texts within the fictional world&quot;&quot; (his emphasis). Tolkien felt that this complex &quot;double textuality&quot; was critically important, giving the effect of being a real mythology, a collection of documents assembled and edited by different hands, whether Ælfwine&#x27;s or Bilbo&#x27;s or those of unnamed Númenóreans who had transmitted ancient Elvish texts, over a long period of time. Nagy notes that Tolkien&#x27;s friend C. S. Lewis, like him a scholar of English literature, jokingly responded to Tolkien&#x27;s 1925 &quot;The Lay of Leithian&quot; by writing a philological commentary on the text complete with invented names of scholars, conjectures as to the original text, and variant readings, as if the text had been discovered in an archive. One likely source for such a treatment, remarked by scholars including Tom Shippey, Flieger, Anne C. Petty, and Jason Fisher, is Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s Finnish epic &quot;Kalevala&quot;, admired by Tolkien, which had been compiled and edited from a genuine tradition. Another such is Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, something that Tolkien studied intensively.

== Time-travelling elf-friend ==

The Old English name Ælfwine means &quot;Elf-friend&quot;, as does the later Quenya name &quot;Elendil&quot;. Ælfwine is a well-attested historical Germanic name, alongside its Old High German and Lombard equivalents, Alwin and Alboin, respectively.

All of these names were to be used in the unfinished novel &quot;The Lost Road&quot;, written around 1936–1937; it was intended as a tale of time travel, where descendants of Ælfwine experience racial memories or visions of their equivalently-named ancestors, connecting the present time (with the protagonist Alboin Errol) with the mythological. The time-series was to run all the way back to the fall of Númenor, envisaged as a lost island civilisation similar to Atlantis. The later unfinished novel &quot;The Notion Club Papers&quot;, written in 1945–1946 and published posthumously in &quot;Sauron Defeated&quot;, picks up the time travel and the &quot;Elf-friend&quot; names. The protagonist is Alwin Lowdham.

The Hobbit Frodo Baggins, a central figure in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, is given the informal title &quot;Elf-friend&quot; by an Elf, Gildor, whom he meets and addresses in Elvish. The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger notes that this associates him with Ælfwine; she comments further that in the discussion between him and Sam Gamgee, Aragorn, and Legolas about the nature of time in the Elvish realm of Lothlórien, it endows him with a special authority as someone &quot;unusually sensitive&quot; to its mood, and in particular its &quot;timeless quality&quot;. This is in the context of her analysis of how time differs between Lothlórien and what Frodo calls the &quot;mortal lands&quot; outside it. She writes that Ælfwine is what the engineer J. W. Dunne in his book &quot;An Experiment with Time&quot; described as a &quot;Field 2 observer&quot;, effectively able to look down on observers in the lower dimension of time, Field 1, from their higher time dimension like someone in an aircraft seeing the situation of people on the ground below; and by association with Ælfwine, perhaps Frodo too is able to see Elvish time from a certain perspective.

== In the later legendarium ==

The Ælfwine frame story is not present in the published version of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, but Tolkien never fully abandoned a framework akin to the Ælfwine-tradition. Even after he had introduced the Red Book of Westmarch, supposedly compiled and translated by the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins as a framing concept, Ælfwine continued to have some role in the transition of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and other writings from Bilbo&#x27;s translations into modern English. For example, the &quot;Narn i Hîn Húrin&quot;, which Christopher Tolkien dates to the period after the publication of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, has this introductory note: &quot;Here begins that tale which Ǽlfwine made from the &quot;Húrinien&quot;.&quot;

Tolkien never fully dropped the idea of multiple &#x27;voices&#x27; (such as of Rumil or Pengolodh in their &quot;Golden Book&quot;) who supposedly collected the stories of both Mannish and Elvish sources over the millennia of the world&#x27;s history. According to Christopher Tolkien, the &quot;Akallabêth&quot;, which was written in the voice of Pengolodh, in a version that his father had entitled &quot;The Downfall of Númenor&quot;, begins &quot;Of Men, Ælfwine, it is said by the Eldar that they came into the world in the time of the Shadow of Morgoth ...&quot; He admits in the &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; series that removing this destroyed the whole story&#x27;s anchorage in the lore of the Eldarin elves, and led him to make changes to the end of the paragraph that would not have met with his father&#x27;s approval. He points out that the last paragraph of &quot;Akallabeth&quot; as published in the Silmarillion, still contains indirect references to Ælfwine and other &#x27;future mariners&#x27;.

This later Ælfwine was from England, and travelled west to reach the Straight Road, where he either visited the Lonely Island (Tol Eressëa) or only saw its &quot;Golden Book&quot; with the stories about the Elder Days, the time before the rule of Man, at a distance, or dreamed about the Outer Lands (Middle-earth). He was born in either the 10th or 11th century, and in some versions was connected to English royalty.

<text>Friedrich Ludwig Balthasar Amelung ( – ) was a Baltic German cultural historian, businessman and chess endgame composer.

Amelung was born at Võisiku () manor in Governorate of Livonia of the Russian Empire (present-day Jõgeva County in Estonia). 1862–1864 he studied philosophy and chemistry at the University of Dorpat. From 1864 to 1879 and from 1885 to 1902 he was the director of the Rõika-Meleski mirror factory, which he inherited from his father. Amelung published writings about the culture and history of Estonian localities such as Viljandi, Tallinn, and Põltsamaa.

Amelung was known as a chess player and a famous chess quiz author. From 1879 to 1885 he lived in Reval (now Tallinn) and studied the chess history of the Baltics. Between 1888 and 1908 he edited the chess magazine &quot;Baltische Schachblätter&quot;. In 1898 he established the Baltic Chess Society. Amelung published about 230 endgame studies, making him the first chess historian in the Baltic States.

He played a few games with Adolf Anderssen, Gustav Neumann, Carl Mayet, Emil Schallopp, Andreas Ascharin, and Emanuel Schiffers.

He died in 1909 in Riga and is buried at the Kolga-Jaani cemetery in Estonia.

<text>Vermont Yankee was an electricity generating nuclear power plant, located in the town of Vernon, Vermont, in the northeastern United States. It generated 620 megawatts (MWe) of electricity at full power. The plant was a boiling water reactor (BWR), designed by General Electric. It operated from 1972 until December 29, 2014, when its owner Entergy shut down the plant. In 2008, the plant provided 71.8% of all electricity generated within Vermont, amounting to 35% of Vermont&#x27;s electricity consumption. The plant is on the Connecticut River, upstream of the Vernon, Vermont Hydroelectric Dam and used the reservoir pool for its cooling water.

In March 2012, the plant&#x27;s initial 40-year operating license was scheduled to expire; in March 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) extended its license for another 20 years. Vermont Yankee&#x27;s continued operations were complicated by the Vermont state legislature&#x27;s enactment of a law providing the state legislature authority to determine the continued operation of the plant, in addition to the federal government. Entergy requested a new state certificate of public good (CPG), but the Vermont legislature voted in February 2010 against renewed permission to operate. In January 2012, Entergy won a court case, invalidating the state&#x27;s veto power on continued operations. In August 2013, Entergy announced that due to economic factors Vermont Yankee would cease operations in the fourth quarter of 2014. The plant was shut down at 12:12 pm EST on December 29, 2014.

Since the 1970s, there have been many anti-nuclear protests about Vermont Yankee, including large protests after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011, and on the date of the original operating license expiry in March 2012. The plant&#x27;s initial operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was the subject of a lawsuit that produced the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1978 decision &quot;Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&quot;, in which the Supreme Court set forth a significant doctrine in American administrative law.

== Design and function ==

Vermont Yankee was a BWR-4 Boiling water reactor that used a Mark I containment structure. It provided 71.8% of all electricity generated in Vermont in 2008
and met 35% of the overall electricity requirements of the state.

It was originally designed and constructed for 500 MW electrical output. In 2006, it was upgraded to 620 MW electrical output. The reactor produces 1912 MW of heat which is converted to electricity at 32% efficiency. In comparison, the average residential power demand for all of Vermont in 2012 was 239 MW. The nearby Northfield Mountain hydroelectricity facility was built to balance the supply from Yankee.

The reactor core held up to 368 fuel assemblies and 89 control rods. The spent fuel pool is licensed to contain up to 3353 spent fuel assemblies.

== Ownership and operational license==
In 1978, the Vermont Yankee reactor was the subject of &quot;Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.&quot;, an important United States Supreme Court administrative law case which ruled that courts cannot impose procedures upon the NRC as this exceeds their power of judicial review.

On July 31, 2002, Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee, LLC (EVY) purchased the plant from Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corporation (VYNPC) for $180 million. Entergy received the reactor complex, nuclear fuel, inventories, and related real estate, as well as the liability to decommission the plant and related decommissioning trust funds of approximately $310 million. The acquisition included a 10-year power purchase agreement (PPA) under which three of the former owners committed to purchase a portion of the electricity produced by the reactor at a cost of approximately 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour.

On May 6, 2006, Vermont Yankee achieved its power of 1,912 MWth (120% of its original licensed thermal power of 1,593 MW-thermal) because of an NRC approved Extended Power Uprate. The power increase was carried out in steps to allow collection of data on the reactor&#x27;s steam dryer at various power levels, in accordance with the NRC imposed power ascension test plan.

As of 2008, Vermont Yankee employed about 600 people including those in the corporate office on Old Ferry Road in Brattleboro, Vermont.

== Cooling water ==
Vermont Yankee used the Connecticut River as its source of cooling water for its two major water systems: the circulating water system and the service water system. The circulating water system removed heat from the power generation process of the plant by cooling the plant&#x27;s main condenser. The service water system cooled both safety and non-safety related auxiliary components in the nuclear facility and the turbine facility of the plant, and absorbed decay heat from the reactor&#x27;s cooling systems in emergencies or in times when the reactor was shut down.

== Electricity production ==
== Closure/extension planning ==
Entergy Vermont Yankee applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license extension of 20 years on January 27, 2006. In early 2010, the Vermont State Senate voted 26–4 to block the Vermont Public Service Board (PSB) from considering continued operation of Vermont Yankee.

On March 10, 2011, the NRC voted to conclude proceedings regarding renewal of the operating license for the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station near Brattleboro, Vermont, for an additional 20 years. On March 21, 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued their renewal of the operating license for the Vermont Yankee plant for an additional 20 years.; the renewed license will expire March 21, 2032.

On April 14, 2011, Entergy, the owner of Vermont Yankee, sued the state of Vermont to stay open despite the Senate&#x27;s blocking vote.

On August 14, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled, upholding a lower court&#x27;s decision that allowed the Vermont Yankee plant to keep running despite a seven-year effort by the Vermont Legislature to close it, finding that states are &quot;pre-empted&quot; from regulating safety by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, which made safety a federal responsibility.

On August 28, 2013, Entergy announced that due to economic factors, notably the lower cost of electricity provided by competing natural gas-fired power plants, it would cease operations and schedule the plant&#x27;s decommissioning in the fourth quarter of 2014. Vermont Yankee was shut down at 12:12 pm EST on December 29, 2014. All fuel in the reactor was transferred to the spent fuel pool by January 12, 2015. By August 2018, all VY&#x27;s remaining spent nuclear fuel was relocated from the spent fuel pool into in dry fuel storage casks.

In December 2014, Entergy submitted the Post Shutdown Decommissioning Report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This report estimated that the total cost for decommissioning the reactor would be $1.24 billion. The same document reported that only $665 million had been collected in the 42 years of operations of this plant for this purpose. Entergy hopes to raise some of the shortfall funds through &quot;external financing&quot;.

On September 28, 2016, Entergy began auctioning off more than 1,000 lots of goods in Brattleboro, Vt.

Two cooling towers were demolished in July 2019.

==Controversy and operations==

===2007===
Cooling for the plant&#x27;s steam condenser was provided by circulating water through it, drawn from the adjacent Connecticut river. This water did not come in contact with the nuclear reactor and was not radioactive. The cooling towers were used to cool water returning from the condenser before it was discharged back into the river at times when it was too warm to comply with the environmental discharge permit. In 2007 the fourth cell of the west cooling tower collapsed, spilling some of the non-radioactive, cooling water. The collapse was an &quot;industrial safety event,&quot; which did not threaten the integrity of the reactor or release any radiation into the environment. The NRC stated that the remaining cooling tower had enough capacity to allow the plant to operate at full output, however, until September 16, 2007, the reactor was kept at 50% power.

The cause of the collapse was found to be corrosion in steel bolts and rotting of lumber. Entergy asserted that future inspections would be much more stringent in order to prevent further problems.

===2008===
The cooling tower collapse caused Vermont&#x27;s then governor, Jim Douglas, to question the reliability of the power station: In March 2008, a State Senate committee recommended that the Legislature appoint a panel to oversee an independent review of the plant&#x27;s reliability. The panel gave Vermont Yankee a generally positive review. &quot;What this report suggests to me is there is not a cause or reason to seek the closure of the plant because of operational or safety concerns,&quot; said Public Service Commissioner, David O&#x27;Brien.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission performed a tri-annual inspection July–August 2008. It found three &quot;minor faults.&quot; An Associated Press report said that it had won &quot;high marks.&quot;

===2009===
In May 2009, the vice-president of operations at Vermont Yankee told the PSB during the reliability review that he did not believe there was any radioactively contaminated underground piping at the plant, but that he would check and respond to the panel.
In October 2009, Arnold Gundersen, a member of a special oversight panel convened by the Vermont General Assembly, confirmed that radioactive contamination had been detected in underground pipes. An Entergy spokesperson told Vermont Public Radio (VPR) that the earlier testimony was a &quot;miscommunication.&quot; On June 4, 2010, VPR reported that, because they had provided misleading information, Entergy Nuclear would be liable for legal expenses incurred by certain parties.

===2010===
In January 2010, the Vermont Department of Health reported that tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, had been discovered in a sample of ground water taken from a monitoring well the previous November. The level of the isotope was initially below the acceptable limit for drinking water set by the Environmental Protection Agency. By mid-January, however, the level had risen to 20,000 picocuries per liter (pCi/L), the federal limit for drinking water. The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Vermont&#x27;s congressional delegation that the agency would devote more resources to addressing concerns about Vermont Yankee, and that he expected the source of the tritium leak would be located within the next several weeks.

On February 4, 2010, Vermont Yankee reported that ground water samples from a newly dug monitoring well at the reactor site were found to contain about 775,000 pCi of tritium per liter (more than 37 times the federal limit). On February 5, 2010, samples from an underground vault were found to contain 2.7 million pCi/L. On February 14, 2010, the source of the leak was found to be a pair of steam pipes inside the Advanced Off-Gas (AOG) pipe tunnel. The pipes were repaired, stopping the leak.

Samples taken from the river and other drinking water sources by the Vermont Department of Health showed no detectable levels of tritium. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services made a similar statement after several tests of the river.

During the search for the source of the tritium leak, other radionuclides were found in the soil at the site. Levels of cesium-137 were found to be three to ten times higher than background levels. Silt in a pipe tunnel contained 2,600 picocuries/kg, but contamination outside the pipe tunnel was limited to a small volume, about of soil. According to the Vermont State Department of Health, there was no health risk from the cesium, as the quantities were small and it had not migrated.

Since cesium-137 is a fission product, it is an indicator of a nuclear fuel leak, but the consensus was that the cesium-137 probably leaked from defective fuel assemblies during or prior to 2001, when the last leak of that type was reported by Vermont Yankee. (Problems with fuel rods were common in the 1970s and 1980s.)

On May 20, 2010, the NRC released a report on Vermont Yankee:

In early November 2010, a water leak caused by a faulty weld caused a &quot;conservative&quot; four-day shutdown while the pipe involved was repaired. A company spokesman said that &quot;if plant managers had known on Sunday night what they knew on Monday, they might have tried to fix the leak while the plant kept running.&quot;

In 2010, Vermont Electric Power Company constructed a new substation, designated as the Vernon Substation, on the Vermont Yankee site to serve as the site&#x27;s new main transmission facility and to connect a new 345 kV transmission line to Central Vermont as part of its Southern Loop project. The aging Entergy-owned Vermont Yankee substation could not handle the additional line or any additional transformers and VELCO desired to have a utility owned and controlled substation for what is probably the state&#x27;s most important interconnection point. Additionally, the local 115 kV system was relying exclusively on Entergy&#x27;s single 345 kV to 115 kV transformer. The construction of the Vernon substation included a second 345 kV to 115 kV transformer to supplement the existing Entergy owned transformer. The additional transformer also provided redundancy for Vermont Yankee&#x27;s source of offsite power. The four transmission lines that formerly connected directly to the Vermont Yankee substation now connect to the Vernon substation, and three tie-lines, one at 115 kV and two at 345 kV, connect the Vermont Yankee substation to the Vernon substation. Each 345 kV tie line is capable of carrying the full power output of the plant.

===2011===
During the week of January 17, 2011, tritium was detected at a level of 9,200 picocuries per liter (below the federally required reporting level) in an area 150–200 feet north of the location where it was detected a year earlier. According to the State&#x27;s radiological health chief at the Vermont Health Department, Bill Irwin, and Vermont Yankee spokesman, Larry Smith, the source of the leak was not yet known. Irwin and Governor Peter Shumlin expressed concern about the discovery.

===2012===
On January 19, 2012, Judge J. Garvan Murtha of United States District Court in Brattleboro ruled that the state of Vermont could not force Vermont Yankee to close down, as the legislation that attempted to do so was based on radiological safety arguments that are the exclusive concern of the NRC. The judge also held that the state cannot force the plant&#x27;s owner, Entergy, to sell electricity from the reactor to in-state utilities at reduced rates as a condition of continued operation.

===2013===
On June 7, 2013, Vermont&#x27;s Public Service Board issued Entergy a Certificate of Public Good to install an outdoor diesel generator to replace a tie line from the nearby hydroelectric station as its station blackout power source. The outdoor generator would only operate if the plant&#x27;s main emergency diesel generators located inside the turbine building were to fail. The outdoor generator is a self-contained unit that does not require cooling water from the plant&#x27;s cooling water systems. The new generator would power instrumentation in the control room and would be capable of providing emergency AC power to one train of each of the plant&#x27;s emergency cooling systems. On August 27, 2013, Entergy announced in a press release that it would close Vermont Yankee by the end of 2014. Among the reasons cited for the closure were ongoing low energy prices resulting from increased shale gas production, and the high operating costs of the plant.

==Protests and politics==
In 1971, Esther Poneck led the New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution in opposing construction of Vermont Yankee. In the 1970s and 1980s there were many anti-nuclear protests at Vermont Yankee which attempted to block access to the plant. More recent protests include:
*January 2006: 100 anti-nuclear supporters demonstrated at the front door of Entergy Nuclear, and eleven people were arrested for trespassing.
*April 2009: About 150 activists marched from Montpelier&#x27;s City Hall to the State House to urge lawmakers to back development of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power; the marchers had gathered 12,000 signatures in support of closing Vermont Yankee.
*January 2010: A coalition of anti-nuclear activists participated in a 126-mile walk from Brattleboro to Montpelier in an effort to block the re-licensing of Vermont Yankee. About 175 people took part in the March, some joining for the day and some for longer stretches.

In February 2010, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 against allowing the PSB to consider re-certifying the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Plant after 2012, citing radioactive tritium leaks, misstatements in testimony by plant officials, a cooling tower collapse in 2007, and other problems. Some businesses in Vermont were concerned there was an absence of a clear plan to replace the electricity generated by the plant. A spokesman for IBM, the largest private employer in the state, and the state&#x27;s largest consumer of electricity, said &quot;we have to be smarter than this&quot;. Larry Reilly, president of Central Vermont Public Service Corp., Vermont&#x27;s largest utility, stated in 2011 that he was untroubled by the prospect of closure: &quot;There&#x27;s plenty of power out there&quot;.&quot; Analysis by researchers at the University of Vermont estimated that an increase of &quot;slightly more than 3 percent&quot; in the retail price of electricity in Vermont would result from closing Vermont Yankee.

Ex-Governor Peter Shumlin was a prominent opponent of the Vermont Yankee. Two days after Shumlin was elected governor in November 2010, Entergy sought offers to purchase the plant. The company withdrew the plant from consideration for sale in late March 2011.

In March 2011, 600 people gathered for a weekend protest outside the Vermont Yankee plant, in the wake of the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. On March 22, 2011, the day after the NRC issued Vermont Yankee&#x27;s license extension, Vermont&#x27;s congressional delegation, Senator Patrick Leahy (D), Senator Bernie Sanders (I), and Representative Peter Welch (D), issued a joint statement decrying the NRC&#x27;s action and noting the similarity of Vermont Yankee to units then in partial meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power station, Japan.

In March 2012, more than 130 protesters were arrested at the corporate headquarters of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant, on the first day of the plant&#x27;s operation after the expiration of its original 40-year license.

In March 2013, more than 500 people, carrying banners and chanting &quot;shut it down&quot;, marched through downtown Brattleboro in protest against Vermont Yankee.

==Seismic risk==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission&#x27;s estimate of the risk each year of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at Vermont Yankee was 8.1 per year, or a chance of one incident occurring on average every 123,000 years, according to an NRC study published in August 2010, based upon a 2008 USGS survey.

==Surrounding population==
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity.

The 2010 U.S. population within of Vermont Yankee was 35,284, an increase of 1.4 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data. The 2010 U.S. population within was 1,533,472, an increase of 2.9 percent since 2000. Cities within 50 miles include Brattleboro (6 miles to city center); Keene, N.H., (16 miles to city center); Fitchburg, Mass., (38 miles to city center), Greenfield, Mass., and Northampton, Mass.

From April 2016, due to the continuing decommissioning process, the emergency planning zone was reduced to the site boundaries.

<text>&quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street&quot; is a short story by American writer Herman Melville, first serialized anonymously in two parts in the November and December 1853 issues of &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and reprinted with minor textual alterations in his &quot;The Piazza Tales&quot; in 1856. In the story, a Wall Street lawyer hires a new clerk, who after an initial bout of hard work, refuses to make copies or do any other task required of him, responding to any request with the words &quot;I would prefer not to.&quot;

The story likely takes place between 1848 and 1853, during the Antebellum period in American history.

Numerous critical essays have been published about the story, which scholar Robert Milder describes as &quot;unquestionably the masterpiece of the short fiction&quot; in the Melville canon.

== Plot ==
The narrator is an unnamed elderly lawyer who works with legal documents and has an office on Wall Street in New York. He already employs two scriveners, Turkey and Nippers, to copy documents by hand, but an increase in business leads him to advertise for a third. He hires the forlorn-looking Bartleby in the hope that his calmness will soothe the other two, each of whom displays an irascible temperament during an opposite half of the day. An errand boy nicknamed Ginger Nut completes the staff.

At first, Bartleby produces a large volume of high-quality work, but one day, when asked to help proofread a document, Bartleby answers with what soon becomes his perpetual response to every request: &quot;I would prefer not to.&quot; To the dismay of the narrator and the irritation of the other employees, Bartleby begins to perform fewer and fewer tasks and eventually none. He instead spends long periods of time staring out one of the office&#x27;s windows at a brick wall. The narrator makes several attempts to reason with Bartleby or to learn something about him, but never has any success. When the narrator stops by the office one Sunday morning, he discovers that Bartleby is living there. He is saddened by the thought of the life the young man must lead.

Tension builds as business associates wonder why Bartleby is always present in the office, yet does not appear to do any work. Sensing the threat to his reputation, but emotionally unable to evict Bartleby, the narrator moves his business to a different building. The new tenant of his old office comes to ask for help in removing Bartleby, and the narrator tells the man that he is not responsible for his former employee. A week or so after this, several other tenants of the narrator&#x27;s former office building come to him with their landlord because Bartleby is still making a nuisance of himself; though he has been put out of the office, he sits on the building stairs all day and sleeps in its doorway at night. The narrator agrees to visit Bartleby and attempts to reason with him. He suggests several jobs that Bartleby might try and even invites Bartleby to live with him until they figure out a better solution, but Bartleby declines these offers. The narrator leaves the building and flees the neighborhood for several days, so as not to be bothered by the landlord and tenants.

When the narrator returns to work, he learns that the landlord has called the police. The officers have arrested Bartleby and imprisoned him in the Tombs as a vagrant. He goes to visit Bartleby, who spurns him, and bribes a cook to make sure Bartleby gets enough food. The narrator returns a few days later to check on Bartleby and discovers him dead of starvation, having preferred not to eat.

Months later, the narrator hears a rumor that Bartleby had once worked in a dead-letter office and reflects on how this might have affected him. The story ends with the narrator saying, &quot;Ah Bartleby! Ah humanity!&quot;

== Composition ==
Melville&#x27;s major source of inspiration for the story was an advertisement for a new book, &quot;The Lawyer&#x27;s Story&quot;, printed in the &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Times&quot; on February 18, 1853. The book, published anonymously later that year, was written by popular novelist James A. Maitland. This advertisement included the complete first chapter, which started: &quot;In the summer of 1843, having an extraordinary quantity of deeds to copy, I engaged, temporarily, an extra copying clerk, who interested me considerably, in consequence of his modest, quiet, gentlemanly demeanor, and his intense application to his duties.&quot; Melville biographer Hershel Parker said nothing else in the chapter besides this &quot;remarkably evocative sentence&quot; was notable. Critic Andrew Knighton said Melville may have been influenced by an obscure work from 1846, Robert Grant White&#x27;s &quot;Law and Laziness: or, Students at Law of Leisure&quot;, which features an idle scrivener, while Christopher Sten suggests that Melville found inspiration in Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s essays, particularly &quot;The Transcendentalist&quot;, which shows parallels to &quot;Bartleby&quot;.

Melville may have written the story as an emotional response to the bad reviews garnered by &quot;&quot;, his preceding novel. Financial difficulties may also have played a part: &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; and &quot;Pierre&quot; sold so poorly that Melville was in debt to his publisher Harper and Brothers.

== Publication history ==
The story was first published anonymously as &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener: A Story of Wall-Street&quot; in two installments in &quot;Putnam&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, in November and December 1853. It was included in Melville&#x27;s &quot;The Piazza Tales&quot;, published by Dix and Edwards in the United States in May 1856 and in Britain in June.

== Interpretation ==
The narrator and the text do not explicitly explain the reason for Bartleby&#x27;s behavior, leaving it open to interpretation.

===Bartleby&#x27;s demeanour===
A 1978 article in &quot;ELH&quot; posits that Bartleby shows classic symptoms of depression, such as his lack of motivation. He is a passive person, and good at the work he agrees to do. He refuses to divulge any personal information to the narrator. Bartleby&#x27;s death is consistent with depression—having no motivation to survive, he refrains from eating until he dies.

===Function of narrator===
Bartleby has been interpreted as a &quot;psychological double&quot; for the narrator who criticizes the &quot;sterility, impersonality, and mechanical adjustments of the world which the lawyer inhabits.&quot; Until the end of the story, Bartleby&#x27;s background is unknown and may have sprung from the narrator&#x27;s mind. The narrator screens off Bartleby in a corner, which has been interpreted as symbolizing &quot;the lawyer&#x27;s compartmentalization of the unconscious forces which Bartleby represents.&quot;

Psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas says the main focus of the story is the narrator, whose &quot;willingness to tolerate [Bartleby&#x27;s] work stoppage is what needs to be explained ... As the story proceeds, it becomes increasingly clear that the lawyer identifies with his clerk. To be sure, it is an ambivalent identification, but that only makes it all the more powerful.&quot;

===Autobiography===
Scholars have long explored the possibility that Bartleby serves as an autobiographical portrait. Lawrence Buell suggested that the scrivener may reflect Melville as disenchanted writer or artist, Leo Marx connected the story&#x27;s theme of alienation with Melville&#x27;s experiences and feelings of isolation, and Giles Gunn posited that Melville&#x27;s personal struggles and disillusionment with the literary world influenced his portrayal of Bartleby as a withdrawn and passive character.

===Free will and ethics===
&quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; alludes to Jonathan Edwards&#x27;s &quot;Inquiry into the Freedom of the Will&quot; and Jay Leyda, in his introduction to &quot;The Complete Stories of Herman Melville,&quot; comments on the similarities between Bartleby and &quot;The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity&quot; by Joseph Priestley. Both Edwards and Priestley wrote about free will and determinism. Edwards states that free will requires the will to be isolated from the moment of decision, in which case Bartleby&#x27;s isolation from the world would allow him to be completely free. He has the ability to do whatever he pleases. The reference to Priestley and Edwards in connection with determinism may suggest that Bartleby&#x27;s exceptional exercise of his personal will, though it leads to his death, spares him from an externally determined fate.

&quot;Bartleby&quot; is also seen as an inquiry into ethics. Critic John Matteson sees the story (and other Melville works) as explorations of the changing meaning of 19th-century &quot;prudence&quot;. The story&#x27;s narrator &quot;struggles to decide whether his ethics will be governed by worldly prudence or Christian &quot;agape&quot;.&quot; He wants to be humane, as shown by his accommodations of the four staff and especially of Bartleby, but this conflicts with the newer, pragmatic and economically based notion of prudence supported by changing legal theory. The 1850 case &quot;Brown v. Kendall&quot;, three years before the story&#x27;s publication, was important in establishing the &quot;reasonable man&quot; standard in the United States, and emphasized the positive action required to avoid negligence. Bartleby&#x27;s passivity has no place in a legal and economic system that increasingly sides with the &quot;reasonable&quot; and economically active individual. His fate, an innocent decline into unemployment, prison, and starvation, dramatizes the effect of the new prudence on the economically inactive members of society.

== Reception ==
Though no great success at the time of publication, &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; is now among the most noted of American short stories. Albert Camus, in a personal letter to Liselotte Dieckmann published in &quot;The French Review&quot; in 1998, cites Melville as a key influence.

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

=== References to the story ===

==== Literature ====
* &quot;Bartleby: La formula della creazione&quot; (1993) by Giorgio Agamben and &quot;Bartleby, ou la formule&quot; by Gilles Deleuze are two philosophical essays reconsidering many of Melville&#x27;s ideas.
* Abdulrazak Gurnah references &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot; throughout his 2001 novel &quot;By the Sea.&quot; The protagonist, Saleh Omar, quotes Bartleby&#x27;s mantra to explain his decision to abstain from speaking English on seeking asylum in the UK.
* The story features prominently in Stephen King&#x27;s 1998 novel Bag of Bones. The final line of the book references Bartleby&#x27;s phrase &quot;I prefer not to&quot;.
* Jeff Smith&#x27;s comic-book series &quot;Bone&quot; features a &quot;rat creature&quot; named Bartleby who declines to partake in the violence and savagery of his feral brethren. The Melville connection is reinforced by the fact that &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; is the series protagonist&#x27;s favorite novel.

==== Film and television ====
* &quot;Bartleby (1970 film)&quot; is an adaptation of the story.
* In 2001, Crispin Glover starred in a modernized adaptation, &quot;Bartleby&quot;.
* In 2011, French director Jérémie Carboni made the documentary &quot;Bartleby en coulisses&quot; around Daniel Pennac&#x27;s reading of &quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&quot;.
* In 2018, Miles Luna, one of the lead creators of and a writer for &quot;RWBY&quot;, revealed that the creatures called Apathy that appeared in the episode &quot;Alone in the Woods&quot; of &quot;Volume 6&quot; were inspired by Bartleby&#x27;s apathetic behavior in the story. Additionally, the writer of a series of diaries in the episode is named Bartleby.

==== Other ====
*The electronic text archive bartleby.com is named &quot;after the humble character of its namesake scrivener, or copyist—publishes the classics of literature, nonfiction, and reference free of charge.&quot;
*The British newspaper magazine &quot;The Economist&quot; maintains a column named &quot;Bartleby&quot; focused on managers trying to understand how to motivate their employees and to empathize with employees who &quot;carry out their bosses&#x27; often-bewildering orders, even when they would &#x27;prefer not to&#x27;.&quot;
*The 92nd Street Y presented a livestreamed and on-demand reading of the story by actor Paul Giamatti in November 2020. A December 3, 2020, conversation between Giamatti and Andrew Delbanco is archived on YouTube.

<text>A political campaign is an organized effort which seeks to influence the decision making progress within a specific group. In democracies, political campaigns often refer to electoral campaigns, by which representatives are chosen or referendums are decided. In modern politics, the most high-profile political campaigns are focused on general elections and candidates for head of state or head of government, often a president or prime minister.

==Campaign message==
The message of the campaign contains the ideas that the candidate wants to share with the voters.
It is to get those who agree with their ideas to support them when running for a political position.
The message often consists of several talking points about policy issues.
The points summarize the main ideas of the campaign and are repeated frequently in order to create a lasting impression with the voters. In many elections, the opposition party will try to get the candidate &quot;off message&quot; by bringing up policy or personal questions that are not related to the talking points. Most campaigns prefer to keep the message broad in order to attract the most potential voters. A message that is too narrow can alienate voters or slow the candidate down with explaining details.
For example, in the 2008 American presidential election John McCain originally used a message that focused on his patriotism and political experience: &quot;Country First&quot;; later the message was changed to shift attention to his role as &quot;The Original Maverick&quot; within the political establishment. Barack Obama ran on a consistent, simple message of &quot;change&quot; throughout his campaign.

According to a 2024 study, political practitioners in the United States poorly predict what kind of messaging is persuasive to the public. The study found that practitioners performed barely better than chance at predicting persuasive effects; practitioners performed about as well as laypeople in predicting persuasive effects; and that practitioners’ experience, expertise, information environment, and demographics did affect their accuracy.

==Campaign finance==
Fundraising techniques include having the candidate call or meet with large donors, sending direct mail pleas to small donors, and courting interest groups who could end up spending millions on the race if it is significant to their interests.

==Organization==
In a modern political campaign, the campaign organization (or &quot;machine&quot;) will have a coherent structure of personnel in the same manner as any business of similar size.

===Campaign manager===
A campaign manager&#x27;s primary duty is to ensure marketing campaigns achieve their objectives. They work with the marketing manager to create, execute and monitor the performance of campaigns and provide all the resources required to meet sales targets.

===Political consultants===

Political consultants advise campaigns on virtually all of their activities, from research to field strategy. Consultants conduct candidate research, voter research, and opposition research for their clients.

===Activists===
In the context of political campaigns, activists are &quot;foot soldiers&quot; loyal to a campaign&#x27;s cause. As supporters, they promote the campaign as volunteer activists. Such volunteers and interns may take part in activities such as canvassing door-to-door and making phone calls on behalf of the campaigns.

==Techniques==
A campaign team (which may be as small as one inspired individual, or a heavily resourced group of professionals) must consider how to communicate the message of the campaign, recruit volunteers, and raise money. Campaign advertising draws on techniques from commercial advertising and propaganda, also entertainment and public relations, a mixture dubbed politainment. The avenues available to political campaigns when distributing their messages is limited by the law, available resources, and the imagination of the campaigns&#x27; participants. These techniques are often combined into a formal strategy known as the campaign plan. The plan takes account of a campaign&#x27;s goal, message, target audience, and resources available. The campaign will typically seek to identify supporters at the same time as getting its message across.
The modern, open campaign method was pioneered by Aaron Burr during the American presidential election of 1800.

Another modern campaign method by political scientist Joel Bradshaw points out four key propositions for developing a successful campaign strategy. &quot;First, in any election the electorate can be divided into three groups: the candidate&#x27;s base, the opponent&#x27;s base, and the undecided. Second, past election results, data from registered voter lists, and survey research make it possible to determine which people fall into each of these three groups. Third, it is neither possible nor necessary to get the support of all people. Fourth, and last, once a campaign has identified how to win, it can act to create the circumstances to bring about this victory. In order to succeed, campaigns should direct campaign resources – money, time, and message – to key groups of potential voters and nowhere else.&quot;

===Campaign communication===
Election campaign communication refers to party-controlled communication, e.g. campaign advertising, and party-uncontrolled communication, e.g. media coverage of elections.

===Campaign advertising===

Campaign advertising is the use of paid media (newspapers, radio, television, etc.) to influence the decisions made for and by groups. These ads are designed by political consultants and the campaign&#x27;s staff.

===Media management===
Media management refers to the ability of a political campaign to control the message that it broadcasts to the public. The forms of media used in political campaigns can be classified into two distinct categories: &quot;paid media&quot; or &quot;earned media&quot;. There are times where some campaigns get little attention, but the ones that do get highlighted for the effectiveness and dramatic events. In the book &quot;Campaigns and Elections&quot; by author John Sides, it says, &quot;For those that do get attention, media coverage often emphasizes what is new, dramatic, or scandalous. Unlike the candidates themselves, the news media or at least those outlets that strive for objectivity are not seeking to manipulate citizens into voting for their particular candidates.&quot; (Sides 2018).

Paid media refers to any media attention that is directly generated from spending. This form of media is commonly found through political advertisements and organized events. An advantage of paid media is that it allows political campaigns to tailor the messages they show the public and control when the public sees them. Campaigns often prioritize spending in contested regions and increase their paid media expenses as an election approaches. Electoral campaigns often conclude with a &quot;closing argument ad&quot;, an advertisement that summarizes the campaign&#x27;s core themes and explains the candidate&#x27;s vision for the future. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden&#x27;s &quot;Rising&quot; ad starts with him saying &quot;we&#x27;re in a battle for the soul of this nation&quot; and a worker in Donald Trump&#x27;s Pennsylvania ad stated &quot;that will be the end of my job and thousands of others&quot; if Trump lost.

Earned media describes free media coverage, often from news stories or social media posts. Unlike paid media, earned media does not incur an expense to the campaign. Earned media does not imply that the political campaign is mentioned in a positive manner. Political campaigns may often receive earned media from gaffes or scandals. In the 2016 United States Presidential Election, a majority of the media coverage surrounding Hillary Clinton was focused on her scandals, with the most prevalent topics being topics related to her emails.

Experts say that effective media management is an essential component of a successful political campaign. Studies show that candidates with higher media attention tend to have greater success in elections. Each form of media can influence the other. Paid media may raise the newsworthiness of an event which could lead to an increase in earned media. Campaigns may also spend money to emphasize stories circulating through media networks. Research suggests that neither form of media is inherently superior. A 2009 study found that media coverage was not significantly more effective than paid advertisements.


===Demonstrations===


===Modern technology and the internet===

The internet is now a core element of modern political campaigns. Communication technologies such as e-mail, websites, and podcasts for various forms of activism enable faster communications by citizen movements and deliver a message to a large audience. These Internet technologies are used for cause-related fundraising, lobbying, volunteering, community building, and organizing. Individual political candidates are also using the internet to promote their election campaign. In a study of Norwegian election campaigns, politicians reported they used social media for marketing and for dialogue with voters. Facebook was the primary platform for marketing and Twitter was used for more continuous dialogue.

Signifying the importance of internet political campaigning, Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign relied heavily on social media, Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and new media channels to engage voters, recruit campaign volunteers, and raise campaign funds. The campaign brought the spotlight on the importance of using internet in new-age political campaigning by utilizing various forms of social media and new media (including Facebook, YouTube and a custom generated social engine) to reach new target populations. The campaign&#x27;s social website, my.BarackObama.com, utilized a low cost and efficient method of mobilizing voters and increasing participation among various voter populations. This new media was incredibly successful at reaching the younger population while helping all populations organize and promote action. In the book Campaigns and Elections author John sides also speaks upon this on page 235 and says, &quot;Online communities can still promote involvement in campaigns: large experiments on Facebook found that users who saw that their Facebook friends had reported voting were themselves a bit more likely to turn out to vote. But there is also evidence that offering token public support for a cause on Facebook or Twitter may make one less likely to be involved in offline campaign activities&quot; (Sides 2018). 

Now, online election campaign information can be shared in a rich information format through campaign landing pages, integrating Google&#x27;s rich snippets, structured data, social media open graphs, and husting support file formats for YouTube like .sbv, , and . High proficiency and effective algorithmic integration will be the core factor in the framework. This technology integration helps campaign information reach a wide audience in split-seconds. This was successfully tested and implemented in the 2015 Aruvikkara election and the 2020 Kerala elections. Marcus Giavanni, social media consultant, blockchain developer and second place opponent in the 2015 Denver mayoral election, was first to file for the 2019 election. Marcus Giavanni used advanced algorithms, artificial intelligence, and voice indexing predictions to box in campaigns.

===Husting===
A husting, or the hustings, was originally a physical platform from which representatives presented their views or cast votes before a parliamentary or other election body. By metonymy, the term may now refer to any event, such as debates or speeches, during an election campaign where one or more of the representative candidates are present.

===Other techniques===
*Writing directly to members of the public (either via a professional marketing firm or, particularly on a small scale, by volunteers)
*By distributing leaflets or selling newspapers
*Through websites, online communities, and solicited or unsolicited bulk email
*Through a new technique known as microtargeting that helps identify and target small demographic slices of voters
*Through a whistlestop tour - a series of brief appearances in several small towns
*Hampering the ability of political competitors to campaign, by such techniques as counter-rallies, picketing of rival parties&#x27; meetings, or overwhelming rival candidates&#x27; offices with mischievous phone calls (most political parties in representative democracies publicly distance themselves from such disruptive and morale-affecting tactics, with the exception of those parties self-identifying as activist)

==Campaign types==

===Informational campaign===

An informational campaign is a political campaign designed to raise public awareness and support for the positions of a candidate (or her/his party). It is more intense than a paper campaign, which consists of little more than filing the necessary papers to get on the ballot, but is less intense than a competitive campaign, which aims to actually win election to the office. An informational campaign typically focuses on low-cost outreach such as news releases, getting interviewed in the paper, making a brochure for door to door distribution, organizing poll workers, etc.

===Paper campaign===
A paper campaign is a political campaign in which the candidate only files the necessary paperwork to appear on the ballot. The purpose of such a token effort may be simply to increase name awareness of a minor political party, to give voters of a certain ideology an opportunity to vote accordingly, or to ensure that the party has candidates in every constituency. It can be a cost-effective means of attracting media coverage. An informational campaign, by contrast, may involve news releases, newspaper interviews, door-to-door campaigning, and organizing polls. As the level of seriousness rises, the marginal cost of reaching more people rises accordingly, due to the high cost of TV commercials, paid staff, etc. which are used by competitive campaigns. Paper candidates do not expect to be elected and usually run simply as a way of helping the more general campaign. However, an unexpected surge in support for the party may result in many paper candidates being unexpectedly elected, as for example happened to the New Democratic Party in Quebec during the 2011 federal election.

== Effects ==
A 2018 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that campaigns have &quot;an average effect of zero in general elections&quot;. The study found two instances where campaigning was effective: &quot;First, when candidates take unusually unpopular positions and campaigns invest unusually heavily in identifying persuadable voters. Second, when campaigns contact voters long before election day and measure effects immediately — although this early persuasion decays.&quot;

One reason why it is hard to judge the effectiveness of an election campaign is because many people know who they want to vote for long before the campaigns are started. Voters are more likely to vote for a nominee based on whose values align closest with theirs. Studies suggest that party flips come from the analysis of how a voter sees their parties performance in the years before a campaign even begins.

Another study suggests that at the 2017 Austrian legislative election, 31% of voters admitted to either developing of changing their party preferences during the election campaign. The study provides data that shows how the main parties within Austria had differing levels of voters flipping toward them, thus proving that an election campaign has some level of effectiveness that differs between parties, depending on factors such as media presence.

=== Spending ===
In presidential campaigns in the United States, research indicates that a $10 million advantage in spending in an individual states leads to approximately 27,000 more votes for the campaign in the state, which can be sufficient to win a close race. In down-ballot races, spending matters more. Scholars have estimated that a $2 million advantage can net a Senate campaign 10,000 votes.

=== Presidential campaigns ===
A large body of political science research emphasizes how &quot;fundamentals&quot; – the state of the economy, whether the country is at war, how long the president&#x27;s party has held the office, and which candidate is more ideologically moderate – predict presidential election outcomes. However, campaigns may be necessary to enlighten otherwise uninformed voters about the fundamentals, which thus become increasingly predictive of preferences as the campaign progresses. Research suggests that &quot;the 2012 presidential campaigns increased turnout in highly targeted states by 7–8 percentage points, on average, indicating that modern campaigns can significantly alter the size and composition of the voting population&quot;.

==== National conventions ====
A consensus in the political science literature holds that national conventions usually have a measurable effect on presidential elections that is relatively resistant to decay.

==== Presidential and vice-presidential debates ====
Research is mixed on the precise impact of debates. Rather than encourage viewers to update their political views in accordance with the most persuasive arguments, viewers instead update their views to merely reflect what their favored candidate is saying.

==== Presidential primaries ====
The fundamentals matter less in the outcome of presidential primaries. One prominent theory holds that the outcome of presidential primaries is largely determined by the preferences of party elites. Presidential primaries are therefore less predictive, as various types of events may impact elites&#x27; perception of the viability of candidates. Gaffes, debates and media narratives play a greater role in primaries than in presidential elections.

=== Strategies ===

Traditional ground campaigning and voter contacts remain the most effective strategies. Some research suggests that knocking on doors can increase turnout by as much as 10% and phone calls by as much as 4%. One study suggests that lawn signs increase vote share by 1.7 percentage points. A review of more than 200 get-out-the-vote experiments finds that the most effective tactics are personal: Door-to-door canvassing increases turnout by an average of about 2.5 percentage points; volunteer phone calls raise it by about 1.9 points, compared to 1.0 points for calls from commercial phone banks; automated phone messages are ineffective. Using out-of-state volunteers for canvassing is less effective in increasing turnout than using local and trained volunteers.

There are many different types of strategies that are also used during these campaigns that target certain people and try to win them over. people are also paid to help get candidates to vote for a certain side. In the book &quot;Campaigns and Elections&quot;, author John Sides says, &quot;Campaigns involve a variety of actors. More visible are the candidates themselves. Their strategic choices involve every facet of a campaign: whether to run in the first place, what issues to emphasize, what specific messages or themes to discuss, which kinds of media to use, and which citizens to target.&quot; 

According to political scientists Donald Green and Alan Gerber, it costs $31 to produce a vote going door to door, $91-$137 to produce a vote by sending out direct mailers, $47 per vote from leafletting, $58-$125 per vote from commercial phone banking, and $20-$35 per vote from voluntary phone banking. A 2018 study in the &quot;American Economic Review&quot; found that door-to-door canvassing on behalf of the Francois Hollande campaign in the 2012 French presidential election &quot;did not affect turnout, but increased Hollande&#x27;s vote share in the first round and accounted for one fourth of his victory margin in the second. Visits&#x27; impact persisted in later elections, suggesting a lasting persuasion effect.&quot; According to a 2018 study, repeated get-out-the-vote phone calls had diminishing effects but each additional phone call increased the probability to vote by 0.6-1.0 percentage points. Another 2018 study found that &quot;party leaflets boost turnout by 4.3 percentage points while canvassing has a small additional effect (0.6 percentage points)&quot; in a United Kingdom election.

A 2016 study found that visits by a candidate to states have modest effects: &quot;visits are most effective in influencing press coverage at the national level and within battleground states. Visits&#x27; effects on voters themselves, however, are much more modest than consultants often claim, and visits appear to have no effects outside the market that hosts a visit.&quot; The authors of the study argue that it would be more effective for campaigns to go to the pockets of the country where wealthy donors are (for fundraising) and hold rallies in the populous states both to attract national press and raise funds. A 2005 study found that campaign visits had no statistically significant effect, after controlling for other factors, on voter turnout in the 1992, 1996, and 2000 elections. On the other hand, a 2017 paper of the 1948 presidential election provides &quot;strong evidence that candidate visits can influence electoral returns&quot;. Other research also provides evidence that campaign visits increase vote share.

Campaigns may also rely on strategically placed field offices to acquire votes. The Obama 2008 campaign&#x27;s extensive use of field offices has been credited as crucial to winning in the states of Indiana and North Carolina. Each field office that the Obama campaign opened in 2012 gave him approximately a 0.3% greater vote share. According to one study, the cost per vote by having a field office is $49.40. A 2024 study found &quot;that campaign offices help candidates in small but meaningful ways, delivering modest but quantifiable increases in candidate vote share in the areas where they open... Field offices can increase candidate vote share, but their value differs across parties: Democrats benefit more in battleground states and populous areas, while Republicans’ largely rural base of support in recent years provides challenges for maximizing the benefits of in-person organizing.&quot; 

According to a 2020 study, campaign spending on messaging to voters affects voter support for candidates. Another 2020 study found that political advertising had small effects regardless of context, message, sender, and receiver. A 2022 study found that voters are persuadable to switch support for candidates when they are exposed to new information.

Political science research generally finds negative advertisement (which has increased over time) to be ineffective both at reducing the support and turnout for the opponent. A 2021 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that television campaign ads do affect election outcomes, in particular in down-ballot races. According to political scientists Stephen Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar, negative ads do succeed at driving down overall turnout though. A 2019 study of online political advertising conducted by a party in the 2016 Berlin state election campaign found that the online-ad campaign &quot;increased the party&#x27;s vote share by 0.7 percentage points&quot; and that factual ads were more effective than emotional ads.

==History==

Political campaigns have existed as long as there have been informed citizens to campaign amongst. Democratic societies have regular election campaigns, but political campaigning can occur on particular issues even in non-democracies so long as freedom of expression is allowed. Often mass campaigns are started by the less privileged or anti-establishment viewpoints (as against more powerful interests whose first resort is lobbying). The phenomenon of political campaigns are tightly tied to lobby groups and political parties.

The first modern campaign is often described as William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s Midlothian campaign in 1878–80, although there may be earlier recognizably modern examples from the 19th century. The 1896 William McKinley presidential campaign laid the groundwork for modern campaigns.

=== History of election campaigns in America ===
In the 19th Century, American presidential candidates seldom traveled or made speeches in support of their candidacies. Through 1904, only eight major presidential candidates did so (William Henry Harrison in 1840, Winfield Scott in 1852, Stephen A. Douglas in 1860, Horatio Seymour in 1868, Horace Greeley in 1872, James A. Garfield in 1880, James G. Blaine in 1884, William Jennings Bryan in 1896 and 1900, and Alton B. Parker in 1904), whereas every major presidential candidate since then has done so, with the sole exception of Calvin Coolidge in 1924. In 1896, William McKinley recruited the help of Marcus A. Hanna. Hanna devised a plan to have voters come to McKinley. McKinley won the race with 51% of the votes.

The development of new technologies has completely changed the way political campaigns are run. In the late 20th Century, campaigns shifted into television and radio broadcasts. The early 2000s brought interactive websites. By 2008 the world of campaigns was available to millions of people through the internet and social media programs. 2008 marked a new era of digital elections because of the fast-paced movement of information.

<text>An iodide ion is I−. Compounds with iodine in formal oxidation state −1 are called iodides. In everyday life, iodide is most commonly encountered as a component of iodized salt, which many governments mandate. Worldwide, iodine deficiency affects two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability.

==Structure and characteristics of inorganic iodides==
Iodide is one of the largest monatomic anions. It is assigned a radius of around 206 picometers. For comparison, the lighter halides are considerably smaller: bromide (196 pm), chloride (181 pm), and fluoride (133 pm). In part because of its size, iodide forms relatively weak bonds with most elements.

Most iodide salts are soluble in water, but often less so than the related chlorides and bromides. Iodide, being large, is less hydrophilic compared to the smaller anions. One consequence of this is that sodium iodide is highly soluble in acetone, whereas sodium chloride is not. The low solubility of silver iodide and lead iodide reflects the covalent character of these metal iodides. A test for the presence of iodide ions is the formation of yellow precipitates of these compounds upon treatment of a solution of silver nitrate or lead(II) nitrate.

Aqueous solutions of iodide salts dissolve iodine better than pure water. This effect is due to the formation of the triiodide ion, which is brown:
:I− + I2 ⇌ 

===Redox, including antioxidant properties===
Iodide salts are mild reducing agents and many react with oxygen to give iodine. A reducing agent is a chemical term for an antioxidant. Its antioxidant properties can be expressed quantitatively as a redox potential:

:2I− ⇌  I2 + 2e−&quot;E&quot;° = 0.54 volts (versus SHE)

Because iodide is easily oxidized, some enzymes readily convert it into electrophilic iodinating agents, as required for the biosynthesis of myriad iodide-containing natural products. Iodide can function as an antioxidant reducing species that can destroy ozone and reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide:
:2 I− + peroxidase + H2O2 + tyrosine, histidine, lipid, etc. → iodo-compounds + H2O + 2 e−

==Representative iodides==
==Natural occurrence==
Iodargyrite—natural, crystalline silver iodide—is the most common iodide mineral currently known. Iodide anions may sometimes also be found combined with mercury, copper and lead, but minerals with such compositions are even more scarce.

==Other oxoanions==
Iodine can assume oxidation states of −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. A number of neutral iodine oxides are also known.

<text>Reginald Ernest Prentice, Baron Prentice, PC (16 July 1923 – 18 January 2001) was a British politician who held ministerial office in both Labour and Conservative Party governments. He was the most senior Labour figure ever to defect to the Conservative Party.

==Education and war service==
Reg Prentice was born in Croydon, Surrey, and educated at Whitgift School in South Croydon, then at the London School of Economics. He served in Austria and Italy during World War II.

==Early politics==
Prentice joined the staff of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) in 1950.

He was a councillor for Whitehorse Manor in the then-County Borough of Croydon from 1949, having stood unsuccessfully in Thornton Heath ward in 1947. He served on the Housing, Libraries, Planning &amp; Development, Water and Reconstruction Committees.

He first stood, unsuccessfully, for parliament in Croydon North in 1950 and 1951, then Streatham in 1955. As Labour Member of Parliament from 1957 for East Ham North, later Newham North East, he was a minister of state in Harold Wilson&#x27;s first government at Education and Science (1964–66), then as Minister of Public Buildings and Works (1966–67), and finally was put in charge of the still-new Ministry of Overseas Development (1967–69).

In the 1971 Shadow Cabinet election, Prentice just missed out on being elected, finishing in 13th place in the ballot for 12 available places. However, in April 1972 the resignations from the shadow cabinet of Harold Lever and George Thomson saw Prentice and 14th placed candidate John Silkin join the body in their place. At the next shadow cabinet election, Prentice topped the poll and he was again re-elected in 1973, this time finishing in third place.

When Labour regained power, he was Secretary of State for Education and Science between 1974 and 1975, subsequently becoming Minister for Overseas Development with a seat in the cabinet until 1976.

In 1975, after his Constituency Labour Party had been infiltrated by Trotskyist Militants, he was deselected. He appealed unsuccessfully from the rostrum of the Labour Party Conference for the National Executive Committee to overturn their endorsement of his deselection.

==Switch of party==
In 1977, Prentice left the Labour Party after a series of battles with left-wing constituency activists and joined the Conservative Party.

He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Daventry in the 1979 general election. Lady Hesketh was instrumental in him standing for Daventry. He was a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Security in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government between 1979 and 1981. He left the government owing to ill health. He was knighted in 1987, the year he stepped down as an MP. On 30 January 1992, he was created Life Peer as Baron Prentice, of Daventry in the County of Northamptonshire.

In the last few years before his death at age 77, he was President of the Devizes Conservative Association.

==Death and legacy==
Prentice died at his home in Mildenhall, Wiltshire. His daughter, Christine, followed her father as a London Borough of Croydon councillor for Coulsdon East ward from 1992 to 1998.

A biography, which provides an in-depth account of Prentice&#x27;s party-political transition during the 1970s, was published in 2015: Geoff Horn, &quot;Crossing the floor: Reg Prentice and the crisis of British social democracy&quot;.

<doc id="519814" wikidata="Q4692573" url="?curid=519814" title="Agincourt, Toronto">
<text>Agincourt () is a neighbourhood and former village in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Agincourt is located in northeast Toronto, along Sheppard Avenue between Kennedy and Markham Roads (north-south includes lands between Highway 401 and Finch Avenue). Before the creation of the &quot;megacity&quot; of Toronto in 1998, the area was part of Scarborough. It is officially recognized by the City of Toronto as occupying the neighbourhoods of Agincourt South–Malvern West and Agincourt North.

The name Agincourt is often used to refer to a larger area of northwest Scarborough rather than just the officially recognized neighbourhood. The area to the west of Agincourt, officially named Tam O&#x27;Shanter–Sullivan is often included as part of Agincourt, and the Agincourt Mall is located in Tam O&#x27;Shanter.

The section of Agincourt west of Midland Avenue belongs to the electoral district of Scarborough—Agincourt, while the section to the east is part of Scarborough North (federal, previously Scarborough—Rouge River) or Scarborough—Rouge River (provincial, until the 2018 provincial election, when it will be replaced with Scarborough North).

==History==

Agincourt was once referred to as &quot;hero town&quot; by the citizens that lived there. The village of Agincourt was officially founded with the establishment of the Agincourt post office, opened in June 1858 by John Hill. The name of the settlement was after the site of Henry V&#x27;s decisive English victory over French forces in 1415. Local legend has it that the town&#x27;s name was chosen when Hill requested that the town be given a post office, and the French-Canadian Postmaster agreed, on the condition that it be given a French name, with &#x27;Agincourt&#x27; chosen to undermine the Postmaster&#x27;s intention. The site of the 1415 battle is now known as Azincourt: the namesake of today&#x27;s Agincourt, Ontario should not be confused with Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle. The original crossroads of Agincourt is located at Midland Avenue and Sheppard and served a rural agricultural population.
A Presbyterian church (from France) was built on the north-east corner, which is today&#x27;s Knox United Church. In addition, an Agincourt Public School was built in 1914, which has evolved over time into Agincourt Junior Public School. A secondary school that later evolved into Agincourt Collegiate Institute, was established in 1915 on the second floor of the same building. From 1954 to 1998, the schools were a part of the Scarborough Board of Education.

Two railway stations were constructed in the second half of the 19th century at Agincourt. One was built just west of the crossroads as part of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway line heading north from Scarborough Junction on the Toronto – Montreal mainline, and greatly improved access. The line eventually became part of Canadian National Railways, and the station operates today as Agincourt Station on the GO Transit Stouffville commuter rail route. A second station was built east of the crossroads, northside of Sheppard Avenue and west of Brimley Road, on what is today CP Rail track that runs from downtown Toronto diagonally northeast through the neighbourhood. Commuter rail service to Toronto&#x27;s Union Station was offered by the CPR from various service routes such as Lake Ontario Shore Line and Toronto-Peterboro Dayliner (1950s). CP passenger service was discontinued in 1982 but revived briefly in 1985 before being cancelled for good in 1990. The line branches east of a marshalling yard, built by CP in the 1960s between McCowan and Markham Roads on the east of the neighbourhood, into the (Peterborough–) Havelock and Belleville (– Montreal) subdivisions. The neighbourhood saw an influx of Chinese Canadians move into the area during the 1980s.

Agincourt saw an influx of Hong Kong Chinese and Taiwanese emigrants during the 1980s, especially in the area along Sheppard Avenue near Midland Avenue. Since the development of Chinese-themed shopping centres in the 1980s, it has become a booming suburban Toronto Chinatown and was the vanguard for the proliferation of &quot;Chinese malls&quot;, catering specifically to the Chinese community across the GTA.

==Economy==
Agincourt Mall, an enclosed mall, began a redevelopment in 2018, and is the second-largest active residential application in Toronto.

==History==
Anzin was once the centre of important coal mines of the Valenciennes basin belonging to the Anzin Company, the formation of which dates to 1717. The commune&#x27;s first coal layer of the area in 1734. The company of the mines of Anzin (Compagnie des mines d&#x27;Anzin) was created in 1757. In 1884 these mines were visited by Émile Zola, who based his novel &quot;Germinal&quot; upon his observations. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the metallurgical industries of the place were extensive, and included iron and copper founding and the manufacture of steam-engines, machinery, chain-cables and a great variety of heavy iron goods.

<doc id="519839" wikidata="Q3806582" url="?curid=519839" title="James H. Wilson">
<text>James Harrison Wilson (September 2, 1837 – February 23, 1925) was an American military officer, topographic engineer and a Major General in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He initially served as an aide to Major General George B. McClellan during the Maryland Campaign before joining Major General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s army in the Western Theater, where he was promoted to brigadier general. In 1864, he transferred from engineering to the cavalry, where he displayed notable leadership in many engagements of the Overland Campaign. However, his attempt to destroy Lee’s supply lines failed when he was routed by a much smaller force of Confederate irregulars.

Returning to the Western Theater, Wilson became one of the few Union commanders to defeat Confederate cavalier Nathan Bedford Forrest in battle. He achieved this feat at the Battle of Franklin in November 1864 and again during his raid through Alabama and Georgia in March and April 1865. Wilson ended the war with his men capturing both Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Andersonville Prison commandant Henry Wirz in May 1865. At the time of his death in 1925, he was the fourth-to-last living Union Civil War general.

==Early life and engineering==
Wilson was born in Shawneetown, Illinois. He attended McKendree College for a year and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1860, sixth in his class of 41, receiving a commission as a brevet second lieutenant in the Topographical Engineers. His initial assignment was assistant topographical engineer of the Department of Oregon at Fort Vancouver.

==Civil War==

===Engineering assignments===
After the start of the Civil War, Wilson received promotions to second and first lieutenant and became the topographical engineer for the Port Royal Expeditionary Force, from September 1861 to March 1862. As the topographical engineer for the Department of the South, he took part in the Battle of Fort Pulaski at the mouth of the Savannah River and received a brevet promotion to major in the regular army for his service. He transferred to the Army of the Potomac in April 1862 and served as its topographic engineer, but also as an aide-de-camp to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. He served under McClellan during the Maryland Campaign and was present at the battles of South Mountain and Antietam.

Wilson was transferred to the Western Theater and joined Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee as a lieutenant colonel and topographical engineer. During the Vicksburg Campaign, he was the inspector general of Grant&#x27;s army. On October 30, 1863, he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers. He continued on staff duty during the Battle of Chattanooga and was chief engineer of the force sent to relieve Knoxville under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman.

===Cavalry commands===

In 1864, Wilson switched from engineering to the cavalry. On February 17, 1864, he was assigned as chief of the Cavalry Bureau in Washington, D.C. He was an excellent administrator and organizer, but his true talents turned out to be as a combat leader. Grant promoted him to brevet major general on May 6, 1864, and had him assigned to command a division of cavalry under Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan, which he did with boldness and skill in numerous fights of the Overland Campaign and in the Valley Campaigns of 1864.

General Wilson&#x27;s ill-fated joint adventure with General Brigadier General August V. Kautz was launched through General Grant&#x27;s strategy of interdicting Robert E. Lee&#x27;s supply lines to Petersburg, Virginia. If this could be done, Lee would be compelled to abandon Petersburg. General Wilson was ordered to conduct a cavalry raid that would destroy the tracks of the South Side and Richmond &amp; Danville railroads, and to destroy the key R&amp;D railroad bridge over the Staunton River. The raid began on June 22, 1864, with over 5,000 Cavalry troops and 16 pieces of artillery. During the first three days of their raid, Wilson&#x27;s cavalry tore up 60 miles of track and burned two trains and several railroad stations. Confederate General W. H. F. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee pursued the Union raid, but was ineffective. The audacious raid seemed to be wildly successful, though not uncontested, and the Staunton River Bridge loomed as the great objective. The railroad bridge was over a small but deep river, the Staunton. The Confederacy had sensed its strategic importance, putting a small fort there under Captain Benjamin Farinholt, and his 296 reserve troops. A valiant stand by local volunteers of old men and boys, with help from surrounding counties, gathered almost a force of nearly 1,000, which halted the 5,000 well-armed troops. Wilson’s cavalry fought the action dismounted. &quot;Rooney&quot; Lee&#x27;s cavalry came up during the engagement&#x27;s end, and routed Wilson&#x27;s troops. There has been speculation that this damaged an otherwise brilliant career for Wilson.

However, just before Sheridan&#x27;s decisive Battle of Cedar Creek in October 1864, Wilson was upgraded to brevet major general of volunteers and transferred back to the West to become chief of cavalry for the Military Division of the Mississippi under Sherman.

As cavalry chief, he trained Sherman&#x27;s cavalry (under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick) for the March to the Sea. Rather than accompanying Sherman, however, he and 17,000 troopers were attached to Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland for the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in November and December 1864. His repulse of a flanking attack by Maj. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was instrumental in saving the Union Army at the Battle of Franklin; Wilson was one of only a few Union officers to best the legendary Southern cavalryman. He was promoted to brevet brigadier general in the regular army for his service in the Battle of Nashville. He led the successful Wilson&#x27;s Raid through Alabama and Georgia, defeating the smaller force of Forrest and capturing Selma, Alabama, along with four other fortified cities. In this campaign, he commanded the troops that burned most of the buildings of the University of Alabama. On Easter Day, 1865, his troops assaulted and captured the city of Columbus, Georgia. His men did enormous damage to the military infrastructure of the South, but they did it with a sense of discipline that usually prevented looting and other collateral damage to civilian property. He was promoted to brevet major general in the regular army for his performance at Selma and received his full promotion to major general on May 6, 1865. In central Georgia, the cavalrymen under Wilson&#x27;s command captured Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and Captain Henry Wirz, the commandant of Andersonville, as he fled through Georgia in May 1865. Wilson&#x27;s administration of post-war Georgia was regarded, in some cases, as enlightened. In his &quot;History of the State of Georgia from 1850 to 1881&quot;, the historian I.W. Avery remarks: In many particulars the Federal soldiers acted very cleverly. Gen. [James H.] Wilson turned over to Gen. Ira Foster the Confederate mules, horses, wagons, and harness, for distribution to the poor, and Col. J.H.R Washington of Macon, was associated with Gen. Foster to aid in the distribution. On June 24, 1865, in General Order #31, General Wilson expressed appreciation to Foster and Washington, and relieved them of their authority, placing the task with Capt. R. Carter, A.Q.M., Cavalry Corps Military Division of the Mississippi.

At the end of the war, Wilson reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was assigned to the newly created 35th U.S. Infantry, but his duty assignments continued to be in the Corps of Engineers until he resigned from the Army in December 1870.

==Later life and wars==
After he left the Army, Wilson worked as a railroad construction engineer and executive. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware, in 1883. For the next 15 years he devoted his time to business, travel, and public affairs, and wrote on a number of subjects.

Wilson returned to the Army in 1898 for the Spanish–American War, and served as a major general of volunteers in Cuba and Puerto Rico. He also saw service in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1901 as brigadier-general. Retiring from the Army, in 1902 he represented President Theodore Roosevelt at the coronation of Edward VII of the United Kingdom.

He was a Veteran Companion of the District of Columbia Commander of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) – a military society of Union officers and their descendants. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 12106.

Wilson died in Wilmington, Delaware, in 1925, with only three Union Civil War generals living longer. He is buried in the Old Swedes Churchyard in Wilmington.

<text>In organic chemistry, a nucleophilic addition (AN) reaction is an addition reaction where a chemical compound with an electrophilic double or triple bond reacts with a nucleophile, such that the double or triple bond is broken. Nucleophilic additions differ from electrophilic additions in that the former reactions involve the group to which atoms are added accepting electron pairs, whereas the latter reactions involve the group donating electron pairs. 

== Addition to carbon–heteroatom double bonds ==
Nucleophilic addition reactions of nucleophiles with electrophilic double or triple bond (π bonds) create a new carbon center with two additional single, or σ, bonds. Addition of a nucleophile to carbon–heteroatom double or triple bonds such as &gt;C=O or -C≡N show great variety. These types of bonds are polar (have a large difference in electronegativity between the two atoms); consequently, their carbon atoms carries a partial positive charge. This makes the molecule an electrophile, and the carbon atom the electrophilic center; this atom is the primary target for the nucleophile. Chemists have developed a geometric system to describe the approach of the nucleophile to the electrophilic center, using two angles, the Bürgi–Dunitz and the Flippin–Lodge angles after scientists that first studied and described them.
This type of reaction is also called a 1,2-nucleophilic addition. The stereochemistry of this type of nucleophilic attack is not an issue, when both alkyl substituents are dissimilar and there are not any other controlling issues such as chelation with a Lewis acid, the reaction product is a racemate. Addition reactions of this type are numerous. When the addition reaction is accompanied by an elimination the reaction is a type of substitution or an addition-elimination reaction.

===Addition to carbonyl groups===
With a carbonyl compound as an electrophile, the nucleophile can be:
* water in hydration to a geminal diol (hydrate)
* an alcohol in acetalisation to an acetal
* a hydride in reduction to an alcohol
* an amine with formaldehyde and a carbonyl compound in the Mannich reaction
* an enolate ion in an aldol reaction or Baylis–Hillman reaction
* an organometallic nucleophile in the Grignard reaction or the related Barbier reaction or a Reformatskii reaction
* ylides such as a Wittig reagent or the Corey–Chaykovsky reagent or α-silyl carbanions in the Peterson olefination
* a phosphonate carbanion in the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction
* a pyridine zwitterion in the Hammick reaction
* an acetylide in alkynylation reactions.
* a cyanide ion in cyanohydrin reactions

In many nucleophilic reactions, addition to the carbonyl group is very important. In some cases, the C=O double bond is reduced to a C-O single bond when the nucleophile bonds with carbon. For example, in the cyanohydrin reaction a cyanide ion forms a C-C bond by breaking the carbonyl&#x27;s double bond to form a cyanohydrin.

===Addition to nitriles===
With nitrile electrophiles, nucleophilic addition take place by:
* hydrolysis of a nitrile to form an amide or a carboxylic acid
* organozinc nucleophiles in the Blaise reaction
* alcohols in the Pinner reaction.
* the (same) nitrile α-carbon in the Thorpe reaction. The intramolecular version is called the Thorpe–Ziegler reaction.
* Grignard reagents to form imines. The route affords ketones following hydrolysis or primary amines following imine reduction.

== Addition to carbon–carbon double bonds ==
When a nucleophile X− adds to an alkene, the driving force is the transfer of negative charge from X to the electron-poor unsaturated -C=C- system. This occurs through the formation of a covalent bond between X and one carbon atom, concomitant with the transfer of electron density from the pi bond onto the other carbon atom (step 1). During a telescoped second reaction or workup (step 2), the resulting negatively charged carbanion combines with an electrophilic Y to form the second covalent bond.

Unsubstituted and unstrained alkenes are typically insufficiently polar to admit nucleophilic addition, but a few exceptions are known. 

The strain energy in fullerenes weakens their double-bonds; addition thereto is the Bingel reaction.

Bonds adjacent to an electron-withdrawing substituent (e.g. a carbonyl group, nitrile, or fluoride) readily admit nucleophilic addition. In this process, conjugate addition, the nucleophile X adds β to the substituent, because then said substituent inductively stabilizes the product&#x27;s negative charge. Aromatic substituents, although typically electrophilic, can also sometimes stabilize negative charge; for example, styrene reacts in toluene with sodium to give 1,3-diphenylpropane:

<doc id="519847" wikidata="Q1791012" url="?curid=519847" title="Timeline of Cassini–Huygens">
<text>This article provides a timeline of the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; mission (commonly called &quot;Cassini&quot;). &quot;Cassini&quot; was a collaboration between the United States&#x27; NASA, the European Space Agency (&quot;ESA&quot;), and the Italian Space Agency (&quot;ASI&quot;) to send a probe to study the Saturnian system, including the planet, its rings, and its natural satellites. The Flagship-class uncrewed robotic spacecraft comprised both NASA&#x27;s &quot;Cassini&quot; probe, and ESA&#x27;s &quot;Huygens&quot; lander which was designed to land on Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan. &quot;Cassini&quot; was the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter its orbit. The craft were named after astronomers Giovanni Cassini and Christiaan Huygens.

Launched aboard a Titan IVB/Centaur on 15 October 1997, &quot;Cassini&quot; had a nearly 20-year life span, with 13 of these years spent orbiting Saturn. The voyage to Saturn included flybys of Venus (April 1998 and June 1999), Earth (August 1999), the asteroid 2685 Masursky, and Jupiter (December 2000). The probes entered orbit on 1 July 2004, and the mission ended on 15 September 2017, when &quot;Cassini&quot; flew into Saturn&#x27;s upper atmosphere in order to prevent any risk of contaminating Saturn&#x27;s moons, some of which have active environments that could potentially bear life. The mission is widely perceived to have succeeded beyond expectations. &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot; has been described by NASA&#x27;s Planetary Science Division Director as a &quot;mission of firsts&quot;, that has revolutionized human understanding of the Saturnian system, including its moons and rings, and our understanding of where life might be found in the Solar System. 

&quot;Cassini&quot;″s primary mission lasted for four years, from June 2004 to May 2008. The mission was extended for another two years until September 2010, under the name of &quot;Cassini Equinox Mission&quot;. The mission was extended a second and final time with the &quot;Cassini Solstice Mission&quot;, lasting until the spacecraft&#x27;s destruction in September 2017.

The &quot;Huygens&quot; module traveled with &quot;Cassini&quot; until its separation from the probe on 25 December 2004; it was successfully landed by parachute on Titan on 14 January 2005. It successfully returned data to Earth for around 90 minutes, using the orbiter as a relay. This was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer Solar System and the first landing on a moon other than our own. 

At the end of its mission, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft executed the &quot;Grand Finale&quot; of its mission: several risky passes through the gaps between Saturn and Saturn&#x27;s inner rings. The purpose of this phase was to maximize &quot;Cassini&quot; scientific outcome before the spacecraft was destroyed. The atmospheric entry of &quot;Cassini&quot; effectively ended the mission, although data analysis and production is still ongoing.

==Launch and cruise phase (1997–2003)==

15 October 1997 01:43 Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) – &quot;Cassini&quot; launched at 08:43 UTC inside Titan IVB/Centaur rocket at Cape Canaveral.

26 April 1998 06:52 PDT – Gravity-assisted flyby of Venus at 284 km, receiving a boost in speed of about 7 kilometers per second.

3 December 1998 22:06 PST – &quot;Cassini&quot; fired its main rocket engine for 90 minutes, setting the spacecraft on course for its second Venus flyby in 1999. The engine burn slowed the spacecraft by close to 450 meters per second (about 1,006 miles per hour) relative to the Sun. &quot;Cassini&quot;″s speed went from 67,860 kilometers per hour (42,168 miles per hour) at the start of the maneuver to 66,240 kilometers per hour (41,161 miles per hour) at the end of the engine firing. 

24 June 1999 13:30 PDT – Gravity-assisted flyby of Venus at 623 km.

18 August 1999 03:28 UTC − Gravity-assisted flyby of Earth. An hour 20 minutes before closest approach, &quot;Cassini&quot; made the closest approach to the Moon at 377,000 km, and took a series of calibration images.
The spacecraft flew past Earth at a distance of , passing most closely above the eastern South Pacific at . &quot;Cassini&quot; received a 5.5-kilometer-per-second (about 12,000-mile-per-hour) boost in velocity.

23 January 2000 – flyby of Asteroid 2685 Masursky around 10:00 UTC. &quot;Cassini&quot; took images 5 to 7 hours before at 1.6 million km distance and estimated a diameter of 15 to 20 km.

30 December 2000 10:05 UTC − Gravity-assisted flyby of Jupiter. &quot;Cassini&quot; was at its closest point (9.7 million kilometres, 137 Jovian radii) to Jupiter at this date, and performed many scientific measurements. It also produced the most detailed global color portrait of Jupiter ever produced (seen on the right); the smallest visible features are approximately across.

30 May 2001 – During the coast phase between Jupiter and Saturn, it was noticed that &quot;haze&quot; became visible in the pictures taken by the narrow-angle camera of &quot;Cassini&quot;. This was first seen when a picture of the star Maia in the Pleiades was taken after a routine heating period.

23 July 2002 – In late January, a test was performed to remove the &quot;haze&quot; from the narrow-angle camera lens by heating it. Warming the camera to 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) for eight days produced positive results. Later, the heating was extended to 60 days, and a picture of the star Spica showed an improvement of more than 90 percent compared to before the heating period. On 9 July, a picture showed that the removal procedure was completed successfully, which was announced on 23 July.

10 October 2003 – The &quot;Cassini&quot; science team announced the results of a test of Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravity, using radio signals from the &quot;Cassini&quot; probe. The researchers observed a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the space craft, as those signals traveled close to the Sun. Past tests were in agreement with the theoretical predictions with an accuracy of one part in one thousand. The &quot;Cassini&quot; experiment improved this to about 20 parts in a million, with the data still supporting Einstein&#x27;s theory.

==Primary mission (2004–2008)==
27 February 2004 – A new, high-resolution picture of Saturn taken by &quot;Cassini&quot; on 9 February was released, and it was noted that mission scientists were puzzled by the fact that no &quot;spokes&quot; in Saturn&#x27;s ring are visible. These dark structures in the &quot;B&quot; section of the ring had been discovered in pictures taken by the Voyager probe in 1981. Another picture, in infrared light, taken on 16 February shows cloud height differences and the same disturbance visible throughout the 1990s in Hubble Space Telescope images.

12 March 2004 – Pictures taken on 23 February do show a feature discovered by Voyager: Clumps in the outer &quot;F&quot;-ring. What could not be ascertained at the time was the exact lifetime of these clumps, and it is hoped that &quot;Cassini&quot; will provide conclusive data about this question. The first set of pictures shows a set of &quot;clumps&quot; moving along the &quot;F&quot; ring.

26 March 2004 – The &quot;Cassini&quot; science team published the first sequence of pictures of Saturn showing clouds moving at high speed around the planet. Using a filter to better see water haze on top of the dense cloud cover, motions in the equatorial and southern regions are clearly visible. The pictures were taken during the days from 15 to 19 February.

8 April 2004 – The first &quot;long-term&quot; observation of cloud dynamics in Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere were published by mission scientists. A set of pictures shows two storms in the southern latitudes merge during a period from 19 to 20 March. Both storms had a diameter of about before they merged.

15 April 2004 – NASA announced that two moons discovered by Voyager 1 were sighted again by &quot;Cassini&quot; in pictures taken on 10 March: Prometheus and Pandora. These are no ordinary moons, but their gravitational effects on the &quot;F&quot; ring led scientists to call them &quot;shepherd moons&quot;. They fascinate all researchers interested in the dynamics of the ring system, because their orbits are close enough that they interact with each other in a chaotic manner. They have a history of defying predictions of their orbits. One of &quot;Cassini&#x27;s&quot; missions will be to monitor the movements of these bodies closely.

18 May 2004 – &quot;Cassini&quot; entered the Saturn system. The gravitational pull of Saturn began to overtake the influence of the Sun.

20 May 2004 – The first picture of Titan with better resolution than any Earth-based observation was released. It was taken 5 May from a distance of 29.3 million kilometers (18.2 million miles).

27 May 2004 – TCM-20, the Phoebe approach TCM (Trajectory Correction Maneuver) was executed at 22:26:00 UTC. This was a 5-minute and 56 second burn of the main engine, which was not used since December 1998. It therefore doubled as a &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the 96 minute burn during &quot;Saturn Orbit Insertion&quot; (SOI). However, TCM-20 was mainly designed to change Cassini&#x27;s velocity by 34.7 m/s (78 mph), setting up a flyby of the moon Phoebe 11 June.

11 June 2004 – &quot;Cassini&quot; flew by the moon Phoebe at 19:33 UT in Spacecraft Event Time at 2068 kilometers distance. All of the eleven onboard instruments operated as expected and all data was acquired. Scientists plan to use the data to create global maps of the cratered moon, and to determine Phoebe&#x27;s composition, mass and density. It took scientists several days to pore over the data to make more concrete conclusions.

16 June 2004 – TCM-21 took place with a 38-second main engine burn. It was planned as the last correction of the trajectory of &quot;Cassini&quot; before SOI. A few days later the final TCM-22 tentatively scheduled for 21 June was canceled.

1 July 2004 – The Saturn Orbit Insertion burn was successfully executed. At 7:11 p.m. PDT (10:11 p.m. EDT), &quot;Cassini&quot; crossed the ring plane between Saturn&#x27;s F and G rings. Its antenna was oriented forward acting as a shield against small ring particles. At 7:36 p.m. PDT (10:36 p.m. EDT), the spacecraft began a critical 96-minute main engine burn to cut its velocity by 626 meters per second and permit a 0.02 x 9 million kilometer Saturn orbit. Right after that burn, pictures of the rings were taken and sent back to mission scientist as the spacecraft approached within 19,980 kilometers (12,400 miles) from the cloud tops. Scientists were surprised by the clarity and detail of the pictures and will be poring over them for quite some time. &quot;We won&#x27;t see the whole puzzle, only pieces, but what we are seeing is dramatic,&quot; said Dr. Carolyn Porco, &quot;Cassini&quot; imaging team leader, Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo. &quot;The images are mind-boggling, just mind-boggling. I&#x27;ve been working on this mission for 14 years and I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised, but it is remarkable how startling it is to see these images for the first time.&quot;

2 July 2004 – &quot;Cassini&quot;″s first flyby of Titan was executed and first close up pictures were sent back to Earth. Due to the planning of the initial orbit, &quot;Cassini&quot; was passing over the south pole of the moon and from a larger distance than in later flybys. Regardless, during a press conference on 3 June, mission scientists presented pictures that were already causing them to rethink previous theories. It now seems that the darker and brighter albedo features on the surface do represent different materials. But in contrast to expectation, the icy regions seem to be darker than the areas where other (possibly organic) matter is mixed in with the ice.

16 August 2004 – Mission scientists announce the discovery of two new moons of Saturn, and with it the successful start of one of the programs of &quot;Cassini&quot;: Locating small and yet unknown moons. Later named &quot;Methone&quot; (S/2004 S 1) and &quot;Pallene&quot; (S/2004 S 2), these objects are small compared to other moons and they orbit between Mimas and Enceladus.

23 August 2004 – At a distance of 9 million kilometers from Saturn, the last major firing of the main engine took place to adjust the next closest approach and avoid the particles in the ring system. The 51 minute burn increased the velocity of the probe by 325 meters per second, moving the orbital periapsis point about 300,000 km farther away from Saturn than its smallest distance during SOI. At the same time, the new course will bring &quot;Cassini&quot; very close to Titan on its next flyby.

14 September 2004 – Final checks of the &quot;Huygens&quot; lander were completed successfully.

26 October 2004 – The second flyby of Titan (called &quot;Titan-A&quot;) was successfully executed. Data started to arrive at the JPL mission center at 01:30 UTC, 27 October, and included the highest resolution pictures ever taken of the surface of that moon. Additionally, first high-resolution infra-red spectra and pictures were taken from the atmosphere and surface. The spacecraft successfully skimmed the hazy, smoggy atmosphere of Titan, coming within 1,176 kilometers of Titan&#x27;s surface. The flyby was the closest that any spacecraft has ever come to Titan. The pictures, spectra, and radar data revealed a complex, puzzling surface. The only glitch during the &quot;Titan-A&quot; event involved the CIRS instrument. During playback, the instrument team observed corrupted data. A decision was made to power the instrument off to reboot it. CIRS was powered back on within 24 hours and returned to its nominal state.

23 November 2004 – The last in-flight checks of the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe before separation were completed successfully.

13 December 2004 – The &quot;Titan-B&quot; flyby was executed successfully.

25 December 2004 – &quot;Huygens&quot; probe separated from &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter at 02:00 UTC.

27 December – NASA published a picture of &quot;Huygens&quot; taken from &quot;Cassini&quot; two days after its release. It reported that the analysis of that picture shows that the probe is on the correct course within the expected error range. These checks were necessary in order to place &quot;Cassini&quot; in the correct orientation to receive the data from &quot;Huygens&quot; when it entered Titan&#x27;s atmosphere.

28 December 2004 – OTM-10 was executed at 03:00 UTC in Spacecraft Event Time. This maneuver, also called the Orbit Deflection Maneuver (ODM), took &quot;Cassini&quot; off of a Titan-impacting trajectory and on to a flyby trajectory with the required altitude to receive data from the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe as it plunged into Titan&#x27;s thick atmosphere.

31 December 2004 – &quot;Cassini&quot;″s flyby of Iapetus occurred at 18:45:37 UTC at an altitude of 122645 kilometers. First raw pictures were available the next day.

14 January 2005 – &quot;Huygens&quot; entered Titan&#x27;s atmosphere at 09:06 UTC and landed softly on its surface about two hours later. This was confirmed by the reception of the carrier wave emitted by the probe during its descent and touchdown. At 16:19 UTC, the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter started to relay the scientific data received from the probe to Earth. The first picture was released at 19:45 UTC, showing a view from about 16 km above the surface. A second picture taken from the probe at rest on the surface was released a short time later.

15 February 2005 – &quot;Cassini&quot; executed a successful Titan flyby, with new regions of its surface scanned by radar. &quot;Cassini&quot;″s mapping radar acquired a picture that shows a large crater on Titan, with an estimated diameter of .

17 February 2005 – The first close flyby of Enceladus was executed and the first closeup images were sent back to Earth. The flyby distance was about .

17 March 2005 – The &quot;Cassini&quot; probe revealed that Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus has an atmosphere. It has been described as &quot;substantial&quot; by its discoverers.

16 April 2005 – The fifth planned flyby of Titan with a minimum distance of about 1,025 kilometers was executed at 19:12 UTC. This was the closest flyby up to this date, and provided the opportunity to obtain more detailed data on the constituents in the upper atmosphere of Titan. The first analysis of that data showed a large range of complex carbon molecules. On 25 April a mass plot was published that demonstrates the existence of these molecules.

3 May 2005 – &quot;Cassini&quot; begins Radio occultation experiments on Saturn&#x27;s Rings, to determine ring particle size distribution, on the scale of centimeters.

10 May 2005 – At the beginning of a period of focussed observation of the ring system of Saturn, slated to take until September, mission scientists announced the discovery of a new moon in the &quot;Keeler gap&quot; inside the &quot;A&quot; ring. Provisionally named S/2005 S 1 and later named Daphnis, it was first seen in a time-lapse sequence of images taken on 1 May. Imaging scientists had predicted the new moon&#x27;s presence and its orbital distance from Saturn after last July&#x27;s sighting of a set of peculiar spiky and wispy features in the Keeler gap&#x27;s outer edge.

14 July 2005 – The closest flyby of Enceladus with a distance of was executed successfully. First raw pictures were published.

7 September 2005 – Flyby of Titan at a distance of , data gathered partially lost due to software problem.

26 September 2005 – Flyby of Hyperion at a distance of , the closest flyby and only visit to the moon during the primary mission.

27 July 2006 – NASA confirms the presence of hydrocarbon lakes in Titan&#x27;s northern polar region.

28 May 2008 – &quot;Cassini&quot; completed its 43rd flyby of Titan, ending its primary mission. Renamed &quot;Cassini&quot; Equinox mission, &quot;Cassini&quot; observed Saturn during its equinox crossing, or summertime.

==&quot;Cassini&quot; Equinox mission (2008–2010)==
9 August, 11 August, 9 October, and 31 October 2008 – With closest approach at 50, 25, and 200 km, respectively, &quot;Cassini&quot;″s last three Enceladus flybys of 2008 utilized a new imaging technique named &quot;skeet shooting&quot; to successfully acquire very high resolution images. The flybys also allowed &quot;Cassini&quot; to directly sample Enceladus&#x27;s cryovolcanic plumes.

3 November, 14 November, 5 December, and 21 December 2009 – Titan flybys 46 through 49 concentrated on radar, VIMS, and INMS sampling of Titan and its thick atmosphere. T47 involved high-resolution VIMS coverage of the Huygens landing site, while the other three flybys made use of radar and RSS. T49 allowed radar coverage of Ontario Lacus, one of the largest methane lakes on Titan.

June - October 2009 – &quot;Cassini&quot; observed Saturn during its equinox, or the time of Saturn&#x27;s year where the sun is directly over its equator.

2 November 2010 – &quot;Cassini&quot; was triggered into a protective standby mode, or &quot;safe mode&quot;, after a bit flip caused it to miss an important instruction. NASA announced the interruption in scientific processes on 8 November. However, by 8 November some of the craft&#x27;s functionality had already been partly restored. Nominal scientific instrument sequencing events were successfully started on 10 November. &quot;Cassini&quot; was reactivated as scheduled on 24 November and has returned to perfect working order, in time for two scheduled close fly-bys with Enceladus. At this point there has been no public disclosure as to the data loss impact of the 11 November (T-73) flyby. However, no images were acquired on the 11 November polar flyby.
==&quot;Cassini&quot; Solstice Mission (2010–2017)==
On 3 February 2010, NASA announced that a second mission extension until May 2017, a few months past Saturn&#x27;s summer solstice, had been funded. The schedule included an additional 155 orbits, with 54 flybys of Titan, 11 of Enceladus, 2 of Rhea, and 3 of Dione. One of the flybys of Titan dipped below the ionosphere.

==Grand Finale (2017)==
On 15 September 2017, &quot;Cassini&quot; was deliberately disposed of by a controlled fall into Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere, ending its nearly two-decade-long mission. The last signal was received at 11:55:46 UTC.

<text>Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga (25 August 1528 – 5 March 1576) was a Spanish general, sailor, diplomat and politician. He served as governor of the Duchy of Milan (1572–1573) and as governor of the Spanish Netherlands (1573–1576).

==Biography==
Luis de Requesens y Zúñiga was born at Molins de Rei, Spanish Empire. He, and his brother Juan de Zúñiga y Requesens (Viceroy of Naples in 1579–1582), were the sons of Juan de Zúñiga, a tutor of King Philip II, and Estefanía de Requesens. He married Gerónima Esterlich y Gralla, the daughter of Francisco Gralla, &quot;Maestre Racional&quot; or Finances Head Controller in Catalonia.

His early career was that of a government official and diplomat. In 1563 he gained the king&#x27;s confidence as his representative at Rome. In 1568 he was appointed lieutenant-general to John of Austria during the suppression of the Morisco Revolt in the Alpujarras, and he also accompanied John during the Lepanto campaign, his function being to watch and control his nominal commander-in-chief, whose excitable temperament was distrusted by the king.

In 1572 Philip named him Governor of the Duchy of Milan, a post usually given to a great noble. Requesens was only a gentleman, though by the king&#x27;s favour he was grand commander of the military order of Santiago in Castile. He was credited with having shown moderation at Milan, but he came into sharp collision with the archbishop, Charles Borromeo, who took up the cause of his flock.

In 1573 he was called by Philip II to succeed the Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba as governor of the Spanish Netherlands, then in revolt against the Spaniards.

He was rather moderate in comparison to Alba, requesting Philip to grant a general amnesty to all, with the exception of persistent heretics, and to permit the emigration of those who would not comply.

The king wished to pursue a more conciliatory policy, without, however, yielding any one of the points in dispute between himself and the revolting Dutch. His situation was aggravated by the empty Spanish treasury. Requesens came to Brussels on 17 November 1573 and launched a new military campaign. In February 1574 the rebels had conquered the port of Middelburg, but Requesens&#x27;s army obtained a victory against the troops of Louis of Nassau at the Battle of Mookerheyde, during which William the Silent&#x27;s two brothers died.

However, at this point the money for funding his troops was exhausted; Requesens had to find an agreement with William the Silent, the leader of the Flemish opposition, with the mediation of the Emperor Maximilian II. The negotiations were held in Breda. Requesens declared himself ready to remove his troops from Flanders, but in exchange Catholicism was to be the only religion accepted. However, by now Protestantism had gained deep roots in the Netherlands, and therefore the proposal was rebuffed by the Dutch. Requesens restarted the military campaign and his troops occupied much of Zeeland, but when Philip II stopped payment to the Flemish troops, they mutinied and military operations were halted for one year.

Requesens died suddenly at Brussels in 1576, to be replaced in the now totally chaotic Netherlands by John of Austria, half-brother of King Philip II of Spain. His body was brought to Barcelona and buried in his family palace.

<text>Argenis is a book by John Barclay. It is a work of historical allegory which tells the story of the religious conflict in France under Henry III of France and Henry IV of France, and also touches on more contemporary English events, such as the Overbury scandal. The tendency is royalist, anti-aristocratic; it is told from the angle of a king who reduces the landed aristocrats&#x27; power in the interest of the &quot;country&quot;, the interest of which is identified with that of the king.

Jennifer Morrish describes &quot;Argenis&quot; as one of &quot;the two most influential Neo-Latin novels&quot;, along with Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot;.

<text>In organometallic chemistry, organolithium reagents are chemical compounds that contain carbon–lithium (C–Li) bonds. These reagents are important in organic synthesis, and are frequently used to transfer the organic group or the lithium atom to the substrates in synthetic steps, through nucleophilic addition or simple deprotonation. Organolithium reagents are used in industry as an initiator for anionic polymerization, which leads to the production of various elastomers. They have also been applied in asymmetric synthesis in the pharmaceutical industry. Due to the large difference in electronegativity between the carbon atom and the lithium atom, the C−Li bond is highly ionic. Owing to the polar nature of the C−Li bond, organolithium reagents are good nucleophiles and strong bases. For laboratory organic synthesis, many organolithium reagents are commercially available in solution form. These reagents are highly reactive, and are sometimes pyrophoric. 
==History and development==
Studies of organolithium reagents began in the 1930s and were pioneered by Karl Ziegler, Georg Wittig, and Henry Gilman. In comparison with Grignard (magnesium) reagents, organolithium reagents can often perform the same reactions with increased rates and higher yields, such as in the case of metalation.
Since then, organolithium reagents have overtaken Grignard reagents in common usage.

== Structure ==
Although simple alkyllithium species are often represented as monomer RLi, they exist as aggregates (oligomers) or polymers. 
The degree of aggregation depends on the organic substituent and the presence of other ligands. These structures have been elucidated by a variety of methods, notably 6Li, 7Li, and 13C NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Computational chemistry supports these assignments.

=== Nature of carbon–lithium bond ===
The relative electronegativities of carbon and lithium suggest that the C−Li bond will be highly polar.
However, certain organolithium compounds possess properties such as solubility in nonpolar solvents that complicate the issue.
 While most data suggest the C−Li bond to be essentially ionic, there has been debate as to how much covalent character exists in it. One estimate puts the percentage of ionic character of alkyllithium compounds at 80 to 88%.

In allyl lithium compounds, the lithium cation coordinates to the face of the carbon π bond in an η3 fashion instead of a localized, carbanionic center, thus, allyllithiums are often less aggregated than alkyllithiums. In aryllithium complexes, the lithium cation coordinates to a single carbanion center through a Li−C σ type bond.
===Solid state structure===
Like other species consisting of polar subunits, organolithium species aggregate.
Formation of aggregates is influenced by electrostatic interactions, the coordination between lithium and surrounding solvent molecules or polar additives, and steric effects.

A basic building block toward constructing more complex structures is a carbanionic center interacting with a Li3 triangle in an η3- fashion.
In simple alkyllithium reagents, these triangles aggregate to form tetrahedron or octahedron structures. For example, methyllithium, ethyllithium and &quot;tert&quot;-butyllithium all exist in the tetramer [RLi]4. Methyllithium exists as tetramers in a cubane-type cluster in the solid state, with four lithium centers forming a tetrahedron. Each methanide in the tetramer in methyllithium can have agostic interaction with lithium cations in adjacent tetramers.
Ethyllithium and &quot;tert&quot;-butyllithium, on the other hand, do not exhibit this interaction, and are thus soluble in non-polar hydrocarbon solvents. Another class of alkyllithium adopts hexameric structures, such as &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium, isopropyllithium, and cyclohexanyllithium.

Common lithium amides, e.g. lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide and lithium diisopropylamide, are also subject to aggregation. Lithium amides adopt polymeric-ladder type structures in non-coordinating solvent in the solid state, and they generally exist as dimers in ethereal solvents. In the presence of strongly donating ligands, tri- or tetrameric lithium centers are formed. 

For example, LDA exists primarily as dimers in THF. The structures of common lithium amides, such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) have been extensively studied by Collum and coworkers using NMR spectroscopy.
Another important class of reagents is silyllithiums, extensively used in the synthesis of organometallic complexes and polysilane dendrimers.
In the solid state, in contrast with alkyllithium reagents, most silyllithiums tend to form monomeric structures coordinated with solvent molecules such as THF, and only a few silyllithiums have been characterized as higher aggregates.
This difference can arise from the method of preparation of silyllithiums, the steric hindrance caused by the bulky alkyl substituents on silicon, and the less polarized nature of Si−Li bonds. The addition of strongly donating ligands, such as TMEDA and (-)-sparteine, can displace coordinating solvent molecules in silyllithiums.

===Solution structure===
It is possible for organolithium reagents adopt structures in solution that differ from the solid state. NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for the studies of organolithium aggregates in solution. For alkyllithium species, C−Li &quot;J&quot; coupling can often used to determine the number of lithium interacting with a carbanion center, and whether these interactions are static or dynamic. Separate NMR signals can also differentiate the presence of multiple aggregates from a common monomeric unit.

Organolithium compounds bind Lewis bases such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et2O), tetramethylethylene diamine (TMEDA) or hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). Methyllithium is a special case: its tetrameric structure is unaffected by ether or even HMPA. On the other hand, THF deaggregates hexameric butyl lithium: the tetramer is the main species, and ΔG for interconversion between tetramer and dimer is around 11 kcal/mol. TMEDA can also chelate to the lithium cations in &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium and form solvated dimers such as [(TMEDA) LiBu-n)]2. Phenyllithium has been shown to exist as a distorted tetramer in the crystallized ether solvate, and as a mixture of dimer and tetramer in ether solution.

===Structure and reactivity===
As the structures of organolithium reagents change according to their chemical environment, so do their reactivity and selectivity.
One question surrounding the structure-reactivity relationship is whether there exists a correlation between the degree of aggregation and the reactivity of organolithium reagents. It was originally proposed that lower aggregates such as monomers are more reactive in alkyllithiums. 
However, reaction pathways in which dimer or other oligomers are the reactive species have also been discovered, and for lithium amides such as LDA, dimer-based reactions are common. 
A series of solution kinetics studies of LDA-mediated reactions suggest that lower aggregates of enolates do not necessarily lead to higher reactivity.

Also, some Lewis bases increase reactivity of organolithium compounds.

However, whether these additives function as strong chelating ligands, and how the observed increase in reactivity relates to structural changes in aggregates caused by these additives are not always clear.
For example, TMEDA increases rates and efficiencies in many reactions involving organolithium reagents. Toward alkyllithium reagents, TMEDA functions as a donor ligand, reduces the degree of aggregation, and increases the nucleophilicity of these species.
However, TMEDA does not always function as a donor ligand to lithium cation, especially in the presence of anionic oxygen and nitrogen centers. For example, it only weakly interacts with LDA and LiHMDS even in hydrocarbon solvents with no competing donor ligands.
In imine lithiation, while THF acts as a strong donating ligand to LiHMDS, the weakly coordinating TMEDA readily dissociates from LiHMDS, leading to the formation of LiHMDS dimers that is the more reactive species. Thus, in the case of LiHMDS, TMEDA does not increase reactivity by reducing aggregation state. Also, as opposed to simple alkyllithium compounds, TMEDA does not deaggregate lithio-acetophenolate in THF solution.
The addition of HMPA to lithium amides such as LiHMDS and LDA often results in a mixture of dimer/monomer aggregates in THF. However, the ratio of dimer/monomer species does not change with increased concentration of HMPA, thus, the observed increase in reactivity is not the result of deaggregation. The mechanism of how these additives increase reactivity is still being researched.

== Reactivity and applications==
The C−Li bond in organolithium reagents is highly polarized. As a result, the carbon attracts most of the electron density in the bond and resembles a carbanion. Thus, organolithium reagents are strongly basic and nucleophilic. Some of the most common applications of organolithium reagents in synthesis include their use as nucleophiles, strong bases for deprotonation, initiator for polymerization, and starting material for the preparation of other organometallic compounds.

===As nucleophile===

====Carbolithiation reactions====
As nucleophiles, organolithium reagents undergo carbolithiation reactions, whereby the carbon-lithium bond adds across a carbon&quot;–&quot;carbon double or triple bond, forming new organolithium species. This reaction is the most widely employed reaction of organolithium compounds. Carbolithiation is key in anionic polymerization processes, and &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium is used as a catalyst to initiate the polymerization of styrene, butadiene, or isoprene or mixtures thereof.

Another application that takes advantage of this reactivity is the formation of carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds by intramolecular carbolithiation. As a form of anionic cyclization, intramolecular carbolithiation reactions offer several advantages over radical cyclization. First, it is possible for the product cyclic organolithium species to react with electrophiles, whereas it is often difficult to trap a radical intermediate of the corresponding structure. Secondly, anionic cyclizations are often more regio- and stereospecific than radical cyclization, particularly in the case of 5-hexenyllithiums. Intramolecular carbolithiation allows addition of the alkyl-, vinyllithium to triple bonds and mono-alkyl substituted double bonds. Aryllithiums can also undergo addition if a 5-membered ring is formed. The limitations of intramolecular carbolithiation include difficulty of forming 3 or 4-membered rings, as the intermediate cyclic organolithium species often tend to undergo ring-openings. Below is an example of intramolecular carbolithiation reaction. The lithium species derived from the lithium–halogen exchange cyclized to form the vinyllithium through 5-exo-trig ring closure. The vinyllithium species further reacts with electrophiles and produce functionalized cyclopentylidene compounds.

====Addition to carbonyl compounds====
Nucleophilic organolithium reagents can add to electrophilic carbonyl double bonds to form carbon&quot;–&quot;carbon bonds. They can react with aldehydes and ketones to produce alcohols. The addition proceeds mainly via polar addition, in which the nucleophilic organolithium species attacks from the equatorial direction, and produces the axial alcohol. Addition of lithium salts such as LiClO4 can improve the stereoselectivity of the reaction.

When the ketone is sterically hindered, using Grignard reagents often leads to reduction of the carbonyl group instead of addition. However, alkyllithium reagents are less likely to reduce the ketone, and may be used to synthesize substituted alcohols. Below is an example of ethyllithium addition to adamantone to produce tertiary alcohol.

Organolithium reagents are also better than Grignard reagents in their ability to react with carboxylic acids to form ketones. This reaction can be optimized by carefully controlling the amount of organolithium reagent addition, or using trimethylsilyl chloride to quench excess lithium reagent. A more common way to synthesize ketones is through the addition of organolithium reagents to Weinreb amides (&quot;N&quot;-methoxy-&quot;N&quot;-methyl amides). This reaction provides ketones when the organolithium reagents is used in excess, due to chelation of the lithium ion between the &quot;N&quot;-methoxy oxygen and the carbonyl oxygen, which forms a tetrahedral intermediate that collapses upon acidic work up.

Organolithium reagents also react with carbon dioxide to form, after workup, carboxylic acids.

In the case of enone substrates, where two sites of nucleophilic addition are possible (1,2 addition to the carbonyl carbon or 1,4 conjugate addition to the β carbon), most highly reactive organolithium species favor the 1,2 addition, however, there are several ways to propel organolithium reagents to undergo conjugate addition. First, since the 1,4 adduct is the likely to be the more thermodynamically favorable species, conjugate addition can be achieved through equilibration (isomerization of the two product), especially when the lithium nucleophile is weak and 1,2 addition is reversible. Secondly, adding donor ligands to the reaction forms heteroatom-stabilized lithium species which favors 1,4 conjugate addition. In one example, addition of low-level of HMPA to the solvent favors the 1,4 addition. In the absence of donor ligand, lithium cation is closely coordinated to the oxygen atom, however, when the lithium cation is solvated by HMPA, the coordination between carbonyl oxygen and lithium ion is weakened. This method generally cannot be used to affect the regioselectivity of alkyl- and aryllithium reagents.

Organolithium reagents can also perform enantioselective nucleophilic addition to carbonyl and its derivatives, often in the presence of chiral ligands. This reactivity is widely applied in the industrial syntheses of pharmaceutical compounds. An example is the Merck and Dupont synthesis of Efavirenz, a potent HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Lithium acetylide is added to a prochiral ketone to yield a chiral alcohol product. The structure of the active reaction intermediate was determined by NMR spectroscopy studies in the solution state and X-ray crystallography of the solid state to be a cubic 2:2 tetramer.

====SN2 type reactions====
Organolithium reagents can serve as nucleophiles and carry out SN2 type reactions with alkyl or allylic halides.
Although they are considered more reactive than Grignard reagents in alkylation, their use is still limited due to competing side reactions such as radical reactions or metal&quot;–&quot;halogen exchange. Most organolithium reagents used in alkylations are more stabilized, less basic, and less aggregated, such as heteroatom stabilized, aryl- or allyllithium reagents. HMPA has been shown to increase reaction rate and product yields, and the reactivity of aryllithium reagents is often enhanced by the addition of potassium alkoxides. Organolithium reagents can also carry out nucleophilic attacks with epoxides to form alcohols.

===As base===
Organolithium reagents provide a wide range of basicity. &quot;tert&quot;-Butyllithium, with three weakly electron donating alkyl groups, is the strongest base commercially available (pKa = 53). As a result, the acidic protons on −OH, −NH and −SH are often protected in the presence of organolithium reagents. Some commonly used lithium bases are alkyllithium species such as &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium and lithium dialkylamides (LiNR2). Reagents with bulky R groups such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) and lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) are often sterically hindered for nucleophilic addition, and are thus more selective toward deprotonation. Lithium dialkylamides (LiNR2) are widely used in enolate formation and aldol reaction. The reactivity and selectivity of these bases are also influenced by solvents and other counter ions.

====Metalation====
Metalation with organolithium reagents, also known as lithiation or lithium-hydrogen exchange, is achieved when an organolithium reagent, most commonly an alkyllithium, abstracts a proton and forms a new organolithium species. 
Common metalation reagents are the butyllithiums. &quot;tert&quot;-Butyllithium and &quot;sec&quot;-butyllithium are generally more reactive and have better selectivity than &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium, however, they are also more expensive and difficult to handle. Metalation is a common way of preparing versatile organolithium reagents. The position of metalation is mostly controlled by the acidity of the C-H bond. Lithiation often occurs at a position α to electron withdrawing groups, since they are good at stabilizing the electron-density of the anion. Directing groups on aromatic compounds and heterocycles provide regioselective sites of metalation; directed ortho metalation is an important class of metalation reactions. Metalated sulfones, acyl groups and α-metalated amides are important intermediates in chemistry synthesis. Metalation of allyl ether with alkyllithium or LDA forms an anion α to the oxygen, and can proceed to 2,3-Wittig rearrangement. Addition of donor ligands such as TMEDA and HMPA can increase metalation rate and broaden substrate scope. Chiral organolithium reagents can be accessed through asymmetric metalation.

Directed ortho metalation is an important tool in the synthesis of regiospecific substituted aromatic compounds. This approach to lithiation and subsequent quenching of the intermediate lithium species with electrophile is often better than the electrophilic aromatic substitution due to its high regioselectivity. This reaction proceeds through deprotonation by organolithium reagents at the positions α to the direct metalation group (DMG) on the aromatic ring. The DMG is often a functional group containing a heteroatom that is Lewis basic, and can coordinate to the Lewis-acidic lithium cation. This generates a complex-induced proximity effect, which directs deprotonation at the α position to form an aryllithium species that can further react with electrophiles. Some of the most effective DMGs are amides, carbamates, sulfones and sulfonamides. They are strong electron-withdrawing groups that increase the acidity of alpha-protons on the aromatic ring. In the presence of two DMGs, metalation often occurs ortho to the stronger directing group, though mixed products are also observed. A number of heterocycles that contain acidic protons can also undergo ortho-metalation. However, for electron-poor heterocycles, lithium amide bases such as LDA are generally used, since alkyllithium has been observed to perform addition to the electron-poor heterocycles rather than deprotonation. In certain transition metal-arene complexes, such as ferrocene, the transition metal attracts electron-density from the arene, thus rendering the aromatic protons more acidic, and ready for ortho-metalation.

====Superbases====

Addition of potassium alkoxide to alkyllithium greatly increases the basicity of organolithium species. The most common &quot;superbase&quot; can be formed by addition of KOtBu to butyllithium, often abbreviated as &quot;LiCKOR&quot; reagents. These &quot;superbases&quot; are highly reactive and often stereoselective reagents. In the example below, the LiCKOR base generates a stereospecific crotylboronate species through metalation and subsequent lithium-metalloid exchange.

=====Asymmetric metalation=====
Enantioenriched organolithium species can be obtained through asymmetric metalation of prochiral substrates. Asymmetric induction requires the presence of a chiral ligand such as (-)-sparteine. The enantiomeric ratio of the chiral lithium species is often influenced by the differences in rates of deprotonation. In the example below, treatment of &quot;N&quot;-Boc-&quot;N&quot;-benzylamine with &quot;n&quot;-butyllithium in the presence of (-)-sparteine affords one enantiomer of the product with high enantiomeric excess. Transmetalation with trimethyltinchloride affords the opposite enantiomer.

====Enolate formation====

Lithium enolates are formed through deprotonation of a C−H bond α to the carbonyl group by an organolithium species. Lithium enolates are widely used as nucleophiles in carbon&quot;–&quot;carbon bond formation reactions such as aldol condensation and alkylation. They are also an important intermediate in the formation of silyl enol ether.

Lithium enolate formation can be generalized as an acid&quot;–&quot;base reaction, in which the relatively acidic proton α to the carbonyl group (pK =20-28 in DMSO) reacts with organolithium base. Generally, strong, non-nucleophilic bases, especially lithium amides such LDA, LiHMDS and LiTMP are used. THF and DMSO are common solvents in lithium enolate reactions.

The stereochemistry and mechanism of enolate formation have gained much interest in the chemistry community. Many factors influence the outcome of enolate stereochemistry, such as steric effects, solvent, polar additives, and types of organolithium bases. Among the many models used to explain and predict the selectivity in stereochemistry of lithium enolates is the Ireland model.

In this assumption, a monomeric LDA reacts with the carbonyl substrate and form a cyclic Zimmerman–Traxler type transition state. The (E)-enolate is favored due to an unfavorable &quot;syn-pentane&quot; interaction in the (Z)-enolate transition state.

Addition of polar additives such as HMPA or DMPU favors the formation of (Z) enolates. The Ireland model argues that these donor ligands coordinate to the lithium cations, as a result, carbonyl oxygen and lithium interaction is reduced, and the transition state is not as tightly bound as a six-membered chair. The percentage of (Z) enolates also increases when lithium bases with bulkier side chains (such as LiHMDS) are used. However, the mechanism of how these additives reverse stereoselectivity is still being debated.

There have been some challenges to the Ireland model, as it depicts the lithium species as a monomer in the transition state. In reality, a variety of lithium aggregates are often observed in solutions of lithium enolates, and depending on specific substrate, solvent and reaction conditions, it can be difficult to determine which aggregate is the actual reactive species in solution.

=== Lithium–halogen exchange ===
Lithium–halogen exchange involves heteroatom exchange between an organohalide and organolithium species.

Lithium–halogen exchange is very useful in preparing new organolithium reagents. The application of lithium–halogen exchange is illustrated by the Parham cyclization.

===Transmetalation===
Organolithium reagents are often used to prepare other organometallic compounds by transmetalation. Organocopper, organotin, organosilicon, organoboron, organophosphorus, organocerium and organosulfur compounds are frequently prepared by reacting organolithium reagents with appropriate electrophiles.

Common types of transmetalation include Li/Sn, Li/Hg, and Li/Te exchange, which are fast at low temperature. The advantage of Li/Sn exchange is that the tri-alkylstannane precursors undergo few side reactions, as the resulting n-Bu3Sn byproducts are unreactive toward alkyllithium reagents. In the following example, vinylstannane, obtained by hydrostannylation of a terminal alkyne, forms vinyllithium through transmetalation with n-BuLi.

Organolithium can also be used in to prepare organozinc compounds through transmetalation with zinc salts.

Lithium diorganocuprates can be formed by reacting alkyl lithium species with copper(I) halide. The resulting organocuprates are generally less reactive toward aldehydes and ketones than organolithium reagents or Grignard reagents.

== Preparation ==
Most simple alkyllithium reagents, and common lithium amides are commercially available in a variety of solvents and concentrations. Organolithium reagents can also be prepared in the laboratory. Below are some common methods for preparing organolithium reagents.

===Displacement of a leaving group===
In lithium-halogen exchange, reduction of alkyl halide with metallic lithium can afford simple alkyl and aryl organolithium reagents.
&quot;tert-&quot;Butyllithium or &quot;n-&quot;butyllithium are the most commonly used reagents for generating new organolithium species through lithium halogen exchange. Lithium–halogen exchange is mostly used to convert aryl and alkenyl iodides and bromides with &quot;sp2&quot; carbons to the corresponding organolithium compounds. The reaction is extremely fast, and often proceed at −60 to −120 °C.

Industrial preparation of organolithium reagents is achieved using this method by treating the alkyl chloride with metal lithium containing 0.5&quot;–&quot;2% sodium. The conversion is highly exothermic. The sodium initiates the radical pathway and increases the rate. The reduction proceeds via a radical pathway. Below is an example of the preparation of a functionalized lithium reagent using reduction with lithium metal. Sometimes, lithium metal in the form of fine powders are used in the reaction with certain catalysts such as naphthalene or 4,4’-di-t-butylbiphenyl (DTBB). Another substrate that can be reduced with lithium metal to generate alkyllithium reagents is sulfides. Reduction of sulfides is useful in the formation of functionalized organolithium reagents such as alpha-lithio ethers, sulfides, and silanes.

===Metalation===

A second method of preparing organolithium reagents is a metalation (lithium hydrogen exchange). The relative acidity of hydrogen atoms controls the position of lithiation.

This is the most common method for preparing alkynyllithium reagents, because the terminal hydrogen bound to the &quot;sp&quot; carbon is very acidic and easily deprotonated. For aromatic compounds, the position of lithiation is also determined by the directing effect of substituent groups. Some of the most effective directing substituent groups are alkoxy, amido, sulfoxide, sulfonyl. Metalation often occurs at the position ortho to these substituents. In heteroaromatic compounds, metalation usually occurs at the position ortho to the heteroatom.

===Transmetalation===

The fourth method to prepare organolithium reagents is through transmetalation. This method can be used for preparing vinyllithium.

===Shapiro reaction===
In the Shapiro reaction, two equivalents of strong alkyllithium base react with p-tosylhydrazone compounds to produce the vinyllithium, or upon quenching, the olefin product.

==Handling==
Organolithium compounds are highly reactive species and require specialized handling techniques. They are often corrosive, flammable, and sometimes pyrophoric (spontaneous ignition when exposed to air or moisture). Alkyllithium reagents can also undergo thermal decomposition to form the corresponding alkyl species and lithium hydride. Organolithium reagents are typically stored below 10 °C. Reactions are conducted using air-free techniques. The concentration of alkyllithium reagents is often determined by titration.

Organolithium reagents react, often slowly, with ethers, which nonetheless are often used as solvents.

<text>Catholic Youth Organization (CYO) is an international Catholic youth movement founded by Bishop Bernard Sheil in Chicago in 1930. It became a major factor in the development of race relations in the US Catholic Church following World War II. 

== History ==
The first CYO was initiated by prison chaplain and auxiliary bishop Bernard J. Sheil in Chicago in 1930 during the Great Depression. The first CYO was conceptualized as an athletic association. Its aim was to offer young males, especially from the working class, a community and constructive leisure activity in the hope to dissuade them from taking part in criminal activities. 

The first CYOs adopted structures similar to the older Protestant youth movement, the YMCA. However, unlike the YMCA, the CYO used Catholic social teachings and New Deal ideology. Furthermore, under the patronage of archbishop George Cardinal Mundelein, it became a core principle of CYO not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or gender—as was common in other youth organizations of the time.

CYOs operate around the world in the 21st century.

== Aims ==
The organization&#x27;s main purposes are guiding the young Catholics to live a Christian life from a young age, developing trust between peers, and living a happy life in a positive manner.

== Activities ==
Usually each group uses the church for meeting and gathering, although some have their own premises. Activities vary in accordance with local culture but often includes prayer, singing, charity, sales, sports and visiting the sick. In the United States, CYO is mainly known for its organized sports programs, notably boxing, basketball, baseball, track and field, and volleyball, as well as drum corps. Its athletic contests are often so competitive that CYO has been jokingly described as &quot;Crush Your Opponents.&quot;

<text>The Beretta 92G-SD and 96G-SD Special Duty handguns are semi-automatic, locked-breech delayed recoil-operated, double/single-action pistols, fitted with the heavy, wide Brigadier slide, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge (92G-SD) and the .40 S&amp;W cartridge (96G-SD), framed with the addition of the tactical equipment rail, designed and manufactured by Beretta.

== History ==
First appearing in 2001, the Beretta 92G-SD and 96G-SD models evolved from the 92G version which was designed specifically for the French &quot;Gendarmerie Nationale&quot; (French military designation of &quot;PAMAS-G1&quot; which was initially manufactured in Italy by Beretta with steel supplied by France, and subsequently manufactured under license from Beretta in France by GIAT; 1987–present) and used also by the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force) and other law enforcement agencies. The 96G is the authorized service pistol of the Florida Highway Patrol. Production of the 92G-SD and 96G-SD ceased in 2005.
Beretta resumed manufacturing of the 92G-SD in 2015.

== Operation ==
Upon discharge, the pressures created by the expanding gases actuates the slide-barrel assembly in the following manner: after traveling rearward a small distance, the locking block stops the rearward movement of the barrel and releases the slide, which continues its rearward movement. The slide then extracts and ejects the spent cartridge case while compressing the recoil spring (positioned horizontally, directly below the barrel between the parallel guides of the receiver), and simultaneously cocks the hammer. The magazine spring forces the next cartridge up into line. At the apex of the recoil stroke the recoil spring acts to reverse the direction of the slide, chambering a fresh cartridge.

== Specifications ==
Similar to a Beretta 92FS Brigadier and fitted with its heavy, wide slide that had removable front and rear night sights. Because of the heavier slide, the gun&#x27;s balance was enhanced and felt recoil was reduced, improving accuracy for follow-up shots.

The trigger spring had bends on both ends, so if it broke in the field, it could be taken out and installed &quot;backwards&quot;. It acted as its own spare spring.

The 92G-SD &amp; 96G-SD were fitted only with a decocking device (no safety), which, when pressed down, disconnected the trigger, rotated the firing pin away, allowing the hammer to drop without causing an accidental discharge. When released, the decocker levers return to their normal firing position. The pistol was ready to fire at all times. Initially, the Beretta &quot;G&quot; configured guns were sold only to government law enforcement and military agencies.

The 92G-SD &amp; 96G-SD used a frame based on the standard Beretta 92FS frame with the addition of the tactical equipment Weaver rail mount.

Ambidextrous Manual Decocking Lever. Accessible by the thumb of a right- or left-handed shooter, it was spring-loaded. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin.

Night sights. Removable Trijicon 3-dot pressurized tritium gas, self-luminous iron sights for low-light-condition sighting.

Automatic Firing Pin Block. The front part of the firing pin was blocked from any forward movement until the trigger was pulled completely back. Even if the pistol fell and struck the ground, muzzle-down, the firing pin would not strike the primer.

Checkered Grip. The front and back grip straps were machine checkered (25 per inch), whereas the 92FS was vertically serrated. The grip frame was flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control.

Extended/Reversible Magazine Release Button. Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right- or left-handed shooters. Allowed rapid reloading. Magazine dropped clear when released.

Double and Single Action. This pistol model fired double-action on the first round and single-action on the subsequent rounds. Squeezing the trigger would cock and trip the hammer, firing the pistol. After the initial shot the pistol would continually fire in single-action. The longer, heavier trigger pull of the double action made inadvertent discharge less likely, while the lighter, shorter single-action trigger pull allowed faster, more precise discharge of subsequent rounds.

The ejector of the 92G-SD had an angle cut into it to eject the empty brass to the right side of the gun. The engineering of the 96G-SD would not allow this design of the ejector, so occasionally a brass would be ejected in a back direction.

Loaded-chamber indicator. The chamber-loaded indicator was visible or could be felt by touch.

Disassembly Latch. Located to simplify field stripping and maintenance, the latch made this model easy and quick to disassemble.

Finish. The exterior finish was called Bruniton, which is a Beretta corrosion resistant non-glare matte finish.

Open Slide Design. The primary role of the open-top slide was to provide a 180° ejection port. Open top slide virtually eliminated jamming or stovepiping. The slide retention device, which caused the slide and barrel assembly to remain open after the last cartridge had been fired and ejected, allowed the user to load the chamber one cartridge at a time (emergency tactical loading) should the magazine be lost or damaged. The pistols were designed so that the extractor would not be damaged by direct chamber loading. These models operated on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yielded a faster cycle time.

Plastic parts. Guide Rod, Hammer Spring Cap (w or w/o lanyard), Trigger, Hammer (metal internals), Magazine Release, Take Down Lever, Mag Base.

== Intended market ==
Per Beretta USA, the Beretta 92G-SD was designed for United States Army Special Forces that required a high quality special duty pistol that could be fitted with a tactical light or laser, but also found a market in the home protection area.

== Design advantages ==
The Beretta 92G-SD and 96G-SD with the slide mounted decocking lever is quick into action. The added advantages of night sights and an equipment rail made it an attractive home protection/law enforcement pistol. The barrel was made of stainless steel to protect it from wear and corrosion.

<text>A roadster (also spider, spyder) is an open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character. Initially an American term for a two-seat car with no weather protection, its usage has spread internationally and has evolved to include two-seat convertibles.

The roadster was also a style of racing car driven in United States Auto Club (USAC) Championship Racing, including the Indianapolis 500, in the 1950s and 1960s. This type of racing car was superseded by rear-mid-engine cars.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;roadster&quot; originates in the United States, where it was used in the 19th century to describe a horse suitable for travelling. By the end of the century, the definition had expanded to include bicycles and tricycles. In 1916, the United States Society of Automobile Engineers defined a roadster as: &quot;an open car seating two or three. It may have additional seats on running boards or in rear deck.&quot; Since it has a single row of seats, the main seat for the driver and passenger was usually further back in the chassis than it would have been in a touring car. Roadsters usually had a hooded dashboard.

In the United Kingdom, historically, the preferred terms were &quot;open two-seater&quot; and &quot;two-seat tourer&quot;. Since the 1950s, the term &quot;roadster&quot; has also been increasingly used in the United Kingdom. It is noted that the optional 4-seat variant of the Morgan Roadster would not be technically considered a roadster.

The term &quot;spider&quot; or &quot;spyder,&quot; sometimes used in names for convertible models, is said to come from before the automobile era. Some 19th-century lightweight horse-drawn phaetons had a small body and large wooden wheels with thin spokes; they were nicknamed &quot;spiders&quot; because of their appearance; the nickname was transferred to sports cars, although they did not look similar. 

In 1962, Chevrolet introduced the &quot;Monza Spyder&quot;, a turbocharged version of its Corvair compact, available as a convertible or coupe. Although not a true 2 passenger vehicle, it featured upgraded suspension and other equipment to classify it as a &quot;sporty car.&quot;

== History ==
Auto racing began with the first earnest contests in 1894 in Europe, and in 1895 in the United States. Some of the earliest race cars were purpose-built or stripped for the greatest speed, with minimal or no bodywork at all, leading to a body style aptly named &#x27;speedster&#x27;. The cut-down speedster body-style really took form in the 1900s. After removing most of the body (and fenders), an empty platform on the ladder-frame chassis was mounted with one or two seats, a gas tank, and spare tyres.

American manufacturers Mercer and Stutz started offering ready-made racing speedsters, intentionally built to be driven to race(-track), raced, and driven back by their owner – essentially the first track day cars.

The immediate predecessor to the roadster was the runabout, a body style with a single row of seats and no doors, windshield, or other weather protection. Another predecessor was the touring car, similar in body style to the modern roadster except for its multiple rows of seats. By the 1920s roadsters were appointed similarly to touring cars, with doors, windshields, simple folding tops, and side curtains.

Roadster bodies were offered on automobiles of all sizes and classes, from mass-produced cars like the Ford Model T and the Austin 7 to extremely expensive cars like the Cadillac V-16, the Duesenberg Model J and Bugatti Royale.

By the 1970s &quot;roadster&quot; could be applied to any two-seater car of sporting appearance or character. In response to market demand they were manufactured as well-equipped as convertibles with side windows that retracted into the doors. Popular models through the 1960s and 1970s were the Alfa Romeo Spider, MGB and Triumph TR4.

The highest selling roadster is the Mazda MX-5, which was introduced in 1989. The early style of roadster with minimal weather protection is still in production by several low-volume manufacturers and fabricators, including the windowless Morgan Roadster, the doorless Caterham 7 and the bodyless Ariel Atom.

==IndyCar roadster layout==
The term &quot;roadster&quot; was used to describe a style of racing cars competing in the AAA/USAC Championship Cars series (the IndyCar equivalents of the time) from 1952 to 1969. The roadster engine and drive shaft are offset from the centerline of the car. This allows the driver to sit lower in the chassis and facilitates a weight offset which is beneficial on oval tracks.

One story of why this type of racing car is referred to as a &quot;roadster&quot; is that a team was preparing a new car for the Indianapolis 500. They had it covered in a corner of their shop. If they were asked about their car they would try and obscure its importance by saying that it was just their (hot rod) &quot;roadster&quot;. After the Indianapolis racer was made public, the &quot;roadster&quot; name was still attached to it.

Frank Kurtis built the first roadster to race and entered it in the 1952 Indianapolis 500. It was driven by Bill Vukovich who led for most of the race until a steering failure eliminated him. The Howard Keck owned team with Vukovich driving went on to win the 1953 and 1954 contests with the same car. Bob Sweikert won the 1955 500 in a Kurtis after Vukovich was killed while leading. A. J. Watson, George Salih and Quinn Epperly were other notable roadster constructors. Watson-built roadsters won in 1956, 1959 – 1964 though the 1961 and 1963 winners were actually close copies built from Watson designs. The 1957 and 1958 winner was the same car built by Salih with help by Epperly built with a unique placement of the engine in a &#x27;lay down&#x27; mounting so the cylinders were nearly horizontal instead of vertical as traditional design dictated. This gave a slightly lower center of mass and a lower profile.

Roadsters continued to race until the late 1960s, although they became increasingly uncompetitive against the new rear-engined racing cars. The last roadster to complete the full race distance was in 1965, when Gordon Johncock finished fifth in the Wienberger Homes Watson car. The last roadster to make the race was built and driven by Jim Hurtubise in the 1968 race and dropped out early.

Some pavement midget roadsters were built and raced into the early 1970s but never were dominant.

<text>James Charles Wilson (24 August 1816 – 7 February 1861) was an early settler of Texas and later a state legislator.

Wilson was born in Yorkshire, England, on August 21, 1818. He immigrated to the Republic of Texas in 1836.

In 1842 he joined Charles K. Reese in the ill-fated Somervell Expedition. Captured while serving with the company, he managed to escape on 30 July 1843.

He lived in Brazoria, Texas, where he became district clerk before representing Calhoun, Jackson, Matagorda, and Wharton counties in the House of Representatives of the Third and Fourth Legislatures from 1848 to 1853. In 1856 he became commissioner of the Court of Claims.

In addition to his legal career, Wilson also served as a Methodist minister.

He died in Gonzales on 7 February 1861. Wilson was originally buried in Askey Cemetery near Gonzales but later was moved to the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

Wilson County, Texas, is named in his honor.

<doc id="519887" wikidata="Q1147096" url="?curid=519887" title="Fiber crop">
<text>Fiber crops are field crops grown for their fibers, which are traditionally used to make paper, cloth, or rope.

Fiber crops are characterized by having a large concentration of cellulose, which is what gives them their strength. The fibers may be chemically modified, like in viscose (used to make rayon and cellophane). In recent years, materials scientists have begun exploring further use of these fibers in composite materials. Due to cellulose being the main factor of a plant fiber&#x27;s strength, this is what scientists are looking to manipulate to create different types of fibers.

Fiber crops are generally harvestable after a single growing season, as distinct from trees, which are typically grown for many years before being harvested for such materials as wood pulp fiber or lacebark. In specific circumstances, fiber crops can be superior to wood pulp fiber in terms of technical performance, environmental impact or cost.

There are a number of issues regarding the use of fiber crops to make pulp. One of these is seasonal availability. While trees can be harvested continuously, many field crops are harvested once during the year and must be stored such that the crop doesn&#x27;t rot over a period of many months. Considering that many pulp mills require several thousand tonnes of fiber source per day, storage of the fiber source can be a major issue.

Botanically, the fibers harvested from many of these plants are bast fibers; the fibers come from the phloem tissue of the plant. The other fiber crop fibers are hard/leaf fibers (come from the entirety of plant vascular bundles) and surface fibers (come from plant epidermal tissue).

==Fiber sources==
To have a source of fiber to utilize in production, the fiber first must be extracted from the plant. This is done in different ways depending on the fiber classification. Bast fibers are harvested through retting which is where microbes are utilized to remove soft tissues from the plant and only the useful fibrous material remains. Hard fibers are harvested mainly through decortication which is where the non-fibrous tissues are removed by hand or machine. Lastly, surface fibers are harvested through ginning which is where a machine removes the fibers from other plant material.

===Paper===

Before the industrialisation of paper production the most common fiber source was recycled fibers from used textiles, called rags. The rags were from ramie, hemp, linen and cotton. A process for removing printing inks from recycled paper was invented by German jurist Justus Claproth in 1774. Today this method is called deinking. It was not until the introduction of wood pulp in 1843 that paper production was not dependent on recycled materials from ragpickers.

<doc id="519901" wikidata="Q877998" url="?curid=519901" title="Students' union">
<text>A students&#x27; union or student union, is a student organization present in many colleges, universities, and high schools. In higher education, the students&#x27; union is often accorded its own building on the campus, dedicated to social, organizational activities, representation, and academic support of the membership. It may also be a club.

In the United States, &quot;student union&quot; often only refers to a physical building owned by the university with the purpose of providing services for students without a governing body. This building is also referred to as a student activity center, although the Association of College Unions International (largely US-based) has hundreds of campus organizational members. Outside the US, &quot;student union&quot; and &quot;students&#x27; union&quot; more often refer to a representative body, as distinct from a &quot;student activity centre&quot; building, and may also refer to a building run by that representative body.

==Purpose==
Depending on the country, the purpose, assembly, method, and implementation of the group might vary. Universally, the purpose of students&#x27; union or student government is to represent fellow students in some fashion.

In some cases, students&#x27; unions are run by students, independent of the educational facility. The purpose of these organizations is to represent students both within the institution and externally, including on local and national issues. Students&#x27; unions are also responsible for providing a variety of services to students. Depending on the organization&#x27;s makeup, students can get involved in the union by becoming active in a committee, by attending councils and general meetings, volunteering within a group, service or club run by the union, or by becoming an elected officer.

Some students&#x27; unions are politicized bodies, and often serve as a training ground for aspiring politicians. Students&#x27; unions generally have similar aims irrespective of the extent of politicization, usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services.

Some students&#x27; unions often officially recognize and allocate an annual budget to other organizations on campus. In some institutions, postgraduate students are within the general students&#x27; unions, whereas in others they have their own postgraduate representative body. In some cases, graduate students lack formal representation in student government.

==Variations depending on country==
As mentioned before universally the purpose of students&#x27; union or student government is to represent fellow students. Many times students&#x27; unions usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services. Simple variations on just the name include the name differences between the United States (student government) and other countries (students&#x27; union or student association). Depending on the country there are different methods of representation compulsory education to Higher education or tertiary.

===Asia and Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, all universities have one or more student organizations.

Australian student unions typically provide such services as eateries, small retail outlets (e.g., news agencies), student media (e.g., campus newspapers), advocacy, and support for a variety of social, arts, political, recreational, special interest and sporting clubs and societies. Most also operate specialized support services for female, LGBT, international and indigenous students. Many expressed concerns over the introduction of voluntary student unionism (VSU) in 2006.

In 2011, the Government passed legislation to allow universities to charge students a compulsory service fee to fund amenities such as sporting facilities, childcare and counselling, as well as student media and &quot;advocating students&#x27; interests&quot;.

The National Union of Students of Australia represents post school students at a national level; the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations is the umbrella organisation for postgraduate students&#x27; unions.

====Azerbaijan====
Azerbaijan Students Union (ASU) was established by students from Baku on 15 September 2008. ASU is an organization which was established on basis of international experience and it was the first student organization which united students irrespective of gender, race, creed, nationality.

During its action period ASU has formed stable structure, presented new suggestions about student policy to appropriate bodies, made close relations with international and regional student organizations, prepared new action plan according to the universities-students-companies&#x27; relations in Azerbaijan.

ASU considered international relations very important. For the first time ASU&#x27;s delegates were participants of the First Asia IAESTE Forum in Shanghai during 12–15 November 2009. After that forum ASU established close relations with IAESTE which is one of the biggest student exchange organizations. As a result of relations on 21 January 2010 ASU was accepted a member of IAESTE. The union gained right to represent Azerbaijan students in IAESTE. That membership was the union&#x27;s first success on international level. During 20–27 January Azerbaijan Students Union was accepted as associative member of IAESTE in 64th Annual Conference in Thailand. Azerbaijan Students Union has been a full member of European Students&#x27; Union until 2015.

====China====
In China, the student body is usually referred to as 学生会 () or 学生联合会 ().

Membership in different universities has different functions. Some universities may give the membership a task of recording the students&#x27; attendance and the complex grades. Student associations of Chinese universities are mostly under the leadership of Communist Youth League of China, which to a large extent limit its function as an organization purely belonging to students themselves.

====Hong Kong====
All universities in Hong Kong had students&#x27; unions until the Hong Kong national security law came into effect in 2020, when the many students&#x27; unions were forced to disband under political pressure. Most of these students&#x27; unions were members of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. Many secondary schools also have students&#x27; unions or the equivalent. Students&#x27; unions are called student council and students&#x27; association in some secondary schools. Students&#x27; unions in secondary schools and universities are elected democratically and universally by the student population, and the cabinet winning a simple majority becomes the new students&#x27; union of the year. Students&#x27; union maintain quite a hierarchical structure.

====India====
India has developed a complex tradition of student politics dating from the era of Indian National Congress movement domination. Student unions are organised both within universities, like the Student Council of IISc and across universities, All India Students Federation (AISF) is the oldest student organisation in India founded on August 12, 1936. AISF is the only students organisation in the country which was actively involved in the Indian freedom struggle, but affiliated with political parties, as in the case of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, Muslim Students Federation, Students Federation of India, National Students Union of India etc. who compete in elections to control posts in universities and colleges. Examples of activist unions include the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students&#x27; Union, Delhi University Students Union, Udai pratap college students Union Swaero Student Union. Recently few school administrations had also started including the student government system as co-curricular activities in one form or another. There is one of a kind, non-political independent architectural students body, National Association of Students of Architecture.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, every university, college and higher education school has a student union.

The official student union in junior and senior high school is usually called &quot;Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah&quot; (Intra-School Student Organization, abbreviated as &quot;OSIS&quot;), is formed by the school. A general election to choose the leader is usually held every year. OSIS organizes the school&#x27;s extracurricular activities such as music shows and art gallery (&quot;pentas seni/pensi&quot;).

The student union in universities is commonly called &quot;Badan Eksekutif Mahasiswa&quot; (Student Executive Board, abbreviated as &quot;BEM&quot;), though the official name could be vary between universities or faculties. Most of BEMs are affiliated with several national unions, such as All-Indonesian BEM (BEM SI) or BEM Nusantara (BEMNUS).

====Japan====
In Japan, the student body is called 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai). In Japanese, the word 学生自治会 (gakusei-jichi-kai) means students&#x27; self-government-organizations. The student body in Japan promotes extracurricular activities. Usually, a cultural association, 文化会 (bunka-kai), and a sports association, 体育会 (taiiku-kai), are included within a student body as autonomous organizations. A student belongs to one or more students&#x27; organizations, and he or she does extracurricular activities through these students&#x27; organizations. However, the extracurricular activities of universities and colleges have been declining since the 1990s.

There is no nationwide student union in Japan that participates in university administration or university management.

====Malaysia====

Malaysia has 20 public universities. Each of them has one students&#x27; representative council (), the highest student body of such university as stipulated in the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (AUKU).The registered students of the University, other than external students, shall together constitute a body to be known as the Students&#x27; Union of the University, and the Union shall elect a Students&#x27; Representative Council. (Article 48 Section 1-2, Universities and University Colleges Act)A general election is held every year, usually in November (With the exception of University of Malaya in July), to elect representatives to MPP. The percentage of voter turn-outs are usually high (70 to 95 percent) largely due to enforcements from the universities&#x27; management which, at the same time, acts as the Election Committee. Amendments on the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 in 2019 allows students to be fully in-charge of the Election Committee.

Every year, the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education would set meetings and arrange programmes with all MPPs. Nevertheless, each MPP has their own autonomous right to govern their own membership. The size of MPP differs from each university, from as little as 12 to as many as 50, which may include non-associate members from student leaders representing their respective student body. All MPP members are part-time and unpaid officers.

In 2011, Universiti Sains Malaysia established Students&#x27; Consultative Assembly (), the first student parliament established and the oldest of its kind in Malaysia, to involve participation of more student leaders in decision and policy making as well as to establish a legislative branch in its Students&#x27; Union system instead of having the only executive branch. A university student parliament is composed of MPP members and other elected or appointed student leaders representing their respective student body, along with the presence of the management&#x27;s and students&#x27; representative as observers. In 2020, Universiti Utara Malaysia revived the Students&#x27; Parliament () as the legislative branch in its Students&#x27; Union system which was left dormant since its last meeting at 2013 and the next meeting since its revival was held in April 2021. As at May 2021, 8 public universities in Malaysia had their student parliament established.

However, there were several disputes regarding the autonomy of the MPP, since executive decisions were depending upon the advice of the Students&#x27; Affairs Department (), especially among several students&#x27; rights activists, who insists that the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971 (AUKU) to be abolished and replaced with a new act to &#x27;revive&#x27; students&#x27; autonomy on administration as in the 1960s&#x27;.

====New Zealand====
Students associations have a strong history in New Zealand of involvement in political causes, notably the Halt All Racist Tours campaign during the 1981 Springbok Tour. All universities, and most polytechnics and colleges of education have a students association. Since the economic reforms of the 1990s and the introduction of user pays in tertiary education, students associations and the national body have shifted their focus to challenging inequities in the student loan scheme and high levels of student debt. Part-time work alongside the introduction of internal assessment and the change of semester structure has been attributed to the declining involvement in extracurricular activities and a shift in focus of the student movement from mass protest to lobbying.

Previous to 1998 membership of Students&#x27; Associations (pep) was compulsory at all public Tertiary Education providers (universities, polytechnics and colleges of education). In 1997 the centre-right National party proposed the Voluntary Student Membership amendment to the Education act which would have made membership of Students&#x27; Associations voluntary at all Tertiary Education Providers.

However the National Party relied on support from the centrist New Zealand First party to pass legislation. The New Zealand First party preferred that Tertiary Students themselves choose whether their provider should be voluntary or compulsory and pushed through a compromise to the amendment that allowed for a Compulsory Vs Voluntary referendum to be held at every public Tertiary Education Provider. The amendment also allowed for subsequent referendums which could not be held until at least two years had passed since the previous referendum and only if a petition was signed by 10% of the student populace.

The first wave of referendums were held in 1999, in which several Polytechnics and two Universities (the University of Waikato and the University of Auckland) elected to become voluntary. In 2002 a second referendum was held at the University of Waikato and students choose to return to compulsory student membership. Similar referendums at Auckland University in 2001, 2003 and 2005 have all elected to retain voluntary student membership.

Most of New Zealand Tertiary students&#x27; associations are confederated under the New Zealand Union of Students&#x27; Associations.

====Philippines====
Student unions in the Philippines are referred to as student government and/or student council (). They are vital organizations for student representation and advancing the struggle of the people for their democratic rights and freedoms. At the primary and secondary level, student unions are referred to as pupil government handled by the Department of Education under their Student Government Program. Meanwhile, at the tertiary level, private and state colleges and universities have their own student councils. As universities may further be subdivided into colleges with their own specializations (e.g., College of Law, College of Medicine, College of Arts and Sciences, etc.), the highest student representation will usually be referred to as the &quot;university student council&quot; while the student representation of these colleges will be called &quot;college student council(s)&quot;.

Student councils, especially those in universities, have a history of activism in the local and national level due to various socio-political and economic issues, with the First Quarter Storm and the Diliman Commune being two of many examples.

Aside from student unions, students are further represented in overall decision-making of their respective university&#x27;s governing body through the student regent (e.g., UP Office of the Student Regent for the students of the University of the Philippines System). The student regent is a consequence of tireless and continuous struggle of the students to be represented in the highest policy-making body of their respective universities such as the school board where the student regent has voting powers, among others. Student regents are very common for universities with campuses in different locations and most especially in state universities and colleges. 

On the other hand, these student unions are also connected throughout the country through various alliances or networks such as the National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP), which serves as a nationwide alliance of student councils/governments/unions committed to the advancement of the students&#x27; democratic rights and welfare since its establishment in 1957.

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, each state university has several Students&#x27; unions with formal links to respective faculties. Inter University Students&#x27; Federation is the umbrella organization of 14 unions of university students. However, most of these have political affiliations and function as proxies of these political factions. Many unions take an active political role within the university and in the country as a whole. This frequently lead to much clashes between rival students&#x27; unions or the authorities.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, the student body is called 學生會 () or 學生自治會 (), these groups are often known as student association and students&#x27; union, or less commonly a student government. The law requires all universities and high schools should have a Student Association. Many universities student association in Taiwan are members of the National Students&#x27; Union of Taiwan ().

==== Myanmar ====

The role of students&#x27; unions in Myanmar were attached with Politics. From 1920, the students&#x27; union were outcoming and tried to get the Interdependence of Nation. There were many students boycotts in Myanmar: 1920, 1936, 1962, 1974-75-76, 1988, 1996, 2007 and recently 2015 March. Most of them were connected with political issues.

===Africa===
In South Africa student representative councils are the executive and plenary body of student governance and charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students&#x27; interests when dealing with the administration. In several instances representatives of these bodies are members of the university&#x27;s Senate.

In 2012 the first student union in Libya, after 42 years of suppression, was founded. Students from Al Mimona Ebem Alharth school public school in Tripoli-Libya successfully established the union and promoted for other schools around the country to do the same. The founder Alaa Amed received local media attention for this achievement. 
While higher education and student activism might vary depending on the country the National Association of Nigerian Students&#x27; is an organization with well over 50 university union across the nation.

Tunisia has many students unions including the Union Générale des Étudiants de Tunisie founded in 1952, and Union Générale Tunisienne des Étudiants founded in 1985.

===Europe===
While each students&#x27; union varies by countries the European Students&#x27; Union is an umbrella organization of 45 national unions of students from 36 European countries.

====Armenia====
The Armenian National Students Association was established in September 2003 and represents 90 thousand students across Armenia. It is a member of the European Students&#x27; Union. The National Youth Council of Armenia was established in 1997 and represents 70 student and youth structures throughout Armenia. 

====Denmark====
In Denmark the higher education system comprises two parallel sectors: universities and university colleges of applied sciences (e.g. nursing and engineering schools or teachers&#x27; colleges). Universities are characterised by scientific research and the highest education based thereon. University colleges of applied sciences are oriented towards working life and base their operations on the high vocational skill requirements set by it. These vocational institutions offer 3-4 year &#x27;professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees&#x27;. Besides that there are a number of art schools. Universities belong under the Ministry of Science, University Colleges belong under the Ministry of Education, and the Art Schools belong under the Ministry of Culture. There are 12 universities at the moment, but in 2006 there is a major merger process going on to make fewer, bigger institutions. The student unions at universities (and some of the art schools&#x27; student unions) are generally members of the National Union of Students in Denmark which represents these students on the national level.

Every university has a student union (In Danish, &quot;Studenterråd&quot;). Membership is not mandatory. The student unions are funded by the university and the Ministry of Science on the basis of the percentage of votes received every year at the university election. The student union is autonomous, its internal life organized by its by-laws. The student unions are responsible for all representation of the students and elect the student members of different administrative organs. They usually coordinate and finance the activities of smaller, more specialized student organizations. For the financing of their activities, some student unions exact a membership fee and/or engage in different businesses.

In the Ministry of Culture institutions there are also local student organisations. In the Ministry of Education institutions, The student activities are very much related to a student division of the Labor Union in the different areas. For instance, the teachers&#x27; students are organised in the national labor union for teachers and so forth.

The Upper-Secondary schools (In Danish, &quot;Gymnasier&quot;), It is in Denmark a law that there has to be a student council at the Upper-Secondary schools. The student councils are organized in the following organisations:

====Finland====
====France====

The central organization of the French higher education system means that local university bodies have restricted decision-making power. As a consequence, student unions are generally established at national level with local sections in most universities. The largest national student unions have a strong political identity and their actions are generally restricted to the defense of their vision of higher education rather than being focused on the particular interests of the membership of a single university. Union membership is regarded as an essentially political decision, without any particular advantage for students. The strength of unions is often measured by their effectiveness in national protests rather than by membership figures. The National Union of Students of France (UNEF) is the oldest French student union created in 1907. It laid the modern foundations of student unionism in France in 1946 when it adopted the Charter of Grenoble.

There are also class-struggle student unions such as the Solidaires Étudiant-e-s (formed in January 2013 through the fusion of the former organizations SUD Étudiant and Féderation syndicale étudiante (FSE)) which refuse to cooperate with the universities&#x27; direction and work to organize students. Or radical-right student organizations like the student cockade

In the grandes écoles, the premium league in the French higher education system, students are generally members of the official Student Office (Bureau des étudiants or Bureau des élèves) in charge of the organization of social activities and sports events. The constitutions of these societies, which work in close partnership with the school administration, usually prevent union members from running for executive positions in order to keep the school independent from political groups liable to harm the school&#x27;s prestige.

===== High school students&#x27; union =====

The first high school organizations appear sporadically with social movements since the mid-1960s.

Modern French high school unionism appeared after the Devaquet Law Project which had sparked a mass mobilization of high school and university students in November and December 1986 : In 1987 the was founded. This organization was the first to claim syndicalism. It is the oldest French high school students union still in operation.

Others high school students unions referring to syndicalism will follow: in 1994, the national high school students&#x27; union was created after the social movement against the professional integration contract bill. In 2009, the and then in 2016, the National High School Student Movement, were born out of a split with the national high school student union.

====Germany====
In Germany the actual form of student representation depends strongly on the federal state. In most states there is a General Students&#x27; Committee () at every university. It is the executive organ of the parliaments and councils of all faculties.

====Greece====
In Greece every university department has its corresponding student union (in Greek: Σύλλογος Φοιτητών) and all students belonging to the department have the right to register as members. The main objective of a student union is to solve students&#x27; problems that can either be related to academic life or have a general political and social nature. Furthermore, student unions organize and support numerous activities such as political debates, demonstrations, university occupations, educational lectures, cultural and artistic events, conferences and so on.

The structure of a student union is rather simple and comprises two bodies: The General Students&#x27; Assembly (Greece) and the board of directors. The general assembly consists of all student-members of the union. It takes place on a regular basis and is the only decision-making body. During the general assembly, many topics of student interest are discussed and the decisions are taken after open vote. The board of directors makes sure that the decisions of the general assembly will be materialized. Moreover, the members of the board of directors, among which is the union&#x27;s president, participate in various university administrative bodies as representatives of all students in the union.

Every year in early spring the student elections take place nationwide, during which students vote for their representatives. All student unions in Greece are members of the &quot;National Student Union of Greece&quot; (ΕΦΕΕ - Εθνική Φοιτητική Ένωση Ελλάδας).

====Ireland====

Most of Ireland&#x27;s universities and colleges have students&#x27; unions which were established to represent the students in the context of internal college issues and on wider student related issues and also a means of solidarity with other movements globally. An ongoing campaign of virtually every students&#x27; union in Ireland is to prevent the reintroduction of tuition fees which were abolished in 1995. Most, but not all, of the students&#x27; unions are affiliated with the Union of Students in Ireland. Notably, two of the seven university students&#x27; unions are not members. The students&#x27; unions are operated in accordance with the rules set down in their constitution which invariable enumerates a strong democratic and inclusive procedure for the governance on the union. Some Students&#x27; Unions run retail businesses in the interests of its students and run referendums, such as on whether or not to support same-sex marriage or abortion.

All Universities and Institutes of Technologies in the Republic of Ireland have Students&#x27; Unions.

National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), the student movement in Northern Ireland was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the UK National Union of Students (NUS) and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), to address the particular problems of representing students in Northern Ireland.

====Netherlands====
There are several students&#x27; unions in The Netherlands which act as labor unions for students. The largest ones are VSSD in Delft and ASVA Studentenunie in Amsterdam. These students&#x27; unions are all members of LSVb, the national students&#x27; union. There&#x27;s also a similar organization called ISO (Interstedelijk Studenten Overleg), which consists of several formal participation organizations, as well as ASVA Studentenunie and VSSD. Both ISO and LSVb are members of European Students&#x27; Union.

Lastly, the Netherlands has an (unofficial) student union for its students that study abroad: Netherlands Worldwide Students or simply NEWS.

The Netherlands is also home to an unusual case of student representation in which a local political party completely run by student gained seats during local town hall elections, STIP.

====Norway====
In Norway, every university is instructed and required by law to have a student union elected by the students at the university. Additionally, Norwegian law requires two students to be appointed as members of the board of directors for all universities. The goal for every student union is to act as the official voice of the students towards the university&#x27;s administration and rector, informing them on the students&#x27; perspectives on most issues at the institution, either academic or administrative. They often additionally seek to improve their school environment through encouraging social, cultural and other extracurricular events in the local community. Each student union in Norway is governed by a board of directors that is elected directly from the Student Council. In addition, most upper secondary schools in Norway are affiliated with the School Student Union of Norway.

====Portugal====
In Portugal, every university, polytechnic institute and any other higher education schools has their own students&#x27; unions. Union organizations are generally aimed to organize and promote extracurricular activities such as sports and culture events, parties, and academic festivities. At the same time, they also act as &quot;labour unions for students&quot; promoting and defending the students&#x27; points of view and rights, and dealing with the teaching institutions and the State&#x27;s education agencies policies. The oldest union of Portugal is the Associação Académica de Coimbra (founded in 1887) which belongs to the students of the University of Coimbra. The biggest students&#x27; union is Associação Académica da Universidade de Lisboa.

====Sweden====
At Swedish universities, students&#x27; unions are responsible for representing the students in evaluation of the education and decision-making within the universities. Not Swedish universities are affiliated with the Swedish National Union of Students. The union normally holds about one-third of the votes within every decision-making body and thus holds a great deal of power.

The unions are usually governed by a general assembly of elected representatives. Students&#x27; unions generally provide counselling services to its members and publishes their own magazines or newspapers. Large universities often have several students&#x27; unions, where the smaller students&#x27; unions only provide basic services. Larger students&#x27; unions often own and run their own facilities at the university such as shops, restaurants and night clubs.

====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom has a long history of student unionism at a local and national level. The oldest students&#x27; union in Britain (as distinct from a primarily social union society) was the Student Representative Council formed at the University of Edinburgh in 1884. Most bodies are termed &quot;unions&quot;, however there exist a number of &quot;guilds&quot; and &quot;students&#x27; associations&quot;. Students&#x27; association is a popular term in Scotland, as historically there were separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s unions focused on societies and entertainment with representation to the university carried out by separate students&#x27; representative councils. Most students&#x27; unions in the UK are affiliated to the National Union of Students, although there exist other national representative bodies, such the National Postgraduate Committee, the Coalition of Higher Education Students in Scotland and the Aldwych Group, the association of students&#x27; unions of members of the Russell Group.

National Union of Students-Union of Students in Ireland (NUS-USI), the student movement in Northern Ireland was formed in 1972 by bilateral agreement between the UK National Union of Students (NUS) and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), to address the particular problems of representing students in Northern Ireland.

Under the Education Act 1994, the role and purpose of students&#x27; unions is defined as being &quot;promoting the general interests of its members as students&quot;. This has limited the ability of students&#x27; unions to campaign on issues not directly related to their members as students, such as Apartheid and the 1984–85 miners&#x27; strike.

===The Americas===

====Canada====

In Canada, the existence of a college or university students&#x27; union and the membership of those who attend the institutions is mandatory across Canada under various provincial statutes. Included in Canadian students&#x27; tuition fees is anywhere from an additional $10–$500 fee to pay for the services of the union for either undergraduate or graduate support. The money raised from dues is used to support, programs, services, advocacy, salaries, part-time staff costs, overhead costs and a variety of other general costs. Student elections typically happen prior to the end of the previous educational year as the membership elect their unions&#x27; executives for the following year. The current largest undergraduate student union in Canada is the York Federation of Students, at York University, with around 60,000 members.

Most students&#x27; unions are charged by their membership to protect their best interests at the university, municipal, provincial and federal government levels. Advocating for support from the provincial government for areas such as lower tuition fees, support for sexual and gender based violence, and financial support, as well as creating position papers and providing research to support various causes. Many students&#x27; unions in Canada are members of one of the national student organizations, the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA) or the Canadian Federation of Students (CFS). Those that belong to the CFS at the national level also belong to the CFS at the provincial level. Those that do not belong to the CFS may belong to a provincial student organization like the New Brunswick Student Alliance, the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (OUSA), the College Student Alliance, StudentsNS (formerly known as ANSSA), the Alliance of British Columbia Students, the Council of Alberta University Students, or the Alberta Students Executive Council. In Quebec, the provincial student organizations are the Quebec Federation of University Students (&quot;Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec&quot; or FEUQ) for university students, college students are represented by the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec or FECQ, while the Association pour une solidarité syndicale étudiante or ASSE includes students from both the undergraduate and graduate levels of education.

Different provinces have different rules governing student unions. In British Columbia under section 27.1 of the University Act, student unions may only raise or rescind mandatory student union fees through a democratic referendum of the membership. Once fees are passed through this mechanism, the board of governors of the respective institutions are then required to remit those fees to the student union, and may only interfere in the internal affairs of the student union if it fails to complete annual audits of its finances, giving these student unions strong autonomy over their institutions. In Ontario, the autonomy of student unions is set by standards outlined by each institution, giving university administrators a broader scope of powers over the finances of student unions. Ontario educational institutions may only revoke collecting fees on behalf of the students&#x27; union if they are in contravention of the Corporations Act of Ontario. Other provinces have governing acts specific to the institutions, such as The University of Manitoba Students&#x27; Union Act.

Students&#x27; Unions in Canada typically offer a variety of services such as LGBTQ2+ groups, Women&#x27;s Centre&#x27;s, Food Banks, Bicycle Repair Shops, Campus First Aid teams, Walksafe programs, Peer Support groups and Racialized Student Support, among other offerings and independent student groups. Unions also generally offer health and dental plans, termly bus passes at costs negotiated with the local transit authority, and other student assistance programs. Funding options are also a part of many student unions&#x27; including endowment funds, funding for student clubs and for orientation. Students&#x27; unions are also programmers for the beginning of term events such as Welcome Week, Frost Week and other events throughout the term that provide social connections and wellness for students. Advocacy is also a main portion of what a students&#x27; union does including connecting with the university or College to advocate for changes to programs, co-op, and affordability. They also advocate for housing and tenant rights, safety, quality of education, academic rights, transportation concerns, accessibility, diversity and equity and health and wellness.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, students unions are mostly predominant in universities. Mexican universities have an elected student committee each year, but the faculties or schools within the universities have also their own union. This practice is also extended to other levels of education, such as high and junior high school, but to a lesser extent. An example of this is the Sociedad de Alumnos de HPA Mexico.

Jesuit student groups played an important role in Mexico&#x27;s history, particularly in opposing the imposition of socialist education in Mexico in the 1930s. Leaders from the &quot;Unión Nacional de Estudiantes Católicos&quot; (UNEC) had long-term importance in Mexico&#x27;s political history, since a number of them helped form the conservative National Action Party (Mexico).

====United States====

In the United States, these groups are often known as student government, associated students, student senate, or less commonly a students&#x27; union. In the U.S., the phrase &quot;student union&quot; often refers to a &quot;student activity center&quot; (also known as a &quot;student center&quot; or &quot;student commons&quot;), a building with dining halls, game rooms, lounges, student offices, and other spaces for student activities. At institutions with large graduate, medical school, and individual &quot;college&quot; populations, there are often student governments that serve those specific constituencies.

====Brazil====

The Brazilian Society

This society has existed since 2003 and now has 190 members, where only one third are Brazilian. The other two thirds are people who are just interested in Brazilian politics, famous parties and culture. This is one of the societies that students may join if they so wish. The society has social events and it hosts lectures. They also have a Brazilian discussion group on a weekly basis in order to discuss current events.

=== Middle East ===

==== Israel ====
The National Union of Israeli Students (NUIS) is the sole organization that represents over 300,000 students of 61 higher education institutes and vocational schools in Israel. We believe that the young age group of Israel, comprising almost half of the Israel&#x27;s population, is the living force of society. NUIS was established in 1934, before establishment the state of Israel.

The Student Union&#x27;s main activity is to widespread and include a variety of activities portraying its worldview regarding the students&#x27; role, responsibilities and benefits within the Israeli society. The union is composed of professional departments enacting the decisions made for, and with the student community, in addition to local student unions in each of the higher education institutes. The central role of the union is to protect the student&#x27;s status and rights, while strengthening its social purpose as the leading organization driving lively activities among the students.

<text>A spaniel is a type of gun dog. Spaniels were especially bred to flush game out of denser brush. By the late 17th century, spaniels had been specialized into water and land breeds. The extinct English Water Spaniel was used to retrieve water fowl shot down with arrows. Land spaniels were setting spaniels—those that crept forward and pointed their game, allowing hunters to ensnare them with nets, and springing spaniels — those that sprang pheasants and partridges (for hunting with falcon) and also rabbits and smaller mammals such as rats and mice (for hunting with greyhounds). During the 17th century, the role of the spaniel dramatically changed as Englishmen began hunting with flintlocks for wing shooting. Charles Goodall and Julia Gasow (1984) write that spaniels were &quot;transformed from untrained, wild beaters, to smooth, polished gun dogs.&quot;

The word &quot;spaniel&quot; would seem to be derived from the medieval French &quot;espaigneul&quot;&quot;Spanish&quot;to modern French, &quot;espagnol&quot;.

==Definition and description==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines Spaniel as &quot;a breed of dog with a long silky coat and drooping ears&quot;.

Not much has changed about spaniels in general over the years, as can be seen in this 1921 entry in &quot;Collier&#x27;s New Encyclopedia&quot;:

Their distinguishing characteristics are a rather broad muzzle, remarkably long and full ears, hair plentiful and beautifully waved, particularly that of the ears, tail, and hinder parts of the thighs and legs. The prevailing color is liver and white, sometimes red and white or black and white, and sometimes deep brown, or black on the face and breast, with a tan spot over each eye. The English spaniel is a superior and very pure breed. The King Charles is a small variety of the spaniel used as a lapdog. The water spaniels, large and small, differ from the common spaniel only in the roughness of their coats, and in uniting the aquatic propensities of the Newfoundland dog with the fine hunting qualities of their own race. Spaniels possess a great share of intelligence, affection, and obedience, which qualities, combined with much beauty, make them highly prized as companions.

==History==
The origin of the word &quot;spaniel&quot; is described by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as coming from the Old French word &quot;espaigneul&quot; which meant &quot;Spanish (dog)&quot;; this in turn originated from the Latin &quot;Hispaniolus&quot; which simply means &quot;Spanish&quot;.

In Edward, 2nd Duke of York&#x27;s work &quot;The Master of Game&quot;, which was mostly a 15th-century translation of an earlier work by Gaston III of Foix-Béarn entitled &quot;Livre de chasse&quot;, spaniels are described as being from Spain as much as all Greyhounds are from England or Scotland. Sixteenth-century English physician John Caius wrote that the spaniels of the time were mostly white, marked with spots that are commonly red. He described a new variety to have come out of France, which were speckled all over with white and black, &quot;which mingled colours incline to a marble blewe&quot;.

===Celtic origin theory===
In the appendices added to the 1909 re-print of Caius&#x27; work, the editors suggested that the type of dogs may have been brought into the British Isles as early as 900 BC by a branch of the Celts moving from Spain into Cornwall and on into Wales, England and Ireland. Theories on the origin of the Welsh Springer Spaniel support this theory, as it is believed that the breed specifically is a direct descendant of the &quot;Agassian hunting dog&quot; described in the hunting poem &quot;Cynegetica&quot; attributed to Oppian of Apamea, which belonged to the Celtic tribes of Roman Britain:

There is a strong breed of hunting dog, small in size but no less worthy of great praise. These the wild tribes of Britons with their tattooed backs rear and call by the name of Agassian. Their size is like that of worthless and greedy domestic table dogs; squat, emaciated, shaggy, dull of eye, but endowed with feet armed with powerful claws and a mouth sharp with close-set venomous tearing teeth. It is by virtue of its nose, however, that the Agassian is most exalted, and for tracking it is the best there is; for it is very adept at discovering the tracks of things that walk upon the ground, and skilled too at marking the airborne scent.

===Roman origin theory===
Another theory of the origin of the spaniel is that the ancient Romans imported spaniels into Britannia by way of the trade routes to the Far East. Colonel David Hancock adds a belief that the sporting type of spaniel originated in China from the short-faced ancestors of dogs such as the Pekingese, Pug and Shih Tzu. The theory goes that these ancestors were introduced into Southern Europe and evolved into the small sporting spaniels of the period around AD 1300–1600. The issue of how a short-muzzled dog could evolve into a longer-muzzled dog is addressed by pointing to the evolution of the King Charles Spaniel into the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in less than a century.

==Hunting==

In assisting hunters, it is desirable that spaniels work within gun range, are steady to shot, and are able to mark the fall and retrieve shot game to hand with a soft mouth. A good nose is highly valued, as it is in most gun dog breeds. They are versatile hunters traditionally being used for upland game birds, but are equally adept at hunting rabbits, waterfowl, rats, and mice. Whether hunting in open fields, woodlands, farm lands—in briars, along fencerows or marshlands, a spaniel can get the job done.

On the basis of function and hunting style, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) draws a distinction between Continental and Anglo-American spaniels. The FCI places Continental dogs of the spaniel type in the pointing group (Group 7, sect. 1.2) because they function more like setters which &quot;freeze&quot; and point to game. Breeds in this group include the Blue Picardy Spaniel, the French Spaniel, the Brittany, the Pont-Audemer Spaniel, and the Small Münsterländer. The FCI classifies most other dogs of the spaniel type as flushing or water dogs (Group 8, sections 2 and 3).

<text>Edward Lasker (born Eduard Lasker) (December 3, 1885 – March 25, 1981) was a German-American chess and Go player. He was awarded the title of International Master of chess by FIDE. Lasker was an engineer by profession, and an author of books on Go, chess and checkers. Born in Prussia, he emigrated to the United States in 1914. He was distantly related to World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker with whom he is sometimes confused.

==Early life and education==
Lasker was born in Kempen, Province of Posen, Prussia, German Empire (present-day Kępno, Poland), the son of Sigismund Lasker and Flora Bornstein. He studied in Breslau (now Wrocław) and in Charlottenburg (now part of Berlin).

Lasker earned undergraduate degrees at the Technische Hochschule in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, graduating in 1910.

==Engineering career==
Before World War I he moved first to London and then, in 1914 shortly after the outbreak of war, to the U.S., the birthplace of his mother. He found a job in Chicago, working for Sears &amp; Roebuck as a safety engineer. When the United States entered the war in 1917, he was sent enlistment papers, but with the right of exemption as a German. He waived his right to exemption, which he said would make his American citizenship be granted more quickly; however, the war was over before he was called up to military service.

In 1921–23, he invented a mechanical breast pump, which saved many premature infants&#x27; lives and made Lasker much money, although it caused his friends to refer to him facetiously as &quot;the chest player&quot;.

==Chess==

His chess teacher in Breslau was Arnold Schottländer. In Berlin, he won the City Championship (1909) and wrote his first chess book titled &quot;Chess Strategy&quot; (&quot;Schachstrategie&quot;, 1911) which had many English and German editions.

Lasker published several books on American checkers, chess, and Go. He won five U.S. Open Chess Championships (1916, 1917, 1919, 1920, 1921); this tournament was known at the time as the Western Open. His best result was his narrow 8½–9½ loss in a match with Frank Marshall for the U.S. Championship in 1923; this result was achieved even after Lasker had to take a postponement while leading the match due to a severe kidney stone attack.

For that, Lasker was invited to participate in the legendary New York 1924 chess tournament, a double round robin featuring such world class players as Alekhine, Efim Bogoljubov, Capablanca, Emanuel Lasker, and Réti. He finished tenth out of eleven players, but many of his games were competitive. For instance, he split with Alekhine, won games against Réti and Savielly Tartakower, both of whom were Top 10 in the world at the time according to the estimated rankings of the website Chessmetrics.com, drew Capablanca and drew a famous game against Emanuel Lasker.

This game was truly extraordinary, as the former World Champion lost a pronounced advantage and was only able to hold the draw against Edward by demonstrating that the inferior side can hold the draw in certain types of endings of rook and knight pawn versus a lone knight. The game lasted 103 moves and changed endgame theory, as no one had demonstrated this particular draw before in theory or practice. Lasker was the only chess amateur in the very strong field of professionals.

His most famous game is probably the queen sacrifice and king hunt against Sir George Thomas. After Lasker checkmated him, Thomas said, &quot;This was very nice.&quot; Lasker, who had yet to learn English, was touched by Thomas&#x27;s sportsmanship after a spectator translated Thomas&#x27;s remark into German for him. Lasker wrote that had he won the game against a leading Berlin amateur, his opponent would likely have told him, &quot;You are just lucky! Had I played [10...Bxe5] instead of [...Qe7], you would have been lost.&quot;

Although Lasker never won against Capablanca, he drew as Black against him at the 1924 New York tournament. Lasker was not usually so fortunate; for example, Capablanca once arrived one minute before he would have forfeited the game for late arrival, at New York 1915, and Lasker played the Riga variation of the Ruy Lopez with which he had some experience, but Capablanca found an advantageous continuation and won.

==Go==

Lasker was deeply impressed by Go. He first read about it in a magazine article by Oskar Korschelt which suggested Go as a rival to chess, a claim that he found amusing. Later on his interest was piqued again when he noticed the record of a Go game on the back of a Japanese newspaper being read by a customer of a cafe where they played chess.

He and his friend Dr. Max Lange (1883–1923) – not to be confused with the more famous 19th-century chess master Max Lange – took the paper after he had left, and deciphered the diagram, but the game was not complete. The position led them to assume that the notation under the game would indicate a Black victory, but being unable to read Japanese, they had to ask another Japanese customer at the cafe. To their surprise, it was a resignation by Black. Only after three weeks of study was Max Lange able to understand the reason for White&#x27;s victory. This experience led them to a deeper appreciation for the game, and they studied it in earnest, but were unable to interest other chess players.

After two years, Emanuel Lasker, then the world chess champion, returned to Germany from the United States. When Edward told him that he had found a game to rival chess, he was skeptical, but after being told the rules, and playing one game, he understood that Go was strategically deep. They started studying Go with Yasugoro Kitabatake, a Japanese student, and after two years were able to beat him with no handicap.

Kitabatake arranged a game for Edward, Emanuel, and Emanuel&#x27;s brother Berthold, against a visiting Japanese mathematician, and strong Go player. The Laskers took a nine-stone handicap, and played in consultation with each other, considering their moves deeply, but their opponent beat them effortlessly and without taking much time to think. After the game, Emanuel suggested to Edward that they travel to Tokyo to study Go. In 1911, Edward got a job at AEG. After a year at the company, he tried to get transferred to the Tokyo office, but as the company only posted fluent English speakers in Tokyo, he went to work in England first.

Edward was detained there during the early part of World War I and never made it to Tokyo. He was, however, given permission to travel to the United States by Sir William Haldane-Porter, who was head of what would become the UK Immigration Service. Haldane-Porter remembered that Lasker had won the London chess championship in May 1914 and he had personally witnessed Edward&#x27;s famous game against George Alan Thomas that same year. Edward Lasker was instrumental in developing Go in the U.S., and together with Karl Davis Robinson and Lee Hartman founded the American Go Association.

In 1971, Nihon Ki-in awarded him the Okura Prize for international promotion of Go.

==Personal life==
Lasker lived in New York City until his death in 1981. He was friends with former World Champion Emanuel Lasker. Edward wrote in his memoirs of the New York 1924 tournament as published in the March 1974 edition of &quot;Chess Life&quot; magazine: &quot;I did not discover that we were actually related until he (Emanuel Lasker) told me shortly before his death that someone had shown him a Lasker family tree on one of whose branches I was dangling.&quot; 

In a February 8, 1973, letter to Robert B. Long, Lasker explained their exact relationship:The genealogy, incidentally, indicates that the common forbear of Emanuel and myself was the son Samuel Lasker of the Rabbi of the Polish village Łask, whose name was originally Meier Hindels.

However, later the additional name Lasker was given to him to distinguish him from another Meier Hindels also living in Lask. Samuel Lasker moved to another Polish village, Kępno, in 1769, after it had been captured by Frederick the Great and became a German township, and I am the last descendant of his who was born there. He was the great-grandfather of my great-grandfather. His first-born son left Kepmen [&quot;sic&quot;-Kempen] and moved to Jarotschin, another Polish village, and Emanuel Lasker was that one&#x27;s greatgrandson. If true, this made Edward and Emanuel third cousins twice removed.

Lasker was the uncle of the cellist and Holocaust survivor Anita Lasker-Wallfisch; her father Alfons was Edward Lasker&#x27;s brother.

<text>Marattiaceae is the only family of extant (living) ferns in the order Marattiales. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Marattiales is the only order in the subclass Marattiidae. The family has six genera and about 110 species. Many are different in appearance from other ferns, having large fronds and fleshy rootstocks.

==Description==
The Marattiaceae diverged from other ferns very early in their evolutionary history and are quite different from many plants familiar to people in temperate zones. Many of them have massive, fleshy rootstocks and the largest known fronds of any fern. The Marattiaceae is one of two groups of ferns traditionally known as eusporangiate ferns, meaning that the sporangium is formed from a group of cells as opposed to a leptosporangium in which there is a single initial cell. At least two genera, &quot;Angiopteris&quot; and &quot;Marattia&quot;, have been reported to undergo monoplastidic meiosis rather than polyplastidic meiosis, and are the only known examples within euphyllophytes to do so.

The large fronds characteristic of the group are most readily found in the genus &quot;Angiopteris&quot;, native to Australasia, Madagascar and Oceania. These fronds may be up to 9 meters long in the species &quot;Angiopteris teysmanniana&quot; of Java. In the Hawaiian Islands, Costa Rica, and Jamaica, the species &quot;Angiopteris evecta&quot; is naturalized, having escaped from botanical gardens, and is considered an invasive species. &quot;Angiopteris&quot; is unique among ferns in having explosively dispersed spores, which may contribute to its ability to spread.

&quot;Marattia&quot; in the strict sense is found in the neotropics and Hawaii with six recognized species. The genus &quot;Eupodium&quot; is also neotropical, with three species, and was originally described for the distinctive stalked synangia of some species.

&quot;Ptisana&quot; is a paleotropical genus, formerly thought to be part of &quot;Marattia&quot;. These plants are 2-4 times pinnate, with fronds often comparable in size to those found in &quot;Angiopteris&quot;. Terminal segments usually have a prominent suture where they attach. The sporangia lack the labiate apertures of &quot;Marattia&quot; and &quot;Eupodium&quot;, and synangia are deeply cut. The name of the genus derives from the resemblance of the synangia to pearl barley. The king fern, &quot;Ptisana salicina&quot;, from New Zealand and the South Pacific and known in Māori as &quot;para&quot; now has been placed in this genus. Sometimes called the potato fern, this is a large fern with an edible fleshy rhizome that is used as a food source by some indigenous peoples.

The East-Asian genus &quot;Christensenia&quot; is named in honor of the Danish pteridologist Carl Christensen is an uncommon fern with distinctive fronds resembling a horse chestnut leaf, hence the species &quot;Christensenia aesculifolia&quot;, meaning horse-chestnut-leaved &quot;Christensenia&quot;. Despite the relatively diminutive size of plants in this genus, the stomata of &quot;Christensenia&quot; are the largest known in the plant kingdom.

The genus &quot;Danaea&quot; is endemic to the Neotropics. They have bipinnate leaves with opposite pinnae, which are dimorphic, the fertile leaves much contracted, and covered below with sunken, linear synangia dehiscing via pores.

==Taxonomy==
in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), Marattiaceae is the only family in the order Marattiales, which in turn is the only order in the subclass Marattiidae. Marattiidae is one of four subclasses of class Polypodiopsida (ferns), to which it is related as shown in this cladogram, being a sister group to Polypodiidae.
===History of classification===
In the molecular phylogenetic classification of Smith et al. in 2006, the Marattiales formed the single member of the class Marattiopsida. Four genera were recognized. The class was lowered in rank to the subclass Marattiidae in the 2009 classification of Mark W. Chase and James L. Reveal, and subsequent systems such as Christenhusz et al. (2011). The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (2016) classification retains this rank. In that system, Marattiidae is monotypic and has one order, Marattiales, one family, Marattiaceae, six genera, and an estimated 111 species.

There have long been four traditional extant genera (&quot;Angiopteris&quot;, &quot;Christensenia&quot;, &quot;Danaea&quot; and &quot;Marattia&quot;), but phylogenetic analysis has determined the genus &quot;Marattia&quot; to be paraphyletic, and the genus has been split into three genera, &quot;Marattia&quot; in the strict sense, &quot;Eupodium&quot;, and &quot;Ptisana&quot;. Christenhusz and Chase placed &quot;Danaea&quot; in subfamily Danaeoideae and the remaining genera in subfamily Marattioideae, but this subfamilial classification was not taken up by PPG I.

This fern group has a long fossil history with many extinct taxa (&quot;Psaronius&quot;, &quot;Asterotheca&quot;, &quot;Scolecopteris&quot;, &quot;Eoangiopteris&quot;, &quot;Qasimia&quot;, &quot;Marantoidea&quot;, &quot;Danaeites&quot;, &quot;Marattiopsis&quot;, &quot;Ptychocarpus&quot;, etc.).

===Genera===
Six genera are accepted in the PPG I classification:
*&quot;Angiopteris&quot; 
*&quot;Christensenia&quot; 
*&quot;Danaea&quot; 
*&quot;Eupodium&quot; 
*&quot;Marattia&quot; 
*&quot;Ptisana&quot; 
Several other genera have been named in the Marattiaceae, namely: &quot;Archangiopteris&quot;, &quot;Clementea&quot;, &quot;Macroglossum&quot;, &quot;Protangiopteris&quot;, &quot;Protomarattia&quot; and &quot;Psilodochea&quot;. These are currently treated as synonyms of &quot;Angiopteris&quot;.

== Evolutionary history ==
Marattiaceae are considered one of the most primitive living lineages of ferns. The earliest members of the family appeared during the Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago. The group has an extensive fossil record extending from the Carboniferous into the Jurassic, but post-Jurassic records are scarce.

<text>Edward Clement Davies (19 February 1884 – 23 March 1962) was a Welsh politician and leader of the Liberal Party from 1945 to 1956.

==Early life and education==
Edward Clement Davies was born on 19 February 1884 in Llanfyllin, Montgomeryshire, Wales. He was educated at the local primary school and at Llanfyllin County School, to which he won a scholarship in 1897. He read law at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours.

==Legal practice==
Davies lectured in law at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1908–1909 and was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He practiced as a barrister in North Wales and in northern England before moving to London in 1910, where he established a successful legal practice. During the First World War he worked for the Board of Trade. He took silk in 1926, becoming a KC.

==Early political career==
Davies was elected to the House of Commons in the 1929 General Election as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Montgomeryshire. From 1929 until 1931 he supported David Lloyd George&#x27;s leadership of the party. In 1931, the Liberals divided into three groups and he became one of the Liberal National MPs supporting the National Government. He came under increasing pressure from his local Liberal executive and also his predecessor as MP Lord Davies who was President of Montgomeryshire Liberal Association, to move into opposition. In 1939 he resigned from both the Liberal Nationals and the National Government whip. In 1940, he was chairman of the All Party Action Group that played a significant role in forcing the resignation of the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain.

==Leader of the Liberal Party==
In 1942, he rejoined the Liberal Party, becoming a prominent figure in the Radical Action group, which called for the party to withdraw from the war-time electoral pact and adopt more radical policies. Indeed, at his adoption meeting in June 1945 he declared that &quot;Members of the Labour Party and myself can walk side by side for a long way. There are many things on which we can agree.&quot; Despite the fact that he had been absent from the party for a decade, with lingering suspicions that his commitment to Liberalism was less than full, he became leader of the Liberal Party in 1945 after Archibald Sinclair surprisingly lost his seat in the electoral debacle of that year that reduced the Liberals to just 12 seats in the House of Commons.

Davies had not sought the position of leader and was not enthusiastic about it. However, with only 12 MPs, 6 of whom were only newly elected that year, the party&#x27;s choice was somewhat limited. It was widely expected and generally hoped (probably even by Davies himself), that he would be only a &#x27;caretaker&#x27; leader until the more dynamic and popular Sinclair could get back into the House of Commons. Since that never happened, Davies, was in fact to remain party leader for the next 11 years, taking the Liberals through three general elections.

Davies was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the London Welsh Centre, Gray&#x27;s Inn Road, from 1946 until 1947. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1947.

His first general election as party leader, in 1950, reduced the party to 9 MPs with barely 9% of the vote. In those of 1951 and 1955, the Liberals fell back even further, holding only 6 seats, with 2.5% and 2.7% of the vote respectively (although these vote shares were largely attributed to the huge drop in the number of seats the party fought). He finally resigned as leader at the party conference in September 1956 and was succeeded by the much younger and more vigorous Jo Grimond, following what was effectively a coup by the membership against the executive; both Davies and Grimond appeared to be unaware of the coup until it was over.

Davies therefore led the Liberal Party, which, in the late 19th and early 20th century had been a major force in British politics and a frequent party of government, through its lowest period, when it was reduced to a minor party: the result of the electorate&#x27;s polarisation between the Labour and the Conservatives. The cliché &quot;A Liberal vote is a wasted vote&quot; argument never held truer than in the 1950s. He was personally well-liked, both in the party and beyond it. The general view of him was that of a personally decent man who did his best in a position to which neither taste nor temperament fitted him.

Davies was an alcoholic for decades, which left him in a weakened state of health, particularly by the time he took on the burden of party leadership. For two of his three general election campaigns as leader, for example, he was hospitalised. Also, despite the general affection in which he was held, his leadership was widely regarded as lacklustre and ineffective, thus contributing to the party&#x27;s malaise at a time when it was most in need of direction.

In recent years, however, his role has been revised and treated more sympathetically. Historians now point out that with the Cold War tensions of the late 1940s and early 1950s in particular, leading the Liberal Party then would have been a challenge for anybody, and just by keeping the party together and in existence at all, Davies made a significant contribution. It has also emerged that he was offered cabinet office (Education Minister) in 1951 by Prime Minister Winston Churchill in exchange for supporting the new Conservative government but refused on the grounds that it would have destroyed the Liberal Party.

Clement Davies died in 1962, at the age of 78. Though still an MP, he was by then largely detached from the affairs of the Liberal party and acted semi-independently. He was succeeded as Liberal MP for Montgomeryshire by Emlyn Hooson.

==Personal life==

Numerous personal tragedies darkened his life. He lost three of his four children within the space of a few years after the outbreak of the Second World War. His oldest son, David, died in 1939 as a result of natural causes related to epilepsy, and his daughter Mary (a servicewoman with the ATS) committed suicide in 1941 and another son, Geraint, was killed on active service in the Welsh Guards in 1942. Each of his children died at the age of 24, except for Davies&#x27; fourth child, Stanley, who survived until old age.

<text>Re: Colonised Planet 5, Shikasta (often shortened to Shikasta) is a 1979 science fiction novel by Doris Lessing, and is the first book in her five-book &quot;Canopus in Argos&quot; series. It was first published in the United States in December 1980 by Alfred A. Knopf, and in the United Kingdom in November 1979 by Jonathan Cape. Shikasta is also the name of the fictional planet featured in the novel.

Subtitled &quot;Personal, psychological, historical documents relating to visit by Johor (George Sherban) Emissary (Grade 9) 87th of the Period of the Last Days&quot;, &quot;Shikasta&quot; is the history of the planet Shikasta (whose inhabitants call it Earth) under the influence of three galactic empires, Canopus, Sirius, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The book is presented in the form of a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to Shikasta who document the planet&#x27;s prehistory, its degeneration leading to the &quot;Century of Destruction&quot; (the 20th century), and the Apocalypse (World War III).

&quot;Shikasta&quot; draws on the Old Testament and is influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism, an Islamic belief system in which Lessing had taken an interest in the mid-1960s. The book represented a major shift of focus in Lessing&#x27;s writing, from realism to science fiction, and this disappointed many of her readers. It received mixed reviews from critics. Some were impressed by the scope and vision of the book, with one reviewer calling it &quot;an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world&#x27;s great living writers&quot;. Others were critical of the novel&#x27;s bleakness, that humanity has no free will and that their fate lies in the hands of galactic empires.

The story of Shikasta is retold in the third book of the &quot;Canopus&quot; series, &quot;The Sirian Experiments&quot; (1980), this time from the point of view of Sirius. Shikasta reappears in the fourth book in the series, &quot;The Making of the Representative for Planet 8&quot; (1982), and the Zones, briefly mentioned in &quot;Shikasta&quot;, are the subject of the second book in the series, &quot;The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five&quot; (1980).

==Plot summary==
Canopus, a benevolent galactic empire centred at Canopus in the constellation Argo Navis, colonises a young and promising planet they name Rohanda (the fruitful). They nurture its burgeoning humanoids and accelerate their evolution. When the Natives are ready, Canopus imposes a &quot;Lock&quot; on Rohanda that links it via &quot;astral currents&quot; to the harmony and strength of the Canopean Empire. In addition to Canopus, two other empires also establish a presence on the planet: their ally, Sirius from the star of the same name, and their mutual enemy, Puttiora. The Sirians confine their activities largely to genetic experiments on the southern continents during Rohanda&#x27;s prehistory (described in Lessing&#x27;s third book in the &quot;Canopus&quot; series, &quot;The Sirian Experiments&quot;), while the Shammat of Puttiora remain dormant, waiting for opportunities to strike.

For many millennia the Natives of Rohanda prosper in a Canopean induced climate of peaceful coexistence and accelerated development. Then an unforeseen &quot;cosmic re-alignment&quot; puts Rohanda out of phase with Canopus which causes the Lock to break. Deprived of Canopus&#x27;s resources and a steady stream of a substance called SOWF (substance-of-we-feeling), the Natives develop a &quot;Degenerative Disease&quot; that puts the goals of the individual ahead of those of the community. The Shammat exploit this disturbance and begin undermining Canopus&#x27;s influence by infecting the Natives with their evil ways. As Rohanda degenerates into greed and conflict, the Canopeans reluctantly change its name to Shikasta (the stricken). Later in the book, Shikasta is identified as Earth.

In an attempt to salvage Canopus&#x27;s plans for Shikasta and correct the Natives&#x27; decline, Canopean emissaries are sent to the planet. Johor is one such emissary, who takes on the form of a Native and begins identifying those individuals who have not degenerated too far and are amenable to his corrective instructions. Johor then sends those he has successfully &quot;converted&quot; to spread the word among other Natives, and soon isolated communities begin to return to the pre-Shikastan days. But without the SOWF, Canopus is fighting a losing battle against Shammat&#x27;s influence over the Natives and the planet declines further. By the Shikastan&#x27;s 20th century, the planet has degenerated into war and self-destruction. Johor returns, but this time through Zone 6 from which he is born on the planet (incarnated) as a Shikastan, George Sherban. As Sherban grows up, he establishes contact with other Canopeans in disguise and then resumes his work trying to help the Shikastans. But famine and unemployment grow, and anarchy spreads.

On the eve of World War III, Sherban and other emissaries relocate a small number of promising Shikastans to remote locations to escape the coming nuclear holocaust. He also takes part in the trial of all Europeans for the crimes of colonialism. Europe has been conquered by China, but he persuades people that Europe was not the only offender.

The war reduces Shikasta&#x27;s population by 99% and sweeps the planet clean of the &quot;barbarians&quot;. The Shammat, who set the Shikastans on a course of self-destruction, self-destruct themselves and withdraw from the planet. The Canopeans help the survivors rebuild their lives and re-align themselves with Canopus. With a strengthened Lock and the SOWF flowing freely again, harmony and prosperity return to Shikasta.

==Background and genre==

In the mid-1960s Lessing had become interested in Sufism, an Islamic belief system, after reading &quot;The Sufis&quot; by Idries Shah. She described &quot;The Sufis&quot; as &quot;the most surprising book [she] had read&quot;, and said it &quot;changed [her] life&quot;. Lessing later met Shah, who became &quot;a good friend [and] teacher&quot;. In the early 1970s Lessing began writing &quot;inner space&quot; fiction, which included the novels &quot;Briefing for a Descent into Hell&quot; (1971) and &quot;Memoirs of a Survivor&quot; (1974). In the late 1970s she wrote &quot;Shikasta&quot; in which she used many Sufi concepts.

&quot;Shikasta&quot; was intended to be a &quot;single self-contained book&quot;, but as Lessing&#x27;s fictional universe developed, she found she had ideas for more than just one book, and ended up writing a series of five. &quot;Shikasta&quot;, and the &quot;Canopus in Argos&quot; series as a whole, fall into the category of soft science fiction (&quot;space fiction&quot; in Lessing&#x27;s own words) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. Robert Alter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre literary critic Northrop Frye called the &quot;anatomy&quot;, which is &quot;a combination of fantasy and morality&quot;. Gore Vidal placed Lessing&#x27;s &quot;science fiction&quot; &quot;somewhere between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard&quot;.
&quot;Shikasta&quot; represented a major shift of focus for Lessing, influenced by spiritual and mystical themes in Sufism. This switch to &quot;science fiction&quot; was not well received by readers and critics. By the late 1970s, Lessing was considered &quot;one of the most honest, intelligent and engaged writers of the day&quot;, and Western readers unfamiliar with Sufism were dismayed that Lessing had abandoned her &quot;rational worldview&quot;. George Stade of &quot;The New York Times&quot; complained that &quot;our Grand Mistress of lumpen realism has gone religious on us&quot;. The reaction of reviewers and readers to the first two books in the series, &quot;Shikasta&quot; and &quot;The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five&quot; (1980), prompted Lessing to write in the Preface to the third book in the series, &quot;The Sirian Experiments&quot; (1980):

Further criticism of the &quot;Canopus&quot; series followed, which included this comment by &quot;New York Times&quot; critic John Leonard: &quot;One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs. Lessing ... She now propagandizes on behalf of our insignificance in the cosmic razzmatazz.&quot; Lessing replied by saying: &quot;What they didn&#x27;t realize was that in science fiction is some of the best social fiction of our time. I also admire the classic sort of science fiction, like &quot;Blood Music&quot;, by Greg Bear. He&#x27;s a great writer.&quot; Lessing said in 1983 that she would like to write stories about red and white dwarfs, space rockets powered by anti-gravity, and charmed and coloured quarks, &quot;[b]ut we can&#x27;t all be physicists&quot;.

Lessing later wrote several essays on Sufism which were published in her essay collection, &quot;Time Bites&quot; (2004). She was awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize in Literature, and was described by the Swedish Academy as &quot;that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny&quot;.

Lessing dedicated &quot;Shikasta&quot; to her father. While she was still a child in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) he often used to gaze up at the night sky and say, &quot;Makes you think – there are so many worlds up there, wouldn&#x27;t really matter if we did blow ourselves up – plenty more where we came from.&quot; &quot;Shikasta&quot; gave rise to a religious cult in America. Lessing said in an interview that its followers had written to her and asked, &quot;When are we going to be visited by the gods?&quot;, and she told them that the book is &quot;not a cosmology. It&#x27;s an invention&quot;, and they replied, &quot;Ah, you&#x27;re just testing us&quot;.

==Analysis==

The name &quot;Shikasta&quot; comes from the Persian word (&quot;shikastah, shekasteh&quot;) meaning &quot;broken&quot;, and is often seen used as the name of the Iranian national style of Persian calligraphy, Shekasteh Nastaʿlīq. In the book, Lessing does not state explicitly that the planet Shikasta is Earth, but many critics believe that its similarities to Earth&#x27;s history make it clear that Shikasta &quot;is&quot; Earth as seen by the Canopeans. Some of the documents in the book written by Shikastans refer to geographical locations and countries on Earth. Other critics, however, interpret Shikasta as an allegorical Earth with parallel histories that deviate from time to time.

&quot;Shikasta&quot; has been called an &quot;anti-novel&quot;, and an &quot;architectonic novel&quot;. It is the story of the planet Shikasta from the perspective of Canopus and is presented as a case study for &quot;first-year students of Canopean Colonial Rule&quot;. It contains a series of reports by Canopean emissaries to the planet, extracts from the Canopean reference, &quot;History of Shikasta&quot;, and copies of letters and journals written by selected Shikastans. The history of Shikasta is monitored by the virtually immortal Canopeans, from Rohanda&#x27;s prehistory, through to Shikasta&#x27;s &quot;Century of Destruction&quot; (Earth&#x27;s 20th century), and into Earth&#x27;s future when the Chinese occupy Europe and World War III breaks out. The book purports to be the &quot;true&quot; history of our planet.

&quot;Shikasta&quot; alludes to the Old Testament, Gnosticism and Sufism, and draws on several Judeo-Christian themes. Lessing wrote in the book&#x27;s preface that it has its roots in the Old Testament. Her SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), the &quot;spiritual nourishment&quot; that flows from Canopus to Shikasta, is also a word she invented with a pronunciation similar to &quot;Sufi&quot;. A reviewer of the book in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;Shikasta&quot; is a &quot;reworking of the Bible&quot;, and the Infinity Plus website draws parallels between the Canopeans and their emissaries, and God and his angels from the Old Testament. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer wrote that the &quot;outer space&quot; where the Canopeans come from is a metaphor for &quot;religious or inner space&quot;. Thelma J. Shinn, in her book &quot;Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women&quot;, described the struggle between Canopus and Shammat, played out on Shikasta, as the &quot;eternal struggle between good and evil&quot;, and the &quot;Degenerative Disease&quot; that strikes Shikasta as a metaphor for the original sin. Lessing said in an interview that the final war (World War III) at the end of the novel is the Apocalypse. Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis wrote in &quot;The Journal of Baháʼí Studies&quot; that &quot;Shikasta&quot; is the &quot;symbolic rendering of the coming of a new prophet to an earthlike planet&quot;, and relates it to principles of the Baháʼí Faith.

==Reception==
Paul Gray wrote in a review in &quot;Time&quot; that the documents that make up &quot;Shikasta&quot; allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective &quot;dramatically from the near infinite to the minute&quot;. He said that the book&#x27;s cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her &quot;grand designs&quot; and &quot;configurations of enormous powers&quot; with &quot;passages of aching poignancy&quot;. Gray said that &quot;Shikasta&quot; is closer to &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and the Old Testament than it is to Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her &quot;space fiction&quot; as &quot;science fiction&quot;. He found Lessing&#x27;s bleak vision of Earth&#x27;s history in which she suggests that humans &quot;could not ... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos&quot;, a little &quot;unsatisfying&quot;, but added that even if you do not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, &quot;even furiously engaging on every page&quot;. Gray called &quot;Shikasta&quot; &quot;an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world&#x27;s great living writers&quot;.

Author Gore Vidal wrote in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; that &quot;Shikasta&quot; is a &quot;work of a formidable imagination&quot;. He said that Lessing is &quot;a master&quot; of eschatological writing, but added that while her depictions of a terminal London are &quot;very real&quot;, as a whole the book is &quot;never quite real enough&quot;. Vidal also felt that Zone 6, Lessing&#x27;s alternate plane for the dead, is not as convincing as The Dry Lands in Ursula K. Le Guin’s &quot;Earthsea trilogy&quot;. He compared the Canopeans and Shammat to Milton&#x27;s God and Satan in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, but said that while Lucifer&#x27;s &quot;overthrow ... of his writerly creator is an awesome thing&quot;, in &quot;Shikasta&quot; Lessing&#x27;s human race with no free will is too passive and of no interest. Vidal attributed this to Lessing&#x27;s &quot;surrender&quot; to the Sufis and the SOWF (Substance-Of-We-Feeling), and not her inability to create good characters.

&quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer George Stade said that &quot;Shikasta&quot; &quot;forces us to think about ... what we are, how we got that way and where we are going&quot;, but complained that the book is filled with &quot;false hopes&quot;, and that the fate of humankind relies on &quot;theosophical emanations, cosmic influences, occult powers, spiritual visitations and stellar vibrations&quot;. When the SOWF is cut off and the Shikastans degenerate, Lessing &quot;both indicts and exculpates&quot; them, implying that humanity is bad, but it is not their fault. While Stade complimented Lessing on the book&#x27;s satire, and her depictions of Zone 6, which he said &quot;have the eerie beauty of ancient Gnostic texts&quot;, he &quot;disapprove[d]&quot; of the novel as a whole, but added, &quot;that doesn&#x27;t mean I didn&#x27;t enjoy reading it&quot;.

Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. M. G. Lord called &quot;Shikasta&quot; an &quot;epic&quot; and suspected that it may have influenced the Nobel committee when they referred to Lessing as an &quot;epicist of the female experience&quot;. Thelma J. Shinn wrote in her book, &quot;Worlds Within Women: Myth and Mythmaking in Fantastic Literature by Women&quot;, that Lessing&#x27;s history of humanity in &quot;Shikasta&quot; is &quot;pessimistic&quot; but &quot;convincing&quot;. &quot;Infinity Plus&quot; described &quot;Shikasta&quot; as a &quot;mainstream novel that uses SF ideas&quot;, and said that while Lessing was not able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union and the impact of computers, the novel &quot;barely seems dated&quot; because of her &quot;cunningly non-specific&quot; approach.

James Schellenberg writing in &quot;Challenging Destiny&quot;, a Canadian science fiction and fantasy magazine, was impressed by &quot;Shikasta&quot; &quot;grand sense of perspective&quot; and the context of humanity set in a &quot;vaster scale of civilization and right-thinking&quot;. He liked the concept of SOWF as a &quot;metaphor of community connectedness&quot;, but felt it was an unusual way to build a utopia. The book&#x27;s fractured storytelling leads to Lessing breaking the &quot;famous dictum of writing – show, don&#x27;t tell&quot;, and while that may work in certain circumstances, Schellenberg felt that that approach does not work very well in &quot;Shikasta&quot;. The online magazine &quot;Journey to the Sea&quot; found Lessing&#x27;s inclusion of stories from the Hebrew Bible &quot;entertaining and intriguing&quot;, and said she challenges the logical thinker&#x27;s rejection of these sacred texts, suggesting that it is &quot;imaginatively possible&quot; that they could be true.

Following Lessing&#x27;s death in 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; put &quot;Shikasta&quot; in their list of the top five Lessing books.

<doc id="519950" wikidata="Q2275927" url="?curid=519950" title="Regioselectivity">
<text>In organic chemistry, regioselectivity is the preference of chemical bonding or breaking in one direction over all other possible directions. It can often apply to which of many possible positions a reagent will affect, such as which proton a strong base will abstract from an organic molecule, or where on a substituted benzene ring a further substituent will be added.

A specific example is a halohydrin formation reaction with 2-propenylbenzene:

Because of the preference for the formation of one product over another, the reaction is selective. This reaction is regioselective because it selectively generates one constitutional isomer rather than the other.

Various examples of regioselectivity have been formulated as rules for certain classes of compounds under certain conditions, many of which are named. Among the first introduced to chemistry students are Markovnikov&#x27;s rule for the addition of protic acids to alkenes, and the Fürst-Plattner rule for the addition of nucleophiles to derivatives of cyclohexene, especially epoxide derivatives.

Regioselectivity in ring-closure reactions is subject to Baldwin&#x27;s rules. If there are two or more orientations that can be generated during a reaction, one of them is dominant (e.g., Markovnikov/anti-Markovnikov addition across a double bond)

Regioselectivity can also be applied to specific reactions such as addition to pi ligands.

Selectivity also occurs in carbene insertions, for example in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction. In this reaction, an oxygen is regioselectively inserted near an adjacent carbonyl group. In ketones, this insertion is directed toward the carbon which is more highly substituted (i.e. according to Markovnikov&#x27;s rule). For example, in a study involving acetophenones, this oxygen was preferentially inserted between the carbonyl and the aromatic ring to give acetyl aromatic esters instead of methyl benzoates.

<doc id="519955" wikidata="Q3366191" url="?curid=519955" title="Parti canadien">
<text>The &#x27; () or &#x27; () was a primarily francophone political party in what is now Quebec founded by members of the liberal elite of Lower Canada at the beginning of the 19th century. Its members were made up of liberal professionals and small-scale merchants, including François Blanchet, Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, John Neilson, Jean-Thomas Taschereau, James Stuart, Louis Bourdages, Denis-Benjamin Viger, Daniel Tracey, Edmund Bailey O&#x27;Callaghan, Andrew Stuart and Louis-Joseph Papineau.

== Creation ==
The British Government established two oligarchic governments, or councils, to rule what is today Quebec and Ontario, then called Lower and Upper Canada. Upper Canada was ruled by the Family Compact and Lower Canada by the Chateau Clique. Both groups exerted monopolistic, uncontested rule over economic and political life. The councils were corrupt in their nature by strengthening their dominance by personal use of funds which eventually led to infrastructural problems around Upper and Lower Canada, including land distribution, poor road conditions, and lack of education funding.

Continuous frustration between the councils and the legislative assemblies over language differences and Lower Canada&#x27;s discontent for treatment of French problems led to the beginning of the Parti Canadien.
English merchants and politicians in Canada pushed for an assemblage of the Canada&#x27;s, which would lead to the assimilation of the French. Louis-Joseph Papineau rallied the people of Lower Canada to sign a petition against the proposition. Papineau later sailed to Britain to present the petition to the British Government and to rally for the rights of the people of Lower Canada, only to have the issue heard with little action to follow. Later, the British Parliament passed the Canada Land and Tenures Act which abolished the feudal and seigneurial systems in British North America. The act left property rights of many land owners in limbo and created much confusion and conflict in Lower Canada where the French Civil Code was in action, and thus infuriating the French people of Lower Canada even more. In July 1830, word of a liberal revolution in France sparked the youth of Lower Canada as liberalism was non-existent in Canada at the time. Upper and Lower Canada governments tried and failed to resolve the recent uprising and tension, even further-distancing the French people of Lower Canada from the English of Upper Canada.

== History ==
Under the leadership of Pierre-Stanislas Bédard, the party campaigned for ministerial responsibility and a responsible government in which the members of the Legislative Council of Lower Canada would be appointed by the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s majority party. Although the party controlled the assembly in Lower Canada, at that time the council, which held most of the power, was chosen by an appointed British governor, whom the considered to be seriously corrupt and hostile to the interests of the majority of the population.

In 1806, the imitated its political adversaries, the Tory Château Clique, in founding a newspaper named &quot;Le Canadien&quot;. In 1810, Governor Craig had Bédard and some of his colleagues at the newspaper arrested and imprisoned without trial for a comment published in &quot;Le Canadien&quot;.

In 1811, James Stuart became leader of the in the assembly and, in 1815, reformer Louis-Joseph Papineau was elected Assembly Speaker. Papineau&#x27;s reformist ideas gained in authority and popularity as he led the party in its fight against the union of the Canada&#x27;s proposal in 1822, until the suspension of the Constitutional Act in 1837.

== Parti Patriote ==
In 1826, the party took the name of Parti Patriote, reflecting a much stronger sense of French-Canadian nationalism and a change of strategy. The Patriotes largely favoured agriculture over commercialism and blocked many economic projects led by their adversaries. The party succeeded in delaying development of British capitalism within the colony. However, their positions were often seen as unclear. The party&#x27;s new strategy was considered too radical even by some of its members, most notably John Neilson, who eventually left the party in 1830.

In 1834, Papineau and the Parti Patriote created the Ninety-Two Resolutions; an extensive list of demands for political reform which was sent to the British government. The British government ignored the resolutions for over three years until in 1837 it countered the Parti Patriote&#x27;s requests with ten resolutions of its own, called the Russel Resolutions, while rejecting all proposed ninety-two resolutions made by Papineau and his party. These resolutions allowed the colony governor to obtain budgetary estimates without vote of the assembly, which brought about verbal and physical violence, and eventually led to the Rebellions of 1837. After the rebellions, many patriotes were exiled, hanged, or had their houses set ablaze, which marked the end of the party. However many party members became active members in politics of the new Province of Canada.

<text>Howard Jay Phillips (February 3, 1941 – April 20, 2013) was an American politician and activist. A political conservative, Phillips was a United States presidential candidate who served as the chairman of The Conservative Caucus, a conservative public policy advocacy group which he founded in 1974. Phillips was a founding member of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, which later became known as the Constitution Party.

==Personal life==
Phillips was born into a Jewish family in Boston in 1941, Phillips converted to evangelical Christianity as an adult in the 1970s and was subsequently associated with Christian Reconstructionism.

A 1962 graduate of Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he was twice elected chairman of the Student Council, and was lauded by &quot;The Cross and the Flag,&quot; a Ku Klux Klan magazine, for his &quot;patriotic&quot; ideological bent. Phillips publicly and immediately disavowed the Klan. Phillips was also president of Policy Analysis, Inc., a public policy research organization which publishes the bimonthly &quot;Issues and Strategy Bulletin&quot;.

Phillips resided in Fairfax County, Virginia in the Washington, D.C., suburbs with his wife, the former Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Blanchard.

==Republican years==
During the Nixon Administration, Phillips headed two federal agencies, ending his Executive Branch career as director of the U.S. Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the Executive Office of the President for five months in 1973, a position from which he resigned when U.S. President Richard M. Nixon reneged on his commitment to veto further funding for Great Society programs begun in the administration of Nixon&#x27;s predecessor, Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson.

Nixon&#x27;s appointment of Phillips as Acting Director of OEO in January 1973 touched off a national controversy culminating in a court case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (&quot;Williams v. Phillips&quot;, 482 F.2d 669) challenging the legality of Phillips&#x27; appointment, since the statute establishing the office did not specifically establish a presidential right to make an interim appointment (one not confirmed by the Senate) under the existing circumstances. The Court ruled (and the 2nd Circuit subsequently affirmed) that the President had no right to make the interim appointment and voided it, declaring his time in it to have been illegal.

==Formation of the Conservative Caucus==

Phillips left the Republican Party in 1974 after some two decades of service to the GOP as precinct worker, election warden, campaign manager, congressional aide, Boston municipal Republican chairman, and assistant to the chairman of the Republican National Committee. In 1970, he was the Republican nominee for Massachusetts&#x27;s 6th congressional district. In 1978, Phillips finished fourth in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.

In 1974, Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus, a nationwide, grass-roots public policy advocacy group. The group opposed the 1978 Panama Canal treaties and the Jimmy Carter-Leonid Brezhnev SALT II treaties in 1979, supported the Strategic Defense Initiative and major tax reductions during the 1980s, and fought to end Federal subsidies to activist groups under the banner of &quot;defunding the Left.&quot;

The fight against Baker was not Phillips&#x27; first clash with Reagan. In 1981, he had joined other conservatives, including the Reverend Jerry Falwell, in opposing the nomination of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor to the United States Supreme Court. According to Phillips, &quot;People say you can&#x27;t tell how a Supreme Court nominee will turn out once on the bench. I respectfully disagree. In most cases, it&#x27;s very clear. I opposed the nomination of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor because it was very clear that she had a pro-abortion record in the Arizona State Senate and as a judge in Arizona. She was also allied with Planned Parenthood.&quot; In 1990, Phillips opposed the first President Bush&#x27;s nomination of David Souter of New Hampshire to the high court. Phillips said that he opposed Souter because &quot;I read his senior thesis at Harvard in which he said he was a legal positivist and one of his heroes was Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and that he rejected all higher law theories, such as those spelled out in our Declaration of Independence. In addition, he was a trustee of two hospitals: Dartmouth Hitchcock and Concord Memorial. He successfully changed the policy of those two hospitals from zero abortion to convenience abortion.&quot;

Other Conservative Caucus campaigns have involved opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization, support for a national version of California&#x27;s Proposition 187 (to end mandated subsidies for illegal aliens), as well as continuing efforts to oppose publicly funded health care, abortion and gay rights. Phillips was the host of &quot;Conservative Roundtable&quot;, a weekly public affairs television program.

==Role in formation of the New Right==

Phillips played an instrumental role in the leadership of the New Right, and in the founding of the religious right in the 1970s. He worked with fellow conservatives Paul Weyrich of The Heritage Foundation and both former Christian Voice co-activists Richard Viguerie and Terry Dolan to persuade the Reverend Jerry Falwell to form the Moral Majority, and helped Judie Brown form the American Life League.

Later, Phillips continued to support the New Right by helping found the Council for National Policy with Dr. Tim LaHaye.

==U.S. Taxpayers Party/Constitution Party==
Phillips was one of the founders of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (which changed its name to the Constitution Party in 1999), a third party associated with conservative, anti-abortion issues, and constitutional government ideas on both social and fiscal issues. He was that party&#x27;s presidential candidate in the 1992, 1996 and 2000 elections for U.S. president.

===Presidential campaigns===
Phillips first campaigned for president in 1992, as an independent. He refused to support the re-election of Republican George H. W. Bush or Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. He finished in seventh place in the popular vote. The campaign received 43,369 votes for 0.04% of the total vote.

Phillips was chosen by an overwhelming majority of delegates at the National Convention of the U.S. Taxpayers Party, in San Diego, California, on August 17, 1996, to serve as its presidential candidate in the 1996 election. Phillips finished sixth, with 184,656 votes, for 0.19% of the total vote.

In the 2000 U.S presidential election, Phillips received 98,020 votes for 0.1% of the total vote and a sixth-place finish.

==Death==
Phillips died at his home in Vienna, Virginia, on April 20, 2013, at the age of 72 after a battle with frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. A private service was held on April 29, 2013 with Chuck Baldwin, the 2008 Constitution Party presidential nominee, officiating.

<doc id="519961" wikidata="Q27424" url="?curid=519961" title="Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus">
<text>Isaac Doukas Komnenos (or Ducas Comnenus, c. 1155 – 1195/1196) was a claimant to the Byzantine Empire and the ruler of Cyprus from 1185 to 1191. Contemporary sources commonly refer to him as the emperor of Cyprus. He lost the island to King Richard I of England during the Third Crusade.

==Family==

Isaac of Cyprus was a member of the royal Komnenos family. His grandfather Isaac had been bypassed by a younger brother, Manuel I Komnenos, in the succession to the Byzantine throne, instead taking the auxiliary position of &quot;sebastokrator&quot;. With his first wife Theodora Kamaterina (d. 1144) Isaac the &quot;sebastokrator&quot; had a daughter, Irene Komnene, who married one Doukas Kamateros and gave birth to Isaac of Cyprus, .

==Life==

Most of the following biography is derived from the works of Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates. Isaac was the son of an otherwise obscure Byzantine aristocrat, Doukas Kamateros, and Irene Komnene, daughter of &quot;sebastokrator&quot; Isaac Komnenos. He married an Armenian princess on Cyprus.

===Governor and prison===

Appointed governor of Isauria and the town of Tarsus by Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, Isaac started a war against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia and was captured by its soldiers. Manuel I died in 1180 and his successors did not immediately attempt to rescue Isaac, whose long imprisonment seemingly contributed to his unpleasant disposition. On account of his Armenian royal wife, he perhaps endured not too harsh terms of captivity.

In 1183, the new Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos (1183–1185) contributed to Isaac&#x27;s ransom. Constantine Makrodoukas, a loyal supporter of the emperor and uncle of Isaac, and Andronikos Doukas, a relative and childhood friend, described as a &quot;sodomite and debaucher&quot;, both made contributions and personally stood surety for the fealty of Isaac Komnenos to the Byzantine emperor. The Knights Templar, whom Niketas Choniates labels &quot;the Phreri,&quot; contributed as well, as part of their international banking functions.

===From prison to Cyprus===
In 1185, the Armenians released Isaac, clearly tired of the imperial service. He used leftover ransom money to hire a troop of mercenaries and sailed to Cyprus, where he made himself ruler with the help of falsified imperial letters ordering the local administration to obey him in everything.

Because Isaac Komnenos failed to return to imperial service, Andronikos I ordered Constantine Makrodoukas and Andronikos Doukas arrested for treason. A mob stoned them to death on 30 May 1185, incited by the courtier Stephen Hagiochristophorites. A water-oracle conducted by Hagiochristophorites had given the letter I (iota) as the initial of the succeeding emperor, leading Andronikos I to fear that Isaac would usurp the throne. A subsequent oracle ruled out this possibility, placing the start of the new reign on an imminent date that would leave Isaac no time to make the crossing from Cyprus.

Meanwhile, Isaac took many other Romans into his service. He created an independent patriarch of Cyprus, who crowned him as emperor in 1185.

Andronikos I was killed in a popular uprising at Constantinople on 12 September 1185. His successor, Isaac II Angelos, raised a fleet of 70 ships to take back Cyprus. Its commanders were John Kontostephanos and Alexios Komnenos (died 1188), a nephew once removed of the emperor. Neither man was ideally suited for this responsibility, John being of advanced age and Alexios having been blinded by order of Andronikos I.

The fleet landed in Cyprus, but after the troops had disembarked, the ships were captured by Margaritus of Brindisi, admiral of King William II of Sicily. Subsequently, Isaac or more likely Margaritus won a victory over the Byzantine troops and captured their commanders, who were carried off to Sicily. The rest of the sailors on Cyprus tried their best to survive and to fend off the enemy. &quot;Only much later did they return home, if they had not perished altogether.&quot;

===Rule of Cyprus===
From the time of his coronation, Isaac quickly started to plunder Cyprus, raping women, defiling virgins, imposing overly cruel punishments for crimes, and stealing the possessions of the citizens. &quot;Cypriots of high esteem, comparable to Job in riches now were seen begging in the streets, naked and hungry, if they were not put to the sword by this irascible tyrant.&quot; Furthermore, he despicably ordered the foot of Basil Pentakenos, his old teacher, hacked and amputated.

Niketas Choniates, clearly not very partial to Isaac, describes him as an irascible and violent man, &quot;boiling with anger like a kettle on the fire.&quot; Byzantine emperor Andronikos I Komnenos nevertheless bore responsibility for greater cruelties. A seeming league with William II of Sicily, a powerful thorn in the side of the Byzantine Empire, helped Isaac to hold the island for the duration of his reign, and he was also closely connected to Saladin, sultan of Egypt and Syria.

===Third Crusade===
Richard the Lionheart and others embarked on the Third Crusade in 1189. Early in 1191, Berengaria of Navarre, the fiancée of Richard, and Joan of England, the sister of Richard, travelled together and were shipwrecked on Cyprus; Isaac Komnenos then took them captive. In retaliation, Richard conquered the island while on his way to Tyre. Isaac is recorded shooting two arrows at Richard from horseback, which is notable because Byzantine horse archery is an obscure subject.

The English took Isaac prisoner near Cape Apostolos Andreas on the Karpass Peninsula, the northernmost tip of the island. According to tradition, as Richard had promised not to put him into irons, he kept Isaac prisoner in chains of silver. The English transferred Isaac to the Knights Hospitaller, who kept him imprisoned in Margat near Tripoli.

This was a major turning point in the history of Cyprus, leading to the foundation of the Kingdom of Cyprus which would rule the island for several centuries.

On his return to England, King Richard granted to the town of Portsmouth the coat of arms of Isaac Komnenos: &quot;a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points&quot; - in recognition of the significant involvement of soldiers, sailors, and vessels from Portsmouth in the conquest of Cyprus. This remains Portsmouth&#x27;s coat of arms up to the present.

===Imprisonment, ransom, and death===
Returning to Europe after the Third Crusade, Richard was captured by Leopold V, Duke of Austria and Styria, and imprisoned by Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, accused of murdering his cousin Conrad of Montferrat. The subsequent ransom agreement freed Isaac and his daughter into the care of Leopold V, the son of Isaac&#x27;s aunt Theodora Komnene.

Isaac then traveled to the Sultanate of Rûm, where he attempted to gain support against the new Byzantine emperor Alexios III Angelos, crowned in 1195. However his ambitions came to nothing, as he died of poisoning in 1195 or 1196.

==His daughter==

Sources do not name the daughter of Isaac but usually call her the &quot;Damsel of Cyprus&quot;. Upon the deposition of her father Isaac, she joined the court of Richard the Lionheart, and after the Third Crusade, she traveled back to England with the other ladies of his court, including Joan of England, sister of Richard, and Berengaria of Navarre, now queen consort of England. In 1194, as part of ransom agreement of King Richard, the English released the Cypriot princess into the care of Leopold of Austria, a distant relative.

Later she lived in Provence, where in 1199 she again encountered Joan, now married to Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse. After Joan&#x27;s death in early September 1199, Raymond married the princess from Cyprus, but the marriage was annulled probably in late 1202. In 1203 she married Thierry of Flanders, an illegitimate son of Count Philip I of Flanders. The couple sailed from Marseille in 1204 with a convoy of warriors who intended to join the Fourth Crusade, but on reaching Cyprus, they attempted to claim the island as inheritors of Isaac. The attempt failed, and they fled to Armenia.

<doc id="519963" wikidata="Q811449" url="?curid=519963" title="Baul">
<text>The Baul () are a group of mystic minstrels of mixed elements of Sufism and Vaishnavism from different parts of Bangladesh and the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam&#x27;s Barak Valley and Meghalaya. Bauls constitute both a syncretic religious sect of troubadours and a musical tradition. Bauls are a very heterogeneous group, with many sects, but their membership mainly consists of Vaishnava Hindus and Sufi Muslims. They can often be identified by their distinctive clothes and musical instruments. Lalon Shah is regarded as the most celebrated Baul saint in history.

Although Bauls constitute only a small fraction of the Bengali population, their influence on the culture of Bengal is considerable. In 2005, the &quot;Baul tradition of Bangladesh&quot; was included in the list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;Baul&quot; is debated. A common view is that it may be derived either from the Sanskrit word &quot;vātula&quot;, which means &quot;mad, crazy&quot;, or from &quot;vyākula&quot;, which means &quot;impatiently eager, upset&quot;. A recent scholarly research suggests that the Bauls may be descendants of a specific branch of Sufism referred to as &quot;ba&#x27;al&quot;. According to philosopher Shashibhusan Dasgupta, both of these derivations are consistent with the modern sense of the word, &quot;inspired people with an ecstatic eagerness for a spiritual life where one can realise one&#x27;s union with the eternal Beloved&quot;. Another theory is that it comes from the Persian word &quot;Aul&quot;.

==History==
The origin of Bauls is not known exactly, but the word &quot;Baul&quot; has appeared in Bengali texts as old as the 15th century. The word is found in the &quot;Chaitanya Bhagavata&quot; of Vrindavana Dasa Thakura as well as in the &quot;Chaitanya Charitamrita&quot; of Krishnadasa Kaviraja. Some scholars maintain that it is not clear when the word took its sectarian significance, as opposed to being a synonym for the word &quot;madcap, agitated&quot;. Bauls are a part of the culture of rural Bengal. Many attempts have been made to ascertain the origin of Bauls but there is wide disagreement among scholars. But they agree that no founders have been acknowledged either by Bauls themselves or others. Bauls are divided into several named groups, each following a named Hindu or Muslim guru. Besides, there are other communities who later identified or affiliated themselves with Bauls, like &quot;Darbesi&quot;, &quot;Nera&quot; and two sub-sects of Kartabhajas — &quot;Aul&quot; and &quot;Sai&quot;. The Bauls themselves attribute their lack of historical records to their reluctance to leave traces behind. Dr. Jeanne Openshaw writes that the music of the Bauls appears to have been passed down entirely in oral form until the end of the 19th century, when it was first transcribed by outside observers.

There are two classes of Bauls: ascetic Bauls who reject family life and Bauls who live with their families. Ascetic Bauls renounce family life and society and survive on alms. They have no fixed dwelling place, but move from one to another. Bangladeshi men wear white lungis and long, white tunics; women wear white saris. They carry , shoulder bags for alms. They do not beget or rear children. They are treated as . Women dedicated to the service of ascetics, are known as &quot;service slaves&quot;. A male Baul can have one , who is associated with him in the act of devotion. Until 1976 the district of Kushtia had 252 ascetic Bauls. In 1982-83 the number rose to 905; in 2000, they numbered about 5000.

Those who choose family life, live with their spouse, children and relations in a secluded part of a village. They do not mix freely with other members of the community. Unlike ascetic Bauls, their rituals are less strict. In order to become Bauls, they recite some mystic verses and observe certain rituals.

The bauls from India dress colourfully in orange and red and have a somewhat different way of getting together. In Bangladesh, Bauls mostly dress in white which symbolises purity. There is a big yearly gathering called Jaydeb Mela, taking place in Januari in Kenduli, near Bolpur, which attract bauls and followers in large numbers.

==Concepts and practices==

Baul music celebrates celestial love, but does this in very earthy terms, as in declarations of love by the Baul for his bosh-tomi or lifemate.
With such a liberal interpretation of love, it is only natural that Baul devotional music transcends religion and some of the most famous baul composers, such as Lalon, criticised the superficiality of religious divisions:

Their religion is based on an expression of the body (&quot;deho sādhana&quot;), and an expression of the mind (&quot;mana sādhana&quot;). Some of their rituals are kept hidden from outsiders, as they might be thought to be repulsive or hedonistic. Bauls concentrate much of their mystic energies on the four body fluids, on the nine-doors (openings of the body), on prakṛiti as &quot;energy of nature&quot; or &quot;primal motive force&quot;, and on breath sādhana.

==Music==

The music of the Bauls, &quot;Baul Sangeet&quot;, is a particular type of folk song. Their music represents a long heritage of preaching mysticism through songs in Bengal.

Bauls pour out their feelings in their songs but never bother to write them down. Theirs is essentially an oral tradition. It is said that Lalon Fakir (1774 -1890), the greatest of all Bauls, continued to compose and sing songs for decades without ever stopping to correct them or put them on paper. It was only after his death that people thought of collecting and compiling his repertoire.

Their lyrics intertwine a deep sense of mysticism, a longing for oneness with the divine. An important part of their philosophy is &quot;Deha tatta&quot;, a spirituality related to the body rather than the mind. They seek the divinity in human beings. Metaphysical topics are dwelt upon humbly and in simple words. They stress remaining unattached and unconsumed by the pleasures of life even while enjoying them. To them we are all a gift of divine power and the body is a temple, music being the path to connect to that power. A consistent part of Bauls&#x27; lyrics deals with body-centered practices that aim at controlling sexual desire. The esoteric knowledge of conception and contraception is revealed in the lyrics of the songs through an enigmatic language that needs to be decoded by the guru in order to be understood and experienced.
Besides traditional motifs drawn from the rural everyday life, Baul songs have always been inclined to incorporate change and keep pace with social and economic innovations. For instance, modern Baul compositions discuss esoteric matters by using the terminology of modern, urban and technological lexicons, and it is not unusual to hear Baul refrains containing mobile phones, radio channels, football matches and television.

Bauls use a number of musical instruments: the most common is the &quot;ektara&quot;, a one-stringed &quot;plucked drum&quot; drone instrument, carved from the epicarp of a gourd, and made of bamboo and goatskin. Others include the &quot;dotara&quot;, a long-necked fretless lute (while the name literally means &quot;two stringed&quot; it usually has four metal strings) made of the wood of a jackfruit or neem tree; besides &quot;khamak&quot;, one-headed drum with a string attached to it which is plucked. The only difference from ektara is that no bamboo is used to stretch the string, which is held by one hand, while being plucked by another. Drums like the duggi, a small hand-held earthen drum, and &quot;dhol&quot; and &quot;khol&quot;; small cymbals called &quot;khartal&quot; and &quot;manjira&quot;, and the bamboo flute are also used. &quot;Ghungur&quot; and &quot;nupur&quot; are anklets with bells that ring while the person wearing them dances.

A Baul family played on stage in London for The Rolling Stones&#x27; Hyde Park concerts in 1971, &#x27;72 and &#x27;78 in front of thousands.

==Influence on Rabindranath Tagore==
The songs of the Bauls and their lifestyle influenced a large part of Bengali culture, but nowhere did it leave its imprint more powerfully than on the work of Rabindranath Tagore, who talked of Bauls in a number of speeches in Europe in the 1930s. An essay based on these was compiled into his English book &quot;The Religion of Man&quot;:

The below quotations are from Tagore&#x27;s book &quot;Creative Unity&quot;.

The following is a translation of the famous Baul song by Gagan Harkara: Ami kothai pabo tare, amar moner manush je re.
The below extract is a translation of another song:

A large tradition in medieval devotional poetry from Rajasthan and other parts of India also bear the same message of unity in celestial and romantic love and that divine love can be fulfilled only through its human beloved.

Tagore&#x27;s own compositions were powerfully influenced by Baul ideology. His music also bears the stamp of many Baul tunes. Other Bengali poets, such as Kazi Nazrul Islam, have also been influenced by Baul music and its message of non-sectarian devotion through love.

The following well-known &quot;Rabindra Sangeet&quot; is heavily influenced by Baul theme:

All bāuls shared only one belief in common—that God is hidden within the heart of man and neither priest, prophet, nor the ritual of any organized religion will help one to find Him there. They felt that both temple and mosque block the path to truth; the search for God must be carried out individually and independently.

==Present status==

Bauls are found in the country of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal and the eastern parts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The Baul movement was at its peak in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but even today one comes across the occasional Baul with his &quot;ektara&quot; (one-stringed musical instrument)

===Bangladesh===

Every year, in the month of Falgun (February to March), &quot;Lalon Smaran Utshab&quot; (Lalon memorial festival) is held in the shrine of Lalon in Kushtia, Bangladesh, where bauls and devotees of Lalon from Bangladesh and overseas come to perform and highlight the mysticism of Lalon.

Palli Baul Samaj Unnayan Sangstha (PBSUS), a Bangladeshi organisation, has been working to uphold and preserve the &#x27;baul&#x27; traditions and philosophy since 2000. The organisation often arranges programmes featuring folk songs for urban audiences.

Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy often organises national and international festivals and seminars, featuring the Baul music and the importance of preservation of Baul tradition.

===India===
In the village of Jaydev Kenduli in Birbhum district of West Bengal, a Mela (fair) is organised in memory of the poet Jayadeva on the occasion of Makar Sankranti in the month of Poush. So many Bauls assemble for the mela that it is also referred to as &quot;Baul Fair&quot;.

In the village of Shantiniketan in West Bengal during Poush Mela, numerous Bauls also come together to enthral people with their music.

Since 2006, an annual music show has been organised in Kolkata called &quot;Baul Fakir Utsav&quot;. Bauls from several districts of Bengal as well as Bangladesh come to perform over a two-day period.

There are also the Western Bauls in America and Europe under the spiritual direction of Lee Lozowick, a student of Yogi Ramsuratkumar. Their music is quite different (rock /gospel/ blues) but the essence of the spiritual practices of the East is well maintained.

In Bangalore near Electronic City Dr. Shivshankar Bhattacharjee has started Boul Sammelon (Gathering of Bauls) on 7–9 April-2017 on the occasion of the inauguration of Sri Sri Kali Bari (Goodness Kali&#x27;s Temple). First time it held in Bangalore to embrace the Boul culture. More than 50 Bouls participated and sang soulful songs.

Currently another version of Baul called the folk fusion also called baul rock is also greatly accepted by the audience, especially in West Bengal. Kartik das baul being a traditional folk singer, who has taken baul to different heights is being associated with folk fusion. This type of baul was brought into the world of music by Bolepur bluez.

Another popular Baul from West Bengal is Rina Das Baul from Bolpur. She, along with her troupe named Rangamatir Baul, had performed in several international functions like Urkult Festival in Sweden in 2017, Armor India festival in France in 2018 and Womex in at Porto, Portugal in 2021. Her music was reviewed by Simon Broughton in Songlines and, in 2019, American Grammy-nominated bluegrass Fiddler Casey Driessen collaborated with her on an album.

==Notable singers==

Lalon also known as Fakir Lalon Shah, Lalon Shah, Lalon Fakir (Bengali: লালন; 17 October 1774 – 17 October 1890; Bengali: 1 Kartik 1179) was a prominent Bengali philosopher, Baul saint, mystic, songwriter, social reformer and thinker. Regarded as an icon of Bengali culture, he inspired and influenced many poets, social and religious thinkers including Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, and Allen Ginsberg although he &quot;rejected all distinctions of caste and creed&quot;. Widely celebrated as an epitome of religious tolerance, he was also accused of heresy during his lifetime and after his death. In his songs, Lalon envisioned a society where all religions and beliefs would stay in harmony.

<text>William Smith Clark (July 31, 1826 – March 9, 1886) was an American professor of chemistry, botany, and zoology; a colonel during the American Civil War; and a leader in agricultural education. Raised and schooled in Easthampton, Massachusetts, Clark spent most of his adult life in Amherst, Massachusetts. He graduated from Amherst College in 1848 and obtained a doctorate in chemistry from Georgia Augusta University in Göttingen in 1852. He then served as professor of chemistry at Amherst College from 1852 to 1867. During the Civil War, he was granted leave from Amherst to serve with the 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, eventually achieving the rank of colonel and the command of that unit.

In 1867, Clark became the third president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He was the first to appoint a faculty and admit a class of students. Although initially successful, MAC was criticized by politicians and newspaper editors who felt it was a waste of funding in a state that was growing increasingly industrial. Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark&#x27;s success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.

Japanese officials, striving to achieve rapid modernization of that country in the wake of the Meiji Restoration, were especially intrigued by Clark&#x27;s work. In 1876, the Japanese government hired Clark as a foreign advisor to establish the Sapporo Agricultural College (SAC), now Hokkaido University. During his eight months in Sapporo, Clark successfully organized SAC, had a significant impact on the scientific and economic development of the island of Hokkaido, and made a lasting imprint on Japanese culture. Clark&#x27;s visage overlooks Sapporo from several statues and his parting words to his Japanese students, &quot;Boys, be ambitious!&quot; (「少年よ大志を抱け &quot;Shōnen yo, taishi o idake&quot;」) have become a nationally known motto in Japan.

After resigning the presidency of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become the president of a mining company, Clark &amp; Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark&#x27;s partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark&#x27;s reputation, his own finances and the fortunes of many of his friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark&#x27;s health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.

==Education and early career==
Born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, on July 31, 1826, William Smith Clark was the son of a country physician, Atherton Clark, and Harriet Smith Clark. In about 1834, his family moved to Easthampton, Massachusetts. Clark was educated at Williston Seminary (now the Williston Northampton School) in Easthampton, and entered Amherst College in 1844. He earned membership in the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society and graduated in the class of 1848. Clark then taught chemistry at Williston Seminary from 1848 to 1850. In 1851, he departed to study chemistry and botany at Georgia Augusta University in Germany, now known as the University of Göttingen, where he earned his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1852.

Later that year, Clark returned to Amherst and accepted a professorship in analytical and applied chemistry at Amherst College. He held that position until 1867. He also served as professor of zoology from 1852 to 1858, and of botany from 1854 to 1858. Shortly after his appointment, Clark began to promote agricultural education, a subject which had attracted his attention during his time in Göttingen. Beginning in 1853, he headed a new Division of Science for the theoretical and practical study of agriculture. The program was not successful, however, and was discontinued in 1857 due to poor enrollment. It became clear to Clark that a new type of institution would be necessary if agricultural education were to be taught effectively. He was a member of the Massachusetts Board of Agriculture from 1859 to 1861 and was the president of the Hampshire Board of Agriculture from 1860 to 1861, and later from 1871 to 1872. He used his position in these organizations to seek support for an agricultural college in Massachusetts.

==Family==

A few months after returning home from Germany, on May 25, 1853, Clark married Harriet Keopuolani Richards Williston. Harriet Williston was the daughter of Clarissa and William Richards, American missionaries to the Kingdom of Hawaii. In 1838, Harriet and her brother Lyman were sent from Hawaii to be taken in by industrialist Samuel Williston so that they could be schooled at Williston Seminary in Easthampton. William Richards died in 1847 in Hawaii. His wife, Clarissa, survived him, however she remained in Hawaii for some time after her husband&#x27;s death and it was agreed that Williston should adopt both Harriet and Lyman Richards. Clark&#x27;s adoptive father-in-law, Samuel Williston, would prove to be an important sponsor to his career. Williston was Amherst College&#x27;s primary benefactor, and a highly influential figure in western Massachusetts.

William and Harriet Clark had 11 children, only 7 of whom survived to adulthood. Their eldest child and daughter, Emily Williston Clark, married F.W. Stearns, the son of prominent trader and department store owner R.H. Stearns. One of their sons, Hubert Lyman Clark, became a prominent zoologist.

==Civil War==
Clark&#x27;s academic career was interrupted by the Civil War. An enthusiastic supporter of the Union cause in the war, Clark took part in student military drill instruction at Amherst College and successfully recruited a number of students. In August 1861, he received a commission of major in the 21st Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. He served with the 21st Massachusetts for nearly two years, eventually commanding that regiment as lieutenant colonel in 1862, and colonel from 1862 to 1863.

During its first months of service, the 21st Massachusetts was assigned garrison duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. In January 1862, the regiment was attached to the Coast Division commanded by Major General Ambrose Burnside and embarked with the division for operations in North Carolina. Clark was placed in command of the regiment in February 1862 and led it in the Battle of New Bern on March 14, 1862. In that action, Clark garnered a reputation for bravery when the regiment charged a Confederate battery and he straddled an enemy cannon, urging his regiment forward. The gun was the first artillery piece captured by the Union Army during that engagement. It was presented by General Burnside to Amherst College in honor of Lieutenant Frazar Stearns, son of the president of Amherst College and adjutant of the 21st Massachusetts, who was killed in the battle. The cannon was mounted inside Morgan Hall at Amherst College.

After the 21st Massachusetts was transferred to Northern Virginia in July 1862, the regiment eventually became part of the Army of the Potomac and took part in several of the largest battles of the war including Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. The regiment suffered its worst casualties during the Battle of Chantilly on September 1, 1862. In the confusion of the battle, fought in thick woods during a thunderstorm, Clark became separated from his regiment and wandered the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the army again. While he was missing, he was incorrectly listed as killed in action and an Amherst newspaper printed his obituary under the headline, &quot;Another Hero Gone.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s enthusiasm for the war waned considerably after the Battle of Fredericksburg during which the Union Army suffered severe casualties in repeated charges against a heavily fortified stone wall. In a January 1863 letter to a friend, Clark wrote that, although he still felt &quot;the principles for which we fight are right and honorable,&quot; he was &quot;disheartened and dissatisfied&quot; with the government and the army. By April 1863, the numbers of the 21st Massachusetts had been so thinned by what Clark called the &quot;cruel fate of war,&quot; that the regiment had virtually ceased to exist and Clark&#x27;s command was only nominal. He therefore resigned his commission and returned to Massachusetts.

==Massachusetts Agricultural College==
The movement for an agricultural college in Massachusetts had begun as early as the 1830s, long before Clark became involved. The leaders of the movement included men such as Marshall Wilder, a prosperous Boston merchant and president of the Norfolk Agricultural Society, and Judge Henry Flagg French, who would become the first president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College. Their efforts met with little progress until the passage of the Morrill Land Grant Act in 1862. Sponsored by U.S. Representative Justin Smith Morrill, the act allotted federal land in the West to each state. The proceeds from the sale of this land were to support the establishment of colleges &quot;related to agriculture and the mechanic arts.&quot; Massachusetts voted to take advantage of this federal program and established the Massachusetts Agricultural College in April 1863.

Proponents of agricultural education, including Clark, felt that scientific advances were bypassing farmers as a class. Clark lamented that farmers in Massachusetts had little access to higher education and that, consequently, the profession was degenerating economically and intellectually. As Clark wrote,

In the good time coming, the refining, elevating, and strengthening influences of high intellectual and aesthetic culture will be considered as desirable in the agricultural profession as they are in medicine, law or theology ... If practical farmers are to remain ignorant of all the higher branches of learning, and to have only the mental discipline and culture of the country public schools, they can never occupy their proper position in society.

The farmer&#x27;s &quot;proper position in society&quot; was in particular jeopardy in New England, according to leaders of the agricultural education movement. Increasing industrialization caused the population of mill towns to grow exponentially in the mid-19th century at the expense of rural towns, many of which were left all but abandoned, especially in western Massachusetts. Adding to the crisis was the phenomenon of westward movement and the lure of cheap land in the Midwest. The agricultural education movement in Massachusetts, in reaction to this crisis, had highly moralistic tones. Clark criticized those who left New England, writing, &quot;Will a wise man exchange the beautiful and diversified scenery of New England ... Will he forsake the school and churches and the social privileges of prosperous communities for the semi-barbarous condition of newly and sparsely settled districts?&quot; Further, Clark warned that if the decay of rural Massachusetts continued, farming would soon be considered, &quot;degrading in its nature, and designed ... only for those poor, stupid, ignorant, or unfortunate persons.&quot;

Clark resigned his commission in the army one month after the MAC was voted into existence by the Massachusetts Legislature. When he returned to Amherst, he quickly sought involvement in the new institution and worked energetically to convince state authorities to locate the college in Amherst. Rival sites under consideration included Springfield, Lexington, and property owned by Harvard University in Roxbury. Elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1864, Clark secured a bond for the Town of Amherst enabling it to contribute $50,000 to the construction of the college buildings. This ultimately swayed the trustees to choose Amherst.

MAC went through two presidents in its first four years and by 1867 still did not have a faculty, nor students, nor finished buildings. Clark became president of the college in 1867 and immediately appointed a faculty and completed a plan for building construction. Clark&#x27;s decisive management enabled the college to admit its first class of 49 students. In addition to being president, he was professor of botany and horticulture.

Although initially regarded as a great success, the college saw poor enrollment over the course of the 1870s. Clark was particularly disappointed with the lack of support from the farming community, writing, &quot;To one who understands fully the greatness of the work which has been done in Amherst … the utter indifference in regard to the college manifested by most of the 75,000 farmers of Massachusetts is truly astounding.&quot;

By the end of his presidency of MAC, Clark was falling under increasing criticism from the press and politicians in Boston. MAC, mounting an increasing debt, was declared a failure by some. Infuriated by what he called, &quot;time-serving politicians and unprincipled newspapers seeking only to float on the tide of public opinion,&quot; Clark resigned in 1879.

Clark was one of the commission of three, appointed by Massachusetts governor John Albion Andrew in 1863, to consider the expediency of establishing a state military academy. He was a presidential elector in 1864, and a representative to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1864–1865 and 1867. He was a member of a number of scientific societies. In 1868, Clark was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences

==Japan==

In 1876, Clark was invited by the government of Japan to establish the Sapporo Agricultural College, now Hokkaido University. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1867, the new Imperial government of Japan set out upon a path of rapid modernization and recruited many European and American academics and military experts to help expedite the process. These men were referred to by the Japanese government as oyatoi gaikokujin or &quot;hired foreigners&quot;.

Seeking a model agricultural college, Mori Arinori, the Japanese Minister to the United States, asked Horace Capron, Commissioner of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, for a recommendation. Capron recommended MAC. After visiting the college, Minister Mori later recommended Clark to the Japanese government as the ideal candidate to establish SAC.

Clark signed his contract with the Japanese government on March 3, 1876, in Washington, DC. Due to inconsistencies in translation, discrepancies exist to this day as to what Clark&#x27;s official title was. According to biographer John Maki, the Japanese and English versions of Clark&#x27;s contract differed on this point. The Japanese version named Clark, &quot;head teacher (namely, assistant director).&quot; Because of this, in Japan, Clark has been referred to as &quot;assistant director&quot; or sometimes &quot;vice-president&quot; of SAC. However, in the English version of the contract, &quot;the word &#x27;President&#x27; was inserted into the text and initialed by Yoshida Kiyonari (the Japanese Minister to the United States at the time).&quot; Regardless of title, Clark enjoyed the complete support of the Japanese government in organizing SAC and he exerted principal authority over the college while he was in Japan.

Clark spent eight months in Sapporo from 1876 to 1877. After enduring negative press in Massachusetts, he was pleased with the enthusiastic cooperation he received from the Japanese government. SAC was organized in just one month. Clark wrote to his wife, &quot;I am actually rebuilding MAC ... on the other side of the earth.&quot; In establishing SAC, Clark introduced the first American model farm and barn in Japan and the first college military unit in the country. He also introduced new crops and new techniques in agriculture, fishing, and animal husbandry.

Clark&#x27;s direct superior while working at SAC was the Governor of Hokkaido (and future Prime Minister of Japan) Kuroda Kiyotaka. The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in that they both had past military experience. Their positive relationship facilitated Clark&#x27;s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.

Hokkaido represented the Japanese frontier at that time and with so much work to be done in colonizing the island, Kuroda welcomed and frequently implemented Clark&#x27;s advice. Clark submitted recommendations to the governor on such diverse subjects as converting migratory fisherman into permanent colonists and establishing a textiles industry. In fact, Clark himself was taken aback by the apparent scope of his influence on colonial affairs, writing to his wife, &quot;Governor Kuroda consults me constantly and always follows my advice.&quot; He later wrote, &quot;I tremble to think how much confidence is reposed in me and what responsibilities I am daily assuming.&quot;

Clark not only had a significant impact on colonial development, but also had a powerful personal effect on the first students of SAC. The same rhetoric of ambition and personal elevation he had employed at MAC resonated more deeply with his Japanese students and, further, with a Japanese nation just emerging from a rigid feudal caste system. During classroom lectures, informal evening talks, and outings to collect botanical specimens, Clark discussed morality and urged his students to, &quot;Be gentlemen.&quot;

Although the Japanese government prohibited the teaching of the Bible in government schools, Clark managed, after considerable effort, to secure approval from Kuroda to make use of the Bible during ethics instruction. In doing so, Clark introduced (Protestant) Christian principles to the first entering class of the college. They, in turn, influenced the students in the second class who enrolled after Clark&#x27;s departure. In 1877, 31 students of SAC converted to Christianity, signing a document drafted by Clark titled, &quot;The Covenant of Believers in Jesus.&quot; Some of them later played important roles in the fields of Christianity, education, and international relations during Japan&#x27;s continuing modernization in the early 20th century. Alumni such as Uchimura Kanzō (founder of the non-church movement, a Japanese Christian society) and Nitobe Inazō (Quaker, educator and diplomat), still known nationwide in Japan, were from the second entering class of the College.

During his stay in Hokkaido, Clark examined the local flora and introduced new species of plants and trees from Japan to the United States. He sent to Massachusetts a large assortment of seeds, many of which proved of special value to his own state, on account of the high latitude from which they were selected. In Teine-ku, Sapporo, he discovered a new lichen on the side of Mt. Teine, at an elevation of , which was named &quot;Cetraria clarkii&quot;, in his honor, by Edward Tuckerman.

On the day of Clark&#x27;s departure, April 16, 1877, students and faculty of SAC rode with him as far as the village of Shimamatsu, then outside of Sapporo. As recalled by one of the students, Masatake Oshima, after saying his farewells, Clark shouted, &quot;Boys, be ambitious!&quot; Several differing versions of Clark&#x27;s parting words persist today including, &quot;Boys, be ambitious, like this old man!&quot; and, &quot;Boys, be ambitious for Christ!&quot; A painting of Clark&#x27;s departure, rendered in 1971, hangs in the Prefectural Capitol building in Sapporo and includes a lengthier version of his parting words, &quot;Boys, be ambitious! Be ambitious not for money or for selfish aggrandizement, not for that evanescent thing which men call fame. Be ambitious for that attainment of all that a man ought to be.&quot;

==Later career==
After his retirement from MAC, Clark became interested in a scientific floating college proposed by entrepreneur and real estate developer James O. Woodruff. This innovative concept attracted national attention and planning moved swiftly. Funds were procured and Clark was named President of the Faculty. Before the enterprise could get underway, Woodruff&#x27;s sudden death caused the abandonment of the scheme.

Following this setback, Clark decided to depart from academia and teamed up with John R. Bothwell in 1880 to form the Clark &amp; Bothwell mining company. For Clark, mining was a logical extension of his background in chemistry and geology. Exactly how Clark became associated with Bothwell, a man of questionable character who had been cashiered from the U.S. Army for fraud, is unknown. As an academic, Clark was ill-prepared for a financial career. This, coupled with Bothwell&#x27;s disreputable history, would result in a short life for the firm.

The firm of Clark &amp; Bothwell opened for business on March 10, 1881, with offices at the corner of Nassau and Wall Street in New York City. The first mine in which the company became invested was the Starr-Grove silver mine, just south of present-day Battle Mountain, Nevada. By the end of 1881 the company, with Clark as President, was involved in seven silver mines, predominantly in Utah and California. Although focused on the American West, the company had far-reaching interests spreading from Mexico to Nova Scotia. The Satemo Mining Company of Tangier, Nova Scotia (named by Clark after a Japanese word which, according to his translation, meant &quot;all right&quot;) became a subsidiary of Clark &amp; Bothwell in the summer of 1881. The company was among the first involved in the Nova Scotia gold rush of that period.

In managing these mines, Clark took an active role as President. He traveled thousands of miles, recommending improvements to mills and machinery and overseeing the improvements. Meeting initial success, the company&#x27;s worth soon amounted to millions of dollars. The good fortune extended throughout the town of Amherst where, according to biographer John Maki, there was a &quot;craze in mining stocks&quot; as Clark&#x27;s friends, family, and former academic colleagues became heavily invested in the company. There were also substantial investors in New York, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities.

The first sign of serious trouble for the company came in March 1882 when the Starr-Grove mine shut down due to lack of profit and increasing debt. The stock values of Clark &amp; Bothwell&#x27;s various mines immediately plunged and were soon unsaleable. The first of what was to be several lawsuits for investment money lost was brought in April 1882. The most damaging development came when one of the subsidiaries, the Stormont Mining Company, sued Clark &amp; Bothwell for funds withheld from Stormont. It soon became apparent that Bothwell, as Treasurer, had mismanaged affairs at the company&#x27;s New York office resulting in the firm&#x27;s collapse. By May 1882, Bothwell was en route to San Francisco and was never heard from again. The scandal was national news and the resulting lawsuits played out in New York and New England newspapers.

Although Clark maintained that he had been &quot;taken in&quot; by Bothwell, his reputation in Amherst was nonetheless destroyed. The stresses of the scandal ruined Clark&#x27;s health, and for the last four years of his life, Clark was largely confined to his home in Amherst due to heart disease. He died in Amherst on March 9, 1886, and is buried in Amherst&#x27;s West Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Although he is almost forgotten in his home state of Massachusetts, Clark remains a national figure in Japan. His influences on the agricultural and economic development of Hokkaido were significant, but it is primarily his cultural message that still resonates today. According to historian Fumiko Fujita, Clark&#x27;s phrase, &quot;Boys, be ambitious!&quot; is &quot;almost immortal in Japan.&quot; The Japanese National Tourism Organization describes the slogan as &quot;famous&quot; and often quoted throughout the country. Historian John Maki wrote that many Japanese school textbooks &quot;have carried brief accounts of [Clark&#x27;s] work and his slogan&quot;, and that Clark&#x27;s name appears on &quot;schools, buildings, shops, confections and countless tourist souvenirs.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s missionary activities produced the Sapporo Independent Christian Church in 1882, founded by students of SAC. It was one of the first cells of Christianity in Japan after the Meiji Restoration. Eventually, ten of the signers of Clark&#x27;s &quot;Covenant in the Believers of Jesus,&quot; raised funds to build the William S. Clark Memorial Church in Sapporo in 1922. The church was demolished in 1962, but rebuilt in another location and still houses the original &quot;Covenant&quot; as well as several Bibles Clark brought to Sapporo.

In the United States, Clark&#x27;s primary legacy is one of ongoing cooperation between the two colleges he founded, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Hokkaido University. Student and faculty exchanges were informal for many years until, according to journalist Daniel Fitzgibbons, the early 1960s when &quot;the U.S. State Department contracted with the University to help strengthen the agricultural curriculum at Hokkaido. Through that program, 11 UMass faculty went to Sapporo and 52 Japanese faculty and students received advanced training in Amherst.&quot; Both universities maintain exchange programs through various academic departments.

In 1969, Professor John H. Foster of the Center for International Agricultural Studies designated the collaboration between the institutions as &quot;the oldest technical assistance relationship between a U.S. university and a foreign university.&quot; In recognition of this fact, and of Clark&#x27;s role in establishing the two colleges, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Hokkaido became sister universities in 1976. On February 7, 1990, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the prefecture of Hokkaido became sister states.

One of the first public works of art in honor of Clark&#x27;s legacy was a bust placed on the campus of the Hokkaido University in 1926 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the establishment of SAC. The original bust was melted down during World War II, but reconstructed in 1947. To mark the 100th anniversary of Clark&#x27;s arrival in Sapporo, the statue of Clark at Hitsujigaoka observation hill was built in 1976. Etched on the base of the statue are Clark&#x27;s famous words, &quot;Boys, Be Ambitious.&quot; The site is a popular tourist destination. Finally, on the campus of the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the William Smith Clark Memorial, a stone and sculptural garden, was dedicated on October 17, 1991. It is located on the former site of Clark&#x27;s house at the peak of Clark Hill. The memorial was designed by landscape architect Todd A. Richardson.

Buildings named after Clark include Clark Hall at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, originally constructed in 1905 to house the Department of Botany, and the Clark Memorial Student Center, built on the campus of the Hokkaido University in 1960, the first and largest western-style collegiate student center in Japan.

<text>Beacon Press is an American left-wing non-profit book publisher. Founded in 1854 by the American Unitarian Association, it is currently a department of the Unitarian Universalist Association. It is known for publishing authors such as James Baldwin, Mary Oliver, Martin Luther King Jr., and Viktor Frankl, as well as &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot;.

==History==
The history of Beacon Press actually begins in 1825, the year the American Unitarian Association (AUA) was formed. This liberal religious movement had the enlightened notion to publish and distribute books and tracts that would spread the word of their beliefs not only about theology but also about society and justice.

=== The early years: 1854–1900 ===
In the Press of the American Unitarian Association (as Beacon was called then) purchased and published works that were largely religious in nature and &quot;conservative Unitarian&quot; in viewpoint (far more progressive, nonetheless, than many other denominations). The authors were often Unitarian ministers—dead or alive, American or British, mostly Caucasian, and far more male than female. Many of the books were collections of sermons, lectures, and letters, balanced by volumes of devotion, hymns, and morally uplifting tales.

=== New century, new mission: 1900–1945 ===
In the early 1900s Samuel Eliot broadened the mission of the press by publishing books dealing with ethical, sociological, philanthropic, and similar subjects, as well as those of a more strictly religious character... Although books of marked theology and religious note continued to have a predominant place in Association publication, the wide interest in all subjects relating to social and moral betterment were included and the evergrowing topics of war and peace and arbitration, or national amity and racial brotherhood were represented

=== The modern era: 1945– ===
In 1949, Beacon published &quot;American Freedom and Catholic Power&quot;, an anti-Catholic tome written by socialist and secular humanist Paul Blanshard, who was the assistant editor for The Nation. Beacon would go on to publish several other books by Blanshard critical of Catholicism over the next few decades.

Under director Gobin Stair (1962–75), new authors included James Baldwin, Kenneth Clark, André Gorz, Herbert Marcuse, Jürgen Habermas, Howard Zinn, Ben Bagdikian, Mary Daly, and Jean Baker Miller. Wendy Strothman became Beacon&#x27;s director in 1983; she set up the organization&#x27;s first advisory board, a group of scholars and publishing professionals who advised on book choices and direction. She turned a budget deficit into a surplus. In 1995, her last year at Beacon, Strothman summarized the Press&#x27;s mission: &quot;We at Beacon publish the books we choose because they share a moral vision and a sense that greater understanding can influence the course of events. They are books we believe in.&quot; Strothman was replaced by Helene Atwan in 1995.

In 1971, it published the &quot;Senator Gravel edition&quot; of &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot; for the first time in book form, when no other publisher was willing to risk publishing such controversial material. Robert West, then-president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, approved the decision to publish &quot;The Pentagon Papers&quot;, which West claims resulted in two-and-a-half years of harassment and intimidation by the Nixon administration. In &quot;Gravel v. United States&quot;, the Supreme Court decided that the Constitution&#x27;s &quot;Speech or Debate Clause&quot; protected Gravel and some acts of his aide, but not Beacon Press.

Beacon Press seeks to publish works that &quot;affirm and promote&quot; several principles:

Beacon Press is a member of the Association of University Presses.

==Books and authors==
Beacon Press publishes non-fiction, fiction, and poetry titles. Some of Beacon&#x27;s best-known titles are listed below.

==Book series==
The following is a list of some of the principal series; it is not comprehensive.
===The King Legacy (series)===
In 2009, Beacon Press announced a new partnership with the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. for a new book series publishing program, &quot;The King Legacy.&quot; As part of the program, Beacon is printing new editions of previously published King titles and compiling Dr. King&#x27;s writings, sermons, orations, lectures, and prayers into entirely new editions, including new introductions by leading scholars.

==&quot;Beacon Broadside&quot;==
Beacon Press launched its blog, &quot;Beacon Broadside&quot;, in late September 2007.

==Awards==
In 1992, Beacon won a New England Book Award for publishing. In 1993, Beacon was voted &quot;Trade Publisher of the Year&quot; by the Literary Market Place.

<doc id="519987" wikidata="Q1233837" url="?curid=519987" title="Synoptic scale meteorology">
<text>In meteorology, the synoptic scale (also called the large scale or cyclonic scale) is a horizontal length scale of the order of or more. This corresponds to a horizontal scale typical of mid-latitude depressions (e.g. extratropical cyclones). Most high- and low-pressure areas seen on weather maps (such as surface weather analyses) are synoptic-scale systems, driven by the location of Rossby waves in their respective hemisphere. Low-pressure areas and their related frontal zones occur on the leading edge of a trough within the Rossby wave pattern, while high-pressure areas form on the back edge of the trough. Most precipitation areas occur near frontal zones. The word &quot;&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &quot;seen together&quot;.

The Navier–Stokes equations applied to atmospheric motion can be simplified by scale analysis in the synoptic scale. It can be shown that the main terms in horizontal equations are Coriolis force and pressure gradient terms; therefore, one can use geostrophic approximation. In vertical coordinates, the momentum equation simplifies to the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.

==Surface weather analysis==
A surface weather analysis is a special type of weather map that provides a view of weather elements over a geographical area at a specified time based on information from ground-based weather stations. Weather maps are created by plotting or tracing the values of relevant quantities such as sea level pressure, temperature, and cloud cover onto a geographical map to help find synoptic scale features such as weather fronts.

The first weather maps in the 19th century were drawn well after the fact to help devise a theory on storm systems. After the advent of the telegraph, simultaneous surface weather observations became possible for the first time. Beginning in the late 1840s, the Smithsonian Institution became the first organization to draw real-time surface analyses. Use of surface analyses began first in the United States, spreading worldwide during the 1870s. Use of the Norwegian cyclone model for frontal analysis began in the late 1910s across Europe, with its use finally spreading to the United States during World War II.

Surface weather analyses have special symbols which show frontal systems, cloud cover, precipitation, or other important information. For example, an &quot;H&quot; represents high pressure, implying good and fair weather. An &quot;L&quot; represents low pressure, which frequently accompanies precipitation. Various symbols are used not just for frontal zones and other surface boundaries on weather maps, but also to depict the present weather at various locations on the weather map. Areas of precipitation help determine the frontal type and location. Mesoscale systems and boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines are also analyzed on surface weather analyses. Isobars are commonly used to place surface boundaries from the horse latitudes poleward, while streamline analyses are used in the tropics.

==Extratropical cyclone==
An extratropical cyclone is a synoptic scale low-pressure weather system that has neither tropical nor polar characteristics, being connected with fronts and horizontal gradients in temperature and dew point otherwise known as &quot;baroclinic zones&quot;.

The descriptor &quot;extratropical&quot; refers to the fact that this type of cyclone generally occurs outside of the tropics, in the middle latitudes of the planet. These systems may also be described as &quot;mid-latitude cyclones&quot; due to their area of formation, or &quot;post-tropical cyclones&quot; where extratropical transition has occurred, but are often described as &quot;depressions&quot; or &quot;lows&quot; by weather forecasters and the public. These are the everyday phenomena that, along with anticyclones, drive the weather over much of the Earth.

Although extratropical cyclones are almost always classified as baroclinic since they form along zones of temperature and dew point gradient within the westerlies, they can sometimes become barotropic late in their life cycle when the temperature distribution around the cyclone becomes fairly uniform with radius. An extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone, if it dwells over warm waters and develops central convection, which warms its core.

==Surface high-pressure systems==
High-pressure systems are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere. Subsidence will generally dry out an air mass by adiabatic, or compressional, heating. Thus, high pressure typically brings clear skies. During the day, since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight, there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise. At night, the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation (i.e. heat energy from the surface) is not absorbed, giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons. When surface winds become light, the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge, leading to widespread haze. If the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight, fog can form.

Strong, vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses. The low, sharp inversion can lead to areas of persistent stratocumulus or stratus cloud, colloquially known as anticyclonic gloom. The type of weather brought about by an anticyclone depends on its origin. For example, extensions of the Azores high pressure may bring about anticyclonic gloom during the winter, as they are warmed at the base and will trap moisture as they move over the warmer oceans. High pressures that build to the north and extend southwards will often bring clear weather. This is due to being cooled at the base (as opposed to warmed) which helps prevent clouds from forming.

On weather maps, these areas show converging winds (isotachs), also known as confluence, or converging height lines near or above the level of non-divergence, which is near the 500 hPa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere. High-pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones. On weather maps, high-pressure centers are associated with the letter H in English, or A in Spanish, because alta is the Spanish word for high, within the isobar with the highest pressure value. On constant pressure upper level charts, it is located within the highest height line contour.

==Weather fronts==
A weather front is a boundary separating two masses of air of different densities, and is the principal cause of meteorological phenomena. In surface weather analyses, fronts are depicted using various colored lines and symbols, depending on the type of front. The air masses separated by a front usually differ in temperature and humidity.
Cold fronts may feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather, and may on occasion be preceded by squall lines or dry lines. Warm fronts are usually preceded by stratiform precipitation and fog. The weather usually clears quickly after a front&#x27;s passage. Some fronts produce no precipitation and little cloudiness, although there is invariably a wind shift.

Cold fronts and occluded fronts generally move from west to east, while warm fronts move poleward. Because of the greater density of air in their wake, cold fronts and cold occlusions move faster than warm fronts and warm occlusions. Mountains and warm bodies of water can slow the movement of fronts. When a front becomes stationary, and the density contrast across the frontal boundary vanishes, the front can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind velocity, known as a shearline. This is most common over the open ocean.
