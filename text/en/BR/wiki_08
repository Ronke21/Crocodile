<text>Khoy (, ) is a city in the Central District of Khoy County, West Azerbaijan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district. Occupied since Median times, it shares a long history as an important Christian center.

==History==
Khoy was named in ancient times for the salt mines that made it an important spur of the Silk Route. 3000 years ago, a city existed on the area where Khoy is located nowadays, but its name became Khoy only in the 14th centuries ago. In 714 BC, Sargon II passed the region of which Khoy is part of in a campaign against Urartu.

During the reign of Greater Armenia this city was a part of Nor-Shirakan province (ashkar). Khoy was mentioned in the 8th century AD and was called &quot;Her&quot; by Anania Shirakatsi in &quot;Ashkharatsuyts&quot;.

In the Parthian period, Khoy was the gateway of the Parthian Empire in the Northwest. During the reign of Armenian king Tigranes the Great, Khoy is mentioned as being an important settlement of the Silk Route. Around the year 37 BC, Mark Antony had crossed the plain that is located between Khoy and Marand during one of the many and frequent Roman-Parthian Wars.

Scholars such as Josef Markwart consider Khoy to be the identical to the &quot;Gobdi&quot; station mentioned in the &quot;Tabula Peutingeriana&quot;.

One of the important historic elements of the city is Surp Sarkis Church. Armenian documents wrote that the date of the making has to be either 332 or 333 AD. In the city and its surrounding villages, churches are seen and it is reported that Armenians have always been comprising a significant amount of the city’s population.

By the first half of the 11th century the Byzantine emperors were actively trying to round off their eastern territories, in an attempt to absorb the unstable Armenian dynasties. In 1021-2 emperor Basil II led his army as far as Khoy within 175 km of Dvin, and obtained the surrender of royalty from the Artsruni dynasty of Van.

In 1210, the city was conquered by the forces of Kingdom of Georgia sent by Tamar the Great under the command of Zakaria and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli. This was a response to the sacking of Georgian-controlled Ani which occurred in 1208 and left 12,000 Christians dead.

The city was ruled over by Malika, wife of Jalal al-Din Mangburni after his conquest of the city in the late 1220s.

===Modern period===

In the wake of the demise of the Safavids, the Ottomans took Khoy on 6 May 1724, a territorial gain which was confirmed with Imperial Russia through the Treaty of Constantinople (1724).

Until 1828, Khoy had a large number of Armenians; however, the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), gave the Russians the right to encourage Armenians to immigrate into the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, a small Armenian population remained living in Khoy. This was noted by an American missionary in 1834. He noted further that in the villages around Khoy there were a few more, but the vast majority had migrated to the North of the Aras river following Russia&#x27;s victory over Persia in 1828 and the encouraged settling in the newly incorporated Russian regions of Eastern Armenia.

With the advent of the 1910s, Khoy was occupied by Ottoman troops, but they were completely expelled from the area by the Russians by 1911. Khoy was one of the many cities in Iran which garrisoned Russian infantry and Cossacks. The Russians retreated at the time of Enver Pasha&#x27;s offensive in the Iran-Caucasus region, but returned in around early 1916, and stayed in the region up to the wake of the Russian Revolution. In 1918, for a final brief period, the Ottomans took Khoy until the decisive end of World War I and the Armistice of Mudros. In World War II, Khoy was again occupied by Soviet troops, who remained until 1946. After 1946 the city indefinitely became part of Iran and is located in the far northwest of the country.

<text>Praise the Lard is an album by PIG (Raymond Watts), initially released on Concrete Productions in 1991 and re-released by Cleopatra Records in 1997.

The re-released version has an incorrect track listing, due to the use of artwork from the original LP version. Cleopatra Records reissued the album after &quot;purchasing&quot; the rights from someone who did not legally own them. Raymond has indicated his desire to re-release the album, possibly with bonus tracks, but the album is currently unavailable in all markets (as of 2017).

<text>The Lethbridge Viaduct, commonly known as the High Level Bridge, is a railway trestle bridge over the Oldman River in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. Constructed between 1907 and 1909 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, it is the largest railway structure in Canada and the largest of its type in the world, and is still regularly maintained and used over a century since its construction.

In 2005, the construction of the viaduct was recognized as an event of national historic significance.

== History ==

Prior to the Lethbridge Viaduct, the main railway crossing over the Oldman River was a wooden trestle measuring long and high. The trestles on the original line out of Lethbridge totalled . Many railways in the area went through the Crowsnest Pass between Lethbridge and Fort Macleod, over steep grades that hampered operations. In addition, extensive cuts and many other bridges were needed to cross various creeks and coulees. Past the St. Mary River crossing, several large cuts and large bridges were also required, including a trestle with a span west of the St. Mary River, a trestle at Eight-Mile Coulee, and another of in length near Eight-Mile Coulee. At Sixteen-Mile Coulee there was a trestle, high with a truss span over the creek.

Although the original route accomplished its purpose in allowing the CPR to rapidly complete the railway, it turned out to be expensive to operate. The original bridges were designed to last only about 10 years. In 1905, the CPR decided, to construct a completely new route on a better gradient to bypass the original line. The new line was built to the north of the Oldman River. It required two bridges, one in Lethbridge—the &quot;High Level Bridge&quot;—over the Oldman River, and another large bridge over the Oldman River again west of Monarch. This route eliminated many curves and reduced the grade from 1.2 percent to only 0.4 percent. It also saved of track.

The Lethbridge Viaduct was designed by the CPR&#x27;s bridge department in Montreal, Quebec. Construction began in the summer of 1907, directed by CPR&#x27;s Assistant Chief Engineer John Edward Schwitzer. Clearing and grading the site, construction of piers, and placement of the footings progressed while the steelwork was being prefabricated. The steelwork was manufactured by the Canadian Bridge Company of Walkerville, Ontario. Raising the steelwork began in mid-August 1908 and was performed by around 100 workers. Transport of the steel to the site required 645 railway cars while another 40 were needed to bring in equipment. Once the steelwork reached track level at the Lethbridge end, it was possible to begin assembly using a huge travelling crane called an &quot;erection traveller&quot;, which was built on site at a cost of $100,000 and was used to lower the steel beams and girders into place. The last girder was placed in June 1909 and riveting was completed in August 1909. The total cost of the Lethbridge Viaduct&#x27;s construction was $1,334,525.

== Specifications ==
* Length: 
* Height: above river bed
* Materials: of steel
* Deck spans and lengths:
** 44 plate girder spans each of 
** 22 plate girder spans each of 
** one riveted lattice-truss of 
* Rigid braced steel towers: total of 33

The second bridge over the Oldman River, near Monarch, is long and high.

== In popular culture ==
The Lethbridge Viaduct appears in the 4th episode of the 2023 TV series &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. Through videographic editing, the bridge is depicted as abandoned for decades and collapsed in the middle.
It is also prominent in the 1976 movie Silver Streak.

<text>St Kilda East is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 6 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Glen Eira and Port Phillip local government areas. St Kilda East recorded a population of 12,571 at the 2021 census.

St Kilda East is one of the more diverse and densely populated suburbs of Melbourne. It has a prominent Hasidic Jewish community, descended from Polish and Russian immigrants. Quiet and residential, it is quite different from the adjacent suburb of St Kilda. However, the area around Carlisle Street is very diverse with a strong arts, alternative and indie community.

==History==

The St Kilda East area was part of the lands of the Boon wurrung tribe of Indigenous Australians before being first settled by Anglo-British settlers in the 1850s. Smaller timber shacks were common during the early 1860s to 1870s, with larger houses on the bigger subdivisions. During the late 1870s, terraced housing began around the railway line.

Alma Park was laid out and areas surrounding the park were set aside for religious purposes, resulting in a large number of convents and chapels along Chapel Street and either side of Dandenong Road. In the 1950s, speculative development resulted in the alteration of many of the suburb&#x27;s streetscapes. Centred on Chapel Street and to the east of the railway line, flats became common in the area.

Recent development of the suburbs, rising land values and excellent access to public transport has seen recent gentrification in the area. Modern infill medium density apartments are being built on many blocks, with the Carlisle Street area designated an activity centre under the Melbourne 2030 planning scheme.

==Demographics==
64.6% were born in Australia. Other Countries of birth top responses were England 3.9%, India 2.3%, New Zealand 2.2%, United States of America 2.2% &amp; Israel 1.7%. 

Religious affiliation top responses were No Religion (so described) 41.5%, Judaism 26.4, Catholic 11.2%, Not Stated 7% &amp; Anglican 2.8%.

==Education institutions==

The main schools in St Kilda East are the Edmund Rice Campus of St Mary’s College, the Caulfield Campus of Caulfield Grammar School, Malvern Community School, Ripponlea Primary School, the St Kilda East campus of Mount Scopus Memorial College, Yeshivah College, Cheder Levi Yitchak, Bnos Chana, Beth Rivkah Ladies College and part of St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School. The Rabbinical College of Australia and New Zealand (Yeshivah Gedolah Zal), a tertiary institution for the training of Orthodox rabbis and religious functionaries in the Chabad-Lubavitch denomination, is located on Alexandra Street.

Ripponlea Primary School (No. 4087) was opened on 3 July 1922 with 400 pupils in grades prep to eight. John Edward Woodruff (1867-1944) was the school&#x27;s first headmaster, and he served as such until his retirement in 1932. In 2011 enrolment at the school was 272 students across prep to grade 6.

==Culture==

St Kilda East is home to the Red Stitch Actors Theatre, a professional theatre, located on the corner of Dandenong Road and Chapel Street.

==Transport==

St Kilda East is served by several forms of public transport.

Major tram routes operate on Carlisle Street/Balaclava Road, Chapel Street, Dandenong Road and St Kilda Road.

Buses operate along Orrong Road and Hotham Street.

Balaclava and Ripponlea railway stations, on the Sandringham line, also service the suburb.

==Landmarks==
===Residential architecture===
The suburb is dominated by 1960s flats. There are, however, some pockets of preserved heritage streetscapes. Godfrey Avenue has well-preserved rows of Edwardian cottages on either side of the street and is protected by council heritage controls. Camden Street has several rows of Victorian semi-detached timber workers cottages.

Some large Victorian buildings remain along Inkerman Street and Alma Road, but have been since subdivided into flats. The streets in between have a mix of housing from different periods.

===Non-residential architecture===
===Places of worship===
There are several churches in St Kilda East, and multiple synagogues, reflecting the area&#x27;s extensive history of both Christian and Jewish migration. Many of these buildings have historic significance with heritage registration, and often form various religious precincts.

====Judaism====
Yeshiva Centre is the headquarters and main synagogue of Chabad in Melbourne.

Chabad House of Caulfield is a replica of the New York headquarters of the Chabad movement at 770 Eastern Parkway.

====Anglican====
The bluestone All Saints Anglican Church on Chapel Street was built in 1861, and is reputed to have the largest seating capacity of any Anglican parish church in the Southern hemisphere, with a capacity of 1500 in the pews. The neighbouring Parish Hall was built as an extension to the church in 1909 and was restored in 2005 during a conversion into a boutique gymnasium.

Another Anglican Parish Church is St James the Great, established in 1914 and located at 435 Inkerman Street. St James was founded in close association with the former Church of England St John&#x27;s Theological College, which was located in nearby Alma Road, on the lot now bisected by Wilgah Street. The Diocese closed the seminary in 1919 amid some controversy directed towards the then perceived Anglo-Catholicity of the seminary (which was at odds with the prevailing sentiment of the diocese at the time). The land was sold and subdivided.
====Roman Catholic====
The St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church (208-214 Dandenong Road), designed by William Wardell and built in 1858, was one of the earliest bluestone churches.

The East St Kilda Uniting Church, on the corner of Hotham and Inkerman Streets, was built in 1887, to the design of architect Hillson Beasley. Originally a church of the Congregational Union of Australia prior to the formation of the Uniting Church, it was sold by the Uniting Church to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Melbourne in 2011 for the establishment of an Eastern Orthodox use church, according to the provisions of an Ordinariate.
====Uniting Church====
The St George&#x27;s Uniting Church, on Chapel Street, was built in 1877, to the design of Albert Purchas and is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. It has been leased by St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School since 1990.
====Orthodox====
The former Balaclava Corps Hall, built in 1929 on Camden Street, is an unusual design, featuring castellated motifs. It was sold to the Autocephalous Orthodox Ukrainian Church in 1976, now being the parish of The Sacred Assumption of the Holy Virgin.

===Public spaces===
The suburb&#x27;s main park is Alma Park, a large park designed by Clement Hodgkinson in 1867, which was split into two linear parks by the Sandringham railway line in 1858. The park has recreational facilities, including a heritage rotunda, a cricket and football (soccer) oval and bike paths, as well as large stands of elm trees, Moreton Bay Figs and native vegetation areas.

====St Kilda General Cemetery====
St Kilda Cemetery covers a large block bordered by Dandenong Road, Hotham Street, Alma Road and Alexandra Street. It is bounded by a historic wall and contains many Victorian era graves. The cemetery is the resting place of Alfred Deakin, the second Prime Minister of Australia, and Albert Jacka VC, MC, barrister and Mayor of St Kilda (1930).

===East St Kilda Heritage Study===

<doc id="511506" wikidata="Q57840" url="?curid=511506" title="Philémon Yang">
<text>Philémon Yunji Yang (born 14 June 1947) is a Cameroonian politician who served as Prime Minister of Cameroon from 2009 to 2019, having previously held various ministerial and diplomatic roles particularly in Canada where he served as the ambassador of Cameroon to Canada for over 20 years. He is the longest-serving Prime Minister in Cameroonian history, having served 9 years, 9 months and 3 days. In June 2024 he was elected to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly for its seventy-ninth session, beginning his term on 10 September 2024.

==Early life and education==
Yang was born in Jikejem-Oku, in the Oku subdivision of the Bui division of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. He studied law at the University of Yaoundé.

==Career==
===Early appointments===
Yang served as a prosecutor at the Buea court of appeal before being appointed to the government in 1975 as Deputy Minister of Territorial Administration. In 1979 he became Minister of Mines and Energy, remaining in that position until he was dismissed from the government in 1984. 

===Ambassador and High Commissioner in Canada===
Yang served as Ambassador to Canada from 1984 to 1995 − and as High Commissioner in Canada from 1995 to 2004, after Cameroon joined the Commonwealth of Nations. He also served as Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in Canada for about 10 years. His time in Ottawa was dedicated to securing foreign aid for his country, despite Canadian concerns about human rights abuses and corruption. Along with other representatives of African countries, he was pleased by Canada&#x27;s commitment to debt relief in 2000. He headed Cameroon&#x27;s delegation in negotiations on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety from 1998 to 2000, and after the Protocol was adopted he chaired the Intergovernmental Committee for the Cartagena Protocol.

===Return to domestic politics===
In 2004 Yang was appointed Assistant Secretary-General of the Presidency of Cameroon. In 2008 he became chair of the board of directors of the Cameroon Airlines Corporation.

===Prime Minister of Cameroon===

On 30 June 2009 President Paul Biya appointed Yang as Prime Minister of Cameroon, replacing Ephraïm Inoni. Yang&#x27;s appointment marked the largest government shake-up since his predecessor was appointed in 2004. Biya stated on state radio that three ministers from the previous government had switched places, six new names were added while six portfolios were cut entirely. The opposition said that it did not expect a great deal of change due in part to the continuance of a large government. It had been hoping for 30 ministerial positions to be cut, but there remained over 60 ministers. The reshuffle was believed to have been spurred by public anger over rising food prices and discontent with high levels of government corruption. Adding to this, the move was seen as an attempt by Biya to shore up support for the next presidential election in 2011. In addition to Yang, new ministers were appointed for defence, posts and telecommunications, communication, education, promotion of women, water and energy, and sports.

Yang stepped down as Prime Minister on 4 January 2019.

===President of the United Nations General Assembly===
On 6 June 2024 Yang was elected to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly for its seventy-ninth session, succeeding Dennis Francis of Trinidad and Tobago on 10 September 2024.

<text>South Melbourne is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. South Melbourne recorded a population of 11,548 at the 2021 census.

Historically known as Emerald Hill, South Melbourne was one of the first of Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs to adopt full municipal status and is one of Melbourne&#x27;s oldest suburban areas, notable for its well preserved Victorian era streetscapes.

The current boundaries are complex. Starting at the east end of Dorcas Street, it runs along the rear of properties on St Kilda Road, then south along Albert Road, north up Canterbury Road, along the rear of the north side of St Vincent Place, zigzags west along St Vincent Street, then north up Pickles Street. There is then an arm of former industrial land to the west between Boundary Road, the freeway and Ferrars Street. It then runs along Market Street to Kingsway, then up Dorcas Street to St Kilda Road.

==History==

Before European settlement, the area now called South Melbourne stood out as largely flat with central hill (where the Town Hall now stands) surrounded by swampy land to the north and south. The hill was a traditional social and ceremonial meeting place for Aboriginal Australian peoples. 

The area was colonised by Europeans in the 1840s and became known as Emerald Hill. 

During the Victorian Gold Rush of 1851 a tent city, known as &quot;Canvas Town&quot; was established. The area soon became a massive slum, home to tens of thousands of fortune seekers from around the world. 

Land sales at Emerald Hill began in 1852, and while the hill itself was reserved as the site for an orphanage, Canvas Town was soon replaced by cottages, including many that were prefabricated overseas in timber and corrugated iron. Independence from the City of Melbourne was granted when Emerald Hill was proclaimed a borough on 26 May 1855. In 1857, Melbourne&#x27;s second railway line, to St Kilda, was created running through the new municipality. 

On 6 August 1868, a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Record&quot;, began publication. In 1872, it changed its name to &quot;The Record and Emerald Hill and Sandridge Advertiser&quot;, reverting to &quot;The Record&quot; in 1881. &quot;The Record&quot; continued publication until 22 December 1954.

The new municipality developed rapidly and by 1872 Emerald Hill was proclaimed a town. By the 1870s, parts of South Melbourne became a favoured place of residents for the wealthy, particularly in St Vincent Gardens, Melbourne&#x27;s best London style residential square (which mostly lies in Albert Park), but most of the locality was developed with more modest single storey terraces and cottages, some in timber. The orphanage on the hill relocated in 1878, and the crest of the hill become the site of the South Melbourne Town Hall, built between 1879 and 1880, and designed in suitable grandeur to evoke the city&#x27;s booming status, establishing a civic heart at Bank Street. In 1883 Emerald Hill became a city, changing its official name to South Melbourne. 

South Melbourne experienced a decline in the 1950s as Melbourne sprawled outwards. Like many other Melbourne inner city suburbs, during the 1960s, the Housing Commission of Victoria stepped in and erected several high-rise public housing towers including the earliest high rise, &quot;Emerald Hill Court,&quot; and the tallest, &quot;Park Towers&quot; (c.1969). They soon housed some of Melbourne&#x27;s postwar migrants, who also lived in the many modest cottages, adding a multicultural flavour to the area. 

In the 1980s, like other inner suburban areas, South Melbourne&#x27;s gentrification got under way, and many of the terrace houses and cottages were renovated and a new middle class moved in. From the 1990s, the industrial districts of South Melbourne, closer to the city, and including Southbank, have been redeveloped with mid and high rise apartments; in 1996 the most intensively developed part of Southbank was transferred to the City of Melbourne. At the same time, the City of South Melbourne was amalgamated with the Cities of St Kilda and Port Melbourne to create the City of Port Phillip.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, were 10,920 people in South Melbourne. 55.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.8%, China 3.0%, New Zealand 2.8%, India 1.5% and Malaysia 1.4%. 66.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.9%, Greek 2.8%, Russian 1.9%, Cantonese 1.3% and Italian 1.2%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.7% and Catholic 17.3%.

==Transport==

South Melbourne is served by tram routes 1, 12, 58, and 96. Route 96 runs along the former St Kilda railway line, which was converted to light rail in 1987.

In 2006 there were strong calls by a joint council project and the Inner Melbourne Action Group to provide an inner south tram link between the City of Port Phillip and the City of Stonnington, by connecting route 112 with route 8 via Park Street. This would have required less than 100 metres of track to be laid along the Park Street gap to create the new route.

==Geography==
===Commercial areas===
The main commercial district is centred on Clarendon Street and side streets, including an area around the South Melbourne Market, with many retailers, cafes, eateries, art galleries and more.

Like the Melbourne CBD, there are many small laneways in South Melbourne, most of them cobbled in bluestone.

===Housing===

South Melbourne&#x27;s predominant housing is terraced or semi-detached Victorian.

Park Towers is a notable example of Housing Commission of Victoria hi-rise public housing. There are a number of such towers in parts of South Melbourne, built since the 1960s.

In recent years, South Melbourne has seen an increase in population density, due to apartment development in nearby Southbank, where development has spilled over from the Melbourne CBD. To the east, towards the St Kilda Road complex, are many high rise office buildings.

===Heritage===

The Victorian era terraced house and cottage areas of South Melbourne are extensive and mostly heritage-listed. A handful of original prefabricated cottages have survived, with a corrugated iron example in Coventry Street now a museum run by the National Trust. The elaborate town hall with its tall clock tower is one of the landmarks of Melbourne&#x27;s heritage of Victorian architecture. The block that the town hall stands on was all developed in the late 1870s-1880s with substantial terrace houses and shops, and remains intact to this day.

See Yup Temple is a Chinese temple, built in 1856, is Melbourne&#x27;s most notable reminder of the Chinese immigration during the gold rush.

==Television industry==

South Melbourne features television production studios owned by the Seven Network and Global Television in the south of the suburb. This was formerly the Melbourne studios of the Seven Network prior to them moving to the Melbourne Docklands&#x27;s Digital Broadcast Centre. Several Seven Network shows like &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and &quot;It Takes Two&quot; were filmed at the South Melbourne location whilst &quot;Seven News&quot; is filmed at Docklands.

==Sport==
South Melbourne FC is regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s most successful soccer clubs, with four national titles to their name. They currently play in the Victorian Premier League at Lakeside Stadium, a rectangular stadium built on Lake Oval, the former home ground of the South Melbourne Swans. Historically, they have been known as South Melbourne Hellas, a tribute to the migrant Greek founders of the club and traditionally played at Middle Park. 

It was once home to the South Melbourne Swans, which played in the Victorian Football League (VFL), which played out of the Lake Oval (now Lakeside Stadium) in nearby Albert Park, before relocating to Sydney in 1982 in a radical move, which eventually spawned the national Australian Football League. 

A new athletics track and field facility replaced the earlier updated soccer ground, but soccer is still present in the centre of the track.

<doc id="511517" wikidata="Q5044723" url="?curid=511517" title="Carole Pope">
<text>Carole Ann Pope (born 6 August 1945) is a British-born Canadian rock singer-songwriter, whose provocative blend of hard-edged new wave rock with explicit homoerotic and BDSM-themed lyrics made her one of the first openly lesbian entertainers to achieve mainstream fame.

==Early life==
Pope was born on 6 August 1945 in the rural outskirts of Manchester in England. She was the oldest of four children born to Jack Pope, a salesperson, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, and a circus stilt walker, and to Celia, a music hall performer. Pope grew up with two sisters, Diane and Elaine, and a brother, Howard. At the age of five, Pope emigrated with her parents to Montreal. After a couple of years there, the family moved to the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario. She studied at Cedarbrae Collegiate Institute.

==Music career==
===1968–1988: Rough Trade===

Pope met her longtime musical partner Kevan Staples at a band audition in Scarborough. In 1968, they began performing together as a duo in Yorkville, which was Toronto&#x27;s live music and arts district at the time. In 1970, they adopted the name O, changing it to The Bullwhip Brothers the following year. Clive A. Smith was also a member of O; Smith would later go on to co-found Canadian animation studio Nelvana and play such iconic on-screen characters as Mr. Pencil.

In 1975, Pope and Staples recruited several backup musicians and formed the band Rough Trade. Pope often performed in black leather pants and bondage attire. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Rough Trade Live&quot;, was produced by Jack Richardson.

Whilst with Rough Trade, Pope sang backup vocals on Murray McLauchlan&#x27;s album &quot;Into a Mystery,&quot; in 1980, and would go on to win the Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist in 1981 and subsequently the Juno Award for Best Female Vocalist in 1982 and 1983.

Rough Trade released their first studio album, Avoid Freud, and also made an appearance in the Canadian horror film, Deadline, in 1980. They would win a Genie Award and four gold and two platinum records as the decade progressed. She and Kevan Staples co-wrote the 1983 single &quot;Transformation&quot; along with the track &quot;Design for Living&quot;, for singer/songwriter Nona Hendryx&#x27;s second studio album, Nona. Pope also appeared as a guest vocalist on the Payola$ single &quot;Never Said I Loved You,&quot; which was a top 10 hit in 1983. She would team up again with Payola$ founder Paul Hyde to sing the duet &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; on his album &quot;Living Off the Radar&quot; in 2000. She also sang the role of Primavera Nicholson in the COC production of R. Murray Schafer&#x27;s Patria I in November 1987.

Although Rough Trade did not record or perform extensively after its final Deep Six in &#x27;86 tour, they did not officially break up until 1988. Since breaking up, the band has had numerous reunions, and in 2022, &quot;Rough Trade - The Musical&quot;, a musical based on the band&#x27;s music (and the life of Pope&#x27;s late brother, Howard), debuted at Joe&#x27;s Pub, in Manhattan.

=== 1988–1999: Solo Beginnings ===
After Rough Trade disbanded, Pope released her debut solo single in 1988, which was a cover of The Flirtations&#x27; 1968 soul hit, Nothing but a Heartache. The B-side was her self-penned song, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Blind&quot;. She relocated to Los Angeles in 1989 to pursue opportunities in soundtrack work and acting, and produced the soundtrack for The Silencer, a thriller movie directed by Amy Goldstein, which was released in 1992.

In 1995, Pope announced she was no longer living in Los Angeles. That same year, she released her debut EP, Radiate, featuring drummer Jack Irons. A music video was produced to promote the EP&#x27;s third track, Kiss The Ground. Pope also starred in the cabaret, &quot;Quiet Please, There&#x27;s a Bitter, Petulant Diva on Stage, at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre.&quot; In 1997, Pope provided the voice for the schoolteacher in the animated version of Pippi Longstocking, and in 1999 playwright Bryden MacDonald staged Shaking the Foundations, a musical revue based on the music of Rough Trade.

=== 2000–2005: Release of autobiography and first solo album ===
In 2000, Random House published Pope&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Anti Diva&quot;. The book included Pope&#x27;s first public acknowledgement that she had been in a relationship with British singer Dusty Springfield in the early 1980s. That year she and Staples contributed a track to the Dusty Springfield tribute album &quot;Forever Dusty: Homage to an Icon&quot;. Anti Diva also revealed fleeting 1970s dalliances with comic actress Andrea Martin and music producer Bob Ezrin. Years later, Pope discussed attending Dusty Springfield&#x27;s funeral where she spent time with the Pet Shop Boys, amongst other notables.

Soon afterwards, Pope re-recorded the Rough Trade single &quot;High School Confidential&quot; for the &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; season 1 soundtrack and appeared in the Toronto production of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in 2001. She would then move to New York City to continue writing and recording. In 2005, 21 years after her last EP, Pope returned to Los Angeles and released &quot;Transcend&quot;, her debut full-length solo album.

=== 2011–present: Second solo album, EP, and collaborations ===
In 2011, Pope released &quot;Landfall&quot;, her second full-length album, featuring a duet with Rufus Wainwright. That year she also was a guest vocalist on the album &quot;The Hills Are Alive&quot; by the Brooklyn Rundfunk Orkestrata.

Pope is an ambassador for the Harvey Milk School in New York City and a board director for the Songwriters Association of Canada. In 2015, Pope signed with Squirtgun Records (distributed by eOne Entertainment) to re-release the &quot;Music for Lesbians&quot; EP on 23 June 2015.

On 22 September 2017, Pope released the single, &quot;This Is Not A Test&quot;. An accompanying music video, directed by Jasun Mark, was released on 8 May 2018. Later that same year, Pope collaborated with keyboardist Kevin Hearn to release the single, &quot;Resist It&quot;, on 22 October 2018., which was later accompanied by a music video directed by Phillip Harder. A third single, &quot;I&#x27;m There&quot;, produced in collaboration with Spoons&#x27; keyboardist Rob Preuss, was released the following year.

In 2021, Pope collaborated with Ottawa band Church of Trees to release the song &quot;World&#x27;s A Bitch&quot;. Later that same year, Pope worked with Canadian performer Clara Venice to produce the single &quot;Speaking In Code&quot;. Venice had previously added her Theremin skills to Pope&#x27;s 2017 single, This Is Not A Test.

Pope served as a guest judge on the second episode of the third season of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; in 2022.

On July 21, 2023, it was revealed that a documentary based on Pope&#x27;s autobiography is currently in the works. The documentary, titled , is being funded by The Canada Media Fund. The production of the documentary is being handled by Gay Agenda, and it is scheduled to debut on CBC’s Documentary Channel in 2025.

== Personal life ==
Pope currently lives in Los Angeles, although she has previously resided in New York.

=== Health ===
In March 2018, Pope was forced to cancel a scheduled performance in Toronto due to a fractured ankle. Subsequently, she was compelled to cancel all of her scheduled performances for the remainder of the year due to mobility challenges that she had encountered during her tour. This ultimately resulted in a diagnosis of spinal stenosis. In order to assist with her living expenses following surgery, a fundraiser was established on GoFundMe.

<text>The term PLOKTA (sometimes rendered in lowercase, plokta) /plok&#x27;t*/ is an acronym for &quot;Press Lots Of Keys To Abort&quot;, and essentially means pressing random keys in an attempt to get some response from a (computer) system.

One might plokta when the abort procedure for a program is not known, or when trying to figure out if the system is just sluggish or really hung. Plokta can also be used while trying to figure out any unknown key sequence for a particular operation. Someone going into &quot;plokta mode&quot; usually places both hands flat on the keyboard and mashes them down, hoping for some useful response. This will sometimes eventually result in beeping sounds from an unresponding computer as its keyboard buffer fills up.

A slightly more directed form of plokta could often be seen in email messages or Usenet articles from new users with terminal-based clients - the text might end with 
 ^X^C
 q
 quit
 :q
 :q!
 ^C
 end
 x
 exit
 ZZ
 ^D
 help
as the user vainly tries to find the right exit sequence, with the incorrect tries piling up at the end of the message.</text><links>

<text>Wilmslow Road is a major road in Manchester, England, running from Parrs Wood northwards to Rusholme where it becomes the Oxford Road. The name of the road changes again to Oxford Street when it crosses the River Medlock before reaching Manchester city centre. 
The road runs through the centres of Didsbury, Withington and Fallowfield, including the major student residential campus of Owens Park, to Rusholme. Oxford Road passes through the University of Manchester campus, the Institute for Contemporary Theatre campus of BIMM University and the All Saints campus of the Manchester Metropolitan University. Several hospitals including the Christie Hospital and Manchester Royal Infirmary have been built along the road. It also features several parks and gardens such as Fletcher Moss Gardens, Platt Fields and Whitworth Park.

The road is part of a major bus corridor with bus movements of over one a minute at peak times and is a key centre for business, culture and higher education. 

==Route==

Wilmslow Road, Oxford Road and Oxford Street are part of an 18th-century route from Manchester to Oxford, and from there to Southampton, which can be traced on modern maps by locating roads which are called (or used to be called) the A34. Wilmslow Road was designated the A34 until 1967. Many sections of the route have been re-designated when motorways and bypasses took the A34 away from its original route and they took names such as the A3400 and A44. The ancient route goes via Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme, Wilmslow, Congleton, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stafford, Birmingham, Stratford-upon-Avon and Woodstock.

===Boundaries and designations===
Oxford Road and Oxford Street are the continuation of Wilmslow Road into the centre of Manchester. Oxford Street begins at St Peter&#x27;s Square and the name changes from Oxford Street to Oxford Road as the road crosses the River Medlock , placing Oxford Road railway station closer to Oxford Street than Oxford Road. Wilmslow Road starts at the junction with Hathersage Road and continues to Parrs Wood where it crosses the ancient county boundary into Cheshire. It crosses the River Mersey over the Cheadle Bridge into Cheadle. Its route is then called Manchester Road for a short time but there is a Wilmslow Road on the other side of Cheadle.

Oxford Street and a section of Oxford Road together form part of the A34. The B5117 consists of part of Oxford Road and part of Wilmslow Road. Though a continuous thoroughfare, part of Wilmslow Road also contains part of the A6010, the whole of the B5093, part of the A5145 and the whole of the B5095.

==History==

===Turnpike trust===
In 1753, the Manchester and Wilmslow Turnpike Trust was created by Act of Parliament, with powers to build, maintain, and improve the most northerly stretch of the Manchester to Oxford route, funded by the collection of tolls. In 1755 the trust built the first stone bridge over the Mersey. This collapsed in 1756 and was rebuilt in 1758. The bridge was replaced in 1780 and again in 1861.

The improved transport links spurred the development of villages such as Rusholme and Withington along the route. These villages eventually merged and became part of the city of Manchester. Chorlton-on-Medlock, the district nearest the town centre, was developed as a residential suburb in 1793–94 by the three landowners. Most of the important streets were given impressive names, Oxford Street, Cambridge Street and Grosvenor Street being three of these. Over the next fifty years residential development spread southwards as far as High Street (the old name of Hathersage Road). The very few remaining dwellings of that period include Waterloo Place, 323, 325, 327 and 333 Oxford Road and Grove House (316–324).
In 1861 the turnpike trust was threatened with abolition but survived by offering to build Palatine Road from Withington to West Didsbury. All turnpike trusts in the United Kingdom were abolished by 1881. Until some time in the 1880s all of Oxford Road and Oxford Street was called &quot;Oxford Street&quot; (as far south as High Street). The present street and road with different series of house numbers were introduced so that Oxford Street ended at the old township border of the River Medlock. The Chorlton-on-Medlock section became Oxford Road and from Rusholme to Parrs Wood remained Wilmslow Road.

===Trams===
Horse-drawn omnibuses operated along Wilmslow Road from before 1850. In 1877 the Rusholme Board of Health gained Parliamentary approval to lay tramlines. The trams were horse drawn and operated by the Manchester Carriage Company. Rusholme was incorporated into the City of Manchester in 1885. The city electrified the route in December 1902 and operated the new trams. The Tram Sheds, a feature of Wilmslow Road at the time were no longer needed and became a riding school and later the Rusholme Theatre.

===Congestion===
Kingsway was constructed in stages, from 1928, and completed in 1930. It was built as relief road to ease congestion on Wilmslow Road to the west. It was named after King George V and was originally numbered A5079. It was one of the earliest purpose-built roads especially for motor vehicles, and built as a dual carriageway. In 1959, it was extended south across the River Mersey to bypass Cheadle and later renumbered to become the A34 in 1967.

===Bus corridor===

Wilmslow Road is reputed to be the busiest bus corridor in Europe. Several bus companies operate services along all or part of the corridor, competing for the large numbers of passengers who use the route. The main operators are Stagecoach Manchester (along with its low cost brand Magic Bus) and First Greater Manchester. Other buses along sections of route are provided by companies including Arriva North West and Bullocks Coaches. The number of competing companies has reduced in recent years, as since bus deregulation in 1986 it had been common for four or five different operators to run services along the length of the route at any one time.

The bus corridor is popular with passengers for its frequent bus services, relatively low fares, and services that run at any hour of the day. Other factors responsible for the high patronage include the high density of students and the notable public facilities that can be found along the route. Wilmslow Road is designated a &quot;Quality Bus Corridor&quot; by Transport for Greater Manchester.

=== Oxford Road Corridor ===
The Oxford Road Corridor innovation district is a square mile in the south of Manchester&#x27;s city centre where two of the UK&#x27;s largest universities, the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University, are based alongside Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust. These organisations oversee the area in a partnership incorporated in 2007 alongside Manchester City Council and Bruntwood.

In 2015, The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) invited consortia, formed around geographic and technological themes, to apply to be involved in the science and innovation audit (SIA) process. The Greater Manchester and East Cheshire SIA highlighted that 50% of the City Region&#x27;s science and innovation assets were located in the Oxford Road Corridor. Recognising the region&#x27;s ‘Core Strengths’ in Health Innovation and Advanced Materials, and ‘Fast Growth Opportunities’ focused on the future potential of Digital, Energy, and Industrial Biotechnology.

In 2018, Manchester City Council adopted a Strategic Spatial Framework for the Oxford Road Corridor to guide future development and protect the area&#x27;s unique innovation eco-system.

The Oxford Road Corridor is home to a wide concentration of public, private, academic, and clinical institutions, generating 20% of Manchester&#x27;s GVA and providing 79,000 jobs. It is home to 50% of Manchester&#x27;s life sciences businesses, 74,000 students including 16,220 international students, with 42% of all students studying STEM related disciplines. Property companies Bruntwood and Bruntwood SciTech have invested significantly into assets in the area, acquiring the Manchester Technology Centre in 2003 and developing Manchester Science Park, and Citylabs both of which have designated Life Sciences Enterprise Zone status, and Circle Square which is home to over 35 digital tech businesses including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Northcoders, Blair Project and Tootoot.

The Oxford Road Corridor partnership shapes the direction of Oxford Road, using cultural activity to animate the area such as 2021&#x27;s Corridor of Light.

==Theatres and cinemas==
Prince&#x27;s Theatre was a theatre in Oxford Street from 1864 to 1940. It was built on a site on the corner of Lower Mosley Street by the architect Edward Salomons for the theatrical manager Charles Alexander Calvert. The theatre was the scene of a series of public-spirited dramatic enterprises, including those remarkable Shakespearean revivals organised successively by John Knowles and Charles Calvert. Later it became known for its pantomimes, from the mid-1890s until 1914. By the 1930s, it was in some financial difficulty and closed in 1940. After demolition and many years of delay the office block of Peter House was built on the site.

The Palace Theatre on the junction of Whitworth Street opened in 1891.

The Hippodrome, designed by Frank Matcham for Sir Oswald Stoll, was a 3,000-seat theatre built on the corner of Great Bridgewater Street, on part of the site of Hengler&#x27;s Grand Cirque, and opened in December 1904. In 1934, it started showing films but the theatre was sold to Granada Theatres and closed in February 1935. The Hippodrome was demolished and replaced in October 1935 by the Theodore Komisarjevsky-designed 2,300-seat Gaumont, who acquired it from Granada shortly before opening. It was the grandest of Manchester&#x27;s cinemas with a fine theatre organ. Norman Cocker was a notable organist there. After its eventual closure in January 1974 it was converted into Rotters nightclub and operated under several names until its closure in 1990. It was demolished and replaced by a NCP car park.

Other cinemas which have existed in Oxford Street, Oxford Road or Wilmslow Road are:

* Cornerhouse at no. 70, either side of Station Approach; Cornerhouse 1 was opened as the Tatler News Theatre in May 1935 designed by Peter Cummings. It closed in September 1959 and reopened as the Tatler Classic in November 1961. It was renamed the Tatler Cinema Club in 1969 and closed in August 1981 before the establishment of Cornerhouse with three cinemas in 1985. The Cornerhouse closed in 2015.
* Grosvenor Picture Palace was on the corner of Oxford Road and Grosvenor Street from 1915 to 1968 and is now the Footage pub.
* Manchester News Theatre on the corner of Hall Street was also designed by Peter Cummings and opened in December 1936. It became known as the Tatler Theatre until it closed in September 1967. It reopened as the Manchester Film Theatre from October 1967 to April 1973. It reopened again in August 1973 and later became the Cameo Cinema until it was demolished in 1981.
* New Oxford Cinema built by Provincial Cinematograph Theatres on the corner of Chepstow Street, next to the Hippodrome, opened in 1911. The opening programme on 15 December 1911 included footage of Captain Scott&#x27;s Antarctic expedition. On the next day the cinema opened to the public and before long became known as the Oxford Picture House and in 1927 was renamed first the Oxford Theatre and four months later the New Oxford Theatre. By 1930 it was owned by the European Motion Picture Company Ltd and in 1949 was acquired by the Buxton Theatre Circuit. A wide screen was installed in 1954 and after a period of stiff competition with the two Rank cinemas in the street the New Oxford was taken over by the Rank Organisation in June 1960. After Rank introduced two and then three screens to the Odeon the New Oxford closed on 25 October 1980. After closure part of the ground floor was converted into a McDonald&#x27;s fast food restaurant. 
* Paramount Theatre was a 2,920-seat theatre opened in October 1930 opposite the Hippodrome. It was acquired by Odeon Cinemas in 1939 and reopened in 1940. It once had a fine theatre organ. It closed in 1973 to be converted into a two screen multiplex in January 1974 and converted into a triplex in 1979 and added four more screens in 1992. It closed in September 2004
* Regal Twins - Built in 1929-30 originally containing two large meeting halls over a parade of shops, before the interior of the halls was completed, they were converted into two cinemas with fashionable 1930 Art Deco interiors, the world&#x27;s first multiplex in 1930. These were converted in 1972, to a five-screen complex (Studios 1 to 5) by Star Group, as the first five-cinema complex in Britain, before closing in the 1980s. In 1994 it became the Dancehouse Theatre.
*The Scala Cinema was on Wilmslow Road in Withington from 1912 to 2001.

<text>The Gunnison River is located in western Colorado, United States and is one of the largest tributaries of the Colorado River.

==Description==

The river flows east to west and has a drainage area of according to the USGS. The drainage basin of the Gunnison collects water from different habitats, such as forests and alpine meadows, located along the Continental Divide. As the river flows westward, it carves through the San Juan Mountains. It flows into the Colorado River at Grand Junction.

The Gunnison River Basin is popular for recreational activities such as fishing, rafting, boating, camping, hiking, and rock climbing.

Contamination of the Gunnison River with selenium and mercury results from irrigation of high-selenium soils derived from the Mancos Shale and from mineral mining. The region surrounding the Gunnison River is part of the Colorado Mineral Belt. Contamination of the Gunnison River with selenium and mercury is a conservation concern for the bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, humpback chub, and razorback sucker, whose critical habitat includes the lower Gunnison River.

==Basin features==

The Gunnison River is formed by the confluence of the Taylor and East rivers at Almont in eastern Gunnison County, Colorado. Just past the town of Gunnison, the river begins to swell into the expanse of Blue Mesa Reservoir, a reservoir formed by Blue Mesa Dam, where it receives the Lake Fork of the Gunnison. Just downstream, it is dammed again to form Morrow Point Reservoir and then dammed again to form Crystal Reservoir. The reservoirs produce hydroelectric power and supply the surrounding areas with water for both municipal and irrigation use. The reservoirs are located along the upper part of the Gunnison River. Below Crystal Dam, the Gunnison River begins to roar through massive cataracts.

The Gunnison River then flows through the Black Canyon of the Gunnison, one of the longest, narrowest, and deepest gorges in the world. At the outlet of the Black Canyon, it receives the North Fork River, and then downstream, near Delta, it is joined by the Uncompahgre River. It then winds through desert canyonlands, where it receives Kannah Creek. It then empties out of the Dominguez Canyon into the Colorado River at Grand Junction, where some years it rivals the Colorado River in volume.

The Gunnison River ranges in width from and in depth from . The river&#x27;s powerful current and many rapids make upstream travel nearly impossible. It is navigable by small craft throughout its course and by larger boats below the Black Canyon. Parts of the Black Canyon are non-navigable by any sort of craft because of giant cataracts. Navigation through the entire canyon is dangerous and for experienced boaters only.

==History==
The first non-native to see and record information of the Gunnison River was Juan Maria de Rivera, who came to the banks of the river just below its confluence with the Uncompahgre River in 1761 and 1765. It was again seen in 1776 by Silvestre Vélez de Escalante. At the time the Spanish name for the river was &quot;Rio de San Javier (Xavier)&quot;; the Native American name was &quot;Tomichi&quot;. Escalante noted that Rivera thought it was &quot;the great Rio del Tizon&quot;, the long-used Spanish name for the lower Colorado River.

Through the mid-1800s, the river was variously named the Eagle, Eagle Tail, South Fork of the Grand, Grande, and Grand River. Exploration reports and published maps of the 1850s and 1860s most commonly referred to the river as the Grand River. In subsequent years, however, the river was renamed for U.S. Army Captain John W. Gunnison of the Topographic Engineers, who was ambushed and killed by Pahvant Utes while mapping a trail west in Utah Territory in 1853.

==Fishing==
The lower section of the Gunnison River is designated as Gold Medal Water and Wild Trout Water. The fishing is very good and stretches for miles. The designated area begins 200 yards below the Crystal Dam and stretches through the Black Canyon to the confluence of the North Fork and Gunnison rivers.

==Engineering==
Part of the river&#x27;s water is diverted to irrigate the Uncompahgre Valley via the Gunnison Tunnel, which was built between 1905 and 1909. The Blue Mesa Dam, Morrow Point Dam, and Crystal Dam–built between the 1960s and the 1970s–are part of the Colorado River Storage Project.

== Timeline of river development and management projects ==
=== Past ===
Throughout the late 19th and early 20th century the Bureau of Reclamation built multiple dams (Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal) and reservoirs (Blue Mesa, Morrow Point, and Crystal). All of these projects provided the area with large amounts of water which supported local agriculture, recreation, and other industries. Development of the Gunnison River prompted concerns from those wanting to preserve the scenic beauty of the river (especially the Black Canyon of the Gunnison). In the 1930s President Herbert Hoover designated the Black Canyon of the Gunnison River a national monument in order to protect &quot;the roar of the river&quot;. By the end of the 20th century the Black Canyon received more protections when Congress declared the canyon a national park.

=== Present ===
In 2008 the Black Canyon Decree was passed which resolved legal disputes over water resources in Colorado and protect the Black Canyon of the Gunnison. The decree set a flow regime that &quot;will protect the water-dependent resources of the Black Canyon and help restore the ecological balance in the river system disrupted by three federal dams immediately upstream of the Park.&quot; The condition of the Gunnison River continues to improve with increased protections for Black Canyon National Park and as stakeholders, scientists, and natural resource managers continue their efforts to protect the Gunnison. Their efforts include conducting scientific research and publishing information that informs the general public how they can protect the river. According to a progress report from 2019, the Gunnison Basin Selenium Management Program continues its efforts to &quot;develop and implement a Selenium Management Program (SMP) in cooperation with the State of Colorado and Gunnison River basin water users to reduce adverse effects of selenium on endangered fish species in the Gunnison and Colorado rivers.&quot;

=== Future ===
The Gunnison River is threatened by climate change, demand for water resources, and ongoing challenges regarding selenium contamination. Because of these factors the future of the Gunnison River is uncertain.

== Ecosystem contamination ==
Selenium and mercury contamination of the Gunnison River results from irrigation of soils that are naturally high in selenium, mining activity, and atmospheric mercury deposition. Selenium and mercury contribute to concerns about conservation of resident biota. Four fish species - the humpback chub, bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, and the razorback sucker - are endemic to the region. Critical habitat for these species includes the lower Gunnison River. Elevated salinity concentrations are also a problem for the river and its users. Soils derived from the Mancos Shale, east of the Uncompahgre River, are naturally high in both selenium and salinity.

=== Selenium ===
Elevated selenium in the Gunnison River Basin reflects the underlying geology. The Gunnison River Basin sits atop the Mancos Shale which is naturally elevated in selenium. The seleniferous soil the shale produces have come to the subsurface due to weathering of the rock and uplift. Agricultural irrigation of seleniferous soils is one mechanism of selenium loading to the Gunnison River. As farmland in the Gunnison River Basin is abundant, the amount of selenium reaches well over the normal concentration in areas from Grand Junction to the tributaries in the upper Gunnison River. Some of the most concentrated tributaries of the Gunnison, namely the Uncompahgre, load large amounts of selenium to the Gunnison River. Selenium concentrations in the River can be as high as 11 ppm during peak times. Agricultural areas in the Gunnison River Basin are heavily farmed and provide large amounts of sediment during the growing months. Concentrations of selenium in the Gunnison River rise in April until they peak in August due to irrigation drainage. These peaks in selenium concentrations coincide with the reproduction events of the Colorado pikeminnow and the razorback sucker. High amounts of selenium are deposited into the yolk by the mother and juvenile fish eat algae that is highly concentrated with selenium in August. Effects of high selenium concentrations in fish include reduced oxygenation rates and lowered total energy capacity used for movement and reproduction, with fitness consequences for migratory fish such as the Colorado pikeminnow. Elevated selenium exposure can also cause malformations in adult fish.

=== Mercury ===
Mercury in the Gunnison River comes from human activities including surface mining and burning fossil fuels such as coal. As rain water is discharged, it transports mercury to the river where bacteria biotransform mercury into methylmercury. Methylmercury has no biological benefit but rather bioaccumulates and biomagnifies through the trophic levels of the Gunnison River ecosystem. These concentrations of mercury can be as high as 13% above thresholds set in place by the EPA. Humpback chub, bonytail chub, Colorado pikeminnow, and the razorback sucker are susceptible to elevated concentrations of mercury based on their long distance annual migrations to reproduce. The Colorado pikeminnow is especially vulnerable to high concentrations of mercury as its life cycle is relatively long and the distances they travel for migration are especially far.

== Remediation ==
Organizations throughout Colorado are collaborating on pollution remediation in the Gunnison River in order to increase habitat quality for the razorback sucker and the Colorado pikeminnow. Some of these organizations and plans include The Gunnison River Basin&#x27;s Selenium Management Plan, The Selenium Control Program, and the Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Gunnison Basin Selenium Management Program. These programs aim to minimize the impact of selenium and salinity as unhealthy amounts of salinity lead to lower reproduction rates of fish as well as problems with agriculture. Current remediation attempts have led to a 43% reduction of selenium concentrations since the 1980s but additional reductions are needed to ensure the safety of the ecosystem. These attempts include giving funding to farmers of the Gunnison River Basin to reduce the amount of sedimentation deposited back into the river and therefore lower the overall amount of selenium being loaded into the river via tributaries. Salinity is being addressed by implementing local investments into the water use infrastructure by converting old systems to direct pipeline and sprinklers to help reduce the amount of runoff into the Gunnison. By reducing the amount of runoff being directed into the Gunnison, less selenium has been deposited into the river by irrigation drainage. As climate change reduces stream flow in the Gunnison River, future concentrations of both selenium and mercury will continually rise. This has led water managers and stakeholders from the Gunnison River Basin to review options in order to reduce the impact of climate change. These plans for the future hope to strengthen the critical water infrastructure, reduce agriculture water shortages, and encourage the beneficial relationship between agricultural, environmental and recreational water uses. In addition, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund has awarded the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment almost $13 million for future research and development along with pollution control and mitigation attempts. Most recently, the Gunnison River will soon be evaluated by state water quality officials to determine if the improvement programs have been successful in reducing the selenium and salinity levels toxic to the endangered fish. If the selenium levels are above the 4.6 mg/L water quality standard, the Gunnison will be subject to reclassification.

<text>Jack DeJohnette (born August 9, 1942) is an American jazz drummer, pianist, and composer.

Known for his extensive work as leader and sideman for musicians including Charles Lloyd, Freddie Hubbard, Keith Jarrett, Bill Evans, John Abercrombie, Alice Coltrane, Sonny Rollins, Miles Davis, Joe Henderson, Michael Brecker, Pat Metheny, Herbie Hancock and John Scofield, DeJohnette was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame in 2007. He has won two Grammy Awards and been nominated for five others.

==Biography==
===Early life and musical beginnings===
DeJohnette was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Jack DeJohnette (1911–2011) and Eva Jeanette DeJohnette (née Wood, 1918–1984). Although of predominantly African-American heritage, he has stated that he has some Native American ancestry, specifically Seminole and Crow. He began his musical career as a pianist, studying from age four with Antoinette Rich, the leader of an all-female symphony orchestra in Chicago, and first playing professionally at the age of 14. When Jack was 13, he switched to drums and was taught drumming techniques from a local jazz drummer, Bobby Miller Jr, who lived in the same neighborhood. DeJohnette credits his uncle, Roy Wood Sr. (1915–1995), a Chicago disc jockey and vice president/co-founder of the National Black Network of Black Broadcasters, as his inspiration to play music.

DeJohnette played R&amp;B, hard bop, and avant-garde music in Chicago. He led his own groups in addition to playing with Richard Abrams, Roscoe Mitchell and other eventual core members of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (founded in 1965). He also occasionally performed with Sun Ra and his Arkestra, and later in New York as well. In the early 1960s, DeJohnette had the opportunity to sit in for three tunes with John Coltrane and his quintet, an early foray into playing with big-name jazz musicians.

In 1966 DeJohnette moved to New York City, where he became a member of the Charles Lloyd Quartet. A band that recognized the potential influence of rock and roll on jazz, Lloyd&#x27;s group was where DeJohnette first encountered pianist Keith Jarrett, who would work extensively with him throughout his career. However, DeJohnette left the group in early 1968, citing Lloyd&#x27;s deteriorating, &quot;flat&quot; playing as his main reason for leaving. While Lloyd&#x27;s band was where he received international recognition for the first time, it was not the only group DeJohnette played with during his early years in New York, as he also worked with groups including Jackie McLean, Abbey Lincoln, Betty Carter, and Bill Evans. DeJohnette joined Evans&#x27; trio in 1968, the same year the group headlined the Montreux Jazz Festival and produced the album &quot;Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival&quot;. In November 1968, he worked briefly with Stan Getz and his quartet, which led to his first recordings with Miles Davis.

===The Miles Davis years===
In 1969, DeJohnette left the Evans trio and replaced Tony Williams in Miles Davis&#x27;s live band. Davis had seen DeJohnette play many times, one of which was during a stint with Evans at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London in 1968, where he also first heard bassist Dave Holland. Davis recognized DeJohnette&#x27;s ability to combine the driving grooves associated with rock and roll with improvisational aspects associated with jazz.

DeJohnette was the primary drummer on &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. DeJohnette and the other musicians saw the &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; sessions as unstructured and fragmentary, but also innovative: &quot;As the music was being played, as it was developing, Miles would get new ideas ... He&#x27;d do a take, and stop, and then get an idea from what had just gone on before, and elaborate on it ... The recording of Bitches Brew was a stream of creative musical energy. One thing was flowing into the next, and we were stopping and starting all the time.&quot; While he was not the only drummer involved in the project, as Davis had also enlisted Billy Cobham, Don Alias, and Lenny White, DeJohnette was considered the leader of the rhythm section within the group. He played on the live albums that would follow the release of &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;, taken from concerts at the Fillmore East in New York and Fillmore West in San Francisco. These ventures were undertaken at the behest of Clive Davis, then president of Columbia Records.

DeJohnette continued to work with Davis for the next three years, which led to collaborations with other Davis band members John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, and Holland; he also drew Keith Jarrett into the band. DeJohnette contributed to such Davis albums as &quot;Live-Evil&quot; (1971), &quot;Jack Johnson&quot; (1971), and &quot;On the Corner&quot; (1972), along with sessions later released on the 1981 compilation album &quot;Directions&quot;. He left the Davis group in mid-1971, although he returned for several concerts through the rest of that year.

===Solo and bandleader in the 1970s and &#x27;80s===

DeJohnette&#x27;s first record, &quot;The DeJohnette Complex&quot;, was released in 1968; on the album, he played melodica as well as drums, often allowing his mentor, Roy Haynes, to sit behind the set. He also recorded, in the early 1970s, the albums &quot;Have You Heard&quot;, &quot;Sorcery&quot;, and &quot;Cosmic Chicken&quot;. He released these first four albums on either the Milestone or Prestige labels, and then switched to ECM for his next endeavors; ECM gave him a &quot;fertile platform&quot; for his &quot;atmospheric drumming and challenging compositions.&quot; He was also featured on &quot;First Light&quot;, an album by trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, released by CTI in 1971.

The musical freedom he had while recording for ECM offered DeJohnette many dates as a sideman and opportunities to start his own groups. He first formed the group Compost in 1972, but this was a short-lived endeavor, and DeJohnette cited the music as far too experimental to achieve commercial success. During this period, DeJohnette continued his career as a sideman as well, rejoining Stan Getz&#x27;s quartet from 1973 to October 1974, and also enticing Dave Holland to join Getz&#x27;s rhythm section. This stint briefly preceded the formation of the Gateway Trio, a group that DeJohnette helped form but did not lead. This group came directly out of DeJohnette&#x27;s time with Getz, as Holland joined him in this group along with guitarist John Abercrombie, both of whom would become associated with DeJohnette throughout his career. His next group effort was Directions, a group formed in 1976 featuring saxophonist Alex Foster, bassist Mike Richmond, and Abercrombie, showing the links between the members of the Gateway trio. This was another short-lived group, yet it led directly to the formation of DeJohnette&#x27;s next group, New Directions, which featured Abercrombie again on guitar along with Lester Bowie on trumpet and Eddie Gómez on bass. This group coexisted with another DeJohnette group, Special Edition, which was the first DeJohnette-led group to receive critical acclaim. This group also helped the careers of many lesser-known young horn players, as it had a rotating front line that included David Murray, Arthur Blythe, Chico Freeman, and John Purcell, among others.

During this period, especially with Special Edition, DeJohnette offered &quot;the necessary gravity to keep the horns in a tight orbit&quot; in his compositions while also treating his listeners to &quot;the expanded vocabulary of the avant-garde plus the discipline of traditional jazz compositions.&quot; DeJohnette&#x27;s work with Special Edition has been interrupted regularly by other projects, the most significant of which are his recordings in 1983 and tours from 1985 as a member of Keith Jarrett&#x27;s trio, which was totally devoted to playing jazz standards. The trio included his long-time compatriot Jarrett and bassist Gary Peacock, and all three have been members of the group for over 25 years.

At the start of the 1980s, DeJohnette played on the album &quot;80/81&quot; with Pat Metheny, Charlie Haden, Dewey Redman and Michael Brecker. In 1981, DeJohnette performed at the Woodstock Jazz Festival, held in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Creative Music Studio.

===1990s to the present===

DeJohnette continued to work with Special Edition into the 1990s, but did not limit himself to that. In 1990 he toured in a quartet consisting of himself, Herbie Hancock, Pat Metheny, and his long-time collaborator Holland, and released &quot;Parallel Realities&quot; with this group the same year. In 1992 he released a major collaborative record, &quot;Music for the Fifth World&quot;, which was inspired by studies with a Native American elder and brought him together musically with players like Vernon Reid and John Scofield. He had also, during the 1980s, resumed playing piano, which led to his 1994 tour as an unaccompanied pianist. He also began working again with Abercrombie and Holland, reviving the Gateway trio. In 1990, DeJohnette was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.

In 2004, he was nominated for a Grammy award for his work on Keith Jarrett&#x27;s live album &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot;, and continued to work with that group into 2005. In the next few years, DeJohnette would begin and lead three new projects, the first of which was the Latin Project consisting of percussionists Giovanni Hidalgo and Luisito Quintero, reedman Don Byron, pianist Edsel Gomez, and bassist Jerome Harris. The other two new projects were the Jack DeJohnette Quartet, featuring Harris again alongside Danilo Perez and John Patitucci, and the Trio Beyond, a tribute to DeJohnette&#x27;s friend Tony Williams and his trio Lifetime (consisting of Williams, Larry Young and John McLaughlin), featuring John Scofield and Larry Goldings. DeJohnette also founded his own label, Golden Beams Productions, in 2005. That same year, he released &quot;Music in the Key of Om&quot; on his new label, an electronic album which he created for relaxing and meditative purposes on which he played synthesizer and resonating bells, which was nominated for a Grammy in the Best New Age Album category.

DeJohnette continued to make albums as a leader and sideman throughout this period as well, one of which was &quot;The Elephant Sleeps But Still Remembers&quot;, a collaboration that documents the first meeting of DeJohnette and guitarist Bill Frisell in 2001 and led to another tour, with Frisell and Jerome Harris. The next year Trio Beyond released &quot;Saudades&quot;, a live recording of a concert commemorating Tony Williams in London in 2004. In 2008, DeJohnette toured with Bobby McFerrin, Chick Corea, and the Jarrett trio, and the next year won the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album with &quot;Peace Time&quot;. In 2010, he founded the Jack DeJohnette Group, featuring Rudresh Mahanthappa on alto saxophone, David Fiuczynski on double-neck guitar, George Colligan on keyboards and piano, and long-time associate Jerome Harris on electric and acoustic bass guitars.

In 2012, DeJohnette released &quot;Sound Travels&quot;, which included appearances by McFerrin, Quintero, Bruce Hornsby, Esperanza Spalding, Lionel Loueke, and Jason Moran. The same year, he was awarded an NEA Jazz Masters Fellowship for his &quot;significant lifetime contributions [which] have helped to enrich jazz and further the growth of the art form.&quot;

==Style==
DeJohnette&#x27;s style incorporates elements of jazz, free jazz, world music, and R&amp;B, contributing to him being one of the most highly regarded and in-demand drummers. Initially a traditional grip player, he later switched to matched grip due to a problem with tendinitis.

His drumming style has been called unique; one critic writes that he is not merely a drummer but a &quot;percussionist, colourist and epigrammatic commentator mediating the shifting ensemble densities&quot; and that &quot;his drumming is always part of the music&#x27;s internal construction.&quot; In a 2004 interview, &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine called DeJohnette&#x27;s drumming &quot;beyond technique.&quot;

DeJohnette calls himself an &quot;abstract thinker&quot; when it comes to soloing, saying that he puts &quot;more weight on the abstract than, &#x27;What were you thinking in bar 33?&#x27; I don&#x27;t like to think that way. I can do it, but I like to be more in the flow.&quot; In terms of what he feels when he plays, DeJohnette said that when he plays, he goes &quot;into an altered state, a different headspace. I plug into my higher self, into the cosmic library of ideas.&quot; He has remarked that he has to play with a lot of restraint when playing in Keith Jarrett&#x27;s trio, in order &quot;to play with the subtlety that the music requires.&quot;

Whilst DeJohnette is most famous and mostly active as a drummer, he is also a schooled pianist. He began studying piano at age four and later took piano lessons at the Chicago Conservatory of Music and played both as a pianist and as a drummer in his early career. Later on, he would return to the piano, releasing solo piano albums in 1985 and 2016 and touring as an unaccompanied pianist in 1994. He has also played piano, organ and synthesizer keyboard instruments on albums on which he plays as a drummer, e.g. on Pictures (1977) or on New Directions In Europe (live in concert in 1979, released 1980).

<text>Sorrento is a coastal town on the Mornington Peninsula approx. 100km south of Melbourne Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government area. Sorrento recorded a population of 2,013 at the 2021 census. Sorrento is known for its appealing weather, limestone buildings, and its world-class day-spas, which take advantage of the local water pressure to provide an unparalelled scrub. 

It is thought that the name &#x27;Sorrento&#x27; (after the Italian seaside town) was conferred upon what was known as Sullivans Bay when the area was first opened for housing development in 1869.

==History==

The Boonwurrung people occupied the area now known as the Mornington Peninsula for tens of thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The area now known as Sorrento is traditionally known to the Boonwurrung as &quot;Bullanatoolong&quot;.

In February 1802, Lieutenant John Murray of led the first British force to enter Port Phillip Bay. Murray chose to anchor &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; off what is now known as Sorrento Beach. On 17 February the crew landed ashore and were greeted by about 18 local Boonwurrung. The crew, with their dinners in hand, showed how they ate bread. While one of the crew was handing out bread to everyone, they were ambushed. In response, several Boonwurrung were shot at by musket fire, with three receiving likely mortal wounds. Murray then ordered grapeshot and round shot to be fired from the carronades aboard the ship at the fleeing men. This occurred at a place Murray named Bowen&#x27;s Point which is now referred to as the Western Sister headland on the Sorrento foreshore. After exploring the southern part of the bay, Murray formally took possession of the area on 8 March 1802 for King George III of Great Britain in a small ceremony at a place now known as the Point King Foreshore Reserve in Sorrento. A few days later Murray sailed out of the heads and returned to Sydney.

In 1803, the British returned and established a convict settlement under the command of Lieutenant Governor David Collins at the Eastern Sister headland of Sullivan Bay in Sorrento. The site became the first British settlement on mainland Australia outside of the Sydney region. Within a few months, the settlement of around 500 people was abandoned and subsequently moved to Hobart in Tasmania. The famous convict, William Buckley, escaped from the Collins Settlement and went on to live with Aboriginal people in the Geelong area for over thirty years.

The Collins Settlement in Sorrento saw the first magistrates&#x27; court, public hospital, postal service and government printing office to be established in the region later known as Victoria. The first Victorian wedding, christening and funeral services were also held at the Sullivan Bay site.

Sorrento Post Office opened on 10 January 1871; the heritage-listed Sorrento Post Office building (now used for retail and a cafe) dates from 1904 to 1905.

From the 1870&#x27;s actor and entrepreneur George Coppin who had a holiday home there invested heavily in making Sorrento a popular destination, through both transportation and accommodation. In 1874 he founded the Sorrento-Queenscliff Steam Navigation Company, which operated the paddle steamer &quot;Golden Crown&quot; between Port Melbourne, Sorrento and Queenscliff, making the town much more accessible, and built the Continental Hotel in 1875 on what was then called Ocean Amphitheatre Road (now Ocean Beach Road). Then in 1889 he founded a company that built a steam powered tram which ran between the ferry terminal and the back beach, where he built a large hotel, the Back Beach Palace, in 1890 (demolished 1965). The tram operated in the summer months, and out of peak periods became a horse tram, the line eventually closing in 1921. Through his efforts the town became a popular destination, with more hotels and holiday homes, sometimes quite grand, built into the early 20th century, as well as shops lining Ocean Beach Road. 

The town has a number of grand historic homes and hotels which date back to the 1860s, almost all of which have been constructed with local limestone. The Australia ICOMOS charter for the conservation of places of cultural significance in the practice of local heritage protection has listed 30 properties. Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Sorrento was built in 1877 using local limestone and the building, which is now classified by the National Trust of Australia, houses the Nepean Historical Society&#x27;s museum. Other notable limestone buildings still standing include: Sorrento Hotel (1872), Anglican Church (1875 nave, 1889 transept), Athenaeum Theatre (1894), Continental Hotel (1875), Whitehall Guest House (1904, on the bank beach). The Koonya Hotel and Morgans (both on the foreshore, currently known as Italico restaurant) were built by the Skelton/Clark family (1876). The sandstone Presbyterian Church was built around 1880. Ophir House, opposite the Masonic Lodge on Cooper Street was a smaller version of Whitehall (demolished).

The Sorrento Park, established in 1870, contains a variety of trees, including an Aleppo Pine grown from a seed of the Lone Pine of Gallipoli. Situated above the beach and overlooking the bay, Sorrento Park has a children&#x27;s playground, BBQ facilities, and public toilets.

The town continues to be a popular destination, with regular ferry services to Portsea and Queenscliff. 

==Population==

In the 2016 census, there were 1,592 people in Sorrento. 78.0% of people were born in Australia and 86.8% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.0%, Catholic 24.7% and Anglican 19.3%.

==Tourist attractions==

Charter fishing boats operate from Sorrento Pier. A regular ferry service links Sorrento with Queenscliff in summer.

==Sport==

The town has an Australian Rules football team, The Sorrento Sharks, competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League before winning flags in the PFA in 1929 and 1933, then the MPFL in 1935, 1953, 1964, 1969, 1979, 1980 then the MPNFL in 2004, 2008, 2010, 2011 (seniors and reserves) and 2012. Former St.Kilda footballer Troy Schwarze coached the four grand finals between 2008 and 2011, before Nick Claringbold took over for 2012 so Troy could follow his dream coaching St.Kilda&#x27;s mid-fielders at their new facility in Seaford and on match days. Troy played with Sorrento in about 9 matches during 2012 when not required in the AFL, and the finals series. Ben McCormack took over the captaincy from Dave Lawson when Dave was appointed coach at Crib Point 3 years ago.

The Sorrento Cricket Club, coached by former Melbourne CC player and mystic guru Nick Davern, also known as &quot;Tin Hat&quot;, competes in the Provincial Division of the Mornington Peninsula Cricket Association, having won the Sub-District in 1989/90 and 2002/03, District Division in 2005/2006. It also won senior premierships in the Southern Peninsula Cricket Association (1922-1965) six in succession between 1946/47 and 1951/52, under Bill Clark and Arthur Robertson (3 each), then again in 1955/56 under Jack Mullen and 1957/58 under Derek Minter. Its first and only Provincial First XI premiership was 1971/72 under ex-Northcote and Collingwood player Graham Burt. Forty years on, the seniors had their next opportunity in a Provincial Grand Final losing to rivals Baxter in 2011/12. Season 2012/13 looked promising with the inclusion of ex-Victorian batsman Nick Jewell who scored 3 centuries before the Christmas interval, going on to win the Club Championship with 706 runs and 7 catches, including an opening partnership with Jedd Falck of 205. A second consecutive grand final appearance failed. In 2010/2011 Ryan O&#x27;Connor became the first player to win the W. B. Wedgwood medal for Sorrento but it didn&#x27;t take long for the club to win another with Captain Anthony Blackwell winning in 2011/2012.

Season 2023/24 Sorrento Cricket Club have appointed former Victorian state player and Melbourne Stars player Sebastien Gotch and also recruited former Victorian U/17 &amp; U/19 player Luke Kranzbruhler in what shapes up to be an exciting season for the Sharks.

The original Macfarlan Reserve pavilion was erected in 1935 with a terraced grandstand upstairs. It was demolished and completely rebuilt in 1984 and re-opened as the Robert (Bob) Keegan pavilion in 1985. Several balconies have been added since. Plans exist to add a gymnasium when funds are available.

The Sorrento Tennis Club originally occupied the land beside the Museum and is a sunken garden today. It was relocated to its current site in the 1960s followed by the Scout Hall and fire track a decade or so later. Netball courts, a skate park and basketball stadium followed creating a single sports complex together with the lawn bowls rinks.

Golfers play at the course of the Sorrento Golf Club on Langford Road.

==Sorrento Cemetery==

Dame Nellie Melba sang to raise funds for cemetery gates which rusted over time and were taken down and dumped at the tip where they were souvenired and used as a garden ornament. Notable interments include Federal Senator John Button, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, Vin Heffernan, actor Sophie Heathcote, naturalist Edith Coleman, cricketer Shane Warne and Dame Zara Bate, the wife of former Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt who disappeared at nearby Cheviot Beach. Ronald Joseph Walker AC CBE was an Australian businessman best known for his work in managing sporting events. As well as serving as Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1974 to 1976.

<doc id="511547" wikidata="Q1133068" url="?curid=511547" title="Quantum dot">
<text>Quantum dots (QDs) or semiconductor nanocrystals are semiconductor particles a few nanometres in size with optical and electronic properties that differ from those of larger particles via quantum mechanical effects. They are a central topic in nanotechnology and materials science. When a quantum dot is illuminated by UV light, an electron in the quantum dot can be excited to a state of higher energy. In the case of a semiconducting quantum dot, this process corresponds to the transition of an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. The excited electron can drop back into the valence band releasing its energy as light. This light emission (photoluminescence) is illustrated in the figure on the right. The color of that light depends on the energy difference between the discrete energy levels of the quantum dot in the conduction band and the valence band.

In other words, a quantum dot can be defined as a structure on a semiconductor which is capable of confining electrons in three dimensions, in this way it is possible to obtain discrete energy levels. Basically, the quantum dots are little crystals but behave as individual atoms, and their properties can be manipulated.

Nanoscale materials with semiconductor properties tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. The confinement is similar to a three-dimensional particle in a box model. The quantum dot absorption and emission features correspond to transitions between discrete quantum mechanically allowed energy levels in the box that are reminiscent of atomic spectra. For these reasons, quantum dots are sometimes referred to as artificial atoms, emphasizing their bound and discrete electronic states, like naturally occurring atoms or molecules. It was shown that the electronic wave functions in quantum dots resemble the ones in real atoms.

Quantum dots have properties intermediate between bulk semiconductors and discrete atoms or molecules. Their optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs of 5–6 nm diameter emit longer wavelengths, with colors such as orange, or red. Smaller QDs (2–3 nm) emit shorter wavelengths, yielding colors like blue and green. However, the specific colors vary depending on the exact composition of the QD.

Potential applications of quantum dots include single-electron transistors, solar cells, LEDs, lasers, single-photon sources, second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, cell biology research, microscopy, and medical imaging. Their small size allows for some QDs to be suspended in solution, which may lead to their use in inkjet printing, and spin coating. They have been used in Langmuir–Blodgett thin films. These processing techniques result in less expensive and less time-consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.

== Core/shell and core/double-shell structures ==
Quantum dots are usually coated with organic capping ligands (typically with long hydrocarbon chains, such as oleic acid) to control growth, prevent aggregation, and to promote dispersion in solution. However, these organic coatings can lead to non-radiative recombination after photogeneration, meaning the generated charge carriers can be dissipated without photon emission (e.g. via phonons or trapping in defect states), which reduces fluorescent quantum yield, or the conversion efficiency of absorbed photons into emitted fluorescence. To combat this, a semiconductor layer can be grown surrounding the quantum dot core. Depending on the bandgaps of the core and shell materials, the fluorescent properties of the nanocrystals can be tuned. Furthermore, adjusting the thicknesses of each of the layers and overall size of the quantum dots can affect the photoluminescent emission wavelength — the quantum confinement effect tends to blueshift the emission spectra as the quantum dot decreases in size.
There are 4 major categories of quantum dot heterostructures: type I, inverse type I, type II, and inverse type II.

Type I quantum dots are composed of a semiconductor core encapsulated in a second semiconductor material with a larger bandgap, which can passivate non-radiative recombination sites at the surface of the quantum dots and improve quantum yield. Inverse type I quantum dots have a semiconductor layer with a smaller bandgap which leads to delocalized charge carriers in the shell. For type II and inverse type II dots, either the conduction or valence band of the core is located within the bandgap of the shell, which can lead to spatial separation of charge carriers in the core and shell. For all of these core/shell systems, the deposition of the outer layer can lead to potential lattice mismatch, which can limit the ability to grow a thick shell without reducing photoluminescent performance.

One such reason for the decrease in performance can be attributed to the physical strain being put on the lattice. In a case where ZnSe/ZnS (type I) and ZnSe/CdS (type II) quantum dots were being compared, the diameter of the uncoated ZnSe core (obtained using TEM) was compared to the capped core diameter (calculated via effective mass approximation model) [lattice strain source] to better understand the effect of core-shell strain. Type I heterostructures were found to induce compressive strain and “squeeze” the core, while the type II heterostructures had the effect of stretching the core under tensile strain. Because the fluorescent properties of quantum dots are dictated by nanocrystal size, induced changes in core dimensions can lead to shifting of emission wavelength, further proving why an intermediate semiconductor layer is necessary to rectify lattice mismatch and improve quantum yield.

One such core/double-shell system is the CdSe/ZnSe/ZnS nanocrystal. In a study comparing CdSe/ZnS and CdSe/ZnSe nanocrystals, the former was found to have PL yield 84% of the latter’s, due to a lattice mismatch. To study the double-shell system, after synthesis of the core CdSe nanocrystals, a layer of ZnSe was coated prior to the ZnS outer shell, leading to an improvement in fluorescent efficiency by 70%. Furthermore, the two additional layers were found to improve resistance of the nanocrystals against photo-oxidation, which can contribute to degradation of the emission spectra.

It is also standard for surface passivation techniques to be applied to these core/double-shell systems, as well. As mentioned above, oleic acid is one such organic capping ligand that is used to promote colloidal stability and control nanocrystal growth, and can even be used to initiate a second round of ligand exchange and surface functionalization. However, because of the detrimental effect organic ligands have on PL efficiency, further studies have been conducted to obtain all-inorganic quantum dots. In one such study, intensely luminescent all-inorganic nanocrystals (ILANs) were synthesized via a ligand exchange process which substituted metal salts for the oleic acid ligands, and were found to have comparable photoluminescent quantum yields to that of existing red- and green-emitting quantum dots.

== Production ==

There are several ways to fabricate quantum dots. Possible methods include colloidal synthesis, self-assembly, and electrical gating.

=== Colloidal synthesis ===
Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals are synthesized from solutions, much like traditional chemical processes. The main difference is the product neither precipitates as a bulk solid nor remains dissolved. Heating the solution at high temperature, the precursors decompose forming monomers which then nucleate and generate nanocrystals. Temperature is a critical factor in determining optimal conditions for the nanocrystal growth. It must be high enough to allow for rearrangement and annealing of atoms during the synthesis process while being low enough to promote crystal growth. The concentration of monomers is another critical factor that has to be stringently controlled during nanocrystal growth. The growth process of nanocrystals can occur in two different regimes: &quot;focusing&quot; and &quot;defocusing&quot;. At high monomer concentrations, the critical size (the size where nanocrystals neither grow nor shrink) is relatively small, resulting in growth of nearly all particles. In this regime, smaller particles grow faster than large ones (since larger crystals need more atoms to grow than small crystals) resulting in the size distribution &quot;focusing&quot;, yielding an improbable distribution of nearly monodispersed particles. The size focusing is optimal when the monomer concentration is kept such that the average nanocrystal size present is always slightly larger than the critical size. Over time, the monomer concentration diminishes, the critical size becomes larger than the average size present, and the distribution &quot;defocuses&quot;.

There are colloidal methods to produce many different semiconductors. Typical dots are made of binary compounds such as lead sulfide, lead selenide, cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, cadmium telluride, indium arsenide, and indium phosphide. Dots may also be made from ternary compounds such as cadmium selenide sulfide. Further, recent advances have been made which allow for synthesis of colloidal perovskite quantum dots.
These quantum dots can contain as few as 100 to 100,000 atoms within the quantum dot volume, with a diameter of approximately 10 to 50 atom diameters. This corresponds to about 2 to 10 nanometers, and at 10 nm in diameter, nearly 3 million quantum dots could be lined up end to end and fit within the width of a human thumb.

Large batches of quantum dots may be synthesized via colloidal synthesis. Due to this scalability and the convenience of benchtop conditions, colloidal synthetic methods are promising for commercial applications.

=== Plasma synthesis ===
Plasma synthesis has evolved to be one of the most popular gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots, especially those with covalent bonds. For example, silicon and germanium quantum dots have been synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be controlled in nonthermal plasma. Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in plasma synthesis. Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic solvents or water (i. e., colloidal quantum dots).

=== Fabrication ===
The electrostatic potential needed to create a quantum dot can be realized with several methods. These include external electrodes, doping, strain, or impurities. Self-assembled quantum dots are typically between 5 and 50 nm in size. Quantum dots defined by lithographically patterned gate electrodes, or by etching on two-dimensional electron gases in semiconductor heterostructures can have lateral dimensions between 20 and 100 nm.

The formation of quantum dots can be spontaneous when a semiconductor material is deposited on a substrate and a difference in lattice space exists between them.

By means of advanced nanofabrication technologies it is possible to manipulate properties of the quantum dots, such as their interactions, shape, size and transparency.

For example, when negative voltage is applied to a metal gate around a QD, as response, its diameter starts to be gradually squeezed, as a consequence, the number of electrons on the dot starts to decrease one by one, this could be made until there are no more left.

The previous property allows to record the current flow as the number of electrons on the dot, this implies that the energy variates.

*Some quantum dots are small regions of one material buried in another with a larger band gap. These can be so-called core–shell structures, for example, with CdSe in the core and ZnS in the shell, or from special forms of silica called ormosil. Sub-monolayer shells can also be effective ways of passivating the quantum dots, such as PbS cores with sub-monolayer CdS shells.
*Quantum dots sometimes occur spontaneously in quantum well structures due to monolayer fluctuations in the well&#x27;s thickness.

*Self-assembled quantum dots nucleate spontaneously under certain conditions during molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy (MOVPE), when a material is grown on a substrate to which it is not lattice matched. The resulting strain leads to the formation of islands on top of a two-dimensional wetting layer. This growth mode is known as Stranski–Krastanov growth. The islands can be subsequently buried to form the quantum dot. A widely used type of quantum dots grown with this method are indium gallium arsenide () quantum dots in gallium arsenide (). Such quantum dots have the potential for applications in quantum cryptography (that is, single-photon sources) and quantum computation. The main limitations of this method are the cost of fabrication and the lack of control over positioning of individual dots.
*Individual quantum dots can be created from two-dimensional electron or hole gases present in remotely doped quantum wells or semiconductor heterostructures called lateral quantum dots. The sample surface is coated with a thin layer of resist and a lateral pattern is then defined in the resist by electron beam lithography. This pattern can then be transferred to the electron or hole gas by etching, or by depositing metal electrodes (lift-off process) that allow the application of external voltages between the electron gas and the electrodes. Such quantum dots are mainly of interest for experiments and applications involving electron or hole transport and they are also used as spin qubits. A strength of this type of quantum dots is that their energy spectrum can be engineered by controlling the geometrical size, shape, and the strength of the confinement potential with gate electrodes. These quantum dots can be easily connected by tunnel barriers to conducting leads, which allows the application of the techniques of tunneling spectroscopy for their investigation.
* Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology can be employed to fabricate silicon quantum dots. Ultra small (20 nm × 20 nm) CMOS transistors behave as single electron quantum dots when operated at cryogenic temperature over a range of −269 °C (4 K) to about −258 °C (15 K). The transistor displays Coulomb blockade due to progressive charging of electrons (holes) one by one. The number of electrons (holes) confined in the channel is driven by the gate voltage, starting from an occupation of zero electrons (holes), and it can be set to one or many.

=== Viral assembly ===
Genetically engineered M13 bacteriophage viruses allow preparation of quantum dot biocomposite structures. It had previously been shown that genetically engineered viruses can recognize specific semiconductor surfaces through the method of selection by combinatorial phage display. Additionally, it is known that liquid crystalline structures of wild-type viruses (Fd, M13, and TMV) are adjustable by controlling the solution concentrations, solution ionic strength, and the external magnetic field applied to the solutions. Consequently, the specific recognition properties of the virus can be used to organize inorganic nanocrystals, forming ordered arrays over the length scale defined by liquid crystal formation. Using this information, Lee et al. (2000) were able to create self-assembled, highly oriented, self-supporting films from a phage and ZnS precursor solution. This system allowed them to vary both the length of bacteriophage and the type of inorganic material through genetic modification and selection.

=== Electrochemical assembly ===
Highly ordered arrays of quantum dots may also be self-assembled by electrochemical techniques. A template is created by causing an ionic reaction at an electrolyte–metal interface which results in the spontaneous assembly of nanostructures, including quantum dots, onto the metal which is then used as a mask for mesa-etching these nanostructures on a chosen substrate.

=== Bulk manufacture ===
Quantum dot manufacturing relies on a process called &quot;high temperature dual injection&quot; which has been scaled by multiple companies for commercial applications that require large quantities (hundreds of kilograms to tons) of quantum dots. This reproducible production method can be applied to a wide range of quantum dot sizes and compositions.

The bonding in certain cadmium-free quantum dots, such as III–V-based quantum dots, is more covalent than that in II–VI materials, therefore it is more difficult to separate nanoparticle nucleation and growth via a high temperature dual injection synthesis. An alternative method of quantum dot synthesis, the &quot;molecular seeding&quot; process, provides a reproducible route to the production of high-quality quantum dots in large volumes. The process utilises identical molecules of a molecular cluster compound as the nucleation sites for nanoparticle growth, thus avoiding the need for a high temperature injection step. Particle growth is maintained by the periodic addition of precursors at moderate temperatures until the desired particle size is reached. The molecular seeding process is not limited to the production of cadmium-free quantum dots; for example, the process can be used to synthesise kilogram batches of high-quality II–VI quantum dots in just a few hours.

Another approach for the mass production of colloidal quantum dots can be seen in the transfer of the well-known hot-injection methodology for the synthesis to a technical continuous flow system. The batch-to-batch variations arising from the needs during the mentioned methodology can be overcome by utilizing technical components for mixing and growth as well as transport and temperature adjustments. For the production of CdSe based semiconductor nanoparticles this method has been investigated and tuned to production amounts of kilograms per month. Since the use of technical components allows for easy interchange in regards of maximum throughput and size, it can be further enhanced to tens or even hundreds of kilograms.

In 2011 a consortium of U.S. and Dutch companies reported a milestone in high-volume quantum dot manufacturing by applying the traditional high temperature dual injection method to a flow system.

On 23 January 2013 Dow entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with UK-based Nanoco for the use of their low-temperature molecular seeding method for bulk manufacture of cadmium-free quantum dots for electronic displays, and on 24 September 2014 Dow commenced work on the production facility in South Korea capable of producing sufficient quantum dots for &quot;millions of cadmium-free televisions and other devices, such as tablets&quot;. Mass production was due to commence in mid-2015. On 24 March 2015, Dow announced a partnership deal with LG Electronics to develop the use of cadmium free quantum dots in displays.

== Health and safety ==
Some quantum dots pose risks to human health and the environment under certain conditions. Notably, the studies on quantum dot toxicity have focused on particles containing cadmium and have yet to be demonstrated in animal models after physiologically relevant dosing. In vitro studies, based on cell cultures, on quantum dots (QD) toxicity suggest that their toxicity may derive from multiple factors including their physicochemical characteristics (size, shape, composition, surface functional groups, and surface charges) and their environment. Assessing their potential toxicity is complex as these factors include properties such as QD size, charge, concentration, chemical composition, capping ligands, and also on their oxidative, mechanical, and photolytic stability.

Many studies have focused on the mechanism of QD cytotoxicity using model cell cultures. It has been demonstrated that after exposure to ultraviolet radiation or oxidation by air, CdSe QDs release free cadmium ions causing cell death. Group II–VI QDs also have been reported to induce the formation of reactive oxygen species after exposure to light, which in turn can damage cellular components such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. Some studies have also demonstrated that addition of a ZnS shell inhibits the process of reactive oxygen species in CdSe QDs. Another aspect of QD toxicity is that there are, in vivo, size-dependent intracellular pathways that concentrate these particles in cellular organelles that are inaccessible by metal ions, which may result in unique patterns of cytotoxicity compared to their constituent metal ions. The reports of QD localization in the cell nucleus present additional modes of toxicity because they may induce DNA mutation, which in turn will propagate through future generation of cells, causing diseases.

Although concentration of QDs in certain organelles have been reported in in vivo studies using animal models, no alterations in animal behavior, weight, hematological markers, or organ damage has been found through either histological or biochemical analysis. These findings have led scientists to believe that intracellular dose is the most important determining factor for QD toxicity. Therefore, factors determining the QD endocytosis that determine the effective intracellular concentration, such as QD size, shape, and surface chemistry determine their toxicity. Excretion of QDs through urine in animal models also have demonstrated via injecting radio-labeled ZnS-capped CdSe QDs where the ligand shell was labeled with 99mTc. Though multiple other studies have concluded retention of QDs in cellular levels, exocytosis of QDs is still poorly studied in the literature.

While significant research efforts have broadened the understanding of toxicity of QDs, there are large discrepancies in the literature, and questions still remain to be answered. Diversity of this class of material as compared to normal chemical substances makes the assessment of their toxicity very challenging. As their toxicity may also be dynamic depending on the environmental factors such as pH level, light exposure, and cell type, traditional methods of assessing toxicity of chemicals such as LD50 are not applicable for QDs. Therefore, researchers are focusing on introducing novel approaches and adapting existing methods to include this unique class of materials. Furthermore, novel strategies to engineer safer QDs are still under exploration by the scientific community. A recent novelty in the field is the discovery of carbon quantum dots, a new generation of optically active nanoparticles potentially capable of replacing semiconductor QDs, but with the advantage of much lower toxicity.

== Optical properties ==
Quantum dots have been gaining interest from the scientific community because of their interesting optical properties, the main being band gap tunability. When an electron is excited to the conduction band, it leaves behind a vacancy in the valence band called hole. These two opposite charges are bound by Coulombic interactions in what is called an exciton and their spatitial separation is defined by the exciton Bohr radius. In a nanostructure of comparable size to the exciton Bohr radius, the exciton is physically confined within the semiconductor resulting in an increase of the band gap of the material. This dependence can be predicted using the Brus model.

As the confinement energy depends on the quantum dot&#x27;s size, both absorption onset and fluorescence emission can be tuned by changing the size of the quantum dot during its synthesis. The larger the dot, the redder (lower-energy) its absorption onset and fluorescence spectrum. Conversely, smaller dots absorb and emit bluer (higher-energy) light. Recent articles suggest that the shape of the quantum dot may be a factor in the coloration as well, but as yet not enough information is available . Furthermore, it was shown that the lifetime of fluorescence is determined by the size of the quantum dot. Larger dots have more closely spaced energy levels in which the electron–hole pair can be trapped. Therefore, electron–hole pairs in larger dots live longer causing larger dots to show a longer lifetime.

To improve fluorescence quantum yield, quantum dots can be made with &quot;shells&quot; of a larger bandgap semiconductor material around them. The improvement is suggested to be due to the reduced access of electron and hole to non-radiative surface recombination pathways in some cases, but also due to reduced Auger recombination in others.

== Applications ==
Quantum dots are particularly promising for optical applications due to their high extinction coefficient and ultrafast optical nonlinearities with potential applications for developing all-optical systems. They operate like a single-electron transistor and show the Coulomb blockade effect. Quantum dots have also been suggested as implementations of qubits for quantum information processing, and as active elements for thermoelectrics.

Tuning the size of quantum dots is attractive for many potential applications. For instance, larger quantum dots have a greater spectrum shift toward red compared to smaller dots and exhibit less pronounced quantum properties. Conversely, the smaller particles allow one to take advantage of more subtle quantum effects.
Being zero-dimensional, quantum dots have a sharper density of states than higher-dimensional structures. As a result, they have superior transport and optical properties. They have potential uses in diode lasers, amplifiers, and biological sensors. Quantum dots may be excited within a locally enhanced electromagnetic field produced by gold nanoparticles, which then can be observed from the surface plasmon resonance in the photoluminescent excitation spectrum of (CdSe)ZnS nanocrystals. High-quality quantum dots are well suited for optical encoding and multiplexing applications due to their broad excitation profiles and narrow/symmetric emission spectra. The new generations of quantum dots have far-reaching potential for the study of intracellular processes at the single-molecule level, high-resolution cellular imaging, long-term in vivo observation of cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and diagnostics.

CdSe nanocrystals are efficient triplet photosensitizers. Laser excitation of small CdSe nanoparticles enables the extraction of the excited state energy from the quantum dots into bulk solution, thus opening the door to a wide range of potential applications such as photodynamic therapy, photovoltaic devices, molecular electronics, and catalysis.

=== Biology ===
In modern biological analysis, various kinds of organic dyes are used. However, as technology advances, greater flexibility in these dyes is sought. To this end, quantum dots have quickly filled in the role, being found to be superior to traditional organic dyes on several counts, one of the most immediately obvious being brightness (owing to the high extinction coefficient combined with a comparable quantum yield to fluorescent dyes) as well as their stability (allowing much less photobleaching). It has been estimated that quantum dots are 20 times brighter and 100 times more stable than traditional fluorescent reporters. For single-particle tracking, the irregular blinking of quantum dots is a minor drawback. However, there have been groups which have developed quantum dots which are essentially nonblinking and demonstrated their utility in single-molecule tracking experiments.

The use of quantum dots for highly sensitive cellular imaging has seen major advances. The improved photostability of quantum dots, for example, allows the acquisition of many consecutive focal-plane images that can be reconstructed into a high-resolution three-dimensional image. Another application that takes advantage of the extraordinary photostability of quantum dot probes is the real-time tracking of molecules and cells over extended periods of time. Antibodies, streptavidin, peptides, DNA, nucleic acid aptamers, or small-molecule ligands can be used to target quantum dots to specific proteins on cells. Researchers were able to observe quantum dots in lymph nodes of mice for more than 4 months.

Quantum dots can have antibacterial properties similar to nanoparticles and can kill bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. One mechanism by which quantum dots can kill bacteria is through impairing the functions of antioxidative system in the cells and down regulating the antioxidative genes. In addition, quantum dots can directly damage the cell wall. Quantum dots have been shown to be effective against both gram- positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Semiconductor quantum dots have also been employed for in vitro imaging of pre-labeled cells. The ability to image single-cell migration in real time is expected to be important to several research areas such as embryogenesis, cancer metastasis, stem cell therapeutics, and lymphocyte immunology.

One application of quantum dots in biology is as donor fluorophores in Förster resonance energy transfer, where the large extinction coefficient and spectral purity of these fluorophores make them superior to molecular fluorophores It is also worth noting that the broad absorbance of QDs allows selective excitation of the QD donor and a minimum excitation of a dye acceptor in FRET-based studies. The applicability of the FRET model, which assumes that the Quantum Dot can be approximated as a point dipole, has recently been demonstrated

The use of quantum dots for tumor targeting under in vivo conditions employ two targeting schemes: active targeting and passive targeting. In the case of active targeting, quantum dots are functionalized with tumor-specific binding sites to selectively bind to tumor cells. Passive targeting uses the enhanced permeation and retention of tumor cells for the delivery of quantum dot probes. Fast-growing tumor cells typically have more permeable membranes than healthy cells, allowing the leakage of small nanoparticles into the cell body. Moreover, tumor cells lack an effective lymphatic drainage system, which leads to subsequent nanoparticle accumulation.

Quantum dot probes exhibit in vivo toxicity. For example, CdSe nanocrystals are highly toxic to cultured cells under UV illumination, because the particles dissolve, in a process known as photolysis, to release toxic cadmium ions into the culture medium. In the absence of UV irradiation, however, quantum dots with a stable polymer coating have been found to be essentially nontoxic. Hydrogel encapsulation of quantum dots allows for quantum dots to be introduced into a stable aqueous solution, reducing the possibility of cadmium leakage. Then again, only little is known about the excretion process of quantum dots from living organisms.

In another potential application, quantum dots are being investigated as the inorganic fluorophore for intra-operative detection of tumors using fluorescence spectroscopy.

Delivery of undamaged quantum dots to the cell cytoplasm has been a challenge with existing techniques. Vector-based methods have resulted in aggregation and endosomal sequestration of quantum dots while electroporation can damage the semi-conducting particles and aggregate delivered dots in the cytosol. Via cell squeezing, quantum dots can be efficiently delivered without inducing aggregation, trapping material in endosomes, or significant loss of cell viability. Moreover, it has shown that individual quantum dots delivered by this approach are detectable in the cell cytosol, thus illustrating the potential of this technique for single-molecule tracking studies.

=== Photovoltaic devices ===

The tunable absorption spectrum and high extinction coefficients of quantum dots make them attractive for light harvesting technologies such as photovoltaics. Quantum dots may be able to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of today&#x27;s typical silicon photovoltaic cells. According to an experimental report from 2004, quantum dots of lead selenide (PbSe) can produce more than one exciton from one high-energy photon via the process of carrier multiplication or multiple exciton generation (MEG). This compares favorably to today&#x27;s photovoltaic cells which can only manage one exciton per high-energy photon, with high kinetic energy carriers losing their energy as heat. On the other hand, the quantum-confined ground-states of colloidal quantum dots (such as lead sulfide, PbS) incorporated in wider-bandgap host semiconductors (such as perovskite) can allow the generation of photocurrent from photons with energy below the host bandgap, via a two-photon absorption process, offering another approach (termed intermediate band, IB) to exploit a broader range of the solar spectrum and thereby achieve higher photovoltaic efficiency.

Colloidal quantum dot photovoltaics would theoretically be cheaper to manufacture, as they can be made using simple chemical reactions.

==== Quantum dot only solar cells ====
Aromatic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) (such as 4-nitrobenzoic acid) can be used to improve the band alignment at electrodes for better efficiencies. This technique has provided a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.7%. The SAM is positioned between ZnO–PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) film junction to modify band alignment via the dipole moment of the constituent SAM molecule, and the band tuning may be modified via the density, dipole and the orientation of the SAM molecule.

==== Quantum dot in hybrid solar cells ====
Colloidal quantum dots are also used in inorganic–organic hybrid solar cells. These solar cells are attractive because of the potential for low-cost fabrication and relatively high efficiency. Incorporation of metal oxides, such as ZnO, TiO2, and Nb2O5 nanomaterials into organic photovoltaics have been commercialized using full roll-to-roll processing. A 13.2% power conversion efficiency is claimed in Si nanowire/PEDOT:PSS hybrid solar cells.

==== Quantum dot with nanowire in solar cells ====
Another potential use involves capped single-crystal ZnO nanowires with CdSe quantum dots, immersed in mercaptopropionic acid as hole transport medium in order to obtain a QD-sensitized solar cell. The morphology of the nanowires allowed the electrons to have a direct pathway to the photoanode. This form of solar cell exhibits 50–60% internal quantum efficiencies.

Nanowires with quantum dot coatings on silicon nanowires (SiNW) and carbon quantum dots. The use of SiNWs instead of planar silicon enhances the antiflection properties of Si. The SiNW exhibits a light-trapping effect due to light trapping in the SiNW. This use of SiNWs in conjunction with carbon quantum dots resulted in a solar cell that reached 9.10% PCE.

Graphene quantum dots have also been blended with organic electronic materials to improve efficiency and lower cost in photovoltaic devices and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) compared to graphene sheets. These graphene quantum dots were functionalized with organic ligands that experience photoluminescence from UV–visible absorption.

=== Quantum dot anodes for batteries ===

==== Improvement in batteries ====
It can be seen improvements in the electrical conductivity and charge retention of batteries when QDs are added to anodes.

In a comparison made between Pure MnO and MnO doped with quantum dot for the capacity of charge and discharge in (mAh/g) against the number of cycles, it can be seen that battery capacity, or the amount of energy that a battery can hold, is higher in MnO Quantum Dote-doped batteries than in batteries without, and remains higher after many charging/discharging cycles, taking in consideration a current density of Ag^-1. There exists a constant average difference of around 250 mAh/g in favor of the doped compound for both charge and discharge comparisons, comparing from 0 to 60 cycles, going from 1000 mAh/g to 450 mAh/g in the first 60 cycles for the doped compound, and from 750 mAh/g to 200 mAh/g for the pure MnO.

A comparison using Graphene Quantum Dots for a NP-SiAl compound not only shows higher discharge capacities but also an improved electrochemical impedance spectroscopy plot, indicating that the battery has better electrical conductivity. For the case of the NP-SiAl/GQDs, the value of -Z´´/ohm reaches a peak of 300, for 250 Z´/ohm, while for the pure NP-SiAl, the peak of 300 -Z´´/ohm is reached at 650 Z´/ohm.

==== Energy in QDs ====
In terms of energy, each individual quantum dot presents an energy level which is compared to that of an atom.Extending this property, an artificial lattice (made out of QDs) would have an energy band structure similar to the one of a crystalline semiconductor.

The energy level of a dot is dependent on the amount of charge in it and its capacitance.The energy present in electrons is proportional to the square of the wavelength, which makes the energy levels to rise quickly

==== Common QDs for batteries ====
Carbon quantum dots and Graphite quantum dots are the main types of quantum dots used in batteries.

The graphene quantum dots are made out of graphene sheets which are attached among them, forming a morphology similar to a 2D-disk.

The carbon quantum dots have an isotropic spherical structure and are made out of crystalline and amorphous carbon sheets.

From these common quantum dots, the graphene ones, are usually more crystalline than the carbon ones, this is because they have the crystallinity of a mono-layered and few-layered graphene.

=== Light-emitting diodes ===

Several methods are proposed for using quantum dots to improve existing light-emitting diode (LED) design, including &quot;quantum dot light-emitting diode&quot; (QD-LED or QLED) displays, and &quot;quantum dot white-light-emitting diode&quot; (QD-WLED) displays. Because quantum dots naturally produce monochromatic light, they can be more efficient than light sources which must be color filtered. QD-LEDs can be fabricated on a silicon substrate, which allows them to be integrated onto standard silicon-based integrated circuits or microelectromechanical systems.

=== Quantum dot displays ===

Quantum dots are valued for displays because they emit light in very specific Gaussian distributions. This can result in a display with visibly more accurate colors.

A conventional color liquid crystal display (LCD) is usually backlit by fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) or conventional white LEDs that are color filtered to produce red, green, and blue pixels. Quantum dot displays use blue-emitting LEDs rather than white LEDs as the light sources. The converting part of the emitted light is converted into pure green and red light by the corresponding color quantum dots placed in front of the blue LED or using a quantum dot infused diffuser sheet in the backlight optical stack. Blank pixels are also used to allow the blue LED light to still generate blue hues. This type of white light as the backlight of an LCD panel allows for the best color gamut at lower cost than an RGB LED combination using three LEDs.

Another method by which quantum dot displays can be achieved is the electroluminescent (EL) or electro-emissive method. This involves embedding quantum dots in each individual pixel. These are then activated and controlled via an electric current application. Since this is often light emitting itself, the achievable colors may be limited in this method. Electro-emissive QD-LED TVs exist in laboratories only.

The ability of QDs to precisely convert and tune a spectrum makes them attractive for LCD displays. Previous LCD displays can waste energy converting red-green poor, blue-yellow rich white light into a more balanced lighting. By using QDs, only the necessary colors for ideal images are contained in the screen. The result is a screen that is brighter, clearer, and more energy-efficient. The first commercial application of quantum dots was the Sony XBR X900A series of flat panel televisions released in 2013.

In June 2006, QD Vision announced technical success in making a proof-of-concept quantum dot display and show a bright emission in the visible and near infrared region of the spectrum. A QD-LED integrated at a scanning microscopy tip was used to demonstrate fluorescence near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) imaging.

=== Photodetector devices ===
Quantum dot photodetectors (QDPs) can be fabricated either via solution-processing, or from conventional single-crystalline semiconductors. Conventional single-crystalline semiconductor QDPs are precluded from integration with flexible organic electronics due to the incompatibility of their growth conditions with the process windows required by organic semiconductors. On the other hand, solution-processed QDPs can be readily integrated with an almost infinite variety of substrates, and also postprocessed atop other integrated circuits. Such colloidal QDPs have potential applications in visible- and infrared-light cameras, machine vision, industrial inspection, spectroscopy, and fluorescent biomedical imaging.

=== Photocatalysts ===
Quantum dots also function as photocatalysts for the light driven chemical conversion of water into hydrogen as a pathway to solar fuel. In photocatalysis, electron hole pairs formed in the dot under band gap excitation drive redox reactions in the surrounding liquid. Generally, the photocatalytic activity of the dots is related to the particle size and its degree of quantum confinement. This is because the band gap determines the chemical energy that is stored in the dot in the excited state. An obstacle for the use of quantum dots in photocatalysis is the presence of surfactants on the surface of the dots. These surfactants (or ligands) interfere with the chemical reactivity of the dots by slowing down mass transfer and electron transfer processes. Also, quantum dots made of metal chalcogenides are chemically unstable under oxidizing conditions and undergo photo corrosion reactions.

=== Fundamental Materials Science ===
Quantum dots can also be used to study fundamental effects in materials science. By coupling two or more such quantum dots, an artificial molecule can be made, exhibiting hybridization even at room temperature. Precise assembly of quantum dots can form superlattices that act as artificial solid-state materials that exhibit unique optical and electronic properties.

== Theory ==
Quantum dots are theoretically described as a point-like, or zero dimensional (0D) entity. Most of their properties depend on the dimensions, shape, and materials of which QDs are made. Generally, QDs present different thermodynamic properties from their bulk materials. One of these effects is melting-point depression. Optical properties of spherical metallic QDs are well described by the Mie scattering theory.

== Quantum confinement in semiconductors ==

The energy levels of a single particle in a quantum dot can be predicted using the particle in a box model in which the energies of states depend on the length of the box. For an exciton inside a quantum dot, there is also the Coulomb interaction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole. By comparing the quantum dot&#x27;s size to the exciton Bohr radius, three regimes can be defined. In the &#x27;strong confinement regime&#x27;, the quantum dot&#x27;s radius is much smaller than the exciton Bohr radius, respectively the confinement energy dominates over the Coulomb interaction. In the &#x27;weak confinement&#x27; regime, the quantum dot is larger than the exciton Bohr radius, respectively the confinement energy is smaller than the Coulomb interactions between electron and hole. The regime where the exciton Bohr radius and confinement potential are comparable is called the &#x27;intermediate confinement regime&#x27;.

;Band gap energy: The band gap can become smaller in the strong confinement regime as the energy levels split up. The exciton Bohr radius can be expressed as:
:: formula_1
: where &quot;a&quot;B = 0.053 nm is the Bohr radius, &quot;m&quot; is the mass, &quot;μ&quot; is the reduced mass, and &quot;ε&quot;r is the size-dependent dielectric constant (relative permittivity). This results in the increase in the total emission energy (the sum of the energy levels in the smaller band gaps in the strong confinement regime is larger than the energy levels in the band gaps of the original levels in the weak confinement regime) and the emission at various wavelengths. If the size distribution of QDs is not enough peaked, the convolution of multiple emission wavelengths is observed as a continuous spectra.
;Confinement energy: The exciton entity can be modeled using the particle in the box. The electron and the hole can be seen as hydrogen in the Bohr model with the hydrogen nucleus replaced by the hole of positive charge and negative electron mass. Then the energy levels of the exciton can be represented as the solution to the particle in a box at the ground level (&quot;n&quot; = 1) with the mass replaced by the reduced mass. Thus by varying the size of the quantum dot, the confinement energy of the exciton can be controlled.

;Bound exciton energy: There is Coulomb attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole. The negative energy involved in the attraction is proportional to Rydberg&#x27;s energy and inversely proportional to square of the size-dependent dielectric constant of the semiconductor. When the size of the semiconductor crystal is smaller than the exciton Bohr radius, the Coulomb interaction must be modified to fit the situation.

Therefore, the sum of these energies can be represented by Brus equation:
: formula_2
where &quot;μ&quot; is the reduced mass, &quot;a&quot; is the radius of the quantum dot, &quot;m&quot;e is the free electron mass, &quot;m&quot;h is the hole mass, and &quot;ε&quot;r is the size-dependent dielectric constant.

Although the above equations were derived using simplifying assumptions, they imply that the electronic transitions of the quantum dots will depend on their size. These quantum confinement effects are apparent only below the critical size. Larger particles do not exhibit this effect. This effect of quantum confinement on the quantum dots has been repeatedly verified experimentally and is a key feature of many emerging electronic structures.

The Coulomb interaction between confined carriers can also be studied by numerical means when results unconstrained by asymptotic approximations are pursued.

Besides confinement in all three dimensions (that is, a quantum dot), other quantum confined semiconductors include:
* Quantum wires, which confine electrons or holes in two spatial dimensions and allow free propagation in the third.
* Quantum wells, which confine electrons or holes in one dimension and allow free propagation in two dimensions.

=== Models ===
A variety of theoretical frameworks exist to model optical, electronic, and structural properties of quantum dots. These may be broadly divided into quantum mechanical, semiclassical, and classical.

=== Quantum mechanics ===
Quantum mechanical models and simulations of quantum dots often involve the interaction of electrons with a pseudopotential or random matrix.

==== Semiclassical ====
Semiclassical models of quantum dots frequently incorporate a chemical potential. For example, the thermodynamic chemical potential of an &quot;N&quot;-particle system is given by
: formula_3
whose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schrödinger equation. The definition of capacitance,
: formula_4
with the potential difference
: formula_5
may be applied to a quantum dot with the addition or removal of individual electrons,
: formula_6
Then
: formula_7
is the &quot;quantum capacitance&quot; of a quantum dot, where we denoted by the ionization potential and by the electron affinity of the &quot;N&quot;-particle system.

==== Classical mechanics ====
Classical models of electrostatic properties of electrons in quantum dots are similar in nature to the Thomson problem of optimally distributing electrons on a unit sphere.

The classical electrostatic treatment of electrons confined to spherical quantum dots is similar to their treatment in the Thomson, or plum pudding model, of the atom.

The classical treatment of both two-dimensional and three-dimensional quantum dots exhibit electron shell-filling behavior. A &quot;periodic table of classical artificial atoms&quot; has been described for two-dimensional quantum dots. As well, several connections have been reported between the three-dimensional Thomson problem and electron shell-filling patterns found in naturally occurring atoms found throughout the periodic table. This latter work originated in classical electrostatic modeling of electrons in a spherical quantum dot represented by an ideal dielectric sphere.

== History ==
For thousands of years, glassmakers were able to make colored glass by adding different dusts and powdered elements such as silver, gold and cadmium and then used different temperatures to produce shades of glass. In the 19th century, scientists started to understand how glass color depended on elements and heating-cooling techniques. It was also found that for the same element and preparation, the color depended on the dust particles&#x27; size.

Herbert Fröhlich in the 1930s first explored the idea that material properties can depend on the macroscopic dimensions of a small particle due to quantum size effects.

The first quantum dots were synthesized in a glass matrix by Alexei A. Onushchenko and Alexey Ekimov in 1981 at the Vavilov State Optical Institute and independently in colloidal suspension by Louis E. Brus team at Bell Labs in 1983. They were first theorized by Alexander Efros in 1982. It was quickly identified that the optical changes that appeared for very small particles were due to quantum mechanical effects.

The term &quot;quantum dot&quot; first appeared in a paper first authored by Mark Reed in 1986. According to Brus, the term &quot;quantum dot&quot; was coined by while they were working at Bell Labs.

In 1993, David J. Norris, Christopher B. Murray and Moungi Bawendi at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported on a hot-injection synthesis method for producing reproducible quantum dots with well-defined size and with high optical quality. The method opened the door to the development of large-scale technological applications of quantum dots in a wide range of areas.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2023 was awarded to Moungi Bawendi, Louis E. Brus and Alexey Ekimov &quot;for the discovery and synthesis of quantum dots.&quot;

<text>A lockout is a work stoppage or denial of employment initiated by the management of a company during a labor dispute. In contrast to a strike, in which employees refuse to work, a lockout is initiated by employers or industry owners. 

Lockouts are usually implemented by simply refusing to admit employees onto company premises, and may include changing locks or hiring security guards for the premises. Other implementations include a fine for showing up, or a simple refusal of clocking in on the time clock. For these reasons, lockouts are referred to as the antithesis of strikes.

Lockouts are common in major league sports. In the United States and Canada, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League have all experienced lockouts.

== Causes ==
A lockout is generally an attempt to enforce specific terms of employment upon a group of employees during a dispute. It is often used to force unionized workers to accept new conditions, such as lower wages. If the union is asking for higher wages, better benefits, or maintaining benefits, a manager may use the threat of a lockout – or an actual lockout – to convince the union to relent.

== Examples ==
Far from all labour disputes involve lockouts (or strikes), but lockouts have been used on a large scale around the world during and after industrialization. Some of the lockout incidents are historically significant.

=== Ireland ===
The Dublin Lockout was a major industrial dispute between 20,000 workers and 300 employers in Dublin. The dispute lasted from 26 August 1913 to 18 January 1914, and is often viewed as the most severe and significant industrial dispute in the history of Ireland. Central to the dispute was the right to unionize.

=== United States ===
In the United States, under federal labor law, an employer may hire only temporary replacements during a lockout. In a strike, unless it is an unfair labor practice strike, an employer may legally hire permanent replacements. Also, in many US states, employees who are locked out are eligible to receive unemployment benefits, but they are not eligible for such benefits during a strike.

For the above reasons, many American employers have historically been reluctant to impose lockouts and instead try to provoke a strike. However, as American unions have increasingly begun to resort to slowdowns rather than strikes, lockouts have become a more common tactic of many employers. Even as strikes are on the decline, lockouts are on the rise in the US.

In 1892, after several wage cuts and disputes with the employers at the Homestead Steel Mill in Homestead, Pennsylvania, the union called for a strike after the company stopped discussing its decisions with the union. Henry Clay Frick shut down the plant and locked out all workers, preventing them from entering the mill.

Lockouts have also occurred in professional sports, usually due to disputes between team owners and players concerning their respective league&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement. Major League Baseball saw four lockouts in modern history, including during the 1990 and 2021–22 offseasons. The National Basketball Association had four in the 1995 offseason, the 1996 offseason, and the 1998–99 and 2011–12 seasons. The National Hockey League endured lockouts in 1994–95, 2004–05 and 2012–13, with the 2004–05 lockout ultimately resulting in the entire season being canceled. Besides a player lockout in 2011, the National Football League had two involving referees in 2001 and 2012.

In September 2016, Long Island University became the first institution of higher education to use a lockout against its faculty members.

=== Australia ===
On 8 April, 1998, stevedoring company Patrick Corporation sought to restructure its operations for productivity reasons. In an industrial watershed event, it sacked all its workers and imposed a lockout on wharves around Australia.

On 29 October 2011, Qantas declared a lockout of all domestic employees in the face of ongoing union industrial action. That cancelled all flights, grounding the entire fleet for several days.

=== Canada ===
On August 15, 2005, 5,500 employees of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, a Canadian public broadcaster were locked out by CEO Robert Rabinovitch in a dispute over future hiring practices. While services continued during the lock-out, programming consisted mainly of repeats, with news coverage being provided by the BBC on TV and wire-service feeds on radio. The lock-out ended on October 11, 2005.

=== Denmark ===
On 2 April 2013, the Danish Union of Teachers () and the National Union of Municipalities () declared a lockout for more than 60,000 primary school teachers across the country. Over 600,000 students were also affected by the lockout and could not go to school.

The dispute was about whether teachers should have extra working time, as the Local Government Association (KL) wanted. The Danish Union of Teachers (DFL) was against it and could not find a solution. After 24 days of being locked out, the teachers lost the labour dispute on 25 April 2013, with a government intervention to end the lockout. The government chose to apply all of KL&#x27;s main demands, and the teachers received a small wage increase as compensation.

== Lock-in ==
The term &quot;lock-in&quot; refers to the practice of physically preventing workers from leaving a workplace. In most jurisdictions, it is illegal, but it is occasionally reported, especially in some developing countries.

Lock-ins should not be confused with a sitdown strike, like the Flint sit-down strike between the United Automobile Workers and General Motors Corporation.

More recently, lock-ins have been carried out by employees against management, which have been labeled &#x27;bossnapping&#x27; by the mainstream media. In France during March 2009, 3M&#x27;s national manager was locked in his office for 24 hours by employees in a dispute over redundancies. The following month, union employees of a call center managed by Synovate in Auckland locked the front doors of the office, in response to management locking them out. Such practices bear some resemblance to the &quot;gherao&quot; in India. It is also caused by disagreement between employer and employees in a certain department.

<text>Robert Lepage (born December 12, 1957) is a Canadian playwright, actor, film director, and stage director.

== Early life ==
Lepage was raised in Quebec City. At age five, he was diagnosed with a rare form of alopecia, which caused complete hair loss over his whole body. He also struggled with clinical depression in his teens as he came to terms with being gay.

Between 1975 and 1978, he studied theatre at Quebec City&#x27;s Conservatoire d&#x27;Art Dramatique. He subsequently participated in workshops at Alain Knapp&#x27;s theatre school in Paris, France.

==Theatrical career==
After coming back to Quebec City, Lepage wrote, directed and played in a few independent productions and joined Théâtre Repère in 1980. With that company, he created &quot;Circulations&quot; (1984), which was presented across Canada and won an award as best Canadian production during La Quinzaine Internationale de Théâtre de Québec. The following year, he created &quot;The Dragons&#x27; Trilogy&quot; and immediately received international recognition. &quot;Vinci&quot; (1986), &quot;Polygraphe&quot; (1987–1990) and &quot;Tectonic Plates&quot; (1988–1990) followed and were also toured around the world.

Lepage was the artistic director of the National Arts Centre&#x27;s Théâtre français in Ottawa from 1989 to 1993, and continued to stage plays. His productions of &quot;Needles and Opium&quot;, &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; were all created in that period.

Donald Winkler&#x27;s 1992 documentary film &quot;Breaking a Leg: Robert Lepage and the Echo Project&quot; profiled the creative process behind Lepage&#x27;s work on &quot;Echo&quot;, a 1989 production which was Lepage&#x27;s first significant popular and critical failure as a director.
In 1994, Lepage founded Ex Machina, a multidisciplinary production company, for which he is artistic director. Lepage and Ex Machina have toured a number of productions internationally to critical and popular acclaim, including &quot;The Seven Streams of the River Ota&quot; (1994) and &quot;Elsinore&quot; (1995). Lepage was invited in 1994 to direct August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;A Dream Play&quot; at Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm, Sweden. It premiered in the fall of 1994 and guest played in the spring of 1995 in Glasgow Scotland. &quot;Geometry of Miracles&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Far Side of the Moon&quot; (, 2000), a solo show in which he juxtaposed the Cold War competition of the Americans and the Soviets in the Space Race with the story of two Québécois brothers—one straight, one gay—and their competitive relationship after their mother&#x27;s death. It won four trophies at le Gala des Masques, a Time Out Award and the Evening Standard Award. In 2003 &quot;The Far Side of the Moon&quot; was adapted by Lepage—who plays both brothers—into a film of the same name.

Lepage has directed five other feature films: &quot;The Confessional (Le Confessionnal)&quot; (1995), &quot;Polygraph (Le Polygraphe)&quot; (1996), &quot;Nô&quot; (1998), &quot;Possible Worlds&quot; (2000) and &quot;Triptych (Triptyque)&quot; (2013) (the latter co-directed by Pedro Pires), and has acted in films by other directors, including &quot;Jesus of Montreal (Jésus de Montréal)&quot; (1989) and &quot;Stardom&quot; (2001) by Denys Arcand. He has also been involved in music productions, being the stage director for the Secret World Tour by Peter Gabriel in 1993/1994, and the subsequent Growing Up tour in 2003/2004. He directed a number of operas, including &quot;Bluebeard&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;Erwartung&quot; at the Canadian Opera Company, &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; in Japan and Paris, and Lorin Maazel&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; at the Royal Opera House in London in 2005. Finally, Cirque du Soleil asked him to create the permanent Las Vegas show named &quot;Kà&quot; at the MGM Grand in 2005.

&quot;The Andersen Project&quot; is his last solo play, based on the life and works of Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, and his tale &quot;The Dryad&quot;; it was presented by Lepage himself in ten countries, and later starred Yves Jacques.

&quot;Lipsynch&quot;, his large-canvas work, premiered in its first version in Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s Northern Stage in February 2007 in its five-hour version; it has since been lengthened to nine hours. Three scenes of &quot;Lipsynch&quot; were later adapted to create the installation &quot;FRAGMENTATION&quot; (2011) by Richard Castelli and Volker Kuchelmeister for the stereoscopic system ReACTOR, designed by Sarah Kenderdine and Jeffrey Shaw. Walking around the hexagonal base of the device, the viewer can see the same scenes filmed from different angles.

He also staged Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, which was presented in Brussels&#x27; Opéra de la Monnaie in April 2007 and San Francisco War Memorial Opera House in November 2007.

In 2008, Lepage and Ex Machina created &quot;The Image Mill&quot;, celebrating the 400th anniversary of Quebec City. For forty nights, a forty-minute show was displayed by the banks of Bassin Louise, using the huge surface of the Bunge grain elevators as a giant screen. It was at the time the biggest outdoor architectural projection in the world.

In November 2008, Lepage directed a staged version of Hector Berlioz&#x27; &quot;The Damnation of Faust&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. In February, 2009, Lepage premiered a new work entitled &quot;Eonnagata&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London, UK. For this project he collaborated with the dancers Sylvie Guillem and Russell Maliphant, fashion designer Alexander McQueen, lighting designer Michael Hulls and sound designer Jean-Sébastien Côté.

His production of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, conducted by Christopher Hogwood, was re-released at the Teatro Real, Madrid, in January 2009.

In spring 2009, Lepage presented &quot;The Blue Dragon&quot; (&quot;Le Dragon Bleu&quot;), a sequel to his &quot;Dragons&#x27; Trilogy&quot;, in which he reprised (more than twenty years later) the role of Pierre Lamontagne, a Québécois artist who lives in China.

In fall 2009, Lepage directed &quot;The Nightingale and Other Short Fables&quot;, an operatic staging of short works by Stravinsky blending hand shadow puppetry, Kabuki theatre, Chinese opera and Vietnamese Water puppetry. The Canadian Opera Company in Toronto premiered the work.

Lepage then wrote and directed &quot;Totem&quot;, Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s next touring show, and began work on a new production of &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; by Richard Wagner for the Metropolitan Opera of New York. The series was presented in installments during the 2010/2011 and 2011/2012 seasons – &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; were premiered during the 2010/2011 season, &quot;Siegfried&quot; premiered on October 27, 2011, and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; premiered on January 27, 2012. Lepage&#x27;s complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle premiered in April 2012. The Metropolitan Opera had to install steel reinforcements under the stage in order to support LePage&#x27;s roughly 45 tonne set. Lepage was featured in a 2012 documentary about the Met &quot;Ring&quot; production, &quot;Wagner&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

In 2012, Lepage appeared as a hologram in Martin Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Mars et Avril&quot;, a science fiction film based on the graphic novels of the same name.

Lepage&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;memory play&quot; &quot;887&quot; played in New York City (as &quot;New York Critics Pick&quot;) and Toronto in 2017 and 2019. In an associated interview, he calls himself a &quot;lukewarm separatist&quot;.

In 2018, Lepage launched &quot;SLĀV&quot; at the Montreal Jazz Festival; Betty Bonifassi&#x27;s creation was so controversial that it was cancelled due to public protest - with the charge that white people singing the songs of black 19th-century slaves constituted cultural appropriation. The show caused public protest on the basis of this accusation. Lepage&#x27;s next production, &quot;Kanata&quot;, planned for Paris in December 2018, presenting Europeans&#x27; first settlement of Canada, was cancelled in July, 2018, after complaints from members of the Indigenous community led to his financial backers&#x27; withdrawal. Although the show was initially canceled, it was finally presented in December 2018 and received support from Indigenous communities.

Lepage&#x27;s production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; was presented in Quebec in July and August 2018 and there are plans to bring it to the Metropolitan Opera.

At the International Shakespeare Festival 2022 in Craiova, praising him for his innovative spirit and unique creativity, theatre scholar Octavian Saiu described Lepage as one of the true masters of contemporary theatre.

In 2022, Robert Lepage came back to the big screen in Martin Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;The 12 Tasks of Imelda&quot;, co-starring Ginette Reno and Michel Barrette, in which he plays Martin and Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s father Jean, a notary.

The same year, Lepage announced the creation of a new play based on the work of painter Jean-Paul Riopelle. The show is set to be presented in 2023 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the artist.

<text>The Angel, Islington, is a historic landmark and a series of buildings that have stood on the corner of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road in Islington, London, England. The land originally belonged to the Clerkenwell Priory and has had various properties built on it since the 16th century. An inn on the site was called the &quot;Angel Inn&quot; by 1614, and the crossing became generally known as &quot;the Angel&quot;. The site was bisected by the New Road, which opened in 1756, and properties on the site have been rebuilt several times up to the 20th century. The corner site gave its name to Angel tube station, opened in 1901, and the surrounding Angel area of London.

The current structure was completed in 1903 and was known as the Angel Hotel. The building was acquired by J. Lyons and Co. in 1921 and was used as a restaurant. In 1935 it was chosen as a property for the British version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The building was sold to the London County Council in 1959 to be demolished as part of plans for road improvement works that did not take place. It was returned to private ownership, renovated from 1979 and reopened in 1982 as the Angel Corner House. It contained a branch of the Co-operative Bank until 2024. It is currently used as offices, and is a grade II listed building.

==History==

===Early history===
In the early 16th century, a building in this area of London on the Great North Road was known as the Sheepcote. It was named after lands belonging to St John&#x27;s Priory. The building was being used as an inn by the end of the 16th century and was known as the Angel by 1614. The inn took its name from the Angel of the Annunciation which appeared on the sign.

The Angel Inn became a useful stop when travelling from the City of London, as the rural area outside it was considered dangerous, with travellers having armed escorts from Wood&#x27;s Close to Islington. Despite its name, and common association with Islington, the grounds of the inn and all of the western edge of Islington High Street were in neighbouring Clerkenwell.

===17th–18th century===

By 1630, the inn was owned by William Riplingham, officer of the Great Wardrobe. Riplingham built an extension of the courtyard ranges on the site of the Angel Inn around 1638, for which he was fined due to breaking building regulations. These ranges survived up to the early 19th century. By 1677, the Angel was owned by James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton, and occupied by Edward Fawcett, who ran the inn until his death in 1696. The premises accommodated livestock traders (drovers) destined for Smithfield Market, as well as long-distance travellers.

In the early 18th century, the Angel was the largest coaching house in a row of several along Islington High Street. Robert Bartholomew took over ownership of the inn in 1744 and was succeeded by his son, Christopher, around 1766, who continued to run it until the end of the century. The inn was the subject of William Hogarth&#x27;s 1747 drawing, &quot;The Stage-Coach, Or The Country Inn Yard&quot;, which depicted busy coaching inn trade and traffic. In his book &quot;The Inns and Taverns of Old London&quot; published in 1909, Henry C. Shelley said &quot;The Angel dates back to before 1665... In the seventeenth century and later, as old pictures testify, the inn presented the usual features of a large old country hostelry.&quot;

The building of the New Road in 1756 bisected the Angel Inn site and the stable buildings were cut off on the southern side. The inn was on the northern side, on the corner of what is now the junction of Islington High Street and Pentonville Road, while the stables were now on what is St John Street, adjacent to the New Inn, which had been established in 1744. The Angel benefited from the extra traffic brought by the New Road, and in addition to accommodation provided a number of assembly rooms for public meetings. The author and political activist Thomas Paine is believed to have begun writing &quot;Rights of Man&quot; at the Angel in 1790, and there is a monument on Islington High Street commemorating this.

===19th century===
By the start of the 19th century, fields south of the Angel were being built on, resulting in all land towards the City of London becoming urban. The Angel was rebuilt during 1819 and 1820 to become a post house and meeting place for various London businesses. The redevelopment was directed by Charles Smith, and subsequently let to James Smith. The size of the inn was reduced and adjacent plots were sold off, allowing development of houses and shops, though the inn&#x27;s grounds remained substantial. It was now advertised as the &quot;Angel Inn Tavern and Hotel for Gentlemen and Families&quot;, and the front of the tavern faced the New Road.

By the 1850s, the Angel was reported to be in decline. The New Road was renamed Pentonville Road in 1857, and the inn&#x27;s management successfully put shop fronts on the road around 1870, along with extensive refurbishments. In 1880, the Angel was refurbished internally for William Henry and Richard Baker, later to become large-scale pub owners. In 1883 the stables were sold to the London Street Tramways and the main building was sold to the brewers Truman, Hanbury, Buxton &amp; Co. in 1896.

Construction of a new building in pale terracotta stone with a corner cupola was started in 1899 by the architects Frederick James Eedle and Sydney Herbert Meyers. The brewers proclaimed the new building to be &quot;the widest-known hostelry in the world&quot;, and work was completed in 1903. A panel on a second floor balcony still bears this opening date. The parish of Clerkenwell became the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury in 1900 and when the City and South London Railway opened a new tube station in the area in 1901 it was named Angel.

===20th–21st century===

The pub ceased trading in 1921 and the building was sold to restaurateurs J. Lyons and Co. It was adapted as the flagship site of the business, though it was not technically a standard Lyons Corner House. The restaurant remained popular, and could accommodate up to 300 people, as did Lyons Corner Houses across London throughout the 1920s and 30s, but fell out of favour as fast food began to become popular in the 1950s.

In 1959 The Angel was closed and sold to the London County Council as part of a plan to demolish it to make way for a new road scheme at the Angel intersection. It was used temporarily by the City University. Finsbury merged with the Metropolitan Borough of Islington to form the London Borough of Islington in 1965 and ownership of the site passed to the Greater London Council. The proposals for demolition of the site along with road changes were opposed by Homes before Roads and the Islington Society. Plans to alter the intersection and create a layout similar to that at Old Street roundabout were abandoned and the building was saved from demolition.

The Greater London Council sold the building to the New River Company, with the property becoming part of the London Merchant Securities portfolio. The building was renovated between 1979 and 1982 by McLaughlin &amp; Harvey Ltd with architects Elsom Pack &amp; Roberts converting the building for office use and renaming it Angel Corner House. The ground floor was used as a branch of The Co-operative Bank until 2024, and the ORC International market research agency occupies the upper floors. The building is now privately owned by Hamilton Investment Properties.

Angel Corner House, along with this section of Islington High Street, has been part of the Angel conservation area since 1981 and Angel Corner House has been a listed building since 1991 and is Grade II on the National Heritage List for England. The council describe this as &quot;the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance&quot;. Local planning regulations stipulate that new development in the area must not be taller than the dome on Angel Corner House.

==Related developments==
On 27 October 1998, a J D Wetherspoon pub named The Angel opened at 3 Islington High Street, adjacent to Angel Corner House. The site is part of the original Angel Inn site that was redeveloped as shops in the 1820. The pub was later sold and renamed The Junction, to be run independently. In 2024 that pub was sold again and renamed The Peacock, reviving the name of a coaching inn which stood nearby from 1564 to 1962.

Ten Four Pentonville Road is a redevelopment of Angel Mews. It is located at the site of the original Angel Inn&#x27;s stables. The Hilton London Angel Islington Hotel is named after the pub. It is located on Upper Street to the north of the original Angel.

==Cultural references==
&quot;The Angel Islington&quot; is a property in the British version of &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In the game it is the third-cheapest property on the board, reflecting the downmarket state of Islington through most of the 20th century until its gentrification in the 1980s. Victor Watson, of British manufacturers John Waddington Ltd, and his secretary, Marjory Philips, decided to include the property on the board whilst taking tea at the cafe. This account of events appears on a plaque displayed in the bank within the building; the inscription says it is the &quot;only site on the board named after a building&quot;. It is part of the light blue group with Pentonville Road and Euston Road. In the game, a house at the Angel costs £50; by the turn of the 21st century a house on Islington High Street fetched around £600,000.

In 1827, James Pollard painted &quot;The Royal Mail Coaches for the North Leaving the Angel, Islington&quot;, currently on display in the Tate Gallery. The Charles Dickens novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; contains a reference to the Angel, where &quot;London began in earnest&quot;. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s fantasy television series &quot;Neverwhere&quot; has a character named Angel Islington, after the inn. &quot;The Angel, Islington&quot; is the opening track on singer/songwriter Frank Turner&#x27;s album &quot;Positive Songs for Negative People&quot;.

<text>Cooperation (written as co-operation in British English and, with a varied usage along time, coöperation) takes place when a group of organisms works or acts together for a collective benefit to the group as opposed to working in competition for selfish individual benefit. In biology, many animal and plant species cooperate both with other members of their own species and with members of other species with whom they have (symbiotic or mutualistic) relationships.

== Among humans ==
Humans cooperate for the same reasons as other animals: immediate benefit, genetic relatedness, and reciprocity, but also for particularly human reasons, such as honesty signaling (indirect reciprocity), cultural group selection, and for reasons having to do with cultural evolution.

Language allows humans to cooperate on a very large scale. Certain studies have suggested that fairness affects human cooperation; individuals are willing to punish at their own cost (&quot;altruistic punishment&quot;) if they believe that they are being treated unfairly. Sanfey, et al. conducted an experiment where 19 individuals were scanned using MRI while playing an ultimatum game in the role of the responder. They received offers from other human partners and from a computer partner. Responders refused unfair offers from human partners at a significantly higher rate than those from a computer partner. The experiment also suggested that altruistic punishment is associated with negative emotions that are generated in unfair situations by the anterior insula of the brain.

It has been observed that image scoring, where a participant learns of their counterpart&#x27;s prior behavior or reputation, promotes cooperative behavior in situations where direct reciprocity is unlikely. This implies that in situations where reputation and status are involved, humans tend to cooperate more.

Many organisms other than apes, such as fish, birds, and insects exhibit cooperative behavior: teaching, helping, and self-sacrifice, and can coordinate to solve problems. The author Nichola Raihani argues that Earth is a history of teamwork, collective action, and cooperation. Its a selfish behavior, working together towards solving a problem, because it yields success to engage cooperatively, typically this means work in effort towards solving a problem can often only ever be solved by a cooperative effort, for example for most individuals working cooperatively but especially within families has made cooperation behaviors be generally aggregated together to accomplish major problem solving for survival, like migration and success, particularly familial success. Democracy for instance was created because of three key traits; social comparison, engagement with collaboration, and wanting to be someone who shares, which all stems from the desire to not monopolize all resources but to gradually accept the divvying up of resources of collaboration (cliques, teams or greater communities). 

When clients are watching and see the current interaction reacting badly, then sometimes everyone else who is waiting will stop watching or go elsewhere, thus they may provide a better service when a client can be made aware of their ability to exhibit cooperative behavior. This has been observed in generosity &#x27;tournaments&#x27; or one-upmanship behavior among people, and among cleaner fish, and its an example of costly behavior that engages in that is about a future underlying benefit that one can gain by gaining those clients, for human beings its particularly the case that unconditional generosity is a particular response which suggests perception of a sexual role advantage as underlining such behavioral choices amongst men when undergoing competitively this way in the presence of attractive females or online.

Every human achievements are actually reliant on the cooperation efforts that have been created by others, from the cursory to the truly magnificent, whether its a mundane achievement or the greatest achievements, it relies on cooperation. We&#x27;re biologically geared to ensuring survival by social instincts like much of the food early human beings ate were hunted or gathered, these are aspects of cooperation that alone cannot be done. To avoid the problem of starvation we had to band together like our distant ancestors if we wish to continue existing. However primates largely lived on large salad bowls so they avoided such pressure, narrowing what they need as a evolutionary strategy. We had to not only cooperate to eat, we also readily need to learn other important life skills to be able continue this strategy and had to raise our children that couldn&#x27;t survive without essential food. 

Kin selection or related inclusive fitness theory is defined as a reproductive strategy that favors the success of an organism&#x27;s relatives, even when it is not in an organism&#x27;s own best interest, it&#x27;s highly relevant to human social behavior, relationships and cooperation.

In the individual psychology of Alfred Adler, a definition of social instinct is; an innate drive for cooperation is what invariably leads individuals to inculcate social interest and the common good to help them achieve self-realization.

== Among other animals ==
Cooperation is common in non-human animals. Besides cooperation with an immediate benefit for both actors, this behavior appears to occur mostly between relatives. Spending time and resources assisting a related individual may reduce an organism&#x27;s chances of survival, but because relatives share genes, may increase the likelihood that the helper&#x27;s genetic traits will be passed on to future generations. The cooperative pulling paradigm is an experimental design used to assess if and under which conditions animals cooperate. It involves two or more animals pulling rewards towards themselves via an apparatus they can not successfully operate alone.

Some researchers assert that cooperation is more complex than this. They maintain that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. Furthermore, they insist that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but may be part of the broader goal of unifying populations.

== Kin selection ==
One specific form of cooperation in animals is kin selection, which can be defined as animals helping to rear a relative&#x27;s offspring in order to enhance their own fitness.

Different theories explaining kin selection have been proposed, including the &quot;pay-to-stay&quot; and &quot;territory inheritance&quot; hypotheses. The &quot;pay-to-stay&quot; theory suggests that individuals help others rear offspring in order to return the favor of the breeders allowing them to live on their land. The &quot;territory inheritance&quot; theory contends that individuals help in order to have improved access to breeding areas once the breeders depart. These two hypotheses both appear to be valid, at least in cichlid fish.

Studies conducted on red wolves support previous researchers&#x27; contention that helpers obtain both immediate and long-term gains from cooperative breeding. Researchers evaluated the consequences of red wolves&#x27; decisions to stay with their packs for extended periods of time after birth. It was found that this &quot;delayed dispersal,&quot; while it involved helping other wolves rear their offspring, extended male wolves&#x27; life spans. These findings suggest that kin selection may not only benefit an individual in the long-term in terms of increased fitness but in the short-term as well through enhanced chance of survival.

Some research even suggests that certain species provide more help to the individuals with which they are more closely related. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination. In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species, including the Western bluebird, Pied kingfisher, Australian magpie, and Dwarf Mongoose. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring among those who have the most to gain from cooperative interactions.

== Cooperative systems ==
Cooperation is a process by which the components of a system work together to achieve the global properties. In other words, individual components that appear to be &quot;selfish&quot; and independent work together to create a highly complex, greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. The phenomenon is generally known as &#x27;emergence&#x27; and is considered an outcome of self-organization. Examples:
* The components in a cell work together to keep it living.
* Neurons create thought and consciousness, other cells work together and communicate to produce multicellular organisms.
* Organisms form food chains and ecosystems.
* People form families, tribes, cities and nations.
* Atoms cooperate in a simple way, by combining to make up molecules.
Understanding the mechanisms that create cooperating agents in a system is one of the most important and least well understood phenomena in nature, though there has not been a lack of effort.

Individual action on behalf of a larger system may be coerced (forced), voluntary (freely chosen), or even unintentional, and consequently individuals and groups might act in concert even though they have almost nothing in common as regards interests or goals. Examples of that can be found in market trade, military wars, families, workplaces, schools and prisons, and more generally any institution or organization of which individuals are part (out of own choice, by law, or forced).

A cooperative system has been defined in organization studies as a complex of physical, biological, personal and social components which are in a specific systematic relationship by reason of the cooperation of two or more persons for at least one definite end.

==The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma==

The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma is a model that demonstrates how, in certain conditions, members of a group will not cooperate even though cooperation would mutually benefit them all. It makes clear that collective self-interest is insufficient to achieving cooperative behavior, at least when an uncooperative individual who &quot;cheats&quot; can exploit cooperating group members. The prisoner&#x27;s dilemma formalizing this problem using game theory and has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental research. The first extensive experimental studies were conducted in the early 1960s by Anatol Rapoport and Albert Chammah. Results from experimental economics show that humans often act more cooperatively than strict self-interest, modeled as the Nash Equilibrium, would seem to dictate. While economic experiments require subjects to make relatively abstract decisions for small stakes, evidence from natural experiments for high stakes support the claim that humans act more cooperatively than strict self-interest would dictate.

One reason may be that if the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma situation is repeated (the iterated prisoner&#x27;s dilemma), it allows non-cooperation to be punished more, and cooperation to be rewarded more, than the single-shot version of the problem would suggest. It has been suggested that this is one reason for the evolution of complex emotions in higher life forms. Playing the iterated version of the game leads to a cascade of brain signals that relate the speed with which players reciprocate cooperation at subsequent rounds.

In evolutionary biology, five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation have been suggested: (i) kin selection, (ii) direct reciprocity, (iii) indirect reciprocity, (iv) spatial structure, and (v) group selection.

<doc id="511567" wikidata="Q184212" url="?curid=511567" title="Théodore Géricault">
<text>Jean-Louis André Théodore Géricault (; 26 September 1791 – 26 January 1824) was a French painter and lithographer, whose best-known painting is &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;. Despite his short life, he was one of the pioneers of the Romantic movement.

==Early life==

Born in Rouen, France, Géricault moved to Paris with his family probably in 1797, where Théodore&#x27;s father, a lawyer, worked in the family tobacco business based at the Hôtel de Longueville on the Place du Carrousel. Géricault&#x27;s artistic abilities were likely first recognized by the painter and art dealer Jean-Louis Laneuville. Laneuville lived at the Hotel de Longueville alongside Jean-Baptiste Caruel, Théodore Géricault&#x27;s maternal uncle, and other members of the extended Géricault family. 

==Saint Domingue &amp; the &quot;Musée français&quot;==
In 1797, Théodore Géricault&#x27;s Saint Domingue relation Louis Robillard de Peronville arrived in Paris with his family, having fled war and revolution in France&#x27;s Caribbean colony. In 1802, with France once more at peace, Robillard de Peronville and Pierre Laurent, an engraver, founded the &quot;Entreprise De La Gravure De La Galerie du Musée Central des Arts à Paris&quot; - a private business partnership producing high-quality engravings of paintings, sculptures, and bas-reliefs in the national museum at the Louvre for a domestic and international clientele. Géricault&#x27;s family circle embraced the &quot;Musée Français&quot;, as the enterprise was known, thus providing Géricault with a rare education in the production and history of art during this critical period in his young life.

In 1808, Géricault began training at the studio of Carle Vernet, where he was educated in the tradition of English sporting art. In 1810, Géricault began studying classical figure composition under Pierre-Narcisse Guérin, a rigorous classicist who disapproved of his student&#x27;s impulsive temperament while recognizing his talent. Géricault soon left the classroom, choosing to study at the Louvre, where from 1810 to 1815 he copied paintings by Rubens, Titian, Velázquez and Rembrandt.

During this period at the Louvre he discovered a vitality he found lacking in the prevailing school of Neoclassicism. Much of his time was spent in Versailles, where he found the stables of the palace open to him, and where he gained his knowledge of the anatomy and action of horses.

==Success==
Géricault&#x27;s first major work, &quot;The Charging Chasseur&quot;, exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1812, revealed the influence of the style of Rubens and an interest in the depiction of contemporary subject matter. This youthful success, ambitious and monumental, was followed by a change in direction: for the next several years Géricault produced a series of small studies of horses and cavalrymen.

He exhibited &quot;Wounded Cuirassier&quot; at the Salon of 1814, a work more labored and less well received. Géricault in a fit of disappointment entered the army and served for a time in the garrison of Versailles. In the nearly two years that followed the 1814 Salon, he also underwent a self-imposed study of figure construction and composition, all the while evidencing a personal predilection for drama and expressive force. The studies and finished drawings from this time attest to Géricault&#x27;s immersion in military and Napoléonic subjects in his early career, fascination with the anatomy and movement of horses, and attraction to Oriental subjects, particularly scenes of mounted warriors. 

A trip to Florence, Rome, and Naples (1816–17), prompted in part by the desire to flee from a romantic entanglement with his aunt, ignited a fascination with Michelangelo. Rome itself inspired the preparation of a monumental canvas, the &quot;Race of the Barberi Horses&quot;, a work of epic composition and abstracted theme that promised to be &quot;entirely without parallel in its time&quot;. However, Géricault never completed the painting and returned to France.

==&quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;==


Géricault continually returned to the military themes of his early paintings, and the series of lithographs he undertook on military subjects after his return from Italy are considered some of the earliest masterworks in that medium. Perhaps his most significant, and certainly most ambitious work, is &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; (1818–19), which depicted the aftermath of a contemporary French shipwreck, &quot;Méduse&quot;, in which the captain had left the crew and passengers to die.

The incident became a national scandal, and Géricault&#x27;s dramatic interpretation presented a contemporary tragedy on a monumental scale. The painting&#x27;s notoriety stemmed from its indictment of a corrupt establishment, but it also dramatized a more eternal theme, that of man&#x27;s struggle with nature. It surely excited the imagination of the young Eugène Delacroix, who posed for one of the dying figures.

The classical depiction of the figures and structure of the composition stand in contrast to the turbulence of the subject, so that the painting constitutes an important bridge between neo-classicism and romanticism. It fuses many influences: the &quot;Last Judgment&quot; of Michelangelo, the monumental approach to contemporary events by Antoine-Jean Gros, figure groupings by Henry Fuseli, and possibly the painting &quot;Watson and the Shark &quot;by John Singleton Copley.

The painting ignited political controversy when first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1819; it then traveled to England in 1820, accompanied by Géricault himself, where it received much praise.

While in London, Géricault witnessed urban poverty, made drawings of his impressions, and published lithographs based on these observations which were free of sentimentality. He associated much there with Charlet, the lithographer and caricaturist. In 1821, while still in England, he painted &quot;The Derby of Epsom&quot;.

==Later life==
After his return to France in 1821, Géricault was inspired to paint a series of ten portraits of the insane. These were the patients of a friend, Dr. Étienne-Jean Georget (a pioneer in psychiatric medicine), with each subject exhibiting a different affliction. There are five remaining portraits from the series, including &quot;Insane Woman&quot;.

The paintings are noteworthy for their bravura style, expressive realism, and for their documenting of the psychological discomfort of individuals, made all the more poignant by the history of insanity in Géricault&#x27;s family, as well as the artist&#x27;s own fragile mental health. His observations of the human subject were not confined to the living, for some remarkable still-lifes—painted studies of severed heads and limbs—have also been ascribed to the artist.

Géricault&#x27;s last efforts were directed toward preliminary studies for several epic compositions, including the &quot;Opening of the Doors of the Spanish Inquisition&quot; and the &quot;African Slave Trade&quot;. The preparatory drawings suggest works of great ambition, but Géricault&#x27;s waning health intervened. Weakened by riding accidents and chronic tubercular infection, Géricault died in Paris in 1824 after a long period of suffering. His bronze figure reclines, brush in hand, on his tomb at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, above a low-relief panel of &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot;.

<doc id="511579" wikidata="Q15145" url="?curid=511579" title="José Batlle y Ordóñez">
<text>José Pablo Torcuato Batlle y Ordóñez ( or ; 23 May 1856 – 20 October 1929), nicknamed &quot;Don Pepe&quot;, was a prominent Uruguayan politician who served two terms as President of Uruguay for the Colorado Party. Born in Montevideo, he was the son of a former president and was widely praised for the introduction of his political system, Batllism, to South America and for his role in modernizing Uruguay through his creation of extensive welfare state reforms.

In 1898, Batile served as interim president for a few weeks. He was later elected to the presidency for two terms: from 1903 to 1907 and from 1911 to 1915. He remains one of the most popular Uruguayan presidents, mainly due to his role as a social reformer. Influenced by Krausist liberalism, he is known for influencing the introduction of universal suffrage and the eight-hour workday, as well as free high school education. He was one of the main promoters of Uruguayan secularization, which led to the separation of the state and the Catholic Church. Education started a process of great expansion from the mid-to-late 19th century onward. It became the key to success for the middle class community. The state established free high school education and created more high schools through the country. The University of the Republic was also opened to women, and educational enrollment increased throughout the country. Batlle also &quot;revitalized the Colorado party and strengthened its liberal tradition, giving way to ideas of general and universal interest, and favoring the right of the working class to organize and put forward just demands.&quot;

Government intervention in the economy increased during Batlle&#x27;s time in office. Montevideo&#x27;s electric power plant was nationalized, a move Batlle justified in the context of his &quot;interest in the widest diffusion and distribution of all classes of services that are presently considered necessary for the general welfare, comfort, and hygiene.&quot; As one study noted, Batlle intended the power plant &quot;to be only the first of a set of state enterprises that would provide low-cost services, simultaneously saving the public money and keeping Uruguayan capital from being shipped abroad as profits by foreign companies operating in the country.&quot; In 1911, the administration nationalized BROU, a savings and loan institution that monopolized the printing of money, while also establishing industrial institutes for geology and drilling (coal and hydrocarbon explorations), industrial chemistry, and fisheries. In 1914, the administration purchased the North Tramway and Railway Company, which later became the State Railways Administration of Uruguay. In agriculture, a number of government institutes were established &quot;dedicated to technological research and development in the fields of livestock raising, dairying, horticulture, forestation, seeds, and fodder&quot;. A protectionist policy for industry was also pursued, with the government imposing, as noted by one study, &quot;tariffs on foreign products, favoring machinery and raw materials imports, and granting exclusive licensing privileges to those who started a new industry&quot;. Indigenous companies also emerged, although foreign capital (especially from Britain and the United States), as noted by one study, &quot;also took advantage of the legislation and came to control the meat industry. The growth of the frigorífico meat-processing industry also stimulated the interbreeding of livestock, Uruguay&#x27;s main source of wealth.&quot;

These measures reflected Batlle&#x27;s belief that the state had a part to play in economic affairs, as he noted in a 1911 when urging the legislature to create government monopolies: &quot;Modern conditions have increased the number of industries that fall under the heading of public services ... competition has ceased to mean something invariably beneficial, monopoly is not necessarily condemnable ... The modern state unhesitatingly accepts its status as an economic organization. It will enter industry when competition is not practicable, when control by private interests vests in them authority inconsistent with the welfare of the State, when a fiscal monopoly may serve as a great source of income to meet urgent tax problems, when the continued export of national wealth is considered undesirable.&quot;

The reforms introduced under Batlle, and continued by several of his followers, would help make Uruguay a fairer society. Throughout his life, Batlle expressed his opposition to social injustices in society. On one occasion, he declared: &quot;There is great injustice in the enormous gap between the rich and the poor.&quot; In 1917, he argued: &quot;Our population may be divided into those who have received more than they deserve and those who have received less ... But this does not mean that a man is either exploited or an exploiter. The inequality is not deliberate on the part of the most fortunate.&quot; That same year, he argued: &quot;The gap must be narrowed-and it is the duty of the State to attempt that task.&quot; Batlle believed in the power of the state to reduce inequalities, stating on another occasion: &quot;Modern industry must not be allowed to destroy human beings. The State must regulate it to make more happy the life of the masses.&quot;

==Early life and background==
Batlle was born in Montevideo on 23 May 1856 to Lorenzo Batlle y Grau and Amalia Ordoñez. Batlle&#x27;s grandfather, José Batlle y Carreó, had arrived in Montevideo on his own ship with Batlle&#x27;s grandmother from Sitges, a town near Barcelona, and built a flour mill which won a contract to provision the Royal Spanish Navy in Montevideo. Batlle&#x27;s grandfather was loyal to the Spanish crown through both the British invasions of the River Plate and the first and second attempts to secure Uruguayan independence from Spain led by José Gervasio Artigas, and subsequently returned to Spain in 1814, and the rest of the Batlle family followed in 1818. Batlle&#x27;s grandmother died in Sitges in 1823, and his grandfather subsequently returned to Montevideo in 1833 to reopen the flour mill. Batlle&#x27;s father Lorenzo had been born in Uruguay in 1810, and returned the Montevideo three years before the rest of the family in 1830, after an extensive education in France and Spain. Batlle&#x27;s father quickly joined and became prominent within the Colorados, and was involved in the Uruguayan Civil War, notably personally escorting Fructuoso Rivera to exile in Brazil in 1847. Lorenzo Batlle married Batlle&#x27;s mother, the daughter of another Colorado guerrilla, during the Uruguayan Civil War.

The Batlle family were (prominent figures) within the Colorado Party, with five of Batlle&#x27;s relatives serving as president. Batlle&#x27;s father Lorenzo had served as Minister of War during the Great Siege of Montevideo, and was elected President of Uruguay in 1868 when Batlle was 12 years old. Batlle&#x27;s children César, Rafael and Lorenzo were actively engaged in politics, with César and Lorenzo serving in. He was also the uncle of another Uruguayan president, Luis Batlle Berres, and the great-uncle of President Jorge Batlle, and his uncle-in-law Duncan Stewart served as acting president for three weeks in 1894.

After attending an English school in Montevideo, Batlle began studying at the University of the Republic. At university, he became involved in the discussions and debates between the &#x27;idealists&#x27; and &#x27;positivists&#x27;. Led by Prudencio Váquez y Vega, Batlle was a prominent member of the idealists. Batlle&#x27;s political ideology was influenced by the work of philosopher Heinrich Ahrens, whose work was introduced to Batlle by Váquez y Vega. Ahrens &#x27;Course of Natural Law,&#x27; as one study noted, &quot;exalted the human personality and made proposals for the reform of society based on the innate dignity of man.&quot; Batlle acknowledged a great debt later in life to Váquez y Vega, writing in 1913 on the title page of a gift copy of Ahrens &quot;in this great work I formed my criterion of the law and it has served me as a guide in my public life.&quot; Batlle left university in 1879 without completing his law degree, and the following year a 24-year-old Batlle convinced his father to let him study for a year in Paris, where he took a course in English and sat in on philosophy lectures at the Sorbonne and Collège de France before returning home when money ran out.

Batlle also became a prominent journalist. In 1878 Batlle and a friend founded a raionalistic journal, &#x27;El Espíritu Nuevo,&#x27; whose mission was &quot;the total emancipation of the American spirit from the tutelage of the Old World.&quot; Batlle contributed scientific articles and poetry to the review, and later that year started contributing articles to a Montevideo newspaper. His first article, published 3 days before he turned 23, was an attack on the dictatorship of Colonel Lorenzo Latorre. In 1881 Batlle assumed the editorship of La Razon to oppose the government of General Santos. Batlle was exposed to all kinds of threats until one night his house was assaulted and an attempt made against the life of his father at whom shots were fired but which fortunately missed their mark.

In 1885, Batlle returned to the journalistic field in company with the famous journalist Dr. Teofilo D. Gil. He and Gil devoted themselves to preparing the public sentiment for a revolutionary outbreak. As noted by one study, however, &quot;Hardly had the opportunity arrived when Batlle, who had started with Rufino T. Dominguez the organization of the first battalion of volunteers, abandoned the pen of the journalist, emigrated to Buenos Aires, and devoted himself exclusively to the work of a soldier, until the unfortunate issue of the struggle at Quebracho.&quot;

In 1886, Batlle founded the newspaper &quot;El Día,&quot; which he used as a political platform for criticizing his opponents and promoting his reformist agenda. That same year Batlle undertook a campaign in &quot;El Día&quot; on behalf of the children in an orphan asylum and of pauper maniacs in an insane asylum. This campaign, one study noted, &quot;had the excellent result of depriving the City Council of Montevideo of the control of public charity and entrusting it to a commission of distinguished citizens.&quot; When a new revolutionary movement started at Buenos Aires, Batlle removed there to act as secretary to Colonel Galeano. However, the movement died in its inception, and returning to Montevideo Batlle again assumed the editorship of &quot;El Día&quot;. By March 1887 however, as noted by one study, &quot;Batlle was ready to launch upon a new aspect of his life&#x27;s work, that of reorganizing and revivifying the Colorado Party.&quot; Batlle&#x27;s time in the journalistic battle had convinced him that the Colorado Party still had a &quot;powerful vitality&quot; but had been seriously discredited and comprised by several dictatorships carrying the Colorado label. As noted by one study, &quot;Batlle was convinced that the Colorado Party &quot;must recover its prestige&quot; so that the country could enter an era that he characterized as &quot;institutional truth, fruitful freedom, order and solid and enlightened progress.&quot; Faced with the lack of structure of the Colorado Party in 1903, the elected President of the Republic became its natural guide, since his influence was decisive for the appointments of candidates and Political Leaders; and Batlle used that power to promote numerous changes in the party organization.&quot;

==Political career==
Batlle&#x27;s political career began in 1887, when he was appointed as the of department of Minas. His appointment was short-lived, for he resigned after six months to seek election to the Chamber of Deputies as a candidate on the Colorado ticket. After a disagreement with then-president Máximo Tajes, however, Batlle lost his spot on the ticket. Following his departure to Minas, &quot;El Día&quot; stopped publishing, but Batlle reopened the paper in 1889 to support the campaign of Julio Herrera y Obes for the presidency, whose financial support helped Batlle reopen the paper. The new &quot;El Día&quot; sold at 2 cents a copy on the streets. As noted by one study, it was &quot;the first street sale of newspapers in Uruguay, the first newspaper whose aim was mass readership.&quot; The presidency of Herrera y Obes disappointed Batlle however, with one study noting that

&quot;Batlle had been working to reorganize the Colorado Party so that it could win real elections and name presidents. Herrera y Obes saw the party’s role differently it should be the instrument of the president, not his superior; the power of the government, not the broad base of the party, would win the elections. When Herrera y Obes proceeded to name the Colorado candidates for the legislature, Batlle broke with the President. And when Idiarte Borda continued Herrera y Obes’ political tactics and combined them with overt corruption, Batlle erupted in Colorado party meetings and in the press. The young grocery clerk who assassinated Borda in ’97, during Saravia’s revolution, had been inspired, he said, by the bitter articles against the President in opposition newspapers, but evil tongues insisted that Batlle’s connection with the assassination was more direct than merely writing blistering press editorials.&quot;

Batlle turned his support to Juan Lindolfo Cuestas, whom Batlle saw as an opportunity to have free elections and remake the Colorado Party along the lines Batlle had long preached. Batlle would become President of the National executive Committee of the Colorado Party, or at least the pro-Cuestas faction of the party. He was eventually elected in 1891 as a deputy for the department of Salto, and quickly rose to further prominence within the Colorado party. Batlle started organizing Colorado party clubs based on &quot;grass-roots&quot; democratic assemblies, and towards the end of 1895 circumstances led to Batlle adopting a pro-labor attitude that he would hold for the rest of his life. Montevideo workers who sought to improve their wages and reduce their working hours (which were 15–19 hours daily) organized and went on strike. The government, made up of Batlle&#x27;s own Colorado party, denounced the strikers as &quot;rebellious workers&quot; and brought all of its force to bear to break the strike The strikers were strongly supported by Batlle and &quot;El Día&quot;, where Batlle wrote &quot;if this working day ought to be considered suicide for the workers, it is, on the part of the employer, an assassination.&quot; &quot;El Día&quot; started a permanent department called &quot;The Working Man&#x27;s Movement&quot; as a forum for the employed classes. Batlle continued his ruminations through his years as a Colorado politician. On one occasion, while confiding some of his ruminations with Julio Herrera y Obes (while Batlle was still on good terms with him) the latter replied, astounded &quot;Why, man, you&#x27;re a socialist!&quot; Similarly, Cuestas, who didn&#x27;t trust Batlle entirely, described him as such &quot;This citizen is a young man of 45, well educated, the son of the late President Batlle, a newspaperman by profession, a revolutionary political agitator, a very tall man with the muscles of a Roman gladiator. He is popular with the politically active elements of the younger generation. He is not accepted by conservative opinion.&quot;

Despite this, Cuestas did not veto Batlle&#x27;s candidacy for the presidency as his government still needed the Colorado political support Batlle contributed. However, Cuestas had no intention of allowing Batlle to succeed him, instead wanting a successor who would continue his cardinal principles, strict economy and conciliation of the Nationalists. Cuestas had in mind his Minister of Government, Eduardo MacEachen, who was a substantial landowner and prominent member of the conservative classes. In the end, Batlle would go on to succeed Cuestas as president to put in place policies that tackled the numerous social issues facing Uruguay.

===Senate===
Batlle was elected as a senator for Montevideo Department in November 1898, and rapidly became President of the Senate of Uruguay. As the President of the Senate was (at the time) the first in line to the presidency, Batlle briefly served as the acting President of Uruguay while Juan Lindolfo Cuestas stepped aside to legitimate his &quot;de facto&quot; presidency in 1899. While President of the Senate Batlle was, according to one study, &quot;second-ranking elective official in the country, until a coalition of conservative Colorados and Blancos expelled him from the post in 1900. He continued his organizational and ideological efforts within the party, however, with much success, so that in 1903 he finally became the President of the Republic. The country&#x27;s highest post allowed him nearly full control of public policy and the opportunity to forward his broad program of social and economic reform.&quot;

At elections in 1900, however, the Colorados performed poorly, and dissident Colorado senators elected Juan Carlos Blanco Fernández as President of the Senate by one vote. Batlle would later briefly regain the position of President of the Senate in February 1903 before becoming President of the Republic.

===First presidency (1903–07)===

====Revolution of 1904====

In 1904 Batlle&#x27;s government forces successfully ended the intermittent Uruguayan Civil War which had persisted for many years, when the opposing National Party leader Aparicio Saravia was killed at the battle of Masoller. Without their leader, Saravia&#x27;s followers abandoned their fight, starting a period of relative peace.

====Social reforms====
During Batlle y Ordóñez&#x27;s term in office, secularization became a major political issue. Uruguay banned crucifixes in hospitals by 1906, and eliminated references to God and the Gospel in public oaths. Divorce laws were also established during this time. A number of other projects were approved during Batlle&#x27;s first presidency, such as an increase in resources allocated to teaching, the contracting of a loan of for the construction and improvement of roads, free distribution of seeds and clothing to poor farmers, the permanent sale of seeds on behalf of the State, the creation of the Faculties of Veterinary Medicine and Agronomy, and the creation of colonies on expropriated estates in Paysandú. According to one study, the modifications introduced to the initial proposal made the expropriation impossible. In 1904 an Education Pension Fund established in 1896 was extended to include the administrative employees of the school system. That same year, a Civil Service Pension Fund was set up that was aimed at regularizing the civil-service pension system &quot;while expanding both coverage and benefits.&quot; The Assembly modified the retirement and civil pension system in this way:

&quot;Public employees who have more than 10 years of service and are unable to continue due to illness, disability or advanced age; employees who, after having served the same number of years, cease due to termination of employment or exoneration, not due to omission or crime; and those with more than 30 years of service and 60 years of age. The mother, the widow and the minor and unmarried children of public employees are entitled to a pension. The Fund is integrated with the help of a monthly fee of 6,000 pesos paid by the State, (doubled later), the monthly discount of one day&#x27;s salary for employees (5% later) and other lesser taxes. The funds will be invested in public debt securities. Retirement will be as many thirty-thirds of the average salary that the employee has enjoyed in the last five years, as long as the years of service rendered. The pension in favor of the relatives of the employee, will be half of the retirement, Retirements and pensions can not be seized or disposed of.&quot;

In 1903, the executive branch had to &quot;actively attend to the seed supply service in various agricultural regions of the country&quot;, which had punished by drought and the subsequent loss of crops. Stimulated by the first successes of the distribution, it authorized the Department of Livestock and Agriculture to establish a Seed Station on the fiscal lands of Toledo. A later year, the Assembly enacted a law &quot;authorising the Executive Branch to allow the free importation of seeds for three years&quot;. The subsequent losses of agriculture gave rise &quot;to the Public Powers intensifying their stimulating action&quot; with a 1906 law authorizing the government to help abandoned farmers with food and seeds. A supplementary credit of 50,000 pesos was allocated for this purpose. In 1904, the Executive Power appointed a commission in charge of drawing up a protection plan for morally and materially destitute minors. In July 1903, a resolution was sent by Defense Minister Jose Serrato to the General directorate of Public Instruction, creating night courses for adults. In 1906, departmental high schools were created.

Batlle&#x27;s time in office also saw the improvement of roads, the construction of bridges and ports, the navigation of some important interior rivers, the creation of the Veterinary and Agronomy Schools, the construction of school buildings worth $1,000, 000, the improvement of many services, the start of construction of the Pereira-Rossell Children&#x27;s Hospital and the inauguration of the Military Hospital. In 1905, Batlle negotiated and obtained from the Assembly the abolition of 10% and 5% reductions on salaries of less than $360 a year. A decree established the Central Board of Aid, &quot;under whose supervision the National Charity Commission acted, in the relief and hospitalization of the wounded and sick of the civil war of 1904.&quot; A law that authorized the introduction of electric traction in the trams of La Comercial had been vetoed by the Government of Battle&#x27;s predecessor Cuestas in 1902 on the grounds that the traction systems were in their infancy and that the term of 75 years was excessively long. One of the first measures of Batlle&#x27;s administration consisted in the withdrawal of that veto, and thanks to this the work began immediately. The Executive Power justified this decision by arguing that the change of traction was a progress that Montevideo demanded and that it would have &quot;effective repercussions in the improvement of the housing of the working class, due to the ease with which he will be able to transpose daily the distances that separate the habitual center of occupations from the localities where land ownership can still be obtained relatively cheaply.&quot;

Sanitation works were also carried out, while yielding to the exhortation of the Executive Power, the Charity Commission granted the &quot;Uruguayan League against Tuberculosis&quot; a monthly subsidy of $2,000 which the same Executive Power obtained after it was raised to $3,000, invoking the importance of the work undertaken by the League. The Conversion and Public Works Loan Law passed in 1906 earmarked $1,000,000 for school construction. That amount was reinforced with $200,000 and later with $300,000 during Battle&#x27;s second administration. The university curriculum was expanded, foreign professors and technicians were brought in, and scholarships for study in Europe and the United States were set up. University expansion also took place. A decree authorized a long-needed house-to-house property reassessment of Montevideo; &quot;the decree required land to be evaluated separately from improvements.&quot; For the first time, army and police uniforms were required to be made from Uruguayan cloth, while the government also stipulated the piece rate paid the seamstresses who sewed the uniforms. Under a law of the 27th September 1906 the name of an enterprise was changed to Usina Eléctrica de Montevideo, &quot;with exclusive privilege of selling electric light and power in Montevideo for twenty years.&quot; The Executive was given power to fix rates, while profits &quot;after setting aside 15 per cent for reserves, were to go to the Junta Económico-Administrativa de Montevideo. The Act’s original purpose had been to enable the Usina to meet power requirements, but the law was passed on the promise of lower lighting rates and better service on the insistence of the Cámara de Representantes.&quot;

Various developments in Public Assistance also took place during Batlle’s first presidency. As noted by a 1905 presidential message

&quot;In the past year, the National Charity Commission has had to attend, apart from the ordinary services entrusted to it by law, the numerous wounded and sick from the armed forces, and provide the mobilized corps and the organized expeditions with by the Central Aid Board, the healing elements and the necessary medicines. This extraordinary attention has not prevented, however, the continuation of the expansion and improvement plan begun in previous years, among them worthy of mention the completion and fitting out of the new women&#x27;s department in the Asylum for Beggars and Chronic People; the expansion of the infirmary of the Asylum for Foundlings and Orphans; the inauguration of electric lighting in the Hospital; several sanitation works in the Isolation House and other works, although of less importance, all tending to improve the hygienic conditions of the Nursing Homes and Hospices. The National Commission has also cooperated with its revenues to support the Dispensaries of the Anti-Tuberculosis League and some departmental hospitals, and has contributed, by dispensing prescriptions free of charge, to the action of Home Public Assistance and various philanthropic societies.&quot;

In a 1906 presidential message, other developments in public charity, hygiene and health were noted:

&quot;After having fulfilled the primary duty of rendering solicitous care to the sick wounded of the last conflict, the Government has devoted its attention to the improvement of this important branch, and hopes to obtain satisfactory results. During this period, the National Council of Hygiene sponsored the project of one of its members on the creation of establishments called &#x27;Gota de Leche,&#x27; so beneficial to the health of children and to the education of mothers because it provides them with resources and knowledge to raise their children properly. This mission was entrusted to the National Commission of Charity and efforts will be made to complete it through a law that protects newborns and prevents their mothers from abandoning them when exercising the profession of wet nurses. By continuing to apply the current international sanitary agreement, said Council planned to establish a disinfection center in the port, and by accepting said project, the Government offered to provide a credit of $32,000 to be repaid. In addition, said Council was authorized to acquire a steamer equipped with the necessary apparatus for the maritime health service. It was proposed to create the post of terrestrial health inspector whose mission will be to travel to any point in the Republic where an epidemic develops in order to adopt the appropriate measures with due authority and competence. At present, a project to reform the organic law of the Council, the formation of the &#x27;Codex medicamentarius&#x27; and several regulations that have to complete the health service are being studied. For the rest, the sanitary state of the Republic is excellent and the municipal authorities cooperate with the National Council of Hygiene to improve all this service and ensure that the ordinances are strictly applied and that a true zeal is shown in combating contagious diseases.&quot;

====Proposals for labor reform====

A progressive supporter of labor rights, Batlle also presided over a number of pro-labor policies. Batlle had identified his Colorado Party with labor, stating in April 1887, regarding a demonstration that was organized in Montevideo &quot;It is true : in the Colorado Party, the element of the people predominates, the working classes.&quot; In a speech he made during his first presidency, Batlle described his Colorado Party as one that was concerned with peoples&#x27; well-being, stating that &quot;I cannot accompany you in supporting the motto that you carry &quot;Down with peace&quot;, because my duty as President of the Republic is to guarantee peace and harmony, because peace means advancement, progress, the well-being of the people, which is the true motto of the Colorado Party. I declare that if I had been brought to this position to provoke the war, I would not have accepted it; but I can guarantee that in this conflict, in which the Nation has been so unjustly involved, I will preserve by all legal means the Colorado Party&#x27;s stay in power, which currently means the stability of the constitutional order, making an effort at the same time to avoid bloodshed, the ruin of national wealth and all the horrors that civil content brings, as an obligatory procession. It is not enough for the Party to have power, it is necessary to govern to do good, it is necessary to govern with honor for the same.&quot; One 1913 study reflected this view, stating that (in relation to the late Nineteenth Century) &quot;In the proximity of the &#x27;73 elections, and as always, his first act was to formulate a concise exposition of ideas that honors our party annals. This was the obsessive concern of our party, to root more and more in the field of law, freedom and social justice.&quot;

During Batlle&#x27;s first presidency regulations on police procedure during strikes were promulgated for the first time. Police had to remain neutral, protecting both the right to strike and the right to work. Also for the first time during Batlle&#x27;s first presidency on May Day labor demonstrators were granted police permits to parade through the center of Montevideo. According to one study &quot;They sang the Internationale and heard fiery speeches. One speaker exulted that Uruguay now led South America in modern ideas because of its President’s liberalism.&quot; On another occasion during his first presidency, Batlle helped resolve a rail strike. This occurred after a union formed by railroad workers made a list of demands that the railroad rejected, including dismissal payments to men over 50 who were discharged, 2 days off with pay every month, wages of 80 pesos a month for locomotive engineers and 1 peso and 20 cents a day for manual laborers, and an 8-hour day 6 months a year and a 10-hour day the other 6 months. Claudio Williman, the railroad&#x27;s former attorney, was sent by Batlle to offer himself as mediator. As noted by one study, the railroad &quot;knew Batlle’s pro-labor sympathies, verified by Williman’s presence, and accepted most of the striker’s demands, It drew a line at recognizing the union, but promised to take back the strike leaders in due time-a remarkable concession. The jubilant strikers returned to work.&quot;

Batlle also prepared a labor reform project aimed at improving working conditions, although legislative realities delayed the time in which he submitted this to the legislature for consideration. According to one study, &quot;One reason why Chamber debate on divorce and kindred bills had been allowed to drag was the certainty that the Senate, as presently constituted, would not be disposed to their passage.&quot; Following senate elections in 1906, the Executive sent Batlle&#x27;s labor project to the legislature. Explaining in a post-election interview why he had held the bill back for so long, Batlle stated that

&quot;I have worked to prepare a plan of social reforms, all designed to look after and to liberate the working classes. But you must realize that up to now we have had a Senate composed of good patriots, but conservatives. The new Senate, on the other hand, will be entirely liberal and will not put obstacles in the way of the reforms. The workers already know that they will find protection in the government. I believe – in effect – that in countries like ours, where the problem of liberty is already resolved, it is necessary to begin to resolve social problems.&quot;

The project provided for an eight-hour limit &quot;in the strenuous and intensive occupations and ten hours in the less exacting commercial occupations&quot; while a one-year transition period was provided &quot;during which an additional hour per day was permitted.&quot; It also provided for regulation of the labour of women and children, a weekly rest day, and prohibition of the labour of women for four weeks after child-birth &quot;during which period the State would provide suitable financial support.&quot; The bill&#x27;s main objective was the eight-hour day but despite having a workable majority in Congress &quot;he was unable to persuade his party to accept this radical innovation.&quot; On 26 June 1911 a new labor bill was sent to Congress by Batlle which provided for an eight-hour day &quot;without the intermediate period of one year established in his earlier bill and with broadened coverage,&quot; repeated provisions as to weekly rest and child labour, and increased the compulsory period of rest after child-birth to forty-five days. On 31 May 1913 the Chamber approved in general Batlle&#x27;s project modified by its Labor Commission, with provisions on child labor and women&#x27;s work left aside to include them in a separate project, as well as the day of rest. A Chamber Committee had left out these provisions to simplify passage and Batlle, according to one study, &quot;to close off accusations of Godless crackpotism, acknowledged that the one-day-in-six provision was &quot;an aspiration for the future,&quot; and agreed to the committee&#x27;s procedures. The chamber leadership knew what Batlle wanted, and the Chamber voted down requests for delay for additional documentation.&quot; The Chamber voted 44 in favor and 8 against. As discussions in the House developed, several conservative Colorado legislators tried to reactivate a proposal to increase the working day by 3 hours through a contract, but that initiative was rejected. By voice vote, with the result being sufficiently close for Gregorio L. Rodríguez (the deputy who put forward the 3 hour overtime provision as an amendment) to call for a second vote, overtime was defeated. In the Senate, however, approval was hindered until the chambers were renewed on 17 November 1915, when the project was finally voted affirmatively.

====New Colorado platforms====

Various Colorado Party platforms were also drafted and/or adopted during Batlle’s first presidency. In September 1905 the Colorado Executive Committee and the Colorado legislators entrusted Pedro Manini Rios (the leader of the young Colorados) to draft a pre-electoral manifesto that would serve as a party program. Manini summed up Colorado accomplishments in 40 years of power and outlined a 5-point program. This included constitutional reform, concern for labor, economic self-sufficiency, increase of rural population, and reduction of taxes on consumption. As noted by one study however, &quot;None of the points proposed anything specific. For example, the labor plank invoked the standard consoling fiction “It is an exaggeration to present these problems in our society in the almost dreadful terms in which they are agitated … in some European societies.&quot; In 1907 Jose Espalter was tasked with drawing up a party program that would include constitutional refor, separation of Church and State, municipal autonomy, and labor legislation. The program favored reduction of consumption taxes and the enacting of progressive taxation, not of the magnitude that would despoil private fortunes but rather &quot;a limited and moderate progression, whose rate oscillates between certain limits.&quot; In addition, the State had a right to intervene in labor questions, but &quot;It is a matter of elevated inspiration and exquisite tact.&quot; At the end of the Batlle&#x27;s first government in February 1907, the National Convention of the Colorado Party met and formulated a declaration of principles. These were &quot;Reform of the Constitution; universal suffrage, that is, authorization to vote in favor of all citizens; election of the President of the Republic directly by the people; proportional representation of the parties; autonomous municipalities; the rights of assembly and association are not expressly enshrined in the Constitution and that gap must be filled; separation: of Church and State; easy naturalization of foreigners; decrease in consumption taxes, establishing instead a progressive tax; solution of problems related to capital and labor, within the limits of justice, law and freedom.&quot;

====Activities following the first presidency====

Following the end of his first presidency, Batlle went on an extended tour of Europe and other foreign parts. One of Batlle&#x27;s main purposes was to study Europe&#x27;s political and economic problems. He also headed the Uruguayan delegation to the Second Hague Conference, where he proposed a plan for a society of nations to maintain peace. After the conference adjourned Batlle visited Switzerland; becoming familiar with the contributions that country made to the science of government. By December 1909, agitation was begun by the Colorado Party to make him their candidate in 1911. A small conservative anti-Batlle sentiment within the Colorado Party &quot;was lost in a growing tide of enthusiasm for a renomination.&quot; On July the 3rd 1910 Batlle&#x27;s candidacy was unanimously proclaimed by the party&#x27;s national committee. Batlle stated in a letter to the party&#x27;s committee while he was in Europe the kind of platform he could stand for. Apart from his reiterated advocacy of an eight-hour day, Batlle &quot;took a stand for popular instead of legislative election of the national president; for proportional representation of parties in the congress; for assurance of such workers’ rights as those to life, health, and culture; for full protection of children, women, the ill, and the aged; for free and assisted immigration; for free public instruction in all its levels and obligatory education at the elementary level; for assistance to stock raising and agriculture and the stimulation of national industry; for the organization by the state of all services social interest.&quot; According to one study, &quot;Truly it was a broad platform, hewn to a political design far in advance of its time.&quot;

===Second presidency (1911–15)===

In 1913, influenced by visiting and studying French and Swiss politics between his first and second terms, Batlle proposed a reorganization of the government which would replace the presidency with a nine-member National Council of Administration, similar to the Swiss Federal Council. Batlle&#x27;s proposal for a collective leadership body was defeated in 1916 referendum, but he managed to establish a model in which executive powers were split between the presidency and the National Council of Administration when a variant of his proposal was implemented with the Constitution of 1918.

Further reforms were carried out during Batlle&#x27;s second presidency. As noted by one study, following the swearing in of Batlle&#x27;s ministers, &quot;that &quot;rain&quot; of projects which so disturbed conservative opinion during Batlle&#x27;s first administration again began to fall.&quot; A few days after Batlle assumed the presidency, Ramón V. Benzano (the newly appointed Mayor of Montevideo) &quot;ordered the Department of Public Health to inspect all the tenements, most of which, according to a 1906 survey, lacked light and air and space, and close those that were not improved within a year.&quot; A special labor division of the Montevideo police set up under Claudio Williman was abolished, and Batlle announced that he would reintroduce his bill providing for an 8-hour day. In order to prepare materials for the study of the labor problems, the Executive Power resolved in 1913 that the Labor Office would include a number of topics in its program such as Cost of living in relation to wages, Offer and job demand, Labor census, Situation of the worker element, Labor legislation, and Organization of employers and workers. On 17 May 1912 a law was approved providing for the creation of the Women&#x27;s Section of Secondary Education. Expansion and dissemination of physical education also took place, with a National Commission of Physical Education set up and sports places in Montevideo and in the interior established. Industrial education was expanded while free secondary and university education was introduced and departmental high schools created in the interior while a female section of secondary education was established, which managed to get many girls to go to high school.

Under a law of 21 July 1914 industrial employers, including those in state and municipal establishments, &quot;were required to install safety devices to prevent accidents in the use of machinery.&quot; The law required that &quot;dangerous machinery should be inspected, if necessary; that steam engines, wheels, and turbines be accessible only to their operators; that women and children should not be employed in the cleaning or repair of machinery in motion; that gears be shielded; that masons and painters working at a height of more than 3 metres be protected by a rail 90 centimetres on each side, etc.&quot; A 1914 law on severance pay, which referred to commercial employees, introduced two months&#x27; notice before dismissal together with compensation proportional to the years of work that the worker had in his job.

Foreign professors were hired to establish new university schools such as agronomy and veterinary medicine, agricultural and home economics courses were established for rural youth, and study missions were sent abroad. In regards to salary discounts, The Executive Branch addressed the Assembly requesting that the discount suffered by Passive Classes in general be reduced to 10%. The measure came to favor 3,739 people. The Assembly also completely abolished the 19% tax on assignments and salaries that did not exceed $660 per year and reduced that of the largest to 10%. Another law more effectively protected retirees and school pensioners. A network of popular libraries was set up, and the capital of the Bank of the Republic, which issued currency and directly loaned money to the public, was substantially increased, while a series of economic-development institutes in fishing, geological drilling, industrial chemistry, agriculture and ranching were set up. A bill that was converted into law and put into execution authorized an issue of Public Debt for the amount of $500,000 &quot;for the purchase or expropriation of land that would be divided into farms and resold on the basis of combinations with the Mortgage Bank of Uruguay.&quot; These colonization centers would be set up &quot;in the most appropriate places due to the unnatural nature of the land, its proximity to the roads of communication and transportation facilities to the centers of consumption, for which &#x27;the necessary facilities of the railways would be opportunely managed, and around the Agronomic Stations, as a means of taking advantage of the progressive impulse of the high agricultural education and the suggestive example of the experimental farms.&quot; Under an Act of January the 19th 1912 a rural credit section was established within the Bank of the Republic and the formation of local rural credit banks was authorized. By the law of 11 January 1912 the effects of a provision of 1906 that authorized the Executive to import cereal seeds for resale at cost price, free of customs duties, were extended. The Bank of the Republic was also nationalized, with previous laws paving the way for this. As noted by one study &quot;The laws of July 1907 and 17 November 1908 – sanctioned by Batllist chambers – prepared the nationalization of the Bank.&quot; Under the law of 17 July 1907, as noted by one study, &quot;$1,000,000 was transferred from the national treasury surplus to increase the capital of the Bank and by the law of 17 November 1908 it was provided that whenever the public revenues exceeded expenditures the dividends on the Bank shares held by the government were to be utilized automatically to acquire the second series of shares originally destined for public distribution.&quot;

In 1912 the government purchased control of the National Mortgage Bank &quot;and proceeded to liberalize the bank’s loan policies. More attention was given to small loans and loans on rural property.&quot; Ownership of small farms was encouraged, with the bank purchasing large tracts of land and selling them to settlers in parcels usually 60 acres or less, and purchasers of such parcels were granted a tax exemption of 10 years. According to a 1956 study, since the time the Mortgage Bank was converted from a private to a government-owned and –operated status, &quot;it has been active, though by no means monopolistic, in mortgage financing both in urban and rural areas.&quot; A State Insurance Bank was opened in 1912 which assumed a prominent role in the fields of fire and workmen&#x27;s compensation. As noted by one study, Batlle sought to centralize insurance services &quot;through a state monopoly to lower rates and increase public confidence.&quot; Under the State Insurance Bank, insurance was provided for risks such as death, labor accidents, fires, and hail.

The State Insurance Bank was established on 11 January 1912, and started operations in Fire insurance on 1 March, in workmen&#x27;s compensation 15 March, and in hail, human life, pedigreed-animal life, marine, glass, and automobile civic responsibility insurance later that year. In 1914 it initiated a campaign to promote old age provision among the poorer classes. As noted by one study, this type of insurance, known as Seguro popular, &quot;was offered without medical examination and without rigid requirements for payment of premium. The poor man was enabled &#x27;to substitute an insurance policy for a savings bank account.&#x27; With an ordinary policy he might lose by being unable to continue paying premiums due to loss of his job, but with seguro popular he could deposit money whenever he wished; in the event of becoming incapacitated he withdrew the full amount of his contributions plus 6 percent interest; if he died before the date of policy payment his savings would go to his heirs; if he lived to old age he had a permanent income.&quot; A law of 10 November 1916 &quot;provided that capital payments up to $5,000 and income up to $1,200 annually derived from seguro popular could not be attached.&quot; However, &quot;Seguro popular (really a deferred annuity with special clauses) failed to gain favour with the public and in 1936 there were less than 200 policies of that type outstanding.&quot;

Other highlights of Batlle&#x27;s reform program in 1912 included the division of the country into new military zones, creation of an institute of industrial chemistry, the promulgation of a law making the supply of electric light and power a country-wide state monopoly, a bill for suppressing bullfights, decreeing of a law of literary and artistic copyright, approval of an urbanization plan for the city of Montevideo, and the issuance of regulations for a school of nursing. Under a law of 21 October 1912, the State was given, through the Usinas Eléctricas del Estado, &quot;a monopoly of the supply of electric light and power throughout the country.&quot; Labour benefited from this decision, with the first budget of Usinas Eléctricas providing for a general increase in wages &quot;which was intended to bring the wage scale up to that of other public utilities and to offset the rising cost of living.&quot;

A law of January 1913 authorized the issuance of a loan of 500,000 pesos destined for the purchase and division of land. With the promulgation of the law of 22 January 1913, the State began its direct action &quot;which acquires or expropriates lands to sell them based on the mortgage credit to the settlers. In doing so, it seeks, undoubtedly, to eliminate by competition the colonizing companies that had little or no regard for the interests of the colonists, and that for the same reason — and especially due to the peremptory terms for repayment of the loan — led to failure to most colonizing attempts.&quot; The aforementioned law authorized the P.E. to issue a colonization loan worth 500,000 pesos, for &quot;purchase and subdivision of land for agricultural colonization.&quot; (art.2) The lots &quot;will be sold in cash or for a term of up to thirty years with a mortgage guarantee, which the P.E. can transfer to the Mortgage Bank by issuing bonds (art.3).&quot; The same Power is also authorized to expropriate the necessary lands &quot;for which purpose it is already declared of public utility&quot; (art. 4), and said lands &quot;shall be free from the payment of Real Estate Tax for a term of ten years and from executions and embargoes originating from debts contracted by the settlers before and during the first five years, except for mortgages.&quot; Also, to avoid the concentration of land, it is indicated that &quot;no settler may buy more than one farm&quot;. On 6 February 1915, by decree of the P.E., &quot;it was a matter of promoting colonization in a certain specialized sense; In effect, the Colonization Advisory Commission is authorized to buy land for forestry, granting properties with payment facilities to whoever commits to carry out forest plantations in a third of its surface.&quot;

Various developments in public assistance and child protection also took place during Batlle&#x27;s second presidency. A presidential message from 1914, for instance, noted that &quot;The function of assistance and protection of all individuals included in the law of 7 November 1910 has been carefully attended by the authorities who are in charge of fulfilling such a lofty social mission, dedicating their activities to the organization of services respective implanted in great part in the capital and that, gradually it is tried to extend to the departments of the interior. There are 11 assistance houses operating in the capital, including hospitals and asylums, and 12 hospitals, 5 aid rooms and a colony for the insane in charge of the National Public Assistance, with 25,811 individuals having received assistance in all of them during the past year, a figure which had not yet been reached in our country, which indicates the increase that the public service in question has taken.&quot; A Permanent Assistance medical service was inaugurated on March the 1st 1913, with &quot;its true importance could be appreciated, proving its undeniable usefulness, to the point that there has already been a need to expand the elements it has, in order to respond, if not in a complete way, at least very effective, to the needs of the population. The number of emergency assistance, 11,600, in just ten months of operation, is the most eloquent demonstration of the usefulness that the new service provides.&quot; Measures were adopted to relieve overcrowding in the Hospital Maciel, including the acquisition of Doecker pavilions, while &quot;The lease of the building in which the British Hospital was installed for many years was resolved, in order to expand the services of the Maciel Hospital, and thus, using that premises, and the extensions that were also made in the year 1913 in the Germán Segura Pavilion, a bit of relief has been achieved for the old Charity Hospital, even though it has not been able to stay within its hygienic proportions.&quot; In addition, other improvements &quot;can be noted in the Maciel Hospital during the past year. The transfer of the Electricity Section to another more apparent location within the same Hospital, which contemplates the most rigorous demands of science and in which a very complete installation of apparatus has been made; the installation in a place near the aforementioned establishment, of the Urinary Tract Clinic, whose service is attended by a truly extraordinary number of patients; the replacement of the current poor lighting of the surgery rooms by a system adopted with great success in the United States and in some European countries, having empowered the General Directorate to acquire the necessary equipment, and others, are important improvements made in the said hospital.&quot;

In the Vilardebó Hospital, with a capacity for 600 patients, the amount of 1,500 alienated was reached, while the women&#x27;s section, which is the one in the worst conditions, &quot;has been alleviated with the installation of the new Doecker pavilions in which about two hundred alienated women have been given lodging. As for the men section, the transfer of some one hundred to the Alienated Colony, and the adoption of other measures that will be put into practice, allow us to suppose that in the future the situation of the referred hospital will improve.&quot; Also, &quot;In the course of the past year, the existing facilities in the Alienated Colony have been completed, which were converted into large pavilions for alienated persons, having transferred to them more than 200 inmates, in unbeatable conditions, insofar as it is related to hygiene and safety. comfort they enjoy. In addition to the construction of the kitchen, dining room for the sick and related services, a Doecker pavilion with 25 beds and chalets were built for the director, administrator and butler&#x27;s homes.&quot; Ina addition, &quot;Active work has been done to complete two works of great importance: one refers to the new pavilions of the Fermín Ferreyra Hospital, which will accommodate 240 patients. These pavilions are now completely finished, and very soon they will be released to public service. The other work to which I refer is the Maternity Pavilion and Shelter for Pregnant Women, which is also expected to be enabled as soon as possible.&quot; Also, in the Asilo Dámaso Larrañaga, the construction of the classrooms, which occupy the upper part of the building facing San Salvador Street, was completed. This work, for which all requirements in terms of capacity, ventilation and light have been considered, allowed the expansion of the original, insufficient premise. Also, &quot;The benefits that are expected from the School of Nurses, and the convenience of definitively incorporating it into Public Assistance, led to the acceptance of the offer of sale made by the owners of the building in which it is installed.&quot;

In the departmental hospitals, many works were carried out by the directing authorities of Public Assistance, &quot;in order to install new services and expand the existing ones. Refurbishments have been carried out in the Molo and Salto hospital buildings, installing electric light service in them. The construction of the San Eugenio Hospital is nearing completion. The magnificent building of the Hospital de la Colonia has been completed and enabled, having transferred to it the Aid Room, which worked in precarious conditions. It is a hospital built in accordance with the modern progress of hospital hygiene. Significant improvements have been made in the Durazno Aid Room, with the construction of an operating room, a restroom and an autopsy room.&quot; Also, several ordinances &quot;with the approval of the government have been put into force in the previous period, being able to cite the one that includes epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis among those of obligatory declaration; the one that authorizes the use of a poster announcing the presence of contagious diseases; the one that declares disinfection optional in cases of measles; the one that determines certain precepts to avoid contagion of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis, etc.&quot; Other developments included the installation of a small analysis laboratory in the Prostitution Dispensary and another larger and more complete one in the &quot;Doctor Germán Segura&quot; Pavilion, &quot;which indicate an evident improvement in the health service against avariosis, since by virtue of these works, been able to place the fight against such a terrible evil on a completely scientific terrain. In the Lazaretto of the Island of Flores, a reinforced concrete tank has been built, destined to provide drinking water at all times to the personnel of the Island and to the passengers who remain there for observation. In the aforementioned Island of Flores, the reinforced concrete bridge that permanently ensures the passage between the second and third islands has been completed, a work of real importance that will render innumerable services to that Sanitary Station.&quot;

In addition, the work carried out by the Council, &quot;which is in charge of the important services that the law of 24 February 1911, places under its care, indicates an advanced step towards the definitive organization of the protection of abandoned minors. The main point of the task of a diverse nature that has concerned the aforementioned Corporation has been that related to the construction of the buildings that will serve as the seat of the two most important dependencies of the benefactor Institution: the Educational Colony for Men and the Reformatory of girls. The works of the first of the mentioned buildings, for which Your Honorability has sanctioned a law that authorizes the investment of the sum of $100,000,—promulgated on June 16 of last year,—are well advanced, since it is about to be finished. the first pavilion for asylum seekers, the second being halfway through its construction. In addition, the building that will be used for the Subdirectorate and the one that will be the house-room of the Subdirector, are already out of the foundations, and it is expected that this first section of the works will be inaugurated before the middle of the current year. Around $50,000 have been spent on the execution of the two pavilions and the Subdirectorate.&quot; Provisional constructions that had started at the end of 1912 were completed, &quot;constructions that put the old pastoral establishment in a position to regularly receive close to one hundred asylum seekers, which include: lodging, with three large bedrooms for minors, rooms for employees, dining rooms for employees and minors, kitchens, storage rooms, pantry and two rooms to teach primary instruction classes.&quot; Also, &quot;In the house that served as lodging for the owners of the old cabin and that today constitutes the seat of the central offices of the Colony, a comfortable extension of four rooms was made. In addition, the facilities of the Colony were completed with some rural constructions, pigsties, a cistern and a pool, which is supplied through. a water motor from a well for washing clothes, irrigation pipes, a box for the lighting service, enabling a small pavilion duly refurbished for nursing and medicine cabinet. These works, carried out in the old buildings that existed, and which, with the temporary extensions, have meant that the establishment for the Protection of Minors in question could be operating a year ago, have cost $13,050.&quot;

The Council also studied and resolved &quot;many points related to its mission, solving difficulties that have arisen in some cases not provided for by law, issuing consultations, regulating procedures, dealing with various projects of the Departmental Committees referring to campaign minors. , etc. Among them we can mention: the approval of a Regulation that establishes the obligation of periodic visits by the Inspectors to the minors delivered in precarious custody and the creation of a system of checkbooks destined to record the way in which the givers fulfill their mission. ; the formation of the money of the minors who work in the radio workshops assigned to them in the Prison and in the works or tasks of the Colony of Suárez; obligatory intervention of the Council in every transfer of minors to the various houses of Public Assistance, as well as for their retirement; surveillance of certain workshops against which the Council had received a complaint that they imposed excessive hours on minors; intervention of the Legal Advisor of the corporation in all the demands established by the Inspector of the Council to whom the respective power has been granted, in order to legally demand the collection of the monthly payments owed by the guardians to their wards, etc.&quot;

A presidential message from 1914 also mentioned various agricultural developments. For instance, the Agricultural Inspectors &quot;have carried out a constant work of extensive teaching, through conferences, consultations, practical lessons, contests, demonstrations, etc., in order to bring the latest agricultural advances to the same rural producer. This is a complementary task of the Agronomic Schools, whose productions can be easily appreciated, since instructing the farmer or rancher on the ground implies the immediate application of the education received for the benefit of increasing and improving rural production.&quot; Also, &quot;With the help of the publications, it has also been possible to bring new teachings to the campaign, using, instead of long-read magazines, bulletins of a few pages, with simple instructions and practices written in a style completely within the reach of our rural inhabitants. Seven of these bulletins have been published in the year, five of which have appeared after the month of September, which reveals the effort made, bringing teachings on fruit horticulture; utility, planting and care of trees; land preparation, seed selection and crop rotation; wheat pairing; orange tree cultivation, etc. These publications have circulated profusely and free of charge throughout the campaign, since the editions carried out so far exceed one hundred thousand copies. In addition, the technical personnel of the Inspection have collaborated assiduously in the Magazine of the Ministry of Industries, as evidenced by the fact that more than twenty works have appeared in that publication, and the Zone Agronomic Inspectors publish teaching articles at least every fortnight.&quot; In addition, &quot;The Seed Section is well advanced in its work to establish control over the seeds that are sold in commerce, so that farmers acquire good quality grains,—and just as the Chemistry Section has established minimum rates for that farmers and landowners can have land, seeds and rural products in general analyzed, with the benefits that can be imagined.&quot;

In 1913, in an attempt to prevent future Presidential dictatorships, Batlle proposed a collective Presidency (&quot;colegiado&quot;) based on the Swiss Federal Council model. This was offered as a way to prevent presidential dictatorship (in a nation where every person older than 13 had lived under a dictator) while also, as Batlle believed, as one study noted, assuring continuing reform &quot;because the Colorado Party, with its ongoing action program, would control the Colegiado for some years, unlike the present arrangement in which every incoming president was free to reverse or ignore his predecessor’s policies.&quot; The Colegiado proposal, however, was not welcomed by several politicians. Cabinet ministers resigned, and the majority of the Senate (despite consisting of men personally chosen by Batlle) announced that it would not bring up for debate the legislation that would enable a Constitutional Convention. An unforeseen gold crisis also struck Uruguay. As one study summed up this depressing situation: &quot;Financing businesses became difficult; financing new government projects became impossible. The Bank of the Republic’s gold holdings dropped below its charter requirements, and it stopped granting credit. Business was depressed, international trade decreased, government revenues dropped, and the budget surplus became a budget deficit. Workers’ wages kept falling, and unemployment rose. Only ranchers, whose meat, wool, and hide exports were bringing first good, and then astronomical, prices were prospering, but they were holding on to their money in these troubled times.&quot; Nevertheless, Batlle resisted economic retrenchment and quickly responded to the political crisis. He chose a new cabinet from the young and obscure members of the Colorado Party, men who were committed Colegialists. In an election held on 30 November 1914, the mainstream of the Colorados, the Colegialists, gained 60% of the votes cast, and would have 68 seats in the Chamber of Deputies as opposed to the Nationalists’ 21, while the Anticolegialists did not win a single seat.

However, the colegiado proposal was defeated in a 1916 referendum, but Batlle then managed to get support from the Blancos and the Second Constitution was approved by referendum on 25 November 1917. Under the new Constitution, a split executive was created, but the President continued to control the ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior and Defence. The new nine-man National Council of Administration, which consisted of six Colorados and three Blancos, controlled the ministries of Education, Finances, Economy and Health. Claudio Williman, who served between Batlle&#x27;s two terms, was his supporter and continued all his reforms, as did the next President Baltasar Brum (1919–23).

Batlle kept a handwritten list of how the Senators stood on the linked issues of the eight - hour day and the Colegiado . On the eight - hour day there were &quot;12 in favour, one doubtful and nothing beside the other five.&quot; Support for the Colegiado was less certain, with &quot;7 in favour, 5 against, 6 blank.&quot;

According to one study Batlle&#x27;s fight for the collegiate executive &quot;had overshadowed all else during the closing years of his greatest activity, but Batlle still found time to direct the negotiation of a number of arbitration treaties, to initiate a state-owned railway system, to sponsor a law providing equality of rights between legitimate and natural children, and to prepare a bill establishing pensions for the aged.&quot; In regards to the pensions proposal, &quot;El Día&quot; was confident of its passage, noting in an article dated 31 January 1916

&quot;The discussion of the old-age pensions project, recommended by the P.E., will continue tomorrow in the Chamber of Deputies. The colorado majority is willing to sanction it as soon as possible, without admitting delays that would hurt too much those who have begun to base hopes for a better situation on the sanction of that project.”

The same article also noted that

“The observation of the same nationalist representative that they do not have the necessary data to sanction the project lacks solid foundation. It&#x27;s true, the last census is from 1908. But that&#x27;s enough. What you need to know is not precisely the number of elderly people and taxpayers in the country. It is the numerical relationship in which they are each other. And this relationship is given as well by the 1908 census as a new one could. On the other hand, if it were necessary to wait for another census to be taken to decree pensions, it can be assured that the project would be postponed for many years.

No! The colorado majorities of the House and Senate allow these beneficent ideas to be carried out and there is no need to stop. All the men in the situation have made them, with beautiful unanimity, their program of principles, which they will not fail to carry out.”

Batlle&#x27;s constitutional reform proposals spilt the Colorado Party; a dissident wing called the riverista Colorados (named after party founder Fructuoso Rivera), according one study, &quot;went off the range on the issue of the collegiate or plural executive.&quot; They were led by Pedro Manini Rios, a Colorado who used to be close to Batlle; even drafting a law message of 8 hours and weekly rest in 1911, but broke with him. Manini asked rhetorically in 1913

&quot;Are we socialists or are we Colorados? And let&#x27;s give ourselves the clear, categorical and definitive answer. The Colorado Party in its capacity as liberal, advanced and evolutionary shares several points of the minimum socialist program, from all the secular solutions to almost all the postulates of legal improvement for the working class; but in its capacity as a party of government, order and institutional defense, it cannot share, it does not share, the purposes of social revolution that animate all socialists.&quot;

Manini even voted against the 8-hour law, despite the fact that the initial project for this measure bore his signature. However, although a more conservatively inclined group, the Riveristas called for a number of progressive policies similar to those proposed by Batlle. These included &quot;political rights and civil equality for women; the status of the public official; the Labor Code, with regulations on the work of women and minors; workers&#x27; insurance for disability; hygiene and safety in workshops; work accident insurance; measures for forced unemployment; conciliation and arbitration, as a solution to the strike; economical and hygienic rooms for urban and rural workers; improvement and development of assistance; vocational technical schools; construction of urban and rural schools, improvement of salaries and guarantees in the appointments and promotions of teaching personnel; compulsory physical education, free vocational education courses, popular libraries; reform of the tax system, deducting essential items; promotion of industries derived from the use of the country&#x27;s raw material, promotion of public works and improvement of means of transportation.&quot; On one occasion, as documented by one observer, Batlle himself said (according to La Mañana (Uruguay)) that “the Riverist Party had become imbibed with the spirit of Batllism, and stressed that Riverists and Batllists had the same party traditions, and that the Riverist Party was by no means as conservative as the traditional antagonists of the Colorados, the Nationalists.”

Other Colorado factions emerged in later years, such as Vierismo and Sosismo, both of which presented themselves as politically progressive. Sosismo identified itself with the defense of workers&#x27; rights while &quot;emphasizing the need for a Colorado agreement to overcome internal divisions and thus avoid the triumph of the whites.&quot; Vierismo characterized the National Party &quot;as a conservative, retrograde, anti-democratic, anti-liberal group, and opposed to foreigners, to social-labour rights, to workers and to the humble classes.&quot; As a manifesto of Vierismo dated the 31st of December 1919 declared, “No seromos conservadores, sino liberales, porque somos colorados, pero no somos tampoco socialistas (We will not be conservatives, but liberals, because we are colorados, but we are not socialists).”

===First presidency of the National Council of Administration (1921–1923)===
At the 1920 Uruguayan general election, Batlle was elected to his first term on the National Council of Administration. He subsequently served as its president for a two-year term from 1 March 1921 to 1 March 1923 alongside president Baltasar Brum.

During the presidency of Baltasar Brum, a project was presented by Batlle to the Batllista caucus and by it to the Legislative Body, which established that two-thirds of the profits of the State industrial companies, whose services were mainly provided by workers, would be used to raise the salaries and wages of workers and employees &quot;up to double at least the average of private services.&quot; Although it triumphed in the Chamber of Deputies, it was rejected by the Senate.

===Second presidency of the National Council of Administration (1927–1928)===
At the 1926 Uruguayan general election, Batlle was elected to a new term on the National Council of Administration. He served again as its president from 1 March 1927 for just under one year, alongside new president Juan Campisteguy, until he was succeeded by Luis C. Caviglia on 16 February 1928.

====Economic developments====

The economy did well for much of Batlle&#x27;s tenure. The peace following the end of the 1904 war, as noted by one study, &quot;encouraged ranchers, who formed the base of the country’s economy, to buy breeding stock to make up for their war losses and to buy or rent more land to pasture their livestock.&quot; The nation&#x27;s businesses started to invest in foreign companies to build miles of new railroad lines and to electrify the trolley lines in Montevideo. In his last annual message Batlle argued that:

&quot;It can be stated without hyperbole that our country has never enjoyed a prosperity superior to the present one or more complete civil and political liberty, from the time it was organized constitutionally. The national energies have been developing with increasing vigor in all economic fields, and for its part the Government has put all its zeal for the public interest into intelligently aiding the progress of the nation. Public works have received a considerable impulse; higher education is moving toward new and fruitful orientations which will widen our general culture and make our principle industries, ranching and agriculture, more scientific. Government income has increased in unprecedented fashion, permitting us to end the financial period with a budget surplus which by itself says more in honor of the Administration than any propaganda could.&quot;

===Electoral developments===
Both the Batllista wing of the Colorado Party and the Colorado Party performed well during Batlle&#x27;s presidencies, a trend that would continue in subsequent years. In the legislative election that Batlle called for in January 1905, his hand-picked candidates won the majority of seats. According to one study, &quot;It was the first election in thirty years in which the outcome was not predetermined.&quot; In the 1905 elections for the House of Diputados, Batlle&#x27;s sector the Batllistas won 57.7% of the vote. In subsequent elections for the House of Diputados and the Constituency Assembly the Batllistas continued to perform well, winning 64.2% of the vote in 1907, 79.9% of the vote in 1910, 60% of the vote in 1913, 45.2% of the vote in 1916, 49.3% of the vote in 1917, 29.5% of the vote in 1919, and 52.2% of the vote in 1920. Also, in the elections of 1905, 1907 and 1913, in nineteen departments Batllismo won in seventeen. According to one observer &quot;Batllismo, from 1911 to 1915, was all-powerful, dominated absolutely in the Chamber of Deputies, it had some reservations in the Senate. There was not a single nationalist representative in the Senate at that time.&quot; As noted by one study, &quot;Until 1917, Batllismo dominated the successive elections and obtained its best result in 1910 with 79.9 % of the votes.&quot; As noted by another study, &quot;The institutional difficulty resulting from the complex reading of the results was apparently not immediately perceived by contemporaries, but it came to the forefront when in January 1917 the legislative elections held according to the traditional rule of public vote gave Batlle back control of both chambers.&quot; One study has noted that 1917 &quot;Batllismo had the majority in the chambers that it lacked in the Constituent Assembly.&quot;

==Later life==
In early 1920 Batlle killed Washington Beltrán Barbat, a National Party deputy, in a formal duel that stemmed from vitriolic editorials published in Batlle&#x27;s &quot;El Día&quot; newspaper and Beltrán&#x27;s &quot;El País&quot;. His son Washington Beltrán would become President of Uruguay. He also served twice as Chairman of the National Council of Administration (1921–1923, 1927–1928).

After suffering abdominal pain for some time, Battle admitted himself to the Italian Hospital of Montevideo on 18 September 1929 for the first of two planned operations. While Batlle had made somewhat of a recovery a month later (with the second operation planned for another two or three months later), he had suffered some setbacks. Around midday on 20 October, Battle suffered the first of two thromboembolisms, with the second one later that afternoon proving fatal.

==Legacy==


The first implementation of the system which Batlle had championed, the National Council of Administration, was overthrown in a coup by president Gabriel Terra in 1933 and abolished by the third Constitution of Uruguay in 1934, a little over four years after Batlle&#x27;s death. The idea of the system remained influential, however, and was reintroduced with the 1952 Constitution of Uruguay in the form of the National Council of Government. The National Council of Government fully abolished the presidency, making it closer to Batlle&#x27;s desired system, but was itself abolished for a second time and the presidency re-established by the 1967 constitution.

In addition to his reforms, Batlle also succeeded in moving his Colorado Party in a more progressive direction, with one study arguing that

&quot;The revitalization of the Colorado party was one of the early accomplishments of the great Batlle y Ordóñez. Sterility, a creeping cynicism, the incubus of the military dictatorships of recent years, all combined to put the Colorado party in almost as unenviable a position as that occupied by the Blancos. Batlle sold his party on its need for idealism and a program of reform, on the importance of intra-party democracy, discipline, and cohesiveness. The Colorado program, as Batlle thus evolved it, might have been a Latin archetype for the pattern of the New Deal in the United States a generation later.&quot;

According to one study,

&quot;During the first quarter of the twentieth century mass democracy did not exist in Uruguay. The rise of José Batille y Ordoñez to the presidency in 1903 and 1911 was due largely to palace intrigue-similar to the political form Gino Germani typified as restricted democracy of notables. The parliament was made up of the old aristocracy, while during the first part of Batlle&#x27;s second presidency, when the bulk of the interventionist social assistance state appeared, it was dominated by his friends.&quot;

According to one source, Batlle was responsible &quot;for directing the liberal, democratic-independence institutional reform of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, which placed her at the head of progressive and justice achievements; and gave him great fame in the American concert.&quot;

Another study has argued that &quot;By the late 1960’s and early 1970s Colorado presidents such as Jorge Pacheco Areco and Juan Maria Bordaberry, while paying lip service to Batlle’s ideals, led right-wing administrations.”

A public park and a neighborhood in Montevideo are named after him.

There is also a town in Lavalleja Department named after him.

<text>Curtis Shayne Joseph (né Munro; born April 29, 1967) is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former professional player. Nicknamed &quot;Cujo&quot;, Joseph was immediately recognizable on the ice for his masks featuring a snarling dog, drawing inspiration from the Stephen King novel &quot;Cujo&quot;.

Throughout his NHL career, Joseph played for a number of franchises, rising to prominence during the playoffs with the St. Louis Blues, Edmonton Oilers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. He also played for the Detroit Red Wings, Phoenix Coyotes and Calgary Flames. He last played for the Maple Leafs during the 2008–09 NHL season. He was also a member of Canada&#x27;s gold medal-winning team at the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Joseph retired with the most career wins (454) of any goaltender in NHL history who never played on a Stanley Cup-winning team (which has since been surpassed by Roberto Luongo and Henrik Lundqvist, although they reached the Stanley Cup Finals once where Joseph never did), and was also the first goaltender to have 30 or more wins in a regular season for five different teams. He was also the last goaltender to have played in the NHL in the 1980s.

==Early life==
Joseph was born on April 29, 1967 to unmarried teenage parents. Soon after his birth, his mother, Wendy Munro, gave him up to be fostered by Jeanne and Howard Eakins. She knew Jeanne from the nursing home where they both worked and thought that the Eakinses could provide a better life for him. He was named Curtis after his birth father, Curtis Nickle. Jeanne later divorced Howard and married Harold Joseph, at which point she cut off contact with Wendy Munro and began using Joseph as Curtis&#x27;s last name. In the Joseph household, Curtis grew up with two older stepbrothers, Grant and Victor. He also has three older stepsisters and a stepbrother from a previous marriage. The family is of mixed race with Harold and Victor being black, and Grant also being an adopted child prior to Curtis Joseph. It was not until he signed with the St. Louis Blues that Joseph legally changed his surname from Munro to Joseph.

For the majority of his childhood, Curtis was raised in the East Gwillimbury community of Sharon. He initially attended Whitchurch Highlands Public School and then Huron Heights Secondary School. Curtis grew up playing hockey for the East Gwillimbury Eagles of the OMHA until moving west to play for Notre Dame College in (Wilcox, Saskatchewan). Although he led the Notre Dame Hounds to the Centennial Cup in 1987–88, and he played for the University of Wisconsin–Madison of the NCAA, he was undrafted by the NHL. He signed as a free agent with the Blues in 1989. In the 1989–90 season, he played 23 games with the Peoria Rivermen in the IHL.

==Playing career==
Nicknamed &quot;Cujo,&quot; Joseph has worn the number 31 for the St. Louis Blues, Edmonton Oilers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Detroit Red Wings, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Calgary Flames. Joseph is a three-time NHL All-Star (1994, 1999, 2000), and he was awarded the 1999–2000 King Clancy Memorial Trophy for exemplifying leadership qualities on and off the ice and making noteworthy humanitarian contributions to his community. In the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, he was a member of the Olympic Gold Medal winning Canadian men&#x27;s hockey team.

=== University of Wisconsin ===
Joseph began his college play at the University of Wisconsin. While playing for the Badgers, Joseph won 21 games and was voted to the WCHA All Conference Team. Shortly after his freshman season, Joseph, despite not having been drafted, was signed by the St. Louis Blues to a free-agent entry-level contract.

===NHL career===
====St. Louis Blues====
Joseph broke into the NHL in 1990, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the off-season following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind&#x27;Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph seemed to be the answer the Devils were looking for in goal, but the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.

Joseph remained with the Blues until 1995. The 1992–93 NHL season was his most successful season, as he played a key role in the upset of the Chicago Blackhawks, the reigning Clarence Campbell Conference regular season champions; the Blues swept them in four games in the first round of the playoffs. The Blues then faced the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round, and though the Leafs prevailed, the series went to seven games thanks to Joseph&#x27;s play. Because of his efforts, he was nominated as a finalist for the Vezina Trophy that season, finishing third in voting behind winner Ed Belfour and Tom Barrasso. After a disappointing first-round exit in the 1995 playoffs, St. Louis Blues coach and general manager Mike Keenan declined to re-sign Joseph and traded his rights to the Edmonton Oilers.

====Edmonton Oilers====
The Oilers began their training camp with two starting goaltenders, signed incumbent Bill Ranford and the unsigned Joseph. Edmonton failed to work out a contract or trade Joseph&#x27;s rights, leaving Joseph without a team to start the 1995–96 season. He signed a contract with the IHL&#x27;s Las Vegas Thunder and dominated, reminding the NHL that he deserved to be there. The Oilers entertained trading Joseph to the Boston Bruins but would finally sign Joseph to a contract and trade Ranford to Boston. With Edmonton, Joseph won two Zane Feldman Trophies (team MVP) and one Most Popular Player award. He backstopped the Oilers to first round playoff upsets of the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche in 1997 and 1998, respectively, their first playoff series wins since 1992.

====Toronto Maple Leafs====
Following the 1997–98 season, Joseph signed as a free agent with the Toronto Maple Leafs. While with the Leafs, he had three consecutive seasons of 30+ wins, he was twice runner-up for the Vezina Trophy in 1999 and 2000, a finalist for the Lester B. Pearson Award in 1999, and won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy in 2000. Joseph played a key role in the Leafs&#x27; run to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1999 and 2002. In 2000, during Game One of the series against the New Jersey Devils, he was considered the deciding factor in the 2–1 win where the Leafs were outshot 33–21.

After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn was unwilling to give Joseph a four-year contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated that the relationship between Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph in the Salt Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well for the rest of the tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph&#x27;s move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.

====Detroit Red Wings====

The Detroit Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in 2002 (with Dominik Hašek) and entered the 2002–03 season with the newly acquired Curtis Joseph but otherwise mostly unchanged. Detroit brought in coach Dave Lewis to replace the retiring Scotty Bowman, and signed Joseph to a 3-year, $24 million contract to replace the newly retired Dominik Hašek. Joseph initially faltered, but eventually found his form in the latter half of the 2002–03 season to backstop his team to the division title. With an anemic offense, Detroit was upset in the first round of the playoffs in 2003 by the eventual conference champions, the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in a four-game sweep. Detroit fans and media focused their frustration on Joseph after he was outplayed by the eventual 2003 Conn Smythe Trophy winner Jean-Sébastien Giguère.

During the 2003 off-season, Dominik Hašek announced his intentions to come out of retirement. With fears of Hašek signing with a competitor, Detroit general manager Ken Holland signed him to a contract with the intention of trading Joseph, but Joseph&#x27;s large contract and off-season surgery made him unmovable. Detroit was forced to enter the 2003–04 season with two starting goaltenders earning US$8 million per year. After a stint in the minors, Joseph returned to the Red Wings lineup while Hašek was nursing a groin injury. The Red Wings&#x27; plan was to keep playing Joseph to showcase him to the rest of the league until Hašek returned to the lineup. In February, Hašek decided to call it quits for the season, which once again solidified Joseph&#x27;s position on the Red Wings roster.

Detroit finished first overall in the league, and entered the first round of the playoffs with Manny Legace as their starting goalie. After great play in the first two games, Legace struggled in games 3 and 4. Joseph took the reins in game 5 and delivered, winning two straight and helping Detroit defeat the Nashville Predators in six games. The Red Wings were defeated in the second round of the playoffs in six games by the eventual Western Conference champions, the Calgary Flames. Joseph was statistically the top goaltender in the 2004 playoffs.

====Phoenix Coyotes====
In the summer of 2005, several teams were interested in signing Joseph, including the Pittsburgh Penguins and Phoenix Coyotes. After taking a call from the new Phoenix coach, Wayne Gretzky, Joseph signed a one-year deal with Phoenix. On October 28, 2005, he won his 400th NHL game. On March 28, 2006, he posted his 424th career win, thereby moving into sixth place on the NHL&#x27;s all-time list, passing Tony Esposito. In the summer of 2006, Joseph returned to Phoenix for another season on a one-year contract. While he was with the Coyotes, Joseph became the first goaltender to have 30 or more regular season wins for five different teams (St. Louis, Edmonton, Toronto, Detroit, and Phoenix); Joseph eventually recorded at least 50 regular season wins with each of those five teams.

====Calgary Flames====
Joseph had shown interest in re-joining the Toronto Maple Leafs, indicating that he would be fine with a back-up role and a reduced salary. In September 2007 the Ottawa Senators quietly expressed interest in acquiring Joseph if they could unload Martin Gerber and his large contract.

On January 14, 2008, Joseph signed a one-year, US$1.5 million contract with the Calgary Flames. On March 1, 2008, Joseph moved past Terry Sawchuk for fourth place in all-time NHL wins with 448 in a 3–1 win over his former team, the Phoenix Coyotes. On April 13, 2008, Joseph replaced Miikka Kiprusoff less than four minutes into the first period of Game #3 of the Flames&#x27; first round series of the 2008 playoffs with the San Jose Sharks. Joseph backstopped the Flames to a come-from-behind 4–3 win after initially falling behind 3–0. This win made him the first goaltender to win a post-season game as a member of five different teams: St. Louis, Edmonton, Toronto, Detroit and Calgary.

====Return to Toronto====
On July 1, 2008, Joseph rejoined the Toronto Maple Leafs by signing a 1-year, $700,000 contract. Joseph served primarily as a back-up for most of the season, only playing 21 games. On December 30, 2008, he recorded his 450th career win in a 4–3 overtime victory against the Atlanta Thrashers, and on April 8, 2009, he recorded his 352nd NHL loss, tying Gump Worsley for the NHL record for most losses by a goaltender. Martin Brodeur subsequently set a new record and subsequently finished with 397 losses, Joseph&#x27;s 352 losses were also later surpassed by Roberto Luongo who subsequently finished with 392 losses.

Joseph announced his retirement on January 12, 2010, in Toronto. His career would end with 454 regular season wins, 5th most all time. His 63 playoff victories are the most by a goaltender without winning the Stanley Cup.

During the 2016–17 season, Joseph was a goaltending consultant in the organization of the Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL.

==International play==
Joseph was a member of the Canada men&#x27;s national ice hockey team, having played for the team in several international tournaments, including the 1996 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships, the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, the 2002 Winter Olympics, and the 2007 Spengler Cup. Joseph helped lead the team to the Spengler Cup championship on December 31, 2007.

==Personal life==
Joseph has been married twice and has seven children, including a nephew he is raising with his second wife. Joseph was previously married to Nancy. The couple had four children together before divorcing in 2009. Joseph married Stephanie Glasson in 2012. In 2014 the couple gave birth to their daughter. Curtis Joseph also has a step daughter by way of his second wife.

His autobiography, &quot;Cujo: The Untold Story of My Life On and Off the Ice&quot;, was released in 2018.

Joseph is slated to be inducted into the St. Louis Blues Hall of Fame in January, 2025 along with Jim Roberts and Wayne Babych.

<doc id="511584" wikidata="Q6106384" url="?curid=511584" title="J. Lyons and Co.">
<text>J. Lyons &amp; Co. was a British restaurant chain store, food manufacturing, and hotel conglomerate founded in 1884 by Joseph Lyons and his brothers in law, Isidore and Montague Gluckstein. Lyons&#x27; first teashop opened in Piccadilly, London in 1894, and from 1909 they developed into a chain of teashops, with the firm becoming a staple of the High Street in the UK. At its peak the chain numbered around 200 cafes. The teashops provided for tea and coffee, with food choices consisting of hot dishes and sweets, cold dishes and sweets, and buns, cakes and rolls.

Making their first cakes and pastries in 1894, several Lyons cake products are still available on grocers&#x27; shelves, including Lyons&#x27; treacle tart, Lyons&#x27; Bakewell tart, Lyons&#x27; Battenberg, and Lyons&#x27; trifle sponges, which are sold by Premier Foods. The company is also known for its pioneering use of computers in the office.

==Origins and early history==
The company began as a collaboration between a group of entrepreneurs, the professional artist Joseph Lyons and his brothers in law, Isidore and Montague Gluckstein, as a spin off from the Salmon &amp; Gluckstein tobacco company. In 1894 the company started a teashop in Piccadilly, London, and from 1909 developed this into a chain of teashops which would ultimately number around 200 locations. The company also ran high class restaurants, founding the Trocadero in 1895, and hotels including the Strand Palace, opened in 1909, the Regent Palace, opened in 1915, and the Cumberland Hotel, opened in 1933, all in London. In 1918, to increase sales in northern England, Lyons bought the old established tea company Horniman &amp; Sons. From the 1930s Lyons began to develop a pioneering range of teas, biscuits and cakes that were sold in grocery stores across the world. Lyons was appointed to run the company, and it was named after him.

J. Lyons &amp; Co. was a pioneer in introducing computers to business. Between 1951 and 1963, the company manufactured and sold a range of LEO (Lyons Electronic Office) computers.

==Products and image==
The company was a substantial food manufacturer, with factories at Cadby Hall in Hammersmith, and from 1921 at Greenford, producing bread, cakes, pies, tea, coffee and ice cream. Lyons branded cakes included treacle tarts, Lyons Bakewell tart, Lyons Battenberg, and Lyons trifle sponges.

To the public, J. Lyons &amp; Co. were best known for their chain of teashops which opened from 1894 and finally closed in 1981, and for the Lyons Corner Houses in the West End of London. The teashops provided for tea and coffee, with hot dishes and sweets, cold dishes and sweets, and buns, cakes and rolls. Lyons&#x27; teashops were slightly more up market than their ABC (Aerated Bread Company) competitors. They were notable for their interior design, from the 1920s Oliver P. Bernard being consultant artistic director. Until the 1940s they had a certain working-class chic, but by the 1950s and 1960s they were quick stops for busy shoppers where one could drink a cup of tea and eat a snack or an inexpensive meal. The teashops always had a bakery counter at the front, and their signs, Art Nouveau gold lettering on white, were a familiar landmark. Before the Second World War service was to the table by uniformed waitresses, known as &#x27;Nippies&#x27;; after the war the teashops converted to cafeteria service.

===Corner Houses===
Lyons&#x27; Corner Houses, which first appeared in 1909 and remained until 1977, were noted for their art deco style. Situated on or near the corners of Coventry Street, Strand and Tottenham Court Road, they and the Maisons Lyons at Marble Arch and in Shaftesbury Avenue were large buildings on four or five floors, the ground floor of which was a food hall with counters for delicatessen, sweets and chocolates, cakes, fruit, flowers and other products. In addition, they possessed hairdressing salons, telephone booths, theatre booking agencies and at one period a twice-a-day food delivery service. On the other floors were several restaurants, each with a different theme and all with their own musicians. For a time the Corner Houses were open 24 hours a day, and at their peak each branch employed around 400 staff. They featured window displays, and, in the post-war period, the Corner Houses were smarter and grander than the local tea shops. The artist Kay Lipton designed all the windows for the Corner Houses under the supervision of Norman Joseph, the director post-war. Between 1896 and 1965 Lyons owned the Trocadero, which was similar in size and style to the Corner Houses.

===Restaurants===
As well as the tea shops and Corner Houses, Lyons ran other large restaurants such as the Angel Cafe Restaurant in Islington and the Throgmorton in Throgmorton Street in the City of London. Its chains have included Steak Houses (1961–1988), Wimpy Bars (1953–1976), Baskin-Robbins (1974–present) and Dunkin&#x27; Donuts (1989–present).

===Hotels===
The Regent Palace Hotel, Glasshouse Street, London was operated by Strand Hotels Limited, a subsidiary of J. Lyons and Company and opened on 16 May 1915. Strand Hotels also operated the Cumberland Hotel (Marble Arch, London), Kingsley Hotel, Park Court Hotel, Windsor Hotel, White&#x27;s Hotel and the Strand Palace Hotel after the inception of Strand Hotels Limited. The last London hotel that they operated until the demise of the group in the mid-1970s was the Tower Hotel situated by Tower Bridge in London.

===Biscuits company===
In 1938, Lyons purchased the Bee Bee Biscuit Company, which manufactured biscuits from its factories in Blackpool. Six years later, Lyons changed the company&#x27;s name to Symbol Biscuits Ltd. and began selling biscuits under the Symbol and Lyons brand names: one of their innovations was Maryland Cookies in 1956. In 1990, Lyons changed the Symbol Biscuits name to Lyons Biscuits Ltd.

==Other activities==
===Supporting the war effort===

The rearmament period just before World War II saw a big expansion in the number of Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs), which were British government-owned. However, due to shortages of management resources some ROFs were run as agency factories; and J. Lyons and Co. ran at least one, ROF Elstow. The management and stock control systems needed in the ROFs, in respect of control of raw materials and &quot;perishable&quot; finished products, were somewhat similar to those used in the catering business; and J. Lyons was ideally suited to this task. They do not appear to have any involvement in managing these after 1945, when the ROFs started to run down.

===Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten&#x27;s wedding cake===
Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten were offered many cakes from well-wishers around the world for their wedding on 20 November 1947. Of these they accepted only 12, including one from J. Lyons and Co.

They created a three-tiered cake, mounted on a silver stand, made by F E Jacobs, chief decorator of J Lyons&#x27; Ornamental Department. It stood 1.8 metres high and weighed 63 kg. The first and second tiers featured specially commissioned 10 cm blue and white Wedgwood Jasper vases set in alcoves behind silver pillars, with smaller vases on the third tier. The cake&#x27;s panels depicted Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s coat of arms, the couple&#x27;s initials and a Naval crown. Atop the third tier sat a larger Jasper vase, filled with fresh flowers and trailing orange blossom.

===Contribution to computing in business===
The top management of Lyons, with its background in the use of mechanical adding machines, saw the necessity of new electrical computers for organising the distribution of cakes and other highly perishable goods. They, therefore, substantially financed the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) which was the second electronic digital stored-program computer to go into regular service, and built their own programmable digital computers. They became the first user of these in businesses, with the LEO I digital computer: the &quot;Lyons Electronic Office I&quot;, designed and built by Dr John Pinkerton under the leadership of John Simmons. It handled the company&#x27;s accounts and logistics. Lyons also included the weather forecast to ensure goods carried by their &quot;fresh produce&quot; delivery vans were not wasted in large quantities. Google chairman Eric Schmidt called this &quot;the world&#x27;s first office computer&quot;, built in 1951. A subsidiary LEO Computers Ltd was formed in 1954 and went on to build 11 Leo II and 94 Leo III computers that were sold worldwide.
One of the ardent users of LEO computers was the General Post Office (GPO), who bought them in the mid/late 1960s to produce telephone bills. They were kept going until 1981, helped by buying other companies&#x27; redundant machines and using them for spare parts.

==Decline==

The company was losing money in the 1960s but remained under the control of the Salmon family, descended from a founding partner. Lyons began to close some of its London tea shops and hotels; in 1963 it also merged its LEO Computers business with English Electric&#x27;s computer interests to form the jointly owned English Electric LEO.

In 1964, Lyons sold their half-stake; and English Electric merged the company with Marconi&#x27;s computer interests to form English Electric LEO Marconi Computers. A continuing problem in the British computer industry was both lack of investment capital and competition with the much larger U.S. computer companies, such as IBM. English Electric LEO Marconi Computers merged with other companies to form International Computers Limited (ICL) which was bought by Fujitsu in 1990.

In 1978, Lyons was acquired by Allied Breweries and became part of the resulting Allied Lyons. It fell on hard economic times in the late 1980s; and was sold, eventually being broken up with its ice cream and ice lolly products, which were branded as Lyons Maid, being sold to Nestlé. Other parts that were sold off included Lyons Cakes (sold to RHM and ending up as part of their Manor Bakeries subsidiary which also makes Mr Kipling&#x27;s Cakes) and Ready Brek cereal (ending up being owned by Weetabix Limited). At the end of 1994, Lyons sold Lyons Biscuits to Hillsdown Holdings, which later sold it to a U.S. investment firm which subsequently sold it to British biscuit manufacturer Burton&#x27;s Foods. Lyons&#x27; cake products, such as Bakewell tart and Battenberg, are owned by Premier Foods.

The J. Lyons &amp; Co. papers are now stored in the London Metropolitan Archives. The niece and nephew of the Gluckstein brothers were Gluck, a painter; and Louis Gluckstein, a Conservative politician. A descendant of the Salmon side of the original partnership is Nigella Lawson.

==Notable employees==
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked as a chemist for the company prior to becoming a barrister and then a Conservative Party MP. While working for the company she helped develop methods for preserving ice cream.

Peter Bird began work operating the LEO computer and rose to be a director of Lyons Computer Services. He later wrote a history of the company and its computers.

<text>James Marcellus Arthur &quot;Sunny&quot; Murray (September 21, 1936 – December 7, 2017) was an American musician, and was one of the pioneers of the free jazz style of drumming.

== Biography ==
Murray was born in Idabel, Oklahoma, where he was raised by an uncle who later died after being refused treatment at a hospital because of his race. He began playing drums at the age of nine. As a teen, he lived in a rough part of Philadelphia, and spent two years in a reformatory. In 1956, he moved to New York City, where he worked in a car wash and as a building superintendent. During this time, he played with musicians such as trumpeters Red Allen and Ted Curson, pianist Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, and saxophonists Rocky Boyd and Jackie McLean.

In 1959, he played for the first time with pianist Cecil Taylor and, according to Murray, &quot;[f]or six years all the other things were wiped from my mind...&quot; &quot;With Cecil, I had to originate a complete new direction on drums.&quot; Murray stated: &quot;We played for about a year, just practicing, studying — we went to workshops with Varèse, did a lot of creative things, just experimenting, without a job.&quot; In 1961, Murray made a recording with Taylor&#x27;s group that was released under the auspices of Gil Evans as one side of &quot;Into the Hot&quot;.

In 1962, Murray went to Europe for the first time with Taylor and saxophonist Jimmy Lyons. (Bassist Henry Grimes was supposed to join them, but fell ill at the last moment.) During that time, the group made a stylistic breakthrough; Murray stated: &quot;We were in Sweden and we had finally decided to be free... The way Cecil and Jimmy and I were playing, we could absorb any different thing at that period, because we were so fresh!&quot; While in Denmark later that year, the trio recorded the influential concerts released as &quot;Nefertiti the Beautiful One Has Come&quot;.

That same year, while in Sweden with Taylor, Murray met saxophonist Albert Ayler. (According to Murray, after hearing Taylor&#x27;s group perform, Ayler approached them and said &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting for you, man. &quot;You&#x27;re&quot; the guys I&#x27;ve been waiting for.&quot; He also recalled that Taylor &quot;jumped half out of his chair&quot; the first time Ayler played with the group.) With Ayler, the group recorded together for Danish television as the Cecil Taylor Unit (the track &quot;Four,&quot; featured on the Ayler box set &quot;Holy Ghost&quot;, was recorded during this time), and, upon returning to the United States, the group (with Ayler) performed at the Take Three club in Greenwich Village and at Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center in New York City on December 31, 1963, as the Cecil Taylor Jazz Unit, with Grimes back on bass. (The concert also featured Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers and the John Coltrane Quintet featuring Eric Dolphy.) Murray stated that Ayler &quot;didn&#x27;t know New York from a can of beans. So, he came over to my house, and I took him to meet Archie (Shepp) and all the cats.&quot; Murray continued to play with Ayler, and went on to join Ayler&#x27;s trio with bassist Gary Peacock. Murray recorded a number of albums with Ayler, including the historic &quot;Spiritual Unity&quot;. Val Wilmer wrote that Murray was &quot;one of those crucial figures in jazz who appear just at the time they are needed. His unchained approach to percussion gave Ayler the freedom to travel his own road that had hitherto been lacking.&quot; Murray also stated that he played with John Coltrane in 1964, and was offered a spot in Coltrane&#x27;s band, but turned it down.

Murray went on to record his own compositions under his own name, beginning in 1965 with &quot;Sonny&#x27;s Time Now,&quot; which was released on Leroi Jones&#x27;s Jihad label. The album features Ayler, Don Cherry, Henry Grimes, and Lewis Worrell, as well as Jones, who recites his poem &quot;Black Art&quot;. (Murray stated &quot;It’s a strange record because Albert and Don [Cherry] are playing like this [makes screeching sound].&quot;) Later, when he moved to Europe, he released three recordings on BYG Actuel. In addition, he continued to play and record as a sideman for a variety of musicians. In 1980, he reunited with Cecil Taylor for the recording of &quot;It Is in the Brewing Luminous&quot;, and in 1996, he recorded with Taylor again, resulting in the album &quot;Corona&quot;, released in 2018. He died on December 7, 2017, from multiple organ failure at the age of 81.

A documentary on Murray, entitled &quot;Sunny&#x27;s Time Now: A Portrait of Jazz Drummer Sunny Murray&quot;, was released on DVD in 2008 by director Antoine Prum.

== Style ==

Murray was among the first to forgo the drummer&#x27;s traditional role as timekeeper in favor of purely textural playing. Val Wilmer wrote:
Murray&#x27;s aim was to free the soloist completely from the restrictions of time, and to do this he set up a continual hailstorm of percussion. His concept relied heavily on continuous ringing stick-work on the edge of the cymbals, an irregular staccato barrage on the snare, spasmodic bass drum punctuation and constant, but not metronomic, use of the sock-cymbal (hi-hat). He played with his mouth open, emitting an incessant wailing which blended into the overall percussion backdrop of shifting pulses... [H]is playing often seems to bear little relation to what the soloist is doing. What he did do, though, was to lay down a shimmering tapestry behind the soloist, enabling him to move wherever he wanted.&quot;
Concerning Murray&#x27;s tenure with Albert Ayler, John Litweiler wrote: &quot;Sunny Murray and Albert Ayler did not merely break through bar lines, they abolished them altogether.&quot; Amiri Baraka described Murray&#x27;s playing as follows:
Watching Sonny play, as he swoops and floats, hovers, lunges, above and into the drums, it is immediate... his body-ness, his physicality in the music. Not just as a drum beater but as a conductor of energies, directing them this way and that way. Just scraping a cymbal this time, smashing it the next. Both feet straight out with the bass drums. His rolls and bombs the result of body-mined spirit feel. He wants &quot;natural sounds,&quot; natural rhythms. The drum as a reactor and manifestor of energies coursing through and pouring out of his body. Rhythm as occurrence. As natural emphasis...
You hear him moaning behind his instrument, with his other beautiful instrument. His voice. The sound of feeling. The moan, a ragged body-spasm sound, like some kind of heavy stringed instrument, lifting all the other sounds into prayers.
Author Norman C. Weinstein wrote:

[Murray] radically rethinks the role of the drum kit, sees the kit as a kinetic sculpture... The drums are a sculpture he dances around, giving the drum kit a numinosity like African drums utilized for ritual purposes. By dancing about the drums, not merely alertly sitting before them, he maximizes the force of his contact with all surfaces, not just skins but metal and wood as well. The sheer physicality of his approach assures a broader spectrum of timbres than those usually achieved by players utilizing conventional posture. Murray&#x27;s dance in fast motion... creates the illusion of several drummers performing simultaneously, a stuttering strobe effect akin to how Duchamp caused his nude to trip the light fantastic down a staircase... The richness of Murray&#x27;s cymbal crashes and vocals is beautifully reinforced by his drum attacks, particularly his sonorous tattoos on the bass drum. He has an astute gift for playing off extreme tonal contrasts, high-pitched cymbals ringing in counterpoint to earth-moaning bass drum tones... He... creates a sense of time which might be appreciated by a tradition-minded African, not time measured by Timex, not shaped by a cymbal&#x27;s metronomic insistences, but time as the poet Blake understood it, found in the pulsation of an artery.
Murray acknowledged the influence of Hermann Helmholtz in developing his unique approach to the drum kit, stating that &quot;Helmholtz gave me the technique I needed.&quot; Referring to Murray&#x27;s rapid fluttering of the bass drum and washes and waves of cymbal noise, bassist Alan Silva stated &quot;...it was the end of swing as we know it. It became so fast it became slow. Sunny Murray is the first drummer who ever played the theory of relativity.&quot; Murray described his own musical goals as follows: &quot;I work for natural sounds rather than trying to sound like drums. Sometimes I try to sound like car motors or the continuous crackling of glass... not just the sound of drums but the sound of the crashing of cars and the upheaval of a volcano and the thunder of the skies.&quot; At one point he attempted to design a different kind of drum set that would be &quot;more in touch with the human voice in terms of humming and screaming and laughing and crying.&quot;

<doc id="511591" wikidata="Q2166304" url="?curid=511591" title="Manchester city centre">
<text>Manchester City Centre is the central business district of Manchester, in Greater Manchester, England, within the confines of Great Ancoats Street, A6042 Trinity Way, and A57(M) Mancunian Way, which collectively form an inner ring road. The City Centre ward had a population of 17,861 at the 2011 census.

Manchester city centre evolved from the civilian &quot;vicus&quot; of the Roman fort of Mamucium, on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell. This became the township of Manchester during the Middle Ages, and was the site of the Peterloo Massacre of 1819. Manchester was granted city status in 1853, after the Industrial Revolution, from which the city centre emerged as the global centre of the cotton trade which encouraged its &quot;splendidly imposing commercial architecture&quot; during the Victorian era, such as the Royal Exchange, the Corn Exchange, the Free Trade Hall, and the Great Northern Warehouse. After the decline of the cotton trade and the Manchester Blitz, the city centre suffered economic decline during the mid-20th century, but the CIS Tower ranked as the tallest building in the UK when completed in 1962.

The city centre acts as the transport interchange for Greater Manchester and over 7 million people live within an hour&#x27;s drive of it. The 1996 Manchester bombing provided the impetus for the redevelopment of the city centre and an upturn in retail, leisure, offices and urban living. The economy of the city centre is built primarily on retail and services, accounting for nearly 40% of Grade-A city centre office space outside London.

==History==
Manchester evolved from the civilian &quot;vicus&quot; associated with the Roman fort of Mamucium, which was established c. AD 79 on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell, in a position defensible from the Brigantes. Once the Romans had abandoned Britain, the focus of settlement shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and Irk. During the Dark Ages which followed – and persisted until the Norman Conquest – the settlement was in the territory of several different petty kingdoms. In the Middle Ages, what is now the city centre was the township of Manchester.

Manchester Castle – a medieval fortification, probably taking the form of a ringwork – was located on a bluff where the rivers Irk and Irwell meet. The castle was first mentioned in 1184 and recorded in 1215 as belonging to the barons of Manchester, the Grelley family. It has been described as &quot;of no political or military importance&quot;. The Grelleys replaced the castle with a fortified manor house, which in turn was replaced by a college of priests (founded in 1421). In 1547 the college was dissolved and the property acquired by the Earl of Derby and early in the reign of King Charles II it was sold to the governors who had been appointed in the will of Humphrey Chetham. By royal charter in 1665 Chetham&#x27;s Hospital was established and this became Chetham&#x27;s School of Music.

==Governance==

Manchester city centre is part of the Manchester Central constituency, represented by Labour Co-op MP Lucy Powell.

The City Centre ward was divided in 2018 between two new wards, Deansgate and Piccadilly.

==Geography==

The city centre has variously been defined as those parts of the city within the Manchester Inner Ring Road, or else the entire area within Manchester&#x27;s Inner Ring Road, thereby encompassing a part of the administratively separate City of Salford, and an area of Oxford Road to the south. Political and economic ties between the city centre and neighbouring Salford and Trafford have strengthened with the shift from town and district centres to metropolitan-level centres in England. Manchester city centre is the commercial heart of Greater Manchester and with adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford is defined as its Regional Centre for urban planning and public transport purposes.
There is little order due to the manner in which the city rapidly developed during the Industrial Revolution nor much agreement on the differing areas in Manchester city centre. However many areas and streets in the city centre have a distinctive character with identifiable clusters of industrial warehouses, civic buildings and modern developments. Many of these distinctive areas are covered in 14 city centre conservation areas which are defined by Manchester City Council.

===Castlefield===
Castlefield is an area in the extreme southwest between Deansgate and the River Irwell with the sites of the Roman fort and Liverpool Road Railway Station. It retains much of its industrial character and is the only Urban Heritage Park in the United Kingdom, and is marked by its mercantile 19th warehouses and adjoining wharfs which were used to transport goods from Manchester during the Manchester&#x27;s industrial era. Today, Castlefield is quiet and noted for its waterside bars and pubs. Notable structures include Manchester Liverpool Road station which was the first inter-city railway station on the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830. Today the station frontage remains and is Grade I listed, as is the adjoining 1830s warehouse. The structure now forms part of the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI). For many years Castlefield was on a tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Status for its industrial past – particularly in regards to the development of the canal as a mode of transportation and the railway.

===Northern Quarter===

The Northern Quarter is in the north east and is known as a hub for alternate and bohemian culture in Manchester. Previously the area was the retail heart of the city centre but with the opening of the Manchester Arndale in the 1970s patronage gradually dwindled and vacant buildings were commonplace. In the late 1980s the area was renamed as the Northern Quarter in the hope that the area would be reincarnated from the ground up. Following the boom of the late 90s and early 2000s the area has become a popular destination for shops, bars, restaurants and nightclub – many of which have an independent ethos.

===Central Retail District===

The opening of the Manchester Arndale in 1975 shifted the retail focus towards the area bounded by Market Street, Corporation Street, Withy Grove and High Street. Despite the Arndale&#x27;s unpopularity with many critics, it has been described as an outstandingly successful shopping centre by visitor numbers and spending. Today the Arndale attracts 41 million visitors a year and is the largest city centre shopping centre in the United Kingdom.

The area has been extensively redeveloped after the IRA bomb of 1996 and contains Manchester Cathedral, Shambles Square, Exchange Square and Cathedral Gardens, as well as shopping streets Market Street and King Street. Since the bomb, Selfridges, Marks &amp; Spencer and NEXT have opened dedicated large stores in the area. Not all shops are strictly in the retail area with many in Deansgate and King Street – a short walk from the area.

===Spinningfields===

Spinningfields is an area in the west adjoining the middle part of Deansgate and the main business district of the city centre. The proposal to create a designated central business district originated in 1997 when Allied London purchased a number of buildings around the John Rylands Library. Allied London executive Mike Ingall was convinced of the site&#x27;s regeneration potential and Manchester City Council was keen to redevelop the city centre after the 1996 Manchester bombing. The development, named from a narrow street which ran westwards from Deansgate, is bounded by Bridge Street to the north, Quay Street to the south, Deansgate to the east, and the River Irwell to the west.

The area is noted for glazed, modern buildings – many of which are offices. In 2010, Spinningfields accounted for 35% of the city centre prime office space with 44 commercial organisation employing nearly 20,000 people. Notable buildings in the area include 1 The Avenue, 3 Hardman Street and the Civil Justice Centre – short-listed for the Stirling Prize and noted as a landmark building for its distinctive cantilevers. Future buildings include the Cotton Building and construction commenced in summer 2014 and will be completed by 2016. Construction on a new 90 metre office tower, 1 Spinningfields could also commence in 2015 after securing a pre-let in late 2014.

Aside from offices, Spinningfields was home to a number of high end retail units such as Armani and Mulberry. However, with the main retail district being on the opposite side of the city centre, these units struggled. In recent years the district has cultivated a far more successful image in the food and drink offering with a number of popular restaurants and bars in the area. Footfall, particularly in the evening after work hours, has increased, and revenue from retail and leisure in Spinningfields has risen from £10 million in 2008 to £50 million in 2014.

===Piccadilly===
Piccadilly is the transport interchange of the city centre with rail, tram and bus services all within a five-minute walk. The area is typically busy with pedestrians commuting to and from the city centre. The area is dominated by Piccadilly Gardens. It is the largest public square in the centre which was redeveloped in the early 2000s but not to a universally positive reception. For over 150 years Manchester Royal Infirmary was located on the site but closed in 1914. A few years after closure the hospital was demolished and public space was created with a landscaped garden set into the ground – hence the name. The area has a dedicated tram station and bus station which has over 20 stands. Most of the stands are located on the south-west side of the square with the rest on the north side.

===Peter&#x27;s Fields (Civic Quarter)===


Peter&#x27;s Fields, now known as St Peter&#x27;s Square sits at the top of Oxford Road and Peter Street and extends east towards Princess Street. It is noted for its purpose as a civic area and includes important buildings and monuments such as Central Library, Midland Hotel, YMCA Building, Manchester Town Hall and Town Hall Extension – all of which are listed. It is described by Manchester City Council as &quot;perhaps the greatest collective accolade to Manchester&#x27;s original modern heritage&quot;. The Square is famous for the Peterloo Massacre in 1819 when cavalry charged into a crowd of 60,000–80,000 that had gathered to demand the reform of parliamentary representation on what was previously fields – hence the name Peter&#x27;s Fields. A monument to commemorate the nationally importantly event in the struggle for suffrage is expected to be commissioned for 2019 to mark the 200th anniversary of the massacre. In recent years, the square has been redeveloped with new high-rise office buildings, One St Peter&#x27;s Square and Two St Peter&#x27;s Square with further buildings approved for the derelict Odeon site and London Scottish House adjacent to the Midland Hotel. As part of the redevelopment, the Cenotaph was relocated outside Manchester Town Hall in 2014 and St Peter&#x27;s Square tram stop was redeveloped with an additional platform and new configuration in 2016.

===Chinatown===

Chinatown is an area to the south of Piccadilly Gardens with many oriental restaurants and other facilities of a far eastern character. It is the second largest Chinatown in the United Kingdom and the third largest in Europe. The first settlers to arrive in the city came in the early 20th century; according to the BBC, &quot;Many arrived alone and were engaged in what was seen as the traditional trade of laundries.&quot; Manchester&#x27;s first Chinese restaurant, Ping Hong, opened on Mosley Street in 1948, on the eve of a Chinese immigration wave that would commence during the 1950s. Manchester did not have a significant Chinese population, reaching only about 2,000. However, after World War II, there were severe labour shortages, and in response, the government passed the British Nationality Act 1948, which allowed easier access into the country. Additionally, Hong Kong&#x27;s rapid urbanisation meant that many farmers and traditional residents&#x27; homes were being destroyed by the urban sprawl, so many decided to migrate. The area&#x27;s beginnings are rooted in the restaurant business, as many Chinese restaurants surfaced soon after the immigration boom. By the 1970s other Chinese businesses began to emerge, such as medicine shops, Chinese supermarkets, as well as financial and legal services, all serving the employees of the expanding number of Chinese restaurants in the area. The area has retained a far eastern character ever since and in 1987 a paifang archway was installed to as a gift to the Chinese community and to reflect the far eastern heritage of the area.

===Canal Street===

Canal Street, known as the Gay Village, is a part of the centre east of Portland Street and west of Whitworth Street through which runs the Rochdale Canal; it contains many bars, clubs and other facilities – many of which are focused towards the LGBT community. The area has long been associated with the gay community with links going back to the early 20th century when homosexuality was still illegal. During the industrial years the area was a red light district.


==Demography==
At the 2001 UK census, the political ward of &quot;Central&quot;, which covers an area of , had a population of 11,689 with a population density of . While this was lower than the population density for the whole city (), the proportion of land dedicated to domestic buildings was lower in the ward than in the whole city (6.7% compared to 8.0%). There was a female-to-male ratio of 100 to 113, much higher than the 100 to 95 ratio for all England. Of those over 16 years old, 65.7% were single (never married), 13.7% married, and 8.7% divorced; this was significantly different from the national figures of 30.2% single, 43.5% married, and 8.2% divorced. The ward&#x27;s 6,188 households included 61.1% one-person, 8.6% married couples living together, 9.0% were co-habiting couples, and 12.4% single parents with their children; compared to national figures, there was a high proportion of single person households, and a low proportion of married couples living together. Of those aged 16–74, 30.5% had no academic qualifications, lower than the figure for the City of Manchester (34.0%) but slightly above that of the whole of England (28.9%). The ward had a significantly higher percentage of adults with a diploma or degree than the city or England as a whole. Of the ward&#x27;s residents aged 16–74, 26.3% had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, qualified nurse, midwife, or health visitor, compared to 21.4% in Manchester and 19.9% nationwide.

==Economy==
Deansgate and Market Street are the centre&#x27;s principal retail streets and King Street (with high-class shops) and St Ann&#x27;s Square are known for their specialist fashion and other shops. There is also a large indoor shopping mall called the Manchester Arndale Centre. Manchester city centre has several large department stores including Marks and Spencer on Market Street, House of Fraser on Deansgate, Harvey Nichols on New Cathedral Street and Selfridges in Exchange Square. There are many leisure facilities in the city centre including the Printworks, a large facility containing a cinema (including an IMAX screen), numerous bars, clubs and restaurants and also Manchester&#x27;s first Hard Rock Cafe. The Northern Quarter, centred on Oldham Street, is known for its Bohemian atmosphere and independent shops and cafes.
The landscaping of the city centre has provided several public spaces including Piccadilly Gardens, which incorporates fountains, green spaces, a concrete pavilion designed by Tadao Ando, and a Metrolink station. Exchange Square is located near Urbis, formerly an exhibition centre focusing on city life but closed and re-opened in mid-2011 as the National Football Museum. Both Piccadilly and Exchange Square are used for screening public events. Two of the city centre&#x27;s oldest buildings, &quot;The Old Wellington Inn&quot; and &quot;Sinclair&#x27;s Oyster Bar&quot;, were dismantled, moved 300 yards and re-erected in 1999 to create the new Shambles Square adjacent to Manchester Cathedral.

There are a great variety of restaurants in the city centre. There are also a good stock of hotels in the city centre which include the Midland, the Hilton within the Beetham Tower, and Kimpton Clocktower.

===Leisure===

Manchester city centre has many nightclubs, many of which follow in the footsteps of the Haçienda nightclub which has now closed; the site has been redeveloped as a housing complex. There is a gay village around the Canal Street area in the east of the city centre, which plays host to an annual Gay Pride Festival, and a large Chinatown with numerous far eastern style restaurants. The area to the west which is bisected by Deansgate and crossed by Peter Street is also well-provided with bars and some clubs (e.g. The Moon under Water and Ampersand). Rafters was a nightclub located in St James&#x27;s Buildings. A number of bands played concerts at Rafters in the 1970s and 1980s. Rafters closed in 1983. In its final years the DJ was Mike Shaft who appeared on Piccadilly Radio with Takin&#x27; Care of Business. After that the club was renamed as Jilly&#x27;s which existed to 1993, after which the club was called MusicBox. The city centre also has many bars, mostly located in the Northern Quarter, regarded by some as the central district&#x27;s creative hub. The quarter is well-provided with bars of various sizes; these include TV 21, Bar Fringe, the cocktail bar Apotheca and Trof. Live music venues may also be found here, including the Night &amp; Day Cafe, MOHO Live and jazz bar Matt &amp; Phred&#x27;s.

There are two major theatres in the city centre, the Palace Theatre (opened 1891) and the Manchester Opera House (opened 1912). In 2008, plans emerged to redevelop the Palace Theatre as a northern base for the Royal Opera and Royal Ballet however these plans were shelved and both theatres were purchased by the Ambassador Theatre Group for £90m. In recent years the Group have launched the &#x27;Manchester Gets It First&#x27; campaign and a number of high-profile musicals have premiered in Manchester such as &quot;Ghost&quot; in 2011. The Royal Exchange, a nationally known theatre company which specialising in new productions of the classics and is known for its &#x27;the round&#x27; layout. The Cornerhouse, at the top of Oxford Road and opposite the Palace, is a venue for the visual arts and contains several cinemas which show mainly art house films. A new Cornerhouse and Library Theatre building will open at First Street in 2015 providing a larger home for both companies.

Manchester Art Gallery, opened in 1824, welcomes over half a million visitors every year and is one of the largest galleries outside London. The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry in Castlefield explores the industrial heritage of the United Kingdom with emphasis on Manchester. The People&#x27;s History Museum explores the social history of Manchester and the United Kingdom. Many galleries and museum exist outside the city centre in Manchester and Greater Manchester such as the Whitworth Art Gallery, Imperial War Museum North and The Lowry.


==Transport==
===Rail===
Manchester City Centre has four railway stations in the Manchester station group: Piccadilly, Victoria, Oxford Road and Deansgate.
* Manchester Piccadilly station is the largest station in the City with 14 platforms plus 2 Metrolink tram platforms, located on the southeast side of the city centre not far from Piccadilly Gardens, the Gay Village, and the Northern Quarter. The main access is from Piccadilly, which continues towards Ardwick as London Road.
* Manchester Victoria station is the main terminus for services from the north and west of Greater Manchester and includes both rail and Metrolink platforms. Victoria is located in the northwest of the city centre near the northern end of Deansgate, Corporation Street and Exchange Square and is connected to the Manchester Arena. It underwent a £44m renovation, completed in August 2015.
* Manchester Oxford Road station serves the southern corridor of the city centre, where both the University of Manchester and Manchester Metropolitan University are located, as well as the Central Manchester Hospitals, Palace Theatre, and Cornerhouse.
* Deansgate station is located in the southwest, between Deansgate locks and nearby Castlefield at the southern end of Deansgate (which is over a mile long). It is also a short walk away from Beetham Tower, as well as the Great Northern complex, housing an AMC Cinema, bars and leisure attractions. It is connected via a link bridge to Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop.

===Metrolink===
Metrolink is the light rail tram service that operates in Central Manchester. The services are usually 6 mins in the peak and 12 mins off-peak to most destinations, all of which are within Greater Manchester. As of 2021 there are eight lines operating, connecting the city centre with termini at Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, East Didsbury, Eccles, Manchester Airport, MediaCityUK, Rochdale and the Trafford Centre. A new line through the city centre was recently constructed.

Metrolink stops in the city centre currently are:
* Deansgate-Castlefield – services to Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Eccles, East Didsbury, MediaCityUK and Rochdale, and a service to Manchester Airport
* Exchange Square – located in Exchange Square
* Market Street – located in one of the main shopping streets and close the Arndale Centre, serving passengers on the Altrincham, Bury, East Didsbury and Rochdale lines.
* Piccadilly – located beneath the main concourse, with services to Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Eccles and MediaCityUK as well as city centre stations/stops.
* Piccadilly Gardens – located in the busiest bus/tram interchange in the city centre with services to Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, Eccles and MediaCityUK as well as other city stations including Victoria and Piccadilly.
* Shudehill – an interchange station similar to Piccadilly Gardens located near the Northern Quarter, The Printworks and Shudehill bus station. Services to Altrincham, Bury, East Didsbury and Rochdale operate from this interchange.
* St Peter&#x27;s Square – it serves the Altrincham, Bury, Eccles, East Didsbury, Manchester Airport, MediaCityUK and Rochdale lines. It is located close to the central library, town hall and Oxford Street.
* Victoria – services to Altrincham, Bury, East Didsbury and Rochdale currently operate from this station, however once expansion of the network is complete it will see a new service to Manchester Airport.

Two stations used to serve the city centre but have been closed:
* High Street – closed in 1998, unidirectional platform closed after extension of Market Street stop.
* Mosley Street – closed in 2013, unidirectional.

====Second City Crossing (2CC)====
To facilitate the Metrolink expansion and increased tram frequency an alternative route through the city centre was required. The 2CC runs from Victoria station to St Peter&#x27;s Square via Exchange Square, Corporation Street, Cross Street and Princess Street. Utility works on re-routing gas and water supplies began in January 2014 and lasted for over a year. The works impacted heavily on parts of the city centre with streets and pavements closed off and awkward diversions introduced.

===Bus/Coach===
There are also 2 major bus interchanges located in the city centre; Manchester Piccadilly bus station and Shudehill Interchange which all serve local bus services to areas in the 10 Greater Manchester boroughs, as well as some from the surrounding counties of Cheshire, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Derbyshire.
* Piccadilly Gardens bus station provides services mainly to the south and east of Greater Manchester and parts of Cheshire. Most services are operated by Stagecoach Manchester.
* Shudehill Interchange provides services mainly to the north and west of Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire. Most services are operated by either Go North West or Diamond Bus.

Chorlton Street coach station provides long-distance coach services operated by National Express to cities across Great Britain.
Shudehill was opened so the bus system was directional.

<doc id="511596" wikidata="Q1935697" url="?curid=511596" title="Tiger (hash function)">
<text>In cryptography, Tiger is a cryptographic hash function designed by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham in 1995 for efficiency on 64-bit platforms. The size of a Tiger hash value is 192 bits. Truncated versions (known as Tiger/128 and Tiger/160) can be used for compatibility with protocols assuming a particular hash size. Unlike the SHA-2 family, no distinguishing initialization values are defined; they are simply prefixes of the full Tiger/192 hash value.

Tiger2 is a variant where the message is padded by first appending a byte with the hexadecimal value of 0x80 as in MD4, MD5 and SHA, rather than with the hexadecimal value of 0x01 as in the case of Tiger. The two variants are otherwise identical.

==Algorithm==
Tiger is based on Merkle–Damgård construction. The one-way compression function operates on 64-bit words, maintaining 3 words of state and processing 8 words of data. There are 24 rounds, using a combination of operation mixing with XOR and addition/subtraction, rotates, and S-box lookups, and a fairly intricate key scheduling algorithm for deriving 24 round keys from the 8 input words.

Although fast in software, Tiger&#x27;s large S-boxes (four S-boxes, each with 256 64-bit entries totaling 8 KiB) make implementations in hardware or microcontrollers difficult.

==Usage==
Tiger is frequently used in Merkle hash tree form, where it is referred to as TTH (Tiger Tree Hash). TTH is used by many clients on the Direct Connect and Gnutella file sharing networks, and can optionally be included in the BitTorrent metafile for better content availability.

Tiger was considered for inclusion in the OpenPGP standard, but was abandoned in favor of RIPEMD-160.

==OID==
 refers to TIGER as having no OID, whereas the GNU Coding Standards list TIGER as having OID codice_1. In the IPSEC subtree, HMAC-TIGER is assigned OID codice_2. No OID for TTH has been announced yet.

==Byte order==
The specification of Tiger does not define the way its output should be printed but only defines the result to be three ordered 64-bit integers. The &quot;testtiger&quot; program at the author&#x27;s homepage was intended to allow easy testing of the test source code, rather than to define any particular print order. The protocols Direct Connect and ADC as well as the program codice_3 use little-endian byte order, which is also preferred by one of the authors.

==Examples==
In the example below, the 192-bit (24-byte) Tiger hashes are represented as 48 hexadecimal digits in little-endian byte order. The following demonstrates a 43-byte ASCII input and the corresponding Tiger hashes:

 Tiger(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 6d12a41e72e644f017b6f0e2f7b44c6285f06dd5d2c5b075
 Tiger2(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 976abff8062a2e9dcea3a1ace966ed9c19cb85558b4976d8

Even a small change in the message will (with very high probability) result in a completely different hash, e.g. changing to : 

 Tiger(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 a8f04b0f7201a0d728101c9d26525b31764a3493fcd8458f
 Tiger2(&quot;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy og&quot;) =
 09c11330283a27efb51930aa7dc1ec624ff738a8d9bdd3df

The hash of the zero-length string is:

 Tiger(&quot;) =
 3293ac630c13f0245f92bbb1766e16167a4e58492dde73f3
 Tiger2(&quot;) =
 4441be75f6018773c206c22745374b924aa8313fef919f41

==Cryptanalysis==
Unlike MD5 or SHA-0/1, there are no known effective attacks on the full 24-round Tiger except for pseudo-near collision. While MD5 processes its state with 64 simple 32-bit operations per 512-bit block and SHA-1 with 80, Tiger updates its state with a total of 144 such operations per 512-bit block, additionally strengthened by large S-box look-ups.

John Kelsey and Stefan Lucks have found a collision-finding attack on 16-round Tiger with a time complexity equivalent to about 244 compression function invocations and another attack that finds pseudo-near collisions in 20-round Tiger with work less than that of 248 compression function invocations. Florian Mendel et al. have improved upon these attacks by describing a collision attack spanning 19 rounds of Tiger, and a 22-round pseudo-near-collision attack. These attacks require a work effort equivalent to about 262 and 244 evaluations of the Tiger compression function, respectively.

<text>The Shanghainese language, also known as the Shanghai dialect, or Hu language, is a variety of Wu Chinese spoken in the central districts of the city of Shanghai and its surrounding areas. It is classified as part of the Sino-Tibetan language family. Shanghainese, like the rest of the Wu language group, is mutually unintelligible with other varieties of Chinese, such as Mandarin.

Shanghainese belongs to a separate group of the Taihu Wu subgroup. With nearly 14 million speakers, Shanghainese is also the largest single form of Wu Chinese. Since the late 19th century, it has served as the lingua franca of the entire Yangtze River Delta region, but in recent decades its status has declined relative to Mandarin, which most Shanghainese speakers can also speak.

Like other Wu varieties, Shanghainese is rich in vowels and consonants, with around twenty unique vowel qualities, twelve of which are phonemic. Similarly, Shanghainese also has voiced obstruent initials, which is rare outside of Wu and Xiang varieties. Shanghainese also has a low number of tones compared to other languages in Southern China and has a system of tone sandhi similar to Japanese pitch accent.

== History ==

The speech of Shanghai had long been influenced by those spoken around Jiaxing, then Suzhou during the Qing dynasty. Suzhounese literature, Chuanqi, Tanci, and folk songs all influenced early Shanghainese.

During the 1850s, the port of Shanghai was opened, and a large number of migrants entered the city. This led to many loanwords from both the West and the East, especially from Ningbonese, and like Cantonese in Hong Kong, English. In fact, &quot;speakers of other Wu dialects traditionally treat the Shanghai vernacular somewhat contemptuously as a mixture of Suzhou and Ningbo dialects.&quot; This has led to Shanghainese becoming one of the fastest-developing languages of the Wu Chinese subgroup, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. It underwent sustained growth that reached a peak in the 1930s during the Republican era, when migrants arrived in Shanghai and immersed themselves in the local tongue. Migrants from Shanghai also brought Shanghainese to many overseas Chinese communities. As of 2016, 83,400 people in Hong Kong are still able to speak Shanghainese. Shanghainese is sometimes viewed as a tool to discriminate against immigrants. Migrants who move from other Chinese cities to Shanghai have little ability to speak Shanghainese. Among the migrant people, some believe Shanghainese represents the superiority of native Shanghainese people. Some also believe that native residents intentionally speak Shanghainese in some places to discriminate against the immigrant population to transfer their anger to migrant workers, who take over their homeland and take advantage of housing, education, medical, and job resources.

After the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s government imposed and promoted Standard Chinese as the official language of all of China, Shanghainese had started its decline. During the Chinese economic reform of 1978, Shanghainese has once again took in a large number of migrants. Due to the prominence of Standard Mandarin, learning Shanghainese was no longer necessary for migrants. However, Shanghainese remained a vital part of the city&#x27;s culture and retained its prestige status within the local population. In the 1990s, it was still common for local radio and television broadcasts to be in Shanghainese. For example, in 1995, the TV series &quot;Sinful Debt&quot; featured extensive Shanghainese dialogue; when it was broadcast outside Shanghai (mainly in adjacent Wu-speaking areas) Mandarin subtitles were added. The Shanghainese TV series &quot;Lao Niang Jiu&quot; (, &quot;Old Uncle&quot;) was broadcast from 1995 to 2007; it was popular among Shanghainese residents. Shanghainese programming has since slowly declined amid regionalist-localist accusations. From 1992 onward, Shanghainese use was discouraged in schools, and many children native to Shanghai can no longer speak Shanghainese. In addition, Shanghai&#x27;s emergence as a cosmopolitan global city consolidated the status of Mandarin as the standard language of business and services, at the expense of the local language.

Since 2005, movements have emerged to protect Shanghainese. At municipal legislative discussions in 2005, former Shanghai opera actress Ma Lili moved to &quot;protect&quot; the language, stating that she was one of the few remaining Shanghai opera actresses who still retained authentic classic Shanghainese pronunciation in their performances. Shanghai&#x27;s former party boss Chen Liangyu, a native Shanghainese himself, reportedly supported her proposal. Shanghainese has been reintegrated into pre-kindergarten education, with education of native folk songs and rhymes, as well as a Shanghainese-only day on Fridays in the &quot;Modern Baby Kindergarten&quot;. Professor Qian Nairong, linguist and head of the Chinese Department at Shanghai University, is working on efforts to save the language. In response to criticism, Qian reminds people that Shanghainese was once fashionable, saying, &quot;the popularization of Mandarin doesn&#x27;t equal the ban of dialects. It doesn&#x27;t make Mandarin a more civilized language either. Promoting dialects is not a narrow-minded localism, as it has been labeled by some netizens&quot;. Qian has also urged for Shanghainese to be taught in other sectors of education, due to kindergarten and university courses being insufficient.

During the 2010s, many achievements have been made to preserve Shanghainese. In 2011, Hu Baotan wrote &quot;Longtang&quot; (, &quot;Longtang&quot;), the first ever Shanghainese novel. In June 2012, a new television program airing in Shanghainese was created. In 2013, buses in Shanghai started using Shanghainese broadcasts. In 2017, Apple&#x27;s iOS 11 introduced Siri in Shanghainese, being only the third Sinitic language to be supported, after Standard Mandarin and Cantonese. In 2018, the Japanese-Chinese animated anthology drama film &quot;Flavors of Youth&quot; had a section set in Shanghai, with significant Shanghainese dialogue. In January 2019, singer Lin Bao released the first Shanghainese pop record &quot;Shanghai Yao&quot; (, &quot;Shanghai Ballad&quot;). In December 2021, the Shanghainese-language romantic comedy movie &quot;Myth of Love&quot; () was released. Its box office revenue was ¥260 million, and response was generally positive. Similarly, in December 2023, the TV show &quot;Blossoms Shanghai&quot; () aired with the primary language being Shanghainese.

Today, around half the population of Shanghai can converse in Shanghainese, and a further quarter can understand it. Though the number of speakers has been declining, a large number of people want to preserve it.

== Status ==
Due to the large number of ethnic groups of China, efforts to establish a common language have been attempted many times. Therefore, the language issue has always been an important part of Beijing&#x27;s rule. Other than the government language-management efforts, the rate of rural-to-urban migration in China has also accelerated the shift to Standard Chinese and the disappearance of native languages and dialects in the urban areas.

As more people moved into Shanghai, the economic center of China, Shanghainese has been threatened despite it originally being a strong topolect of Wu Chinese. According to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, the population of Shanghai was estimated to be 24.28 million in 2019, of whom 14.5 million are permanent residents and 9.77 million are migrant residents. To have better communication with foreign residents and develop a top-level financial center among the world, the promotion of the official language, Standard Mandarin, became very important. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Government banned the use of Shanghainese in public places, schools, and work. Around half of the city&#x27;s population is unaware of these policies.

A survey of students from the primary school in 2010 indicated that 52.3% of students believed Mandarin is easier than Shanghainese for communication, and 47.6% of the students choose to speak Mandarin because it is a mandatory language at school. Furthermore, 68.3% of the students are more willing to study Mandarin, but only 10.2% of the students are more willing to study Shanghainese. A survey in 2021 has shown that 15.22% of respondents under 18 would never use Shanghainese. The study also found that the percentage of people that would use Shanghainese with older family members has halved. The study also shows that around one third of people under the age of 30 can only understand Shanghainese, and 8.7% of respondents under 18 cannot even understand it. The number of people that are able to speak Shanghainese has also consistently decreased.

Much of the youth can no longer speak Shanghainese fluently because they had no chance to practice it at school. Also, they were unwilling to communicate with their parents in Shanghainese, which has accelerated its decline. The survey in 2010 indicated that 62.6% of primary school students use Mandarin as the first language at home, but only 17.3% of them use Shanghainese to communicate with their parents.

However, the same study from 2021 has shown that more than 90% of all age groups except 18–29 want to preserve Shanghainese. A total of 87.06% of people have noted that the culture of Shanghai cannot live without its language as it is used as a mechanism to bring people together and create a sense of community and warmth. Moreover, around half of the respondents stated that a Shanghainese citizen should be able to speak Shanghainese. More than 85% of all participants also believe that they help Shanghainese revitalization.

== Classification ==
Shanghainese macroscopically is spoken in Shanghai and parts of eastern Nantong, and constitutes the Shanghai subranch of the Northern Wu family of Wu Chinese. Some linguists group Shanghainese with nearby varieties, such as Huzhounese and Suzhounese, which has about 73% lexical similarity with Standard Mandarin, into a branch known as Suhujia (), due to them sharing many phonological, lexical, and grammatical similarities. Newer varieties of Shanghainese, however, have been influenced by standard Chinese as well as Cantonese and other varieties, making the Shanghainese idiolects spoken by young people in the city different from that spoken by the older population. Also, the practice of inserting Mandarin into Shanghainese conversations is very common, at least for young people. Like most subdivisions of Chinese, it is easier for a local speaker to understand Mandarin than it is for a Mandarin speaker to understand the local language. It is also of note that Shanghainese, like other Northern Wu languages, is not mutually intelligible with Southern Wu languages like Taizhounese and Wenzhounese.

Shanghainese as a branch of Northern Wu can be further subdivided. The details are as follows:

* Urban branch () – what &quot;Shanghainese&quot; tends to refer to. Occupies the city centre of Shanghai, generally on the west bank of the Huangpu River. This can also be further divided into Old, Middle, and New Periods, as well as an emerging Newest Period.

The following are often collectively known as &quot;Bendihua&quot; (, Shanghainese: , Wugniu: &quot;pen-di ghe-gho&quot;)

* Jiading branch () – spoken in the most of Jiading and Baoshan.
* Liantang branch () – spoken in the southwestern ends of Qingpu.
* Chongming branch () – spoken in the islands of Hengsha, Changxing and Chongming, as well as the eastern parts of Nantong.
* Songjiang branch () – spoken in all other parts of Shanghai, which can be further divided into the following:

:* Pudong subbranch () – spoken in all parts of the east bank of the Huangpu River, taking up most of the Pudong district.

:* Shanghai subbranch () – spoken in the rest of the peripheral areas of the city center, namely southern Jiading and Baoshan, as well as northern Minhang.

:* Songjiang subbranch () – spoken in the rest of Shanghai. Named after the Songjiang district.

== Phonology ==

Following conventions of Chinese syllable structure, Shanghainese syllables can be divided into initials and finals. The initial occupies the first part of the syllable. The final occupies the second part of the syllable and can be divided further into an optional medial and an obligatory rime (sometimes spelled &quot;rhyme&quot;). Tone is also a feature of the syllable in Shanghainese. Syllabic tone, which is typical to the other Sinitic languages, has largely become verbal tone in Shanghainese.

=== Initials ===
The following is a list of all initials in Middle Period Shanghainese, as well as the Wugniu romanisation and example characters.

Shanghainese has a set of tenuis, lenis and fortis plosives and affricates, as well as a set of voiceless and voiced fricatives. Alveolo-palatal initials are also present in Shanghainese.

Voiced stops are phonetically voiceless with slack voice phonation in stressed, word initial position. This phonation (often referred to as murmur) also occurs in zero onset syllables, syllables beginning with fricatives, and syllables beginning with sonorants. These consonants are true voiced in intervocalic position. Sonorants are also suggested to be glottalised in dark tones (i.e. tones 1, 5, 7).

=== Finals ===
Being a Wu language, Shanghainese has a large array of vowel sounds. The following is a list of all possible finals in Middle Period Shanghainese, as well as the Wugniu romanisation and example characters.

The transcriptions used above are broad and the following points are of note when pertaining to actual pronunciation:
* is enunciated with any part of the tongue, and is therefore in free variation as .
* is often rounded into .
* The in and are often lowered to , whereas the in and are often lowered to .
* is pronounced as after labials and alveolars, whereas it is after glottal and alveolo-palatal initials.
* High vowels in front of can undergo breaking.
* can be merged into , resulting in one fewer rime.
* Rimes with final are often simply realised with a shortened vowel nucleus when they are not utterance-final.
* Lips are not significantly rounded in rounded vowels, and not significantly unrounded in unrounded ones.
* are similar in pronunciation, differing slightly in lip rounding and height ( respectively). are also similar in pronunciation, differing slightly in vowel height ( respectively).
* Medial is pronounced before rounded vowels.

The Middle Chinese nasal rimes are all merged in Shanghainese. Middle Chinese rimes have become glottal stops, .

=== Tones ===

Shanghainese has five phonetically distinguishable tones for single syllables said in isolation. These tones are illustrated below in tone numbers. In terms of Middle Chinese tone designations, the dark tone category has three tones (dark rising and dark departing tones have merged into one tone), while the light category has two tones (the light level, rising and departing tones have merged into one tone).

Numbers in this table are those used by the Wugniu romanisation scheme.

The conditioning factors which led to the &quot;yin–yang&quot; (light-dark) split still exist in Shanghainese, as they do in most other Wu lects: light tones are only found with voiced initials, namely , while the dark tones are only found with voiceless initials.

The checked tones are shorter, and describe those rimes which end in a glottal stop . That is, both the &quot;yin–yang&quot; distinction and the checked tones are allophonic (dependent on syllabic structure). With this analysis, Shanghainese has only a two-way phonemic tone contrast, falling &quot;vs&quot; rising, and then only in open syllables with voiceless initials. Therefore, many romanisations of Shanghainese opt to only mark the dark level tone, usually with a diacritic such as an acute accent or grave accent.

==== Tone sandhi ====

Tone sandhi is a process whereby adjacent tones undergo dramatic alteration in connected speech. Similar to other Northern Wu dialects, Shanghainese is characterized by two forms of tone sandhi: a word tone sandhi and a phrasal tone sandhi.

Word tone sandhi in Shanghainese can be described as left-prominent and is characterized by a dominance of the first syllable over the contour of the entire tone domain. As a result, the underlying tones of syllables other than the leftmost syllable, have no effect on the tone contour of the domain. The pattern is generally described as tone spreading (1, 5, 6, 7) or tone shifting (8, except for 4-syllable compounds, which can undergo spreading or shifting). The table below illustrates possible tone combinations.

As an example, in isolation, the two syllables of the word (&quot;China&quot;) are pronounced with a dark level tone (&quot;tsón&quot;) and dark checked tone (&quot;koq&quot;): and . However, when pronounced in combination, the dark level tone of (&quot;tsón&quot;) spreads over the compound resulting in the following pattern . Similarly, the syllables in a common expression for (&quot;zeq-sé-ti&quot;, &quot;foolish&quot;) have the following underlying phonemic and tonal representations: (&quot;zeq&quot;), (&quot;sé&quot;), and (&quot;ti&quot;). However, the syllables in combination exhibit the light checked shifting pattern where the first-syllable light checked tone shifts to the last syllable in the domain: .

Phrasal tone sandhi in Shanghainese can be described as right-prominent and is characterized by a right syllable retaining its underlying tone and a left syllable receiving a mid-level tone based on the underlying tone&#x27;s register. The table below indicates possible left syllable tones in right-prominent compounds.

For instance, when combined, (&quot;ma&quot;, , &quot;to buy&quot;) and (&quot;cieu&quot;, , &quot;wine&quot;) become (&quot;to buy wine&quot;).

Sometimes meaning can change based on whether left-prominent or right-prominent sandhi is used. For example, (&quot;tshau&quot;, , &quot;to fry&quot;) and (&quot;mi&quot;, , &quot;noodle&quot;) when pronounced (i.e., with left-prominent sandhi) means &quot;fried noodles&quot;. When pronounced (i.e., with right-prominent sandhi), it means &quot;to fry noodles&quot;.

Nouns and adjectives attached to nouns tend to start left-prominent sandhi chains, whereas right-prominent chains are triggered by verbs and adverbs. Grammatical particles cannot start chains of their own, but instead can be realised as a null tone () or be part of another chain.

In the previous example sentence we see an adjective, noun and pronoun starting sandhi chains, the particles , and being incorporated into other sandhi chains, and the particle having a neutral tone.

== Vocabulary ==
&quot;Note: Chinese characters for Shanghainese are not standardized and those chosen are those recommended in . IPA transcription is for the Middle Period of modern Shanghainese (), pronunciation of those between 20 and 60 years old.&quot;

Due to the large number of migrants into Shanghai, its lexicon is less noticeably Wu, though it still retains many defining features. However, many of these now lost features can be found in lects spoken in suburban Shanghai.

Its basic negator is (&quot;veq&quot;), which according to some linguists, is sufficient ground to classify it as Wu.

Shanghainese also has a multitude of loan words from European languages, due to Shanghai&#x27;s status as a major port in China. Most of these terms come from English, though there are some from other languages such as French. Some terms, such as , have even entered mainstream and other Sinitic languages, such as Sichuanese.

=== Common words and phrases ===
: &quot;For more terms, see on Wiktionary.&quot;

=== Literary and vernacular pronunciations ===

Like other Sinitic languages, Shanghainese exhibits a difference between expected vernacular pronunciations, and literary pronunciations taken from the Mandarinic lingua franca of the time, be it Nanjingnese, Hangzhounese, or Beijingnese.

These readings must be distinguished in vocabulary. Take for instance the following.
Some terms mix the two pronunciation types, such as (&quot;university&quot;), where is literary (da) and is colloquial (ghoq).

== Grammar ==
Like other Sinitic languages, Shanghainese is an isolating language that lacks marking for tense, person, case, number or gender. Similarly, there is no distinction for tense or person in verbs, with word order and particles generally expressing these grammatical characteristics. There are, however, three important derivational processes in Shanghainese. However, some analyses do suggest that one can analyse Shanghainese to have tenses.

Although formal inflection is very rare in all varieties of Chinese, there does exist in Shanghainese a morpho-phonological tone sandhi that Zhu (2006) identifies as a form of inflection since it forms new words out of pre-existing phrases. This type of inflection is a distinguishing characteristic of all Northern Wu dialects.

Affixation, generally (but not always) taking the form of suffixes, occurs rather frequently in Shanghainese, enough so that this feature contrasts even with other Wu varieties, although the line between suffix and particle is somewhat nebulous. Most affixation applies to adjectives. In the example below, the term (&quot;deu-sy&quot;) can be used to change an adjective to a noun.

Words can be reduplicated to express various differences in meaning. Nouns, for example, can be reduplicated to express collective or diminutive forms; adjectives so as to intensify or emphasize the associated description; and verbs to soften the degree of action. Below is an example of noun reduplication resulting in semantic alteration.

Word compounding is also very common in Shanghainese, a fact observed as far back as Edkins (1868), and is the most productive method of creating new words. Many recent borrowings in Shanghainese originating from European languages are di- or polysyllabic.

=== Word order ===
Shanghainese adheres generally to SVO word order. The placement of objects in Wu dialects is somewhat variable, with Southern Wu varieties positioning the direct object before the indirect object, and Northern varieties (especially in the speech of younger people) favoring the indirect object before the direct object. Owing to Mandarin influence, Shanghainese usually follows the latter model.

Older speakers of Shanghainese tend to place adverbs after the verb, but younger people, again under heavy influence from Mandarin, favor pre-verbal placement of adverbs.

The third person singular pronoun (&quot;yi&quot;) (he/she/it) or the derived phrase (&quot;yi kaon&quot;) (&quot;he says&quot;) can appear at the end of a sentence. This construction, which appears to be unique to Shanghainese, is commonly employed to project the speaker&#x27;s differing expectation relative to the content of the phrase.

=== Nouns ===
Except for the limited derivational processes described above, Shanghainese nouns are isolating. There is no inflection for case or number, nor is there any overt gender marking. Although Shanghainese does lack overt grammatical number, the plural marker (&quot;la&quot;), when suffixed to a human denoting noun, can indicate a collective meaning.

There are no articles in Shanghainese, and thus, no marking for definiteness or indefiniteness of nouns. Certain determiners (a demonstrative pronoun or numeral classifier, for instance) can imply definite or indefinite qualities, as can word order. A noun absent any sort of determiner in the subject position is definite, whereas it is indefinite in the object position.

==== Classifiers ====
Shanghainese boasts numerous classifiers (also sometimes known as &quot;counters&quot; or &quot;measure words&quot;). Most classifiers in Shanghainese are used with nouns, although a small number are used with verbs. Some classifiers are based on standard measurements or containers. Classifiers can be paired with a preceding determiner (often a numeral) to form a compound that further specifies the meaning of the noun it modifies.

Classifiers can be reduplicated to mean &quot;all&quot; or &quot;every&quot;, as in:

=== Verbs ===
Shanghainese verbs are analytic and as such do not undergo any sort of conjugation to express tense or person. However, the language does have a richly developed aspect system, expressed using various particles. This system has been argued to be a tense system.

==== Aspect ====
Some disagreement exists as to how many formal aspect categories exist in Shanghainese, and a variety of different particles can express the same aspect, with individual usage often reflecting generational divisions. Some linguists identify as few as four or six, and others up to twelve specific aspects. Zhu (2006) identifies six relatively uncontroversial aspects in Shanghainese.

Progressive aspect expresses a continuous action. It is indicated by the particles (&quot;laq&quot;), (&quot;laq-laq&quot;) or (&quot;laq-he&quot;), which occur pre-verbally.

The resultative aspect expresses the result of an action which was begun before a specifically referenced timeframe, and is also indicated by (&quot;laq&quot;), (&quot;laq-laq&quot;) or (&quot;laq-he&quot;), except that these occur post-verbally.

Perfective aspect can be marked by (&quot;leq&quot;), (&quot;tsy&quot;), (&quot;hau&quot;) or (&quot;le&quot;). is seen as dated and younger speakers often use , likely through lenition and Mandarin influence.

Zhu (2006) identifies a future aspect, indicated by the particle (&quot;iau&quot;).

Qian (1997) identifies a separate immediate future aspect, marked post-verbally by (&quot;khua&quot;).

Experiential aspect expresses the completion of an action before a specifically referenced timeframe, marked post-verbally by the particle (&quot;ku&quot;).

The durative aspect is marked post-verbally by (&quot;gho-chi&quot;), and expresses a continuous action.

In some cases, it is possible to combine two aspect markers into a larger verb phrase.

==== Mood and Voice ====
There is no overt marking for mood in Shanghainese, and Zhu (2006) goes so far as to suggest that the concept of grammatical mood does not exist in the language. There are, however, several modal auxiliaries (many of which have multiple variants) that collectively express concepts of desire, conditionality, potentiality and ability.

Shen (2016) argues for the existence of a type of passive voice in Shanghainese, governed by the particle (&quot;peq&quot;). This construction is superficially similar to by-phrases in English, and only transitive verbs can occur in this form of passive.

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns in Shanghainese do not distinguish gender or case. Owing to its isolating grammatical structure, Shanghainese is not a pro-drop language.


There is some degree of flexibility concerning pronoun usage in Shanghainese. Older varieties of Shanghainese featured a different 1st person plural (&quot;ngu-gni&quot;), whereas younger speakers tend to use (&quot;aq-laq&quot;), which originates from Ningbonese. While Zhu (2006) asserts that there is no inclusive 1st person plural pronoun, Hashimoto (1971) disagrees, identifying as being inclusive. There are generational and geographical distinctions in the usage of plural pronoun forms, as well as differences of pronunciation in the 1st person singular.

Reflexive pronouns are formed by the addition of the particle (&quot;zy-ka&quot;), as in:

Possessive pronouns are formed via the pronominal suffix (&quot;gheq&quot;), for instance, (&quot;ngu gheq&quot;). This pronunciation is a glottalised lenition of the expected pronunciation, &quot;ku&quot;.

=== Adjectives ===
Most basic Shanghainese adjectives are monosyllabic. Like other parts of speech, adjectives do not change to indicate number, gender or case. Adjectives can take semantic prefixes, which themselves can be reduplicated or repositioned as suffixes according to a complex system of derivation, to express degree of comparison or other changes in meaning. Thus:
:: &quot;lan&quot; (&quot;cold&quot;)
:: &quot;pín-lan&quot; (&quot;ice-cold&quot;), where means ice
:: &quot;pín-pín-lan&quot; (&quot;cold as ice&quot;)

=== Interrogatives ===
The particle (&quot;vaq&quot;) is used to transform ordinary declarative statements into yes/no questions. This is the most common way of forming questions in Shanghainese.

=== Negation ===
Nouns and verbs can be negated by the verb (&quot;m-meq&quot;), &quot;to not have&quot;, whereas is the basic negator.

== Writing ==

Chinese characters are often used to write Shanghainese. Though there is no formal standardisations, there are characters recommended for use, mostly based on dictionaries. However, Shanghainese is often informally written using Shanghainese or even Standard Mandarin near-homophones. For instance &quot;lemon&quot; (), written in Standard Chinese, may be written (person-door; Pinyin: , Wugniu: &quot;gnin-men&quot;) in Shanghainese; and &quot;yellow&quot; (, Wugniu: &quot;waon&quot;) may be written (meaning king; Pinyin: , Wugniu: &quot;waon&quot;) rather than the standard character for yellow.

Some of the time, nonstandard characters are used even when trying to use etymologically correct characters, due to compatibility (such as ) or pronunciation shift (such as ).

Correct orthography according to 


Mandarin-influenced orthography

Romanization of Shanghainese was first developed by Protestant English and American Christian missionaries in the 19th century, including Joseph Edkins. Usage of this romanization system was mainly confined to translated Bibles for use by native Shanghainese, or English–Shanghainese dictionaries, some of which also contained characters, for foreign missionaries to learn Shanghainese. A system of phonetic symbols similar to Chinese characters called &quot;New Phonetic Character&quot; were also developed by in the 19th century by American missionary Tarleton Perry Crawford. Since the 21st century, online dictionaries such as the Wu MiniDict and Wugniu have introduced their own Romanization schemes. Nowadays, the MiniDict and Wugniu Romanizations are the most commonly used standardized ones.

Protestant missionaries in the 1800s created the Shanghainese Phonetic Symbols to write Shanghainese phonetically. The symbols are a syllabary similar to the Japanese &quot;kana&quot; system. The system has not been used and is only seen in a few historical books.

== TV shows ==
In the last decade or so, China has been highlighting Shanghai&#x27;s TV landscape, experiencing a surge of new shows featuring famous Shanghainese actors, incorporating Shanghainese in the TV show dialogues, and simply offering the TV show in the Shanghainese dialect. Though the number of Shanghainese/Shanghai based TV shows are still limited, progress is being made through the latest TV series that was just released. Below are a list of a few popular ones:

<doc id="511610" wikidata="Q637582" url="?curid=511610" title="Fallowfield">
<text>Fallowfield is a bustling area of Manchester with a population of 14,869 at the 2021 census. Historically in Lancashire, it lies south of Manchester city centre and is bisected east–west by Wilbraham Road and north–south by Wilmslow Road. The former Fallowfield Loop railway line, now a shared use path, follows a route nearly parallel with the east–west main road (Moseley Road/Wilbraham Road).

The area has a very large student population. The University of Manchester&#x27;s main accommodation complex – the Fallowfield Campus – occupies a large area in the north; this is adjacent to the university&#x27;s Owens Park halls of residence and the Firs Botanical Grounds. In the northwest of the suburb is Platt Fields Park, which is formed from part of the land that once belonged to the Platts of Platt Hall.

==History==

The early medieval linear earthwork Nico Ditch passes through Platt Fields Park in Fallowfield and dates from the 8th or 9th century.

Early Fallowfield was an ill-defined area north of Withington until the mid-19th century. The first mention of Fallowfield is in a deed of 1317 (as &quot;Fallafeld&quot;). During the 14th century at least part of the land in Fallowfield was held by Jordan de Fallafeld. In 1530 it was mentioned as &quot;Falowfelde&quot;. Withington formed a sub-manor within the large Manor of Manchester. The Platt Estate in the north was first owned by the Platts and later by the Worsleys. The building of Wilbraham Road to connect Fallowfield with Edge Lane in Chorlton-cum-Hardy in 1869 enabled development west of the Wilmslow Road crossing. Some wealthy people (e.g. Joseph Whitworth, &quot;The Firs&quot;, and the Behrens family, &quot;The Oaks&quot;) built mansions in the area and in the early 20th century the university began to establish halls of residence (the earliest being Ashburne Hall, 1910, in a house donated by the family of Behrens) which have since become very extensive. There was a second period of building houses by members of the prosperous middle class in the 1850s: these included Egerton Lodge, Norton House and Oak House, while the Manchester architect Alfred Waterhouse built Barcombe Cottage as his own home on Oak Drive.

Under the Poor Law Fallowfield formed part of the Chorlton Poor Law Union (administered from Chorlton-on-Medlock). From 1876 to 1894 Fallowfield was included in the area of the Withington Local Board of Health which was replaced by the Withington Urban District Council in 1894. In 1895 Rusholme and the northern part of Fallowfield were incorporated into the city of Manchester. In 1904 the whole of the urban district was absorbed into the city of Manchester, though until 1914 there was a separate Withington Committee of the Corporation and rates were lower than in the rest of the city.

In 1891 Fallowfield railway station on the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway&#x27;s line from Chorlton-cum-Hardy to Fairfield was opened. During the first half of the 20th century the Manchester Corporation tramway on Moseley and Wilbraham Roads provided access to other southern suburbs and via Princess Road to the city centre. In 1986 the UK&#x27;s first drive-through McDonald&#x27;s opened in Fallowfield. and more recently a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket has been opened on the site of the railway station.

==Governance==

Following boundary changes in 2018, different parts of the Fallowfield ward (which does not coincide with the area popularly known as Fallowfield) are parts of Manchester Gorton and Manchester Central parliamentary constituencies.

;Councillors
Fallowfield ward is represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors, Ali Ilyas, Zahra Alijah and Jade Doswell of the Labour Party. Former Fallowfield Councillor Peter Morrison served as an Honorary Alderman for the city.

==Geography==
Ladybarn is the part of Fallowfield to the south-east. Chancellors Hotel &amp; Conference Centre is used by the University of Manchester: it was built by Edward Walters for Sir Joseph Whitworth, as were the Firs Botanical Grounds.

Holy Innocents Church (Anglican) stands on Wilbraham Road: the church was built in 1870–72 by the architects Price &amp; Linklater using sandstone masonry. The style is Gothic revival and in 1983–84 the interior of the church was altered to designs by the Ellis Williams Partnership. The church was damaged by fire in 1954. The tower is at the south-east corner and is topped by an octagonal spire. The stained glass windows are mostly of the 1890s. After the closing of the nearby parish church of St James, Birch, in 1979 the two parishes were united under the name of the parish of Holy Innocents and St James. There is a student-friendly independent church meeting in the 256 bar next door (Ivy Fallowfield Church) and a Union Baptist Chapel not far away southwards. There is also a Seventh-day Adventist church in Wilbraham Road.

Wilbraham Road is also the site of the stylistically eclectic and, for its time, structurally innovative former South Manchester Synagogue (1913–2003). The building has now been converted to other uses.

Platt Chapel on Wilmslow Road south of Grangethorpe Road was a family chapel of the Worsleys of Platt Hall built in 1699. The present building is a rebuilding of 1790 modified in 1874–75. The congregation began as Independents (Congregationalists) and became Unitarian during the early 19th century. Since it ceased to be used for worship in 1970 it has been used by various local societies. The graveyard, which used to be larger, is surrounded by Platt Fields Park.

==Education==
Lady Barn House School, an independent primary school, was founded in Fallowfield in 1873 by William Henry Herford and took its name from the existing Ladybarn House which became its second home. In the 1950s, it moved to Cheadle. 

Other schools and colleges in Fallowfield are:
* Holy Innocents Primary School (the former school buildings are next to the Holy Innocents Church and have been converted to other uses, they were built in 1882 to the designs of F. H. Oldham)
* Manchester Grammar School, a notable independent school which moved to Old Hall Lane from the city centre
* Moseley Road School (Levenshulme High School and Lower School)
* Princess Christian College (for the training of nannies) on Wilbraham Road
* Manchester High School for Girls on Grangethorpe Road 
* Hollings College (also known as the Toast Rack building) campus of the Manchester Metropolitan University at the junction of Old Hall Lane with Wilmslow Road. Hollings campus was closed down in 2013 and then sold.

Until 1958, Fallowfield had its own railway station, located on Wilmslow Road, which provided trains between Manchester Central Station and Fairfield and . The site is now occupied by a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket and a block of flats; the station building itself serving as a Sainsbury&#x27;s cafe. The railway line continued as a freight line until it was closed in 1988. After years of the line lying derelict, the old trackbed was repurposed around 2001 as a shared use path and, today, the Fallowfield Loop route runs from Fairfield station to St Werburgh&#x27;s Road Metrolink station. The route is run by Sustrans and forms part of Routes 6 and 60 of the National Cycle Network.

==Sport==

The 1893 FA Cup Final was played at Fallowfield Stadium, in which Wolverhampton Wanderers beat Everton 1–0, with Harry Allen scoring the only goal of the game. The stadium also hosted the cycling events for the 1934 British Empire Games, the Amateur Athletic Association championships in 1897 and 1907 and two Northern Rugby Football Union (later Rugby Football League) Challenge Cup finals in 1899 and 1900. It was demolished in 1994, and the site is now Manchester University&#x27;s Richmond Park Halls of Residence.

==Musical associations==
A TV broadcast called the Gospel and Blues Train featuring Muddy Waters, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and other blues singers was recorded by Granada TV at Wilbraham Road railway station on Thursday, 7 May 1964, after the station was closed to passenger traffic.

Fallowfield was the subject of the penultimate track on Manchester band the Courteeners debut album, &quot;St Jude&quot;, entitled &quot;Fallowfield Hillbilly&quot;.
The Chemical Brothers met at the University of Manchester and played their first gig at &#x27;The Bop&#x27;, a popular student night that was located within the University of Manchester&#x27;s Owens Park halls of residence.

<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation, sometimes referred to as simply Vacation, is a 1983 American black comedy road film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Chevy Chase, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, Imogene Coca, Randy Quaid, John Candy, and Christie Brinkley in her acting debut with special appearances by Eddie Bracken, Brian Doyle-Murray, Miriam Flynn, James Keach, Eugene Levy, and Frank McRae. It tells the fictitious story of the Griswold family on a cross-country trip to an amusement park and various locations as accidents occur along the way. The screenplay was written by John Hughes on the basis of his short story &quot;Vacation &#x27;58&quot;, which appeared in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;.

The film was a box-office hit, earning more than $60 million in the U.S. alone with an estimated budget of $15 million.

As a result of its success, five sequels have been produced: &quot;European Vacation&quot; (1985), &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; (1989), &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot; (1997), &quot;Christmas Vacation 2&quot; (2003), and &quot;Vacation&quot; (2015). In 2000, readers of &quot;Total Film&quot; voted it the 46th greatest comedy film of all time.

==Plot==
Clark Griswold, wanting to spend more time with his wife Ellen and children Rusty and Audrey, decides to lead the family on a cross-country expedition from the Chicago suburbs to the southern California amusement park Walley World, billed as &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Family Fun Park&quot;. Ellen wants to fly, but Clark insists on driving so he can bond with his family. He has ordered a new car in preparation for the trip, but the dealer claims that it will not be ready for six weeks. Clark is forced to buy the &quot;Wagon Queen Family Truckster&quot;, an ugly, oversized station wagon after the car he traded in has been crushed.

During the family&#x27;s travels, they experience numerous mishaps, such as being tagged by vandals after taking a wrong turn in St. Louis, Missouri. Clark aggravates a bartender in Dodge City, Kansas, and is tantalized on numerous occasions by a beautiful young woman driving a Ferrari 308 GTS.

The Griswolds stop in Coolidge, Kansas, to visit Ellen&#x27;s cousin Catherine and her husband Eddie, who foist cranky Aunt Edna and her mean dog Dinky on the Griswolds, asking them to drop her off at her son Norman&#x27;s home in Phoenix.

After stopping at a decrepit and dirty campground in South Fork, Colorado, for the night, Clark forgets to untie Dinky&#x27;s leash from the rear bumper before driving off the next morning, killing the dog. A motorcycle cop pulls the Griswolds over and angrily lectures Clark over animal cruelty but accepts Clark&#x27;s apology. Edna learns of this and becomes irate with Clark for killing her dog. Exiting Colorado, Ellen loses her bag that had her credit cards, and Clark reports them as lost.

While Ellen and Clark argue during a drive between Utah and Arizona, they crash and become stranded in the desert near Monument Valley. After setting off alone to look for help for hours, Clark reunites with his family, who have been rescued and taken to a local mechanic. The mechanic, also the town sheriff, extorts Clark&#x27;s remaining cash, only to render the car barely operational. Frustrated, the family stops at the Grand Canyon. When Clark is unable to convince a hotel clerk to cash a personal check because his credit cards have mistakenly been reported lost, he raids the cash register behind the clerk&#x27;s back and leaves the check.

Continuing their drive, the Griswolds find that Aunt Edna has died in her sleep. They tie her corpse to the roof of the car, wrapped in a tarpaulin. Discovering that Norman is out of town when they arrive at his home, they attach a note to the corpse and leave it in the back yard.

Overwhelmed by the mishaps they have encountered, Ellen and the children want to go home, but Clark has become obsessed with reaching Walley World. After an argument with Ellen, Clark meets the Ferrari-driving blonde at a hotel bar, weaves several lies to impress her, and swims naked with her in the hotel pool. They are quickly discovered by the family due to Clark yelling about the cold temperature. Clark tells the woman the truth, and they part ways amicably. Ellen forgives Clark, and they go swimming naked themselves.

The Griswolds arrive at Walley World, only to discover the park closed for the next two weeks for repairs. Slipping into madness over his efforts being for nothing, Clark buys a realistic-looking BB gun and demands that park security guard Russ Lasky take them through Walley World. An LAPD SWAT team soon arrives, but as the family is about to be arrested, park owner Roy Walley shows up to de-escalate the situation. Roy understands Clark&#x27;s longing to achieve the perfect vacation, bringing back memories of his own family vacation troubles. He decides not to file criminal charges against the Griswolds and lets the family – along with the SWAT team – enjoy the park as his guests.

A montage of snapshots taken during the trip is shown during the credits, ending with one that shows the Griswolds flying back to Chicago.

==Cast==
==Production==
During the Chicago blizzard of 1979, writer John Hughes began developing a short story titled &quot;Vacation &#x27;58&quot; for an issue of the &quot;National Lampoon.&quot; While the story ended up being bumped from the initial vacation-themed issue, it was eventually published in September 1979 and subsequently optioned by Warner Bros. &quot;When I brought it to Hollywood, the first guy I brought it to was Jeff Katzenberg who was at Paramount,&quot; recalled producer Matty Simmons, who worked as a publisher at the &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. &quot;He said it would never make a movie, it was too episodic, too consequential. I said, &#x27;Yeah, it&#x27;s a road trip. It&#x27;s supposed to be episodic. You go from town to town, place to place.&#x27; But he didn&#x27;t like it, so then my agent brought it to Warner Brothers, and I met with them. Most of them said the same thing, but there was one executive over there—a guy named Mark Canton—who really pulled for it and it got made.&quot;

Upon Simmons&#x27; agreement with Warner Bros., Hughes was tasked with adapting his original story into a screenplay. Harold Ramis and Chevy Chase rewrote Hughes&#x27;s first draft to place the story from the father&#x27;s point of view rather than the son&#x27;s.

===Filming===
Filming began on July 5, 1982, in Boone, Colorado, and lasted 55 days. Parts of the film were shot in Monument Valley, Utah; Flagstaff, Sedona, and the Grand Canyon in Arizona; Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia and Magic Mountain in California; Southern Colorado, and St. Louis, Missouri.

The original ending of the film, which involved the Griswolds taking Roy Walley hostage, was judged poorly by test audiences. A new ending featuring John Candy was filmed in its place; in this revised ending, shot several months after the rest of the film, Anthony Michael Hall has become noticeably taller. The original ending is discussed in the film&#x27;s commentary track, but has not been issued in any format since the test screenings.

===Walley World===
In Hughes&#x27; original short story, the theme park was Disneyland. To avoid legal troubles, all of the names associated with Disneyland were altered to sound-alikes. For instance, the park became Walley World, itself a good-natured parody of the Anaheim location, and the mascot, Marty Moose, is reminiscent of Walt Disney&#x27;s own Mickey Mouse. Similarly, Roy Walley&#x27;s appearance bears similarities to that of Disney and his name is similar to that of his brother Roy Disney.

In the film, the Walley World theme park is represented by Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California and Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California. Santa Anita Park&#x27;s large parking lot and blue-tinged fascia served as the exterior of Walley World, while all park interior scenes were shot at Magic Mountain. The two roller coasters seen in the film are La Revolución, which can be recognized by the vertical loop, and Colossus (currently Twisted Colossus), the double-track wooden roller coaster.

The movie&#x27;s popularity gave rise to an ongoing cultural running gag of using the name &quot;Wally World&quot; (spelled without an &quot;e&quot;) as a nickname for real-life retailer Walmart.

===Wagon Queen Family Truckster===

The Wagon Queen Family Truckster station wagon was created specifically for the film. It is based on a 1979 Ford LTD Country Squire station wagon. The car was designed by Warner Bros. The Truckster features a &quot;metallic pea&quot; green paint scheme, extensive imitation wood-paneling decals, eight headlights (the second pair was taken from another Crown Victoria/Country Squire and mounted upside-down above the stock pair), a grille area largely covered by bodywork with only two small openings close to the bumper, an oddly placed fuel filler door and an airbag made from a trashcan liner.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; was composed by Ralph Burns, featuring original songs by Lindsey Buckingham. A soundtrack album was released in 1983 by Warner Bros. Records. While the album did not chart, Buckingham&#x27;s single &quot;Holiday Road&quot; reached number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; opened theatrically in 1,175 venues on July 29, 1983, and earned $8,333,358 in its opening weekend, ranking number one at the domestic box office. The film grossed $61,399,552.

===Critical response===
&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; received positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 94% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Blessed by a brilliantly befuddled star turn from Chevy Chase, &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; is one of the more consistent – and thoroughly quotable – screwball comedies of the 1980s.&quot; On Metacritic it has a 55 out of 100 rating based on 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale; the company&#x27;s founder, Ed Mintz, said in 2016, &quot;I loved it ... I couldn&#x27;t figure out for anything why people didn&#x27;t love that more&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;&quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, which is more controlled than other Lampoon movies have been, is careful not to stray too far from its target. The result is a confident humor and throwaway style that helps sustain the laughs – of which there are quite a few.&quot; Entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an enjoyable trip through familiar comedy landscapes&quot; and praised &quot;director Harold Ramis for populating the film with a host of well-known comedic performers in passing parts.&quot; Conversely, Richard Rayner of &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine said, &quot;The visual gags come thick and fast, and are about as subtly signposted as the exit markers on a freeway. An exercise in the comedy of humiliation which is the stuff of shamefaced giggles.&quot;

<text>Cultured meat, also known as cultivated meat among other names, is a form of cellular agriculture wherein meat is produced by culturing animal cells &quot;in vitro&quot;; thus growing animal flesh, moleculary identical to that of conventional livestock, outside of a living animal. Cultured meat is produced using tissue engineering techniques pioneered in regenerative medicine. It has been noted for potential in mitigating the environmental impact of meat production and addressing issues regarding animal welfare, food security and human health.

Jason Matheny popularized the concept in the early 2000s after he co-authored a paper on cultured meat production and created New Harvest, the world&#x27;s first non-profit organization dedicated to &quot;in vitro&quot; meat research. In 2013, Mark Post created a hamburger patty made from tissue grown outside of an animal; other cultured meat prototypes have gained media attention since. In 2020, SuperMeat opened a farm-to-fork restaurant in Tel Aviv called The Chicken, serving cultured chicken burgers in exchange for reviews to test consumer reaction rather than money; while the &quot;world&#x27;s first commercial sale of cell-cultured meat&quot; occurred in December 2020 at Singapore restaurant 1880, where cultured chicken manufactured by United States firm Eat Just was sold.

Most efforts focus on common meats such as pork, beef, and chicken; species which constitute the bulk of conventional meat consumption in developed countries. Some companies have pursued various species of fish and other seafood, such as Avant Meats who brought cultured grouper to market in 2021. Other companies such as Orbillion Bio have focused on high-end or unusual meats including elk, lamb, bison, and Wagyu beef. 

The production process of cultured meat is constantly evolving, driven by companies and research institutions. The applications for cultured meat havе led to ethical, health, environmental, cultural, and economic discussions. Data published by The Good Food Institute found that in 2021 through 2023, cultured meat and seafood companies attracted over $2.5 billion in investment worldwide. However, cultured meat is not yet widely available.

On the 6th February 2025 it was announced that UK Pet-food company THE PACK, will release the first commercially available product for pets containing cultivated chicken made by Meatly into Pets at Home on the 7th February 2025.

== Nomenclature ==

Besides &quot;cultured meat&quot;, the terms &quot;healthy meat&quot;, &quot;slaughter-free meat&quot;, &quot;in vitro meat&quot;, &quot;vat-grown meat&quot;, &quot;lab-grown meat&quot;, &quot;cell-based meat&quot;, &quot;clean meat&quot;, &quot;cultivated meat&quot; and &quot;synthetic meat&quot; have been used to describe the product. Although it has multiple meanings, &quot;artificial meat&quot; is occasionally used.

Between 2016 and 2019, &quot;clean meat&quot; gained traction. The Good Food Institute (GFI) coined the term in 2016, and in late 2018, the institute published research claiming that use of &quot;clean&quot; better reflected the production process and benefits. By 2018 it had surpassed &quot;cultured&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; in media mentions and Google searches. Some industry stakeholders felt that the term unnecessarily tarnished conventional meat producers, continuing to prefer &quot;cell-based meat&quot; as a neutral alternative.

In September 2019, GFI announced new research which found that the term &quot;cultivated meat&quot; is sufficiently descriptive and differentiating, possesses a high degree of neutrality, and ranks highly for consumer appeal. A September 2021 poll indicated that the majority of industry CEOs have a preference for &quot;cultivated meat&quot;, with 75 percent of 44 companies preferring it.

== History ==
=== Initial research ===
The theoretical possibility of growing meat in an industrial setting has long been of interest. In a 1931 essay published by various periodicals and later included in his work &quot;Thoughts and Adventures&quot;, British statesman Winston Churchill wrote: &quot;We shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium.&quot;

In the 1950s, Dutch researcher Willem van Eelen independently came up with the idea for cultured meat. As a prisoner of war during the Second World War, Van Eelen suffered from starvation, leaving him passionate about food production and food security. He attended a university lecture discussing the prospects of preserved meat. The earlier discovery of cell lines provided the basis for the idea. &quot;In vitro&quot; cultivation of muscle fibers was first performed successfully in 1971 when pathologist Russell Ross cultured guinea pig aorta. In 1991, Jon F. Vein secured patent for the production of tissue-engineered meat for human consumption, wherein muscle and fat would be grown in an integrated fashion to create food products.

In 2001, dermatologist Wiete Westerhof along with van Eelen and businessperson Willem van Kooten announced that they had filed for a worldwide patent on a process to produce cultured meat. The process employed a matrix of collagen seeded with muscle cells bathed in a nutritious solution and induced to divide. That same year, NASA began conducting cultured meat experiments, with the intent of allowing astronauts to grow meat instead of transporting it. In partnership with Morris Benjaminson, they cultivated goldfish and turkey. In 2003, Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr exhibited a few centimeters of &quot;steak&quot;, grown from frog stem cells, which they cooked and ate. The goal was to start a conversation surrounding the ethics of cultured meat—&quot;was it ever alive?&quot;, &quot;was it ever killed?&quot;, &quot;is it in any way disrespectful to an animal to throw it away?&quot;

In the early 2000s, American public health student Jason Matheny traveled to India and visited a factory chicken farm. Appalled by the implications of this system, he later teamed up with three scientists involved in NASA&#x27;s efforts. In 2004, Matheny founded New Harvest to encourage development by funding research. In 2005, the four published the first peer-reviewed literature on the subject.

In May 2008, PETA offered a $1 million prize to the first company to bring cultured chicken meat to consumers by 2012. The contestant was required to complete two tasks to earn the prize, namely to produce a cultured chicken meat product that was indistinguishable from real chicken and produce the product in large enough quantities to be competitively sold in at least 10 states. The contest was later extended until 4 March 2014. The deadline eventually expired without a winner.

The Dutch government has invested $4 million into experiments regarding cultured meat. The In Vitro Meat Consortium, a group formed by international researchers, held the first international conference hosted by the Norwegian Food Research Institute in April 2008. &quot;Time&quot; magazine declared cultured meat production to be one of the 50 breakthrough ideas of 2009. In November 2009, scientists from the Netherlands announced they had managed to grow meat using cells from a live pig.

===First public trial===
The first cultured beef burger patty was created by Mark Post at Maastricht University in 2013. It was made from over 20,000 thin strands of muscle tissue, cost over $325,000 and needed 2 years to produce. The burger was tested on live television in London on 5 August 2013. It was cooked by chef Richard McGeown of Couch&#x27;s Great House Restaurant in Polperro, Cornwall, and tasted by critics Hanni Rützler, a food researcher from the Future Food Studio, and Josh Schonwald. Rützler stated, &quot;There is really a bite to it, there is quite some flavour with the browning. I know there is no fat in it so I didn&#x27;t really know how juicy it would be, but there is quite some intense taste; it&#x27;s close to meat, it&#x27;s not that juicy, but the consistency is perfect. This is meat to me... It&#x27;s really something to bite on and I think the look is quite similar.&quot; Rützler added that even in a blind trial she would have taken the product for meat rather than a soya copy.

===Industry development===
Between 2011 and 2017, many cultured meat startups were launched. Memphis Meats, now known as Upside Foods, launched a video in February 2016, showcasing its cultured beef meatball. In March 2017, it showcased chicken tenders and duck a l&#x27;orange, the first cultured poultry shown to the public. An Israeli company, SuperMeat, ran a crowdfunding campaign in 2016, for its work on cultured chicken. Finless Foods, a San Francisco-based company working on cultured fish, was founded in June 2016. In March 2017 it commenced laboratory operations.

In March 2018, Eat Just (in 2011 founded as Hampton Creek in San Francisco, later known as Just, Inc.) claimed to be able to offer a consumer product from cultured meat by the end of 2018. According to CEO Josh Tetrick the technology was already there. JUST had about 130 employees and a research department of 55 scientists, where cultured meat from poultry, pork and beef was researched. JUST has received investments from Chinese billionaire Li Ka-shing, Yahoo! co-founder Jerry Yang and according to Tetrick also by Heineken International and others.

Dutch startup Meatable, consisting of Krijn de Nood, Daan Luining, Ruud Out, Roger Pederson, Mark Kotter and Gordana Apic among others, reported in September 2018 that it had succeeded in growing meat using pluripotent stem cells from animal umbilical cords. Although such cells are reportedly difficult to work with, Meatable claimed to be able to direct them to behave to become muscle or fat cells as needed. The major advantage is that this technique bypasses fetal bovine serum, meaning that no animal has to be killed to produce meat. That month, an estimated 30 cultured meat startups operated across the world. IntegriCulture is a Japan-based company working on their CulNet system. Competitors included England based Multus Media and Canadian Future Fields.

In August 2019, five American startups announced the formation of the Alliance for Meat, Poultry &amp; Seafood Innovation (AMPS Innovation), a coalition seeking to work with regulators to create a pathway to market for cultured meat and seafood. The founding members include Eat Just, Memphis Meats, Finless Foods, BlueNalu, and Fork &amp; Goode. Similarly in December 2021, a group of 13 European and Israeli companies (Aleph Farms, Bluu Biosciences, Cubiq Foods, Future Meat, Gourmey, Higher Steaks, Ivy Farm, Meatable, Mirai Foods, Mosa Meat, Peace of Meat, SuperMeat, and Vital Meat) established Cellular Agriculture Europe, a Belgium-based association that sought to &#x27;find common ground and speak with a shared voice for the good of the industry, consumers, and regulators&#x27;.

In October 2019, Aleph Farms collaborated with 3D Bioprinting Solutions to culture meat on the International Space Station. This was done by extruding meat cells onto a scaffold using a 3D printer. In January 2020, &quot;Quartz&quot; found around 30 cultured meat startups, and that Memphis Meats, Just Inc. and Future Meat Technologies were the most advanced because they were building pilot plants. According to &quot;New Scientist&quot; in May 2020, 60 start-ups were developing cultured meat. Some of these were technology suppliers. Growth media reportedly still cost &quot;hundreds of dollars per litre, but for clean meat production to scale this needs to drop to around $1 a litre.&quot; In June 2020, Chinese government officials called for a national strategy to compete in cultured meat.

In December 2019, the Foieture project was launched in Belgium with the goal of developing cultured foie gras (the name is a portmanteau of &#x27;foie&#x27; and &#x27;future&#x27;) by a consortium of 3 companies (cultured-meat startup Peace of Meat, small meat-seasoning company Solina, and small pâté-producing company Nauta) and 3 non-profit institutes (university KU Leuven, food industry innovation centre Flanders Food, and Bio Base Europe Pilot Plant). Peace of Meat stated in December 2019 that it intended to complete its proof of concept in 2020, to produce its first prototype in 2022, and to go to market in 2023. That month, the Foieture project received a research grant of almost 3.6 million euros from the Innovation and Enterprise Agency of the Flemish Government. In May 2020, Peace of Meat&#x27;s Austrian-born cofounder and scientific researcher Eva Sommer stated that the startup was then able to produce 20 grams of cultured fat at a cost of about 300 euros (€15,000/kg); the goal was to reduce the price to 6 euros per kilogram by 2030. Piece of Meat built two laboratories in the Port of Antwerp. In late 2020, MeaTech acquired Peace of Meat for 15 million euros, and announced in May 2021 that it would build a new large-scale pilot plant in Antwerp by 2022.

In November 2020, Indian start-up Clear Meat claimed it had managed to cultivate chicken mince at the cost of only 800–850 Indian rupees (US$10.77–11.44), while a slaughtered processed chicken cost about 1,000 rupees. On 27 April 2022, the European Commission approved the request for the collection of signatures for the European Citizens&#x27; Initiative &quot;End The Slaughter Age&quot; to shift subsidies from animal husbandry to cellular agriculture.

According to a November 2023 report by Oghma Partners, 46.9% of all funds – over 2.6 billion British pounds – raised for cultivated meat start-ups between 2016 and 2023 went to a top five, comprising Upside Foods (21.5%; formerly Memphis Meats), Believer Meats (formerly Future Meat Technologies), Wildtype, Aleph Farms, and Mosa Meat.

=== Market entry ===
==== European Union entry ====
In the European Union, novel foods such as cultured meat products have to go through a testing period of about 18 months during which a company must prove to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that their product is safe. In March 2022, cultured meat producers had reached the level of attempting to gain regulatory approval from European Union supranational institutions coming just before mass goods could be sold to consumers. By February 2023, none had yet submitted a novel food dossier for approval by the EFSA. Legal experts explained this as having to do with the fact that, although the EFSA&#x27;s novel food procedure has been well-established since 1997 (unlike in other jurisdictions, that still have or had to develop certain regulatory standards), it is a long and complicated process in which companies can have little input once they have submitted their request, unlike cultured meat startups in the United States (who could easily communicate back and forth with the FDA to clarify any issues), and in the UK, Singapore and Israel (where governments have implemented a &#x27;single point of contact&#x27; responsible for the overall process).

In April 2024, the Dutch start-up Meatable was the first in the EU to receive regulatory approval from the EFSA for a public proof of concept tasting of cultured meat, in this case sausage, amid much international and national media attention. Meatable CTO Daan Luining cautioned it would take several years to scale up production to serve all supermarkets, that cultured meat was just an alternative that would gradually become more widely available, giving consumers more choices, and that the traditional meat industry would not be replaced any time soon.

==== Israel entry ====
In November 2020, SuperMeat opened a test restaurant in Ness Ziona, Israel, right next to its pilot plant; journalists, experts and a small number of consumers could book an appointment to taste the novel food there, while looking through a glass window into the production facility on the other side. The restaurant was not yet fully open to the public, because as of June 2021 SuperMeat still needed to wait for regulatory approval to start mass production for public consumption, and because the COVID-19 pandemic restricted restaurant operations. By February 2023, Israeli authorities had established a regulatory structure similar to that of Singapore, and shown a general willingness to work towards approval (as well as financing research for cultivated food innovation), but were still in the process of developing safety regulations in consultations with researchers and other experts. For example, the Israeli Health Ministry and UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) co-organised a convention of cultivated food safety regulation experts in September 2022.

In January 2024, the Ministry of Health in Israel granted regulatory approval for cultured beef to Aleph Farms.

==== Singapore entry ====
On 2 December 2020, the Singapore Food Agency approved the &quot;chicken bites&quot; produced by Eat Just for commercial sale. It marked the first time that a cultured meat product passed the safety review (which took 2 years) of a food regulator, and was widely regarded as a milestone for the industry. The chicken bits were scheduled for introduction in Singaporean restaurants. Restaurant &quot;1880&quot; became the first to serve cultured meat to customers on Saturday 19 December 2020.

In January 2023, the SFA also granted regulatory approval for the production of cultured meat with serum-free media to Eat Just&#x27; subsidiary GOOD Meat, which had introduced its clean chicken product in several more Singaporese restaurants as well as hawker centres and food delivery services since 2020, and was constructing the bioreactors for its new facility in Singapore. This world-first approval was said to be a milestone in making cultivated meat production more scalable and efficient. In April 2024, Australian start-up Vow obtained Singaporean approval for its cultured quail; while Dutch start-up Meatable would be introducing its cultivated pork sausages in several restaurants in Singapore later in 2024.

==== United States entry ====
In November 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) completed the pre-market consultation of Upside Foods (formerly Memphis Meats), concluding that its products were safe to eat, a first for cultivated meat companies in the United States. Approval from the final agency, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was received by Upside Foods and Good Meat, both for cultivated chicken, in June 2023.

== Companies working on cultured meat ==
== Process ==
===Cell lines===
Cellular agriculture requires cell lines, generally stem cells. Stem cells are undifferentiated cells which have the potential to become many or all of the required kinds of specialized cell types. Totipotent stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into all the different cell types found within the body. Pluripotent stem cells can mature into all cell types save those in the placenta, and multipotent stem cells can differentiate into several specialized cell types within one lineage. Unipotent stem cells can differentiate into one specific cell fate.

While pluripotent stem cells would be an ideal source, the most prominent example of this subcategory is embryonic stem cells which—due to ethical issues—are controversial for use in research. As a result, scientists have developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)—essentially multipotent blood and skin cells that have been regressed to a pluripotent state enabling them to differentiate into a greater range of cells. The alternative is using multipotent adult stem cells that give rise to muscle cell lineages or unipotent progenitors which differentiate into muscle cells.

Favourable characteristics of stem cells include immortality, proliferative ability, unreliance on adherence, serum independence and easy differentiation into tissue. The natural presence of such characteristics are likely to differ across cell species and origin. As such, &quot;in vitro&quot; cultivation must be adjusted to fill the exact needs of a specific cell line. The immortality issue is that cells have a limit on the number of times they can divide that is dictated by their telomere cap—supplementary nucleotide bases added to the end of their chromosomes. With each division, the telomere cap progressively shortens until nothing remains, at which time the cells cease to divide. Induced pluripotency can lengthen telomere cap such that the cells divide indefinitely.

Cell lines can be collected from a primary source, i.e., through a biopsy on an animal under local anesthesia. They could also be established from secondary sources such as cryopreserved cultures (cultures frozen after previous research).

===Growth medium===

Once cell lines are established, they are immersed in a culture medium to induce them to proliferate. Culture media are typically formulated from basal media that provide cells with necessary carbohydrates, fats, proteins and salts. Once a cell consumes a sufficient amount, it divides and the population increases exponentially. Culture media can be supplemented with additives—for instance sera—that supply additional growth factors. Growth factors can be secreted proteins or steroids that are crucial in regulating cellular processes.

Once differentiation begins, muscle fibres begin to contract and generate lactic acid. Cells&#x27; ability to absorb nutrients and proliferate in part depends on the pH of their environment. As lactic acid accumulates within the medium, the environment will become progressively more acidic and falls below the optimal pH. As a result, culture media must be frequently refreshed. This helps refresh the concentration of nutrients from the basal media.

===Scaffold===

In the case of structured meat products—products that are characterized by their overall configuration as well as cell type—cells must be seeded to scaffolds. Scaffolds are essentially molds meant to reflect and encourage the cells to organize into a larger structure. When cells develop &quot;in vivo&quot;, they are influenced by their interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is the 3-dimensional mesh of glycoproteins, collagen and enzymes responsible for transmitting mechanical and biochemical cues to the cell. Scaffolds need to simulate the characteristics of the ECM.

==== Porosity ====
Pores are minute openings on the surface of the scaffold. They can be created on the surface of the biomaterial in order to release cellular components that could interfere with tissue development. They also help diffuse gas and nutrients to the innermost layers of adherent cells, preventing a &quot;necrotic center&quot; from forming. A necrotic center is a phenomenon in which cells that are not in direct contact with the culture medium die from a lack of nutrients.

==== Vascularization ====
Vascular tissue found in plants contains the organs responsible for internally transporting fluids. It forms natural topographies that provide a low cost way to promote cell alignment by replicating the natural physiological state of myoblasts. It may also help with gas and nutrient exchange.

==== Biochemical properties====
A scaffold&#x27;s biochemical properties should be similar to those of the ECM. It must facilitate cell adhesion through textural qualities or chemical bonding. Additionally, it must produce the chemical cues that encourage cell differentiation. Alternatively, the material should be able to blend with other substances which have these functional qualities.

==== Crystallinity ====
The degree of a material&#x27;s crystallinity determines qualities such as rigidity. High crystallinity can be attributed to hydrogen bonding which in turn increases thermal stability, tensile strength (important for maintaining the scaffold&#x27;s shape), water retention (important for hydrating the cells) and Young&#x27;s modulus.

==== Degradation ====
Certain materials degrade into compounds that are beneficial to cells, although this degradation can also be irrelevant or detrimental. Degradation allows easy removal of the scaffold from the finished product leaving only animal tissue—thereby increasing its resemblance to &quot;in vivo&quot; meat. This degradation can be induced by exposure to certain enzymes which do not impact the muscle tissue.

==== Edibility ====
If scaffolds are unable to be removed from the animal tissue, they must be edible to ensure consumer safety. It would be beneficial if they were to be made out of nutritious ingredients. Since 2010, academic research groups and companies have emerged in order to identify raw materials that have the characteristics of suitable scaffolds.

==== Cellulose ====
Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in nature and provides the exoskeletons of plant leaves. Due to its abundance, it can be obtained at a relatively low cost. It is also versatile and biocompatible. Through a process called &quot;decellularization&quot;, it is coated in a surfactant that creates pores. These pores release the plant&#x27;s cellular components, and it becomes decellularized plant tissue. This material has been extensively studied by the Pelling and Gaudette Groups at University of Ottawa and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, respectively. Through cross-linking (forming covalent bonds between individual polymer chains to hold them together) the plant tissue&#x27;s mechanical properties can be changed so that it more closely resembles muscle tissue. This can also be done by blending plant tissue with other materials. On the other hand, decellularized plant tissue typically lacks mammalian biochemical cues, so it needs to be coated with compensatory functional proteins. C2C12 growth was not shown to change significantly between the bare scaffold and the same scaffold with a coating of collagen or gelatin proteins; however, seeding efficiency (rate at which cells attach to the scaffold) improved.

An advantage of decellularized plant tissue is the natural topography afforded by the leaf vasculature. This helps replicate the natural physiological state of the myoblasts which promotes cell alignment. The other ways of doing this are usually quite a bit more expensive including 3D printing, soft lithography and photolithography. Vascularization can also help overcome the 100–200 nm diffusion limit of culture medium into cells that usually produce necrotic centres in muscle conglomerates. Another way to do this is by having a porous scaffold which supports angiogenesis (the development of new blood vessels). While this has been shown to work for apple Hypanthium, not all plants are nearly as porous. The alternative to plant cellulose is bacterial cellulose which is typically more pure than plant cellulose as it is free from contaminants such as lignin and hemicellulose. Bacterial cellulose has more hydrogen bonding between its polymer strands and so it has greater crystallinity. It also has smaller microfibrils that allow it to retain more moisture and have smaller pores. The substance can be produced using waste carbohydrates (which may allow it to be produced less expensively) and it adds juiciness and chewiness to emulsified meat (which would mean that even if it can&#x27;t be taken out of the final product, it will contribute to the texture profile).

==== Chitin ====
Chitin is nature&#x27;s second most abundant polymer. It is found in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and fungi. As cellular agriculture is attempting to end reliance on animals, chitin derived from fungi is of greater interest. It has mostly been studied by Pelling Group. Chitosan is derived from chitin in a process known as alkaline deacetylation (substituting out certain amino acid groups). The degree of this process determines the physical and chemical properties of the chitosan. Chitosan has antibacterial properties; in particular, it has bactericidal effects on planktonic bacteria and biofilms and a bacteria static effects on gram negative bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;. This is important as it neutralizes potentially harmful compounds without using antibiotics, which many consumers avoid. Chitosan&#x27;s resemblance to glycosaminoglycans and internal interactions between glycoproteins and proteoglycans make it highly biocompatible. It can easily blend with other polymers in order to select for more bioactive factors. One potential disadvantage of chitosan is that it degrades in the presence of lysozymes (naturally occurring enzymes). But, this can be resisted using deacetylation. This is not entirely negative, as the byproducts produced through degradation have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. It is important to match the level that cells rely on the matrix for structure with degradation.

==== Collagen ====
Collagen is a family of proteins that makes up the primary structure of human connective tissue. It is typically derived from bovine, porcine and murine sources. Cellular agriculture overcomes this dependency through the use of transgenic organisms that are capable of producing the amino acid repeats that make up the collagen. Collagen naturally exists as collagen type I. It has been produced as porous hydrogels, composites and substrates with topographical cues and biochemical properties. Synthetic kinds of collagen have been produced through recombinant protein production—collagen type II and III, tropoelastin and fibronectin. One challenge with these proteins is that they can not be modified post translation. However, an alternative fibrillar protein has been isolated in microbes that lack collagen&#x27;s biochemical cues, but has its kind of gene customizability. One focus of recombinant collagen production is yield optimization—how it can be produced most effectively. Plants, in particular, tobacco look like the best option, however, bacteria and yeast are also viable alternatives.

Textured soy protein is a soy flour product often used in plant-based meat that supports the growth of bovine cells. Its spongy texture enables efficient cell seeding and its porosity encourages oxygen transfer. Additionally, it degrades during cell differentiation into compounds that are beneficial to certain cells.

==== Mycelium ====
Mycelium are the roots of mushrooms. Altast Foods Co. is using solid state fermentation to grow mushroom tissue on mycelium scaffolds. They harvest this tissue and use it to create bacon analogs.

==== Nanomaterials ====
Nanomaterials exhibit unique properties at the nanoscale. London-based Biomimetic Solutions is leveraging nanomaterials in order to create scaffolds. Cass Materials in Perth, Australia, is using a dietary fibre called Nata de Coco (derived from coconuts) to create nanocellulose sponges for their BNC scaffold. Nata de Coco is biocompatible, has high porosity, facilitates cell adhesion and is biodegradable.

==== Spinning ====
Immersion Jet Spinning is a method of creating scaffolds by spinning polymers into fibres. It was developed by the Parker Group at Harvard. Their platform uses centrifugal force to extrude a polymer solution through an opening in a rotating reservoir. During extrusion, the solution forms a jet that elongates and aligns as it crosses the air gap. The jet is directed into a vortex-controlled precipitation bath that chemically cross links or precipitates polymer nanofibers. Adjusting air gap, rotation and the solution changes the diameter of the resulting fibres. This method can spin scaffolds out of PPTA, nylon, DNA and nanofiber sheets. A nanofibrous scaffold made from alginate and gelatin was able to support the growth of C2C12 cells. Rabbit and bovine aortic smooth muscle myoblasts were able to adhere to the gelatin fibres. They formed aggregates on shorter fibres, and aligned tissue on the longer ones. Matrix Meats is using electrospinning—a process that uses electric force to turn charged polymers into fibres for scaffolds. Their scaffolds allowed meat marbling, are compatible with multiple cell lines, and are scalable.

===Additive manufacturing===

Another proposed way of structuring muscle tissue is additive manufacturing. Such a technique was perfected for industrial applications in manufacturing objects made out of plastic, metal, glass and other synthetic materials. The most common variation of the process involves incrementally depositing a filament in layers onto a bed until the object is completed. This method will most likely lend itself best to the application of cultured meat as opposed to other types such as binder jetting, material jetting or stereolithography that require a specific kind of resin or powder.

A filament of muscle cells can be printed into a structure meant to resemble a finished meat product which can then be further processed for cell maturation. This technique has been demonstrated in a collaboration between 3D bioprinting solutions and Aleph Farms that used additive manufacturing to structure turkey cells on the International Space Station. 3D bioprinting has been used to produce steak-like cultured meat, composed of three types of bovine cell fibers and with a structure of assembled of cell fibers that is similar to original meat.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41467-021-25236-9&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioreactors ===
Scaffolds are placed inside bioreactors so that cell growth and specialization can occur. Bioreactors are large machines similar to brewery tanks which expose the cells to a large variety of environmental factors that are necessary to promote either proliferation or differentiation. The temperature of the bioreactor must replicate &quot;in vivo&quot; conditions. In the case of mammalian cells, this requires heating to 37 °C (99 °F). Alternatively, insect cells can be grown at room temperature. Most bioreactors are maintained at 5% carbon dioxide. Cells can be cultivated in either continuous or fed-batch systems. The former entails inoculating and harvesting cells in a constant process so that there are always cells in the bioreactor. Fed-batch systems mean inoculating the cells, culturing them and harvesting them in a single period.

Stirred tank bioreactors are the most widely used configuration. An impeller increases the flow, thereby homogenizing the culture media and a diffuser facilitates the exchange of oxygen into the media. This system is generally used for suspended cultures but can be used for cells that require attachment to another surface if microcarriers are included. Fixed bed bioreactors are commonly used for adherent cultures. They feature strips of fibres that are packed together to form a bed to which cells can attach. Aerated culture media is circulated through the bed. In airlift bioreactors, the culture media is aerated into a gaseous form using air bubbles which are then scattered and dispersed amongst the cells. Perfusion bioreactors are common configurations for continuous cultivation. They continuously drain media saturated with lactic acid that is void of nutrients and fill it with replenished media.

==Challenges==

=== Growth factors ===
The culture media is an essential component of &quot;in vitro&quot; cultivation. It is responsible for providing the macromolecules, nutrients and growth factors necessary for cell proliferation. Sourcing growth factors is one of the most challenging tasks of cellular agriculture. Traditionally, it involves the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) which is a blood product extracted from fetal cows. Besides the argument that its production is unethical, it also violates the notion that the cultured meat is produced independent of the use of animals. It is also the most costly constituent of cultured meat, priced at around $1000 per litre. Furthermore, chemical composition varies greatly depending on the animal, so it cannot be uniformly quantified chemically. FBS is employed because it conveniently mimics the process of muscle development &quot;in vivo&quot;. The growth factors needed for tissue development are predominantly provided through an animal&#x27;s bloodstream, and no other known fluid can single-handedly deliver all these components.

The current alternative is to generate each growth factor individually using recombinant protein production. In this process, the genes coding for the specific factor are integrated into bacteria which are then fermented. Due to the added complexity of this process, it is particularly expensive. Future Fields, a Canadian company focused on overcoming the economic and environmental costs of traditional growth media, is developing serum-free growth factors from fruit flies.

The ideal medium would be chemically quantifiable and accessible to ensure simplicity in production, cheap and not dependent on animals. It will most likely be derived from plants; and while this may reduce the possibility of transmitting infectious agents, it may induce allergic reactions in some consumers. Such culture sera may also require modifications specific to the cell line to which they are applied. Companies currently invested in developing effective plant based culture include Multus Media and Biftek.

The Good Food Institute (GFI) put out a report in 2019 in support of the concept that cell-based &quot;meat&quot; could be produced at the same cost as ground beef and in 2021 they commissioned a report from CE Delft on the Techno-Economic Analysis of cultivated meat. Another proposed approach is to subject the cell lines to a magnetic field, which can stimulate the release of molecules that have regenerative, metabolic, anti-inflammatory and immunity-boosting properties, acting as an alternative to serum.

=== Surface area ===
A common challenge to bioreactors and scaffolds is developing system configurations that enable all cells to gain exposure to culture media while simultaneously optimizing spatial requirements. In the cell proliferation phase, prior to the introduction of the scaffold, many cell types need to be attached to a surface to support growth. As such, cells must be grown in confluent monolayers only one cell thick which necessitates a lot of surface area. This poses practical challenges on large scales. As such, systems may incorporate microcarriers—small spherical beads of glass or other compatible material that are suspended in the culture medium. Cells adhere to these microcarriers as they would to the sides of the bioreactor, which increases the amount of surface area.

In the cell differentiation phase, the cells may be seeded to a scaffold and so do not require the use of microcarriers. However, in these instances, the density of the cells on the scaffold means that not all cells have an interface with culture media, leading to cell death and necrotic centers within the meat. When muscle is cultivated &quot;in vivo&quot;, this issue is circumvented as the extracellular matrix delivers nutrients into the muscle through blood vessels. As such, many emerging scaffolds aim to replicate such networks.

Similarly, scaffolds must simulate many of the other characteristics of the extracellular matrix, most notably porosity, crystallinity, degradation, biocompatibility and functionality. Few materials that emulate all these characteristics have been identified, leading to the possibility of blending different materials with complementary properties.

=== Research support ===
Cellular agriculture research does not have a significant basis of academic interest or funding streams. Consequently, the majority of research has been undertaken and funded by independent institutions. This is incrementally changing as not for profits drive support and interest. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to support graduate students and groups at various academic institutions. Additionally, a growing number of governments are funding research in cellular agriculture. In August 2020, the Grant Management Services of the European Commission awarded a €2.5 million grant to ORF Genetics. That same month, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry granted IntegriCulture $2.2 million through their New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization.

The European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 R&amp;D funding framework awarded a €2.7 million grant to a consortium led by BioTech Foods. In 2021, the Spanish government granted €3.7 million for Biotech Foods to investigate the potential health benefits of cellular agriculture. The National Science Foundation awarded a $3.55 million grant to a team of researchers at UC Davis for open-access cultured meat research. Non-profits also drive support and interest in the field. Notably, New Harvest has a fellowship program to support the research of specific graduate students and groups at various academic institutions and the Good Food Institute funds open-access research through its Research Grant Program.

=== Consumer acceptance ===
Consumer acceptance of the product is critical. A study looking at acceptance of cultured meat in China, India, and the US &quot;found high levels of acceptance of clean meat in the three most populous countries worldwide.&quot; Several potential factors of consumer acceptance of cultured meat have been identified. Healthiness, safety, nutritional characteristics, sustainability, taste, and lower price, are all contributing factors. One study found that the use of highly technical language to explain cultured meat led to significantly more negative public attitude towards the concept. One study suggested that describing cultured meat in a way that emphasizes the final product rather than the production method was an effective way to improve acceptance.

The use of standardized descriptions would improve future research about consumer acceptance of cultured meat. Current studies have often reported drastically different rates of acceptance, despite similar survey populations. Lou Cooperhouse, CEO of BlueNalu, shared on the &quot;Red to Green Podcast&quot; that &quot;cell-based&quot; and &quot;cell-cultured&quot; were suitable terms to differentiate it from conventional meat whilst being clear about the process by which it was made. There also exists a challenge in how to use these descriptions in labelling. For example, in the United States there is no overarching federal legislation that regulates how cultured meat should be labeled for the consumer. While traditional meat producers are attempting to prevent cultured meat companies from using the term &quot;meat,&quot; cultured meat producers argue that the word is necessary for consumer acceptance.

Global market acceptance has not been assessed. Studies are attempting to determine the current levels of consumer acceptance and identify methods to improve this value. Clear answers are not available, although one recent study reported that consumers were willing to pay a premium for cultured meat. Low percentages of older adult populations have been reported to show acceptance for cultured meat. Green eating behavior, educational status, and food business, were cited as most important factors for this population. There is also a lack of studies relating the methods of producing cultured meat with its taste for the consuming public.

=== Regulations ===
Regulatory matters must also be sorted out. Prior to being available for sale, the European Union, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Canada require approved novel food applications. Additionally, the European Union requires that cultured animal products and production must prove safety, by an approved company application, as of 1 January 2018.

====Singapore====
In 2020, Singapore became the first country in the world to approve cultured meat for sale. The Singapore Food Agency has published guidance on its requirements for the safety assessment of novel foods, including specific requirements on the information to be submitted for approval of cultivated meat products.

====Italy====
In March 2023, Italy&#x27;s Meloni government approved a draft bill banning the production and commercialization of cultivated meat for human and animal consumption; this move, which the government said was intended to protect food heritage, was criticized, including by scientists, for being at odds with global trends of openness and legalization, as misguided, and for possibly worsening climate change in Italy. By October 2023, it was reported the Italian government had retired the draft bill, and withdrew the Technical Regulation Information System notification, a procedure aimed at preventing the creation of barriers within the European Union&#x27;s internal market, for the bill. Francesco Lollobrigida, Italy&#x27;s minister of agriculture, said that the withdrawal of the proposed anti-cultured meat bill Italy submitted to the European Union &quot;is not a step back&quot;, which many speculated was because the government wanted to avoid a likely rejection by the European Commission. He added that the bill was not going to be retired and would move forward. Italy became the first country to ban cultured meat in November 2023, when the government approved the bill.

====US====
In September 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) have agreed to jointly regulate cultured meat. Under the agreement, the FDA oversees cell collection, cell banks, and cell growth and differentiation, while the USDA oversees the production and labeling of food products derived from the cells that are meant for human consumption.

Several U.S. states, such as Missouri, South Carolina, Texas, and Washington, have passed legislation limiting the use of the term &quot;meat&quot; on cultured meat packaging.

Full bans on cultured meat have been enacted in Florida and Alabama: in Florida the law makes it a criminal offense to manufacture and sell, and in Alabama cultured meat has been illegal to manufacture, sell, or distribute since October 2024. The governments of Arizona, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia are considering similar laws.

In August 2024, Upside Foods sued Florida in an attempt to strike down their law.

==Differences from conventional meat==
===Health===
Large-scale production of cultured meat may or may not require artificial growth hormones to be added to the culture for meat production. As cultured meat is grown in a sterile environment, there is no need for antibiotics. Today, the widespread use of antibiotics in conventional agriculture is the main driver of antibiotic resistance in humans. According to the World Health Organization, antimicrobial resistance represents &quot;an increasingly serious threat to global public health that requires action across all government sectors and society&quot; – predicting up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. Cultured meat could provide an effective solution to help mitigate this major risk to human health.

Researchers have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids could be added to cultured meat as a health bonus. In a similar way, the omega-3 fatty acid content of conventional meat can be increased by altering what the animals are fed. Research is currently underway in Spain to develop cultivated meat with healthier fats, which could reduce cholesterol and the risk of colon cancer typically associated with red meat consumption. An issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine suggested that the cell-cultured process may also decrease exposure of the meat to bacteria and disease.

Due to the strictly controlled and predictable environment, cultured meat production has been compared to vertical farming. Some of its proponents have predicted that it will have similar benefits in terms of reducing exposure to dangerous chemicals like pesticides and fungicides, severe injuries, and wildlife. There is also a lack of research on the comparison on the health effects of production cultured meat with the industrial meat or the biologic organic meat ways of production.

===Artificiality===
Although cultured meat consists of animal muscle cells, fat and support cells, as well as blood vessels, that are the same as in traditional meat, some consumers may find the high-tech production process unacceptable. Cultured meat has been described as fake or &quot;Frankenmeat&quot;. On the other hand, cultured meat can be produced without the artificial hormones, antibiotics, steroids, medicine, and GMOs commonly used in factory farmed meat and seafood, though not used on organic biologic production. If a cultured meat product is different in appearance, taste, smell, texture, or other factors, it may not be commercially competitive with conventionally produced meat. The lack of bone and cardiovascular system is a disadvantage for dishes where these parts make appreciable culinary contributions. The lack of bones and/or blood may make many traditional meat preparations, such as buffalo wings, more palatable to some people. Furthermore, blood and bones could potentially be cultured in the future.

===Environment===

Animal production for food is a major cause of air/water pollution and carbon emissions. Significant questions have been raised about whether the traditional industry can meet the rapidly increasing demands for meat. Cultured meat may provide an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional meat production. The environmental impacts of cultured meat are expected to be significantly lower than from animal husbandry. For every hectare that is used for vertical farming and/or cultured meat manufacturing, anywhere between 10 and 20 hectares of land may be returned to its natural state. Vertical farms (in addition to cultured meat facilities) could exploit methane digesters to generate a portion of its electrical needs. Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the facility into biogas which is generally composed of 65% methane. This biogas could be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse or a series of bioreactors.

One study reported that cultured meat was &quot;potentially ... much more efficient and environmentally-friendly&quot;. It generated only 4% of greenhouse gas emissions, reduced the energy needs of meat production by up to 45%, and required only 2% of the land that the global meat/livestock industry does. In Tuomisto&#x27;s life cycle analysis claimed that producing 1,000 kg of meat conventionally requires &quot;26–33 GJ energy, 367–521 m3 water, 190–230 m2 land, and emits 1900–2240 kg CO2-eq GHG emissions&quot;. On the other hand, producing the same quantity of meat &quot;in vitro&quot; has &quot;7–45% lower energy use... 78–96% lower GHG emissions, 99% lower land use, and 82–96% lower water use&quot;.

The latest study by independent research firm CE Delft shows that—compared with conventional beef—cultured meat may cause up to 92% less greenhouse gas emissions if renewable energy is used in the production process, 93% less pollution, up to 95% less land use and 78% less water. There are many environmental concerns about intensive poultry farming that too can be reduced by cultivating their meat instead of farming animals. These concerns include microorganism and pharmaceutical-containing manure entering the water and soil, emission of greenhouse gasses such as nitrous oxide and methane, and the volatilization of manure particles.

Skeptic Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists speculates that the energy and fossil fuel requirements of large-scale cultured meat production may be more environmentally destructive than producing food off the land. S. L. Davis speculated that both vertical farming in urban areas and the activity of cultured meat facilities may cause relatively little harm to the wildlife that live around the facilities. Dickson Despommier speculated that natural resources may be spared from depletion due to vertical farming and cultured meat. One study reported that conventional farming kills ten wild animals per hectare each year.

===Role of genetic modification===
Techniques of genetic engineering, such as insertion, deletion, silencing, activation, or mutation of a gene, are not required to produce cultured meat. Cultured meat production allows the biological processes that normally occur within an animal to occur without the animal. Since cultured meat is grown in a controlled, artificial environment, some have commented that cultured meat more closely resembles hydroponic vegetables, rather than genetically modified vegetables.

More research is underway on cultured meat, and although cultured meat does not require genetic engineering, researchers may employ such techniques to improve quality and sustainability. Fortifying cultured meat with nutrients such as beneficial fatty acids is one improvement that can be facilitated through genetic modification. The same improvement can be made without genetic modification, by manipulating the conditions of the culture medium. Genetic modification may be able to enhance muscle cell proliferation. The introduction of myogenic regulatory factors, growth factors, or other gene products into muscle cells may increase production over that of conventional meat.

To avoid the use of any animal products, the use of photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria has been proposed to produce the main ingredients for the culture media, as opposed to fetal bovine or horse serum. Some researchers propose that the ability of algae and cyanobacteria to produce ingredients for culture media can be improved with certain technologies, most likely not excluding genetic engineering.

===Ethical===
Australian bioethicist Julian Savulescu said, &quot;Artificial meat stops cruelty to animals, is better for the environment, could be safer and more efficient, and even healthier. We have a moral obligation to support this kind of research. It gets the ethical two thumbs up.&quot; Animal welfare groups are generally in favor of cultured meat, because the culture process does not include a nervous system and therefore does not involve pain or infringement of rights. Reactions of vegetarians to cultured meat vary. Some feel the cultured meat presented to the public in August 2013 was not vegetarian because fetal bovine serum was used in the growth medium. However, since then, cultured meat has been grown with a medium that does not involve bovine serum. Philosopher Carlo Alvaro argues that the question of the morality of eating &quot;in vitro&quot; meat has been discussed only in terms of convenience. Alvaro proposes a virtue-oriented approach, suggesting that the determination to produce cultured meat stems from unvirtuous motives, i.e., &quot;lack of temperance and misunderstanding of the role of food in human flourishing.&quot;

Some have proposed independent inquiries into the standards, laws, and regulations for cultured meat. Just as with many other foods, cultured meat needs technically sophisticated production methods that may be difficult for some communities, meaning they would lack self-sufficiency and be dependent on global food corporations. Some projects are focusing on making cellular agriculture accessible to all. The Shojinmeat Project, for instance, has a bottom-up approach, teaching participants to cultivate DIY cultured meat at home.

Establishing a similar parallel with cultured meat, some environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. Environmentalist Dave Riley states that &quot;being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us&quot;, and writes that Mollison &quot;insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost&quot;.

=== Religious considerations ===
Jewish rabbinical authorities disagree whether cultured meat is kosher, meaning acceptable under Jewish law and practice. One factor is the nature of the animal from which the cells are sourced, whether it is a kosher or non-kosher species and whether, if the cells were taken from a dead animal, slaughter in accordance with religious practice had taken place prior to the extraction of cells. Most authorities agree that if the original cells were taken from a religiously slaughtered animal then the meat cultured from it will be kosher. Depending on the nature of the cells, it may be determined to be kosher even when taken from a live animal, and some have argued that it would be kosher even if coming from non-kosher animals such as pigs. In 2023 the issue of lab meat being a non-meat product or &quot;pareve&quot; has come up for debate. In 2023 the Chief Rabbi of Israel ruled that some types of cultured meat are kosher, and if not made to resemble meat, can have pareve status.

Islamic dietary practices must also be considered. The Islamic Institute of Orange County, California, said, &quot;There does not appear to be any objection to eating this type of cultured meat.&quot; In addition, Abdul Qahir Qamar of the International Islamic Fiqh Academy said that cultured meat &quot;will not be considered meat from live animals, but will be cultured meat.&quot; As long as the cells are not from pigs, dogs, and other haram animals, the meat would be considered vegetative and &quot;similar to yogurt and fermented pickles.&quot;

Catholicism, which excludes eating meat in certain days along the year (Lent, Holy Week), has not pronounced on whether cultivated meat is banned (as it happens with meat) or not (as with any other food as vegetables or fish). Hinduism typically excludes the consumption of beef, such as steak and burgers. Chandra Kaushik, president of the Hindu Mahasabha, said about cultured beef that he would &quot;not accept it being traded in a marketplace in any form or being used for a commercial purpose.&quot;

=== Economic ===
Cultured meat is significantly more costly than conventional meat. In a March 2015 interview, Post said that the marginal cost of his team&#x27;s original €250,000 burger was now €8.00. He estimated that technological advancements would allow the product to be cost-competitive to traditionally sourced beef in approximately ten years. In 2018, Memphis Meats reduced the cost of production to $1,700 per pound. In 2019, Eat Just said it cost about US$50 to produce one chicken nugget. The company&#x27;s cultured chicken nuggets, now available at Singapore restaurant 1880, retail around US$17 as part of a set meal; however, this retail price is below cost. As of 2021, most companies report a production cost of $100 or more per meal-sized serving. A 2019 study estimated that, with current technology, the actual production cost of cultured meat was over $400,000 per kilogram. A 2022 study estimated that, if dramatic advances drove medium costs down to $3.74 per liter, large-scale production costs might optimistically fall to $63 per kilogram over the next few years. The main drivers of cost would be growth medium (accounting for $19.7/kg), labor ($17.7/kg), and bioreactor repairs ($5.47/kg). Competing with wholesale beef ($6/kg) would require reducing all three of these costs.

=== Farmers ===
A scientific paper published in &quot;Front. Sustain. Food Syst.&quot; addresses the social and economic opportunities and challenges of cultured and plant-based meat for rural producers. According to this research, cellular agriculture offers &quot;opportunities such as growing crops as ingredients for feedstock for cultured meat; raising animals for genetic material for cultured meat; producing cultured meat in bioreactors at the farm level; transitioning into new sectors; new market opportunities for blended and hybrid animal- and alt-meat products; and new value around regenerative or high-animal welfare farming.&quot; Some challenges are also identified, with possible &quot;loss of livelihood or income for ranchers and livestock producers and for farmers growing crops for animal feed; barriers to transitioning into emerging alt-meat sectors; and the possibility of exclusion from those sectors.&quot; 
Some farmers already see the potential of cellular agriculture. For instance, Illtud Dunsford comes from a long line of farmers in Wales and established his cultured meat company Cellular Agriculture Ltd in 2016.

== Continuing development ==

=== Education ===
In 2015, Maastricht University hosted the first International Conference on Cultured Meat. New Harvest—a 501(c)(3) research institute—as well as The Good Food Institute host annual conferences to convene industry leaders, scientists, investors, and potential collaborators. The two organizations also fund public research and produce educational content. Organizations such as the Cellular Agriculture Society and similar organizations in Canada, France, Australia, and New Zealand were founded to advocate for cultured meat in their respective countries. Publications such as Cell Agri and Protein Report have also provided updates concerning technology and business within the field.

=== Research ===
Research continues on many fronts, including entomoculture, interactome maps of cardiac tissue, substrate design, scaffold design, nutritional profile, reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, mass transfer limitations and metabolic stoichiometric requirements, and bioprinting process.

=== Accelerators and incubators ===
Multiple venture capital firms and accelerator/incubator programs focus on assisting cultured technology startups, or plant-based protein companies in general. The Big Idea Ventures (BIV) Venture Capital firm launched their New Protein Fund to invest in emerging cell and plant-based food companies in New York and Singapore. They invested in MeliBio, Actual Veggies, Biftek.co, Orbillion Bio, Yoconut, Evo, WildFor and Novel Farms. Indie Bio is a biology oriented accelerator program that has invested in Memphis Meats, Geltor, New Age Meats and Finless Foods.

== In popular culture ==

Cultured meat has often featured in science fiction. The earliest mention may be in &quot;Two Planets&quot; (1897) by Kurd Lasswitz, where &quot;synthetic meat&quot; is one of the varieties of synthetic food introduced on Earth by Martians. Other notable books mentioning artificial meat include &quot;Methuselah&#x27;s Children&quot; (1941) by Robert A. Heinlein; &quot;Ashes, Ashes&quot; (1943) by René Barjavel; &quot;The Space Merchants&quot; (1952) by Frederik Pohl and C.M. Kornbluth; &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot; (1980) by Douglas Adams; &quot;Le Transperceneige (Snowpiercer)&quot; (1982) by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette; &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (1984) by William Gibson; &quot;Oryx and Crake&quot; (2003) by Margaret Atwood; &quot;Deadstock&quot; (2007) by Jeffrey Thomas; &quot;Accelerando&quot; (2005) by Charles Stross; &quot;Ware Tetralogy&quot; by Rudy Rucker; &quot;Divergent&quot; (2011) by Veronica Roth; and the Vorkosigan Saga (1986–2018) by Lois McMaster Bujold.

In film, artificial meat has featured prominently in Giulio Questi&#x27;s 1968 drama &quot;La morte ha fatto l&#x27;uovo&quot; (&quot;Death Laid an Egg&quot;) and Claude Zidi&#x27;s 1976 comedy &quot;L&#x27;aile ou la cuisse&quot; (&quot;The Wing or the Thigh&quot;). &quot;Man-made&quot; chickens also appear in David Lynch&#x27;s 1977 surrealist horror, &quot;Eraserhead&quot;. Most recently, it was also featured prominently as the central theme of the movie &quot;Antiviral&quot; (2012). The Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; from the TV and movie franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot; apparently provides a synthetic meat, although crews from &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and later use replicators. In the ABC sitcom &quot;Better Off Ted&quot; (2009–2010), the episode &quot;Heroes&quot; features Phil (Jonathan Slavin) and Lem (Malcolm Barrett) trying to grow cowless beef.

In the movie &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; during the dinner scene, Tim Allen&#x27;s character refers to his steak tasting like &quot;real Iowa beef&quot;. In the videogame &quot;Project Eden&quot;, the player characters investigate a cultured meat company called Real Meat. In &quot;The Expanse&quot;, &quot;vat-grown&quot; meat is produced to feed the people who live on spaceships/space stations away from Earth, due to the exorbitant cost of importing real meat. Cultured meat was a subject on an episode of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on 17 March 2009.

In February 2014, a biotech startup called BiteLabs ran a campaign to generate popular support for artisanal salami made with meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples. The campaign became popular on Twitter, where users tweeted at celebrities asking them to donate muscle cells to the project. Media reactions to BiteLabs variously identified the startup as a satire on startup culture, celebrity culture, or as a discussion prompt on bioethical concerns. While BiteLabs claimed to be inspired by the success of Sergey Brin&#x27;s burger, the company is seen as an example of critical design rather than an actual business venture.

In late 2016, cultured meat was involved in a case in the episode &quot;How The Sausage Is Made&quot; of CBS show &quot;Elementary&quot;. Cultured meat was profiled in the 2020 Canadian documentary film &quot;Meat the Future&quot;. In the 2020 video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, multiple cultured meat products are for sale, due to the high cost of natural meat. This includes &quot;EEZYBEEF&quot;, made from &quot;in vitro&quot; cultured muscle cells taken from cattle, and the flatworm culture based &quot;Orgiatic&quot; which comes in several flavors.

== Related processes ==
=== Fermentation ===
Acellular agriculture is producing animal products synthesized from non-living material. Such products include milk, honey, eggs, cheese, and gelatin which are made of various proteins rather than cells. These proteins must be fermented much like in recombinant protein production, alcohol brewing and the generation of many plant-based products like tofu, tempeh and sauerkraut.

Proteins are coded for by specific genes, the genes coding for the protein of interest are synthesized into a plasmid—a closed loop of double helical genetic information. This plasmid, called recombinant DNA, is then inserted into a bacterial specimen. For this to happen, the bacteria needs to be competent (i.e. able to accept foreign, extracellular DNA) and able to horizontally transfer genes (i.e. integrate the foreign genes into its own DNA). Horizontal gene transfer is significantly more challenging in eukaryotic organisms than prokaryotic organisms because the former have both a cell membrane and a nuclear membrane which the plasmid needs to penetrate whereas prokaryotic organisms only have a cell membrane. For this reason, prokaryotic bacteria are often favoured. In order to make such a bacteria temporarily competent, it can be exposed to a salt such as calcium chloride, which neutralizes the negative charges on the cell membrane&#x27;s phosphate heads as well as the negative charges on the plasmid to prevent the two from repelling. The bacteria can incubate in warm water, opening large pores on the cell surface through which the plasmid can enter.

Next, the bacteria is fermented in sugar, which encourages it to grow and duplicate. In the process it expresses its DNA as well as the transferred plasmid resulting in protein. Finally, the solution is purified to separate out the residual protein. This can be done by introducing an antibody raised against the protein of interest that will kill bacteria cells that do not contain the protein. Through centrifugation, the solution can be spun around an axis with sufficient force to separate solids from liquids. Alternatively it could be soaked in a buffered ionic solution that employs osmosis to leach the water from bacteria and kill them.

<doc id="511629" wikidata="Q2365406" url="?curid=511629" title="History of Latin America">
<text>The term &quot;Latin America&quot; originated in the 1830s, primarily through Michel Chevalier, who proposed the region could ally with &quot;Latin Europe&quot; against other European cultures. It primarily refers to the Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in the New World.

Before the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, the region was home to many indigenous peoples, including advanced civilizations, most notably from South: the Olmec, Maya, Muisca, Aztecs and Inca. The region came under control of the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal, which established colonies, and imposed Roman Catholicism and their languages. Both brought African slaves to their colonies as laborers, exploiting large, settled societies and their resources. The Spanish Crown regulated immigration, allowing only Christians to travel to the New World. The colonization process led to significant native population declines due to disease, forced labor, and violence. They imposed their culture, destroying native codices and artwork. Colonial-era religion played a crucial role in everyday life, with the Spanish Crown ensuring religious purity and aggressively prosecuting perceived deviations like witchcraft.

In the early nineteenth century nearly all of areas of Spanish America attained independence by armed struggle, with the exceptions of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Brazil, which had become a monarchy separate from Portugal, became a republic in the late nineteenth century. Political independence from European monarchies did not result in the abolition of black slavery in the new nations, it resulted in political and economic instability in Spanish America, immediately after independence. Great Britain and the United States exercised significant influence in the post-independence era, resulting in a form of neo-colonialism, where political sovereignty remained in place, but foreign powers exercised considerable power in the economic sphere. Newly independent nations faced domestic and interstate conflicts, struggling with economic instability and social inequality.

The 20th century brought U.S. intervention and the Cold War&#x27;s impact on the region, with revolutions in countries like Cuba influencing Latin American politics. The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw shifts towards left-wing governments, followed by conservative resurgences, and a recent resurgence of left-wing politics in several countries.

==Origin of the term and definition==
The idea that a part of the Americas has a cultural or racial affinity with all Romance cultures can be traced back to the 1830s, in particular in the writing of the French Saint-Simonian Michel Chevalier, who postulated that this part of the Americas were inhabited by people of a &quot;Latin race,&quot; and that it could, therefore, ally itself with &quot;Latin Europe&quot; in a struggle with &quot;Teutonic Europe,&quot; &quot;Anglo-Saxon America&quot; and &quot;Slavic Europe.&quot; The idea was later taken up by Latin American intellectuals and political leaders of the mid- and late-nineteenth century, who no longer looked to Spain or Portugal as cultural models, but rather to France. The actual term &quot;Latin America&quot; was coined in France under Napoleon III and played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area and install Maximilian as emperor of Mexico.

In the mid-twentieth century, especially in the United States, there was a trend to occasionally classify all of the territory south of the United States as &quot;Latin America,&quot; especially when the discussion focused on its contemporary political and economic relations to the rest of the world, rather than solely on its cultural aspects. Concurrently, there has been a move to avoid this oversimplification by talking about &quot;Latin America and the Caribbean,&quot; as in the United Nations geoscheme.

Since, the concept and definitions of Latin American are very modern, going back only to the nineteenth century, it is anachronistic to talk about &quot;a history of Latin America&quot; before the arrival of the Europeans. Nevertheless, the many and varied cultures that did exist in the pre-Columbian period had a strong and direct influence on the societies that emerged as a result of the conquest, and therefore, they cannot be overlooked. They are introduced in the next section.

==The Pre-Columbian period==

What is now Latin America has been populated for millennia, possibly as long as 30,000 years. There are many models of the peopling of the Americas. Precise dating of early civilizations is difficult because there are few text sources. However, highly developed civilizations flourished at various places, such as in the Andes and Mesoamerica.

The earliest known human settlement in the area was identified at Monte Verde in southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the North and South America and the Caribbean islands. Although the region now known as Latin America stretches from northern Mexico to Tierra del Fuego, the diversity of its geography, topography, climate, and cultivable land means that populations were not evenly distributed. Sedentary populations of fixed settlements supported by agriculture gave rise to complex civilizations in Mesoamerica (central and southern Mexico and Central America) and the highland Andes populations of Quechua and Aymara, as well as Chibcha.

Agricultural surpluses from intensive cultivation of maize in Mesoamerica and potatoes and hardy grains in the Andes were able to support distant populations beyond farmers&#x27; households and communities. Surpluses allowed the creation of social, political, religious, and military hierarchies, urbanization with stable village settlements and major cities, specialization of craft work, and the transfer of products via tribute and trade. In the Andes, llamas were domesticated and used to transport goods; Mesoamerica had no large domesticated animals to aid human labor or provide meat. Mesoamerican civilizations developed systems of writing; in the Andes, knotted quipus emerged as a system of accounting.

The Caribbean region had sedentary populations settled by Arawak or Tainos and in what is now Brazil, many Tupian peoples lived in fixed settlements. Semi-sedentary populations had agriculture and settled villages, but soil exhaustion required relocation of settlements. Populations were less dense and social and political hierarchies less institutionalized. Non-sedentary peoples lived in small bands, with low population density and without agriculture. They lived in harsh environments. By the first millennium CE, the Western Hemisphere was the home of tens of millions of people; the exact numbers are a source of ongoing research and controversy.

The last two great civilizations, the Aztecs and Incas, emerged into prominence in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries. Although the Indigenous empires were conquered by Europeans, the sub-imperial organization of the densely populated regions remained in place. The presence or absence of Indigenous populations had an impact on how European imperialism played out in the Americas. The pre-Columbian civilizations of Mesoamerica and the highland Andes became sources of pride for American-born Spaniards in the late colonial era and for nationalists in the post-independence era. For some modern Latin American nation-states, the Indigenous roots of national identity are expressed in the ideology of &quot;indigenismo&quot;. These modern constructions of national identity usually critique their colonial past.

=== Sport in Pre-Columbian Period ===
As a result of imperialism and colonialism, historians note the diffusion of sports that brought football, baseball, boxing, cricket, and basketball from the empires to its colonies. In the context of Latin America, historians can acknowledge the power imbalances between the colonial elite and those of poorer circumstance by looking at sport history. For instance, dating back to the pre-columbian Mesoamerica, horsemanship contests were an integral part of leisure activity for the individuals of the colonies. However, many colonial official took advantage of their power over the poor people&#x27;s accessibility to the game by preventing the poorer individuals from accessing the horses. This attempt to control and manipulate the people of the colony failed as many of the indigenous people needed the horses for labor– labor that would serve to benefit the upper class who exploit the colony.

Furthermore, horses played an important role in the early day of Latin American sport. Such examples include the horsemanship contests mentioned above, the charreada of Mexico, other equestrian activities in the region that would eventually be Argentina and Uruguay, etc. These sport gave the indigenous people the opportunity to practice values of talent, honor, and teamwork. It also was accessible to the poorer indigenous individuals of the colony because horses were affordable and not relatively expensive to the people of a lower class than those colonial elite.

==Colonial Era==
Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the New World to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. Spain concentrated on building its empire on the central and southern parts of the Americas allotted to it by the Treaty of Tordesillas, because of presence of large, settled societies like the Aztec, the Inca, the Maya and the Muisca, whose human and material resources it could exploit, and large concentrations of silver and gold. The Portuguese built their empire in Brazil, which fell in their sphere of influence owing to the Treaty of Tordesillas, by developing the land for sugar production since there was a lack of a large, complex society or mineral resources.

During the European colonization of the western hemisphere, most of the native population died, mainly by disease. In what has come to be known as the Columbian exchange, diseases such as smallpox and measles decimated populations with no immunity. The size of the indigenous populations has been studied in the modern era by historians, but Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas raised the alarm in the earliest days of Spanish settlement in the Caribbean in his &quot;A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies&quot;.

The conquerors and colonists of Latin America also had a major impact on the population of Latin America. The Spanish conquistadors committed savage acts of violence against the natives. According to Bartolomé de las Casas, the Europeans worked the native population to death, separated the men and the women so they could not reproduce, and hunted down and killed any natives who escaped with dogs. Las Casas claimed that the Spaniards made the natives work day and night in mines and would &quot;test the sharpness of their blades&quot; on the natives. Las Casas estimated that around three million natives died from war, slavery, and overworking. When talking about the cruelty, Las Casas said &quot;Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it.&quot;

Because the Spanish were now in power, native culture and religion were forbidden. The Spanish even went as far as burning the Maya Codices (like books). These codices contained information about astrology, religion, Gods, and rituals. There are four codices known to exist today; these are the Dresden Codex, Paris Codex, Madrid Codex, and HI Codex. The Spanish also melted down countless pieces of golden artwork so they could bring the gold back to Spain and destroyed countless pieces of art.

=== Colonial-era religion ===
; Traveling to the New World
The Spanish Crown regulated immigration to its overseas colonies, with travelers required to register with the House of Trade in Seville. Since the crown wished to exclude anyone who was non-Christian (Jews, crypto-Jews, and Muslims) passing as Christian, travelers&#x27; backgrounds were vetted. The ability to regulate the flow of people enabled the Spanish Crown to keep a grip on the religious purity of its overseas empire. The Spanish Crown was rigorous in their attempt to allow only Christians passage to the New World and required proof of religion by way of personal testimonies. Specific examples of individuals dealing with the Crown allow for an understanding of how religion affected passage into the New World.

Francisca de Figueroa, an African-Iberian woman seeking entrance into the Americas, petitioned the Spanish Crown in 1600 in order to gain a license to sail to Cartagena. On her behalf she had a witness attest to her religious purity, Elvira de Medina wrote, &quot;this witness knows that she and parents and her grandparents have been and are Old Christians and of unsullied cast and lineage. They are not of Moorish or Jewish caste or of those recently converted to Our Holy Catholic Faith.&quot; Despite Francisca&#x27;s race, she was allowed entrance into the Americas in 1601 when a &#x27;Decree from His Majesty&#x27; was presented, it read, &quot;My presidents and official judges of the Case de Contraction of Seville. I order you to allow passage to the Province of Cartagena for Francisca de Figueroa ...&quot; This example points to the importance of religion, when attempting to travel to the Americas during colonial times. Individuals had to work within the guidelines of Christianity in order to appeal to the Crown and be granted access to travel.

; Religion in Latin America
Once in the New World, religion was still a prevalent issue which had to be considered in everyday life. Many of the laws were based on religious beliefs and traditions and often these laws clashed with the many other cultures throughout colonial Latin America. One of the central clashes was between African and Iberian cultures; this difference in culture resulted in the aggressive prosecution of witches, both African and Iberian, throughout Latin America. According to European tradition &quot;[a] witch – a bruja – was thought to reject God and the sacraments and instead worship the devil and observe the witches&#x27; Sabbath.&quot; This rejection of God was seen as an abomination and was not tolerated by the authorities either in Spain nor Latin America. A specific example, the trial of Paula de Eguiluz, shows how an appeal to Christianity can help to lessen punishment even in the case of a witch trial.

Paula de Eguiluz was a woman of African descent who was born in Santo Domingo and grew up as a slave, sometime in her youth she learned the trade of witches and was publicly known to be a sorceress. &quot;In 1623, Paula was accused of witchcraft (brujeria), divination and apostasy (declarations contrary to Church doctrine).&quot; Paula was tried in 1624 and began her hearings without much knowledge of the Crowns way of conducting legal proceedings. There needed to be appeals to Christianity and announcements of faith if an individual hoped to lessen the sentence. Learning quickly, Paula correctly &quot;recited the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Creed, the Salve Regina, and the Ten Commandments&quot; before the second hearing of her trial. Finally, in the third hearing of the trial Paula ended her testimony by &quot;ask[ing] Our Lord to forgive [me] for these dreadful sins and errors and requests ... a merciful punishment.&quot; The appeals to Christianity and profession of faith allowed Paula to return to her previous life as a slave with minimal punishment. The Spanish Crown placed a high importance on the preservation of Christianity in Latin America.

==Nineteenth-century revolutions: the postcolonial era==
Following the model of the American and French revolutions, most of Latin America achieved its independence by 1825. Independence destroyed the old common market that existed under the Spanish Empire after the Bourbon Reforms and created an increased dependence on the financial investment provided by nations, which had already begun to industrialize; therefore, Western European powers, in particular Great Britain and France, and the United States began to play major roles, since the region became economically dependent on these nations. Independence also created a new, self-consciously &quot;Latin American&quot; ruling class and intelligentsia, which at times avoided Spanish and Portuguese models in their quest to reshape their societies. This elite looked towards other Catholic European models—in particular France—for a new Latin American culture, but did not seek input from indigenous peoples.

The failed efforts in Spanish America to keep together most of the initial large states that emerged from independence— Gran Colombia, the Federal Republic of Central America and the United Provinces of South America—resulted a number of domestic and interstate conflicts, which plagued the new countries. Brazil, in contrast to its Hispanic neighbors, remained a united monarchy and avoided the problem of civil and interstate wars. Domestic wars were often fights between federalists and centrists, who ended up asserting themselves through the military repression of their opponents at the expense of civilian political life. The new nations inherited the cultural diversity of the colonial era and strived to create a new identity based around the shared European (Spanish or Portuguese) language and culture. Within each country, however, there were cultural and class divisions that created tension and hurt national unity.

For the next few decades there was a long process to create a sense of nationality. Most of the new national borders were created around the often centuries-old audiencia jurisdictions or the Bourbon intendancies, which had become areas of political identity. In many areas the borders were unstable, since the new states fought wars with each other to gain access to resources, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century. The more important conflicts were the Paraguayan War (1864–70; also known as the War of the Triple Alliance) and the War of the Pacific (1879–84). The Paraguayan War pitted Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay against Paraguay, which was utterly defeated. As a result, Paraguay suffered a demographic collapse: the population went from an estimated 525,000 persons in 1864 to 221,000 in 1871 and out of this last population, only around 28,000 were men. In the War of the Pacific, Chile defeated the combined forces of Bolivia and Peru. Chile gained control of saltpeter-rich areas, previously controlled by Peru and Bolivia, and Bolivia became a land-locked nation. By mid-century the region also confronted a growing United States, seeking to expand on the North American continent and extend its influence in the hemisphere. In Mexican–American War (1846–48), Mexico lost over half of its territory to the United States. In the 1860s France attempted to indirectly control Mexico. In South America, Brazil consolidated its control of large swaths of the Amazon Basin at the expense of its neighbors. In the 1880s the United States implemented an aggressive policy to defend and expand its political and economic interests in all of Latin America, which culminated in the creation of the Pan-American Conference, the successful completion of the Panama Canal and the United States intervention in the final Cuban war of independence.

The export of natural resources provided the basis of most Latin American economies in the nineteenth century, which allowed for the development of wealthy elite. The restructuring of colonial economic and political realities resulted in a sizable gap between rich and poor, with landed elites controlling the vast majority of land and resources. In Brazil, for instance, by 1910 85% of the land belonged to 1% of the population. Gold mining and fruit growing, in particular, were monopolized by these wealthy landowners. These &quot;Great Owners&quot; completely controlled local activity and, furthermore, were the principal employers and the main source of wages. This led to a society of peasants whose connection to larger political realities remained in thrall to farming and mining magnates.

The endemic political instability and the nature of the economy resulted in the emergence of caudillos, military chiefs whose hold on power depended on their military skill and ability to dispense patronage. The political regimes were at least in theory democratic and took the form of either presidential or parliamentary governments. Both were prone to being taken over by a caudillo or an oligarchy. The political landscape was occupied by conservatives, who believed that the preservation of the old social hierarchies served as the best guarantee of national stability and prosperity, and liberals, who sought to bring about progress by freeing up the economy and individual initiative. Popular insurrections were often influential and repressed: 100,000 were killed during the suppression of a Colombian revolt between 1899 and 1902 during the Thousand Days&#x27; War. Some states did manage to have some of democracy: Uruguay, and partially Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Colombia. The others were clearly oligarchist or authoritarian, although these oligarchs and caudillos sometimes enjoyed support from a majority in the population. All of these regimes sought to maintain Latin America&#x27;s lucrative position in the world economy as a provider of raw materials.

==20th century==
===1900–1929===

By the start of the century, the United States continued its interventionist attitude, which aimed to directly defend its interests in the region. This was officially articulated in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Big Stick Doctrine, which modified the old Monroe Doctrine, which had simply aimed to deter European intervention in the hemisphere. At the conclusion of the Spanish–American War the new government of Cuba and the United States signed the Platt Amendment in 1902, which authorized the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs when the United States deemed necessary. In Colombia, United States sought the concession of a territory in Panama to build a much anticipated canal across the isthmus. The Colombian government opposed this, but a Panamanian insurrection provided the United States with an opportunity. The United States backed Panamanian independence and the new nation granted the concession. These were not the only interventions carried out in the region by the United States. In the first decades of the twentieth century, there were several military incursions into Central America and the Caribbean, mostly in defense of commercial interests, which became known as the &quot;Banana Wars.&quot;

The greatest political upheaval in the second decade of the century took place in Mexico. In 1908, President Porfirio Díaz, who had been in office since 1884, promised that he would step down in 1910. Francisco I. Madero, a moderate liberal whose aim was to modernize the country while preventing a socialist revolution, launched an election campaign in 1910. Díaz, however, changed his mind and ran for office once more. Madero was arrested on election day and Díaz declared the winner. These events provoked uprisings, which became the start of the Mexican Revolution. Revolutionary movements were organized and some key leaders appeared: Pancho Villa in the north, Emiliano Zapata in the south, and Madero in Mexico City. Madero&#x27;s forces defeated the federal army in early 1911, assumed temporary control of the government and won a second election later on November 6, 1911. Madero undertook moderate reforms to implement greater democracy in the political system but failed to satisfy many of the regional leaders in what had become a revolutionary situation. Madero&#x27;s failure to address agrarian claims led Zapata to break with Madero and resume the revolution. On February 18, 1913 Victoriano Huerta, a conservative general organized a coup d&#x27;état with the support of the United States; Madero was killed four days later. Other revolutionary leaders such as Villa, Zapata, and Venustiano Carranza continued to militarily oppose the federal government, now under Huerta&#x27;s control. Allies Zapata and Villa took Mexico City in March 1914, but found themselves outside of their elements in the capital and withdrew to their respective bastions. This allowed Carranza to assume control of the central government. He then organized the repression of the rebel armies of Villa and Zapata, led in particular by General Álvaro Obregón. The Mexican Constitution of 1917, still the current constitution, was proclaimed but initially little enforced. The efforts against the other revolutionary leaders continued. Zapata was assassinated on April 10, 1919. Carranza himself was assassinated on May 15, 1920, leaving Obregón in power, who was officially elected president later that year. Finally in 1923 Villa was also assassinated. With the removal of the main rivals Obregón is able to consolidate power and relative peace returned to Mexico. Under the Constitution a liberal government is implemented but some of the aspirations of the working and rural classes remained unfulfilled. (See also, Agrarian land reform in Mexico.)

The prestige of Germany and German culture in Latin America remained high after the war but did not recover to its pre-war levels. Indeed, in Chile the war bought an end to a period of scientific and cultural influence writer Eduardo de la Barra scorningly called &quot;the German bewichment&quot; ().

====Sports====
Sports became increasingly popular, drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadia. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation. Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In Brazil, however, sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought to control of international sport. The 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes. English and Scottish engineers brought futebol (soccer) to Brazil in the late 1800s. The International Committee of the YMCA of North America and the Playground Association of America played major roles in training coaches. .

===1930–1945===
The Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialization. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the Roosevelt administration (1933–1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a Good Neighbor policy and allowed the nationalization of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President Lázaro Cárdenas nationalized American oil companies, out of which he created Pemex. Cárdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together.

===Cold War era (1945–1992)===

Many Latin American economies continued to grow in the post-World War II era, but not as quickly as they had hoped. When the transatlantic trade re-opened following the peace, Europe looked as if it would need Latin American food exports and raw materials. The policies of import substitution industrialization adopted in Latin America when exports slowed due to the Great Depression and subsequent isolation in World War II were now subject to international competition. Those who supported a return to the export of commodities for which Latin America had a competitive advantage disagreed with advocates of an expanded industrial sector. The rebuilding of Europe, including Germany, with the aid of the U.S. after World War II did not bring stronger demand for Latin American exports. In Latin America, much of the hard currency earned by their participation in the war went to nationalize foreign-owned industries and pay down their debt. A number of governments set tariff and exchange rate policies that undermined the export sector and aided the urban working classes. Growth slowed in the post-war period and by the mid-1950s, the optimism of the postwar period was replaced by pessimism.

Following World War II, the United States policy toward Latin America focused on what it perceived as the threat of communism and the Soviet Union to the interests of Western Europe and the United States. Although Latin American countries had been staunch allies in the war and reaped some benefits from it, in the post-war period the region did not prosper as it had expected. Latin America struggled in the post-war period without large-scale aid from the U.S., which devoted its resources to rebuilding Western Europe, including Germany. In Latin America there was increasing inequality, with political consequences in the individual countries. The U.S. returned to a policy of interventionism when it felt its political and economic interests were threatened. With the breakup of the Soviet bloc in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the Soviet Union itself, Latin America sought to find new solutions to long-standing problems. With its Soviet alliance dissolved, Cuba entered a Special Period of severe economic disruption, high death rates, and food shortages.

Deeply alarming for the U.S. were two revolutions that threaten, fed its dominance in the region. The Guatemalan Revolution (1944–54) saw the replacement of a U.S.-backed regime of Jorge Ubico in 1945 followed by elections. Reformist Juan José Arévalo (1945–51) was elected and began instituting populist reforms. Reforms included land laws that threatened the interests of large foreign-owned enterprises, a social security law, workmen&#x27;s compensation, laws allowing labor to organize and strike, and universal suffrage except for illiterate women. His government established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union in April 1945, when the Soviet Union and the U.S. were allied against the Axis powers. Communists entered leadership positions in the labor movement. At the end of his term, his hand-picked successor, the populist and nationalist Jacobo Arbenz, was elected. Arbenz proposed placing capital in the hands of Guatemalans, building new infrastructure, and significant land reform via Decree 900. With what the U.S. considered the prospect of even more radical changes in Guatemala, it backed a coup against Arbenz in 1954, overthrowing him. Argentine Che Guevara was in Guatemala during the Arbenz presidency; the coup ousting Arbenz was instructive for him and for Latin American nations seeking significant structural change. In 1954 the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency aided successful military coup against Arbenz.
The 1959 Cuban Revolution led by Cuban lawyer Fidel Castro overthrew the regime of Fulgencio Batista, with 1 January 1959 marking as the revolution&#x27;s victory. The revolution was a huge event not only in Cuban history, but also the history of Latin America and the world. Almost the immediately, the U.S. reacted with hostility against the new regime. As the revolutionaries began consolidating power, many middle- and upper-class Cubans left for the U.S., likely not expecting the Castro regime to last long. Cuba became a poorer and blacker country, and the Cuba Revolution sought to transform the social and economic inequalities and political instability of the previous regimes into a more socially and economically equal one. The government put emphasis on literacy as a key to Cuba&#x27;s overall betterment, essentially wiping out illiteracy after an early major literacy campaign. Schools became a means to instill in Cuban students messages of nationalism, solidarity with the Third World, and Marxism. Cuba also made a commitment to universal health care, so the education of doctors and construction of hospitals were top priorities. Cuba also sought to diversify its economy, until then based mainly on sugar, but also tobacco.

The U.S. attempted to overthrow Castro, using the template of the successful 1954 coup in Guatemala. In the April 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuba entered into a formal alliance with the Soviet Union. In February 1962, the U.S. placed an embargo on trade with Cuba, which remains in force as of 2021. In February 1962, the U.S. pressured members of the Organization of American States to expel Cuba, attempting to isolate it. In response to the Bay of Pigs, Cuba called for revolution in the Americas. The efforts ultimately failed, most notably with Che Guevara in Bolivia, where he was isolated, captured, and executed.

When the U.S. discovered that the Soviet Union had placed missiles in Cuba in 1962, they reacted swiftly with a showdown now called the Cuban Missile Crisis, which ended with an agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, who did not consult Cuba about its terms. One term of the agreement was that the U.S. would cease efforts to invade Cuba, a guarantee of its sovereignty. However, the U.S. continued to attempt to remove Castro from power by assassination. The Soviet Union continued to materially support the Cuban regime, providing oil and other petrochemicals, technical support, and other aid, in exchange for Cuban sugar and tobacco.

From 1959 to 1992, Fidel Castro ruled as a caudillo, or strong man, dominating politics and the international stage. His commitment to social and economic equality brought about positive changes in Cuba, including the improvement of the position of women, eliminating prostitution, reducing homelessness, and raising the standard of living for most Cubans. However, Cuba lacks freedom of expression; dissenters were monitored by the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, and travel was restricted. In 1980, Castro told Cubans who wanted to leave to do so, promising that the government would not stop them. The Mariel boatlift saw some 125,000 Cubans sail from the Cuban port of Mariel, across the straits to the U.S., where U.S. President Carter initially welcomed them.

The Cuban Revolution had a tremendous impact not just on Cuba, but on Latin America as a whole, and the world. The Cuban Revolution was for many countries an inspiration and a model, but for the U.S. it was a challenge to its power and influence in Latin America. After leftists took power in Chile (1970) and Nicaragua (1979), Fidel Castro visited them both, extending Cuban solidarity. In Chile, Salvador Allende and a coalition of leftists, Unidad Popular, won an electoral victory in 1970 and lasted until the violent military coup of 11 September 1973. In the Nicaragua leftists held power from 1979 to 1990. The U.S. was concerned with the spread of communism in Latin America, and U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower responded to the threat he saw in the Dominican Republic&#x27;s dictator Rafael Trujillo, who voiced a desire to seek an alliance with the Soviet Union. In 1961, Trujillo was murdered with weapons supplied by the CIA. U.S. President John F. Kennedy initiated the Alliance for Progress in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America and provide $20 billion for reform and counterinsurgency measures. The reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who understood Latin American customs.

From 1966 to the late 1980s, the Soviet government upgraded Cuba&#x27;s military capabilities, and Cuba was active in foreign interventions, assisting with movements in several countries in Latin America and elsewhere in the world. Most notable were the MPLA during the Angolan Civil War and the Derg during the Ogaden War. They also supported governments and rebel movements in Syria, Mozambique, Algeria, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Vietnam.
In Chile, the postwar period saw uneven economic development. The mining sector (copper, nitrates) continued to be important, but an industrial sector also emerged. The agricultural sector stagnated and Chile needed to import foodstuffs. After the 1958 election, Chile entered a period of reform. The secret ballot was introduced, the Communist Party was relegalized, and populism grew in the countryside. In 1970, democratic elections brought to power socialist Salvador Allende, who implemented many reforms begun in 1964 under Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei. The economy continued to depend on mineral exports and a large portion of the population reaped no benefits from the prosperity and modernity of some sectors. Chile had a long tradition of stable electoral democracy, In the 1970 election, a coalition of leftists, the Unidad Popular (&quot;popular unity&quot;) candidate Allende was elected. Allende and his coalition held power for three years, with the increasing hostility of the U.S. The Chilean military staged a bloody coup with US support in 1973. The military under General Augusto Pinochet then held power until 1990.

The 1970s and 1980s saw a large and complex political conflict in Central America. The U.S. administration of Ronald Reagan funded right-wing governments and proxy fighters against left-wing challenges to the political order. Complicating matters were the liberation theology emerging in the Catholic Church and the rapid growth of evangelical Christianity, which were entwined with politics. The Nicaraguan Revolution revealed the country as a major proxy war battleground in the Cold War. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978–79 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate. During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received considerable aid from the Cold War superpowers. The Sandinistas allowed free elections in 1990 and after years of war, lost the election. They became the opposition party, following a peaceful transfer of power. A civil war in El Salvador pitted leftist guerrillas against a repressive government. The bloody war there ended in a stalemate, and following the fall of the Soviet Union, a negotiated peace accord ended the conflict in 1992. In Guatemala, the civil war included genocide of Mayan peasants. A peace accord was reached in 1996 and the Catholic Church called for a truth and reconciliation commission.
In the religious sphere, the Roman Catholic Church continued to be a major institution in nineteenth-century Latin America. For a number of countries in the nineteenth century, especially Mexico, liberals viewed the Catholic Church as an intransigent obstacle to modernization, and when liberals gained power, anticlericalism was written into law, such as the Mexican liberal Constitution of 1857 and the Uruguayan Constitution of 1913 which secularized the state. Nevertheless, most Latin Americans identified as Catholic, even if they did not attend church regularly. Many followed folk Catholicism, venerated saints, and celebrated religious festivals. Many communities did not have a resident priest or even visits by priests to keep contact between the institutional church and the people. In the 1950s, evangelical Protestants began proselytizing in Latin America. In Brazil, the Catholic bishops organized themselves into a national council, aimed at better meeting the competition not only of Protestants, but also of secular socialism and communism. Following Vatican II (1962–65) called by Pope John XXIII, the Catholic Church initiated a series of major reforms empowering the laity. Pope Paul VI actively implemented reforms and sought to align the Catholic Church on the side of the dispossessed, (&quot;preferential option for the poor&quot;), rather than remain a of conservative elites and right-wing repressive regimes. Colombian Catholic priest Camilo Torres took up arms with the Colombian guerrilla movement ELN, which modeled itself on Cuba but was killed in his first combat in 1966. In 1968, Pope Paul came to the meeting of Latin American bishops in Medellín, Colombia. Peruvian priest Gustavo Gutiérrez was one of the founders of liberation theology, a term he coined in 1968, sometimes described as linking Christianity and Marxism. Conservatives saw the church as politicized, and priests ask proselytizing leftist positions. Priests became targets as &quot;subversives&quot;, such as Salvadoran Jesuit Rutilio Grande. Archbishop of El Salvador Óscar Romero called for an end to persecution of the church, and took positions of social justice. He was assassinated on 24 March 1980 while saying mass. Liberation theology informed the struggle by Nicaraguan leftists against the Somoza dictatorship, and when they came to power in 1979, the ruling group included some priests.

When a Polish cleric became Pope John Paul II following the death of Paul VI, and the brief papacy of John Paul I, he reversed the progressive position of the church, evident in the 1979 Puebla conference of Latin American bishops. On a papal visit to Nicaragua in 1983, he reprimanded Father Ernesto Cardenal, who was Minister of Culture, and called on priests to leave politics. Brazilian theologian Leonardo Boff was silenced by the Vatican. Despite the Vatican stance against liberation theology, articulated in 1984 by Cardinal Josef Ratzinger, later Pope Benedict XVI, many Catholic clergy and laity worked against repressive military regimes. After a military coup ousted the democratically elected Salvador Allende, the Chilean Catholic Church was a force in opposition to the regime of Augusto Pinochet and for human rights. The Argentine Church did not follow the Chilean pattern of opposition however. When Jesuit Jorge Bergoglio was elected Pope Francis, his actions during the Dirty War were an issue, as portrayed in the film &quot;The Two Popes&quot;.

Although most countries did not have Catholicism as the established religion, Protestantism made few inroads in the region until the late twentieth century. Evangelical Protestants, particularly Pentecostals, proselytized and gained adherents in Brazil, Central America, and elsewhere. In Brazil, Pentecostals had a long history. But in a number of countries ruled by military dictatorships many Catholics followed the social and political teachings of liberation theology and were seen as subversives. Under these conditions, the influence of religious non-Catholics grew. Evangelical churches often grew quickly in poor communities where small churches and members could participate in ecstatic worship, often many times a week. Pastors in these churches did attend a seminary nor were there other institutional requirements. In some cases, the first evangelical pastors came from the U.S., but these churches quickly became &quot;Latin Americanized,&quot; with local pastors building religious communities. In some countries, they gained a significant hold and were not persecuted by military dictators, since they were largely apolitical. In Guatemala under General Efraín Ríos Montt, an evangelical Christian, Catholic Maya peasants were targeted as subversives and slaughtered. Perpetrators were later put on trial in Guatemala, including Ríos Montt.

=== Post–Cold War era ===

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Cold War which saw U.S. intervention in Latin America as preventing Soviet influence dissipating. The Central American wars ended, with a free and fair election in Nicaragua that voted out the leftist Sandinistas, a peace treaty was concluded between factions in El Salvador, and the Guatemalan civil war ended. Cuba had lost its political and economic patron, the Soviet Union, which could no longer provide support. Cuba entered what is known there are the Special Period, when the economy contracted severely, but the revolutionary government nonetheless retained power and the U.S. remained hostile to its revolution. U.S. policy-makers developed the Washington Consensus, a set of specific economic policy prescriptions considered the standard reform package for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.–based institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the US Department of the Treasury during the 1980s and 1990s. The term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries&#x27; national sovereignty. The politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by the 1994 NAFTA, and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of similar agreements. The comprehensive Free Trade Area of the Americas project, however, was rejected by most South American countries at the 4th Summit of the Americas in 2005.

A debt crisis ensured after 1982 when the price of oil crashed and Mexico announced that it could not meet its foreign debt payment obligations. Other Latin American economies followed suit, with hyperinflation and the inability of governments to meet their debt obligations and the era became known as the &quot;lost decade.&quot; The debt crisis would lead to neoliberal reforms that would instigate many social movements in the region. A &quot;reversal of development&quot; reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes. Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social programs, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and the informal sector of labor. In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced globalization through more open interactions with the international economy.

Significantly, democratic governments began replacing military regimes across much of Latin America and the realm of the state became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), but economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward, while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and development projects throughout the region increased both inequality and poverty. Feeling excluded from the new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.

Both urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of economic and global trends and voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent have been protests against cuts in urban services to the poor, such as the Caracazo in Venezuela and the Argentinazo in Argentina. In 2000, the Cochabamba Water War in Bolivia saw major protests against a World Bank-funded project that would have brought potable water to the city, but at a price that no residents could afford. The title of the Oscar nominated film &quot;Even the Rain&quot; alludes to the fact that Cochabamba residents could no longer legally collect rainwater; the film depicts the protest movement.

Rural movements made demands related to unequal land distribution, displacement at the hands of development projects and dams, environmental and Indigenous concerns, neoliberal agricultural restructuring, and insufficient means of livelihood. In Bolivia, coca workers organized into a union, and Evo Morales, ethnically an Aymara, became its head. The cocaleros supported the struggles in the Cochabamba water war. The rural-urban coalition became a political party, Movement for Socialism (Bolivia) (MAS, &quot;more&quot;), which decisively won the 2005 presidential election, making Evo Morales the first Indigenous president of Bolivia. A documentary of the campaign, &quot;Cocalero&quot;, shows how they successfully organized.

A number of movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and INGOs. The Movement of Rural Landless Workers (MST) in Brazil for example is an important contemporary Latin American social movement.

Indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including, in Mexico, the Zapatista rebellion and the broad Indigenous movement in Guerrero, Also important are the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and Indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the Indigenous groups of Yanomami peoples in the Amazon, Kuna peoples in Panama, and Altiplano Aymara and Quechua peoples in Bolivia.

==21st century==

===Turn to the left===
Since the 2000s, or 1990s in some countries, left-wing political parties have risen to power. Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Lula da Silva and Dilma Rousseff in Brazil, Fernando Lugo in Paraguay, Néstor and Cristina Kirchner in Argentina, Tabaré Vázquez and José Mujica in Uruguay, the Lagos and Bachelet governments in Chile, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Manuel Zelaya in Honduras (although deposed by the 28 June 2009 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;), and Rafael Correa of Ecuador are all part of this wave of left-wing politicians, who also often declare themselves socialists, Latin Americanists or anti-imperialists.

===Turn to the right and resurgence of the left===
The conservative wave () is a political phenomenon that emerged in mid-2010 in South America. In Brazil, it began roughly around the time Dilma Rousseff, in a tight election, won the 2014 presidential election, kicking off the fourth term of the Workers&#x27; Party in the highest position of government. In addition, according to the political analyst of the Inter-Union Department of Parliamentary Advice, Antônio Augusto de Queiroz, the National Congress elected in 2014 may be considered the most conservative since the &quot;re-democratization&quot; movement, noting an increase in the number of parliamentarians linked to more conservative segments, as ruralists, military, police and religious.

The subsequent economic crisis of 2015 and investigations of corruption scandals led to a right-wing movement that sought to rescue ideas from economic liberalism and conservatism in opposition to left-wing policies.

A resurgence of the rise of left-wing political parties in Latin America by their electoral victories, however, was initiated by Mexico in 2018 and Argentina in 2019, and further strengthened by Bolivia in 2020 along with Peru, Honduras and Chile in 2021 and Colombia and Brazil in 2022. However, right-wing candidates won both Ecuador’s and Argentina&#x27;s presidential elections in 2023.

<doc id="511631" wikidata="Q170306" url="?curid=511631" title="German revolution of 1918–1919">
<text>The German revolution of 1918–1919, also known as the November Revolution (), was an uprising started by workers and soldiers in the final days of World War I. It quickly and almost bloodlessly brought down the German Empire, then, in its more violent second stage, the supporters of a parliamentary republic were victorious over those who wanted a Soviet-style council republic. The defeat of the forces of the far left cleared the way for the establishment of the Weimar Republic. The key factors leading to the revolution were the extreme burdens suffered by the German people during the war, the economic and psychological impacts of the Empire&#x27;s defeat, and the social tensions between the general populace and the aristocratic and bourgeois elite.

The revolution began in late October 1918 with a sailors&#x27; mutiny at Kiel. Within a week, workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were in control of government and military institutions across most of the Reich. On 9 November, Germany was declared a republic. By the end of the month, all of the ruling monarchs, including Emperor Wilhelm II, had been forced to abdicate. On 10 November, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies was formed by members of Germany&#x27;s two main socialist parties. Under the &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of Friedrich Ebert of the moderate Majority Social Democratic Party (MSPD), the Council acted as a provisional government that held the powers of the emperor, chancellor and legislature. Most of the old imperial officer corps, administration and judiciary remained in place. The Council needed their expertise to resolve the crises of the moment and thought that handling them was more important than ousting many key government figures to ensure that the new democracy was firmly anchored against its opponents.

The Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies&#x27; immediately removed some of the Empire&#x27;s harsh restrictions, such as on freedom of expression, and promised an eight-hour workday and elections that would give women the right to vote for the first time. Those on the left wing of the revolution also wanted to nationalise key industries, democratise the military and set up a council republic, but the MSPD had control of most of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils and blocked any substantial movement towards their goals.

The split between the moderate and radical socialists erupted into violence in the last days of 1918, sparked by a dispute over sailors&#x27; pay that left 67 dead. On 1 January 1919, the far Left Spartacists founded the Communist Party of Germany. A few days later, protests resulting from the violence at the end of December led to mass demonstrations in Berlin that quickly turned into the Spartacist uprising, an attempt to create a dictatorship of the proletariat. It was quashed by government and &quot;Freikorps&quot; troops with the loss of 150 to 200 lives. In the aftermath of the uprising, the Spartacist leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht were murdered by the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. Into the spring, there were additional violently suppressed efforts to push the revolution further in the direction of a council republic, as well as short-lived local soviet republics, notably in Bavaria (Munich), Bremen and Würzburg. They too were put down with considerable loss of life.

The revolution&#x27;s end date is generally set at 11 August 1919, the day the Weimar Constitution was adopted; however, the revolution remained in many ways incomplete. A large number of its opponents had been left in positions of power, and it failed to resolve the fracture in the Left between moderate socialists and communists. The Weimar Republic as a result was beset from the beginning by opponents from both the Left and – to a greater degree – the Right. The fractures in the German Left that had become permanent during the revolution made Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power in 1933 easier than it might have been if the Left had been more united.

== Background ==

=== German socialist parties ===
When World War I started, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) was the one socialist political party of any significance in the German Empire and as such played a major role in the revolution. It had been banned from 1878–1890 and in 1914 continued to adhere to the tenets of class conflict. It had international ties to other countries&#x27; socialist parties, all of which were ideologically anti-war. Patriotism nevertheless proved the stronger force when the war broke out, and the SPD threw its support behind the Fatherland.

By 1917, some on the left of the party had become so outspokenly anti-war that they were expelled from the SPD and formed a new party, the Independent Social Democrats (USPD) – from which the Communist Party of Germany broke off shortly after the end of the war. The SPD and USPD tried to work together during the early days of the revolution, but their differing goals – parliamentary versus council republics – proved irreconcilable. After the fall of the German monarchy, the increasing antagonism between the three socialist parties drove the violence of the revolution&#x27;s second stage.

==== SPD and the World War ====
By 1912, the Social Democrats had grown into the largest political party in Germany, with 35% of the national vote and 110 seats in the last imperial Reichstag. In spite of its predominance, the party had no role in the imperial government. Its official espousal of Marxist revolutionary socialism aroused the distrust of the parties of the centre and Right, and its members were often disparaged as &quot;journeymen without a fatherland&quot; () because their class antagonism was seen to transcend national boundaries.

The SPD had attended the congresses of the Second International beginning in 1889, where they had agreed to resolutions asking for combined action by socialists in the event of a war. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, the SPD, like other socialist parties in Europe, organised anti-war demonstrations during the July Crisis that led up to the war&#x27;s outbreak.

In contrast to the widespread enthusiasm for the war among the educated classes (the &quot;Spirit of 1914&quot;), the majority of SPD newspapers were strongly anti-war, although some supported it by pointing out the danger posed by the Russian Empire, which they saw as the most reactionary and anti-socialist power in Europe. Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg turned down plans by high-ranking military officials to dissolve the SPD at the start of the war and exploited the party&#x27;s anti-Russian stance to gain its approval for it.

After Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August 1914, 96 SPD deputies, among them Friedrich Ebert, agreed to approve the war bonds requested by the imperial government. Fourteen deputies, headed by party co-leader Hugo Haase, and including Karl Liebknecht, spoke out against the bonds but nevertheless followed party discipline and voted in favour. The support was based primarily on the belief, actively fostered by the government, that Germany was fighting a defensive war. Haase explained the decision that the party had made with the words: &quot;We will not abandon our Fatherland in its hour of danger!&quot; Many SPD members were eager to show their patriotism, in part to free themselves from the charge of being &quot;journeymen without a fatherland&quot;.

Since the SPD was the only party whose position was in any real doubt, its unanimous vote for the war bonds was greeted with great enthusiasm as a sign of Germany&#x27;s national unity. The Emperor welcomed the political truce (&quot;Burgfriedenspolitik&quot;) among the Reichstag&#x27;s parties in which they agreed not to criticise the government&#x27;s handling of the war and to keep their disagreements out of public view. He declared: &quot;I no longer know parties, I know only Germans!&quot;

==== SPD&#x27;s split ====
As the war dragged on and the death toll rose, more SPD members began to question the party&#x27;s support for the war. The dissatisfaction increased when the Supreme Army Command (OHL) introduced the Auxiliary Services Act in December 1916. It proposed full mobilisation and deployment of the workforce, including women, and the &quot;militarisation&quot; of labour relations. It met with such strong criticism that the OHL had to agree to participation by trade unions and the Reichstag parties in the act&#x27;s implementation. It accepted their demands for arbitration committees, the expansion of trade union powers and a repeal of the act at the end of the war.

After the outbreak of the Russian February Revolution in 1917, the wartime&#x27;s first organised strikes erupted in German armament factories in January 1918. 400,000 workers went on strike in Berlin and around a million nationwide. Their primary demand was an end to the war. The SPD took part in the strike in order to keep the Spartacists from having control of the strike&#x27;s leadership, but its participation soured the SPD&#x27;s relationship with the other parties in the Reichstag. The strike was put down by the military after a week.

Because of the increasing intra-party conflicts centering around the opponents of the war, the leadership of the SPD under Friedrich Ebert expelled them from the party in January 1917. The Spartacists, who had formed the SPD&#x27;s far left wing, joined with revisionists such as Eduard Bernstein and centrist Marxists such as Karl Kautsky to found the anti-war Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) under the leadership of Hugo Haase on 6 April 1917. After that point, the SPD was officially named the Majority Social Democratic Party of Germany (MSPD), although it was still generally referred to as the SPD. The USPD called for an immediate end to the war and a further democratisation of Germany but did not have a unified agenda for social policies. Both the USPD and the Spartacists continued their anti-war propaganda in factories, especially in armament plants.

In April 1917, the German government facilitated Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s return to Russia from his exile in Switzerland in the hope that he would weaken the tsarist regime and its conduct of the war. After the 1917 October Revolution that put Lenin and the Bolsheviks in power, many in both Russia and Germany expected that soviet Russia would in return help foment a communist revolution in Germany. For Germany&#x27;s far Left, it provided hope for its own success, and for the moderate socialists, along with the middle and upper classes, it was a source of fear that the kind of bloody civil war that was occurring in Russia could also break out in Germany.

The moderate SPD leadership consequently shifted away from the party&#x27;s official stance as revolutionary socialists. Otto Braun clarified the SPD&#x27;s position in an article titled &quot;The Bolsheviks and Us&quot; () in the party newspaper of 15 February 1918: &quot;Socialism cannot be erected on bayonets and machine guns. If it is to last, it must be realised with democratic means. ... Therefore we must draw a thick, visible dividing line between ourselves and the Bolsheviks.&quot;

On 3 March 1918, the newly established Soviet government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany to end Russia&#x27;s involvement in the war. It arguably contained harsher terms for the Russians than the later Treaty of Versailles would demand of the Germans.

==== Military collapse ====

On 29 September 1918, the Supreme Army Command informed Emperor Wilhelm II and Chancellor Georg von Hertling that the military situation was hopeless in the face of the enemy&#x27;s overwhelming advantage in manpower and equipment. General Ludendorff said that a request for an immediate ceasefire should be sent to the Entente powers. In hopes of more favourable peace terms, he also recommended accepting American president Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s demand that the imperial government be democratised. His aim was to protect the reputation of the Imperial Army by placing the responsibility for the capitulation and its consequences at the feet of the democratic parties and the Reichstag. In a veiled reference to the workers who had struck the armaments plants, the Social Democrats who had helped pass the Reichstag Peace Resolution in July 1917 and the radical Spartacists who wanted a dictatorship of the proletariat, he said to his staff officers on 1 October:I have asked His Majesty to bring into the government those circles to whom we mainly owe it that we have come this far. ... Let them now make the peace that must be made. They should eat the soup they have served up to us!His statement marked the birth of the &quot;stab-in-the-back myth&quot; (), according to which revolutionary socialists and republican politicians had betrayed the undefeated army and turned an almost certain victory into a defeat.

==== Political response ====
Although shocked by Ludendorff&#x27;s report and the news of the certain defeat, the majority parties in the Reichstag, especially the SPD, were willing to take on the responsibility of government. Chancellor Hertling objected to introducing a parliamentary system and resigned. Emperor Wilhelm II appointed Prince Max of Baden as the new imperial chancellor on 3 October. The Prince was considered a liberal and at the same time was a representative of the royal family. Most of the men in his cabinet were independents, but there were also two members of the SPD. The following day, the new government offered the Allies the truce that Ludendorff had insisted on, and on the fifth the German public was informed of the dismal situation that it faced. Even up to that late point, government propaganda and the press had led the people to believe that the war would still be won. The shock of the impending defeat caused a &quot;paralytic bitterness and deep resignation&quot; which eased the way for those who wanted an immediate ceasefire.

During October, President Wilson responded to the request for a truce with three diplomatic notes. As a precondition for negotiations, he demanded the retreat of Germany from all occupied territories, the cessation of submarine activities and (implicitly) the Emperor&#x27;s abdication. Following the third note of 24 October, which emphasised the danger to international peace inherent in the power of the &quot;King of Prussia&quot; and the &quot;military authorities of the Empire&quot;, General Ludendorff resigned and was replaced as First General Quartermaster by General Wilhelm Groener.

On 28 October, the Reichstag passed constitutional reforms that changed Germany into a parliamentary monarchy. The chancellor and his ministers were made dependent on the confidence of the parliamentary majority rather than the emperor, and peace treaties and declarations of war required the Reichstag&#x27;s approval. Because the chancellor was also responsible for the emperor&#x27;s acts under the constitution, the emperor&#x27;s military right of command (&quot;Kommandogewalt&quot;) became the chancellor&#x27;s responsibility and thus subject to parliamentary control. As far as the Social Democrats were concerned, the October Constitution met all the party&#x27;s important constitutional objectives. Ebert regarded the formation of the Baden government as the birthday of German democracy. Since the Emperor had voluntarily ceded power, he considered a revolution unnecessary.

On 5 November, the Entente Powers agreed to take up negotiations for a truce. After the third note, many soldiers had come to expect the war to end and were anxious to return home. They had little willingness to fight more battles, and desertions were increasing.

== Revolution, first stage: fall of the Empire ==
The sociologist Max Weber attributed the collapse of the Empire to the &quot;hollowing out&quot; of Germany&#x27;s traditional standards during the war. The expansion of black markets also revealed the economic and monetary failures of the Wilhelmine system. Since it was Emperor Wilhelm who embodied the system that had led to the long years of hardship and privation for the people at home and to the impending defeat in the war, the conviction spread that he would have to abdicate. Historian Eberhard Kolb saw a vast &quot;paralysis of the will&quot; in the state&#x27;s power to preserve order and a corresponding desire among the people for a more complete transformation of the political and social order. The German populace was already war weary when the request for a ceasefire came like a thunderbolt. From that point, they wanted only peace. Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points fed the belief that Germany would get a just peace if it democratised, and so the desire for peace led to demands for democracy. The revolutionary groups that had been weak and disorganized were emboldened, and even the middle class began to fear that the constitutional reforms would not be enough to bring the war to a quick end without the Emperor&#x27;s abdication.

=== Sailors&#x27; revolt ===
The German revolution was triggered by a sailors&#x27; mutiny centered on the North Sea ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven in late October 1918. While the war-weary troops and general population of Germany awaited the end of the war, the Imperial Naval Command in Kiel under Admiral Franz von Hipper and Admiral Reinhard Scheer planned without authorization to dispatch the Imperial Fleet for a last battle against the British Royal Navy in the southern North Sea.

The naval order of 24 October 1918 and the preparations to sail triggered a mutiny among the sailors involved. They had no intention of risking their lives so close to the end of the war and were convinced that the credibility of the new government, engaged as it was in seeking an armistice with the Entente, would be compromised by a naval attack at such a crucial point in the negotiations.

The mutiny began on a small number of ships anchored off Wilhelmshaven. Faced with the sailors&#x27; disobedience, naval command called off the offensive during the night of 29–30 October, arrested several hundred of the mutineers and had the ships return to port. On 3 November, police and soldiers confronted a protest march by the sailors towards the prison in Kiel where the mutineers were being held. The soldiers opened fire and killed at least nine protestors. The following day, workers in Kiel declared a general strike in support of the protest, and sailors from the barracks at Wik, north of Kiel, joined the march, as did many of the soldiers sent to help control the protests.

Faced with the rapidly escalating situation, Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, the naval commander in Kiel, released the imprisoned sailors and asked the protestors to send a delegation to meet with him and two representatives of the Baden government who had arrived from Berlin. The sailors had a list of fourteen demands, including less harsh military punishment and full freedom of speech and the press in the Empire. One of the representatives from the Reich government, Gustav Noske of the Majority Social Democrats (SPD), calmed the immediate situation with a promise of amnesty, but by then Kiel was already in the hands of a workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council, and groups of sailors had gone to nearby cities to spread the uprising. Within days the revolution had encompassed the western part of Germany.

=== Spread of the revolution ===
By 7 November, the revolution had taken control in all large coastal cities – Lübeck, Bremen, Hamburg – and spread to Braunschweig, Cologne and as far south as Munich. There, Kurt Eisner of the radical Independent Social Democrats (USPD) was elected president of the Bavarian Workers&#x27;, Peasants&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Council, and on 8 November he proclaimed the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria. King Ludwig III and his family fled Munich for Austria, where in the 12 November Anif declaration he relieved all civil servants and military personnel from their oath of loyalty to him, effectively abdicating the Wittlesbach throne. By the end of the month, the dynastic rulers of all the other German states had abdicated without bloodshed.
There was little to no resistance to the establishment of the councils. Soldiers by simple acclamation often elected their most respected comrades; workers generally chose members of the local executive committees of the SPD or USPD. With the support of local citizens, they freed political prisoners and occupied city halls, military facilities and train stations. The military authorities surrendered or fled, and civic officials accepted that they were under the control of the councils rather than the military and carried on with their work. Little changed in the factories except for the removal of the military discipline that had prevailed during the war. Private property was not touched. The sociologist Max Weber was part of the workers&#x27; council of Heidelberg and was pleasantly surprised that most members were moderate German liberals. The councils took over the distribution of food, the police force and the accommodation and provisions of the front-line soldiers who were gradually returning home.

The workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were made up almost entirely of SPD and USPD members. Their program called for an end to the war and to the authoritarian monarchical state. Apart from the dynastic families, they deprived only the military commands of their power and privilege. There were hardly any confiscations of property or occupations of factories. The duties of the imperial civilian administration and office holders such as police, municipal administrations and courts were not curtailed or interfered with. In order to create an executive committed to the revolution and to the future of the new government, the councils for the moment left government officials in place and took over only their supervision from the military commands that had been put in place during the war.

Notably, revolutionary sentiment did not affect the eastern parts of Germany to any considerable extent, apart from isolated instances of agitation at Breslau in Silesia and Königsberg in East Prussia.

=== Reaction in Berlin ===

Friedrich Ebert, the leader of the SPD, agreed with the chancellor, Prince Max of Baden, that a social revolution had to be prevented and order upheld at all costs. In the restructuring of the state, Ebert wanted to win over the middle class parties that had cooperated with the SPD in the Reichstag in 1917 as well as the old elites of the German Empire. He wanted to avoid the spectre of radicalisation of the revolution along Russian lines and was also worried that the precarious food supply situation could break down, leading to the takeover of the administration by inexperienced revolutionaries. He was certain that the SPD would be able to implement its reform plans in the future due to its parliamentary majorities.

Ebert did his best to act in agreement with the old powers and intended to save the monarchy. In hopes that the Emperor&#x27;s departure and the establishment of a regency would save the constitutional monarchy that had been established on 28 October, the SPD called for Wilhelm&#x27;s abdication on 7 November. According to notes taken by Prince Max of Baden, Ebert told him, &quot;If the Emperor does not abdicate, the social revolution is unavoidable. But I do not want it, indeed I hate it like sin.&quot;

Wilhelm II, still at his headquarters in Spa, was considering returning to Germany at the head of the army to quell any unrest in Berlin. Even when General Groener told him that the army no longer supported him, he did not abdicate. The Chancellor planned to travel to Spa to convince Wilhelm personally of the necessity, but his plans were overtaken by the rapidly deteriorating situation in Berlin.

=== Abdication and proclamations of a republic ===

Instead of going to Spa to meet with the Emperor in person, Chancellor von Baden telephoned him on the morning of 9 November and tried to convince him to hand the throne over to a regent who would constitutionally name Ebert chancellor. After his efforts failed, Baden, without authorization, proclaimed to the public that the Emperor and the Crown Prince had renounced the German and Prussian thrones. Immediately thereafter, following a short meeting of the cabinet, the Prince transferred the chancellorship to Friedrich Ebert, a move that was not allowed under the constitution. Ebert quickly released a statement announcing the formation of a new &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot; whose immediate tasks were to end the war as quickly as possible and to ensure a sufficient supply of food for the German people, who were still suffering under the impact of the Allied blockade. The statement ended with &quot;Leave the streets! Keep order and peace!&quot;

The premature news of the abdication came too late to make any impression on the demonstrators who had filled the streets of Berlin. Nobody heeded the public appeals. While having lunch in the Reichstag building, the SPD deputy chairman Philipp Scheidemann learned that Karl Liebknecht of the Spartacus League planned to proclaim a socialist republic. Scheidemann did not want to leave the initiative to the Spartacists and stepped to a window of the Reichstag building where he proclaimed a republic before the mass of demonstrators gathered there. Ebert, who believed that the decision about the future form of the government of Germany belonged to a national assembly of the people&#x27;s democratically elected representatives, stormed angrily at Scheidemann for his spontaneous decision to announce a republic. A few hours later, in the Berlin Lustgarten, Liebknecht proclaimed a socialist republic, which he reaffirmed from a balcony of the Berlin Palace to an assembled crowd at around 4 pm.

The Emperor had fallen, but the form of the new government was still in dispute.

== Revolution, second stage: defeat of the radical Left ==
Once the monarchy had collapsed under the pressure of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils, it was up to the leadership of the socialist parties in Berlin to quickly establish the new order and address the many critical problems the defeated nation faced. From the beginning, the moderates of the SPD held the leading position. They had the broadest support from the working class and the at least grudging backing of the imperial bureaucracy, most of which remained in place. When Ebert showed himself willing to use the military and &quot;Freikorps&quot; against opposing members of the socialist Left, it quickly led to fractures between the SPD and USPD and then to street battles with the Spartacists and communists.

=== The councils ===

==== Establishment, pact with the military and armistice ====
Ebert wanted to take the sting out of the revolutionary mood and to meet the demands of the 9 November demonstrators for the unity of the labour parties. He offered the USPD equal participation in the government and was ready to accept Karl Liebknecht as a minister. The USPD, at Liebknecht&#x27;s insistence, demanded that elected representatives of the unions and soldiers have full executive, legislative and judicial control. The SPD refused, and negotiations got no further that day.

Around 8 pm, a group of 100 Revolutionary Stewards from the larger Berlin factories occupied the Reichstag. Led by their spokesmen Richard Müller and Emil Barth, they formed a revolutionary parliament. Most of the participating stewards had been leaders during the strikes earlier in the year. They did not trust the SPD leadership and had planned a coup for 11 November independently of the sailors&#x27; revolt, but were unprepared for the revolutionary events since Kiel. In order to take the initiative from Ebert, they decided to announce elections for the following day, a Sunday. Every Berlin factory was to elect workers&#x27; councils and every regiment soldiers&#x27; councils that were then to elect a revolutionary government from members of the two labour parties (SPD and USPD) in the evening. The government would be empowered to execute the resolutions of the revolutionary parliament, since they intended to replace Ebert&#x27;s function as chancellor.

On the evening of the ninth, the SPD leadership learned of the plans for the elections and the councils&#x27; meeting. Since they could not be prevented, Otto Wels used the party apparatus to influence the voting in the soldiers&#x27; councils and won most of them over to the SPD. By morning it was clear that the SPD would have the majority of the delegates on its side at the councils&#x27; meeting that evening.

USPD chairman Hugo Haase returned from Kiel the morning of 10 November and was able to broker a compromise in the negotiations with the SPD about the new government. The revolutionary government, to be called the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies () at the USPD&#x27;s insistence, gave the USPD much of what it wanted. The Council was to be made up of three representatives of the SPD (Ebert, Scheidemann and Otto Landsberg) and three from the USPD (Haase, Wilhelm Dittmann and Emil Barth). The workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils were to be given political power – not full executive, legislative and judicial control – and a national assembly would be discussed only &quot;after a consolidation of the conditions created by the revolution&quot;.In the assembly of the newly elected councils that convened in the afternoon at the Circus Busch, almost all of the soldiers&#x27; councils and a large part of the workers&#x27; representatives stood on the side of the SPD. After it ratified the membership of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies, Emil Barth called for an action committee to oversee it and presented a list of names drawn up by the Revolutionary Stewards. The proposal took the SPD leadership by surprise and started heated debates in the assembly. Ebert was able to push through an &quot;Executive Council of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils of Greater Berlin&quot; () made up of seven SPD members, seven from the USPD and fourteen mostly independent soldiers&#x27; representatives. It was to oversee the People&#x27;s Deputies until the creation of a national assembly and was chaired by Richard Müller of the USPD and representing the soldiers.

On the evening of the same day, a phone call between Ebert and General Wilhelm Groener, the new First Quartermaster General, resulted in the unofficial and secret Ebert–Groener pact. In exchange for Groener&#x27;s assurance of the army&#x27;s support &quot;for the good of the state&quot;, Ebert promised Groener that the military&#x27;s hierarchies and command structures would not be changed. He thus made no attempt to democratise the authoritarian military. As Groener stated in his memoirs: &quot;The best and strongest element of the old Prussianism was saved for the new Germany.&quot;

In the turmoil of the day, the Ebert government&#x27;s acceptance of the Entente&#x27;s harsh terms for a ceasefire after a renewed demand from the Supreme Army Command went almost unnoticed. On 11 November, the Centre Party deputy Matthias Erzberger signed the armistice agreement at Compiègne, France, on behalf of the government in Berlin, and World War I came to an end.

==== Interim government ====

On 12 November, the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies published its government programme in the proclamation &quot;To the German People&quot;. It lifted the state of siege and censorship, granted amnesty to all political prisoners, guaranteed freedom of association, assembly and the press and abolished the rules that governed relations between servant and master. It also promised the introduction of direct, equal and universal suffrage for all women and men from the age of 20 years, the eight-hour workday and improvements in benefits for unemployment, social insurance and workers&#x27; compensation.

In theory, the Executive Council of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils of Greater Berlin was the highest-ranking council of the revolutionary regime and therefore Richard Müller the head of state of the newly declared &quot;Socialist Republic of Germany&quot;, but in practice the Executive Council&#x27;s initiative was blocked by internal power struggles. In the eight weeks of the double rule of the Executive Council and the Ebert-led government, the latter was always dominant. Although Haase was formally co-chairman in the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies with equal rights, the higher level administration almost always preferred to work with the more moderate Ebert and the SPD.

The government saw its immediate tasks as fulfilling the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, demobilisation, providing adequate food and fuel supplies for a nation still under the Allied blockade and ensuring both internal and foreign security against separatists in the Rhine Province and Polish insurgents in the East. In order to make sure that the new democracy was firmly anchored, the government would have had to make an almost complete break with the old institutions, but the SPD decided that facing the immediate post-war crises was more important. To do that, it had to rely on existing structures and expertise within both the government and private enterprise. Even after 9 November, far from everything had collapsed. The administration continued to function. Civil servants from the imperial era were under the supervision of the councils but kept their positions and continued to do their work in most respects unchanged. The judiciary and education systems had been only minimally affected by the revolution if at all, and after the Ebert–Groener Pact, the Supreme Army Command became a partner of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies. Generals and other high-ranking officers kept their positions. The Ebert government needed the OHL to manage the monumental problem of demobilisation, but the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies did not try to limit its powers to the most essential tasks. No attempt was made to dispossess the East Elbian nobility (which had historically provided much of the officer corps) or the bourgeois owners of large estates.

The SPD and USPD were under great time pressure to act. When the two parties formed their alliance, it chose to govern outside the imperial constitution. It instructed the Reichstag not to reconvene and decreed that the existing Federal Council of the states (&quot;Bundesrat&quot;) should exercise only its administrative functions, not its legislative powers. The Council in essence took over the former roles of the emperor, chancellor, &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and Reichstag. The Council began working according to rules of procedure on 12 November. The rules prohibited unauthorised intervention in the administration by individual members of the Council. Its instructions to the state secretaries had to be issued collectively and only as guidelines, not for individual cases.

Through the various councils, the socialists were able to establish a firm base at the local level. But while they believed that they were acting in the interest of the new order, the party leaders of the SPD regarded them as elements that threatened the peaceful changeover of power that they imagined had already taken place. Along with the middle-class parties, they pushed for speedy elections to a national assembly that would make the final decision on the form of the new state. The position soon brought the SPD into opposition with many of the revolutionaries. The USPD continued to want to delay elections until after the achievements of the revolution had been consolidated.

Although Ebert had saved the decisive position of the SPD and prevented a social revolution, he was not happy with the results. He did not regard the council assembly or the Executive Council as helpful, but rather as obstacles impeding a smooth transition from monarchy to a new system of government. The entire SPD leadership mistrusted the councils rather than the old elites in the army and administration. At the same time they considerably overestimated the old elite&#x27;s loyalty to the new republic. Ebert could no longer act as chancellor in front of the OHL or his middle-class colleagues among the ministers and in the Reichstag, but only as chairman of a revolutionary government. In spite of having taken the lead of the revolution in order to halt it, conservatives saw him as a traitor.

==== Nationalisation and labour unions ====

At the insistence of the USPD representatives, the Council of People&#x27;s Deputies appointed a &quot;Nationalisation Committee&quot; that included the Marxist theoreticians Karl Kautsky and Rudolf Hilferding, the chairman of the Socialist Miners&#x27; Union Otto Hue and a number of leading economists. The committee was to examine which industries were &quot;fit&quot; for nationalisation and to prepare for the nationalisation of the coal industry. It sat until 7 April 1919 without producing any tangible results. &quot;Self-Administration Bodies&quot; were installed only at coal and potash mines. From those bodies emerged the modern German Works Councils, or Factory Committees.

Like the SPD moderates, the unions also feared the councils because their supporters saw them as replacing the unions. To prevent such a development, union leader Carl Legien (SPD) met with representatives of heavy industry led by Hugo Stinnes in Berlin from 9 to 12 November. On 15 November, they signed the Stinnes–Legien Agreement, which had advantages for both sides. Employers acknowledged trade unions as the official representatives of the workforce and recognised their right to collective bargaining. The agreement also introduced the eight-hour day, allowed for the creation of workers&#x27; councils and arbitration committees in firms with more than 50 employees and guaranteed that returning soldiers would have a right to their pre-war jobs. Future disputes were to be resolved through a newly created organisation called the &quot;Central Working Group&quot; (, or ZAG).

With the agreement, the unions had achieved several of their longtime demands, and by their recognition of private enterprise, they made the efforts towards nationalising the means of production more difficult.

==== Reich Congress of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils ====
The Executive Council called for a meeting of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils from the entire country to be held in Berlin beginning on 16 December. When the Reich Congress of Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Councils () met in the hall of the Prussian House of Representatives, it consisted mainly of SPD followers. Not even Karl Liebknecht or Rosa Luxemburg had been chosen to attend, leaving the Spartacus League without influence. On 19 December, the Council voted 344 to 98 against the creation of a council system as the basis for a new constitution. Instead, they supported the government&#x27;s decision to call for elections as soon as possible for a constituent national assembly to decide on the future state system.

The Congress then approved a proposal by the SPD to give the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies lawgiving and executive power until the national assembly made a final decision on the form of government. Oversight of the Council was switched from the Berlin Executive Council to a new Central Council of the German Socialist Republic (&quot;Zentralrat der Deutschen Sozialistischen Republik&quot;). After the Congress accepted the SPD&#x27;s definition of parliamentary oversight, the USPD boycotted the election to the Central Council, with the result that it had only SPD members.

With the oversight of the Berlin Executive Council, the People&#x27;s Deputies were to exercise military command authority and to see to the ending of militarism. The Congress voted unanimously for the democratisation of the military as laid out in the Hamburg Points: there were to be no more rank insignia and no carrying of weapons when not in service; soldiers were to elect officers; soldiers&#x27; councils were to be responsible for discipline; and the standing army was to be replaced by a people&#x27;s army (&quot;Volkswehr&quot;). The Army Command strongly objected to the Hamburg Points, and no trace of them was left in the Weimar Constitution.

=== Turn to violence ===

==== Opposition from the Right ====
On 6 December 1918, in what was likely a putsch attempt, a group of armed students and soldiers, including some members of the People&#x27;s Navy Division (), went to the Reich Chancellery and asked Friedrich Ebert to accept the office of president with nearly dictatorial powers, an offer that Ebert carefully refused. At around the same time – although some sources say that it involved the same demonstrators who spoke to Ebert – a group of soldiers briefly took the members of the Executive Council into custody. In an unrelated incident several hours later, members of the Garde-Füsilier-Regiment, which was responsible for security in Berlin&#x27;s government quarter, fired on an approved Spartacist demonstration, killing 16 and seriously wounding 12. It is not certain who gave the order to fire or who was behind the assumed putsch. The historian Heinrich August Winkler attributes it to &quot;high-ranking officers and officials&quot; who planned to have Ebert disband the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils with the military&#x27;s support.

Ebert and the Army High Command (OHL) had agreed that troops returning from the front would parade through Berlin on 10 December. Ebert greeted them with a glowing speech that included words that would help give rise to the stab-in-the-back myth: &quot;No enemy overcame you.&quot; General Groener had wanted to use the soldiers to disarm the civilians of Berlin and rid it of Spartacists, but the majority of the soldiers wanted only to return home for Christmas with their families and simply dispersed into the city after the parade. Their lack of interest in more fighting put an end to Groener&#x27;s hope that he could lead the troops to domestic successes that would make the OHL the recognized force in restoring order.

As a result of the events, the potential for violence and the danger of a coup from the Right became visible. Rosa Luxemburg, in the Spartacist newspaper &quot;Rote Fahne&quot; (&quot;Red Flag&quot;), demanded the peaceful disarmament of returning soldiers by the workers of Berlin. She wanted the soldiers&#x27; councils to be subordinated to the revolutionary parliament and the soldiers to be &quot;re-educated&quot;.

==== Christmas crisis ====
Because the People&#x27;s Navy Division had been helpful to the government in Kiel and was considered loyal, it was ordered to Berlin in early November to help protect the city&#x27;s government quarter and stationed in the Royal Stables across from the Berlin Palace. Following the coup attempt of 6 December, the sailors deposed their commander because of his alleged involvement in it. The government came to see the division as generally standing with the leftist revolutionaries, and on 23 December, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies ordered it out of Berlin, considerably reduced its size and refused the men their pay.

The sailors then occupied the Reich Chancellery, cut the phone lines, put the Council of People&#x27;s Representatives under house arrest and took Otto Wels hostage and physically abused him. Ebert, who was in touch with the Supreme Command in Kassel via a secret phone line, gave orders on the morning of 24 December to attack the Palace with troops loyal to the government. The sailors repelled the attack after they were joined by armed workers and the security forces of the Berlin police. The government troops had to withdraw with the loss of 56 soldiers. The People&#x27;s Navy Division, which counted just 11 deaths, was allowed to remain intact, and the sailors received their pay.

The main result of the Christmas crisis, which the Spartacists named &quot;Ebert&#x27;s Bloody Christmas&quot;, was that the USPD resigned from the government in protest on 29 December. Its three members were replaced on the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies by two from the SPD: Gustav Noske (responsible for the military) and Rudolf Wissell (labour and social affairs). In light of the military&#x27;s failure at the Berlin Palace, Noske ordered a strengthening of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; for use against internal enemies.

==== Founding of the Communist Party and Spartacist uprising ====
After their experiences with the SPD and the USPD, the Spartacists concluded that their goals could be met only by forming a party of their own. They therefore joined with other left-socialist groups from across Germany to found the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).

Rosa Luxemburg drew up a founding programme and presented it on 31 December 1918. She wrote that the communists could never take power without the clear will of the majority of the people. On 1 January she proposed that the KPD participate in the elections for a national assembly, but a motion to boycott the elections passed 62 to 23. In the words of Marxist historian Arthur Rosenberg, the majority still implicitly hoped to gain power through &quot;putschist adventures&quot;. After deliberations with the Spartacists, the Revolutionary Stewards decided to remain in the USPD.

A wave of violence started on 4 January when the Prussian government dismissed the chief of the Berlin police, Emil Eichhorn (USPD), for supporting the People&#x27;s Navy Division during the Christmas crisis. His dismissal led the USPD, Revolutionary Stewards and KPD chairmen Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck to call for a demonstration the following day. On 5 January, as on 9 November 1918, hundreds of thousands of people poured into the centre of Berlin, many of them armed. In the afternoon, the train stations and the newspaper district with the offices of the middle-class press and the SPD&#x27; were occupied.
The demonstrators were mainly the same people who had participated in the revolutionary actions in November who were demanding the fulfilment of their wish for a workers&#x27; government expressed two months previously. The so-called &quot;Spartacist uprising&quot; that followed originated only partially in the KPD. The Spartacists did not have a leading position in January 1919. KPD members were a minority among the insurgents.

The initiators of the revolt, who had gathered at the Police Headquarters, elected a 53-member &quot;Interim Revolutionary Committee&quot; () that failed to make use of its power and was unable to give any clear direction. Liebknecht wanted the government overthrown and agreed with the majority of the Committee that supported an armed struggle. Rosa Luxemburg and other KPD leaders (Leo Jogiches, Karl Radek) thought a revolt at that time to be premature and spoke out against it, although Luxemburg later gave in and followed the will of the majority of the Committee.
On the following day, 6 January, the Revolutionary Committee again called for a mass demonstration. Even more people heeded the call and filled the streets from the Siegesallee to the Alexanderplatz. But the masses were leaderless; the Committee provided no direction and no orders to act. In addition, the protestors lacked support from the military. Even the People&#x27;s Navy Division was unwilling to support the armed revolt and declared themselves neutral. The other regiments stationed in Berlin mostly remained loyal to the government. As a result, very little happened that day.

While more troops were moving into Berlin on Ebert&#x27;s order, he accepted an offer by the USPD to mediate between the government and the Revolutionary Committee, but the negotiations failed the following day. On 8 January, in an appeal to the people of Berlin, the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies stated that &quot;force can be fought only with force. ... The hour of reckoning approaches!&quot; The USPD and KPD leadership decided to press ahead with the revolutionary overthrow of the Ebert government, but the masses were more interested in the unification of the parties of the Left. Finally, on 11 January, &quot;Freikorps&quot; forces attacked and took the building with heavy weaponry. Six parliamentarians who came out to negotiate a surrender were summarily shot. The remaining occupied buildings were taken the same day, and by 12 January the uprising was over. The death toll was estimated at 156.

The historian Eberhard Kolb calls the January Revolt the revolution&#x27;s Battle of the Marne (Germany&#x27;s July 1918 battlefield defeat that led directly to the Armistice). The 1919 uprising and its brutal end exacerbated the already deep divisions in the workers&#x27; movement and fuelled more political radicalisation.

==== Murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg ====
Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, the ringleaders of the January Revolt, were forced to go into hiding after its failure, but in spite of the urgings of their associates, they refused to leave Berlin. On the evening of 15 January 1919, the two were found by the authorities in an apartment in the Wilmersdorf district of Berlin. They were immediately arrested and handed over to the largest &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit, the heavily armed . Its commander, Captain Waldemar Pabst, had them questioned. The same night both prisoners were clubbed with the butt of a rifle and shot in the head. Karl Liebknecht&#x27;s body, without a name, was delivered to a nearby morgue. Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s body was thrown into Berlin&#x27;s Landwehr Canal, where it was found only on 1 July.

The perpetrators for the most part went unpunished. The Nazi Party later compensated the few who had been put on trial or jailed, and they merged the into the SA (). In an interview given to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1962 and in his memoirs, Pabst maintained that he had talked on the phone with Noske in the Chancellery and that Noske and Ebert had approved of his actions. Pabst&#x27;s statement was never confirmed, especially since neither the Reichstag nor the courts ever examined the case.

==== Final revolts ====

In the first months of 1919, there were additional armed revolts in parts of Germany that culminated in the Berlin March Battles. The overall cause was continued worker disappointment that the revolution had not achieved the goals they had hoped for in November 1918: nationalisation of key industries, recognition of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils and establishment of a council republic. In 1919, attaining the goals would have required the overthrow of the Ebert government. General strikes were called in Upper Silesia in January, in the Ruhr district in February and in Saxony and Thuringia in February and March.

In Berlin, members of the USPD and KPD called for a general strike that started on 4 March. Its key aims were the socialisation of major industries, democratisation of the military and the safeguarding of the position of the remaining workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils. Against the will of the leadership, the strikes escalated into street fighting. The Prussian state government, which had declared a state of siege, called on the Reich government for help. It responded with the deployment of both government and &quot;Freikorps&quot; troops. On 9 March, Gustav Noske, to whom executive power had been transferred, gave the order to shoot on sight anyone found carrying a weapon. By the end of the fighting on 16 March, the uprising had been bloodily quashed, with a death toll of at least 1,200.

Short-lived soviet republics were proclaimed in a number of cities and towns into early 1919, but only those in Bavaria (Munich) and Bremen lasted longer than a few days. They were overthrown by government and &quot;Freikorps&quot; troops with considerable loss of life: 80 in Bremen (February) and about 600 in Munich (May).

According to the predominant opinion of modern historians, the establishment of a Bolshevik-style council government in Germany following the war would have been all but impossible. The Ebert government felt threatened by a coup from the Left and was certainly undermined by the Spartacus movement. That underlay its cooperation with the Supreme Army Command and the &quot;Freikorps&quot;. The brutal actions of the &quot;Freikorps&quot; during the various revolts estranged many left democrats from the SPD. They regarded the behaviour of Ebert, Noske and the other SPD leaders during the revolution as a betrayal of their own followers.

=== National Assembly and new Reich constitution ===

On 19 January 1919, Germans voted for representatives to a constituent national assembly in an election that included women for the first time. The SPD received the highest percentage of votes (38%), and with the Catholic Centre Party and the liberal German Democratic Party, it formed the Weimar Coalition. The USPD received only 7.6% of the vote; the KPD did not participate. To remove itself from the post-revolutionary confusion in Berlin, the National Assembly met in Weimar beginning on 6 February. The Assembly elected Friedrich Ebert temporary president on 11 February and Philipp Scheidemann minister president on 13 February.

In addition to drawing up and approving a new constitution, the Assembly was responsible for passing urgently needed Reich laws. In May it found itself embroiled in the highly contentious issue of whether or not to accept the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Under intense pressure from the victorious Allies, it agreed on 16 June 1919 after Scheidemann resigned as minister president with the words, &quot;What hand should not wither that puts itself and us in these fetters?&quot; Gustav Bauer of the SPD took his place.

The Weimar Constitution was ratified by the National Assembly on 11 August and became effective three days later. It established a federal parliamentary republic (sometimes called a semi-presidential republic because of the strength of the presidency) with a comprehensive list of fundamental rights and a popularly elected Reichstag that was responsible for legislation, the budget and control of the executive. The government, headed by the chancellor, was dependent on the confidence of the Reichstag. The president, who was elected by popular vote for seven years, could dissolve the Reichstag and under Article 48 had the power to declare a state of emergency and issue emergency decrees when public security was threatened.

In October 1922, the Reichstag lengthened Ebert&#x27;s term of office until 23 June 1925. He died in office a few months before then, and Paul von Hindenburg was elected the second and last president of the Republic. His use of Article 48 was instrumental in paving the way for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power.

== Aftermath ==


From 1920 to 1923, both nationalist and left-wing forces continued fighting against the Weimar Republic. In March 1920, a coup organized by Wolfgang Kapp (the Kapp Putsch) attempted to overthrow the government, but the venture collapsed within a few days under the effects of a general strike and the refusal of government employees to obey Kapp. Members of the ultra-nationalist Organisation Consul assassinated former minister of finance Matthias Erzberger in 1921 and Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau in 1922. The recently formed Nazi Party, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, in what is now known as the Beer Hall Putsch, planned to take over the government of Bavaria, march to Berlin and seize control of the Reich government. Their attempt, made on 9 November 1923, was stopped in Munich by the local police, Hitler was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released in less than a year.

In the wake of the Kapp Putsch, civil war-like fighting broke out with the Ruhr uprising when the Ruhr Red Army, made up of some 50,000 armed workers, mostly adherents of the KPD and USPD, used the disruption caused by the putsch to take control of the regions&#x27; industrial district. After bloody battles in which an estimated 1,000 insurgents and 200 soldiers died, &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and &quot;Freikorps&quot; units suppressed the revolt in early April. In the March Action of 1921, the KPD, the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany (KAPD) and other far-left organisations attempted a communist uprising in the industrial regions of central Germany. It was quashed by government troops.

From 1924 to 1929, the Weimar Republic was relatively stable. The period, known in Germany as the &quot;&quot; (Golden Twenties), was marked by internal consolidation and rapprochement in foreign affairs along with a growing economy and a consequent decrease in civil unrest.

The Weimar Republic was always under great pressure from both left-wing and right-wing extremists. The radical left-wing accused the ruling Social Democrats of having betrayed the ideals of the workers&#x27; movement by preventing a communist revolution and unleashing the &quot;Freikorps&quot; on the workers. Right-wing extremists were opposed to any democratic system, preferring instead an authoritarian state similar to the German Empire. To further undermine the Republic&#x27;s credibility, far-right extremists (especially certain members of the former officer corps) used the stab-in-the-back myth to blame an alleged conspiracy of communists, socialists and Jews for Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I. Both sides were determined to bring down the Weimar Republic. In the end, the right-wing extremists were successful, and the Weimar Republic came to an end with the ascent of Hitler and the National Socialist Party.

== Impact on the Weimar Republic ==
The Revolution of 1918/19 is one of the most important events in the modern history of Germany, yet it is poorly embedded in the historical memory of Germans. The failure of the Weimar Republic that the revolution brought into being and the Nazi era that followed it obstructed the view of the events for a long time.

Both the radical Right and the radical Leftunder different circumstancesnurtured the idea that a communist uprising was aiming to establish a soviet republic following the Russian example. The democratic centre parties, especially the SPD, were also only minimally interested in fairly assessing the events which turned Germany into a republic. At closer look, the events turned out to be a revolution supported by the social democrats and stopped by their party leadership. The processes helped to weaken the Weimar Republic from its very beginning.

After the Reich government and the Supreme Command refused at an early stage to acknowledge their responsibilities for the war and the defeat, the majority parties of the Reichstag were left to cope with the resulting burdens. In his autobiography, Ludendorff&#x27;s successor Groener states, &quot;It suited me just fine when the army and the Supreme Command remained as guiltless as possible in these wretched truce negotiations, from which nothing good could be expected&quot;.

Thus, the &quot;Myth of the Stab in the Back&quot; was born, according to which the revolutionaries stabbed the army, &quot;undefeated on the field&quot;, in the back and only then turned the almost secure victory into a defeat. It was mainly Ludendorff who contributed to the spread of the falsification of history to conceal his own role in the defeat. In nationalist circles, the myth fell on fertile ground. They soon defamed the revolutionaries and even politicians like Ebert, who never wanted the revolution and had done everything to channel and contain it, as &quot;November Criminals&quot;. In 1923, Hitler and Ludendorff deliberately chose the symbolic 9 November as the date of their attempted &quot;Beer Hall Putsch&quot;.

From its very beginning, the Weimar Republic was afflicted with the stigma of the military defeat. A large part of the bourgeoisie and the old elites from industry, landowners, the military, judiciary and administration never accepted the democratic republic and hoped to replace it at the first opportunity. On the Left, the actions of the SPD leadership during the revolution drove many of its former adherents to the Communists. The incomplete revolution gave birth to what some have called a &quot;democracy without democrats&quot;.

== Contemporary statements ==
Depending on their political standpoint, contemporaries had greatly differing opinions about the revolution.

Ernst Troeltsch, a Protestant theologian and philosopher, rather calmly remarked how the majority of Berlin citizens perceived 10 November:
On Sunday morning, after a frightful night, the morning newspapers gave a clear picture: the Emperor in Holland, the revolution victorious in most urban centres, the royals in the states abdicating. No man dead for Emperor and Empire! The continuation of duties ensured and no run on the banks! (...) Trams and subways ran as usual, which is a pledge that basic needs are cared for. On all faces it could be read: Wages will continue to be paid.

Lending himself to far too optimistic illusions, which the SPD leadership also might have had, the liberal journalist Theodor Wolff wrote on 10 November in the newspaper &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot;:
Like a sudden storm, the biggest of all revolutions has toppled the imperial regime, including everything that belonged to it. It can be called the greatest of all revolutions because never has a more firmly built (...) fortress been taken in this manner at the first attempt. Only one week ago, there was still a military and civil administration so deeply rooted that it seemed to have secured its dominion beyond the change of times. (...) Only yesterday morning, at least in Berlin, all this still existed. Yesterday afternoon it was all gone.

The extreme Right had a completely opposite perception. On 10 November, conservative journalist Paul Baecker wrote an article in which already contained essential elements of the &quot;stab-in-the-back myth&quot;:
The work fought for by our fathers with their precious blood – dismissed by betrayal in the ranks of our own people! Germany, yesterday still undefeated, left to the mercy of our enemies by men carrying the German name, by felony out of our own ranks broken down in guilt and shame.&lt;br&gt;The German socialists knew that peace was at hand anyway and that it was only a matter of holding out against the enemy for a few days or weeks in order to wrest bearable conditions from them. In this situation they raised the white flag.&lt;br&gt;This is a sin that can never be forgiven and never will be forgiven. This is treason not only against the monarchy and the army but also against the German people themselves who will have to bear the consequences in centuries of decline and of misery.

In an article on the 10th anniversary of the revolution, the journalist Kurt Tucholsky remarked that neither Wolff nor Baecker were right. Nevertheless, Tucholsky accused Ebert and Noske of betrayal, not of the monarchy but of the revolution. Although he wanted to regard it as only a coup d&#x27;état, he analysed the course of events more clearly than most of his contemporaries. In 1928 he wrote in &quot;November Coup&quot;:
The German Revolution of 1918 took place in a hall.

The things taking place were not a revolution. There was no spiritual preparation, no leaders ready in the dark; no revolutionary goals. The mother of this revolution was the soldiers&#x27; longing to be home for Christmas. And weariness, disgust and weariness.&lt;br&gt;The possibilities that nevertheless were lying in the streets were betrayed by Ebert and his like. Fritz* Ebert, whom you cannot heighten to a personality by calling him Friedrich, opposed the establishment of a republic only until he found there was a post of chairman to be had; comrade Scheidemann è tutti quanti, all were would-be senior civil servants. (* Fritz is the colloquial term for Friedrich like Willy is for William.)

The following possibilities were left out: shattering federal states, division of landed property, revolutionary socialization of industry, reform of administrative and judiciary personnel. A republican constitution in which every sentence rescinds the next one, a revolution talking about well-acquired rights of the old regime, can be only laughed at.

&quot;The German Revolution is still to take place.&quot;

Walther Rathenau was of a similar opinion. He called the revolution a &quot;disappointment&quot;, a &quot;present by chance&quot;, a &quot;product of desperation&quot;, a &quot;revolution by mistake&quot;. It did not deserve the name because it did &quot;not abolish the actual mistakes&quot; but &quot;degenerated into a degrading clash of interests&quot;.

Not a chain was broken by the swelling of spirit and will, only a lock merely rusted through. The chain fell off and the freed stood amazed, helpless, embarrassed and needed to arm against their will. The ones sensing their advantage were the quickest.

The historian Sebastian Haffner in turn came out against Tucholsky and Rathenau. He lived through the revolution in Berlin as a child and wrote 50 years later in his book about one of the myths related to the events of November 1918 that had taken root especially in the bourgeoisie:

It is often said that a true revolution in Germany in 1918 never took place. All that really happened was a breakdown. It was only the temporary weakness of the police and army in the moment of military defeat which let a mutiny of sailors appear as a revolution.
&lt;br&gt;At first sight, one can see how wrong and blind it is comparing 1918 with 1945. In 1945 there really was a breakdown.&lt;br&gt;Certainly a mutiny of sailors started the revolution in 1918 but it was only a start. What made it extraordinary is that a mere sailors&#x27; mutiny triggered an earthquake which shook all of Germany; that the whole home army, the whole urban workforce and in Bavaria a part of the rural population rose up in revolt. This revolt was not just a mutiny anymore, it was a true revolution...&lt;br&gt;As in any revolution, the old order was replaced by the beginnings of a new one. It was not just destructive but also creative...&lt;br&gt;As a revolutionary achievement of masses the German November 1918 does not need to take second place to either the French July 1789 or the Russian March 1917.

=== Historical research ===
During the Nazi regime, works on the Weimar Republic and the German revolution published abroad and by exiles could not be read in Germany. Around 1935, that affected the first published history of the Weimar Republic by Arthur Rosenberg. In his view, the political situation at the beginning of the revolution was open: the moderate socialist and democratically oriented workforce had a chance to become the social foundation of the republic and to drive back the conservative forces. It failed because of bad decisions by the SPD leadership and because of the revolutionary tactics employed by the extreme left wing of the workforce.

After 1945, West German historical research on the Weimar Republic concentrated most of all on its decline. In 1951, Theodor Eschenburg mostly ignored the revolutionary beginning of the republic. In 1955, Karl Dietrich Bracher also dealt with the German revolution from the perspective of the failed republic. Erich Eyck shows how little the revolution after 1945 was regarded as part of German history. His two-volume &quot;History of the Weimar Republic&quot; gave barely 20 pages to the events. The same can be said for Karl Dietrich Erdmann&#x27;s contribution to the 8th edition of the &quot;Gebhardt Handbook for German History&quot; (), whose viewpoint dominated the interpretation of events related to the German revolution after 1945. According to Erdmann, 1918/19 was about the choice between &quot;social revolution in line with forces demanding a proletarian dictatorship and parliamentary republic in line with the conservative elements like the German officer corps&quot;. As most Social Democrats were forced to join with the old elites to prevent an imminent council dictatorship, the blame for the failure of the Weimar Republic was to be put on the extreme Left, and the events of 1918/19 were successful defensive actions of democracy against Bolshevism.

This interpretation at the height of the Cold War was based on the assumption that the extreme Left was comparably strong and a real threat to the democratic development. On this point, West German researchers ironically found themselves in line with Marxist historiography in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), which attributed considerable revolutionary potential most of all to the Spartacists.

While in the postwar years the majority SPD (MSPD) was cleared of its Nazi odium as &quot;November Criminals&quot;, GDR historians blamed the SPD for &quot;betrayal of the working class&quot; and the USPD leadership for their incompetence. Their interpretation was mainly based on the 1958 theories of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany according to which the German revolution was defined as a &quot;bourgeois-democratic revolution&quot;, led in certain aspects by proletarian means and methods. The fact that a revolution by the working class in Germany never happened could be attributed to the &quot;subjective factor&quot;, especially the absence of a &quot;Marxist-Leninist offensive party&quot;. Contrary to the official party line, Rudolf Lindau supported the theory that the German revolution had a Socialist tendency.

Consistently, the founding of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany) was declared to be the decisive turning point in German history, but in spite of ideological bias, historical research in the GDR expanded detailed knowledge of the German revolution.

During the 1950s, West German historians had focused their research on the final stages of the Weimar Republic. In the 1960s, they shifted to its revolutionary beginnings, realising that the decisions and developments during the revolution were central to the failure of the first German republic. The workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils especially moved into focus, and their previous appearance as a far-left movement had to be revised extensively. Authors like Ulrich Kluge, Eberhard Kolb and Reinhard Rürup argued that in the first weeks of the revolution the social base for a democratic redesign of society was much stronger than previously thought and that the potential of the extreme Left was weaker than the SPD&#x27;s leadership, for example, assumed.

As Bolshevism posed no real threat, the scope of action for the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies (also supported by the more reform-oriented councils) to democratise the administration, military and society had been relatively large, but the SPD&#x27;s leadership did not take the step because it trusted in the loyalty of the old elites and mistrusted the spontaneous mass movements in the first weeks of the revolution. The result was the radicalisation of the council movement. The theories were supported by the publications of the minutes of the Council of the People&#x27;s Deputies. Increasingly, the history of the German revolution appeared as the history of its gradual reversal.

This new interpretation of the German revolution gained acceptance in research rather quickly even though older perceptions remained alive. Research concerning the composition of the worker&#x27;s and soldier&#x27;s councils, which today can be easily verified by sources, is undisputed to a large extent, but the interpretation of the revolutionary events based on the research has been criticised and partially modified since the end of the 1970s. Criticism was aimed at the partially idealised description of the workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils, which especially was the case in the wake of the German Student Movement of the 1960s (1968). Peter von Oertzen went particularly far in this respect, describing a social democracy based on councils as a positive alternative to the bourgeois republic. In comparison, Wolfgang J. Mommsen did not regard the councils as a homogeneous focused movement for democracy but as a heterogeneous group with a multitude of different motivations and goals. Jesse and Köhler talked about the &quot;construct of a democratic council movement&quot;. Certainly, the authors also excluded a relapse to the positions of the 1950s: &quot;The councils to a large extent were neither communist-oriented, nor can the policies of the majority SPD in every aspect be labelled fortuitous and worth praising.&quot;

Heinrich August Winkler tried to find a compromise, according to which the Social Democrats depended to a limited extent on cooperation with the old elites but went considerably too far: &quot;With more political willpower they could have changed more and preserved less.&quot;

With all the differences concerning details, historical researchers agree that in the German revolution, the chances to put the republic on a firm footing were considerably better than the dangers coming from the radical left. Instead, the alliance of the SPD with the old elites constituted a considerable structural problem for the Weimar Republic.
