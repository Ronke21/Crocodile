<text>The Vanuatu rain forests are tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion which includes the islands of Vanuatu, as well as the Santa Cruz Islands group of the neighboring Solomon Islands. It is part of the Australasian realm, which includes neighboring New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands, as well as Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand.


==Geography==
The islands were created by the subduction of the northward-moving Australian Plate beneath the Pacific Plate. The surface geology of Vanuatu consists mostly of Pliocene-Pleistocene volcanic rocks and uplifted coral limestone. The Santa Cruz Islands have areas of both uplifted limestone and volcanic ash over limestone. The oldest rocks in Vanuatu are 38 million years old. The Santa Cruz islands are younger, with the oldest rocks less than 5 million years old.

Most of the islands are low-lying. The largest island is Espiritu Santo (3,955.5 km2). The highest peak is Mount Tabwemasana on Espiritu Santo (1,879 m). 

Nendö, also known as Santa Cruz, is the largest of the Santa Cruz Islands with an area of 519 km2. Vanikoro is 190 km2, and Utupua is 69 km2. The highest peak in the Santa Cruz islands (924 m) is on Vanikoro. Nendö reaches over 500 meters elevation, and Utupua 350 m. They are made mostly of basaltic volcanic rocks of Pliocene origin, less than 5 million years old. The southeastern lowlands of Nendö are composed of uplifted Pleistocene reef limestone.

Smaller islands in the group include Tinakula (8 km2 and 800 meters elevation), a conical active stratovolcano 30 km north of Nendö, and the Reef Islands northeast of Nendö, composed of uplifted Pleistocene reef limestone and rising only 5 meters above sea level. The Duff Islands are a small chain with four main islands about 130 km northeast of Nendö, with a combined area of 14 km2 and which rise up to 300 m elevation. Tikopia (5 km2), Anuta (1 km2), and Fataka (5 km2) are small isolated islands east and southeast of Vanikoro.

==Climate==
The ecoregion has a tropical wet climate. The windward southeastern sides of the islands receive more rainfall. The leeward northwestern slopes of islands have a distinct dry season between April and October. Tropical cyclones occur regularly.

==Flora==
The natural plant communities on the islands include lowland rain forest, montane rain forest, seasonal forest and scrub, coastal strand, mangroves, vegetation on recent volcanic rocks, and secondary vegetation.

Lowland rain forest occurs on the southeastern, or windward, sides of Vanuatu&#x27;s islands. There are several lowland rain forest types. Complex forest scrub densely covered with lianas is the most widespread forest type on the larger northern islands. Other types include high- and medium-stature forests, alluvial and floodplain forests, and mixed-species forests without conifers. &quot;Agathis-Calophyllum&quot; lowland forest is found on the southern islands of Erromango and Aneityum.

Lowland rainforest is the predominant plant community on the Santa Cruz Islands, and has some differences from the lowland rain forests on the islands further south. Typical species include &quot;Campnosperma brevipetiolatum, Calophyllum vitiense, Gmelina salomonensis, Maranthes corymbosa, Falcataria falcata, Pterocarpus indicus&quot;, and &quot;Endospermum medullosum&quot;. There is no well-developed montane forest, but the trees &quot;Metrosideros vitiensis, Syzygium branderhorstii, Syzygium buettnerianum, Syzygium effusum, Syzygium myriadenum&quot;, and &quot;Syzygium onesimum&quot;, and the conifers &quot;Agathis macrophylla&quot; and &quot;Retrophyllum vitiense&quot;, which are typically montane species elsewhere, grow in the islands&#x27; lowland forests. &quot;Agathis macrophylla&quot; grows only on Nendö and Vanikoro, and is found on ridges and slopes as an emergent tree in mixed forests or in monotypic stands.

In Vanuatu, montane rain forests extent from as low as 500 meters elevation up to patches of stunted cloud forest on the islands&#x27; highest peaks. They include the conifers &quot;Agathis macrophylla&quot; and &quot;Dacrycarpus imbricatus&quot;, together with broadleaf evergreen trees &quot;Metrosideros vitiensis, Syzygium&quot; spp., &quot;Pterophylla&quot; spp., &quot;Geissois&quot; spp., &quot;Quintinia&quot; spp., and &quot;Ascarina&quot; spp. The tree ferns &quot;Cyathea&quot; and &quot;Dickinsonia&quot; are common, and the endemic palm &quot;Clinostigma harlandii&quot; is found on the islands Ambrym, Aneityum, and Erromango. &quot;Podocarpus vanuatuensis&quot; is a Vanuatu endemic, native to Aneityum and Erromango. &quot;Agathis silbae&quot; is endemic to the Cumberland Peninsula and Mount Tabwemasana, also known as Santo Peak, on the west coast of Espiritu Santo, from 450 to 760 meters elevation. It is a large emergent tree in lower montain rainforest on the wetter western and northwestern slopes of Espiritu Santo&#x27;s central mountain range, with an average annual rainfall of about 4,500 mm. Associated trees include &quot;Calophyllum neo-ebudicum, Cryptocarya turbinata, Didymocheton&quot; sp., &quot;Myristica&quot; sp., and &quot;Podocarpus&quot; sp. &quot;Metrosideros tabwemasanaensis&quot; is a tree endemic to the montane forests of Mount Tabwemasana.

Seasonal forest, scrub, and grassland grow on the leeward sides of the islands. Semideciduous &quot;Kleinhovia hospita-Castanospermum australe&quot; forests are a transition between rain forest and dry forest, and include some rain forest species. Forest of gaiac (&quot;Acacia spirorbis&quot;) is found in drier areas, with a canopy up to 15 meters high. Thickets and savannas of the introduced tree &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot; and grasslands are also found on the leeward sides of the islands.

Littoral forests include &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia, Pandanus&quot; spp., &quot;Barringtonia asiatica, Terminalia catappa, Hernandia&quot; spp., and &quot;Thespesia populnea&quot;.

Coastal mangrove forests are found on some islands, and contain species of &quot;Rhizophora, Avicennia, Sonneratia, Xylocarpus&quot;, and &quot;Ceriops&quot;.

==Fauna==
Bats are the only native mammals in the ecoregion. There are twelve species – four megabats and eight microbats – five of which are endemic. The four megabats – Vanuatu flying fox (&quot;Pteropus anetianus&quot;), Temotu flying fox (&quot;Pteropus nitendiensis&quot;), Vanikoro flying fox (&quot;Pteropus tuberculatus&quot;), and Banks flying fox (&quot;Pteropus fundatus&quot;) – are endemic. Native microchiroptera include the Fijian blossom bat (&quot;Notopteris macdonaldi&quot;), Fijian mastiff bat (&quot;Chaerephon bregullae&quot;), Pacific sheath-tailed bat (&quot;Emballonura semicaudata&quot;), large-footed bat (&quot;Myotis adversus&quot;), little bent-wing bat (&quot;Miniopterus australis&quot;), great bent-winged bat (&quot;Miniopterus tristis&quot;), Temminck&#x27;s trident bat (&quot;Aselliscus tricuspidatus&quot;), and fawn leaf-nosed bat (&quot;Hipposideros cervinus&quot;). The endemic Nendo tube-nosed fruit bat (&quot;Nyctimene sanctacrucis&quot;) is presumed extinct.

The Pacific boa (&quot;Candoia bibroni&quot;), also known as Bibron’s bevel-headed boa, the Solomon Islands boa, or the Pacific ground boa (among several other names), is native to the island and surrounding region. It is unique among Boidae snakes for its “bevel” or “spade”-shaped snout, used for digging; perhaps the closest comparable species would be the Kenyan sand boa, which spends much of its time burrowing, where it will lie in wait to ambush its passing prey above.

There are 79 native bird species in Vanuatu. Fifteen species are endemic – Vanuatu scrubfowl (&quot;Megapodius layardi&quot;), Santa Cruz ground-dove (&quot;Gallicolumba sanctaecrucis&quot;), Tanna ground-dove (&quot;Gallicolumba ferruginea&quot;), Tanna fruit-dove (&quot;Ptilinopus tannensis&quot;), Baker&#x27;s imperial pigeon (&quot;Ducula bakeri&quot;), palm lorikeet (&quot;Charmosyna palmarum&quot;), chestnut-bellied kingfisher (&quot;Todirhamphus farquhari&quot;), Vanikoro monarch (&quot;Mayrornis schistaceus&quot;), buff-bellied monarch (&quot;Neolalage banksiana&quot;), black-throated shrikebill (&quot;Clytorhynchus nigrogularis&quot;), Vanikoro flycatcher (&quot;Myiagra vanikorensis&quot;), Santa Cruz white-eye (&quot;Zosterops santaecrucis&quot;), yellow-fronted white-eye (&quot;Zosterops flavifrons&quot;), Sanford&#x27;s white-eye (&quot;Woodfordia lacertosa&quot;), 
New Hebrides honeyeater (&quot;Phylidonyris notabilis&quot;), royal parrotfinch (&quot;Erythrura regia&quot;), Polynesian starling (&quot;Aplonis tabuensis&quot;), rusty-winged starling (&quot;Aplonis zelandica&quot;), and Mountain starling (&quot;Aplonis santovestris&quot;). The ecoregion corresponds to the Vanuatu and Temotu endemic bird area.

<text>Ray-Ban is a brand of luxury sunglasses and eyeglasses created in 1936 by Bausch &amp; Lomb. The brand is best known for its Wayfarer and Aviator lines of sunglasses. In 1999, Bausch &amp; Lomb sold the brand to Italian eyewear conglomerate Luxottica Group for a reported $640 million.

In 2025 ASAP Rocky was appointed the brand&#x27;s first-ever creative director.
==History==
In 1929, US Army Air Corps Colonel John A. Macready worked with Bausch &amp; Lomb, a Rochester, New York–based medical equipment manufacturer, to create aviation sunglasses that would reduce the distraction for pilots caused by the intense blue and white hues of the sky.

Specifically, Macready was concerned that pilots&#x27; goggles would fog up, greatly reducing visibility at high altitude. The prototype, created in 1936 and known as &quot;Anti-Glare&quot;, had plastic frames and green lenses that could cut out the glare without obscuring vision. The name &quot;Ray-Ban&quot; was hence derived from the ability of these glasses to limit the ingress of either ultra-violet or infra-red rays of light. Impact-resistant lenses were added in 1938. The sunglasses were redesigned with a metal frame the following year and patented as the Ray-Ban Aviator. According to the BBC, the glasses used &quot;Kalichrome lenses designed to sharpen details and minimise haze by filtering out blue light, making them ideal for misty conditions.&quot;

==Product lines==
Ray-Ban&#x27;s most popular sunglasses are the Wayfarer, Erika, and Aviator models. During the 1950s, Ray-Ban released the Echelon (Caravan), which had a squarer frame. In 1965, the Olympian I and II were introduced; they became popular when Peter Fonda wore them in the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. The company has also produced special edition lines, such as The General in 1987, bearing similarity to the original aviators worn by General Douglas MacArthur during the Second World War.
In the 1980s the Ray-Ban Clubmaster was added to the model line. The Clubmaster has a browline frame and went on to become the third best selling sunglasses style of the 1980s, behind the Wayfarer and Aviator. 

In 2007, Luxottica Group launched Ray-Ban Youth, a collection of prescription eyewear aimed at children ages eight through twelve. Modeled after popular adult Ray-Bans styles, these hypoallergenic titanium frames featured both neutral and bold colorways as well as sturdy flex hinges.

In 2009, Luxottica released the Ray-Ban Tech collection, which included the Carbon Fibre line. This line of sunglasses were factory stress-tested and designed to be durable and lightweight, and featured polarized lenses of polycarbonate or crystal.

On the brand&#x27;s website, Ray-Ban also offers the option to customize and purchase individual pairs of many of their popular styles, giving buyers express choice between frames, lenses, and engraving, among other options.

In 2021, Ray-Ban commercialized a model of smart glasses that they developed with Facebook Reality Labs called Ray-Ban Stories. Building on recent trends of wearable technology, the glasses feature a built-in camera and Bluetooth earphones. Like other wearable, camera-equipped tech, Ray-Ban Stories have come under scrutiny for their susceptibility to privacy issues and potential for misuse.

== Counterfeits ==
Like other luxury brands, Ray-Ban has been a notable target for retail counterfeiters. The advertisement of Ray-Bans for unrealistically low prices has been consistently linked to fraudulent websites peddling counterfeit products. Studies have shown that one of every four ads for discounted luxury products on Facebook links users to such sites. Ray-Bans are often involved in international seizures of counterfeit designer goods. For one example, in 2016, law enforcement in Thailand seized an alleged import of hundreds of thousands of counterfeit sunglasses including Ray-Bans and Oakleys (also owned by Luxottica Group). Counterfeiters were said to have applied tags and stickers to the fakes to deceive consumers about their authenticity.

Luxottica has taken measures to thwart the trade of counterfeit products, such as converting the India Ray-Ban website from a reference site to functional e-commerce platform, and pursuing legal action against online retailers that market fake Ray-Ban products. In 2016, Luxottica introduced a &quot;Minimum Advertised Price (MAP)&quot; policy for Ray-Ban in contracts with their wholesale customers. While the policy does not name a specific minimum price point, it forbids the advertisement of Ray-Ban products at extreme discounts, as well as any advertising that could otherwise devalue the products.

<text>Francis Morgan Ayodélé Thompson, (born 30 July 1958), better known as Daley Thompson, is an English former decathlete. He won the decathlon gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984, and broke the world record for the event four times. He was unbeaten in competition for nine years.

With four world records, two Olympic gold medals, three Commonwealth titles and wins in the World and European Championships, Thompson is considered by many to be one of the greatest decathletes of all time. Robert Chalmers described him as &quot;the greatest all-round athlete this country has ever produced.&quot; His autobiography, &quot;Daley: Olympic Superstar&quot;, was published in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Thompson was born in Notting Hill, London, the second son of a British Nigerian father, Frank Thompson, who ran a minicab firm, and Scottish mother, Lydia, from Dundee. When Thompson was six, his father left home. At seven years old, Lydia sent Thompson to Farney Close Boarding School, Bolney, Sussex, which he described as &quot;a place for troubled children&quot;. When Thompson was eleven or twelve, his father was shot dead in Streatham by the husband of a woman whom the father and a friend had dropped off. Thompson&#x27;s forename is a contraction of &quot;Ayodelé&quot;, a Yoruba word meaning &quot;joy comes home&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s first ambition was to become a professional footballer, but he later switched his interests to athletics.

==Athletics==

===Early career===
Initially, he was a member of Haywards Heath Harriers, but when he returned to London in 1975 he joined the Newham and Essex Beagles Athletics club, training as a sprinter. He began to be coached by Bob Mortimer, who suggested he try out for the decathlon because one of his decathletes had chickenpox. He competed in his first decathlon later that year in Cwmbran, Wales, which he won along with his next competition. In 1976, he won the AAA title and was 18 at the Montréal Olympic Games. The following year, he won the European Junior title and in 1978 came the first of his three Commonwealth titles. In 1979, he failed to finish in his only decathlon of that year, but won the long jump at the UK Championships.

===1980–1986: Breaking records===
Thompson opened the 1980 Olympic season with a world decathlon record of 8,648 points at Götzis, Austria, in May, and followed this by winning gold at the Moscow Olympics. After a quiet 1981 season, he was in top form in 1982; back at Götzis in May, he raised the world record to 8,730 points and then in September, at the European Championships in Athens, he took the record up to 8,774 points. The following month in Brisbane, Thompson took his second Commonwealth title.

In 1983, Thompson won the inaugural World Championships and became the first decathlete to hold a continental title, in his case the European title and the World and Olympic titles simultaneously. He also became by virtue of his World title, the first athlete in any athletics event to hold Olympic, World, continental and Commonwealth Games titles in a single event simultaneously.

Thompson spent much of the summer of 1984 in California preparing for the defence of his Olympic title, with Jürgen Hingsen, the West German who had succeeded Thompson as the world record holder, expected to be a major threat. Thompson took the lead in the first event, a lead he never relinquished throughout the competition. It seemed that, by easing off in the 1,500 metres, he had missed tying the world record by just one point. When the photo-finish pictures were examined, however, it was found that Thompson should have been credited with one more point in the 110 metres hurdles so he had in fact, equalled Hingsen&#x27;s record. 

When the new scoring tables were introduced, Thompson became the sole record holder once more with a recalculated score of 8,847 points – a world record that stood until 1992, when it was surpassed by the American athlete Dan O&#x27;Brien with a score of 8,891. Thompson&#x27;s two victories in the Olympic decathlon are a feat shared only with the Americans Bob Mathias and Ashton Eaton. Thompson&#x27;s 1984 performance is still the UK record. In 2002, Thompson&#x27;s successful defence of his Olympic title was ranked number 34 on Channel 4&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.

===1987–1990: Defeat and injury===
Thompson won his third Commonwealth title in 1986 and also won another European Championship but after that he never quite recaptured the excellent form of earlier years. In 1987, he suffered his first decathlon defeat for nine years when he finished ninth in the World Championships, and at his fourth Olympics in Seoul in 1988 he finished fourth. He made the Commonwealth Games team for the fourth time in 1990 but was forced to withdraw because of injury.

===Rivalry with Jürgen Hingsen===
Thompson&#x27;s rivalry with West German athlete Jürgen Hingsen was legendary in the sport throughout the 1980s. The pair constantly traded world records, but Thompson always had the upper hand in the major events, remaining undefeated in all competitions for nine years between 1978 and 1987.

===Promotional activities===
Thompson was also well known for his appearances in commercials for the drink Lucozade in the 1980s. Thompson&#x27;s name was used for three officially licensed home computer games by Ocean Software in the 1980s: &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot;, &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Supertest&quot; and &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Olympic Challenge&quot;. He is also a brand ambassador for a travel agency network &quot;Not Just Travel&quot;.

==After athletics==
Thompson was forced to retire from athletics in 1992, due to a persistent hamstring injury. In the 1990s, he briefly played reserve team football for Mansfield Town and played one first-team game for Non-League side Stevenage F.C. before having a short spell at Non-League side Ilkeston F.C. 

He also worked as fitness coach for Wimbledon F.C. and Luton Town football clubs. He also took part in motorsport, entering the Ford Credit Fiesta Challenge Championship in 1994. Thompson worked as a fitness trainer and motivational speaker, as well as appearing at corporate events. In 1994 Thompson trained with Reading Football Club and scored in a friendly against Leatherhead.

Thompson was an ambassador for the London 2012 Summer Olympics, focusing during the bid stage on highlighting the benefits that hosting the Olympics would bring to education and sport in schools. He also took part in the 2011 TV series &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Dream School&quot;.

In 2015, Thompson opened his own gym, Daley Fitness, located on Upper Richmond Road in London. In 2018, he joined Masterchef Gary Barnshaw and co founded DT10 Sports, creating and selling a range of low-sugar protein shakes and sports bars.

==Public persona==
Thompson was a natural showman who endeared himself to the British public with his irreverent personality and anti-establishment attitude. He won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 1982, was appointed an MBE in the 1983 New Year Honours and promoted to the CBE in the 2000 New Year Honours.

At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Thompson, who had just won his second Olympic decathlon gold medal, wore a T-shirt that read &quot;IS THE WORLD&#x27;S 2ND GREATEST ATHLETE GAY?&quot;. United States sprinter Carl Lewis had been dealing with rumours of homosexuality and the shirt was regarded as being cruelly directed at Lewis. &quot;The second athlete could be anybody, Carl Lewis, anybody,&quot; Thompson stated.

In 2012, Thompson was accused of anti-Irish sentiment after commenting on live BBC TV that the creator of a misspelled tattoo &quot;must have been Irish&quot;. The tattoo artist was actually American.

In August 2014, Thompson was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In 2015, Thompson co-presented the mid morning show on talkSPORT once a week alongside Colin Murray until Murray quit the station the following year.

==Personal life==
Thompson has two children with his girlfriend Lisa and three with ex-wife Tish. Thompson has sporting sons Elliot and Alex. Elliot Thompson became the national decathlon champion at the 2022 British Athletics Championships. The title was won 46 years after Daley claimed his first national title. Alex plays rugby for the University of Bath and England Sevens.

His autobiography, &quot;Daley: Olympic Superstar&quot;, was published by Chiselbury in 2024. A documentary film about his life, also titled &quot;Daley: Olympic Superstar&quot;, became available on the BBC in July 2024.

<text>You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown is a 1967 musical with music and lyrics by Clark Gesner and (in a 1999 revision) Andrew Lippa. It is based on the characters created by cartoonist Charles M. Schulz in his comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. The musical has been a popular choice for amateur theatre productions because of its small cast and simple staging.

== Background ==
John Gordon was credited with the book of the show, but according to Gesner&#x27;s foreword in the published script, &quot;John Gordon&quot; is a collective pseudonym that covers Gesner, the cast members, and the production staff, all of whom worked together to assemble the script. &quot;The Guide to Musical Theatre&quot; notes that &quot;John Gordon is a pseudonym for the staff and cast of the show. The original cast included Bob Balaban, Gary Burghoff, Bill Hinnant, Skip Hinnant, Karen Johnson and Reva Rose.&quot;

== History ==
During the early 1960s, Gesner had begun writing songs based on Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot; Peanuts&quot; characters, but was unable to get permission from United Feature Syndicate to use the characters in his songs. Eventually Gesner sent Schulz a demo recording of some of the songs and Gesner soon had permission to properly record them, which he did in 1966. Orson Bean sang the role of Charlie Brown, Clark Gesner sang Linus, Barbara Minkus sang Lucy, and Bill Hinnant sang Snoopy (he reprised his role in the Off-Broadway production).

At the time, Gesner had no plans for a musical based on this pre-production &quot;concept album&quot;. However, producer Arthur Whitelaw, who would later go on to write another musical based on &quot;Peanuts&quot; entitled: &quot;Snoopy! The Musical&quot;, encouraged Gesner to turn the album into a musical.

The stage adaptation of the concept album, titled &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, went into rehearsal in New York City on February 10, 1967. Prior to its opening, the musical had no actual libretto; it was several vignettes with a musical number for each one.

==Productions==
===Original New York productions and U.S. tours===

On March 7, 1967, the musical premiered off-Broadway at Theatre 80 in the East Village, featuring Gary Burghoff as Charlie Brown, Skip Hinnant as Schroeder, Reva Rose as Lucy, Bob Balaban as Linus, Karen Johnson as Patty (an early &quot;Peanuts&quot; character not to be confused with Peppermint Patty), and Bill Hinnant as Snoopy. Joseph Hardy directed and choreographer Patricia Birch was billed as &quot;Assistant to the Director&quot;. Joe Raposo, later of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; fame, was billed as &quot;Music Director&quot; and composer of incidental music for the show. This production of &quot;You&#x27;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; lasted 1,597 performances, closing on February 14, 1971.

===1998 U.S. tour and 1999 Broadway revival===
A U.S. tour began on November 18, 1998, in Skokie, Illinois. The tour was expected to become a full-scale revival to open at the Longacre Theatre on Broadway, but was moved to the Ambassador Theatre after &quot;Bring in &#x27;Da Noise, Bring in &#x27;Da Funk&quot;″s closing. After the tour ended on January 17, 1999, the revival opened on February 4, 1999, and closed on June 13, 1999, having played 14 previews and 149 performances. It featured new dialogue by Michael Mayer, who also directed, and additional songs and orchestration written by Andrew Lippa; choreography was by Jerry Mitchell and sets by David Gallo, Mayer&#x27;s frequent collaborator.

In this revival, the character of Patty was replaced with Sally Brown, inspired by the same change Schulz made in the animated TV adaptation. The cast featured Anthony Rapp as Charlie Brown, B.D. Wong as Linus, Ilana Levine as Lucy, and Stanley Wayne Mathis as Schroeder. Also featured were Kristin Chenoweth and Roger Bart as Sally and Snoopy, with each winning the Tony award in the respective category. Kirsten Wyatt was the standby for Lucy and Sally.

The original Broadway revival recording was released by RCA Victor/BMG on March 9, 1999.

The 1999 cast appeared on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot; to promote the show, singing &quot;Beethoven Day.&quot; O&#x27;Donnell joined in with the cast to close her show by performing the finale as the credits rolled.

==Synopsis==
===Original===
;Act I
Charlie Brown and Linus are together, as his friends give their various opinions of him (&quot;Opening&quot;). Today everyone is calling him a &quot;good man&quot;. They state he could be king. Lucy, however says he could be king if he wasn&#x27;t so wishy-washy (&quot;You&#x27;re A Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;). Lucy expresses her deep infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: &quot;My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician&quot; (&quot;Schroeder&quot;).

Schroeder is walking around in the sun, happy with all the peace and quiet. However, that is soon interrupted by Lucy screaming for a ball. Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse, relaxing vacantly and peacefully. He daydreams that all the children are adoring him, and saying he&#x27;s “the best dog in the world”. Birds start to poke his stomach, and then he begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state (&quot;Snoopy&quot;).

Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Patty show up and mock him for this habit. Lucy tries to pull away the blanket, but fails. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus decides to relax with his blanket until he can outgrow it (&quot;My Blanket and Me&quot;). Charlie Brown appears, trying to get his unusually stubborn kite to soar in the air. Eventually, he succeeds in doing this, and he enjoys a few minutes of triumph before the kite plummets to the ground (&quot;The Kite&quot;).

After this trauma, Charlie Brown tries to find the right way to give The Little Red-Headed Girl her Valentine&#x27;s Day card, but he ends up saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, making a fool out of himself. He finds Patty handing out valentines, and she drops a valentine with the initials C.B. Charlie Brown gives it back to Patty, but soon learns it was Craig Bowerman&#x27;s valentine. He goes to see Lucy, who is at her psychiatrist booth. He tells her all the things he thinks of himself. Lucy then clears it up by saying that Charlie Brown is unique the way he is, then asks for the five cent price (&quot;The Doctor Is In&quot;).

Later, Lucy comes up to Schroeder again and talks about if they got married, and they were so poor that Schroeder had to sell his piano for saucepans, and, again, Schroeder cannot stand it. At noon, Linus, Lucy, Schroeder, and Charlie Brown are working on their Peter Rabbit book reports, each in his or her own way. Lucy is simply babbling to fit the 100-word requirement, Schroeder is doing a &quot;comparison&quot; between the book and Robin Hood, Linus is doing an overcomplicated psychological analysis, and Charlie Brown hasn&#x27;t even started out of worry (&quot;The Book Report&quot;).

;Act II
Snoopy, in his World War I flying ace uniform, climbs atop his doghouse. He goes through a scene, with him being a pilot searching for the Red Baron. In his imagination, he is defeated by the Red Baron and returns to the aerodrome in France (&quot;The Red Baron&quot;). Meanwhile, Charlie Brown returns, and, with his friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages to make some progress. Charlie Brown steps up to the plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn that this was a flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal (&quot;T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)&quot;).

Later on, Linus and Lucy arrive home. Linus starts to watch TV, but Lucy tells him to switch channels. Lucy tells Linus that what she intends to do when she grows up, she will become a queen. Linus denies, and Lucy decides to cultivate her life for her &quot;natural beauty&quot; (&quot;Queen Lucy&quot;). The next day, at lunchtime, Charlie Brown talks about his bad days. Then he notices the Little Red-Haired Girl approaching and puts a paper bag over his head. It turns out it is Lucy and Patty, chatting together.

At Schroeder&#x27;s Glee Club, Patty is the only one to arrive early. When everyone comes, it&#x27;s chaos. Unfortunately, a fight ensues between Lucy and Linus over a pencil. Lucy threatens to tell Patty that Linus called her an enigma. The fight spreads, and Charlie Brown decides to leave with his angry friends, leaving Schroeder and Snoopy the only ones singing (&quot;Glee Club Rehearsal&quot;). Later, Charlie Brown comes across Lucy teaching Linus about nature the way she views it, with &quot;facts&quot; such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow coming out of the ground in winter. Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration (&quot;Little Known Facts&quot;).

The next morning, Snoopy is puzzled why he has his supper in the red dish, and the water in the blue dish. Meanwhile, Linus and Schroeder are walking to school. Schroeder asks if Linus filled out the form that Ms. Othmar gave them. Linus puts down “Dr. Seuss“. Snoopy talks about how he hates cats, but he is also scared of them (&quot;Peanuts Potpourri&quot;). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn&#x27;t been fed yet, and begins to overly complicate and dramatize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal (&quot;Suppertime&quot;).

That night, everyone is looking at the stars in wonder. Charlie Brown soon discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that &quot;there are teeth-marks all over it . . . she &quot;nibbles&quot; her pencil . . . &quot;she&#x27;s HUMAN!&quot;&quot; With that realization, he concludes that today hasn&#x27;t been so bad, after all, and he&#x27;s done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well (&quot;Happiness&quot;). Right then, he realizes being a &quot;good man&quot; means trying your best and making the most of the things you&#x27;ve been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him then tells him, &quot;You&#x27;re a good man, Charlie Brown.&quot;

===Revised===
;Act I
Charlie Brown stands alone as his friends give their various opinions of him (&quot;Opening&quot;). Today everyone is calling him a &quot;good man&quot;. Charlie Brown is happy and hopeful as usual, but he nevertheless wonders if he really is what they say. He decides to find out how he can really become a good person (&quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;).

Alone one day, during lunch, Charlie Brown talks about his bad days. Then he notices the Little Red-Haired Girl and decides to go sit with her. However, he cannot find the courage to do so, and puts a paper bag over his head. It turns out it is Lucy and Sally, chatting together. They draw a dress on the paper bag, while Charlie Brown feels like he has no confidence (&quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (reprise))

Lucy expresses her deep infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: &quot;My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician&quot; (&quot;Schroeder&quot;). Sally is sad because her jump rope tangled up.

Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse, relaxing vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state (&quot;Snoopy&quot;). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets (&quot;My Blanket and Me&quot;). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen (&quot;Queen Lucy&quot;). However, Linus tells her that she can&#x27;t and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.

Charlie Brown appears, trying to get his unusually stubborn kite to soar in the air. Eventually, he succeeds in doing this, and he enjoys a few minutes of triumph before the notorious Kite-Eating Tree eats it up (&quot;The Kite&quot;). After this trauma, Charlie Brown tries to find the right way to give Lucy a Valentine&#x27;s Day card, but he ends up saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, making a fool out of himself. He later learns that no one sent him a card, whereas everyone else, including Snoopy, got several. He goes to see Lucy, who is at her psychiatrist booth. He tells her all the things he thinks of himself. Lucy then clears it up by saying that Charlie Brown is unique the way he is, then asks for the five cent price (&quot;The Doctor Is In&quot;). Later, Charlie Brown sees a happy Schroeder spreading the word of Beethoven&#x27;s birthday and pulling together a celebration. He and company join Schroeder in the song of jubilation (&quot;Beethoven Day&quot;).

The next morning, Sally wakes up Snoopy to go rabbit chasing, and they go into strange places, like the Sahara. At noon, Linus, Lucy, Schroeder, and Charlie Brown are working on their Peter Rabbit book reports, each in their own way. Lucy is simply babbling to fit the 100-word requirement, Schroeder is doing a &quot;comparison&quot; between the book and Robin Hood, Linus is doing an overcomplicated psychological analysis, and Charlie Brown hasn&#x27;t even started out of worry, while Sally and Snoopy continue to chase rabbits (&quot;The Book Report&quot;).

;Act II
Snoopy, in his World War I flying ace uniform climbs atop his doghouse. He goes through a scene, with him being a pilot searching for the Red Baron. In his imagination, he is defeated by the Red Baron and returns to the aerodrome in France (&quot;The Red Baron&quot;).

Sally is clearly cross about a D her teacher gave her on her homework assignment. In response, she says, &quot;Oh, yeah? That&#x27;s what you think!&quot; Schroeder hears and asks why Sally is telling him that. It quickly becomes Sally&#x27;s new &quot;philosophy&quot;, and she bursts into song about her philosophies. Schroeder, after failing to explain to her how philosophies work, leaves in bafflement while Sally continues (&quot;My New Philosophy&quot;).

Charlie Brown returns, and, with his friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages to make some progress. Charlie Brown steps up to the plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn that this was a flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal (&quot;T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)&quot;). After Schroeder tells her she is a very crabby person, Lucy takes a crabbiness survey of all her friends to determine her crabbiness: Charlie Brown gives a waffling answer, while Sally is more definitive. Upon asking Linus, he refuses to answer until she promises not to punch him; when he gives her a score of ninety-five, though, she punches him anyway. After tallying the score, she realizes that she, in reality, is really very crabby and becomes depressed. Linus cheers her up by reminding her she has a little brother who loves her, remarking as she sobs in his shoulder, &quot;Every now and then I say the right thing!&quot;

Determined not to let what happened at the championship bother him, Charlie Brown decides to join Schroeder&#x27;s Glee Club and cheer up by singing &quot;Home on the Range&quot; with his friends. Unfortunately, a fight ensues between Lucy and Linus over a pencil. The fight spreads, and Charlie Brown decides to leave with his angry friends, leaving Schroeder and Snoopy the only ones singing (&quot;Glee Club Rehearsal&quot;).

Later, Charlie Brown comes across Lucy teaching Linus about nature the way she views it, with &quot;facts&quot; such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow growing out of the ground in winter. Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration (&quot;Little Known Facts&quot;). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn&#x27;t been fed yet, and begins to overly complicate and dramatize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal (&quot;Suppertime&quot;).

That night, Charlie Brown is still sad that he has not discovered what it means to be a &quot;good man&quot;, then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that &quot;there are teeth-marks all over it...she &quot;nibbles&quot; her pencil...&quot;she&#x27;s HUMAN!&quot;&quot; With that realization, he concludes that today hasn&#x27;t been so bad, after all, and he&#x27;s done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well (&quot;Happiness&quot;). Right then, he realizes being a &quot;good man&quot; means trying your best and making the most of the things you&#x27;ve been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she shakes his hand firmly, then tells him, &quot;You&#x27;re a good man, Charlie Brown.&quot;

A medley of &quot;Happiness&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; is performed as the cast comes out for a final curtain call.

==Instrumentation==

The instrumentation varies greatly and three kinds exist.

In the original Off-Broadway production, the instrumentation was simply a piano (doubling on toy piano and melodica), a bass, and percussion. It can be heard on the original cast recording.

When Tams-Witmark acquired the rights to &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, the orchestration was rewritten from the original version. The complete orchestration contained a piano, bass, guitar, percussion, five woodwind parts, two trumpets, horn, trombone, and strings. The piano player can also be doubled on celeste, toy piano, and melodica; the first woodwind plays flute and piccolo; the second is the second flute part; the third and fourth are the first and second clarinet parts respectively; the fifth on bass clarinet and tenor sax. Any guitar, horn, and string parts (excluding bass) were all optional.

When &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; was brought back to Broadway in 1999, the orchestration was deeply revised, containing a five-piece orchestra that consisted of a piano, bass, percussion, a woodwind player, and a violinist. The piano player can double on keyboard synthesizer and kazoo; the bass player doubles on electric and acoustic bass, tenor recorder, and kazoo (in the original Broadway pit the bass player also doubled on acoustic and electric guitar); the woodwind part doubles on piccolo, flute, clarinet, soprano and alto sax, soprano recorder, and kazoo; the violin part also doubles on viola, alto recorder, kazoo, and tambourine. The percussionist primarily plays drum set but doubles on vibraphone, bells, triangle, timpani, and xylophone, with the parts intended to be played with a synthesizer. This version is also available through Tams-Witmark.

==Casts==

&quot;Notes: The character of &quot;Sally&quot; was added in the 1999 revival, replacing &quot;Patty&quot; from the original version. Sally was then used for the 2016 revival as well. &lt;br&gt;The characters of Patty and Schroeder do not appear on the concept album.&quot;

Articles about the 1999 revision while it was in previews noted that the one difference between the original production and the 1999 version was that the latter reflected the increased ethnic diversity of casting over the decades that had passed, with Schroeder being played by an African American actor (Mathis) and Linus by an Asian American (Wong).

==Response==
The off-Broadway production was well received, with &quot;The Village Voice&quot; praising the simplistic set and &quot;strikingly talented&quot; cast. Walter Kerr in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show &quot;a miracle&quot;, saying, &quot;Almost everything works, because almost everything is effortless.&quot;

In reviewing the 1999 revival, &quot;Playbill&quot;&#x27;s Steven Suskin found it &quot;overblown and underwhelming. The scenic and musical enhancements were especially harmful, it seemed to me; the unassuming, child-size characters were overwhelmed… Which is not to say that the 1999 music department did a bad job; it&#x27;s simply that the concept of a big, new &#x27;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&#x27; worked against the inherent qualities of the material.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ben Brantley wrote a lukewarm review:
Brantley did praise some of the cast, saying, &quot;Kristin Chenoweth&#x27;s performance as Sally will be the part that should seal her reputation. This glow cast by a star-in-the-making gives a real Broadway magic to a show that otherwise feels sadly shrunken… And Roger Bart, in the plum role of Snoopy, the charismatic beagle, incorporates some delightful doglike mannerisms.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
===Original Off-Broadway Production===
===1999 Broadway Revival===
== Adaptations ==
In 1973, the show was adapted for television in a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV special, broadcast on NBC. Actors featured in the adaptation included original 1967 cast member Bill Hinnant as Snoopy. Hinnant was the only member of the original off-Broadway cast to reprise their role in the special.

CBS aired a new prime-time animated TV special in 1985, based on the original musical. This version was the first animated depiction of Snoopy with comprehensible dialogue, voiced by Robert Towers, who previously portrayed the role in the 1967 Los Angeles production alongside Burghoff as Charlie Brown and Judy Kaye as Lucy.

Original cast albums have been released for all three versions of the stage show, however the 1973 Hallmark Hall of Fame recording on Atlantic Records is no longer in print.

<doc id="531871" wikidata="Q1196538" url="?curid=531871" title="Descartes' theorem">
<text>In geometry, Descartes&#x27; theorem states that for every four kissing, or mutually tangent circles, the radii of the circles satisfy a certain quadratic equation. By solving this equation, one can construct a fourth circle tangent to three given, mutually tangent circles. The theorem is named after René Descartes, who stated it in 1643.

Frederick Soddy&#x27;s 1936 poem &quot;The Kiss Precise&quot; summarizes the theorem in terms of the &quot;bends&quot; (signed inverse radii) of the four circles:
Special cases of the theorem apply when one or two of the circles is replaced by a straight line (with zero bend) or when the bends are integers or square numbers. A version of the theorem using complex numbers allows the centers of the circles, and not just their radii, to be calculated. With an appropriate definition of curvature, the theorem also applies in spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In higher dimensions, an analogous quadratic equation applies to systems of pairwise tangent spheres or hyperspheres.

==History==
Geometrical problems involving tangent circles have been pondered for millennia. In ancient Greece of the third century BC, Apollonius of Perga devoted an entire book to the topic, [&quot;Tangencies&quot;]. It has been lost, and is known largely through a description of its contents by Pappus of Alexandria and through fragmentary references to it in medieval Islamic mathematics. However, Greek geometry was largely focused on straightedge and compass construction. For instance, the problem of Apollonius, closely related to Descartes&#x27; theorem, asks for the construction of a circle tangent to three given circles which need not themselves be tangent. Instead, Descartes&#x27; theorem is formulated using algebraic relations between numbers describing geometric forms. This is characteristic of analytic geometry, a field pioneered by René Descartes and Pierre de Fermat in the first half of the 17th century.

Descartes discussed the tangent circle problem briefly in 1643, in two letters to Princess Elisabeth of the Palatinate. Descartes initially posed to the princess the problem of Apollonius. After Elisabeth&#x27;s partial results revealed that solving the full problem analytically would be too tedious, he simplified the problem to the case in which the three given circles are mutually tangent, and in solving this simplified problem he came up with the equation describing the relation between the radii, or curvatures, of four pairwise tangent circles. This result became known as Descartes&#x27; theorem. Descartes did not provide the reasoning through which he found this relation.

Japanese mathematics frequently concerned problems involving circles and their tangencies, and Japanese mathematician Yamaji Nushizumi stated a form of Descartes&#x27; circle theorem in 1751. Like Descartes, he expressed it as a polynomial equation on the radii rather than their curvatures. The special case of this theorem for one straight line and three circles was recorded on a Japanese sangaku tablet from 1824.

Descartes&#x27; theorem was rediscovered in 1826 by Jakob Steiner, in 1842 by Philip Beecroft, and in 1936 by Frederick Soddy. Soddy chose to format his version of the theorem as a poem, &quot;The Kiss Precise&quot;, and published it in &quot;Nature&quot;. The kissing circles in this problem are sometimes known as Soddy circles. Soddy also extended the theorem to spheres, and in another poem described the chain of six spheres each tangent to its neighbors and to three given mutually tangent spheres, a configuration now called Soddy&#x27;s hexlet. Thorold Gosset and several others extended the theorem and the poem to arbitrary dimensions; Gosset&#x27;s version was published the following year. The generalization is sometimes called the &quot;Soddy–Gosset theorem&quot;, although both the hexlet and the three-dimensional version were known earlier, in sangaku and in the 1886 work of Robert Lachlan.

Multiple proofs of the theorem have been published. Steiner&#x27;s proof uses Pappus chains and Viviani&#x27;s theorem. Proofs by Philip Beecroft and by H. S. M. Coxeter involve four more circles, passing through triples of tangencies of the original three circles; Coxeter also provided a proof using inversive geometry. Additional proofs involve arguments based on symmetry, calculations in exterior algebra, or algebraic manipulation of Heron&#x27;s formula (for which see ). The result also follows from the observation that the Cayley–Menger determinant of the four coplanar circle centers is zero.

==Statement==

Descartes&#x27; theorem is most easily stated in terms of the circles&#x27; curvatures. The &quot;signed curvature&quot; (or &quot;bend&quot;) of a circle is defined where formula_1 is its radius. The larger a circle, the smaller is the magnitude of its curvature, and vice versa. The sign in formula_2 (represented by the formula_3 symbol) is positive for a circle that is &quot;externally&quot; tangent to the other circles. For an &quot;internally&quot; tangent circle that &quot;circumscribes&quot; the other circles, the sign is negative. If a straight line is considered a degenerate circle with zero curvature (and thus infinite radius), Descartes&#x27; theorem also applies to a line and three circles that are all three mutually tangent (see Generalized circle).

For four circles that are tangent to each other at six distinct points, with curvatures formula_4 Descartes&#x27; theorem says:

If one of the four curvatures is considered to be a variable, and the rest to be constants, this is a quadratic equation.
To find the radius of a fourth circle tangent to three given kissing circles, the quadratic equation can be solved as

The formula_3 symbol indicates that in general this equation has &quot;two&quot; solutions, and any triple of tangent circles has two tangent circles (or degenerate straight lines). Problem-specific criteria may favor one of these two solutions over the other in any given problem.

The theorem does not apply to systems of circles with more than two circles tangent to each other at the same point. It requires that the points of tangency be distinct. When more than two circles are tangent at a single point, there can be infinitely many such circles, with arbitrary curvatures; see pencil of circles.

==Locating the circle centers==
To determine a circle completely, not only its radius (or curvature), but also its center must be known. The relevant equation is expressed most clearly if the Cartesian coordinates formula_6 are interpreted as a complex number formula_7. The equation then looks similar to Descartes&#x27; theorem and is therefore called the &quot;complex Descartes theorem&quot;. Given four circles with curvatures formula_4 and centers formula_9 the following equality holds in addition to :

Once formula_10 has been found using , one may proceed to calculate formula_11 by solving as a quadratic equation, leading to a form similar to :

formula_12

Again, in general there are two solutions corresponding to the two solutions The plus/minus sign in the above formula does not necessarily correspond to the plus/minus sign in the formula 

==Special cases==
=== Three congruent circles ===
When three of the four circles are congruent, their centers form an equilateral triangle, as do their points of tangency. The two possibilities for a fourth circle tangent to all three are concentric, and reduces to

formula_13

===One or more straight lines===

If one of the three circles is replaced by a straight line tangent to the remaining circles, then its curvature is zero and drops out of For instance, then can be factorized 

formula_14

and simplifies 

formula_15

Taking the square root of both sides leads to another alternative formulation of this case 

formula_16

which has been described as &quot;a sort of demented version of the Pythagorean theorem&quot;.

If two circles are replaced by lines, the tangency between the two replaced circles becomes a parallelism between their two replacement lines. In this case, is reduced to the trivial

formula_17

This corresponds to the observation that, for all four curves to remain mutually tangent, the other two circles must be 

===Integer curvatures===

When four tangent circles described by all have integer curvatures, the alternative fourth circle described by the second solution to the equation must also have an integer curvature. This is because both solutions differ from an integer by the square root of an integer, and so either solution can only be an integer if this square root, and hence the other solution, is also an integer. Every four integers that satisfy the equation in Descartes&#x27; theorem form the curvatures of four tangent Integer quadruples of this type are also closely related to Heronian triangles, triangles with integer sides and 

Starting with any four mutually tangent circles, and repeatedly replacing one of the four with its alternative solution (Vieta jumping), in all possible ways, leads to a system of infinitely many tangent circles called an Apollonian gasket. When the initial four circles have integer curvatures, so does each replacement, and therefore all of the circles in the gasket have integer curvatures. Any four tangent circles with integer curvatures belong to exactly one such gasket, uniquely described by its &quot;root quadruple&quot; of the largest four largest circles and four smallest curvatures. This quadruple can be found, starting from any other quadruple from the same gasket, by repeatedly replacing the smallest circle by a larger one that solves the same Descartes equation, until no such reduction is possible.

A root quadruple is said to be &quot;primitive&quot; if it has no nontrivial common divisor. Every primitive root quadruple can be found from a factorization of a sum of two squares, as the To be primitive, it must satisfy the additional Factorizations of sums of two squares can be obtained using the sum of two squares theorem. Any other integer Apollonian gasket can be formed by multiplying a primitive root quadruple by an arbitrary integer, and any quadruple in one of these gaskets (that is, any integer solution to the Descartes equation) can be formed by reversing the replacement process used to find the root quadruple. For instance, the gasket with root shown in the figure, is generated in this way from the factorized sum of two squares 
===Ford circles===
The special cases of one straight line and integer curvatures combine in the Ford circles. These are an infinite family of circles tangent to the of the Cartesian coordinate system at its rational points. Each fraction formula_18 (in lowest terms) has a circle tangent to the line at the point formula_19 with curvature formula_20. Three of these curvatures, together with the zero curvature of the axis, meet the conditions of Descartes&#x27; theorem whenever the denominators of two of the corresponding fractions sum to the denominator of the third. The two Ford circles for fractions formula_18 and formula_22 (both in lowest terms) are tangent When they are tangent, they form a quadruple of tangent circles with the and with the circle for their mediant formula_23.

The Ford circles belong to a special Apollonian gasket with root bounded between two parallel lines, which may be taken as the and the This is the only Apollonian gasket containing a straight line, and not bounded within a negative-curvature circle. The Ford circles are the circles in this gasket that are tangent to the .
===Geometric progression===
When the four radii of the circles in Descartes&#x27; theorem are assumed to be in a geometric progression with the curvatures are also in the same progression (in reverse). Plugging this ratio into the theorem gives the equation

formula_24

which has only one real solution greater than one, the ratio

formula_25

where formula_26 is the golden ratio. If the same progression is continued in both directions, each consecutive four numbers describe circles obeying Descartes&#x27; theorem. The resulting double-ended geometric progression of circles can be arranged into a single spiral pattern of tangent circles, called Coxeter&#x27;s loxodromic sequence of tangent circles. It was first described, together with analogous constructions in higher dimensions, by H. S. M. Coxeter in 1968.
==Soddy circles of a triangle==

Any triangle in the plane has three externally tangent circles centered at its vertices. Letting formula_27 be the three points, formula_28 be the lengths of the opposite sides, and formula_29 be the semiperimeter, these three circles have radii By Descartes&#x27; theorem, two more circles, sometimes called &quot;Soddy circles&quot;, are tangent to these three circles. They are separated by the incircle, one interior to it and one Descartes&#x27; theorem can be used to show that the inner Soddy circle&#x27;s curvature where formula_30 is the triangle&#x27;s area, formula_31 is its circumradius, and formula_1 is its inradius. The outer Soddy circle has curvature The inner curvature is always positive, but the outer curvature can be positive, negative, or zero. Triangles whose outer circle degenerates to a straight line with curvature zero have been called &quot;Soddyian triangles&quot;.
One of the many proofs of Descartes&#x27; theorem is based on this connection to triangle geometry and on Heron&#x27;s formula for the area of a triangle as a function of its side lengths.
If three circles are externally tangent, with radii formula_33 then their centers formula_34 form the vertices of a triangle with side lengths formula_35 formula_36 and formula_37 and semiperimeter formula_38 By Heron&#x27;s formula, this triangle formula_39 has area

formula_40

Now consider the inner Soddy circle with radius formula_41 centered at point formula_42 inside the triangle. Triangle formula_39 can be broken into three smaller triangles formula_44 formula_45 and formula_46 whose areas can be obtained by substituting formula_47 for one of the other radii in the area formula above. The area of the first triangle equals the sum of these three areas:

formula_48

Careful algebraic manipulation shows that this formula is equivalent to , Descartes&#x27; theorem.

This analysis covers all cases in which four circles are externally tangent; one is always the inner Soddy circle of the other three. The cases in which one of the circles is internally tangent to the other three and forms their outer Soddy circle are similar. Again the four centers formula_49 form four triangles, but (letting formula_42 be the center of the outer Soddy circle) the triangle sides incident to formula_42 have lengths that are differences of radii, formula_52 formula_52 and formula_54 rather than sums. formula_42 may lie inside or outside the triangle formed by the other three centers; when it is inside, this triangle&#x27;s area equals the sum of the other three triangle areas, as above. When it is outside, the quadrilateral formed by the four centers can be subdivided by a diagonal into two triangles, in two different ways, giving an equality between the sum of two triangle areas and the sum of the other two triangle areas. In every case, the area equation reduces to Descartes&#x27; theorem. This method does not apply directly to the cases in which one of the circles degenerates to a line, but those can be handled as a limiting case of circles.

==Generalizations==

=== Arbitrary four-circle configurations ===

Descartes&#x27; theorem can be expressed as a matrix equation and then generalized to other configurations of four oriented circles by changing the matrix. Let formula_56 be a column vector of the four circle curvatures and let formula_57 be a symmetric matrix whose coefficients formula_58 represent the relative orientation between the th and th oriented circles at their intersection point:
formula_59

Then can be rewritten as the matrix equation

formula_60

As a generalization of Descartes&#x27; theorem, a modified symmetric matrix formula_57 can represent any desired configuration of four circles by replacing each coefficient with the &quot;inclination&quot; formula_58 between two circles, defined as

formula_63

where formula_64 are the respective radii of the circles, and formula_65 is the Euclidean distance between their centers. When the circles intersect, the cosine of the intersection angle between the circles. The inclination, sometimes called inversive distance, is formula_66 when the circles are tangent and oriented the same way at their point of tangency, formula_67 when the two circles are tangent and oriented oppositely at the point of tangency, formula_68 for orthogonal circles, outside the interval formula_69 for non-intersecting circles, and formula_70 in the limit as one circle degenerates to a 

The equation formula_71 is satisfied for any arbitrary configuration of four circles in the plane, provided formula_57 is the appropriate matrix of pairwise inclinations.

===Spherical and hyperbolic geometry===
Descartes&#x27; theorem generalizes to mutually tangent great or small circles in spherical geometry if the curvature of the formula_73th circle is defined as formula_74 the geodesic curvature of the circle relative to the sphere, which equals the cotangent of the oriented intrinsic radius formula_75 Then:

formula_76

Solving for one of the curvatures in terms of the other three,

formula_77

As a matrix equation,

formula_78

The quantity formula_79 is the &quot;stereographic diameter&quot; of a small circle. This is the Euclidean length of the diameter in the stereographically projected plane when some point on the circle is projected to the origin. For a great circle, such a stereographic projection is a straight line through the origin, so formula_80.
Likewise, the theorem generalizes to mutually tangent circles in hyperbolic geometry if the curvature of the formula_73th cycle is defined as formula_82 the geodesic curvature of the circle relative to the hyperbolic plane, the hyperbolic cotangent of the oriented intrinsic radius formula_75 Then:

formula_84

Solving for one of the curvatures in terms of the other three,

formula_85

As a matrix equation,

formula_86

This formula also holds for mutually tangent configurations in hyperbolic geometry including hypercycles and horocycles, if formula_87 is the geodesic curvature of the cycle relative to the hyperbolic plane, the reciprocal of the stereographic diameter of the cycle. This is the diameter under stereographic projection (the Poincaré disk model) when one endpoint of the diameter is projected to the origin. Hypercycles do not have a well-defined center or intrinsic radius and horocycles have an ideal point for a center and infinite intrinsic radius, but formula_88 for a hyperbolic circle, formula_89 for a horocycle, formula_90 for a hypercycle, and formula_80 for a geodesic.

===Higher dimensions===

In formula_92-dimensional Euclidean space, the maximum number of mutually tangent hyperspheres is formula_93. For example, in 3-dimensional space, five spheres can be mutually tangent. The curvatures of the hyperspheres satisfy

formula_94

with the case formula_95 corresponding to a flat hyperplane, generalizing the 2-dimensional version of the theorem. Although there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the complex numbers, the relationship between the positions of the centers can be re-expressed as a matrix equation, which also generalizes to formula_92 dimensions.

In three dimensions, suppose that three mutually tangent spheres are fixed, and a fourth sphere formula_97 is given, tangent to the three fixed spheres. The three-dimensional version of Descartes&#x27; theorem can be applied to find a sphere formula_98 tangent to formula_97 and the fixed spheres, then applied again to find a new sphere formula_100 tangent to formula_98 and the fixed spheres, and so on. The result is a cyclic sequence of six spheres each tangent to its neighbors in the sequence and to the three fixed spheres, a configuration called Soddy&#x27;s hexlet, after Soddy&#x27;s discovery and publication of it in the form of another poem in 1936.

Higher-dimensional configurations of mutually tangent hyperspheres in spherical or hyperbolic geometry, with curvatures defined as above, satisfy

formula_102

where formula_103 in spherical geometry and formula_104 in hyperbolic geometry.

<text>The Combat Action Ribbon (CAR) is a United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States Marine Corps military decoration awarded to United States sea service members &quot;who have actively participated in ground or surface combat.&quot; Coast guardsmen, Navy sailors, and Marines active in clandestine, stealth or special operations are deemed eligible for consideration of the award. The ribbon is awarded to members of the Navy and Marine Corps with a rank no higher than captain and colonel, respectively.

The U.S. Navy first authorized the Combat Action Ribbon on 17 February 1969. The Navy ribbon was originally retroactive to March 1961; in 1999 it was made retroactive to 7 December 1941.

The Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon was authorized on 16 July 2008, and may be awarded to members of the Coast Guard in the rank of captain and below, &quot;who have actively participated in ground or maritime combat.&quot; The Coast Guard ribbon is retroactive to 1 May 1975 (during the Vietnam war Coast Guard members were awarded the Navy Combat Action ribbon). Coast guardsmen in Vietnam riverine warfare operations were deemed eligible for award of the Navy Combat Action Ribbon.

Air combat does not meet the criteria for the Combat Action Ribbon; naval aviators, naval flight officers and enlisted naval air crewmen, while in the performance of aerial flight, are instead eligible for consideration for the Air Medal.

==Eligibility criteria==
For a military member to be awarded a Combat Action Ribbon evidence must establish the member engaged the enemy, was under hostile fire, or was physically attacked by the enemy. The service member must have demonstrated satisfactory performance under enemy fire while actively participating in a ground or surface engagement. The Combat Action Ribbon will not be awarded to personnel for aerial combat, since the Strike/flight Air Medal provides recognition for aerial combat exposure; however, a pilot, flight officer/navigator, or other crew member forced to escape or evade, after being forced down, may be eligible for the award. Direct exposure to the detonation of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) used by an enemy, with or without the immediate presence of enemy forces, constitutes active participation in a ground or surface engagement. Eligibility under this criterion is retroactive to 7 October 2001.

The Combat Action Ribbon is awarded to individuals only. The CAR is not awarded to a military unit, station, or group, although multiple individual service members (e.g., those stationed on a boat or warship) may be nominated for the award arising from combat action in which all participated.

A military member does not automatically qualify for the Combat Action Ribbon. The CAR is awarded after the service member&#x27;s command takes into consideration the evidence and specified criteria. The evidence must show a service member was engaged in direct combat, not indirect or in an area where combat is occurring; mere presence in a designated combat zone does not qualify a service member for the award.

Only one Combat Action Ribbon is awarded to a service member per theater of war. The CAR is a positive assessment of a service member&#x27;s battle effectiveness during a combat engagement within a specific theater of war and is not awarded for additional combat interactions therein.

A military member who serves in special operations, who by the nature of their mission, are restricted in their ability to return fire, and who are operating in conditions where the risk of enemy fire was great and expected to be encountered, may be eligible for the Combat Action Ribbon.

The Combat Action Ribbon is a ribbon-only decoration in contrast to military branches that award a badge or medal. Compare: the U.S. Army awards the Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Action Badge, or Combat Medical Badge. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force combat participant is awarded the Air Force Combat Action Medal (AFCAM), which includes both full and miniature size suspension medals and a ribbon.
The Combat Action Ribbon is worn in order of precedence on a member&#x27;s &quot;ribbon rack&quot; displayed on the left (or right) side of a service member&#x27;s uniform. The outermost blue stripe is always to the wearer&#x27;s center, with the central colors in order of red, white, and blue (left to right when worn on left side of uniform; right to left when worn on right side of uniform); only one Combat Action Ribbon is authorized for wear, with each additional CAR award signified with a inch gold or silver star device attached to the center of the ribbon. For example, two CAR awards are signified with the CAR and the addition of one gold star device. Three awards are signified with the ribbon and two gold star devices.

In full dress uniform medals are worn on the member&#x27;s left side. The CAR is therefore worn on the right side of the uniform. The CAR is the highest rated ribbon-only award in the U.S. military decorations order of precedence and is superseded only by medals of meritorious achievement and combat valor.

An individual whose eligibility has been established in combat in any of the following listed operations may be authorized award of the Combat Action Ribbon. Only one award per operation is authorized. This listing is not all-inclusive, as the Combat Action Ribbon has been awarded in minor operations, as well as for specific actions. 
==Combat Action Ribbon versions==

The Combat Action Ribbon is currently authorized with a U.S. Navy/Marine Corps design, and as of 2008, a U.S. Coast Guard version.

The Navy CAR covers the Navy and Marine Corps since the establishment of the CAR in 1969. Additionally, the award was made retroactive to 7 December 1941.

Prior to 2008, eligible U.S. Coast Guardsmen were awarded the Navy Combat Action Ribbon (because in most conflicts and wars Coast Guard members usually operated with or under the U.S. Navy). From 2009 forward, Coast Guard members who engage in combat are now awarded the Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon.

==Award inquiries==

Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard veterans are advised to submit requests about eligibility or other matters to their respective branches to inquire about the Combat Action Ribbon or other awards of this nature.

==Navy CAR==
The Navy&#x27;s Combat Action Ribbon (&quot;CAR&quot;) was established during the Vietnam War by a Secretary of the Navy Notice, dated February 17, 1969, with retroactive award to 1 March 1961. The Navy CAR is awarded to members of the Navy and Marine Corps (and Coast Guard, when operating under the control of the Navy during a war or national emergency), with the grade of captain/colonel and below, who have actively participated in ground or surface combat.

Marines, Navy sailors, or Coast Guardsmen who are awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge, Combat Medical Badge, Combat Action Badge, or Combat Action Medal while assigned to United States Army, United States Air Force, and United States Space Force units, or who earned such for prior service in the U.S. Army, Air Force, or Space Force, may be authorized to wear the Combat Action Ribbon upon application to the Department of the Navy (or Department of Homeland Security, as applicable).

After the destroyer was attacked by suicide bombers in 2000, the entire crew of the ship was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon a year later.

In January 2013, the awarding criteria were expanded to include dangerous exposure to IEDs, mines, and scatterable munitions, be it the detonation of such or direct action taken to disable, render safe, or destroy such; servicemembers may be deemed eligible if the IEDs are detonated or specifically emplaced by the enemy. Previous eligibility applied only to exposure to IEDs actually detonated by the enemy. Eligibility under this criterion is retroactive only to 7 October 2001.

Blanket lists of units and operations whose members or participants are deemed to be &quot;in-combat&quot;, and thus potentially eligible, can be found in OPNAVNOTE 1650 (for specific units and ships) and in chapter 2, appendix E, of recent SECNAVINSTs (for specific operations and ships) though, &quot;Neither service in a combat area nor being awarded the Purple Heart Medal automatically makes a service member eligible&quot;, and specific sailors and marines may receive the ribbon in recognition of individual actions or various minor operations.

In 2017, sailors from , , , and were awarded the Combat Action Ribbon after their ships were fired upon by rebels off the coast of Yemen in 2016, one of the few instances in the 21st century when U.S. Navy sailors aboard a commissioned warship were awarded the ribbon for combat occurring at sea. In 2005, the crew of the were awarded the CAR as well.

In 2024, sailors from the destroyers , , , , , , Cruiser , Carrier , amphibious assault ship , and dock landing ship were awarded the Combat Action Ribbon after their ships were fired upon by Houthi rebels during the 2024 missile strikes in Yemen and shooting down drones in the Red Sea for the time period of October 2023 to April 2024.

==World War II and Korean War==

In October 1999, World War II and Korean War veterans became retroactively eligible for the Navy Combat Action Ribbon by Public Law 106-65 on 5 October 1999, which permitted the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) to award the Combat Action Ribbon to a member of the Navy or Marine Corps for participation in ground or surface combat during any period on or after 7 December 1941, and before 1 March 1961, if the Secretary determines that the member has not been previously recognized in an appropriate manner for such participation. Two specific blocks of time were later designated by then SECNAV Danzig: Dec. 7, 1941 – Apr. 14, 1946 (World War II), and June 25, 1950 – July 27, 1954 (Korean War)

==Coast Guard CAR==
In 2009, the U.S. Coast Guard began awarding a Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon (CGCAR), that is stylized similarly in design to the Navy Combat Action Ribbon.

Prior to 2008 Coast Guard members awarded the Combat Action Ribbon received the U.S. Navy CAR because in times of conflict and war the Coast Guard in combat areas typically operated with or under the U.S. Navy. For example, in the Vietnam War&#x27;s Operation Market Time the U.S. Coast Guard had at any one time approximately 1,200 Coast Guard members participating in brown water navy riverine warfare operations. Those Coast Guard members were awarded the U.S. Navy Combat Action Ribbon by the Commander U.S. Naval Forces Vietnam.

The U.S. Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon (CGCAR) was established by the approval of the Secretary of Homeland Security on 16 July 2008, in ALCOAST 361/08. The CGCAR is awarded to members who have actively participated in ground or maritime combat. Satisfactory performance under fire with the enemy is required.

From 2009 forward U.S. Coast Guard members will receive the CGCAR regardless if a member is operating in conjunction with or under the control of the U.S. Navy. Those USCG members awarded the U.S. Navy CAR prior to 2009 are authorized to continue wearing the Navy award, or at the member&#x27;s option can choose to wear the CGCAR.

Eligibility for the CGCAR also includes personnel having direct exposure to the detonation of an enemy&#x27;s improvised explosive device, and to personnel who served in clandestine/special operations and were restricted in their ability to return fire, where the risk of enemy fire was great.

The Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon is authorized for:

*Operation Allied Force (Kosovo)
*Operation Desert Storm
*Operation Enduring Freedom
*Operation Iraqi Freedom

Other minor operations and specific actions may allow the award, as determined by the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Only one award per operation is authorized.

Initially, all other similar military awards from other services were required to be converted to the Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon in order to be worn on the Coast Guard uniform, but the policy was modified effective January 1, 2009 to allow wearing the Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Air Force Combat Action Medal, and Army Combat Infantry/Medical/Action Badge for service prior to May 1, 1975, and which cannot be converted to the Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon.

Additional awards of the Coast Guard Combat Action Ribbon are denoted by inch gold stars on the ribbon.

Notable Recipients: DC3 Nathan Bruckenthal, CWO Joseph Ruggiero, CAPT Holly Harrison, LT Michael Brooks, IS1 Daniel Duffin

<doc id="531881" wikidata="Q1426827" url="?curid=531881" title="Flexatone">
<text>The flexatone or fleximetal is a modern percussion instrument (an indirectly struck idiophone) consisting of a small flexible metal sheet suspended in a wire frame ending in a handle. Used in classic cartoons for its glissando effect, its sound is comparable to the musical saw.

==History, construction and technique==
An invention for a flexatone occurs in the British Patent Records of 1922 and 1923. In 1924 the &#x27;Flex-a-tone&#x27; was patented in the USA by the Playatone Company of New York. &quot;An instrument called the &#x27;Flex-a-tone&#x27; was patented in the U.S.A. in 1924 by the Playertone Company of New York. It was introduced as a new instrument, making &#x27;jazz jazzier&#x27; and announced as combining the tone effect of musical saw, orchestra bells, and song whistle.&quot; &quot;Small sheet of spring steel in a frame with wooden strikers mounted on either side. The player shakes the beater while bending the steel in order to change the pitch.&quot;

The instrument was first used in 1920s jazz bands as an effect but is now mainly and rarely used in orchestral music.

Wooden knobs mounted on strips of spring steel lie on each side of the metal sheet. The player holds the flexatone in one hand with the palm around the wire frame and the thumb on the free end of the spring steel. The player then shakes the instrument with a trembling movement which causes the beaters to strike the sides of the metal sheet. While shaking the handle, the musician makes a high- or low-pitched sound depending on the curve given to the blade by the pressure from his or her thumb: &quot;As the thumb depresses the vibrating metal sheet, the relative pitch of the instrument ascends; as the thumb pressure is released, the relative pitch of the instrument descends.&quot; A vibrato is thus produced. While the instrument has a very limited dynamic range, volume can be controlled by how vigorously or delicately the player shakes the Flexatone.

&quot;Vibes generally make a perfectly acceptable alternative, especially when the music is somewhat indeterminate anyway.&quot;

An alternate technique involves removing the two wooden knobs and their mounting springs, and then using a small metal rod (e.g., a triangle beater) held in the free hand striking the strip of spring steel. The pitch is altered in the same manner as the previous technique. &quot;This method give the player greater control of the sound of the flexatone as it eliminates the need to shake the instrument.&quot; This method of playing results in a different, more constrained sound. The flexatone may also be bowed along its edge with an orchestral string instrument bow.

The flexatone is notated using tremolo lines (rolls) to indicate shaking the instrument and lines to indicate the desired direction of the glissando or a wavy line (chevron) to indicate alternating thumb pressure. If using the instrument with the balls removed, indicate strikes with single notes followed by arrows indicating the direction of the glissando (similar to a guitar tab pitch bend). It is recommended that pitch designation should only be approximate, as, &quot;specific pitches are difficult but possible; glissandi without specific pitch are easily executed.&quot;

==Double meaning of the term &quot;Flexatone&quot;==
In contemporary music of the 20th century between around 1920 and 1970 the term &quot;Flexatone&quot; has been used on one hand for the instrument flexatone, on the other hand for the musical saw. Composers who used it for the musical saw were: Arthur Honegger (Short opera &quot;Antigone&quot;, 1924/1927), Ernst Krenek (opera &quot;Jonny spielt auf&quot;, 1927), Dmitri Shostakovich (&quot;The Nose&quot; (1929), &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; (1934), and film music for &quot;The New Babylon&quot; (1929)), Aram Khachaturian (Piano Concerto 1936), and Hans Werner Henze (opera &quot;Elegy for young lovers&quot;, 1961).

==Uses==
The flexatone is sometimes heard in funk music, and occasionally in pop music for special effect. It is occasionally used in the soundtracks of films or cartoons to represent &quot;ghosts&quot; or other paranormal phenomena. The instrument is also typical and common in G-Funk music.

The instrument is not often used in classical music, but it appears in the work of Arnold Schoenberg, Hans Werner Henze, Sofia Gubaidulina, György Ligeti and others. Schoenberg employed it, &quot;unrealistically...accurate bursts of widely spaced sounds being hardly obtainable with such abruptness,&quot; in his &quot;Variations for Orchestra Op.31&quot; (1928) and his unfinished opera &quot;Moses und Aron&quot; (1932). The cellist in Sofia Gubaidulina&#x27;s &quot;The Canticle of the Sun&quot; (1998) plays a bowed flexatone before the final section. Alfred Schnittke used it in his &quot;Faust Cantata&quot; (1983), in the &quot;Tuba Mirum&quot; movement of his &quot;Requiem&quot; (1975), in his Viola Concerto (1985), and in his score for the ballet &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; (1987), the flexatone represents the sound of the moaning wind. György Ligeti used it in many of his works, such as his 1988 concerto for piano second movement and his opera &quot;Le Grand Macabre&quot; (1977). Peter Maxwell Davies uses it in the third movement of his Symphony No. 1 (1976), as well as three of them at the climax of his opera &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; (1980). Vivian Fine owned a flexatone, and used flexatone music in compositions such as &quot;The Race of Life&quot; (1937). 

The most well-known use of the instrument is in the theme song of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (2004).

<doc id="531883" wikidata="Q18288814" url="?curid=531883" title="ATHENA experiment">
<text>ATHENA, also known as the AD-1 experiment, was an antimatter research project at the Antiproton Decelerator at CERN, Geneva. In August 2002, it was the first experiment to produce 50,000 low-energy antihydrogen atoms, as reported in &quot;Nature&quot;. In 2005, ATHENA was disbanded and many of the former members of the research team worked on the subsequent ALPHA experiment and AEgIS experiment.

== Experimental setup ==

The ATHENA apparatus comprised four main subsystems: the antiproton catching trap, the positron accumulator, the antiproton/positron mixing trap, and the antihydrogen annihilation detector. All traps in the experiment were variations of the Penning trap, which uses an axial magnetic field to transversely confine the charged particles, and a series of hollow cylindrical electrodes to trap them axially. The catching and mixing traps were adjacent to each other, and coaxial with a 3 T magnetic field from a superconducting solenoid.

The positron accumulator had its own magnetic system, also a solenoid, with a field strength of 0.14 Tesla. A separate cryogenic heat exchanger in the bore of the superconducting magnet cooled the catching and mixing traps to about 15 K. The ATHENA apparatus featured an open, modular design that allowed experimental flexibility, particularly in introducing large numbers of positrons into the apparatus.

=== Catching trap ===
The catching trap slowed, trapped, cooled, and accumulated antiprotons. To cool antiprotons, the catching trap was first loaded with electrons, which cooled by synchrotron radiation in the 3 Tesla magnetic field. Typically, the AD delivered antiprotons having kinetic energy 5.3 MeV and a pulse duration of 200 ns to the experiment at 100 s intervals. The antiprotons were slowed in a thin foil and trapped using a pulsed electric field. The antiprotons lost energy and equilibrated with the cold electrons by Coulomb interaction. The electrons were ejected before mixing the antiprotons with positrons. Each AD shot resulted in about cold antiprotons for interaction experiments.

=== Positron accumulator ===
The positron accumulator slowed, trapped and accumulated positrons emitted from a radioactive source (1. Bq 22Na). Accumulation for 300 s yields 1. positrons, 50% of which were transferred to the mixing trap, where they cooled by synchrotron radiation.

=== Mixing trap ===
The mixing trap had the axial potential configuration of a nested Penning trap, which permitted two plasmas of opposite charge to come into contact. In ATHENA, the spheroidal positron cloud could be characterized by exciting and detecting axial plasma oscillations. Typical conditions were: stored positrons, a radius of 2 – 2.5 mm, a length of 32 mm, and a maximum density of 2.. An antihydrogen annihilation detector was situated coaxially with the mixing region, between the trap outer radius and the magnet bore.

=== Antihydrogen annihilation detector ===
The detector was designed to provide unambiguous evidence for antihydrogen production by detecting the temporally and spatially coincident annihilations of the antiproton and positron when a neutral antihydrogen atom escaped the electromagnetic trap and struck the trap electrodes. An antiproton typically annihilates into a few charged or neutral pions. The charged pions were detected by two layers of double-sided, position sensitive, silicon microstrips. The path of a charged particle passing through both layers could be reconstructed, and two or more intersecting tracks allowed determination of the position, or vertex, of the antiproton annihilation. The uncertainty in vertex determination was approximately 4 mm and is dominated by the unmeasured curvature of the charged pions&#x27; trajectories in the magnetic field. The temporal coincidence window was approximately 5 microseconds. The solid angle coverage of the interaction region was about 80% of 4π.

A positron annihilating with an electron yields two or three photons. The positron detector, comprising 16 rows each containing 12 scintillating, pure cesium-iodide-crystals, was designed to detect the two-photon events, consisting of two 511 keV photons which are always emitted back-to-back. The energy resolution of the detector was 18% full width half maximum at 511 keV, and the photo-peak detection efficiency for single photons was about 20%. The maximum readout rate of the whole detector was about 40 Hz. Ancillary detectors included large scintillator paddles external to the magnet, and a thin, position sensitive, silicon diode through which the incident antiproton beam passed before entering the catching trap.

To produce antihydrogen atoms, a positron well in the mixing region was filled with about positrons and allowed to cool to the ambient temperature (15 kelvin). The nested trap was then formed around the positron well. Next, approximately 104 antiprotons were launched into the mixing region by pulsing the trap from one potential configuration to another. The mixing time is 190 s, after which all particles were dumped and the process repeated. Events triggering the imaging silicon detector (three sides hit in the outer layer) initiated readout of both the silicon and the CsI modules.

Using this method, ATHENA could produce – for the first time – several thousands of cold antihydrogen atoms in 2002.

<text>A dos Francos is one of twelve civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;) in the municipality of Caldas da Rainha, Portugal. The population in 2011 was 1,701, in an area of 18.93 km2. It includes the settlements A dos Francos, Broeiras, Carreiros, Casais da Aramanha, Casais da Bica, Casais da Paraventa, Casais de Santa Helena, Casais Gaiolas, Casal da Palmeira, Casal das Cheiras, Casal das Sesmarias, Casal Sobreiro, Casal Pinheiro, Casal Val Covo, Salgueirinha, Santa Susana and Vila Verde de Matos.

==History==
The history and toponymy of this parish can be traced back to the French; the name, itself, evokes French ownership or dominion of this area. &quot;A dos French&quot; literally means &quot;of the French&quot;. In fact, it was Afonso Henriques, who had a hand in its nomenclature; in order to reward mercenary French crusaders who assisted his early campaigns, Afonso Henriques distributed some lands along the margins of the Tagus, living behind names that only hint at French influence, including Vila Franca and A dos Francos.

The &quot;Chapel of the Holy Spirit&quot; was constructed by the Crusaders during the 12th century, who fell within the territorial influence of Óbidos.

These foreign colonies including those in the Estremadura were favored by King Sancho, who also received complementary immigrants from Flanders, who populated the northern parts of the Tagus.

In 1747, the population of this village included twelve homes. By 1853, the parish had amassed a small cluster of 101 homes.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Carriage Post/Station of Casal dos Carreiros (), constructed in the 19th century, accompanying the building of the Lisbon-Porto carriage traffic, this building served as a hostel for travellers, serving meals and providing sleeping spaces and fireplace for use in the winter months

===Religious===
* Chapel of the Holy Spirit (), an eclectic chapel, that was originally constructed by French crusader knights, who inhabited and populated the region;
* Church of São Silvestre (), the 18th century church was constructed in the Baroque style, and includes elaborate gilded wood alterpeice and retable, and singular belfrey, typical of the Portuguese small parish churches of the time;
* Hermitage of Vila Verde do Mato (), the partially ruined hermitage, constructed in the 17th century, is remarkable for the remnants of decorative polychromatic ocre alterpeice, and construction in the Mannerist architecture of the period.

<text>Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Yevtushenko (; 18 July 1933 – 1 April 2017) was a Soviet-Russian poet, novelist, essayist, dramatist, screenwriter, publisher, actor, editor, university professor, and director of several films.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Yevtushenko was born Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Gangnus (he later took his mother&#x27;s last name, Yevtushenko) in the Irkutsk region of Siberia in a small town called Zima on 18 July 1933 to a peasant family of noble descent. He had Russian, Baltic German, Ukrainian, Polish, Belarusian, and Tatar roots. His maternal great-grandfather Joseph Baikovsky belonged to szlachta, while his wife was of Ukrainian descent. They were exiled to Siberia after a peasant rebellion headed by Joseph. One of their daughters – Maria Baikovskaya – married Ermolai Naumovich Yevtushenko who was of Belarusian descent. He served as a soldier in the Imperial Army during World War I and as an officer in the Red Army during the Civil War. His paternal ancestors were Germans who moved to the Russian Empire in 1767. His grandfather Rudolph Gangnus, a math teacher of Baltic German descent, married Anna Plotnikova of Russian nobility. Both of Yevtushenko&#x27;s grandfathers were arrested during Stalin&#x27;s purges as &quot;enemies of the people&quot; in 1937.

Yevtushenko&#x27;s father, Aleksandr Rudolfovich Gangnus, was a geologist, as was his mother, Zinaida Ermolaevna Yevtushenko, who later became a singer. The boy accompanied his father on geological expeditions to Kazakhstan in 1948, and to Altai, Siberia, in 1950. Young Yevtushenko wrote his first verses and humorous chastushki while living in Zima, Siberia. His parents were divorced when he was 7 and he was raised by his mother. By age 10, he had composed his first poem. Six years later a sports journal was the first periodical to publish his poetry. At 19, he published his first book of poems, &quot;The Prospects of the Future&quot;.

After the Second World War, Yevtushenko moved to Moscow and from 1951 to 1954 studied at the Gorky Institute of Literature in Moscow, from which he dropped out. In 1952, he joined the Union of Soviet Writers after publication of his first collection of poetry. His early poem &quot;So mnoyu vot chto proiskhodit&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s what is happening to me&quot;) became a very popular song, performed by actor-songwriter Alexander Dolsky. In 1955, Yevtushenko wrote a poem about the Soviet borders being an obstacle in his life. His first important publication was the 1956 poem &quot;Stantsiya Zima&quot; (&quot;Zima Station&quot;). In 1957, he was expelled from the Literary Institute for &quot;individualism&quot;. He was once labeled &quot;&quot;the head of the intellectual juvenile delinquents&quot; whose poems were &quot;pygmy spittle&quot;&quot;. He was banned from travelling but gained wide popularity with the Soviet public. His early work also drew praise from Boris Pasternak, Carl Sandburg and Robert Frost.

===During the Khrushchev Thaw===
Yevtushenko was one of the authors politically active during the Khrushchev Thaw. In 1961, he wrote what would become perhaps his most famous poem, &quot;Babiyy Yar&quot;, in which he denounced the Soviet distortion of historical fact regarding the Nazi massacre of the Jewish population of Kyiv in September 1941, as well as the anti-Semitism still widespread in the Soviet Union. The usual Soviet policy in relation to the Holocaust in Russia was to describe it as general atrocities against Soviet citizens and to avoid mentioning that it was a genocide of the Jews. However, Yevtushenko&#x27;s work &quot;Babiyy Yar&quot; &quot;spoke not only of the Nazi atrocities, but the Soviet government&#x27;s own persecution of Jewish people.&quot; The poem was published in a major newspaper, &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot;, achieved widespread circulation in numerous copies, and later was set to music, together with four other Yevtushenko poems, by Dmitri Shostakovich in his Thirteenth Symphony, subtitled &quot;Babi Yar&quot;. Of Yevtushenko&#x27;s work, Shostakovich has said, &quot;Morality is a sister of conscience. And perhaps God is with Yevtushenko when he speaks of conscience. Every morning, in place of prayers, I reread or repeat by memory two poems by Yevtushenko: &#x27;Career&#x27; or &#x27;Boots&#x27;.&quot;

After the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in October 1961 – at which the former dictator Joseph Stalin was denounced in public for crimes committed in the 1930s, Yevtushenko was allowed to join the editorial board of the journal &quot;Yunost&quot;, and in October 1962 was sent to Cuba as a correspondent of &quot;Pravda&quot;. In 1962, knowing that there was backlash against the anti-Stalin campaign, Yevtushenko wrote &quot;Nasledniki Stalina&quot; (&quot;The Heirs of Stalin&quot;), in which he stated that although Stalin was dead, Stalinism and its legacy still dominated the country; in the poem he also directly addressed the Soviet government, imploring them to make sure that Stalin would &quot;never rise again&quot;. The poem also taunted neo-Stalinists for being out of touch with the times, saying &quot;No wonder they suffer heart attacks.&quot; It was well known that Khrushchev&#x27;s most dangerous rival, Frol Kozlov had recently had a heart attack. Yevtushenko wrote in his memoirs that he sent a copy of the poem to Khrushchev, who approved its publication. Published originally in &quot;Pravda&quot; on 21 October 1962, the poem was not republished until a quarter of a century later, in the times of the comparatively liberal Party leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

In January 1963, he began a tour of West Germany and France, and while he was in Paris, arranged for his &quot;Precocious Autobiography&quot; to be serialised in &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;. This created a scandal in Moscow. In February, he was ordered to return to the USSR and at the end of March he was accused by the writer G. A. Zhukov of an &#x27;act of treason&#x27; and in April another writer, Vladimir Fedorov, proposed that he be expelled from the Writers&#x27; Union. No official action was taken against him, but he was barred from travelling abroad for several years.
Yevtushenko became one of the best known poets of the 1950s and 1960s in the Soviet Union. He was part of the 1960s generation, which included such writers as Vasily Aksyonov, Andrei Voznesensky, Bella Akhmadulina, Robert Rozhdestvensky, Anatoly Gladilin; as well as actors Andrei Mironov, Aleksandr Zbruyev, Natalya Fateyeva, and many others. During the time, Anna Akhmatova, a number of whose family members suffered under the communist rule, criticised Yevtushenko&#x27;s aesthetic ideals and his poetics. The poet Victor Krivulin quoted her, saying that &quot;Yevtushenko doesn&#x27;t rise above an average newspaper satirist&#x27;s level. Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky&#x27;s works just don&#x27;t do it for me, therefore neither of them exists for me as a poet.&quot;

Alternatively, Yevtushenko was much respected by others at the time both for his poetry and his political stance toward the Soviet government. &quot;Dissident Pavel Litvinov had said that &#x27;[Yevtushenko] expressed what my generation felt. Then we left him behind.&#x27;&quot; Between 1963 until 1965, for example, Yevtushenko, already an internationally recognised &quot;littérateur&quot;, was banned from travelling outside the Soviet Union. In 1963, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature for his poem &quot;Babiyy Yar&quot;.

Generally, however, Yevtushenko was still the most extensively travelled Soviet poet, possessing an amazing capability to balance between moderate criticism of the Soviet regime, which gained him popularity in the West, and, as noted by some, a strong Marxist–Leninist ideological stance, which allegedly proved his loyalty to Soviet authorities.

At that time, KGB Chairman Vladimir Semichastny and the next KGB Chairman Yuri Andropov reported to the Communist Politburo on the &quot;Anti-Soviet activity of poet Yevtushenko.&quot; Nevertheless, some nicknamed Yevtushenko &quot;Zhenya Gapon,&quot; comparing him to Father Georgy Gapon, a Russian priest who at the time of the Revolution of 1905 was both a leader of rebellious workers and a secret police agent.

===Controversy===

In 1965, Yevtushenko joined Anna Akhmatova, Korney Chukovsky, Jean-Paul Sartre and others and co-signed the letter of protest against the unfair trial of Joseph Brodsky as a result of the court case against him initiated by the Soviet authorities. He subsequently co-signed a letter against the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.

Nevertheless, &quot;when, in 1987, Yevtushenko was made an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Brodsky himself led a flurry of protest, accusing Yevtushenko of duplicity and claiming that Yevtushenko&#x27;s criticism of the Soviet Union was launched only in the directions approved by the Party and that he criticised what was acceptable to the Kremlin, when it was acceptable to the Kremlin, while soaking up adulation and honours as a fearless voice of dissent.&quot; Further, of note is &quot;Yevtushenko&#x27;s protest of the trial of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel, an event now credited with inaugurating the modern dissident movement and readying the national pulse for perestroika. Both writers had toiled under pseudonyms and stood accused, in 1966, of &quot;anti-Soviet activity&quot; for the views espoused by their fictional characters. But Yevtushenko&#x27;s actual position was that the writers were guilty, only punished too severely.&quot; &quot;Yevtushenko was not among the authors of the &quot;Letter of the 63&quot; who protested [their convictions].&quot;

On 23 August 1968, Yevtushenko sent a telegram to the Soviet prime minister Alexei Kosygin lamenting the invasion of Czechoslovakia, but &quot;when Yevtushenko was nominated for the poetry chair at Oxford in 1968, Kingsley Amis, Bernard Levin, and the Russian-Hungarian historian Tibor Szamuely led the campaign against him, arguing that he had made life difficult for his fellow Soviet writers.&quot;

===Films===
He was filmed as himself during the 1950s as a performing poet-actor. Yevtushenko contributed lyrics to several Soviet films and contributed to the script of &quot;Soy Cuba&quot; (&quot;I Am Cuba&quot;, 1964), a Soviet propaganda film. His acting career began with the leading role in &quot;Vzlyot&quot; (&quot;Take-Off&quot;, 1979) by director Savva Kulish, where he played the leading role as Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Yevtushenko also made two films as a writer/director. His film &quot;Detsky Sad&quot; (&quot;Kindergarten&quot;, 1983) and his last film, &quot;Pokhorony Stalina&quot; (&quot;Stalin&#x27;s Funeral&quot;, 1990) deal with life in the Soviet Union.

===Post-Soviet period===
In 1989, Yevtushenko was elected as a representative for Kharkiv in the Soviet Parliament (Congress of Peoples Deputies), where he was a member of the pro-democratic group supporting Mikhail Gorbachev. In 1991, he supported Boris Yeltsin, as the latter defended the parliament of the Russian Federation during the hardline coup that sought to oust Gorbachev and reverse &quot;perestroika&quot;. Later, however, when Yeltsin sent tanks into restive Chechnya, Yevtushenko reportedly &quot;denounced his old ally and refused to accept an award from him.&quot;

In the post-Soviet era, Yevtushenko actively discussed environmental issues, confronted Russian Nationalist writers from the alternative Union of the Writers of Russia, and campaigned for the preservation of the memory of victims of Stalin&#x27;s Gulag. In 1995, he published his huge anthology of contemporary Russian poetry entitled &quot;Verses of the Century&quot;.

===In the West===
After October 2007, Yevtushenko divided his time between Russia and the United States, teaching Russian and European poetry and the history of world cinema at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma and at Queens College of the City University of New York as well as at Florida Atlantic University. In a 1995 interview, he said, &quot;I like very much the University of Tulsa. My students are sons of ranchers, even cowboys, oil engineers. They are different people, but they are very gifted. They are closer to Mother Nature than the big city. They are more sensitive.&quot;

In the West, he was best known for his criticism of the Soviet bureaucracy and appeals for getting rid of the legacy of Stalin. He was working on a three-volume collection of 11th to 20th-century Russian poetry and planned a novel based on his time in Havana during the Cuban Missile Crisis (he was, reportedly, good friends with Che Guevara, Salvador Allende and Pablo Neruda).

In October 2007, he was an artist-in-residence with the College of Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland, College Park, and recited his poem &quot;Babi Yar&quot; before a performance of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 13 by the University of Maryland Symphony Orchestra. The first time that the two works that Shostakovich set to Yevtushenko texts were performed on the same program, was in 1998 at the University of Houston&#x27;s Moores School of Music, under the baton of Franz Anton Krager, with Yevtushenko present. The performance was the idea of the then-President of the Moores School of Music Society, Philip Berquist, a long-time friend of Yevtushenko, after the poet informed him that the two works had never been performed together. Yevtushenko had told Berquist that Leonard Bernstein had wanted to do so, but it never came to realisation.

The first translation of Yevtushenko&#x27;s poetry into English was &quot;Yevtushenko: Selected Poems&quot;, a translation by Robin Milner-Gulland and Peter Levi published in 1962.

==Criticism==
Michael Weiss, writing in &quot;The New York Sun&quot; in 2008, asserted that &quot;Yevtushenko&#x27;s politics have always been a complicated mixture of bravery, populism, and vulgar accommodation with dictatorship.&quot; Judith Colp of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, for example, described Yevtushenko as &quot;his country&#x27;s most controversial modern poet, a man whose reputation is poised between courageous behind-the-scenes reformer and failed dissident.&quot; Indeed, &quot;as the Sovietologist and literary critic Robert Conquest put it in a 1974 profile: &#x27;The writers who had briefly flourished [under Khrushchev&#x27;s thaw] went two different ways. Solzhenitsyn and his like into silenced opposition; Yevtushenko and his like, sometimes reluctantly, sometimes in the hope of still influencing matters a little, into well-rewarded collaboration.&#x27;&quot; Some argue that before the appearance of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov, and the dissident movement in the Soviet Union, Yevtushenko, through his poetry, was the first voice to speak out against Stalinism (although Boris Pasternak is often considered &quot;to have helped give birth to the dissident movement with the publication of his &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;&quot;). Colp adds: &quot;Sovietologist Stephen Cohen of Princeton University contends that Yevtushenko was among those Soviets who didn&#x27;t become dissidents but in their own way tried to improve conditions and prepare the way for reform, [saying that] &#x27;They exhibited a kind of civic courage that many Americans didn&#x27;t recognize.&#x27;&quot; Kevin O&#x27;Connor, in his &quot;Intellectuals and Apparatchiks,&quot; noted that Yevtushenko was &quot;a popular liberal who never experienced the sort of intimidation that characterized regime&#x27;s treatment of dissident writers Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Vladimir Voinovich (each of whom was forced to leave the USSR).&quot;

The exile poet Joseph Brodsky repeatedly criticised Yevtushenko for what he perceived as his &quot;conformism&quot;, especially after the latter was made a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Commenting on this controversy in &quot;A Night in the Nabokov Hotel&quot;, an anthology of Russian poetry in English translation, Anatoly Kudryavitsky wrote that &quot;A few Russian poets enjoyed virtual pop-star status, unthinkable if transposed to other parts of Europe. In reality, they were far from any sort of protest against Soviet totalitarianism and therefore could not be regarded as anything else but naughty children of the regime.&quot; Furthermore, some criticised Yevtushenko regarding Pasternak&#x27;s widow, given that &quot;when Pasternak&#x27;s widow, Olga Ivinskaya, was imprisoned on trumped-up charges of illegally dealing in foreign currency, Yevtushenko publicly maligned her [and added] that &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; was not worth publishing in the Soviet Union.&quot; Brodsky once said of Yevtushenko, &quot;He throws stones only in directions that are officially sanctioned and approved.&quot;

Moreover, &quot;the poet Irina Ratushinskaya, upon her release from prison and arrival in the West, dismissed Yevtushenko as &quot;an official poet&quot; and the novelist Vasily Aksyonov has also refused contact [with Yevtushenko].&quot; Responding to the criticism, Yevtushenko reportedly said:

Who could sanction me to write &quot;Babi Yar&quot;, or my protests against the (1968) Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia? Only I criticised Khrushchev to his face; not even Solzhenitsyn did that. It is only the envy of people who couldn&#x27;t stand against the propaganda machine, and they invented things about my generation, the artists of the &#x27;60s. Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our dreams were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.

Yevtushenko further notes that &quot;in several cases [he] personally rose to the defense of these writers, interceding privately for Ratushinskaya&#x27;s release from prison, defending Aksyonov and others who were expelled from the Writers&#x27; Union.&quot;

Critics differ on the stature of Yevtushenko in the literature world, with &quot;most Western intellectuals and many Russian scholars extol[ing] him as the greatest writer of his generation, the voice of Soviet life.&quot; They &quot;acknowledge that his speaking tours have won him converts among audiences impressed with his dramatic readings and charismatic personality. Tina Tupikina Glaessner (1967) refers to him as &quot;one of the greatest poets of the modern age&quot;. She states that &quot;Bratsk Station&quot; offers the greatest insight into Soviet life of any work in modern Russian literature. Two decades later, in his 1988 article, Michael Pursglove echoes her sentiments, referring to Stantsiya Zima as &quot;one of the landmarks of Soviet literature.&quot;

Yevtushenko&#x27;s defenders point to &quot;how much he did to oppose the Stalin legacy, his animus fueled by the knowledge that both of his grandfathers had perished in Stalin&#x27;s purges of the 1930s. He was expelled from his university in 1956 for joining the defense of a banned novel, Vladimir Dudintsev&#x27;s &quot;Not by Bread Alone&quot;. He refused to join in the official campaign against Boris Pasternak, the author of &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and the recipient of the 1958 Nobel Prize in Literature. Yevtushenko denounced the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968; interceded with the KGB chief, Yuri Andropov, on behalf of another Nobel laureate, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn; and opposed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
Yevtushenko was known for his many alleged liaisons. Yevtushenko was married four times: in 1954 he married Bella Akhmadulina, who published her first collection of poems in 1962. After divorce he married Galina Sokol-Lukonina. Yevtushenko&#x27;s third wife was English translator Jan Butler (married in 1978) and his fourth Maria Novikova whom he married in 1986. He had five sons: Dmitry, Sasha, Pyotr, Anton and Yevgeny. His wife taught Russian at Edison Preparatory School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Yevtushenko himself spent half the year at the University of Tulsa, lecturing on poetry and European cinema.

Yevtushenko died on the morning of 1 April 2017, at the Hillcrest Medical Center in Tulsa. His widow, Maria Novikova, reported that he died peacefully in his sleep of heart failure. His son Yevgeny reported that Yevtushenko had been diagnosed with cancer about six years before and that he had undergone surgery to remove part of a kidney, but the disease had recently returned. &quot;His wife, Maria Novikova, and their two sons, Dmitry and Yevgeny, were reportedly with him when he died.&quot; Following his death, Yevtushenko was described by his friend and translator Robin Milner-Gulland as &quot;an absolute natural talent at performance&quot; on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Last Word&quot; programme. Milner-Gulland also wrote, in an obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, that &quot;there was a brief stage when the development of Russian literature seemed almost synonymous with his name&quot;, and that amidst his characteristics of &quot;sharpness, sentiment, populism, self-confidence and sheer enjoyment of the sound of language&quot;, he was &quot;above all a generous spirit&quot;. Raymond H. Anderson stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that his &quot;defiant&quot; poetry &quot;inspired a generation of young Russians in their fight against Stalinism during the Cold War&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
In 1962 Yevtushenko was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

<doc id="531888" wikidata="Q6497468" url="?curid=531888" title="Disguise">
<text>A disguise can be anything incognito which conceals one&#x27;s identity or changes a person&#x27;s physical appearance, including a wig, glasses, makeup, fake moustache, costume or other items. Camouflage is a type of disguise for people, animals and objects. Hats, glasses, changes in hair style or wigs, plastic surgery, and make-up are also used.

Disguises can be used by criminals, terrorists, secret agents and special forces operators seeking to avoid identification. A person working for an agency trying to get information might go &quot;undercover&quot; to get information without being recognised by the public; a celebrity may go &quot;incognito&quot; in order to avoid unwelcome press attention. Protests often feature people dressed in humorous costumes while political publicity stunts and pranks sometimes employ disguises and imposture. In comic books and films, disguises are often used by superheroes, and in science fiction they may be used by aliens. Dressing up in costumes is a Halloween tradition.

== Types of disguise ==

=== Clothing ===
The most basic type of disguise is to use clothing to conceal one&#x27;s identity. Such a method is commonly used by undercover police investigators, government agents and special forces operators, who go &quot;plainclothes&quot; during a clandestine operation to disguise themselves as an ordinary citizen rather than wearing their typical uniform. Most investigators and agents have a diverse disguise kit that includes makeup and different forms of clothing. Face-obscuring accoutrements can thwart Facial recognition systems, making them often used by protesters.

=== Costume ===
Costumes are usually intended to change one&#x27;s identity so that they appear to be a certain fictional character and can assume the role of that character. They are an essential tool of actors in entertainment, such as in film and on stage. Costumes can range from simple clothing changes to more elaborate full-body outfits such as mascots.

=== Realistic ===
A realistic disguise can totally change the identity of a person down to their basic appearance, making it impossible to tell who they really are. While realistic latex masks are more commonly seen as a plot device in fiction, they have also been used in real life as well. Creature suits that disguise a person as an animal or monster are used in entertainment, cosplay, as well as hoaxes.

==In fiction==

=== Myths and legends ===
The concept of the human guise is often used by various shapeshifting mythical beings, such as supernatural creatures and deities, to test or fool humans, or allow themselves to pass amongst them without suspicion.

In epic poetry, Odysseus uses the disguise of a beggar to test his family&#x27;s and servants&#x27; loyalty upon his return from a 10-year voyage.

=== Superhero fiction ===
In comic books and superhero fiction, disguises are used to hide secret identities and keep special powers secret from ordinary people. For example, Superman passes himself off as Clark Kent, and Spider-Man disguises himself in a costume so that he cannot be recognized as Peter Parker.

The Clay Camel, one of Mandrake the Magician&#x27;s foes, is considered the Master of the Disguise, because he is able to mimic anyone and can change his appearance in seconds.

In Marvel Comics, a common enemy of Spider-Man is The Chameleon, whose main tactic is his ability to easily blend into crowds, change his voice, and make masks that look identical to other people.

=== Detective and spy fiction ===
Disguise is sometimes used in criminal activity and in spying, and is a common trend in detective and spy fiction. Arsene Lupin is feared in Maurice Leblanc&#x27;s stories because of his extreme ability to disguise himself; this is a trademark of Lupin.

Sherlock Holmes often disguised himself as someone else to avoid being recognized. Examples include dressing as a peddler in order to avoid being spotted on the moor so that he could get his investigative work done in &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;, or as an Indian sailor so that he could speak with Professor Moriarty about his evil plan in &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon&quot;.

=== Science fiction ===
In science fiction, aliens often take on a human appearance wearing &quot;human suits&quot; as a disguise. An example is the franchise &quot;V&quot;, in which the alien Visitors are actually lizard-like in appearance beneath their realistic latex (or in the reboot, biological) disguises.

Robots can also commonly pass themselves off as human using a realistic outer skin, sometimes leading to a plot twist if a character is revealed as an android. Robotic characters may be used as spies or moles within otherwise human groups. An example of such a plot device is the disguise of the Terminator.

<text>Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli AG, doing business as Lindt, is a Swiss chocolatier and confectionery company founded in 1845 and known for its chocolate truffles and chocolate bars, among other sweets. It is based in Kilchberg, where its main factory and museum are located. Lindt is one of the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturers.

==History==
===Founding and early years===

The origins of the company date back to 1836, when David Sprüngli (1776–1862) and his son Rudolf Sprüngli-Ammann (1816–1897) bought a small confectionery shop in the old town of Zürich, producing chocolates under the name David Sprüngli &amp; Son. Before they moved to Paradeplatz in 1845, they established a small factory where they produced their chocolate in solidified form in 1838.

When Rudolf Sprüngli-Ammann retired in 1892, he gave two equal parts of the business to his sons. The younger brother David Robert received two confectionery stores that became known under the name Confiserie Sprüngli. The elder brother Johann Rudolf received the chocolate factory. To raise the necessary finances for his expansion plans, Johann Rudolf then converted his private company into &quot;Chocolat Sprüngli AG&quot; in 1899. In that same year, he acquired the chocolate factory of Rodolphe Lindt (1855–1909) in Bern, which Lindt had founded in 1879, and the company changed its name to &quot;Aktiengesellschaft Vereinigte Berner und Zürcher Chocoladefabriken Lindt &amp; Sprüngli&quot; (United Bern and Zurich Lindt and Sprungli Chocolate Factory Ltd.).

Although solid milk chocolate had been invented in Switzerland in 1875, Lindt first began producing milk chocolate in 1934. Before, it only produced dark chocolate.

In 1936, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli signed a production licence agreement with the German company Leonard Monheim AG. In 1986, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli took over production and since then, the majority of its internationally distributed products are manufactured in Aachen near the Westbahnhof.

===Expansion===
In 1994, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli acquired the Austrian chocolatier Hofbauer Österreich and integrated it, along with its Küfferle brand, into the company. In 1997 and 1998, respectively, the company acquired the Italian chocolatier Caffarel and the American chocolatier Ghirardelli, and integrated both of them into the company as wholly-owned subsidiaries. Since then, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli has expanded the once-regional Ghirardelli to the international market.

On 17 March 2009, Lindt announced the closure of fifty of its eighty retail boutiques in the United States because of weaker demand in the wake of the late-2000s recession.

On 26 March 2012, the Supreme Court in Vienna ruled in a decade-long case against Austrian manufacturer Hauswirth that the golden chocolate bunny with a red ribbon, also known as the Gold Bunny, may only be sold in Austria in this form by Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. On 24 May 2012, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli was defeated at the European Court of Justice in its attempt to obtain trademark protection for the Gold Bunny throughout Europe. In the application proceedings, which had been ongoing since 2004, the company was unable to prove that the average European consumer would identify the manufacturer of the bunny from its appearance. EU-wide protection was therefore not possible. On 28 March 2013, the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe dismissed an appeal by Lindt &amp; Sprüngli against a ruling by the Frankfurt am Main Higher Regional Court allowing the Franconian company Riegelein to sell a sitting chocolate bunny. The German manufacturer offers its bunny in a slightly darker, bronze-coloured foil. The Federal Court of Justice&#x27;s decision ruled out any likelihood of confusion between the two products.

On 14 July 2014, Lindt bought Russell Stover Candies, maker of Whitman&#x27;s Chocolate, for about $1 billion, the company&#x27;s largest acquisition to date. Due to the 60% praline market share of Russel Stover, Lindt became the third largest chocolate company in North America, while also having a presence with its other brands.

=== Corporate developments ===
In September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Lindt and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world&#x27;s two largest cocoa producers. Mighty Earth&#x27;s 2019 annual &quot;Easter Chocolate Shopping Guide&quot; awarded The Good Egg Award to Lindt &quot;for greatest improvement in sustainable policies&quot;. However, in terms of agroforestry, Lindt scored only a yellow rating, the second-highest of 4, for Agroforestry and a red (&#x27;needs to catch up with the industry&#x27;) for Agrochemical Management on the 2022 Chocolate Scorecard, which since 2020 is a collaboration between Mighty Earth, Be Slavery Free and other NGOs. 

In November 2018, Lindt opened its first American travel retail store in JFK Airport&#x27;s Terminal 1 and its flagship Canadian shop in Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Toronto.

In August 2020, the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) opened up an antitrust case against Lindt after a failed response from the company a year earlier. The regulators have found quality differences for the same Lindt products in Russia over what is being sold in Western markets without informing Russian consumers. According to the FAS, such behaviour of foreign producers can lead to a redistribution of demand in the market and lead to unjustified benefits over other competitors, as companies like Lindt can still garner Russian demand for their products through brand recognition alone without delivering the same quality as in Western Europe. Lindt responded and denied that there are differences for its products sold in Russia and the EU, except for labeling. However, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Lindt announced on 9 March 2022 that it would temporarily close its eight Russian shops and suspend deliveries to Russia, and on 13 August 2022, the company announced that it would permanently exit the Russian market.

Lindt achieved sales of CHF 4.6 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.2 per cent over the previous year. Net profit increased by 53.2 per cent to CHF 490.5 million. In the previous year, sales fell by 6.1 per cent to CHF 4.02 billion.

In 2022, Lindt &amp; Sprüngli was criticised for wasting food. In order to avoid discount campaigns, employees of the company used cardboard knives or ballpoint pens to destroy Lindt products in several Edeka stores in northern Hesse that were still a few weeks from reaching their expiration date. Lindt&#x27;s statement that the company only offers &quot;goods that meet quality standards&quot;, which is why &quot;products that are no longer fit for consumption or sale are marked as unfit for sale by the field sales force and removed from the store&quot;, did not dispel the allegation.

In December 2022, Lindt was among one of many dark chocolate bars that have contained either high amounts of lead or cadmium metals, when compared against California&#x27;s maximum daily allowable dose level, according to Consumer Reports study &quot;Lead and Cadmium Could Be in Your Dark Chocolate&quot;. The cadmium levels are still within the EU limit of 0.80mg/kg for dark chocolate.

In 2023, Lindt partnered with ChoViva, a German cocoa-free chocolate brand, and launched vegan chocolates using oats and sunflower seeds.

In July 2023, the company announced that it would no longer target advertising to children under 16. In doing so, the company aims to align itself with market &quot;Best Practice&quot;.

In January 2024, Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen conducted an investigation in Ghana and uncovered child labour on the plantations where cocoa is produced for Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. According to the report, the company&#x27;s monitoring programme in Ghana, where Lindt sources from around 80,000 farmers, proved to be inadequate.

In 2024, an extension to the Olten plant, which Lindt says is the company&#x27;s largest cocoa mass plant, was opened.

==Factories==
Lindt &amp; Sprüngli has twelve factories: Kilchberg, Switzerland; Aachen, Germany; Oloron-Sainte-Marie, France; Induno Olona, Italy; Gloggnitz, Austria; and Stratham, New Hampshire, in the United States. The factory in Gloggnitz manufactures products under the Hofbauer &amp; Küfferle brand, in addition to the Lindt brand. Caffarel&#x27;s factory is located in Luserna San Giovanni, Italy, and Ghirardelli&#x27;s factory is located in San Leandro, California, in the United States. Furthermore, there are four more factories of Russell Stover in the United States, including locations in Corsicana, Texas; Abilene, Kansas; and Iola, Kansas.

Since 2020, the main factory of Kilchberg has included a visitor centre and museum, referred to as &quot;Lindt Home of Chocolate&quot;. The museum notably displays the world&#x27;s largest chocolate fountain, measuring over nine metres tall and containing 1,500 litres of chocolate, flowing from a giant whisk. The museum takes the visitor through the history of chocolate and the chocolate industry. There are plenty of opportunities to taste various kinds of chocolate at the end of the tour.

==Notable products==

==Lindt chocolate cafés and stores==
Lindt has opened over 410 chocolate cafés and shops all over the world. The cafés&#x27; menu mostly focuses on chocolate and desserts. Lindt chocolate cafés also sell handmade chocolates, macaroons, cakes, and ice cream.

On 15 December 2014, eighteen people, including eight staff, were held hostage at a Lindt cafe in Sydney. Three people, including the gunman, died in the incident.

<text>The Irish Guards (IG) is one of the Foot Guards regiments of the British Army and is part of the Guards Division. Together with the Royal Irish Regiment, it is one of the two Irish infantry regiments in the British Army. The regiment has participated in campaigns in the First World War, the Second World War, the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan as well as numerous other operations throughout its history. The Irish Guards claim six Victoria Cross recipients, four from the First World War and two from the Second World War.

==History==
The Irish Guards were formed on 1 April 1900 by order of Queen Victoria to commemorate the Irishmen who fought in the Second Boer War for the British Empire.

===First World War===

Following the outbreak of the First World War, 1st Battalion Irish Guards was deployed to France almost immediately, and they remained on the Western Front for the duration of the war. During the early part of the war, the battalion took part in the Battle of Mons and formed the Allied rearguard during the Great Retreat. The battalion then took part in one of the bloodiest battles of 1914, the First Battle of Ypres, which began on 19 October, inflicting major casualties among the old Regular Army.

The 1st Battalion was involved in fighting for the duration of &#x27;First Ypres&#x27;, at Langemarck, Gheluvelt and Nonne Bosschen. The 1st Battalion suffered huge casualties between 1–8 November holding the line against near defeat by German forces, while defending Klein Zillebeke.

In May 1915, the 1st Battalion took part in the Battle of Festubert, though did not see much action. Two further battalions were formed for the regiment in July. In September that year, all three battalions took part in the Battle of Loos, which lasted from 25 September until early October.

The Irish Guards went into action again on 1 July 1916 when the Battle of the Somme began. The 1st Battalion took part in an action at Flers–Courcelette where they suffered severe casualties in the attack in the face of withering fire from the German machine-guns. The battalion also took part in the action at Morval before they were relieved by the 2nd Battalion.

In 1917 the Irish Guards took part in the Battle of Pilckem which began on 31 July during the Third Battle of Ypres. The Irish Guards also took part in the Battle of Cambrai that year. In 1918 the regiment fought in a number of engagements during the Second Battle of the Somme, including at Arras and Albert. The regiment then went on to take part in a number of battles during the British offensives against the Hindenburg Line. On 11 November 1918 the Armistice with Germany was signed. The 1st Battalion was at Maubeuge when the Armistice was signed.

The regiment&#x27;s continued existence was threatened briefly when Winston Churchill, who served as Secretary of State for War between 1919 and 1921, sought the elimination of the Irish Guards and Welsh Guards as an economy measure. This proposal, however, did not find favour in government or army circles and was dropped. Between the wars, the regiment was deployed at various times to Turkey, Gibraltar, Egypt and Palestine.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, the regiment fought in Norway, France, North Africa, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands and Germany. The regiment first saw combat during the Norwegian Campaign. Following a challenging sea voyage to Norway, the 1st Battalion arrived in May 1940 and fought for two days at the town of Pothus before they were forced to retreat. The Irish Guards conducted a fighting withdrawal and served as the Allied rearguard.

The battalion was evacuated along with the rest of the expeditionary force in June. While the 1st Battalion was fighting in Norway, the 2nd Battalion was deployed to the Hook of Holland to cover the evacuation of the Dutch royal family and Government in May 1940. The 2nd Battalion was then deployed to France and ordered to defend the port of Boulogne. The guardsmen held out against overwhelming odds for three days, buying valuable time for the Dunkirk Evacuation, before they were evacuated themselves. In November 1942, Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg joined the British Army as a volunteer in the Irish Guards.

In March 1943 the 1st Battalion landed, with the rest of the 24th Guards Brigade, in Tunisia, to fight in the final stages of the campaign in North Africa. The battalion saw extensive action while fighting through Tunisia and was subsequently deployed to the Italian Front in December of that year. The battalion took part in the Anzio landings on 22 January 1944. They also participated in the fierce fighting around the Allied beachhead and suffered severe casualties fighting off a German counterattack at Campoleone after which the depleted battalion was returned to the UK in April.

The Irish Guards returned to France in June 1944 when the 2nd and 3rd Battalions took part in the Normandy Campaign. Both battalions served as part of the Guards Armoured Division and took part in the attempt to capture Caen as part of Operation Goodwood. They also saw action in the Mont Pincon area. On 29 August, the 3rd Battalion crossed the Seine and began the advance into Belgium with the rest of the Guards Armoured Division towards Brussels.

The Irish Guards were part of the ground force of Operation Market Garden, &#x27;Market&#x27; being the airborne assault and &#x27;Garden&#x27; the ground attack. The Irish Guards led the vanguard of XXX Corps in their advance towards Arnhem, which was the objective of the British 1st Airborne Division, furthest from XXX Corps&#x27; start line. The Corps crossed the Belgian-Dutch border, advancing from Neerpelt on 17 September but the Irish Guards encountered heavy resistance which slowed the advance. Following the conclusion of Market Garden, the Irish Guards remained in the Netherlands until taking part in the Allied advance into Germany and seeing heavy action during the Rhineland Campaign with Guardsman Edward Charlton earning the final Victoria Cross to be awarded in the European theatre.

===1945–2019===
After the war, the regiment was reduced to a single battalion, with the 2nd Battalion being placed in suspended animation and the 3rd Battalion being disbanded. In 1947, the 1st Battalion deployed to Palestine to perform internal security duties there. It was then posted to the Suez Canal Zone in Egypt, remaining there until the British withdrawal in 1956. The regiment continued to serve in troubled regions such as Cyprus and Aden throughout the 1950s and 1960s. During this time they were also part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in Germany on a number of occasions. They also served as the garrison of Hong Kong from 1970 to 1972.

The Irish Guards were one of the few regiments in the British Army initially exempt from service in Northern Ireland during The Troubles. However, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb blasted a bus carrying members of the regiment band to Chelsea Barracks in October 1981. 39 people (23 soldiers and 16 others) were wounded and two civilians were killed. 1992 saw the regiment finally carry out its first tour-of-duty in Northern Ireland, based in County Fermanagh.

The Irish Guards were involved in the Balkans Conflicts when they were deployed to Macedonia and Kosovo in 1999 and were the first British unit to enter the Kosovan capital city of Pristina on 12 June. The regiment played a significant role in the initial stages of the Iraq War as part of the 7th Armoured Brigade and they led the British advance into Basra in March 2003. The Irish Guards deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic 10 in 2007. In 2010, the regiment deployed on their first tour of duty to Afghanistan. Number 2 Company deployed to Afghanistan in 2013 as a Brigade Operations Company.

In 2014 the entire regiment deployed to Cyprus to patrol the buffer zone as part of Operation Tosca 20. Following the Manchester Arena bombing, the Irish Guards were deployed in London to guard key locations, including the Ministry of Defence building in Whitehall, as part of Operation Temperer. Later that year Number 1 Company deployed to the Falkland Islands as the Roulement Infantry Company while Number 2 Company deployed to Thailand on an overseas training exercise where they worked alongside the Thai Army.

=== 2019–2020 ===
December 2019 saw the Irish Guards deploy on two operations concurrently. Number 1 Company deployed to South Sudan on Operation Trenton and the rest of the battalion deployed to Iraq on Operation Shader, training Iraqi Security Forces in the mission to defeat Daesh. However, the deployment rapidly changed in January 2020 with the escalation of the 2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis following the American strike on Major General Qasem Soleimani. The Irish Guards&#x27; mission changed from training to force protection in order to protect British assets in Iraq from possible retaliation by Iran. Eventual de-escalation saw the Irish Guards resume their original mission.

==Role and organisation==
In the light infantry role the 1st Battalion comprised five companies; Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 Companies, and the Headquarters Company. Following the Integrated Review and after the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Parade 2022, 1st Battalion took on the security force assistance role for 4 years. With a much-reduced establishment, this role required a substantial readjustment to the battalion. Concurrently, the Irish Guards raised two public duties incremental companies (PDICs). These are Numbers 9 and 12 Companies, taking on Irish Guardsmen fresh out of the Infantry Training Centre before the young soldiers progress to the 1st Battalion. Nos. 9 and 12 Company carry on the customs and traditions of the former 2nd Battalion, Irish Guards. Finally there is Number 15 (Loos) Company in the Army Reserve, based at Flodden Road, London, which is operationally organisaed as part of 1st Battalion, London Guards.

==Recruitment==
The regiment recruits in Northern Ireland and among residents of Irish extraction in mainland Britain. Although restrictions in Ireland&#x27;s Defence Act make it illegal to induce, procure or persuade enlistment of any citizen of Ireland into the military of another state, people from the Republic do frequently enlist in the Regiment.

==Uniform==

Like the other Foot Guards regiments, the &quot;Home Service Dress&quot; of the Irish Guards is a scarlet tunic and bearskin. Buttons are worn in fours, reflecting the regiment&#x27;s position as the fourth most senior Guards regiment, and the collar is adorned with embroided shamrock. They also sport a St. Patrick&#x27;s blue hackle (plume) on the right side of the bearskin. A plume of St Patrick&#x27;s blue was selected because blue is the colour of the mantle and sash of the Order of St Patrick, a chivalric order, founded by George III of the United Kingdom for the Kingdom of Ireland in February 1783 from which the regiment also draws its cap star and motto. The Irish Guards pipers wear saffron kilts, green hose with saffron flashes and heavy black shoes known as brogues with no spats, a rifle green doublet with buttons in fours and a hat known as a caubeen.The regimental capstar is worn over the piper&#x27;s right eye and is topped by a blue hackle. A green cloak with four silver buttons is worn over the shoulders and is secured by two green straps that cross over the chest.

In &quot;Walking-out Dress&quot;, the Irish Guards can be identified by the green band on their forage caps. Officers also traditionally carry a blackthorn cane.

Like the other Guards regiments, they wear a khaki beret with the blue/red/blue Household Division backing patch on it. On the beret, ranks from Guardsman to Lance Sergeant wear a brass or staybrite cap badge, Sergeants and Colour Sergeants wear a bi-metal cap badge, Warrant Officers wear a silver plate gilt and enamel cap badge and commissioned officers of the regiment wear an embroidered cap badge.

Prince William, who was then Colonel of the Irish Guards, wore the uniform of the Irish Guards at his wedding to Catherine Middleton.

==Motto==
The regiment takes its motto, &quot;Quis Separabit?&quot;, or &quot;Who shall separate us?&quot; from the Order of St Patrick.

==Nickname==
The Irish Guards are known throughout the British Army as &quot;the Micks&quot; or &quot;Fighting Micks.&quot; The term &quot;Mick&quot; can be an offensive term for a person of Irish descent; however it is proudly used internally within the regiment and has no negative connotation when referring to the Irish Guards.

==Training==
Recruits to the Guards Division go through a thirty-week training programme at the Infantry Training Centre (ITC). The training is two weeks more than the training for the Regular infantry regiments of the British Army; the extra training, carried out throughout the course, is devoted to drill and ceremonies.

==Mascot==

Since 1902, an Irish Wolfhound has been presented as a mascot to the regiment by the Irish Wolfhound Club, who originally hoped the publicity would increase the breed&#x27;s popularity with the public. The first mascot was called Brian Boru.

In 1961, the wolfhound was admitted to the select club of official Army mascots, entitling him to the services of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps, as well as quartering and food at public expense. Originally, the mascot was in the care of a drummer boy, but is now looked after by one of the regiment&#x27;s drummers and his family. The Irish Guards are the only Guards regiment permitted to have their mascot lead them on parade. During Trooping the Colour, the mascot marches only from Wellington Barracks as far as Horse Guards Parade. He then falls out of the formation and does not participate in the Trooping itself. Domhnall, the regiment&#x27;s seventeenth mascot, retired back to Ireland, in 2019.

==Traditions and affiliations==

St Patrick&#x27;s Day is the traditional regimental celebration. It is customary for the regiment to begin the day&#x27;s celebrations with the Guardsmen being woken by their officers and served gunfire. Fresh shamrock is then presented to members of the regiment, whether they are in the UK or abroad on operations.

Except in wartime, the presentation of shamrock is traditionally made by a member of the royal family. This task was first performed in 1901 by Queen Alexandra and later by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. After the latter&#x27;s death, the presentation was made by Anne, Princess Royal. Starting in 2012, the presentation has been made by Catherine, Princess of Wales.

In 1950 George VI marked the fiftieth anniversary of the formation of the Irish Guards by presenting the shamrocks on St Patrick&#x27;s Day. This honour was mirrored by King George&#x27;s surviving wife, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, fifty years later when she presented shamrocks to the regiment on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day in their centenary year of 2000.

The Irish Guards and other Guards regiments have a long-standing connection to The Parachute Regiment. Irish Guardsmen who have completed P Company can be seconded to the Guards Parachute Platoon, which is currently attached to the 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. The Guards Parachute Platoon maintains the tradition established by Number 1 (Guards) Independent Parachute Company that was part of the original Pathfinder Group of 16th Parachute Brigade, which has since been designated as the 16th Air Assault Brigade.

<doc id="531906" wikidata="Q960850" url="?curid=531906" title="Molise Croats">
<text>Molise Croats () or Molise [[Slavs]] () are a Croat community in the Molise province of Campobasso of Italy, which constitutes the majority in the three villages of Acquaviva Collecroce (&quot;Kruč&quot;), San Felice del Molise (&quot;Filić&quot;) and Montemitro (&quot;Mundimitar&quot;). There are about 1,000 active and 2,000 passive speakers of the Slavomolisano dialect. The community originated from Dalmatian refugees fleeing from the Ottoman conquests in the late 15th and 16th centuries.

==Identity and status==
The community does not have an ethnonym of their own, but are traditionally accustomed to the term &quot;Zlava&quot; and &quot;Škjavuna&quot; (&quot;Slavs&quot;). Since 1999, the governments of Italy and Croatia recognize the community as a Croatian minority in Italy. However, the people consider themselves to be Italo-Slavs or Croatian-speaking Italians, and the term &quot;Molise Croat&quot; is a recent exonym rather than their own name for themselves, dating to the middle 19th century. Historical terms for this community include &quot;Schiavoni&quot;, &quot;Sklavuni&quot;, &quot;Skiavuni&quot; and &quot;Šćavuni&quot; (&quot;Slavs&quot;), and also demonymic &quot;de Sclavonia&quot;, &quot;de Dalmatia&quot; or &quot;partibus Illirie&quot;. In 1967 the minority has also been called &quot;Serbo-Croats of Molise&quot; (Serbo-croati del Molise).

The communities did not use a specific ethnonym, rather tribal determinants &quot;naša krv&quot; (our blood), &quot;naša čeljad&quot; (our dwellers), &quot;braća naša&quot; (our brothers), while for language speaking &quot;na našo&quot; (on our way). Another important aspect of identity is the tradition according which the community vaguely settled &quot;z one ban(d)e mora&quot; (from the other side of the sea). In 1904, Josip Smodlaka recorded a testimony &quot;su z&#x27; Dalmacije pur naši stari&quot; (from Dalmatia are our ancestors).

==History==
The Adriatic Sea since the Early Middle Ages connected the Croatian and Italian coast. The historical sources from 10-11th centuries mention Slavic incursions in Calabria, and Gargano peninsula. Gerhard Rohlfs in dialects from Gargano found many old Croatian lexical remains, and two toponyms &quot;Peschici&quot; (&quot;*pěskъ-&quot;) and &quot;Lesina&quot; (&quot;*lěsь&quot;, forest), which indicate Chakavian dialect. In the 12th century are confirmed toponyms &quot;Castelluccio degli Schiavoni&quot; and &quot;San Vito degli Schiavoni&quot;. Between the 13th and 15th centuries, toponyms &quot;Slavi cum casalibus&quot; (Otranto, 1290), &quot;Castellucium de Slavis&quot; (Capitanata, 1305), &quot;casale Sclavorum&quot; (Lavorno, 1306), &quot;clerici de Schalvis&quot; (Trivento, 1328), &quot;S. Martini in Sclavis&quot; (Marsia, 13th century), &quot;S. Nikolò degli Schiavoni&quot; (Vasto, 1362). In 1487 the residents of Ancona differed the &quot;Slavi&quot;, previously settled, and the newcomers &quot;Morlacchi&quot;. In the 16th century, Abraham Ortelius in his Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (1570), West of Gargano in today&#x27;s province of Molise mentioned &quot;Dalmatia&quot;, and on Gargano also exist cape &quot;Porto Croatico&quot; and cove &quot;Valle Croatica&quot;.

According to evidence, Molise Croats arrived in the early 16th century. The documents from the episcopal archive of Termoli indicate that Molise Croats arrived 1518 in &quot;Stifilić&quot; (San Felice). A stone inscription on the church in Palata, destroyed in the 1930s, read &quot;Hoc Primum Dalmatiae Gentis Incoluere Castrum Ac Fundamentis Erexere Templum Anno 1531&quot; (Residents of Dalmatia first settled the town and founded the church in 1531). The mention of Croatian Ban Ivan Karlović (d. 1531) and absence of any Turkish word in folk poetry additionally proves this dating, and unity of elements in Croatian folk poetry from diverse regions at the end of 15th and 16th century.

Serafino Razzi in his work &quot;Cronica Vastese&quot; (1576–1577) wrote that the Slavs who came across the sea founded in Molise region settlements San Felice, Montemitro, Acquaviva Collecroce, Palata, Tavenna, Ripalta, San Giacomo degli Schiavoni, Montelongo, San Biase, Petacciato, Cerritello, Sant&#x27;Angelo and Montenero di Bisaccia. Other Slavs settled in Vasto, Forcabobolani, San Silvestro, Vacri, Casacanditella, Francavilla al Mare, and in Abruzzo among others. For the Slavic congregation in Rome was established Illyrian brotherhood of St. Jerome, which was confirmed by Pope Nicholas V in 1452. Slavs founded fifteen settlements in Molise, according to Giacomo Scotti with around seven or eight thousand people, of which only three (San Felice, Montemitro, Acquaviva Collecroce) today have a Slavic-speaking community.

The existence of this Slavic colony was first mentioned in the 1850s, and was unknown outside Italy until 1855 when linguist Medo Pucić from Dubrovnik journeyed to Italy and overheard a tailor in Naples speaking with his wife in a language very similar to Pucić&#x27;s own. The tailor then told him that he came from the village of &quot;Živavoda Kruč&quot;, then part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

===Origin===
The geographical origin of the Molise Croats (Slavs) has been vastly theorized. Vikentij Makušev while researching Slavic immigrants in Naples and Palermo, heard &quot;Old-Slavonic&quot; words &quot;rab&quot;, &quot;teg&quot;, &quot;kut&quot;, &quot;dom&quot;, &quot;gredem&quot; etc., and being uninformed about their common use in Chakavian speech of Dalmatia, thought that they were Bulgarians. Risto Kovačić, Miroslav Pantić, Giovanni de Rubertis and Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, considered Molise Croats to be Serbs from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbian littoral. Josip Gelecich considered the area of Dubrovnik-Bay of Kotor. There&#x27;s almost no historical and linguistical evidence that Molise Croats originated from continental Balkans or Montenegro.

A more specific and generally accepted area of origin is considered to have been Dalmatia. As such, Josip Aranza considered Zadar region, R. T. Badurina southern Istria, Mate Hraste the hinterland of Zadar and Šibenik, while Walter Breu the Neretva valley. According to linguistic features, it has been established that the area of origin was Zabiokovlje and Makarska Riviera (Josip Smodlaka, Josip Barač, Milan Rešetar, Žarko Muljačić, Dalibor Brozović, Petar Šimunović).

==Language==
The language of Molise Croats is considered to be important because of its archaism, preserved old folk songs and tradition. The basic vocabulary was done by Milan Rešetar (in monography), Agostina Piccoli (along Antonio Sammartino, Snježana Marčec and Mira Menac-Mihalić) in &quot;Rječnik moliškohrvatskoga govora Mundimitra&quot; (&quot;Dizionario dell&#x27; idioma croato-molisano di Montemitro&quot;), and &quot;Dizionario croato molisano di Acquaviva Collecroce&quot;, the grammar &quot;Gramatika moliškohrvatskoga jezika &quot; (Grammatica della lingua croato-molisana), as well work &quot;Jezik i porijeklo stanovnika slavenskih naseobina u pokrajini Molise&quot; by Anita Sujoldžić, Božidar Finka, Petar Šimunović and Pavao Rudan.

The language of Molise Croats belongs to Western Shtokavian dialect of Ikavian accent, with many features and lexemes of Chakavian dialect. The lexicon comparison points to the similarity with language of Sumartin on Brač, Sućuraj on Hvar, and Račišće on Korčula, settlements founded almost in the same time as those in Molise, and together point to the similarity of several settlements in South-Western and Western Istria (see Southwestern Istrian dialect), formed by the population of Makarska hinterland and Western Herzegovina.

Giacomo Scotti noted that the ethnic identity and language was only preserved in San Felice, Montemitro and Acquaviva Collecroce thanks to the geographical and transport distance of the villages from the sea. Josip Smodlaka noted that during his visit in the early 1900s the residents of Palata still knew to speak in Croatian about basic terms like home and field works, but if the conversation touched more complex concepts they had to use Italian.

===Antroponyms===
The personal names, surnames and toponyms additionally confirm the origin of Molise Croats. Preserved Italianized surnames in Acquaviva Collecroce include &quot;Jaccusso&quot; (Jakaš), &quot;Lali&quot; (Lalić), &quot;Matijacci&quot; (Matijačić), &quot;Mileti&quot; (Miletić), &quot;Mirco&quot; (Mirko), &quot;Papiccio&quot; (Papić), &quot;Pecca&quot; (Pekić, Peršić), &quot;Radi&quot; (Radić), &quot;Tomizzi&quot; (Tomičić), &quot;Veta&quot; (Iveta); in San Felice include &quot;Blasetta&quot; (Blažeta), &quot;Gliosca&quot; (Joško), &quot;Petrella&quot; (Petrela), &quot;Radata&quot; (Radetić), &quot;Zara&quot; (Zaro, Zadro); in Montemitro include &quot;Blascetta&quot; (Blažeta), &quot;Giorgetta&quot; (Jureta), &quot;Lali&quot;, &quot;Miletti&quot;, &quot;Mirco&quot;, &quot;Staniscia&quot; (Stanišić), &quot;Gorgolizza&quot; (Gurgurica, Grgurić), &quot;Sciscia&quot; (Šišić), &quot;Juricci&quot; (Jurić), &quot;Joviccio&quot; (Jović) etc.

The surnames differ; patronymics with suffix &quot;-ović&quot; (&quot;Marovicchio&quot;, &quot;Marcovicchio&quot;, &quot;Pastrovicchio&quot;), diminutive-hypocoristic (&quot;Vucenichio&quot;, &quot;Popicchio&quot;, &quot;Milicchio&quot;), nicknames attribute (&quot;Vecera&quot;, &quot;Tosti&quot;, &quot;Poganizza&quot;, &quot;Bilac&quot;, &quot;Berhizz&quot;), ethnic-toponyms attribute (&quot;Klissa&quot;, &quot;Lisa&quot;, &quot;Zara&quot;, &quot;Rauzei&quot;, &quot;Schiavone di Corzula, Traù, Ciuppana&quot;, &quot;de Raguza&quot;), Italian lexic origin (&quot;Curic&quot;, &quot;Scaramucchio&quot;).

A rich array of kinship names (including &quot;vlah&quot;, fiancé, and &quot;vlahinja&quot;, fiancée), and many lexemes indicate that among the population of Molise Croats were genuine Vlach communities. It has been preserved the tradition of nickname &quot;Mrlakin&quot; (Morlak; &quot;shepherd&quot;) and old homeland for the &quot;Mirco&quot; family (Baćina lakes near Ploče in Dalmatia). On the Vlach influence point forms &quot;Mrlakina&quot;, &quot;Jakovina&quot;, &quot;Jureta&quot;, &quot;Radeta&quot;, &quot;Peronja&quot;, &quot;Mileta&quot;, &quot;Vučeta&quot;, &quot;Pavluša&quot;, patronyms with suffix &quot;-ica&quot; (&quot;Vučica&quot;, &quot;Grgorica&quot;, &quot;Radonjica&quot;, &quot;Budinica&quot;), name suffix &quot;-ul&quot; (&quot;Radul&quot;, &quot;Micul&quot;), and verb &quot;čičarati / kikarati&quot;.

===Toponyms===
There&#x27;s an abundant number of toponyms which include the ethnonyms &quot;Sciavo&quot;, &quot;Schiavone&quot;, &quot;Slavo&quot;, &quot;Sclavone&quot; and their variations in South-Eastern Italy. The evidence shows that Italians usually used this ethnonyms as synonyms for the name of Croats and residents of Dalmatia. For example, in 1584 in &quot;Palcarino degli Schiavoni&quot; (Irinia) was mentioned a priest &quot;de nazione Schiavone o Dalmatico&quot;.

The names of Molise settlements are Italianized Acquaviva Collecroce (&quot;Živavoda Krȕč&quot;), Montemitro (&quot;Mundìmītar&quot;), San Felice (Stifìlīć &gt; Fìlīć). Toponymy includes several semantic categories; characteristics of the ground (Brdo, Dolaz, Draga, Grba, Kraji, Livade, Polizza, Ravnizza, Vrisi), soil composition (Stina, Drvar), hydronyms (Vrila, Jesera, Jaz, Locqua, Potocco, Coritti, Fontizza), flora (Dubrava, Valle di Miscignavizza, Paprato, Topolizza), fauna (Berdo do kujne, Most do tovari), position of the object (Monte svrhu Roccile, Fonte donio, Fonte zdolu Grade), human activity (Gradina, Ulizza, Puč, Cimiter, Selo, Grad, Stasa), and property owners (Maseria Mirco, Colle di Jure). The toponymy of Molise is almost identical to the toponymy of Makarska Riviera.

==Culture==
The community is adherent to Catholicism.

Upon settling in inhabited current area, Molise Croats engaged in subsistence agriculture (mostly producing grain, as well as some vine-cultivation and other kinds of agriculture) and animal husbandry, as well as home lacemaking and the trade of resulting goods. In modern times, olive and olive oil production are also cultivated. The village residents mostly work in nearby towns, like Termoli and San Salvo.

The long-term exposure to the disintegration processes and Italian foreign language surroundings, as well absence of cultural institutions, resulted in the loss of ethnic identity. The ethnic identity of Molise Croats consists of a common language, shared ancestry and physical appearance, personal names and toponyms, common customs (living and dressing), as well an oral tradition of migration. In 1904, &quot;Slavenska knjižnica&quot; (Biblioteca Slava) was founded in Acquaviva Collecroc; from 1968, the journal &quot;Naš jezik&quot; was released, and again between 1986–1988 as &quot;Naš život&quot; in Slavomolisano dialect. From 2002, a journal entitled &quot;Riča živa&quot; has been released. Local amateur associations preserve the tradition, folklore, and language. In 1999, the &quot;Agostina Piccoli&quot; Foundation was founded, which in 2002 was officially recognized by Italy as an institution for preservation and protection of Molise Croats culture and tradition.

==Population==
In the late 18th century, Giuseppe Maria Galanti in his work &quot;Descrizione dello stato antico ed attuale del Contado di Molise&quot; (1781), as &quot;Schiavoni&quot; settlements considered Acquaviva Collecroce (1380 pop.), Montemitro (460), San Siase (960), San Felice (1009), Tavenna (1325), and noted that the residents of Ripalta (781) spoke equally poorly Slavic and Italian.

Giovenale Vegezzi Ruscalla in his work &quot;Le Colonie Serbo–Dalmate del circondario di Lacino - provincia di Molise&quot; (1864), recorded that only three villages preserved &quot;la lingua della Dalmazia&quot;, and population was, like previously by Galanti, around 4,000 people. For the residents of Tavenna noted that until 1805 they still spoke &quot;slavo-dalmato&quot;, but in the last census (probably from 1861), certain sixty elders who preserved the language did not declare for &quot;lingua dalmata&quot; because was afraid of being considered strangers.

In 1867, Graziadio Isaia Ascoli considered that around 20,000 residents of Molise region were of Slavic origin. This figure is considered to be unfounded.

During the years, due to economic and social issues, many families migrated to Northern Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and overseas to United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, and Western Australia. The population figures reported in the census do not necessarily show accurate data for the language speakers.

<text>AMSAT-OSCAR-40, also known as AO-40 or simply OSCAR 40, was the on-orbit designation of an amateur radio satellite of the OSCAR series. Prior to launch, the spacecraft was known as Phase 3D or &quot;P3D&quot;. AO-40 was built by AMSAT.

AO-40&#x27;s project manager was Peter Guelzow of AMSAT-DL, the German AMSAT organization. Mr Guelzow holds amateur call sign DB2OS.

== History ==

=== Design, construction and launch ===

Following the failure of the Phase 3A launcher, design studies were undertaken and construction started for two successor satellites, that became AO-10 (Phase 3B) and AO-13 (Phase 3C) respectively.

After the launch of AO-13, design commenced for a Phase 4 satellite. This idea was later shelved, and design of Phase 3D (on-orbit name: AO-40) was undertaken under direction of the project team based in Germany, involving amateur radio payloads from many countries in Europe.

Assembly was done at AMSAT&#x27;s Spacecraft Integration Facility in the &#x27;Free Trade Zone Building&#x27; at the Orlando International Airport, Orlando, Florida from 1994 to 2000.

It was launched on 16 November 2000, on an Ariane 5 launch vehicle from Kourou, in French Guiana, and reported cost was US$4.5 Million.

=== Operational problems ===

On 13 December 2000 at 11:23 UTC, transmissions from AO-40 ceased during the exercising of its 400 newton motor. The Command Team were able to infer that there had been an explosion caused by pressure in the propellant pipes caused by malfunction of the control valves. A protective cap that was supposed to be removed from the motor before launch, was left in place. This error occurred because of a difference between the venting mechanism of the 400N motor used in AO-13 and the one in AO-40, complicated by a misunderstanding between the propulsion team and the engine manufacturer. When the motor was fired, pressure built up where it shouldn&#x27;t, and destructive failure occurred. The loss of the motor caused AO-40 to be left in an equatorial orbit that the satellite was not designed for.

As a result of this incident several pieces of radio equipment no longer functioned or were not able to be commissioned. Following strenuous efforts by the Command Team, signals were restored on 25 December 2000 at 2145 UTC when Command Team member Ian Ashley (amateur radio call sign ZL1AOX) of New Zealand successfully sent a &#x27;reset&#x27; signal to the satellite. Onboard cameras were used to establish the attitude of the satellite, and the magnetorquer system was used to spin-stabilize the satellite.

During June 2001, gas from the arcjet thruster was vented during apogee to raise perigee and stabilize the orbit of the satellite. Because of issues with the initial 400N burn, the apogee of the spacecraft was considerably higher than initially designed, but this was not a major issue. Subsequently, the communication packages and cameras were gradually re-activated.

=== Failure ===

On 25 January 2004, telemetry from the main battery was observed to go to an extremely low voltage by Stacey Mills (amateur radio call sign W4SM), a member of the Command Team. This caused the onboard Internal Housekeeping Unit (IHU) computer to cut power to the transponder payloads. Earlier in the same orbit the progressive drop in voltage caused the auxiliary battery to come online in parallel with the main battery. However the auxiliary battery was not being maintained in a charged state. Tying the two batteries in parallel did not result in an obvious change in voltage, but meant that the auxiliary battery could not be tested independently. Many attempts were made to disconnect the main battery, but insufficient voltage was available to drive the relays. It is possible that one day an open-circuit failure may occur in the main battery, in which case the spacecraft may come to life again via the auxiliary batteries. However, for reasons discussed below this is highly unlikely. The command team believes that the main battery failure was probably a consequence of damage done during the initial explosive event, and it is likely that similar damage was done to the auxiliary battery, making an eventual recovery of AO-40 unlikely. It is clear that the initial explosion blew open the end of the spacecraft to which the omni antennas were attached. This exposed the underlying batteries to major fluctuations in temperature and the explosion itself may have caused physical damage to the cells.

Following this final failure, the new keplerian elements have persistently shown an increase in orbital period corresponding to an increase in the semi-major axis of AO-40&#x27;s orbit by approximately 2.7 km. Assuming AO-40 had a mass of 400 kg, this change required approximately 160,000 joules of energy directed along the velocity vector of the orbit. Since an explosion would be unlikely to focus its energy so precisely, it is likely that a considerably larger explosion occurred synchronous with the final battery failure. The source of this energy release is unknown, but it strongly suggests that recovery will not occur. (W4SM)

On 9 March 2004, Colin Hurst (amateur radio call sign VK5HI) of Australia, a member of the command team, heard a change in the level of radio noise at the expected beacon frequency during the period 0310 to 0320 UTC (orbit 1541).

All telemetry captured by the command team, and its network of helpers, is archived on the web at the AMSAT website.

<doc id="531909" wikidata="Q11732156" url="?curid=531909" title="Diaspora language">
<text>The term [[diaspora]] language, coined in the 1980s, is a sociolinguistic idea referring to a variety of languages spoken by peoples with common roots who have dispersed, under various pressures and often globally. The emergence and evolution of a diaspora language is usually part of a larger attempt to retain cultural identity.

==Examples==

===Molisanne (Molise Slavic)===
Though possessing certain elements of Slavic languages, Molise Slavic is also influenced by Italian. Considered an endangered language, Molise Slavic is spoken by approximately 3,500 people in the villages of Montemitro, San Felice del Molise, and Acquaviva Collecroce in southern Molise, as well as elsewhere in southern Italy. The language developed as a result of refugees arriving in Italy from the eastern Adriatic coast during the 15th and 16th centuries.

===Istro-Romanian===
Another diaspora language is Istro-Romanian, spoken by the Istro-Romanians. Like Molise Slavic, it is considered endangered, with only 500 to 1000 speakers remaining. Istro-Romanian developed when the ancestors of these individuals migrated to Istria from Transylvania (some say Serbia) during the 12th century.

===Griko===
Griko language (endonym: /), sometimes spelled Grico, is one of the two dialects of Italiot Greek (the other being Calabrian Greek or ), spoken by Griko people in Salento, province of Lecce, Italy. Some Greek linguists consider it to be a Modern Greek dialect and often call it () or (). Griko and Standard Modern Greek are partially mutually intelligible. The Griko language is the last living trace of the Greek elements that once formed Magna Graecia.

===Gallo-Italic languages in Southern Italy===

Varieties of Gallo-Italic languages are also found in Sicily, corresponding with the central-eastern parts of the island that received large numbers of immigrants from Northern Italy, called Lombards, during the decades following the Norman conquest of Sicily (around 1080 to 1120). Given the time that has lapsed and the influence from the Sicilian language itself, these dialects are best generically described as Southern Gallo-Italic. The major centres where these dialects can still be heard today include Piazza Armerina, Aidone, Sperlinga, San Fratello, Nicosia, and Novara di Sicilia. Northern Italian dialects did not survive in some towns in the province of Catania that developed large Lombard communities during this period, namely Randazzo, Paternò and Bronte. However, the Northern Italian influence in the local varieties of Sicilian are marked. In the case of San Fratello, some linguists suggested that the nowadays dialect has Provençal as its basis, having been a fort manned by Provençal mercenaries in the early decades of the Norman conquest (bearing in mind that it took the Normans 30 years to conquer the whole of the island).

Other dialects, attested from 13th and 14th century, are also found in Basilicata, more precisely in the province of Potenza (Tito, Picerno, Pignola and Vaglio Basilicata), Trecchina, Rivello, Nemoli and San Costantino.

===Arbëresh===
Arbëresh language (; also known as Arbërisht) are the Albanian linguistic varieties spoken by the Arbëreshë people of Italy, brought there by several migratory waves of Albanians from Albania and Greece since the Late Middle Ages. Arbëresh varieties are derived from the old Tosk Albanian varieties spoken in the south-western Balkans, and throughout the centuries they have developed in Italy in contact with the neighboring Italo-Romance speaking communities. Other Tosk Albanian varieties from the Late Middle Ages referred to as Arvanitika (endonym: &quot;arbërisht&quot;) are spoken in Greece by the Arvanites. &quot;E Mbësuame e Krështerë&quot; (1592) by Luca Matranga from Piana degli Albanesi is the earliest known Old Tosk text, a translation of a catechism book from Latin.

The Arbëreshë people are bilingual, also speaking Italian. Arbëresh is classified as Definitely Endangered by the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger&quot;. While Italian law protects the language and culture of the Albanian people in Italy, the language taught at school and university is Standard Albanian, constituting an issue for the Arbëresh communities&#x27; preservation of their native idiom, wich has remained separated from the main Albanian-speaking compact area for around 500 years. Alongside the fact that Arbëresh is rarely written, another issue for the language attrition is the differentiation between the Albanian varieties used in Italy: the Arbëresh local idioms in some areas are so different from each other that Arbëresh people of those areas use Italian or Standard Albanian as lingua franca to communicate with each other.

===AAVE in the African American Diaspora===
A study of African American enclaves in Nova Scotia, Canada, and Samaná, Dominican Republic, shows a high similarity in the African American Vernacular English (AAVE) spoken there and the early versions of AAVE that originated in the south during the 19th century. AAVE in the United States on the other hand has changed substantially due in part to the Great Migration that happened in the twentieth century. Unusually, while most examples have a diaspora causing differences in language due to influence from another culture and languages, these enclaves maintained a form of language closer to the historical source, or branching point.

===Hindlish or Hinglish===
The great number of Hindi speakers in the United Kingdom has produced a strain of the language unlike that spoken on the Indian subcontinent where it began. This has given rise to Hindlish, also known as Hinglish, an informal term for the mixture of Hindi and English that includes such phrases as &quot;city kotwali&quot; or &quot;city police station.&quot; Hinglish is not considered a full-blown diaspora language but it appears to be developing into one.

===Yiddish and the Jewish Diaspora===
Yiddish is a major linguistic creation of the Jewish Diaspora, originating in what is now Germany. It is one of many languages that emerged as a result of the migration of the Jewish people throughout Europe, alongside Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Italkian (Judeo-Italian), Knaanic (Judeo-Slavic), Yevanic (Judeo-Greek), and Zarphatic (Judeo-French). Of these languages, Yiddish produced the most significant literature and served as an icon of Jewish identity throughout Central and Eastern Europe.

===Yoruba or Lucumi===

The Yoruba language can be found across the globe, on every continent, however enforced migration under colonial slavery resulted in a particular density in the Americas and pressure on Yoruba speakers to adapt or assimilate. In the Caribbean, in particular, Yoruba culture, religion, and language have co-evolved with the needs of the enslaved populations, generating extensive hybridization and surviving into the current era. The Santeria religion draws its roots from Catholic, Yoruba and Native American spiritual traditions, and its liturgical language is Lucumi, a dialect of the original predominantly Nigerian Yoruba.

===Canadian Gaelic===
In the aftermath of the Highland and Lowland Clearances, a great number of Scots emigrated to Canada, proportionately more than the other Anglo New World countries of the United States, Australia, and even New Zealand. They brought with them their language, and while many spoke Scots or English, a great number spoke Gaelic. It was even debated in the early days of Canadian Confederation whether to make Gaelic (inclusive of both the Scottish and Irish varieties) the third official language of Canada, and, if Irish and Scottish are counted together, Gaelic was the most common native tongue amongst the Fathers of Confederation of Canada, more common than French or English, and the first Canadian Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, spoke it as his mother tongue. Canadian Gaelic is considered to be similar to the western dialects of Gaidhlig in Scotland.

===Cocoliche===
Cocoliche is an Italian–Spanish contact language or pidgin that was spoken by Italian immigrants between 1870 and 1970 in Argentina (especially in Greater Buenos Aires) and from there spread to other urban areas nearby, such as La Plata, Rosario and Montevideo, Uruguay. In recent decades it has become more respected and even recorded in music and film. Traces of it may be found in Argentina, Brazil, Albania, Panama, Quebec, Uruguay, Venezuela, San Marcos, Cabo Verde and many other places.

===Talian===

Talian (, ), or Brazilian Venetian, or Vêneto is a Venetian dialect spoken primarily in the Serra Gaúcha region in the northeast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil. It is also spoken in other parts of Rio Grande do Sul, as well as in parts of Espírito Santo and of Santa Catarina. Talian is mainly a Venetian dialect mixed with Italian dialects from the Veneto region as well as Lombardy and other Italian regions, influenced by local Portuguese.
===Lunfardo===
Lunfardo (; from the Italian &quot;lombardo&quot; or inhabitant of Lombardy, &quot;lumbard&quot; in Lombard) is an argot originated and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the lower classes in the Río de la Plata region (encompassing the port cities of Buenos Aires and Montevideo) and from there spread to other urban areas nearby, such as the Greater Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Rosario.

Lunfardo originated from the mixture of languages and dialects produced due to the massive European immigration, mainly Italian and Spanish, which arrived in the ports of the region since the end of the 19th century. It was originally a slang used by criminals and soon by other people of the lower and lower-middle classes. Later, many of its words and phrases were introduced in the vernacular and disseminated in the Spanish of Argentina, and Uruguay. Nevertheless, since the early 20th century, Lunfardo has spread among all social strata and classes by habitual use or because it was common in the lyrics of tango.

Today, the meaning of the term &quot;lunfardo&quot; has been extended to designate any slang or jargon used in Buenos Aires.

===Canadian Ukrainian===
In the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the province of Galicia was considered the poorest in all of Europe, and was considerably over-populated. While the western part, containing Warsaw, was more densely populated and better maintained, the eastern part, overwhelmingly Ukrainian, was considered the most backward part of the Empire and good for little more than as a source of troops for the army. This led to a mass exodus of citizens, along with Ukrainians from the neighbouring region of Bukovina, to Canada, settling primarily in the Western provinces of The Prairies. They brought with them not just their religion – western Ukrainians are predominately Ukrainian Catholic whereas the rest of Ukraine is largely Eastern Orthodox – but also their language. To this day, Canadian Ukrainian is clearly reminiscent of the Western dialects, and has minimal influence from Russian (given that it had never been part of the Russian Empire and was only conquered by the Soviet Union after WWII, long after the Canadian Ukrainian community had been established), but proportionately greater influence from Polish and German, such as loanwords. The Canadian dialect frequently uses English words for technologies or concepts developed since the start of the 20th century, so while vocabulary like &quot;coal&quot; and &quot;shoe&quot; remain the same as their counterparts in Ukraine, newer concepts frequently use English loanwords for items such as &quot;truck&quot; and &quot;cash register.&quot;

<text>Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to vaporize materials, resulting in a cut edge. While typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, it is now used by schools, small businesses, architecture, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the laser beam to the material. A commercial laser for cutting materials uses a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish.

== History ==
In 1965, the first production laser cutting machine was used to drill holes in diamond dies. This machine was made by the Western Electric Engineering Research Center. In 1967, the British pioneered laser-assisted oxygen jet cutting for metals. In the early 1970s, this technology was put into production to cut titanium for aerospace applications. At the same time, CO2 lasers were adapted to cut non-metals, such as textiles, because, at the time, CO2 lasers were not powerful enough to overcome the thermal conductivity of metals.

== Process ==
The laser beam is generally focused using a high-quality lens on the work zone. The quality of the beam has a direct impact on the focused spot size. The narrowest part of the focused beam is generally less than in diameter. Depending upon the material thickness, widths as small as are possible. In order to be able to start cutting from somewhere other than the edge, a pierce is done before every cut. Piercing usually involves a high-power pulsed laser beam which slowly makes a hole in the material, taking around 5–15 seconds for stainless steel, for example.

The parallel rays of coherent light from the laser source often fall in the range between in diameter. This beam is normally focused and intensified by a lens or a mirror to a very small spot of about to create a very intense laser beam. In order to achieve the smoothest possible finish during contour cutting, the direction of the beam polarization must be rotated as it goes around the periphery of a contoured workpiece. For sheet metal cutting, the focal length is usually .

Advantages of laser cutting over mechanical cutting include easier work holding and reduced contamination of workpiece (since there is no cutting edge which can become contaminated by the material or contaminate the material). Precision may be better since the laser beam does not wear during the process. There is also a reduced chance of warping the material that is being cut, as laser systems have a small heat-affected zone. Some materials are also very difficult or impossible to cut by more traditional means.

Laser cutting for metals has the advantage over plasma cutting of being more precise and using less energy when cutting sheet metal; however, most industrial lasers cannot cut through the greater metal thickness that plasma can. Newer laser machines operating at higher power (6000 watts, as contrasted with early laser cutting machines&#x27; 1500-watt ratings) are approaching plasma machines in their ability to cut through thick materials, but the capital cost of such machines is much higher than that of plasma cutting machines capable of cutting thick materials like steel plate.

== Types ==

There are three main types of lasers used in laser cutting. The laser is suited for cutting, boring, and engraving. The neodymium (Nd) and neodymium yttrium-aluminium-garnet () lasers are identical in style and differ only in the application. Nd is used for boring and where high energy but low repetition are required. The Nd:YAG laser is used where very high power is needed and for boring and engraving. Both and Nd/Nd:YAG lasers can be used for welding.

 lasers are commonly &quot;pumped&quot; by passing a current through the gas mix (DC-excited) or using radio frequency energy (RF-excited). The RF method is newer and has become more popular. Since DC designs require electrodes inside the cavity, they can encounter electrode erosion and plating of electrode material on glassware and optics. Since RF resonators have external electrodes they are not prone to those problems.
 lasers are used for the industrial cutting of many materials including titanium, stainless steel, mild steel, aluminium, plastic, wood, engineered wood, wax, fabrics, and paper. YAG lasers are primarily used for cutting and scribing metals and ceramics.

In addition to the power source, the type of gas flow can affect performance as well. Common variants of lasers include fast axial flow, slow axial flow, transverse flow, and slab. In a fast axial flow resonator, the mixture of carbon dioxide, helium, and nitrogen is circulated at high velocity by a turbine or blower. Transverse flow lasers circulate the gas mix at a lower velocity, requiring a simpler blower. Slab or diffusion-cooled resonators have a static gas field that requires no pressurization or glassware, leading to savings on replacement turbines and glassware.

The laser generator and external optics (including the focus lens) require cooling. Depending on system size and configuration, waste heat may be transferred by a coolant or directly to air. Water is a commonly used coolant, usually circulated through a chiller or heat transfer system.

A &quot;laser microjet&quot; is a water-jet-guided laser in which a pulsed laser beam is coupled into a low-pressure water jet. This is used to perform laser cutting functions while using the water jet to guide the laser beam, much like an optical fiber, through total internal reflection. The advantages of this are that the water also removes debris and cools the material. Additional advantages over traditional &quot;dry&quot; laser cutting are high dicing speeds, parallel , and omnidirectional cutting.

Fiber lasers are a type of solid-state laser that is rapidly growing within the metal cutting industry. Unlike CO2, Fiber technology utilizes a solid gain medium, as opposed to a gas or liquid. The “seed laser” produces the laser beam and is then amplified within a glass fiber. With a wavelength of only 1064 nanometers fiber lasers produce an extremely small spot size (up to 100 times smaller compared to the CO2) making it ideal for cutting reflective metal material. This is one of the main advantages of Fiber compared to CO2.

Fibre laser cutter benefits include:

* Rapid processing times.
* Reduced energy consumption &amp; bills – due to greater efficiency.
* Greater reliability and performance - no optics to adjust or align and no lamps to replace.
* Minimal maintenance.
* The ability to process highly reflective materials such as copper and brass.
* Higher productivity - lower operational costs offer a greater return on your investment.

== Methods ==

There are many different methods of cutting using lasers, with different types used to cut different materials. Some of the methods are vaporization, melt and blow, melt blow and burn, thermal stress cracking, scribing, cold cutting, and burning stabilized laser cutting.

===Vaporization cutting===
In vaporization cutting, the focused beam heats the surface of the material to a flashpoint and generates a keyhole. The keyhole leads to a sudden increase in absorptivity quickly deepening the hole. As the hole deepens and the material boils, vapor generated erodes the molten walls blowing ejection out and further enlarging the hole. Nonmelting materials such as wood, carbon, and thermoset plastics are usually cut by this method.

===Melt and blow===
Melt and blow or fusion cutting uses high-pressure gas to blow molten material from the cutting area, greatly decreasing the power requirement. First, the material is heated to melting point then a gas jet blows the molten material out of the kerf avoiding the need to raise the temperature of the material any further. Materials cut with this process are usually metals.

===Thermal stress cracking===
Brittle materials are particularly sensitive to thermal fracture, a feature exploited in thermal stress cracking. A beam is focused on the surface causing localized heating and thermal expansion. This results in a crack that can then be guided by moving the beam. The crack can be moved in order of m/s. It is usually used in the cutting of glass.

===Stealth dicing of silicon wafers===

The separation of microelectronic chips as prepared in semiconductor device fabrication from silicon wafers may be performed by the so-called stealth dicing process, which operates with a pulsed , the wavelength of which (1064 nm) is well adapted to the electronic band gap of silicon (1.11 eV or 1117 nm).

===Reactive cutting===
Reactive cutting is also called &quot;burning stabilized laser gas cutting&quot; and &quot;flame cutting&quot;. Reactive cutting is like oxygen torch cutting but with a laser beam as the ignition source. Mostly used for cutting carbon steel in thicknesses over 1 mm. This process can be used to cut very thick steel plates with relatively little laser power.

== Tolerances and surface finish ==
Laser cutters have a positioning accuracy of 10 micrometers and repeatability of 5 micrometers.

Standard roughness Rz increases with the sheet thickness, but decreases with laser power and cutting speed. When cutting low carbon steel with laser power of 800 W, standard roughness Rz is 10 μm for sheet thickness of 1 mm, 20 μm for 3 mm, and 25 μm for 6 mm.

formula_1

Where: formula_2 steel sheet thickness in mm; formula_3 laser power in kW (some new laser cutters have laser power of 4 kW); formula_4 cutting speed in meters per minute.

This process is capable of holding quite close tolerances, often to within 0.001 inch (0.025 mm). Part geometry and the mechanical soundness of the machine have much to do with tolerance capabilities. The typical surface finish resulting from laser beam cutting may range from 125 to 250 micro-inches (0.003 mm to 0.006 mm).

== Machine configurations ==

There are generally three different configurations of industrial laser cutting machines: moving material, hybrid, and flying optics systems. These refer to the way that the laser beam is moved over the material to be cut or processed. For all of these, the axes of motion are typically designated X and Y axis. If the cutting head may be controlled, it is designated as the Z-axis.

Moving material lasers have a stationary cutting head and move the material under it. This method provides a constant distance from the laser generator to the workpiece and a single point from which to remove cutting effluent. It requires fewer optics but requires moving the workpiece. This style of machine tends to have the fewest beam delivery optics but also tends to be the slowest.

Hybrid lasers provide a table that moves in one axis (usually the X-axis) and moves the head along the shorter (Y) axis. This results in a more constant beam delivery path length than a flying optic machine and may permit a simpler beam delivery system. This can result in reduced power loss in the delivery system and more capacity per watt than flying optics machines.

Flying optics lasers feature a stationary table and a cutting head (with a laser beam) that moves over the workpiece in both of the horizontal dimensions. Flying optics cutters keep the workpiece stationary during processing and often do not require material clamping. The moving mass is constant, so dynamics are not affected by varying the size of the workpiece. Flying optics machines are the fastest type, which is advantageous when cutting thinner workpieces.

Flying optic machines must use some method to take into account the changing beam length from the near field (close to the resonator) cutting to the far field (far away from the resonator) cutting. Common methods for controlling this include collimation, adaptive optics, or the use of a constant beam length axis.

Five and six-axis machines also permit cutting formed workpieces. In addition, there are various methods of orienting the laser beam to a shaped workpiece, maintaining a proper focus distance and nozzle standoff.

=== Pulsing ===
Pulsed lasers which provide a high-power burst of energy for a short period are very effective in some laser cutting processes, particularly for piercing, or when very small holes or very low cutting speeds are required, since if a constant laser beam were used, the heat could reach the point of melting the whole piece being cut.

Most industrial lasers have the ability to pulse or cut CW (continuous wave) under NC (numerical control) program control.

Double pulse lasers use a series of pulse pairs to improve material removal rate and hole quality. Essentially, the first pulse removes material from the surface and the second prevents the ejecta from adhering to the side of the hole or cut.

== Power consumption ==
The main disadvantage of laser cutting is the high power consumption. Industrial laser efficiency may range from 5% to 45%. The power consumption and efficiency of any particular laser will vary depending on output power and operating parameters. This will depend on the type of laser and how well the laser is matched to the work at hand. The amount of laser cutting power required, known as &quot;heat input&quot;, for a particular job depends on the material type, thickness, process (reactive/inert) used, and desired cutting rate.

== Production and cutting rates ==
The maximum cutting rate (production rate) is limited by a number of factors including laser power, material thickness, process type (reactive or inert), and material properties. Common industrial systems (≥1 kW) will cut carbon steel metal from in thickness. For many purposes, a laser can be up to thirty times faster than standard sawing.

<text>Jerry Ross (born Jerold Rosenberg; March 9, 1926 – November 11, 1955) was an American lyricist and composer whose works with Richard Adler for the musical theater include &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, winners of Tony Awards in 1955 and 1956, respectively, in both the &quot;Best Musical&quot; and &quot;Best Composer and Lyricist&quot; categories.

==Biography==
Jerold Rosenberg was born in the Bronx, New York City, to a Russian-Jewish household, to immigrant parents, Lena and Jacob Rosenberg. Growing up, he was a professional singer and actor in the Yiddish theater.

Following high school, he studied at New York University under Rudolph Schramm. Introductions to singer Eddie Fisher and others brought him into contact with music publishers at the Brill Building, the center of songwriting activity in New York. (Fisher later had a hit with Ross’ &quot;The Newspaper Song&quot;.)

Ross met Richard Adler in 1950, and as a duo they became protégés of the great composer, lyricist, and publisher Frank Loesser. Their song &quot;Rags to Riches&quot; was recorded by Tony Bennett and reached number 1 on the charts in 1953. They also had a jazz novelty hit with Anita O&#x27;Day&#x27;s recording of &quot;No Soap, No Hope Blues&quot;.

Adler and Ross began their career in the Broadway theater with &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, a revue for which they provided most of the songs (resulting in recordings of &quot;Acorn in the Meadow&quot; by Harry Belafonte and &quot;Fini&quot; by Polly Bergen). The revue opened in 1953 and ran for 229 performances.

Adler and Ross&#x27;s second effort, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, opened on Broadway in May 1954. It was a popular as well as critical success, running for 1063 performances. The show won the 1955 Tony Award for Best Musical as well as the Donaldson Award and the Variety Drama Critics Award. Two songs from the show, &quot;Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway&quot; (for Archie Bleyer) and &quot;Hey There&quot; (for Rosemary Clooney), topped the Hit Parade. Other notable songs were &quot;Steam Heat&quot; (choreographed on stage by Bob Fosse), &quot;Small Talk&quot;, and &quot;Seven and a Half Cents&quot;.

Their next musical, &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, opened on Broadway in 1955, starring Gwen Verdon. The musical ran for 1,019 performances. Adler and Ross, as composer and lyricist, shared in the 1956 Tony Award for Best Musical. Pop hits from the show were &quot;Heart&quot;, recorded by Eddie Fisher, and &quot;Whatever Lola Wants&quot; for Sarah Vaughan.&quot;

==Death==
Jerry Ross died on November 11, 1955, at the age of 29, from complications related to the lung disease bronchiectasis. In his short life, Ross was extremely productive; he wrote, alone or in collaboration, more than 250 songs in addition to his theatre work.

Ross was entered posthumously into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1982, his widow, Judy, and daughter, Janie, accepting on his behalf.

<doc id="531918" wikidata="Q1134349" url="?curid=531918" title="Ghirardelli Chocolate Company">
<text>The Ghirardelli Chocolate Company (simply known as Ghirardelli) is an American confectioner, wholly owned by Swiss confectioner Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. The company was founded by and is named after Italian chocolatier Domenico Ghirardelli, who, after working in South America, moved to California. The Ghirardelli Chocolate Company was incorporated in 1852, and is the third-oldest chocolate company in the US, after Baker&#x27;s Chocolate and Whitman&#x27;s.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
In 1817, Domenico Ghirardelli was born in Rapallo, Italy, to an &quot;exotic foods importer&quot; and his wife. Domenico received his first education in the chocolate trade when he was apprenticed to a local candymaker as a child. By the time he was 20, Ghirardelli had sailed to Uruguay with his wife to work in a chocolate and coffee business. A year later, Ghirardelli moved to Lima, Peru, and opened a confectionery store. In 1847, nine years later, James Lick (Ghirardelli&#x27;s neighbor) moved to San Francisco, California, with of Ghirardelli&#x27;s chocolate. Ghirardelli remained and continued to operate his store in Peru.

=== The move to California ===
In 1849, Ghirardelli received news of the gold strike at Sutter&#x27;s Mill and sailed to California. After doing some prospecting, Ghirardelli opened a general store in Stockton, California, offering supplies and confections to fellow miners. Ghirardelli&#x27;s tent-based store was one of the first shops set up in the area.

Several months later, Ghirardelli opened a second store on the corner of Broadway and Battery in San Francisco, which became, in 1850, his first establishment in that city.

Ghirardelli had a general store in Hornitos, California, between 1856 and 1859, during a gold rush, where he perfected his chocolate recipes. The remains of the store can still be seen in town.

===Early history in San Francisco===
A fire on May 3, 1851, destroyed Ghirardelli&#x27;s San Francisco business, and a few days later, his Stockton store also burned down. However, in September of the same year, Ghirardelli used his remaining assets to open the Cairo Coffee House in San Francisco. This business venture proved unsuccessful, and Ghirardelli opened a new store, named Ghirardely &amp; Girard,&lt;ref name=&quot;ghirardelli/history&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; on the corner of Washington and Kearny Streets in San Francisco. Soon afterward, Ghirardelli was making enough money to send for his family, who were still living in Peru. He changed the company&#x27;s name to D. Ghirardelli &amp; Co. and, in 1852, imported of cocoa beans. The company was incorporated in 1852 and has been in continuous operation since.

The next year, in 1853, the business relocated to the corner of Jackson and Mason Streets. By 1855, a larger manufacturing facility was needed, and so the factory was moved to the corner of Greenwich and Powell Streets, while the office remained at the previous location. During this time, the company sold liquor, but dropped their line of alcoholic products sometime after 1871. By 1866, the company was importing of cocoa seeds a year. By that time, the company not only sold chocolate, but also coffee and spices to the United States, China, Japan, and Mexico. In 1885, the company imported of cocoa seeds.

In 1892, Ghirardelli retired as head of the company and was replaced by his three sons. Two years later, on January 17, 1894, Ghirardelli died at age 77 in Rapallo, Italy.

===1900-present===

By 1900, Ghirardelli&#x27;s company was selling only chocolate and mustard, having sold its coffee and spices businesses. Further expansion over the years into different buildings allowed the company to expand into new markets and grow financially. In 1965, San Francisco declared Ghirardelli Square (where many of the Ghirardelli buildings were constructed) an official city landmark. Two years later, production facilities moved to San Leandro, California ().
Since the 1960s Ghirardelli has also moved to focus on a restaurant division by selling ice cream sundaes, complete with their famous hot fudge chocolate sauce. In one of their earliest menus from the 1960s they featured five &quot;Nob Hill Sundaes&quot; all named after different landmarks, historical aspects, or local figures from San Francisco (Twin Peaks, Golden Gate Banana Split, Strike it Rich, The Rock, and the Emperor Norton). As of 2024, they feature 11 different sundaes (World Famous Hot Fudge, Ocean Beach, Chocolate Lovers, Gold Rush, Mint Bliss, Strawberry Passion, Non-Dairy Hot Fudge, Cookie Crumble, Lands End, Golden Gate Banana Split, and Treasure Island).

In 1963, Ghirardelli Chocolate Company was bought by the Golden Grain Macaroni Company, maker of Rice-A-Roni. Later, in 1986, Quaker Oats bought Golden Grain, and thus Ghirardelli. In 1992, Quaker Oats sold the Ghirardelli Chocolate division to a private investment group. John J. Anton, from that group, became the president and CEO of the newly independent Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. In 1998, Lindt and Sprüngli, from Switzerland, acquired Ghirardelli Chocolate Company as a wholly owned subsidiary of its holding company.

In 2015, an independent laboratory tested 127 chocolate products for lead and cadmium, and found that 96 of them contained lead and/or cadmium above the safety threshold defined by California&#x27;s Proposition 65. Based on these results, As You Sow filed notices with over 20 companies, including Ghirardelli and Trader Joe&#x27;s, for failing to provide the legally required warning to consumers that their chocolate products contain cadmium, lead, or both. The suit was settled in 2018.

== Production ==

According to their own website, Ghirardelli is one of the few chocolate companies in the United States to control every aspect of its chocolate manufacturing process, rejecting up to 40% of the cocoa seeds shipped in order to select what the company calls the &quot;highest quality&quot; seeds. The company then roasts the cocoa seeds in-house by removing the outer shell on the seed and roasting the inside of the seed, or the nibs. The chocolate is then ground and refined until the particles are in size.

== Products ==

Ghirardelli produces several flavors of chocolate. The chocolate is sold in bar form or in miniature squares.

Ghirardelli also sells food service items, like chocolate beverages and flavored sauces, to other retailers.

With miles of coastline and the stunning waters of Óbidos lagoon, the Silver Coast is heaven for watersport enthusiasts. Surfing is the major activity but it is not the only one. With its mild climate and good winds, there is something here for almost every type of watersport.

The inland waters of Óbidos lagoon provide a sheltered location for sailors of all abilities. There is a sailing centre, Escola de Vela da Lagoa, on the Foz do Arelho side which caters for experienced sailors by providing a range of equipment for rental, and beginners through its sailing schools.
Here it is possible to learn a watersport such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, sailing (including catamarans), canoeing, wakeboarding and water skiing, all in a beautiful landscape where forests roll down to the water&#x27;s edge and the Atlantic pounds on beaches at the entrance to the lagoon. For those who are expert and daring enough to venture out into the waves, the lagoon offers an ideal launching place and a safe harbour to return to.

<text>The 1996 Washington gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1996. Though eligible for a second term, incumbent governor Mike Lowry chose not to run for reelection following a series of personal and public scandals, including allegations of sexual harassment. This gubernatorial race was especially significant in that it resulted in the first Asian American governor in the mainland United States (after George Ariyoshi of island state Hawaii), Democrat Gary Locke.

** Likened her policy positions to Reaganite conservatism, espousing a philosophy of small government, rights and freedoms, together with moral values.

=== Campaign Controversies ===
* Gary Locke&#x27;s race drew many donors from the Asian American Community, including local Buddhist temples. He also raised significant funds from national donors, in California and New York.
* Ellen Craswell integrated evangelical prayer networks with her fundraising and mobilization network, reaching more that 1000 small donors in October, where Locke received large contributions from business groups and Seattle elites.
* Craswell opposed expanding school funding: suggested cutting English as Second Language programs; delegating curriculum control to local school boards; and eliminating the superintendent of public instruction.
* An independent Political action committee made false claims that two sitting senators endorsed Locke in a mailer. They later recanted.
* The WA State GOP ran television ads, stating Locke&#x27;s support for a Harm reduction program including sex education, counseling and condom distribution provided material support for prostitution.

=== Subsequent controversies ===
The Washington State Public Disclosure Commission opened an investigation in 1997 relating to campaign contributions received from the Chinese Americans and foreign nationals. In example, the Ling Chen Zhe Buddhist temple, where a $5000 cash donation was accepted, returned and five $1000 donations were given in its place. Together with official campaign events held at the Harmony Palace restaurant, co-owned by a leader of the Chinese gang Ghost Shadows. In total, six fundraising events for the Locke campaign were organized by John Huang, who donated $750 personally, with similar occurrences at each one.

This investigation was subsequently picked up (as part of a probe into the 1996 campaign finance scandal) by the IRS, who requested records extending to 1990, the time of Locke&#x27;s campaign for King County executive. Locke testified before Congress in 2006 and denied knowingly accepting campaign contributions from Chinese foreign agents. In 2015, the Locke gubernatorial campaign plead guilty to breaking three campaign fundraising laws relating to the limits for individual contribution, timely reporting of contributions, and failure to deposit cash contributions.

Ellen Craswell battled cancer immediately following the election, retired in 2005, and died in 2008.

<text>The Fender Stratocaster, colloquially known as the Strat, is a model of double-cutaway electric guitar designed between 1952 and 1954 by Leo Fender, Bill Carson, George Fullerton, and Freddie Tavares. The Fender Musical Instruments Corporation has continuously manufactured the Stratocaster since 1954.

The guitar&#x27;s distinctive body shape was revolutionary when introduced in the mid-1950s, and the first time a mass-market electric guitar did not resemble earlier acoustic models. The double cutaway, elongated horns, and heavily contoured back were all designed for better balance and comfort to play while standing up and slung off the shoulder with a strap. The three-pickup design was a step up from earlier one- and two-pickup guitars, and a responsive and simplified vibrato arm integrated into the bridge plate, which marked a significant design improvement over other vibrato systems, such as those manufactured by Bigsby. However, Stratocasters without the vibrato system (&quot;hardtails&quot;) were added to the portfolio in March 1955. The modular nature of the guitar, with its easily removable components, left players and luthiers to perform numerous modifications to their own guitars, changing out pickups or necks to fit the needs of the player. All of these design elements were popularized and later became industry standards due to the success of the Stratocaster.

Many prominent rock musicians have been associated with the Stratocaster for use in studio recording and live performances, most notably Eric Clapton, Buddy Holly, David Gilmour, Mark Knopfler, Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Johnson, John Frusciante, Yngwie Malmsteen and Jeff Beck.

The Fender Stratocaster is one of the most iconic electric guitar models of all time, and along with the Gibson Les Paul, Gibson SG, and Fender Telecaster, it is one of the most-often emulated electric guitar shapes, It is a patented design, and &quot;Stratocaster&quot; and &quot;Strat&quot; are Fender trademarks. Therefore, imitations by other manufacturers must be shaped slightly differently, and are sometimes called S-Type or ST-type guitars, while the term &quot;Superstrat&quot; typically refers to third-party Stratocaster look-alikes from the 1980s onwards with innovative features such as new types of bridges or pick-up configurations. Some of these features were subsequently also offered on Fender Stratocaster models or those made under the Fender owned brand, Squier, and the Superstrat term is sometimes also applied to these Fender and Squier models.

==Overall design==
The archetypal Stratocaster is a solid-body electric guitar with a contoured asymmetric double-cutaway body with an extended upper horn; the body is usually made from alder or ash. The neck is usually made from maple and attached to the body with screws (often referred to as &quot;bolts&quot;) and has a distinctive headstock with six tuning pegs mounted inline along a single side; the fingerboard may be maple or another wood, e.g., rosewood, and has at least twenty-one frets. 
The Stratocaster&#x27;s body is front-routed for electronics, which are mounted in a plastic pickguard. Most Stratocasters have three single-coil pickups, a pickup selector switch, one volume control and two tone controls. Bridges generally come in two designs: the more common pivoting &quot;tremolo&quot; bridges, and the less common &quot;hardtail&quot; fixed bridge. Both types of bridge have six individually adjustable saddles whose height and intonation can be set independently. Early models of the stratocaster came with a removable metal cover plate that fit over the bridge. The plate tended to get in the way of important playing techniques such as palm muting, so many players removed it. By the late 1970s, Fender stopped shipping guitars with the bridge cover plate, though some more modern reissue and custom shop models still have them. The innovative tremolo system is balanced by springs mounted in a rear cavity. The output jack is mounted in a recess in the front of the guitar body. Many different colors have been available. The Stratocaster&#x27;s scale length is .

There have been some minor changes to the design over the years and models with features that differ from the archetypical design. However, the essential character of the design has remained constant while Fender released countless variations of the Stratocaster over the years that differed in pickup configuration, types of wood, tuning pegs and modifications to the electronics.

==History==
===1954–1984===
The Stratocaster was the first Fender guitar to feature three pickups and a spring tension vibrato system, as well as being the first Fender with a contoured body. The Stratocaster&#x27;s sleek, contoured body shape (officially referred to by Fender as the &quot;Original Contour Body&quot;) differed from the flat, squared edge design of the Telecaster. The Stratocaster&#x27;s double cutaways allowed players easier access to higher positions on the neck.

The first model offered for sale was the 1954 Fender Stratocaster. The design featured a solid, deeply contoured ash body, a 21-fret one-piece maple neck with black dot inlays, and Kluson SafeTi String post tuning machines. The color was originally a two-color, dark brown-to-golden yellow sunburst pattern, although custom color guitars were produced (An example is Eldon Shamblin&#x27;s gold Stratocaster, dated June 1954).

In 1956, Fender began using alder for sunburst and most custom-color Stratocaster bodies. Ash needed grain filler and sanding blocks for contour sanding, though it was still used on translucent blonde instruments.

In 1957, the neck shape took a more &quot;V-shaped&quot; feel with deeper body carves on the guitar a noted feature.

In 1959, Fender introduced a thick Brazilian rosewood fretboard to the Stratocaster, now colloquially referred to as a &quot;slab-board&quot;. This thicker board lasted until 1962, when the fretboard was made with a thinner &#x27;veneer&#x27; of Brazilian Rosewood. Nearly all of the 1960s models of the Stratocaster had a rosewood fretboard, and maple fretboards would not be re-introduced in large numbers until 1970.

In 1960, the available custom colors were standardized with a paint chip chart, many of which were Duco automobile lacquer colors from DuPont available at an additional 5% cost. Inter-departmental DuPont support research provided a flexible basecoat for their wood applications.

A single-ply, eight-screw hole white pickguard (changed to an 11-hole three-ply in late 1959) held all electronic components except the recessed jack plate, facilitating assembly.

The 1963 Fender Stratocaster shows a change in design from the 1950s models including Clay Dot inlays, a 3 tone sunburst finish on an Alder body and Kluson tuners.

To summarize, the specific features in the evolution of the Fender Stratocaster between 1954 and 1979 included:

;Neck/fretboard
* 1954–1959, one piece maple necks (including fretboard);
* 1959–1962, thick Brazilian rosewood (&quot;Dalbergia nigra&quot;) fretboard known as a &quot;slab-board&quot;;
* 1962–1966, thin Brazilian rosewood fretboard known as a &quot;veneer-board&quot;;
* 1966–1969, Indian rosewood or optional separate laminated &quot;maple cap&quot; fretboards;
;Pickup selector
* 1954–1977, three way pickup selector switch;
* 1977–present, five way pickup selector switch.
;Tuners
* 1954–1967, Kluson tuners;
* 1967–1982, Fender &quot;F&quot; Tuners
;Back plate
* 1954–1971, 4 bolt back plate at neck joint;
* 1971–1981, 3 bolt back plate with MicroTilt neck tilt or angle adjuster and &quot;Bullet&quot; truss rod nut;
;Logo and headstock
* 1954–1964, Spaghetti logo on the headstock;
* 1964–1967, gold &quot;transition&quot; logo on the headstock with small writing of the word &quot;Stratocaster&quot;;
* 1965–1981, headstock enlarged on the right hand side, now matching the Jazzmaster and Jaguar
* 1968–1982, black CBS logo with larger printed &quot;STRATOCASTER&quot; on the headstock;

Leo Fender made very few alterations to the basic design of the Fender Stratocaster (and the Telecaster for that matter) up until 1965 when the company was sold to CBS Instruments. For example, the bridge cover on the Fender Stratocaster was often taken off by players and either disposed or kept in the case. Despite full knowledge of this, Leo Fender always provided the new Fender guitars with a bridge cover to prevent corrosion on the bridge parts.
After 1965, the Fender company, under the control of CBS Instruments, saw a drop in sales of the Fender Stratocaster to customers. The Fender Jazzmaster had been promoted as the flagship guitar in the Fender line. As such, the resurgence of the Fender Stratocaster is credited to the arrival of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s. His remarkable playing style and musical prowess led to a dramatic increase in sales and thrust the Stratocaster into musical history as the premier electric guitar. As they followed Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s popularity on TV, CBS asked for the word Stratocaster on the headstock be made larger so that people could read the model name easily.

Between the years 1954 and 1979, nearly a quarter of the Fender Stratocasters manufactured were made in a single year, in 1979. The increased 1970s production levels saw a gradual departure from the high quality instruments of the 1960s and the introduction of Japanese manufacturers into the market.

The Stratocaster features three single coil pickups, with the output originally selected by a 3-way switch. Guitarists soon discovered that by positioning the switch in between the first and second position, both the bridge and middle pickups could be selected, and similarly, the middle and neck pickups could be selected between the 2nd and 3rd position. When two pickups are selected simultaneously, they are wired in parallel which leads to a slight drop in output as slightly more current is allowed to pass to the ground. In newer guitars, since the middle pickup is almost always wired in reverse (and with its magnets having opposite polarity, this combination also being referred to as &quot;RWRP&quot;), the intermediate positions create a spaced humbucking pair, which significantly reduces 50/60 cycle hum. Fender introduced a five-way selector in 1977, making such pickup combinations more stable.

The &quot;quacky&quot; or &quot;doinky&quot; tone of the bridge and middle pickups in parallel, popularized by players such as Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, David Gilmour, Rory Gallagher, Mark Knopfler, Bob Dylan, Eric Johnson, Nile Rodgers, George Harrison, Scott Thurston, Ronnie Wood, John Mayer, Ed King, Robert Cray, can be obtained by using the pickup selector in position 2; similarly the middle and neck pickups in parallel can be obtained in position 4.

This setting&#x27;s characteristic tone is not caused by any electronic phenomenon—early Stratocasters used identical pickups for all positions. This &quot;in between&quot; tone is caused by phase cancellation due to the physical position of the pickups along the vibrating string. The neck and middle pickups are each wired to a tone control that incorporates a single, shared tone capacitor, whereas the bridge pickup, which is slanted towards the high strings for a more trebly sound, has no tone control for maximum brightness.

On many modern Stratocasters, the first tone control affects the neck pickup; the second tone control affects the middle and bridge pickups; on some Artist Series models (e.g. Buddy Guy signature guitar), the first tone control is a presence circuit that cuts or boosts treble and bass frequencies, affecting all the pickups; the second tone control is an active midrange booster that boosts the midrange frequencies up to 25 dB (12 dB on certain models) to produce a fatter humbucker-like sound.

Dick Dale was a prominent Stratocaster player who also collaborated with Leo Fender in developing the Fender Showman amplifier. In the early 1960s, the instrument was also championed by Hank Marvin, guitarist for the Shadows, a band that originally backed Cliff Richard and then produced instrumentals of its own. In December 1964, George Harrison and John Lennon acquired Stratocasters and used them for &quot;Help!&quot;, and onwards. The double unison guitar solo on &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, was played by Harrison and Lennon on their new Stratocasters.

After the introduction of the Fender Stratocaster Ultra series in 1989, ebony was officially selected as a fretboard material on some models (although several Elite Series Stratocasters manufactured in 1983/84 such as the Gold and Walnut were available with a stained ebony fretboard).

===1985–present===

During the CBS era, particularly the 1970s, the perceived quality of Fender instruments fell. During this time, vintage instruments from the pre-CBS era became popular.

When the Fender company was bought from CBS by a group of investors and employees headed by Bill Schultz in 1985, manufacturing resumed its former high quality, and Fender was able to regain market share and brand reputation. Dan Smith, with the help of John Page, proceeded to work on a reissue of the most popular guitars of Leo Fender&#x27;s era. They decided to manufacture two Vintage reissue Stratocaster models, the one-piece maple neck 1957 and a rosewood-fretboard 1962 along with the maple-neck 1952 Telecaster, the maple-neck 1957 and rosewood-fretboard 1962 Precision Basses, as well as the rosewood-fretboard &quot;stacked knob&quot; 1962 Jazz Bass. These first few years (1982–1984) of reissues, known as American Vintage Reissues, are now high-priced collector&#x27;s items and considered as some of the finest to ever leave Fender&#x27;s Fullerton plant, which closed its doors in late 1984.

In 1985, Fender&#x27;s US production of the Vintage reissues resumed into a new factory at Corona, California, located about away from Fullerton. Some early reissues from 1986 were crafted with leftover parts from the Fullerton factory. Fender released their first Stratocaster signature guitar for Eric Clapton in 1988.
A popular Fender Reissue Stratocaster was the &#x27;57 American Vintage Reissue. The company regarded 1957 as a benchmark year for the Strat. The original specifications were used, with three 57/62 pickups, aged pickup covers and knobs, a tinted 7.25&quot; radius, 21 fret maple neck, an ashtray bridge cover, and three position switch (with five-position switch kit included). The colors included white blonde, two-color sunburst, black, ocean turquoise, surf green, and ice blue metallic. The &#x27;57 Vintage Reissue Stratocaster was discontinued in 2012.

As well as the vintage reissues, Fender launched an updated model in 1987: the American Standard Stratocaster. This was tailored to the demands of modern players, notably having a flatter fingerboard, a thinner neck profile and an improved tremolo system. This model line has been continuously improved and remained in production until late 2016. The model line received upgrades in 2000, when it was renamed as the American Series Stratocaster, and again in 2008, when the American Standard name was restored. In 2017, the American Standard Stratocaster was replaced by the American Professional Stratocaster, with narrow frets, a fatter &#x27;deep C&#x27; neck profile and V-Mod pickups. Various other modern American-made Stratocasters have been produced. As of 2019, these include the more affordable American Performer Stratocaster (successor to the Highway One and American Special Stratocasters) and the more expensive American Ultra Stratocaster (successor to the American Elite Stratocaster).

Fender has also manufactured guitars in East Asia, notably Japan, and in Mexico, where the affordable Player (successor to Standard) series guitars are built. In 2021, Fender released the Player Plus series featuring noiseless pickups, locking tuners, and a 12&quot; radius, to be available alongside the basic Player model.

=== Fender Strat Plus Series ===
Fender has produced various &#x27;deluxe&#x27; modern American Stratocasters with special features.

The Strat Plus was produced from 1987 to 1999 and was equipped with Lace Sensor pickups, a roller nut, locking tuners, a TBX tone control and a Hipshot tremsetter. The Strat Plus Deluxe was introduced in 1989 with pickup and tremolo variations. The Strat Ultra was introduced in 1990, again with pickup variations, and also with an ebony fingerboard.

=== Fender Custom Classic Series ===
The Fender Custom Shop produced an entry level, team built Stratocaster that was discontinued in 2008. The Custom Classic Strat was intended to be a combination of the best aspects of vintage and modern Strats. The guitar boasted 3 Modern Classic pickups along with a Custom Classic 2-point tremolo with pop-in tremolo bar. The &quot;C&quot; Shaped neck was maple with either maple or rosewood finger board and 22 jumbo frets. The colors available were three-color sunburst, daphne blue, black, bing cherry transparent, cobalt blue transparent, and honey blonde.

==Vibrato system==
Original Stratocasters were manufactured with five vibrato springs (three in late 1953 prototypes) attached to a milled inertia block and anchored to the back of the body. The novel mechanism pivots on a fulcrum design with a six screw bridge plate, allowing the whole set-up to &quot;float&quot; while transferring the strings&#x27; energy directly into the body. Though advertised as &quot;Tremolo&quot; (a change in volume amplitude), vibrato is the correct term for pitch variation. In the floating position, players can move the bridge-mounted vibrato tremolo arm up or down to modulate the pitch of the notes being played. Hank Marvin, Jeff Beck and Ike Turner have used the Stratocaster&#x27;s floating vibrato extensively in their playing.

As string gauges have changed, players have experimented with the number of springs (often four though Hendrix used five). As the average gauge has decreased over the years, modern Stratocasters are equipped with three springs as a stock option in order to counteract the reduced string tension. While the floating bridge has unique advantages for wavering pitch upwards (like Jeff Beck), the functionality of the &quot;floating&quot; has been widely accepted, yet disputed by some musicians. Leo Fender insisted it leave the factory floating (raised up in the back) while designer Freddie Tavares preferred it tightened flush for full bridge plate/body contact resonance. As the bridge floats, the instrument has a tendency to go out of tune during double-stop string bends. Many Stratocaster players opt to tighten the springs (or even increase the number of springs used) so that the bridge is firmly anchored against the guitar body: in this configuration, the vibrato arm can still be used to slacken the strings and therefore lower the pitch, but it cannot be used to raise the pitch (a configuration sometimes referred to as &quot;dive-only&quot;).
Some players, such as Ronnie Wood, feel that the floating bridge has an excessive propensity to detune guitars. These guitarists inhibit the bridge&#x27;s movement with a chunk of wood wedged between the bridge block and the inside cutout of the tremolo cavity, and by increasing the tension on the tremolo springs; these procedures lock the bridge in a fixed position. Some Stratocasters have a fixed bridge in place of the vibrato assembly; these are colloquially called &quot;hard-tails&quot;. There is considerable debate about the effects on tone and sustain of the material used in the vibrato system&#x27;s &#x27;inertia bar&#x27; and many aftermarket versions are available.

<text>LensCrafters is an international retailer of prescription eyewear and prescription sunglasses. Its stores usually host independent optometrists on-site or in an adjacent store. The company has its corporate headquarters in Mason, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati in the US.

LensCrafters has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Luxottica (which has since merged with Essilor to form EssilorLuxottica), the largest eyewear company in the world, since 1995. At the end of 2018, Luxottica operated 1,158 LensCrafters stores, of which 1,050 are located in North America and 108 are located in China, Hong Kong and India.

== History ==
LensCrafters was founded in March 1983 by E. Dean Butler, who had been a manager with Procter &amp; Gamble. Butler first developed the idea for a &quot;while you wait&quot; eyeglass retailer after helping a Procter &amp; Gamble colleague produce television commercials for a family optical business in the late 1970s.

LensCrafters achieved sales of $2 million in its first year of operation before Butler sold the company to the United States Shoe Corporation in 1984. Butler remained as LensCrafters&#x27; CEO until 1988.

LensCrafters had just three locations when U.S. Shoe purchased it; by 1989, there were 350 locations, and LensCrafters was generating 40% of U.S. Shoe&#x27;s operating income.

In 1992, LensCrafters surpassed Pearle Vision to become the largest chain of eyeglass retailers in the United States, with roughly $660 million in annual revenue.

In 1995, Luxottica launched a hostile takeover attempt of United States Shoe CorporationU.S. Shoe, with the goal of acquiring LensCrafters. Luxottica announced in April 1995, that it had reached an agreement to purchase U.S. Shoe for $1.4 billion.

Luxottica acquired Pearle Vision in 2004, combining the country&#x27;s two largest eyewear retailers. Though most locations can still provide glasses and frames same-day, that line of business has become de-emphasized over time for the luxury market.

<text>The Concertación, officially the Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia (; ), was a coalition of center-left political parties in Chile, founded in 1988. Presidential candidates under its banner won every election from when military rule ended in 1990 until the conservative candidate Sebastián Piñera won the Chilean presidential election in 2010. In 2013 it was replaced by New Majority coalition.

== History ==
In 1987 General Augusto Pinochet, the dictator of Chile, legalized political parties and called a plebiscite to determine whether or not he would remain in power after 1990. Several parties, including the Christian Democracy, the Socialist Party and the Radical Party, gathered in the Democratic Alliance (&quot;Alianza Democrática&quot;). In 1988, several more parties, including the Humanist Party, the Ecologist Party, the Social Democrats, and several Socialist Party splinter groups added their support, despite fears of election fraud by Pinochet, and the &quot;Concertación de Partidos por el NO&quot; (&quot;Coalition of Parties for NO&quot;) was formed to campaign against the continuation of Pinochet&#x27;s regime.

The parties and leaders that made the first Party Presidents&#x27; Council were:

During the election campaign, the Coalition organized a colorful and cheerful campaign under the slogan &quot;La alegría ya viene&quot; (&quot;Joy is coming&quot;). Some Socialist factions were the last to join, because they were reluctant to work in the plebiscite, fearing election fraud by Pinochet. On 5 October 1988, the &quot;NO&quot; vote won with a 54% majority, and a general election was called for 1989.

In that year, the coalition changed their name to &quot;Concertación de Partidos por la Democracia&quot; (&quot;Concert of Parties for Democracy&quot;) and put forward Patricio Aylwin, the Christian Democrat leader, as a presidential candidate, as well as launching a common list for the parliamentary elections. In elections the following year, Aylwin won and the coalition gained the majority of votes in the Chamber of Deputies. However, in Chile&#x27;s bicameral parliament, they had no majority in the Senate, a situation they found themselves in constantly for over 15 years. This forced them to negotiate all law projects with the right-wing parties, the Unión Demócrata Independiente (UDI) and Renovación Nacional (RN) (later coalesced into the Alliance for Chile).

In 1993, the coalition put forward the Christian Democrat senator Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle as a presidential candidate. Frei was the son of Eduardo Frei Montalva, the founder of the Christian Democrat Party and himself a former President of Chile (1964–1970). Gaining 57% of the votes, he defeated to the right-wing candidate, Arturo Alessandri Besa, becoming the third Christian Democrat president, and the second Coalition president.

In the same year, the Humanist Party, the Christian Left, and the Greens left the Coalition, accusing it of betraying the purpose for which it was born. The Social Democrat Party and the Radical Party joined together to form the Social Democrat Radical Party, while the various former Socialist factions became part of the Socialist Party.

Frei&#x27;s government faced two main problems: an economic crisis was raising the unemployment rate, and General Pinochet had been arrested in London. Both situations led the Coalition to fear defeat in the 1999 presidential elections.

In that year, the coalition had two possible candidates: the Christian Democrats&#x27; Andrés Zaldívar and the Socialists&#x27; Ricardo Lagos. Primary elections were held to decide between the two. Lagos won the vote, and went on to defeat the UDI&#x27;s Joaquín Lavín in the presidential election. However, since he got a plurality as opposed to a majority of the votes, a runoff vote was held, the first in Chilean history, in which Lagos won with 51% of the votes.

In 2005, two candidates were again proposed: the Christian Democrats&#x27; Soledad Alvear, a former Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Socialists&#x27; Michelle Bachelet, a former Minister of Defense. As before, the situation was to be resolved through a primary election. However, in May 2005, after months of internal disputes regarding her party&#x27;s directives, Alvear withdrew from the presidential race, deciding instead to run for senator in Santiago. Bachelet therefore became the Coalition&#x27;s candidate, and the second woman to run for Chilean President (the first being Communist leader Gladys Marín), competing with the UDI&#x27;s Joaquín Lavín and RN&#x27;s Sebastián Piñera.

On 11 December 2005, Bachelet won with 45% of the votes, but was forced to compete with Piñera in a runoff election. In the same month, the coalition won 51.25% of the votes in the parliamentary elections, gaining 20 seats in the Senate and 65 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. This gave them a majority in both Houses for the first time.

On 15 January 2006, the runoff was held. Bachelet won with nearly the 54% of the votes, becoming the first female president of Chile. She was also the fourth Coalition candidate and third Socialist to win.

<doc id="531933" wikidata="Q7604700" url="?curid=531933" title="Statutory college">
<text>In the United States, a statutory college or contract college is a higher education college or school that is a component of an independent, private university that has been designated by the state legislature to receive significant, ongoing public funding from that respective state. The statutory college is operated by the university with state funding used to serve specific educational needs of the state.

==Delaware==

The University of Delaware in Newark and Delaware State University in Dover are both chartered as a &quot;privately governed, state-assisted&quot; university. They receive about 10 percent of their operating budgets from the state.

==Florida==

Beginning in 2004, the University of Miami&#x27;s Miller School of Medicine in Miami began offering instruction on the campus of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. MD candidates are admitted to either the Miami or Boca Raton programs and spend all four years studying on the selected campus. 

The Miami and Boca Raton campuses charge identical tuition, with a lower tuition for in-state Florida students.

==New York==
In New York state, statutory colleges are administratively affiliated with the State University of New York (SUNY) system, and receive funding from SUNY&#x27;s operating budget. There are five statutory colleges: four located at Cornell University in Ithaca and one located at Alfred University in Alfred.

New York state education law uses both &quot;contract college&quot; and &quot;statutory college&quot; to describe these state-supported colleges.

===Alfred University===

The statutory college located at Alfred University in Alfred, New York is:
* New York State College of Ceramics (established 1900)

The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) consists of the School of Art and Design, with its own dean, and four state-supported materials programs cross-organized within Alfred University&#x27;s School of Engineering. The College of Ceramics is functioning technically as a &quot;holding entity&quot; (overseen by a unit head/Vice President of Statutory Affairs) for the fiscal support of the state programs and the NYSCC mission. The unit head assists with budget preparation for the two aforementioned AU schools and the NYSCC-affiliated Scholes Library of Ceramics (part of the campuswide, unified AU library system), and acts in a liaison role to SUNY.

The School of Art and Design, technically a subunit of the College of Ceramics but autonomously run with its own dean, is further subdivided into divisions. Alfred&#x27;s School of Engineering (also N b. +. run with its own dean) currently has four state-supported programs and two privately endowed programs.

===Cornell University===

The four statutory colleges at Cornell University in Ithaca are:
*New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (established 1888; contract since 1904)
*New York State College of Human Ecology (established 1919; separate college since 1925)
*New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations (established 1944)
*New York State College of Veterinary Medicine (established 1894)

Another statutory college, the New York State College of Forestry, was founded at Cornell University in 1898, but was closed in 1903 when a pending lawsuit led Gov. Odell to veto the appropriations bill that provided funding. However, forestry education was continued at Cornell as part of the College of Agriculture. The College of Forestry was later reestablished at Syracuse University in 1911. 

Two of Cornell&#x27;s current statutory colleges, the NYS College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the NYS College of Human Ecology, existed as non-state-supported colleges, as the College of Agriculture and the School of Home Economics, respectively, before state legislation was enacted to make each a state-supported entity. The NYS College of Human Ecology and the NYS College of Veterinary Medicine trace their origins to Cornell&#x27;s agriculture college. However, the College of Veterinary Medicine was actually the first statutory college in New York. The Hotel School started in 1922 as a department within Home Economics, but became a separate, endowed college in 1954.

The statutory colleges at Cornell grew out of Cornell&#x27;s designation in 1865 as New York state&#x27;s land grant college under the Morrill Act. Under the Morrill Act, Cornell received land scrip based on the population of the state, and the proceeds formed the basis of Cornell&#x27;s initial endowment. Under the terms of the Cornell&#x27;s 1865 charter from the Legislature, Cornell was obligated to teach agriculture, mechanical arts and military tactic. (Cornell was also obligated to provide free tuition to students from each assembly district.) By the 1890s, Cornell sought state funding to continue its mission in these areas, and the statutory colleges were formed as a vehicle for direct state funding. In addition, around the start of the 20th century, new federal laws provided land-grant colleges and their agricultural experiment stations and cooperative extension services with annual funding conditioned upon matching state funds. As a result, almost all of Cornell&#x27;s land grant duties were transferred to its four statutory colleges, which receive such state funds through the present.

Academic programs can be transferred between the statutory college side and the host institution. For example, when private funding was sufficient to assure operation of the hotel administration program of the College of Home Economics, it was spun off as a separate School of Hotel Administration in 1950. The Department of Agricultural Economics in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) has evolved into an undergraduate business school. In 2016, it became a school shared between CALS and a new college of business. Students still have the benefit of in-state tuition despite this reorganization.

===Syracuse University===

The New York State College of Forestry was reestablished at Syracuse University (SU) in 1911, but was never technically a statutory college. Founded first as a unit within Syracuse University, in 1913 the College was chartered as an independent state institution called &quot;The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University&quot;, with its own Board of Trustees. 

In 1948, with the establishment of the State University of New York, the College became a specialized, doctoral-degree granting institution within the multi-campus SUNY system. In 1972, the College&#x27;s name was changed to the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF); it remains administratively separate from Syracuse University. ESF students have full access to SU libraries and recreational facilities. The two institutions share a common schedule of courses, students at either institution may take courses at the other institution, and can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs. ESF students take part in joint commencement exercises in May (and receive diplomas with the seals of both Syracuse University and ESF), and ESF students may participate in all SU student activities except NCAA Division I intercollegiate sports.

The statutory colleges are not state-run; they are operated by a contracted university. Only two universities, Cornell University and Alfred University, currently are part of this system. However, the five existing statutory colleges have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception in 1948, but had no affiliation with any umbrella organization before 194). Statutory college employees legally are employees of Cornell and Alfred universities, not employees of SUNY.

The State Education Law does give the SUNY Board of Trustees the following authority. The Trustees must approve Cornell&#x27;s and Alfred&#x27;s appointment of the deans and unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges resides with SUNY. In addition to money allocated by SUNY, the colleges may be funded by tuition and fees; grants and contracts from state agencies; special state legislative funding; federal funding; and private donations.

The Education Law mandates a consolatory role for SUNY. The statutory college should consult with SUNY when it sets tuition rates. SUNY also exercises a &quot;general supervision&quot; over the statutory colleges. However, Cornell and Alfred have interpreted this to mean that SUNY does not have the right to create novel policies for the statutory colleges that are not explicitly stated in the Education Law. If there is a conflict between Cornell or Alfred and SUNY in regard to a policy or action that SUNY is requiring from Cornell or Alfred, it must be resolved by negotiation between the two parties, although there is the legal right of court appeal by either party if agreement cannot be reached. However, this legal option has never been used.

The state finances the construction of buildings for the statutory college programs, and New York State owns those buildings as well as the land beneath those buildings. Such construction is managed by the NYS University Construction Fund rather than by Cornell or Alfred.

Since statutory colleges at Cornell and Alfred receive significant state funding, tuition rates for statutory colleges and for endowed colleges are determined separately. &#x27;In-state&#x27; residents attending a statutory college pay a separate reduced rate, in contrast to their &#x27;out-of-state&#x27; counterparts&#x27; rates. When a student enrolled in a statutory college takes a class offered by an endowed college, the endowed college is reimbursed in a budget item called an &quot;accessory instruction fee.&quot; At times, statutory college students who take more than their allotted credit hours from endowed colleges were required to pay such fees themselves. Similarly, at various times, a student who matriculates into a statutory college and later transfers to an endowed college has been required to pay the difference in tuition upon the transfer.

Statutory college employees are covered by a separate pension plan and have separate pay scales and fringe benefits than their endowed college counterparts. Most of the statutory college buildings and facilities are owned by New York state.

===State University of New York and City University of New York===

SUNY performs a fiduciary role for dispersal of state funds to the statutory units. This may require periodic audits of the use of state funds within the private universities.

There is some debate about whether the statutory colleges are &quot;public&quot; or &quot;private, nonprofit&quot; entities. Legally, they are private and nonprofit; Cornell and Alfred Universities are private, nonprofit institutions, a status which extends to all of these universities&#x27; components, which are not separate corporations. Also, the employees of the statutory colleges, as currently affirmed by court rulings, are private, nonprofit employees. An analogy to this relationship is a private, nonprofit health agency which, under contract with a government, regularly receives government money to operate a research institute; the whole private, nonprofit agency (including the research institute) still remains a private, nonprofit entity. New York State&#x27;s Education Law also states that the statutory colleges do not operate as &quot;state agencies.&quot; The fact that each of the statutory colleges contains &quot;New York State&quot; in their official names does not alter the private nature of the statutory colleges; however, the importance of state funding is an important factor in the private vs. statutory unit relationship.

There are two state-supported university systems in New York state: the State University of New York, which has degree-granting units throughout the state, and the City University of New York, which only has degree-granting units in New York City. New York state&#x27;s statutory colleges are partners of SUNY and have no affiliation with CUNY.
===National Technical Institute for the Deaf===

The National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID) is a constituent school of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), located in Rochester, New York. NTID offers programs — frequently in conjunction with RIT&#x27;s other colleges/schools — tailored to deaf and hard-of-hearing students, and also offers programs to students who are not necessarily hearing-impaired but who wish to assist hearing-impaired individuals. 

United States resident students enrolled in NTID receive a reduced tuition rate which is both lower than RIT&#x27;s regular tuition rate, lower than the comparable tuition charged to NTID&#x27;s International, non-U.S.-resident enrolled students. 

NTID was created through U.S. federal legislation in 1965, and receives Federal funding to subsidize the lower, domestic tuition rate.

==Pennsylvania==

In Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth System of Higher Education recognizes a state-related status, in which an institution is provided with state funds in exchange for offering tuition discounts to students who are residents of Pennsylvania. The state allocations account for less than 10 percent of the budgets of the four institutions, Lincoln University in Oxford, Pennsylvania State University, Temple University in Philadelphia, and the University of Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh, which remain academically and administratively independent of the state. 

The University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine receives support from the state and offers in-state tuition to students who are residents of Pennsylvania.

==Texas==

Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) in Houston subsidizes the tuition of Texas residents, so they have a lower tuition rate than that charged to non-Texans who attend its M.D. program. This subsidy, intended to increase the number of physicians in Texas, was enacted in 1969, at which time the medical school became an autonomous entity in order to avoid legal conflicts arising from Baylor&#x27;s affiliation with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. State support only allays the cost of tuition for in-state students, and the state does not assist BCM with significant ongoing funding for research or outreach/extension purposes.

==International universities==

The University of St Andrews, in St Andrews, Scotland, has three units that are designated as colleges. Two of these colleges are designated as statutory colleges, which have ecclesiastical beginnings. One of these statutory colleges, United College, founded by a college merger in 1747, today exists as essentially a non-administrative entity kept for the sake of history and tradition. It houses the University&#x27;s Faculties of Arts, Medicine, and Science. 

The other statutory college, St Mary&#x27;s College, St Andrews, founded in 1538, and also in St Andrews, is coexistent with the University&#x27;s Faculty and School of Divinity. The remaining college, St Leonard&#x27;s College, is designated as &quot;non-statutory,&quot; has similar early beginnings, but was re-instituted in 1972 as a central point of administration for postgraduate students. (St Andrews students who are postgraduates, as well as the University&#x27;s postdoctoral fellows and research staff, are automatically enrolled as members of St Leonard&#x27;s College.)

<text>334 is a 1972 dystopian science fiction novel by American writer Thomas M. Disch. It is set in New York City in the year 2025, depicting a future marked by limited technological advancements, overpopulation, and stark class divisions. The title alludes to the address of the housing project where most of the characters reside, 334 East 11th Street, as well to the year 334 AD in the historical context of the decline of the Roman Empire; numerous comparisons are made between the decline of Rome and the future of the United States.

The dust cover design for the first edition was by Michael Hasted.

==Plot summary==
The future in &quot;334&quot; has brought few technological advances except for new medical techniques and recreational drugs. There have been no dramatic disasters, but overpopulation has made housing and other resources scarce; the response is a program of compulsory birth control and eugenics. A welfare state provides for basic needs through an all-encompassing agency called MODICUM, but there is an extreme class division between welfare recipients and professionals.

The novel consists of five independent novellas (previously published separately) with a common setting but different characters, and a longer sub-novel called &quot;334&quot; whose many short sections trace the members of a single family forward and backward in time. The sections are as follows:

* &quot;The Death of Socrates&quot;: A high-school student finds that, due to poor scores on his Regents Examinations and his father&#x27;s health history, he has been permanently forbidden to have children; he searches for ways to get extra credit.
* &quot;Bodies&quot;: Porters at Bellevue Hospital moonlight as body-snatchers catering to a necrophiliac brothel. Their task is complicated by the desire of some patients to be cryonically preserved for a better future.
* &quot;Everyday Life in the Later Roman Empire&quot;: A privileged government worker, trying to decide where to send her son to school, pursues a parallel existence in a hallucinogen-assisted role-playing game set in the year 334.
* &quot;Emancipation: A Romance of the Times to Come&quot;: A young professional man and woman face marital conflicts and parenthood, with several twists unique to the 2020s.
* &quot;Angouleme&quot;: A group of highly educated prepubescent children decides to commit a gratuitous murder in Battery Park.
* &quot;334&quot;: Vignettes of the Hanson family from 2021 to 2025.

==Characters==
* Mrs. Hanson: An elderly widow living at 334. Mother to Lottie, Shrimp, and Boz.
* Lottie Hanson: An unemployed single mother living at 334.
* Shrimp Hanson: Considered genetically desirable for her unusual intelligence, therefore has a free pass from the government to have children, although she is actually motivated by a fetish for artificial insemination.
* Boz Hanson: Unemployed, former resident of 334, managed to leave by marrying Milly.
* Milly Holt: A professional sex demonstrator for the high schools. Was Birdie&#x27;s girlfriend, now married to Boz.
* Ab Holt: Manages the morgue at Bellevue Hospital. Milly&#x27;s father.
* Birdie Ludd: A high-school student living as a &quot;temp&quot; in a stairwell of 334.
* Frances Schaap: A prostitute living at 334. Like many people in the 2020s, she has lupus.
* Alexa Miller: A MODICUM administrator, responsible for the Hansons.
* Tancred Miller: Alexa&#x27;s son.
* Amparo Martinez: Lottie&#x27;s daughter.
* Bill Harper, aka Little Mister Kissy Lips: Son of a television executive, classmate of Tancred and Amparo.

==Critical reception==
&quot;334&quot; was selected by David Pringle as one of the 100 best science-fiction novels written since World War II.

Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s &quot;The American Shore&quot; (1978) is a book-length critical essay on the novella &quot;Angouleme&quot;; Delany argues that despite the lack of any scientific themes in &quot;Angouleme&quot;, its speculative setting makes it inherently science fiction.

The novel was nominated for a 1974 Nebula Award. Previously, the novella &quot;334&quot; won a Locus Poll Award in 1973.

<text>The Solomon Islands [[rain forests]] are a terrestrial ecoregion covering the Solomon Islands archipelago.

==Geography==
The ecoregion covers the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is divided between the countries of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. The archipelago&#x27;s northern islands, Bougainville and Buka, are part of Papua New Guinea. The rest of the archipelago is within the nation of Solomon Islands. The ecoregion excludes the eastern islands of the nation of Solomon Islands, the Santa Cruz Islands, which lie in the Vanuatu rain forests ecoregion together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. The archipelago extends approximately 1450 km from northwest to southeast, between 5° and 12° South latitude.

Bougainville is the largest island, about 200 km long and from 50 to 60 km wide with an area of almost 9000 km2. The island has a central mountain range, the northern part of which is known as the Emperor Range, and the southern part, separated by a lower saddle, as the Crown Prince Range. Mount Balbi in the Emperor Range, at 2,715 metres elevation, is the highest peak in the archipelago. Volcanic rocks are common, with dating back approximately 30 million years. The Panguna mine in the Crown Prince Range, currently closed, is one of the largest copper mines on earth. The Keriaka Plateau in northwest Bougainville, south of Mount Balbi, is a karst plateau formed of weathered foraminiferous limestone dating to the lower Miocene.

Buka Island lies northwest of Bougainville, separated by a narrow strait. Much of the island is made up of uplifted Pleistocene coralline limestone.

The rest of the archipelago extends southeast of Bougainville as a double chain. The outer or northeastern chain comprises the islands of Choiseul, Santa Isabel, and Malaita, which are each about 200 km long and 30 km wide. The islands have mountainous interiors extending above 1000 m on Choiseul, 1200 m on Santa Isabel, and 1300 m on Malaita.

The inner chain extends from Shortland Island, 20 km southeast of Bougainville, and includes Vella Lavella, Ganongga, Kolombangara, the New Georgia Islands (New Georgia, Rendova, Vangunu, and Nggatokae), the low coralline Russell Islands, Guadalcanal, and San Cristobal. Guadalcanal has the highest mountains of the inner and outer chains, and Mount Popomanaseu on Guadalcanal is the highest peak outside Bougainville at 2331 metres elevation. Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, is on the north shore of Guadalcanal. The inner chain islands are mostly below 1000 meters elevation, with the exception of the conical stratovolcano Kolombangara which reaches 1,770 metres.

Most of the inner and outer chain islands are made up of volcanic rocks, including andesite and basalt. Guadalcanal has the most complex geology, with areas of andesite volcanics, intrusive plutonic rocks, Pliocene sedimentary rocks, and uplifted Pleistocene coralline limestone in the northern lowlands near Honiara. There are outcrops of ultramafic rock, rich in chromium and nickel, on five islands – at Santa Isabel&#x27;s southern tip, on the nearby island of San Jorge, in the Florida Islands, in southwestern Guadalcanal, and in north-central San Cristobal. These rocks are toxic to many plants, and are often home to distinctive plant communities.

The archipelago includes two groups of low coralline outlying islands – Ontong Java, northeast of the outer chain and 450 km north of Honiara, and Rennell and Bellona, south of San Cristobal and 250 km south of Honiara.

The ecoregion is part of the Australasian realm, which also includes the neighbouring Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea, as well as New Caledonia, Australia and New Zealand. Floristically it is the easternmost part of the Papuasia region, which includes New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago.

==Climate==
The islands have a humid tropical climate. Rainfall averages between 3000 and 5000 mm annually at most sea-level stations. There is little seasonal variation in temperature, with seasonal variation in rainfall depending on the prevailing winds. The southeast trade winds are active from about March to October when the sun is north of the equator. February-March and November-December are unsettled weather periods when the islands can get drenched with convectional rains. Winds come from the northwest from December to February. The southern islands can experience tropical cyclones, which usually develop between November and April. Guadalcanal&#x27;s relatively high east-west running mountains create a rain shadow effect in the island&#x27;s northeastern lowlands, with lower rainfall during the southwest trade wind season than elsewhere in the archipelago.

Temperatures above 700 meters elevation are generally 4 to 5 °C cooler than the lowlands, with mean annual temperatures of 22 to 23 °C. The highlands experience cloud cover during the southeast trade wind season, and windward slopes have higher rainfall than the lowlands.

==Flora==

The natural vegetation of the Solomon archipelago consists mostly of lowland and montane tropical rain forests. The major plant communities include coastal strand, mangrove forests, freshwater swamp forests, lowland rain forests, and montane rain forests. Seasonally-dry forests and grasslands are found on the northern (leeward) slopes of Guadalcanal.

Lowland forests are made up of trees up to 35 meters high forming a closed canopy, with &quot;Vitex cofassus&quot; and &quot;Pometia pinnata&quot; as common canopy trees along with species of &quot;Ficus, Alstonia, Celtis, Elaeocarpus, Canarium, Syzygium, Calophyllum, Didymocheton, Dysoxylum, Terminalia&quot;, and &quot;Sterculia&quot;. Understorey plants include the palms &quot;Licuala, Caryota&quot;, and &quot;Areca&quot;, bamboos, tree ferns (&quot;Cyathea&quot; sp.), &quot;Pandanus&quot;, and giant herbs. Bananas, gingers, lianas, and rattans grow forest gaps where sunlight reaches through the canopy. Epiphytes, particularly ferns and orchids, grow abundantly on the forest trees.

Montane forests in the Solomons share many species with the lowland forests, and differ primarily having a lower canopy height – 20 to 25 meters. The Solomons&#x27; montane forests are absent many of the tree species characteristic of montane forests in the Bismarcks and New Guinea, including &quot;Nothofagus&quot; (southern beech) and Fagaceae (species of &quot;Castanopsis&quot; and &quot;Lithocarpus&quot;).

On Bougainville, lowland forest transitions to submontane forest above 750 to 800 metres elevation extending up to 1500 metres or higher. Submontane forests have a lower canopy, 25 to 30 metres high, dominated by species of &quot;Garcinia&quot; and &quot;Elaeocarpus&quot;, together with species of &quot;Dillenia, Schizomeria, Syzygium, Casuarina, Alphitonia, Cryptocarya&quot;, and &quot;Bischofia javanica&quot;. Characteristic submontane plants include &quot;Neonauclea, Sloanea, Cryptocarya, Palaquium, Canarium&quot;, and &quot;Ficus&quot;.

Above 1500 metres elevation on Bougainville the forests transition to montane scrub of &quot;Pandanus&quot; and the palm &quot;Hydriastele macrospadix&quot;, or tree fern (&quot;Cyathea&quot; sp.) and bamboo scrub on more recent volcanic deposits, with pockets of submontane forest in sheltered areas with deeper soils.

In northern Guadalcanal, where the rain shadow of the mountains creates drier conditions from June to October, there are areas of mixed-deciduous forest and grassland. The mixed-deciduous forest has an open, fragmented canopy with &quot;Pometia pinnata, Vitex cofassus&quot;, and &quot;Kleinhovia hospita&quot; common. Deciduous trees include &quot;Pterocarpus indicus, Antiaris toxicaria&quot;, and species of &quot;Ficus&quot; and &quot;Sterculia&quot;. Small and understorey trees include the poisonous &quot;Semecarpus&quot; spp., &quot;Colona scabra&quot;, and &quot;Cananga odorata&quot;. Mixed-deciduous forest extends into grasssland areas as gallery forest along streams and rivers.

Tall grasslands extend about 30 km east from Honiara. They are dominated by &quot;Themeda triandra&quot; growing 1 meter or taller, along with &quot;Phragmites karka&quot; and various introduced grasses including &quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot; and &quot;Setaria parviflora&quot;.

&quot;Hydriastele hombronii&quot; is a palm endemic to outcrops of ultrabasic soil on Choiseul, Santa Isabel, and several other islands.

==Fauna==
The islands are home to 47 native mammal species, limited to bats and murid rodents. 26 species are endemic or near-endemic – 17 species of bats, and nine species of murid rodent. Endemic murid rodents are the Bougainville mosaic-tailed rat (&quot;Melomys bougainville&quot;), Buka Island mosaic-tailed rat (&quot;Melomys spechti&quot;), Poncelet&#x27;s giant rat &quot;Solomys ponceleti&quot;), Ugi naked-tailed rat (&quot;Solomys salamonis&quot;), Bougainville naked-tailed rat (&quot;Solomys salebrosus&quot;), Isabel naked-tailed rat (&quot;Solomys sapientis&quot;), Emperor rat (&quot;Uromys imperator&quot;), Guadalcanal rat (&quot;Uromys porculus&quot;), and king rat (&quot;Uromys rex&quot;).

199 bird species are native to the Solomon archipelago, of which 69 species are endemic. The ecoregion corresponds to the Solomon group endemic bird area.

==People==
The first evidence of human inhabitation of the archipelago is at Kilu Cave on Buka, dating back 29,000 years ago to the Pleistocene. The settlers likely crossed the sea from the Bismarck Archipelago. At the time sea levels were lower, and New Ireland was separated from the Solomons by 180 km. The lower sea levels also joined several of the islands, including Buka, Bougainville, Choiseul, Santa Isabel, and the Florida Islands, into a single island known as Greater Bougainville or Greater Bukida.

Early settlers were likely highly mobile hunter-gatherers. Evidence from Kilu Cave show that early residents hunted bats, reptiles, rats, and birds from at least six families including several species of pigeon, a megapode, and a rail, along with marine shells and fish bones indicating inshore fishing. Residents also ate starches from taro (&quot;Colocasia esculenta&quot;) and &quot;Alocasia&quot; sp. The nut-producing trees &quot;Canarium indicum&quot; and &quot;Canarium salomonense&quot; were introduced to the Solomons from the New Guinea mainland about 10,000 years ago. Sea levels rose to close to current levels between 5500 and 6000 years before present (B.P.). Lapita settlers, the ancestors of today&#x27;s Oceanic Austronesian peoples, arrived by 3400 B.P., and introduced the marsupial gray cuscus (&quot;Phalanger orientalis&quot;) to the islands.

The people of the Solomons today are diverse in culture and language. Between 70 and 80 languages are spoken in the archipelago. There is a cultural distinction between “salt-water” and “bush” people, with bush people dwelling inland with lifestyles and traditions centred on the forest and gardens, and “salt water” people dwelling near the coast with a lifestyle and culture oriented to the sea. In parts of the archipelago, like the Western Solomons, the island interiors are now little inhabited.

Many islanders engage in subsistence gardening. Bush fallowing is common practice, rotating gardens in a confined area of forest over relatively short period, then leaving sections fallow so that shrub-forest and soil fertility can recover. Primary forest trees which produce edible nuts and fruits, including &quot;Canarium&quot; species, &quot;Barringtonia&quot; species, &quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;, and &quot;Pangium edule&quot;, are usually retained when shrub-forest is cleared for gardens.

==Conservation and threats==

Most of the mountain forests are relatively intact, while areas of the lowlands have been cleared for farms and gardens and plantations of coconut (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;) and other food, fiber, timber-producing trees. Much of the grassland east of Honiara has been replaced by plantations of oil palm (&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;). 

Commercial logging began in the 1920s, and has removed large areas of forest across the archipelago, mostly in the lowlands. Kolombangara is one of the most intensively logged islands in the archipelago. Clear-cut logging began in the 1960s, and by 2012 less than 10% of the island&#x27;s primary forest remained, restricted to inaccessible ridgetops, ravines, and within the central crater.

1.2% of the ecoregion is in protected areas. They include Queen Elizabeth National Park on Guadalcanal (10.9 km2), East Rennell World Heritage Site (370 km2) on Rennell Island, Kolombangara Forest Reserve (200 km2) on Kolombangara, and Padezaka Tribal Forest Conservation Area (48.23 km2), Sirebe Forest Conservation Area (8.0 km2), Siporae Tribal Forest Conservation Area (6.66 km2), and Vuri Forest Conservation Area (5.74 km2) on Choiseul.

<text>The China National Aviation Corporation () was a Chinese airline which was nationalized after the Chinese Communist Party took control in 1949, and merged into the People&#x27;s Aviation Company of China () in 1952. It was a major airline under the Nationalist government of China until the 90s.

It was headquartered in Shanghai as of 1938.

==History==
On 5 April 1929 the Executive Yuan of the Nationalist government of China based in Nanjing established the Chinese National Aviation Corporation, a state owned company with an authorized capital of ten million yuan. Sun Fo, Minister of Railways and son of Sun Yat Sen served as its first chairman although the real power lay with the Minister of Communications, Wang Boqun.

Two weeks later on 17 April, the Nationalists entered into a service contract with an American firm, Aviation Exploration Inc which was to establish air routes between a few of the major treaty ports and manage all operations. Aviation Exploration Inc was a personal holding company of the U.S. aviation magnate Clement Melville Keys who at the same time was the president of Curtiss-Wright and a few other aviation firms. In June 1929, Keys set up China Airways Federal to manage the new airmail routes between Canton, Shanghai and Hankou.

This new Sino-American venture faced acute resistance from military factions in South China: warlords had their own small air forces which had ambitions to earn income from airmail service between the treaty ports. Even more ominous was the opposition from Wang Po-chun the Minister of Communications; in July 1929, he went ahead and set up an airmail service, Shanghai-Chengtu Airways, owned entirely by his ministry. Wang imported Stinson planes and competed with China Airways Federal on the Shanghai-Hankou route. He became in effect the father of China&#x27;s civil aviation.

Despite all the odds, on 21 October 1929, China Airways Federal launched the airmail and passenger service with an inaugural flight from Shanghai to Hankou. It continued to face overwhelming political and financial difficulties, not least from the Ministry of Communications which not only collected airmail revenue from its own service but from that of China Airways Federal.

By the start of 1930 China Airways Federal was at the point of bankruptcy and threatened to stop operations altogether unless the Ministry of Communications released its revenue. An old China hand named Max Polin managed to broker a new deal between China Airways Federal and the Ministry of Communication. On 8 July, the two rival airmail operators merged into a reconfigured China National Aviation Corporation, which thereafter was better known by its acronym, CNAC. The Chinese government had a 55 percent share and Keys&#x27; interests had a 45 percent share in CNAC. The Keys share in CNAC wound up in Intercontinent Aviation, another holding company that he had established in 1929 to handle foreign airline investments; by that stage Intercontinent itself had become part of North American Aviation, another firm founded by Keys in 1928. From 1931 until 1948 William Langhorne Bond was operations manager and vice-president of China National Aviation Corporation

By 1933, Keys had retired under a cloud of scandal and near bankruptcy. Thomas Morgan was his successor as the head of Curtiss-Wright which through cross holdings ultimately controlled both North American and Intercontinent. After a series of disastrous accidents and disagreements with Chinese leaders, Morgan decided to sell the 45 percent stake held by Intercontinent in CNAC to Pan American Airways: on 1 April 1933. Morgan concluded the sale with PanAm president Juan Trippe. Trippe almost immediately put PanAm vice-president Harold Bixby in charge of the airline&#x27;s new far east operation: Bixby was well known in banking and aviation circles as the man who had put up the money for the trans-Atlantic flight of Charles Lindbergh in the &quot;Spirit of St Louis&quot;.

Between 1937 and December 1941, CNAC flew many internal routes with Douglas Dolphin amphibians (Route No. 3, from Shanghai – Canton, via Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Amoy &amp; Shantou), and Douglas DC-2s and DC-3s. In addition, three examples of the Vultee V-1A single-engine transport that &quot;missed the boat&quot; to Republican Spain ended up in China. Initially, the Nationalists maintained contact with the outside world through the port of Hanoi in French Indo-China, but the Japanese put pressure on the new pro-Vichy regime there to cut off relations with them in 1940–41. Flying in mainland China during the war with Japan was dangerous. A CNAC aircraft was the first passenger aircraft in history to be destroyed by enemy forces, in the Kweilin Incident in August 1938.

By fall 1940, CNAC operated service from Chongqing (via Kunming and Lashio) to Rangoon, Chengdu, Jiading (via Luzhou and Yibin) and Hong Kong (via Guilin).

As the Japanese blockade of materials, fuel and various supplies severely strangulated China&#x27;s already-deprived war effort, particularly with the continued Battles of Chengdu-Chongqing, Lanzhou, Changsha, Kunming, the looming Japanese invasion of Burma, Major General Mao Bangchu of the Nationalist Air Force of China was tasked with leading the exploration of suitable air-routes over the dangerous Himalayas in 1941; as a result, CNAC pilot Xia Pu recorded the first flight between Dinjan, Burma, to Kunming, China in what was to become the route now known as &quot;The Hump&quot; in November of that year.

On 8, 9 and 10 December 1941, eight American pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and their crews made a total of 16 trips between Kai Tak Airport in the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong, then under attack from Japanese forces, and Chongqing, the wartime capital of the Republic of China. Together they made 16 sorties and evacuated 275 persons including Soong Ching-ling (the widow of Sun Yat-sen), and the Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung.

During World War II, CNAC was headquartered in India, and flew supplies from Assam, India, into Yunnan, southwestern China through the Hump Route over the Himalayas, after the Japanese blocked the Burma Road. Despite the large casualties inflicted by the Japanese and more significantly, the ever-changing weather over the Himalayas, the logistics flights operated daily, year round, from April 1942 until the end of the war. The CNAC was a smaller part of the overall re-supply operations which included the USAAF&#x27;s India-China Division of Air Transport Command.

After World War II, in 1946, CNAC moved from India to Shanghai, specifically Longhua Airport, located on the western shore of the Huangpu River, 10 km from the center of Shanghai. The company was a huge organization, with departments for transportation, mechanics, medicine, food, finance, etc. The employees who numbered in the thousands were housed in dormitories located in the Shanghai French Concession. Every morning, the company took the employees by a car convoy from the dormitories to the airport.

CNAC eventually operated routes from Shanghai to Beiping, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, using Douglas DC-2 and DC-3 aircraft. Apart from purchasing war surplus planes, CNAC had also acquired brand new Douglas DC-4s, to serve the route between Shanghai and San Francisco.

The downfall of CNAC&#x27;s operations came on 9 November 1949, when managing director of CNAC, Colonel CY Liu, and general manager of CATC (), Colonel CL Chen with a skeleton crew defected with 12 aircraft in unauthorized take-offs from Hong Kong Kai Tak Airport to Communist-controlled China. The lead aircraft (Convair 240) was welcomed with pomp and ceremony in Beijing, while the other 11 landed safely in Tianjin. The aircraft were pursued by Nationalist fighter planes but were shielded by heavy cloud cover. The remaining airline staff with their families (a total of 3,400) snuck into China by land or sea later. The ideology behind the defection was nationalism as they believed that the Communist Party would best lead one, strong China. On 1 August 1950, both companies came back to operate services. Later they were merged to form the People&#x27;s Aviation Company of China in May 1952, and eventually became part of CAAC Airlines in June 1953. Today the original Convair 240 (with one engine missing) is on display at a Military Aviation Museum in Beijing. Liu left China in 1971 for Australia where he died in May 1973.

The remaining 71 aircraft in Hong Kong were sold by the Nationalists, who had retreated to the island of Taiwan, to the Delaware-registered Civil Air Transport Inc (CAT) in an effort to save the aircraft from the Communists. After a lengthy legal battle (which went on appeal from Hong Kong to Privy Council in UK, as reported in 1951 Appeal Cases) the planes were delivered by the Hong Kong government to CAT in 1952.

Moon Fun Chin, who flew supplies over the dangerous Hump Campaign to resupply the Chinese during World War Two, was the last surviving CNAC pilot. He died on 9 May 2023 at age 110.

<doc id="531951" wikidata="Q531128" url="?curid=531951" title="Arlie Russell Hochschild">
<text>Arlie Russell Hochschild (; born January 15, 1940) is an American professor emeritus of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley and writer. Hochschild has long focused on the human emotions that underlie moral beliefs, practices, and social life generally. She is the author of ten books, including &quot;Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame, and the Rise of the Right&quot; (The New Press, September 10, 2024), which explores life in a struggling Appalachian town, and focuses on the political appeal to undeserved lost pride. The book was chosen by Barack Obama as one of his ten &quot;favorite books of 2024.&quot; It is a follow-up to her last book, &quot;Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right&quot;, a &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award. Journalist Derek Thompson described it as &quot;a Rosetta stone&quot; for understanding the rise of Donald Trump.

In these and other books, she continues the sociological tradition of C. Wright Mills by drawing links between private troubles and public issues. In drawing this link, she has tried to illuminate the ways we recognize, attend to, appraise, evoke, and suppress—that is to say, manage—emotion. She has applied this focus to the family, to work, and to political life. Her works have been translated into 17 languages. She is also the author of a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;Coleen The Question Girl,&quot; illustrated by Gail Ashby.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and family background ===
Arlie Hochschild was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Ruth Alene (Libbey) and Francis Henry Russell, a diplomat who served in Israel, New Zealand, Ghana, and Tunisia. In her 2016 book, &quot;Strangers in Their Own Land&quot;, Hochschild says that her first experiences reaching out and getting to know people different from her stem from her own childhood idea that she was &quot;daddy&#x27;s helper&quot; - ( probably not an idea he shared, she later reflects).

She married Adam Hochschild in 1965 and they have two sons, David and Gabriel. In 1964, she and Adam were civil rights workers in Vicksburg, Mississippi.

=== Education and academic career ===
Hochschild graduated from Swarthmore College in 1962 with a major in International Relations. She earned her MA (1965) and PhD (1969) from the University of California, Berkeley, whose faculty she joined after teaching at the University of California, Santa Cruz from 1969 to 1971.

==Areas of research==
Using in-depth interviews and observation, Hochschild&#x27;s research has taken her into various social worlds. She has written about residents in a low-income housing project for the elderly (&quot;The Unexpected Community&quot;), flight attendants and bill collectors who perform &quot;emotional labor&quot; (&quot;The Managed Heart)&quot;, working parents struggling to divide housework and childcare (&quot;The Second Shift&quot;), corporate employees dealing with a culture of workaholism (&quot;The Time Bind&quot;). She has also interviewed child and eldercare workers, internet-dating assistants, wedding planners (&quot;The Outsourced Self)&quot; and Filipina nannies who&#x27;ve left their children behind to care for those of American families (&quot;Global Woman&quot;). Her 2013 &quot;So How&#x27;s the Family and Other Essays&quot; is a collection that includes essays on emotional labor—when do we enjoy it and when not?—empathy, and personal strategies for trying to have fun and “make meaning” in a life with little family time.

Her last two research projects have focused on the rise of the political right. &quot;Strangers in Their Own Land&quot; is based on five years of immersion research among Louisiana supporters of the Tea Party. Why, she asks, do residents of the nation&#x27;s second poorest state vote for candidates who resist federal help? Why, in a highly polluted state, do voters prefer politicians reluctant to regulate polluting industries? Her search for answers led her to the concept of the &quot;deep story.” The book was a National Book Award finalist, as well as one of the top ten best non-fiction books of the decade by the Boston Public Library.

In her forthcoming &quot;Stolen Pride: Loss, Shame, and the Rise of the Right&quot;, she locates herself in the nation&#x27;s whitest and second poorest congressional district, where she finds residents facing a “perfect storm.” Coal jobs had gone. A tragic drug crisis had arrived. And in 2017, a white nationalist march was coming to town—a rehearsal, as it turned out, for the deadly Unite the Right march soon to take place in Charlottesville, Virginia. Once at the political center of the country, the district voted 80% for Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020. Hochschild explores a people&#x27;s strong culture of pride and struggle with  unwarranted shame, and finds in this a lens through which to see politics in America today, and in many other times and places.

===Emotion in social life: Feeling rules and emotional labor===

Hochschild proposes that human emotions—joy, sadness, anger, elation, jealousy, envy, despair—are partly social. Each culture, she argues, provides its members with prototypes of feeling which, like the different keys on a piano, attune us to different inner notes. She provides an example of the Tahitians, who have one word, &quot;sick,&quot; for what in other cultures might correspond to envy, depression, grief, or sadness. Culture guides the act of recognizing a feeling by proposing what&#x27;s possible for us to feel. In &quot;The Managed Heart&quot;, Hochschild cites the Czech novelist Milan Kundera, who writes that the Czech word &quot;litost&quot; refers to an indefinable longing, mixed with remorse and grief—a constellation of feelings with no equivalent in any other language. It is not that non-Czechs never feel litost, she notes; it is that they are not, in the same way, invited to lift out and affirm the feeling.

We don&#x27;t simply feel what we feel, Hochschild suggests. We &quot;try to&quot; feel the way we wish to or think we should feel based on socially derived feeling rules. And we do this through emotional labor. For example, in &quot;The Managed Heart&quot;, Hochschild writes of how flight attendants are trained to control passengers&#x27; feelings during times of turbulence and dangerous situations while suppressing their own fear or anxiety. Bill collectors, as well, are often trained to imagine debtors as lazy or dishonest, so they can feel suspicious and intimidating. As the number of service jobs grows, so too do different forms of emotional labor. In the era of COVID-19, she argues, many front-line workers do the emotional labor of suppressing heightened anxieties about their own health and that of their families while dealing with the fear, anxiety and sometimes hostility of the public.

Emotional labor has gone global, she argues. In her essay, &quot;Love and Gold,&quot; in &quot;Global Woman&quot; she describes immigrant care workers who leave their children and elderly back in the Philippines, Mexico or elsewhere in the global South, to take paid jobs caring for the young and elderly in families in the affluent North. Such jobs call on workers to manage grief and anguish vis-a-vis their own long-unseen children, spouses, and elderly parents, even as they try to feel—and genuinely do feel—warm attachment to the children and elders they daily care for in the North. Hochschild describes such a pattern as a global care chain.

=== Work and family ===

In other books, Hochschild applies her perspective on emotion to the American family. In &quot;The Second Shift&quot;, she argues that the family has been stuck in a &quot;stalled revolution.&quot; Most mothers work for pay outside the home; that is the revolution. But the jobs they have and the men they come home to haven&#x27;t changed as rapidly or deeply as she has; that is the stall. Hochschild traces links between a couple&#x27;s division of labor and their underlying &quot;economy of gratitude.&quot; Who, she asks, is grateful to whom, and for what?

In &quot;The Time Bind&quot;, Hochschild studied working parents at a Fortune 500 company dealing with an important contradiction. On one hand, nearly everyone she talked to told her that &quot;my family comes first.&quot; However, when she asked informants &quot;Where do you get help when you need it?&quot; or &quot;Where are you most rewarded for what you do, work or home?&quot; for some 20 percent the answer was &quot;at work.&quot; For them, &quot;family becomes like work and work takes on the feel and tone of the family.&quot;

In an interview with the &quot;Journal of Consumer Culture&quot;, Hochschild describes how capitalism plays a role in one&#x27;s &quot;imaginary self&quot;—the self we would be if only we had time.

=== Disengagement theory ===
In her earlier work, Hochschild critiqued the disengagement theory of aging. According to that theory, inevitably and universally, through disengagement, the individual experiences a social death before they experience physical death. But in the low-income housing project she studied for her PhD Dissertation and later published as &quot;The Unexpected Community,&quot; she discovered among the lively group of elderly residents a culture of continued engagement. When they died, it seemed, it was &quot;with their boots on.&quot; Across the world, she suggests, individuals differ in their ideals of aging, in the feeling rules they apply to life, and may even differ in the very experience of death.

==Honors==

Hochschild has received honorary degrees from Harvard University (2021), the University of Lausanne, Switzerland (2018), Westminster College, Pennsylvania (2018), Mount St. Vincent University, Canada (2013), the University of Lapland, Finland (2012), Aalborg University, Denmark (2004), the University of Oslo, Norway (2000), and Swarthmore College (1993). She also received the Ulysses Medal from University College Dublin, Ireland (2015) and the Helmholtz Medal from the Berlin Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2024.
She was also inducted into the California Hall of Fame (2022).

<text>Pinus muricata, the bishop pine, is a pine with a very restricted range: mostly in California, including several offshore Channel Islands, and a few locations in Baja California, Mexico. It is always on or near the coast.

In San Luis Obispo County it is found alone or in stands scattered on the coastal mountains and hills from Morro Bay to Shell Beach. A few stands of the tree are seen on the hills above the Sycamore Canyon Resort in Avila Beach. Within the City of San Luis Obispo, the Terrace Hill Open Space has several scattered specimens. Bishop pine seems to prefer already disturbed, unvegetated areas where it probably faces less competition from oaks and shrubs.

The common name &quot;bishop pine&quot; resulted from the tree having been first identified near the Mission of San Luis Obispo in San Luis Obispo, California. This tree has a large number of common names and other prior scientific names, due primarily to numerous variant forms. Other English names that have occasionally been used are prickle cone pine, Obispo pine, Santa Cruz pine and dwarf marine pine.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus muricata&quot; is a coniferous evergreen tree growing to a height of , rarely up to , with a trunk diameter of up to . The species is often smaller, stunted and twisted in coastal exposures. It is drought-tolerant and grows on dry, rocky soil.
The needles are in pairs, green to blue-green, and long. Cones occur in one to five clusters. The cones are strongly reflexed down the branch, long; the scales are stiff, thin on the side of the cone facing the stem, but greatly thickened on the side facing away and with a stout spine; both features adaptive to minimise squirrel predation and fire damage to the cones. The cones remain unopened for many years until fire or strong heat causes them to open and release the seeds.
==Forms==
There are two &quot;Pinus muricata&quot; forms: 
* a southern form with bright green needles
* a northern form with dark blue-green needles.

The resin composition also differs. The dividing line between the two is very sharp, five miles (8 km) south of the boundary between Mendocino County and Sonoma County, California. Experimental attempts to hybridize the two forms have consistently failed, indicating that their taxonomic relationship may be more distant than the very small differences in appearance would suggest.

==Ecology==

&quot;Pinus muricata&quot; is found with several oak and cypress associates within the California Coast Ranges. There are also a number of common understory flora associates including sword fern, salal and western poison oak. Notable occurrences of &quot;P. muricata&quot; is in association with Mendocino cypress as a pygmy forest on coastal terraces in Mendocino County and Sonoma County, including one location within Salt Point State Park. It is classified an endangered species in Mexico.

==Uses==
&quot;Pinus muricata&quot; has been used in plantations with resultant growth rates higher than in the wild, but with adverse impacts to biodiversity.

This plant has ornamental value, and is cultivated in parks and gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="531972" wikidata="Q1955518" url="?curid=531972" title="Polistes">
<text>Polistes is a cosmopolitan genus of paper wasps and the only genus in the tribe Polistini. Vernacular names for the genus include umbrella wasps, coined by Walter Ebeling in 1975 to distinguish it from other types of paper wasp, in reference to the form of their nests, and umbrella paper wasps. &quot;Polistes&quot; is the single largest genus within the family Vespidae, with over 200 recognized species. Their innate preferences for nest-building sites leads them to commonly build nests on human habitation, where they can be very unwelcome; although generally not aggressive, they can be provoked into defending their nests. All species are predatory, and they may consume large numbers of caterpillars, in which respect they are generally considered beneficial.
==Description==
As part of subfamily Polistinae, &quot;Polistes&quot; wasps are covered in short and inconspicuous hair, have a clypeus with a pointed apex, have a gena that is wide throughout, tergum 1 of the metasoma is almost straight to gently arched in profile, the tibia of the mid leg has two spurs, and the legs end in simple tarsal claws. The genus can be distinguished from other Polistinae by a sessile metasoma (the first segment at most slightly longer than wide) and the fourth tarsomeres of the mid and hind legs being symmetrical.

&quot;Polistes&quot; show sexual dimorphism, with males having seven externally visible metasomal segments whereas females have six. This trait is shared with other vespid wasps.

&quot;Polistes&quot; species have single-layered nests which are shaped like an umbrella, with the cells exposed to the air from the bottom, and no layer wrapping around the nest. The nests are suspended from a surface by a petiole and are constructed from a paper-like substance made of a mix of saliva and wood fibres chewed off old and soft wood or dead twigs. Many &quot;Polistes&quot; species in general often have nests supported by a longer petiole than those of &quot;Vespula&quot;.

==Biochemistry==
Similar to many insects, Carlson et al 1998 finds &quot;Polistes&quot; cuticular hydrocarbons to be predominantly many branched, methyl branched alkanes. The reviews of Nelson 1978, Lockey 1988 and Nelson 1993 concur.

==Life cycle==
The general life cycle of &quot;Polistes&quot; can be divided into four phases:
#Founding (or pre-emergence) phase
#Worker phase
#Reproductive phase
#Intermediate phase

===Founding (or pre-emergence) phase===
The founding stage begins in the spring when a solitary female (the &quot;foundress&quot;) (or a small group of related females) initiates the construction of a nest. The wasps begin by fashioning a petiole, a short stalk which will connect the new nest to a substrate (often the eave of a house or outbuilding), and building a single brood cell at the end of it. Further cells are added laterally in a hexagonal pattern, each cell surrounded by six others. Although nests can achieve impressive sizes, they almost always maintain a basic shape: petiolated (stellocyttarous), single-combed, unprotected, and open (gymnodomous).

Eggs are laid by the foundress directly into the brood cells and are guarded by the foundress and the assisting females (if present). After the first larvae hatch, the foundress feeds them via progressive provisioning, bringing softened caterpillar flesh to the larvae multiple times throughout their development (as opposed to the one-time provisioning seen in some other hymenopteran groups). Each of this first seasonal brood of new paper wasps is exclusively female and destined to a subordinate worker position inside the nest; they do not found their own nests and instead assist their mother in the care and maintenance of future sisters.

Some foundress wasps do not build their own nests, but rather attempt to usurp that of another female. These usurpation attempts may or may not be successful, but almost always result in impressive displays of aggression and violence. Females may also adopt a more peaceful alternative reproduction strategy by joining the nest of a close relative (usually a sister) and working as assisting females. In the latter case, such cofounding females are generally, but not exclusively, close relatives.

===Worker phase===
The worker phase usually begins in the early summer, roughly two months after colony initiation, with the emergence of the first workers. These new females take up most of the colony&#x27;s work duties, foraging, caring for brood, and maintaining the structure of the nest. Around this time, those females which assisted in nest foundation (if present) are driven from the nest by aggressive behavior on the part of the foundress, and leave either to start their own late-season nests or usurp another&#x27;s.

===Reproductive phase===
The reproductive phase of the colony begins when the first female reproductives (the gynes) emerge from their brood cells. These reproductives differ from their worker sisters by having increased levels of fat stores and cryoprotectant carbohydrate compounds (allowing them to survive the overwintering period). These reproductives contribute genes directly to the next generation, while their worker sisters normally pass along their genes indirectly.

===Intermediate phase===
Once male reproductives emerge and both males and females disperse from the natal nest for mating flights, the so-called intermediate phase begins. Brood care and foraging behavior decline and worker numbers drop as dying individuals are no longer replaced by new ones. Intracolonial aggression increases and the social cohesion of the nest declines. In temperate &quot;Polistes&quot; species, individuals (almost exclusively inseminated females) gather in groups of up to 50 individuals and seek a sheltered location (called a hibernaculum) in which to overwinter.

==Behavior==
===Kin selection===

The reproductive behavior of &quot;Polistes&quot; wasps provided some of the first evidence for the mathematical biologist W. D. Hamilton&#x27;s 1964 theory of kin selection. Hamilton showed that animals such as workers could be expected to provide assistance to relatives such as their queens according to the costs and benefits involved (K) and their degree of genetic relatedness (r), and gave the rule that now carries his name, K &gt; 1/r. Early caution existed among researchers as to whether social insects could really assess their relatedness. Hamilton himself suggested an alternative possibility, namely that kin could become associated simply by &quot;population viscosity&quot; —that offspring tend not to disperse far from their birthplaces— and West-Eberhard (1969) found some evidence for this in &quot;Polistes&quot;. However, &quot;Polistes&quot; species are now known to learn and remember chemical signals (hydrocarbons) picked up from the nest to distinguish nestmates accurately from non-relatives.

===Dominance hierarchy system===
Morphologically, the foundress and subordinate reproductive members of the colony differ little. However, behavioral differentiation occurs among females both between and within generations. For example, in the species &quot;Polistes humilis&quot; the queen displays a &quot;tail-wagging&quot; behavior to assert her dominance over the worker class. Similarly, &quot;Polistes canadensis&quot; also possesses behavioral differentiation between the queen and her nestmates, with the queen often suppressing the aggressive behavior of subordinates through lateral abdominal vibrations and stroking. In contrast, unmated females are not aggressive. In &quot;Polistes exclamans&quot; queens have different amounts of glucose, fructose, and trehalose which lead to different cryoprotectant levels. This alters their survivability in different temperatures, increasing their odds of reproduction. Females in &quot;P. bellicosus&quot; are also morphologically similar between caste separations. For example, a &quot;P. bellicosus&quot; worker could become queen, and egg-layer, if all of the original foundresses die or leave the nest. This is also true for &quot;Polistes dorsalis&quot;, which also displays dominant behavior. Despite having no distinct morphological caste, roles of &quot;P. dorsalis&quot; tend to be fixed in a system with division of labor.

===Nestmate recognition===
&quot;Polistes&quot; spp. discriminate colony mates using an acquired (i.e. learned) cue, absorbing hydrocarbons from the natal nest at eclosion. This cuticular hydrocarbon &quot;signature&quot; is derived both from the plant material and the foundress-applied substances from which the nest is made. Studies of &quot;Polistes fuscatus&quot; have researched the molecular basis of the recognition &quot;pheromone&quot; used by the wasps, and indicate at least some of the recognizable labels have the same chemical constituents as the adult cuticular hydrocarbons. Similar recognition is found in &quot;Polistes metricus&quot;. 
Dominant individuals of &quot;P. dominula&quot; have differing cuticular profiles from workers, and the frequent observations of the dominant female stroking its gaster across the nest surface, combined with its staying on the nest for longer times than subordinates, suggests the dominant individual may contribute more to the nest odor.

&quot;P. carolina&quot; females do not preferentially feed their own progeny (as larvae).

Further to this recognition of nestmates, &quot;Polistes biglumis&quot; foundresses discriminate between &#x27;alien&#x27; eggs and their own via differential oophagy.

==Pest status==
Along with the German and common wasps, the Asian and Australian paper wasps (&quot;P. chinensis&quot; and &quot;P. humilis&quot;) are considered pests in New Zealand. Arriving in 1979, the Asian paper wasp has established itself in both the North Island and the northern parts of the South Island. Because it competes with native species (such as the kaka) for insects, nectar, and honeydew, it is a hindrance to conservation efforts.

In North America, the introduced European species &quot;Polistes dominula&quot; has rapidly colonized a significant area, and is considered an invasive pest. It is a concern for cherry and grape growers in British Columbia, as it injures the fruit by biting off the skin. It also spreads yeast and fungi that harm fruit and can be a nuisance to workers and pickers at harvest. There is evidence it has also displaced native paper wasp species by outcompeting them.

==Parasites==
Various other insects are parasites or parasitoids of &quot;Polistes&quot;, including flies (e.g., Sarcophagidae), mantispids, and wasps in the families Torymidae, Mutillidae (rarely), Braconidae, and Ichneumonidae (e.g. &quot;Latibulus argiolus&quot;). Some more specialized groups are more intimately associated with &quot;Polistes&quot;; this includes strepsipterans in the family Stylopidae (genus &quot;Xenos&quot;), wasps of the genus &quot;Elasmus&quot; (formerly placed in their own family, &quot;Elasmidae&quot;), and wasps in the family Trigonalidae.

The nests of many species of this wasp genus are invaded by the parasitoid caterpillars of the moth &quot;Chalcoela iphitalis&quot; which feed on the wasp larvae and pupas at night, spinning their cocoons in empty cells.

Within the subgenus &quot;Polistes&quot; are four known social obligate parasites: &quot;P. atrimandibularis&quot;, &quot;P. austroccidentalis&quot;, &quot;P. maroccanus&quot;, and &quot;P. semenowi&quot;, which parasitize other &quot;Polistes&quot; wasps. Known host species of these parasites are &quot;P. dominulus&quot;, &quot;P. gallicus&quot;, &quot;P. nimphus&quot;, &quot;P. associus&quot;, and &quot;P. biglumis&quot;. Although these parasites differ in their host invasion strategies, their end goal is to successfully infiltrate the host nest and reproduce at the host&#x27;s expense.

<text>Sunglass Hut is an international retailer of sunglasses and sunglass accessories founded in Miami, Florida, United States, in 1971. Sunglass Hut is part of the Italian-based Luxottica Group, the world’s largest eyewear company.

As of December 31, 2008, the Luxottica Group operated 2,286 stores around the world, most of those as part of the Sunglass Hut brand. By 2024 there were over 3,000 retail outlets under this brand name. 

Sunglass Hut stores are located in India, the United States, Mexico, Canada, the Caribbean, Brazil, continental Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa and the Middle East.

==History==
The first Sunglass Hut store opened in 1971 when optometrist Sanford L. Ziff set up in a freestanding kiosk in Miami&#x27;s Dadeland Mall. The success of this kiosk prompted Ziff to open other Sunglass Hut locations in Miami, and by 1986, Ziff had opened approximately 100 Sunglass Hut outlets, achieving sales of $24 million a year.

In 1986 Ziff sold a 75% stake in Sunglass Hut to Connecticut investment firm Kidd, Kamm &amp; Co. for $35 million. Ziff retained the company’s existing management team and shifted part ownership to his son, Dean. Following the partial acquisition, the business was incorporated under the name Sunglass Hut International, Inc.

Ziff retired from Sunglass Hut in 1989. He and his family retained a 25 percent stake in the business, but were no longer involved in its day-to-day operation. They retained the stake until 1991, when the company&#x27;s annual sales surpassed $100 million, and the Ziff family sold the portion of Sunglass Hut that remained in their control.

In 1993, Sunglass Hut International, Inc. became a public company, with an initial public offering of US$70-million, 

Sunglass Hut entered eCommerce when it added the ability to purchase sunglasses to its US website.

In February 2001, the Luxottica Group acquired Sunglass Hut, paying US$653 million including debt and taking possession of 1,300 Sunglass Hut stores, 430 Sunglass Hut-Watch Station combination stores, and 228 stores that operated under either the Watch Station or Watch World banner.

Under Luxottica&#x27;s control, Sunglass Hut repositioned its brand identity to emphasize the fashion of the sunglasses it sold. The repositioning began in 2003.

The Watch Station International chain was sold to Fossil Inc. in December 2007.

==Stores and locations==


Sunglass Hut operates 2,000 retail outlets in 20 countries: 1,562 in North America, 157 in Australia, 44 in New Zealand, 15 in Asia, 123 in South Africa, 81 in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 33 in the Middle East, and 35 in India. , it is the most common store in American shopping malls.

Sunglass Hut store types include normal retail stores and shopping centre kiosks, retailers in airports, hotels and outlet centres, and premium &quot;global&quot; stores. Sunglass Hut has entered into a partnership with Macy’s to open stores within their department stores.

Sunglass Hut stores have opened in Australia, China, Thailand, Lebanon, India, the United Arab Emirates, Czech Republic, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In 2011, they continued to grow within Central and South America, opening up stores in Mexico and Brazil.

<text>King and Queen of the Ring, formerly and still commonly known as simply King of the Ring, is a professional wrestling event produced by WWE, a Connecticut-based professional wrestling promotion. The event was established in 1993 and centers on the men&#x27;s King of the Ring tournament, which had been established in 1985, and beginning in 2024, the women&#x27;s Queen of the Ring tournament, which was established in 2021 and originally known as the Queen&#x27;s Crown tournament.

The King of the Ring event was originally established in 1993 and was held annually in June as a pay-per-view (PPV) event. During the event&#x27;s original run as a PPV, it was considered one of the promotion&#x27;s five biggest events of the year, along with the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the &quot;Big Five&quot;. The 2002 event was the final King of the Ring produced as a PPV. To coincide with the brand extension introduced earlier that same year, the 2002 event featured wrestlers from both the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. In 2003, the event&#x27;s PPV slot was replaced by Bad Blood.

The tournament endured a four-year hiatus until its return in 2006 as an exclusive tournament for wrestlers of the SmackDown brand. Instead of a dedicated PPV, however, this tournament concluded at that year&#x27;s Judgment Day. While subsequent tournaments were periodically held as a non-PPV event and included WWE&#x27;s other brands, the conclusion to the 2015 tournament was livestreamed exclusively as an event on the WWE Network and also occurred when a brand extension was not in effect; the brand split was then reintroduced in 2016. While the tournaments continued to be held periodically, the event itself was to be revived in May 2023 and rebranded as &quot;King and Queen of the Ring&quot; to incorporate the women&#x27;s tournament; however, these plans were scrapped as WWE instead held a revived Night of Champions. The rebranded &quot;King and Queen of the Ring&quot; event that was intended for 2023 was rescheduled for May 2024 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This will be the first King of the Ring event since 2015, the first to air on traditional PPV since 2002, the first held outside of the United States, as well as the first dedicated event for the women&#x27;s tournament, which was renamed to Queen of the Ring for its 2024 return.

== History ==
The King of the Ring tournament is a men&#x27;s single-elimination tournament in which the winner is crowned the &quot;King of the Ring&quot;. The tournament was established in 1985 by the then-World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was held annually until 1991, with the exception of 1990. These early tournaments were held as special non-televised house shows in an effort to boost attendance at these events.

In 1993, the WWF began to produce an annual June pay-per-view (PPV) event titled King of the Ring. The inaugural PPV took place on June 13, 1993, at the Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio. Unlike the previous non-televised events, the PPV did not feature all of the tournament&#x27;s matches. Instead, several of the qualifying matches preceded the event with the final few matches then taking place at the pay-per-view. There were also other matches that took place at the event as it was a traditional three-hour pay-per-view. The King of the Ring event was considered one of the promotion&#x27;s &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs of the year, along with the Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, up until its disestablishment after the 2002 event—it was the only event of the five to never be hosted at least once at Madison Square Garden. In 2003, the event&#x27;s PPV slot was replaced by Bad Blood. 

In early 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) following a lawsuit from the World Wildlife Fund over the &quot;WWF&quot; initialism. Also around this time, the promotion introduced the brand extension, in which the roster was divided between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. The 2002 tournament and PPV was in turn held for wrestlers from both brands.

After a four-year hiatus, the tournament returned in 2006 and was held exclusively for wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand. Unlike the previous years, however, there was not an associated pay-per-view. Instead, tournament matches took place across episodes of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with the finale being held at Judgment Day. While WWE continued to periodically hold the tournament across their other programs, the semifinals and final of the 2015 tournament aired exclusively as an event on WWE&#x27;s online streaming service, the WWE Network, which launched in February 2014. This 2015 tournament also occurred when the brand extension was not in effect; the brand split was reinstated in 2016.

In October 2022, Dave Meltzer of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; reported that WWE was planning to resurrect the King of the Ring event in 2023 to replace the Hell in a Cell event. This was officially confirmed by WWE on March 6, 2023, with the company announcing that the event would be rebranded as &quot;King and Queen of the Ring&quot; to incorporate the women&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Crown tournament that was established in 2021. This would have seen the event&#x27;s return to PPV, in addition to airing on WWE&#x27;s livestreaming platforms. It was scheduled for May 27, 2023, and would have been the ninth event that WWE held in Saudi Arabia in support of Saudi Vision 2030. However, on April 13, it was revealed that WWE decided to scrap the revival and would instead hold Night of Champions, thus reviving the Night of Champions event. According to Mike Johnson of &quot;PWInsider&quot;, the decision to change the event to Night of Champions was a creative choice to revive and bring that event to an international market. &quot;Fightful&quot; later reported that WWE did not have plans to reschedule King and Queen of the Ring for later that year, but the event could possibly be used for a future Saudi show. In April 2024, WWE announced that they would hold the King and Queen of the Ring event in Saudi Arabia in May 2024, thus being the 11th event in the Saudi Arabian partnership. The women&#x27;s tournament was also renamed as Queen of the Ring, with this also being the first dedicated event for the women&#x27;s tournament.

<text>Saint Theosebia ( &quot;Theosebeia&quot;), also known as Theosebia the Deaconess, was a 4th-century Christian leader, who is honored as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Catholic Church, she is referred to as Blessed Theosebia the Deaconess.

==Life==
Much mystery surrounds the life of Theosebia. Her year of birth is unknown and her death date uncertain, though probably subsequent to 381. However, she is thought to have played an important role in the church in Nyssa, where she was a deaconess.

Gregory Nazianzen wrote a letter of condolence on her death to Gregory of Nyssa in which Gregory Nazianzen mentioned &quot;your sister Theosebia&quot; and &quot;true yoke-fellow of a priest&quot;. This has caused some debate regarding the ambiguous manner in which she is identified. Some historians supposed Theosebia was the wife of Gregory of Nyssa, others suppose she was one of his sisters like Macrina the Younger. If so, then Theosebia was the sister of Basil the Great as well.

Gregory of Nyssa — unlike the other Cappadocian Fathers — was married, according to his own testimony in his work &quot;On Virginity&quot; that he could not benefit from the subject of his own work. This, combined with Nazianzen&#x27;s statement that Theosebia was buried by the other Gregory in the aforementioned letter, suggest that she was either Gregory of Nyssa&#x27;s wife or sister, whose funeral he would have been obliged to oversee.

The Cappadocian Gregory of Nazianzus wrote to Gregory of Nyssa about Theosebia, “the pride of the church, the ornament of Christ, the finest of our generation, the free speech of women, Theosebia, the most illustrious among the brethren, outstanding in beauty of soul. Theosebia, truly a priestly personage, the colleague of a priest, equally honored and worthy of the great sacraments.&quot;

==Legacy==

The St Theosevia Centre for Christian Spirituality is in Oxford, although using an alternate spelling, is named after Theosebia. Donald Allchin was director of the centre from 1987 to 1994.

<text>OPSM (Optical Prescription Spectacle Makers) is a retailer of eye glasses in Australia and New Zealand, with locations in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia. It is owned by EssilorLuxottica, a French-Italian eyewear conglomerate.

OPSM&#x27;s CEO since October 2020 is Matteo Accornero.

==History==
OPSM was founded in Sydney in 1932, and was floated on the Australian Securities Exchange in 1962. In May 2001, OPSM sold its Protector Safety Supply Group to Howard Smith. Luxottica acquired a controlling interest in 2003 and in February 2005, OPSM was delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange.

In 2010, OPSM opened the Eye Hub concept store in the Melbourne suburb of Hawthorn, blending optometry and ophthalmology into one practice. As to 2018, it operated 330 stores and 41 franchises.

==Laubman &amp; Pank==
Laubman &amp; Pank became at one stage the largest eye care business in Australia. It began operations in 1908 with two optometrists deciding to set up their own business. The group was acquired by OPSM in 2001 and is now run by Luxottica, the world&#x27;s biggest eye care and eye wear conglomerate. Laubman &amp; Pank has 38 stores in Australia.

==Hong Kong==

OPSM acquired The Optical Centre () from Michael Miu in 2002. At that time OPSM also owned another Hong Kong–based chain (known in Chinese under the brand ). Nowadays Luxottica group runs the Hong Kong chain under dual-brand LensCrafters . It also used the brand Sunglass Hut.

<text>Wilhelm von Kaulbach (15 October 18057 April 1874) was a German painter, noted mainly as a muralist, but also as a book illustrator. His murals decorate buildings in Munich. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.

==Biography==

===Education===
He was born in Bad Arolsen, Waldeck. His father combined painting and engraving with the goldsmith&#x27;s trade. The family was so poor that he and his sister were glad to accept even stale bread from the peasantry in exchange for the father&#x27;s engravings. This is said to have suggested to him his earliest work, &quot;The Fall of Manna in the Wilderness&quot;. But means were found to place Wilhelm, a youth of seventeen, in the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, to which the sculptor Rauch had obtained him admission. The academy was then becoming renowned under the directorship of Peter von Cornelius, of whom he became a distinguished pupil. Young Kaulbach contended against hardships, even hunger. But his courage never failed and, uniting genius with industry, he was soon foremost among the young national party which sought to revive the arts of Germany.

===Munich murals===
The ambitious work by which Ludwig I of Bavaria sought to transform Munich into a German Athens afforded the young painter an appropriate sphere. Cornelius had been commissioned to execute the enormous frescoes in the Glyptothek, and his custom was in the winters, with the aid of Kaulbach and others, to complete the cartoons at Düsseldorf, and in the summers, accompanied by his best pupils, to carry out the designs in colour on the museum walls in Munich. In 1824 Cornelius became director of the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. Kaulbach, not yet twenty, followed, took up his permanent residence in Munich, worked hard on the public works, executed independent commissions, and in 1849, when Cornelius left for Berlin, succeeded to the directorship of the academy, an office which he held till his death.

Kaulbach matured, after the example of the masters of the Middle Ages, the practice of mural or monumental decoration; he once more conjoined painting with architecture, and displayed a creative fertility and readiness of resource scarcely found since the era of Raphael and Michelangelo. Under the direction of Cornelius, he designed (1825–1828) many frescoes for the new buildings at Munich, including &quot;Apollo and the Muses&quot;, for the ceiling of the Odeon; designs from Klopstock&#x27;s Battle of Hermann&quot;, and from Goethe&#x27;s and Wieland&#x27;s poems, for the royal palace; purely classical illustrations of the story of Amor and Psyche, for the palace of Duke Max; and many allegorical figures for the arcades of the palace garden.

Early in the series of his multitudinous works came the famous &quot;Narrenhaus&quot;, the appalling memories of a certain madhouse near Düsseldorf; the composition all the more deserves mention for points of contact with Hogarth. Somewhat to the same category belong the illustrations to &quot;Reineke Fuchs&quot;. After &quot;Narrenhaus&quot;, his next great work, the &quot;Battle of the Huns&quot;, or &quot;Spectre Battle&quot;, representing the legend of the continued combat in mid-air between the spirits of the Huns and of Romans who had fallen before the walls of Rome, exhibited on the largest scale his talent for the symbolical and allegorical. Count Raczynski commissioned him to paint the work in sepia, and he finished it in 1837. The king of Saxony now offered him the direction of the academy of Dresden, with a salary of 2,000 thalers; but Kaulbach preferred to remain in Munich, although he received only 800 florins from the king of Bavaria.

These works, together with occasional figures or passages in complex pictorial dramas, show how dominant and irrepressible were the artists sense of satire and enjoyment of fun; character in its breadth and sharpness is depicted with keenest relish, and at times the sardonic smile bursts into the loudest laugh. Thus occasionally the grotesque degenerates into the vulgar, the grand into the ridiculous, as in the satire on &quot;The Pigtail Age&quot;, a fresco outside the New Pinakothek. Yet these exceptional extravagances came not of weakness but from excess of power. Kaulbach tried hard to become Grecian and Italian; but he never reached Phidias or Raphael; in short the blood of Dürer, Holbein and Martin Schöngauer ran strong in his veins. The art products in Munich during the middle of the 19th century were of a quantity to preclude first-rate quality, and Kaulbach contracted a fatal facility in covering wall and canvas by the acre.

===History of Mankind===
Having hitherto worked almost exclusively in fresco, he spent some time in Venice and a year in Rome to prepare himself for painting the cartoon in oil for the new Pinakothek, completing it in 1846. About the same time he commenced his famous designs illustrative of the history of mankind for the Neues Museum at Berlin, which were executed by his pupils and completed in 1860. They consist of six frescoes, representing &quot;The Tower of Babel&quot;, &quot;Homer and the Greeks&quot;, &quot;The Destruction of Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;The Battle of the Huns&quot; (—a painting that inspired the 1857 symphonic poem &quot;Hunnenschlacht&quot; by Liszt), &quot;The Crusaders at the gates of Jerusalem&quot;, and &quot;The Age of the Reformation&quot;. &quot; The Destruction of Jerusalem&quot; was a copy of an earlier oil painting, much admired by Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, which was by then already in the collection of Ludwig I of Bavaria.

These major tableaux, severally 30 feet long, and each comprising over one hundred figures above life-size, were surrounded by minor compositions making more than twenty in all. The idea was to congregate around the world&#x27;s historic dramas the prime agents of civilization; thus here were assembled allegoric figures of Architecture and other arts, of Science and other kingdoms of knowledge, together with lawgivers from the time of Moses, not forgetting Frederick the Great. The chosen situation for this imposing didactic and theatric display was the Treppenhaus or grand staircase in the Neues Museum, Berlin; the surface was a granulated, absorbent wall, specially prepared; the technical method was that known as &quot;water-glass,&quot; or &quot;liquid flint,&quot; the infusion of silica securing permanence. The same medium was adopted in the later murals in the Palace of Westminster. The staircase was severely damaged during the Second World War, and only traces of Kaulbach&#x27;s work remain.

His perspicuous and showy manner also gained him abundant occupation as a book illustrator. Among his engraved designs are the Shakespeare gallery, the Goethe gallery and a folio edition of the Gospels. With regard to these examples of the Munich school, it was asserted that Kaulbach had been unfortunate alike in having found Cornelius for a master and King Ludwig for a patron, that he attempted subjects far beyond him, believing that his admiration for them was the same as inspiration; and supplied the lack of real imagination by a compound of intellect and fancy. Nevertheless, in such compositions as the &quot;Destruction of Jerusalem&quot; and the &quot;Battle of the Huns&quot;, Kaulbach shows creative imagination. As a dramatic poet he tells the story, depicts character, seizes on action and situation, and thus as it were takes the spectator by storm. The manner may be occasionally noisy and ranting, but the effect after its kind is tremendous. The cartoon, which, as usual in German art of the time, is superior to the ultimate picture, was executed in the artist&#x27;s prime at the age of thirty. At this period, as here seen, the knowledge was little short of absolute; subtle is the sense of beauty; playful, delicate, firm the touch; the whole treatment artistic.

===Late work===
The painter&#x27;s last period brings no new departure; his ultimate works stand conspicuous by exaggerations of early characteristics. The series of designs illustrative of Goethe, which had an immense success, were melodramatic and pandered to popular taste. The vast canvas, more than 30 ft. long, the &quot;Sea Fight at Salamis&quot;, painted for the 
Maximilianeum, Munich, evinces wonted imagination and facility in composition; the handling also retains its largeness and vigour; but in this astounding scenic uproar moderation and the simplicity of nature are thrown to the winds, and the whole atmosphere is hot and feverish.

His fervent Protestantism – which alienated him in the latter part of his life from Cornelius, who was as decided a Catholic – is most strongly expressed in his &quot;Don Pedro de Arbuez, the Inquisitor&quot;, which, appearing at the time of the ecumenical council (1869-70), produced a great sensation, and gave rise to many 
controversies. Shortly hefore his death he was at work upon a large cartoon of &quot;The Deluge&quot;; and he had finished his &quot;St. Michael, the Patron Saint of Germany&quot;, in the garb of a heavenly messenger with a radiant air of triumph, and with Napoleon III and his son and several Jesuits cowering at his feet.

A trace has shown that he lived at &quot;Obere Garten Gasse 16½&quot; in Munich around 1850. Kaulbach was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1870. He died on 7 April 1874 in Munich and is buried there in the Alter Südfriedhof. His son Hermann (1846–1909) also became a distinguished painter.

==Style==
Kaulbach&#x27;s style was eclectic; in the &quot;Age of Homer&quot; the types and the treatment are derived from Greek marbles and vases; then in the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; the severity of the antique gives place to the suavity of the Italian Renaissance; while in the &quot;Crusades&quot; the composition is let loose into modern Romanticism, and so the manner descends into the midst of the 20th century. And yet this scholastically compounded art is so nicely adjusted and smoothly blended that it casts off all incongruity and becomes homogeneous as the issue of one mind. But the public craved change; and so in later years Kaulbach&#x27;s popularity declined, and he had to witness, not without inquietude, the rise of an opposing party of naturalism and realism. He is perhaps best known for his unusual representation of death, destruction and madness.

<doc id="531990" wikidata="Q696994" url="?curid=531990" title="Yangban">
<text>The yangban () were part of the traditional ruling class or gentry of dynastic Korea during the Joseon period. The &quot;yangban&quot; were mainly composed of highly educated civil officials and military officers—landed or unlanded aristocrats who individually exemplified the Korean Confucian form of a &quot;scholarly official&quot;. They were largely government administrators and bureaucrats who oversaw medieval and early modern Korea&#x27;s traditional agrarian bureaucracy until the end of the dynasty in 1897. In a broader sense, an office holder&#x27;s family and descendants, as well as country families who claimed such descent, were socially accepted as &quot;yangban&quot;.

In contemporary Korean language, the term &quot;yangban&quot; can be used either as a compliment or insult.

==Etymology==
&quot;Yangban&quot; literally means &quot;two branches&quot; of administration: &quot;munban&quot; () which comprises civil administrators and &quot;muban&quot; () which comprises martial office holders. The term yangban first appeared sometime during late Goryeo but gained wider usage during the Joseon period. However, from the sixteenth century onward &quot;yangban&quot; increasingly came to denote local wealthy families who were mostly believed to be the descendants of once high-ranking officials. As more of the population aspired to become &quot;yangban&quot; and gradually succeeded in doing so in the late Joseon period by purchasing the &quot;yangban&quot; status, the privileges and splendor the term had inspired slowly vanished. It even gained a diminutive connotation.
==Overview==
Unlike noble titles in the European and Japanese aristocracies, which were conferred on a hereditary basis, the bureaucratic position of &quot;yangban&quot; was granted by law to &quot;yangban&quot; who meritoriously passed state-sponsored civil service exams called &quot;gwageo&quot; (). This exam was modeled on the imperial examinations first started during the Goryeo dynasty of Korea. Upon passing these exams—which tested knowledge of the Confucian classics and history with poetry—several times, &quot;yangban&quot; was usually assigned to a government post. It was superficially decided that a &quot;yangban&quot; family that did not produce a government official for more than three generations could lose its status and become commoners. This superficial rule was never actually applied, but was a motivation rule for &quot;yangban&quot; to study harder. In theory, a member of any social class except nobi, baekjeong (Korean untouchables), and children of concubines could take the government exams and become a &quot;yangban&quot;. In reality, only the upper classes—i.e., the children of &quot;yangban&quot;—possessed the financial resources and the wherewithal to pass the exams, for which years of studying were required. These barriers and financial constraints effectively excluded most non-&quot;yangban&quot; families and the lower classes from competing for &quot;yangban&quot; status, just like scholar-officials in China.

&quot;Yangban&quot; status on a provincial level was &quot;de facto&quot; hereditary. In the early Joseon Dynasty, if no one from a noble family had held a government position for four generations, they were deprived of that position.  However, the government, which was short of budget due to the wars of the 16th century and the disasters caused by the Little Ice Age, issued a tool called Gongmyeongcheop, a means of purchasing and selling government positions, and the existing caste system collapsed.  As a result, genealogy, rather than official position, became a means of proving one&#x27;s status as a nobleman, and the status of Yangban changed to a hereditary form. It was customary to include all descendants of the office holders in the hyangan (), a document that listed the names and lineages of local &quot;yangban&quot; families. The &quot;hyangan&quot; was maintained on blood basis, and one could be cut off from it if members of the family married social inferiors, such as tradesmen. Although the &quot;hyangan&quot; was not legally supported by government acts or statutes, the families listed in it were socially respected as &quot;yangban&quot;. Their householders had the customary right to participate in the hyangso (), a local council from which they could exercise influence on local politics and administration. By reserving and demanding socio-political power through local instruments such as &quot;hyangan&quot; and &quot;hyangso&quot;, &quot;yangban&quot; automatically passed down their status to posterity in local magnate families, with or without holding central offices. These provincial families of gentility were often termed &quot;jaejisajok&quot; (), which means &quot;the country families&quot;. while legally, &quot;yangban&quot; meant high-ranking officials, in reality it included almost all descendants of the former and increasingly lost its legal exactitude.
Throughout Joseon history, the monarchy and the &quot;yangban&quot; existed on the slave labor of the lower classes, particularly the sangmin, whose bondage to the land as indentured servants enabled the upper classes to enjoy a perpetual life of leisure—i.e., the life of &quot;scholarly&quot; gentlemen. These practices effectively ended in 1894 during the Korean Empire of Gwangmu Reform.

In today&#x27;s Korea, the &quot;yangban&quot; legacy of patronage based on common educational experiences, teachers, family backgrounds, and hometowns continues in some forms, officially and unofficially. In South Korea, the practice exists among the upper class and power elite, where patronage among the conglomerates tends to predictably follow blood, school, and hometown ties. In North Korea, a &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;yangban&quot; class exists that is based mostly on military and party alliances.

== History ==
&quot;Yangban&quot; were the Joseon period equivalent of the former Goryeo nobles who had been educated in Buddhist and Confucian studies. With the succession of the Yi generals in the Joseon dynasty, prior feuds and factions were quelled through a decisive attempt to instill administrative organization throughout Korea and create a new class of agrarian bureaucrats. The individual &quot;yangban&quot; included members of this new class of bureaucrats and former Goryeo nobility. While ostensibly open to all, the civil service exams catered to the lifestyle and habits of the &quot;yangban&quot;, which created a semi-hereditary meritocracy, as &quot;yangban&quot; families overwhelmingly possessed the minimum education, uninterrupted study time and immense financial resources to pass such exams. The yangban, like the Mandarins before them, dominated the Royal Court and military of pre-Modern Korea and often were exempt from laws including those relating to taxes.

There were at most 100 positions open with thousands of candidates taking the exams. Competition that was originally supposed to bring out the best in each candidate gave way to the importance of familial relationships. Because the Joseon Court was constantly divided among the Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western faction members (the eccentric geographical naming derived from the location of each leader&#x27;s house in Seoul which was divided into subsections), a divided system resulted where corruption was very difficult. With each faction constantly probing for an excuse to kill off the other, if one faction was proven to be corrupt then the other factions would immediately jump on the chance to purge them. The attempt to receive or give bribes on a massive scale was suicide. It wasn&#x27;t until the reign of King Sunjo that the Kim clan of Andong in cooperation with few other blood-related grandee clans obtained full control over the court — after purging their rival factions and other rival clans in their own political faction the Joseon bureaucracy degenerated into corruption. At this level the exceptionally powerful families could be more properly referred to as &quot;sedoga&quot; () instead of mere &quot;yangban&quot;, which by then came to include shades of classes other than the grandees.

From the sixteenth century and increasingly during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, high-ranking offices were monopolized by a few grandee families based in Seoul or the Han River Valley, therefore blocking any chance of gaining high-ranking posts by many provincial families of pedigree. However, provincial magnates began to refer to themselves as &quot;yangban&quot; whether they held government offices or not. As more families claimed to be &quot;yangban&quot; and exercised provincial influences through local institutions the term lost its original meaning and became a sort of social status with a confusing legal standing. Its economic and cultural domain was clear, though. A landlord who studied classics at a &quot;seowon&quot; could be easily looked upon as &quot;yangban&quot; by the local populace. People could now purchase &quot;yangban&quot; status by paying for a procuration for a lower government post or a &quot;jokbo&quot;, the noble pedigree.

Nearly all &quot;yangban&quot; of upper-high ranking grandee to lower-ranking provincial landlord status suddenly lost their ancient political, social, and economic power during the twentieth century. The legality of &quot;yangban&quot; was abolished in 1894. Subsequently, their political and administrative role was replaced by the Japanese colonial government and its administrators, although some &quot;yangban&quot; maintained their wealth and power by cooperating with the Japanese. However, the erosion of the idea of complete and exclusive power was irreversible. During the period of Japanese colonial rule, the privileged yangban class, comprising largely those who did not actively resist Japan because of the pro-Japanese policies, gained advantages. They ventured into various industries such as printing, textiles, rubber, clothing, and brewing. Accumulating wealth, they expanded their ventures into sectors requiring technological expertise, including machinery, chemicals, automobiles, and shipbuilding. These individuals were less affected by Japanese policies and sometimes even benefited from them, allowing them to accumulate more wealth than other social strata. However, they did not receive the same treatment as the Japanese aristocracy under Japanese rule. There were limitations as both social classes and businesses remained dependent on Japan, and the profits flowed back to the Japanese upper class. Unlike popular narratives in Korean minjung scholarship, after the outbreak of the Korean War, the influence of the Yangban class and discrimination against the common people persisted.

In modern-day Korea, the &quot;yangban&quot; as a social class with legal status and landed wealth no longer exists either in the north or the south. Nevertheless, those who are well-connected in Korean society are sometimes said to have &quot;yangban&quot; connections. Though these claims may have some merit, such references are not usually intended to suggest any real &quot;yangban&quot; lineage or ancestry. Today, the &quot;yangban&quot; have been replaced by the Korean ruling class, i.e., an elite class of business and government elites, who dominate the country through their wealth, power and influence channeled through their familial and social networks. (This applies to North and South Korea, though the North&#x27;s elite class is largely military-based.) The word is also used, at least in South Korea, as a common reference (sometimes with distinctly negative connotations, reflecting the negative impression the class system and its abuses left on Koreans as a whole) to an older, sometimes cantankerous or stubborn man. Some descendants of Yangban families still maintain a formidable presence thanks to the remnants of their superiority and vestiges of privilege, standing significantly above the common populace.

== Fashion ==
During the Joseon Dynasty, men&#x27;s clothing varied in form depending on their social status, occupation, and circumstances. Generally, men wore &quot;jeogori&quot; (jackets), &quot;baji&quot; (pants), and &quot;po&quot; (outer garments) as basic attire. Commoners and lower-class individuals typically wore simple garments made of plain-colored cotton or hemp, while the upper class, such as the Yangban, utilized luxurious materials and colors. The attire of the Yangban class featured intricate details, materials, and accompanying accessories which reflected the wearer&#x27;s societal status. Each attire differed based on their jobs and titles, their attire was also a reflection of the respect to be given to them and their family lineage. The Hanbok of Yangban is beyond the general hanbok style and is known as &quot;po&quot; (). &quot;Po&quot; has multiple variations but the most popular is known as &quot;dopo&quot; (), a long gown with an additional section that covers the lower back and features a slit that gives wavy design. Layering was also a feature of Yangban Hanbok based on the weather or season and was often colorful.

Their hair was tied into an up-top bun and the temple was daunted with a band known as 망건 (&quot;mang-geon&quot;), which had a stone known as 풍잠 (&quot;pung-jam&quot;) in the middle that covered the bun to symbolize uniformity. The top bun was in egg shape and used a hairpin known as 빈녀 (&quot;binyeo&quot;) to maintain its structure. The tightness with which 망건 (&quot;mang-geon&quot;) is tied was associated with the level of fashion a Yangban was knowledgeable in. 망건 Mang-geon is tied to a button-like stone on the either sides near the ears known as 관자 (&quot;kwan–ja&quot;). These &quot;kwan–ja&quot; played the role of assessing a Yangban&#x27;s rank based on the material and size of it. For example, a big golden &quot;kwan–ja&quot; meant the person belonged to higher class.

Another feature are the accessories. Earrings were worn by Yangban from the early Joseon dynasty and by people of all ages up until the 14th Joseon King, San-Jo, banned wearing earrings due to the discrimination by other countries during war. Similar to the modern day watch, an accessory of Yangban that was always seen in their hands was a hand fan known as 부채 (&quot;bu-chae&quot;), of which many different types and designs symbolized rank and various other elements of social hierarchy.

Hats were also a huge part of Yangban fashion. Hats known as 갓 (&quot;gat&quot;), shaped in a round and big cylindrical top that covered their hair, featured a brooch on the top known as 정자 (&quot;jung-ja&quot;). The hat also featured some fashionable elements such as string with beads and elements depended on the wearer&#x27;s personal preference and hierarchical rank. In the royal family, the number of strings on a hat adorned by the king or prince determined their ranks.

Shoes worn by Yangban were of two kinds low-ankle shoes known as &quot;hye&quot; () and high-cut shoes known as &quot;hwa&quot; (). These two were strictly worn by the elite class. Footwear was also divided based on the material. For example, Commoners wore wooden clogs or straw shoes daily whereas Yangban and royal families wore leather shoes known as 갓신 (&quot;gatsin&quot;) with beautiful patterns and colors.

While exploring the fashion of the Yangban class during the Joseon Dynasty, it reveals that their attire was more than just a question of personal preference, but a reflection of complex society systems and beliefs profoundly rooted in Confucian ideas.

As highlighted by Lee Youngjae, the portrayal of Hanbok in Shin Yun-Bok&#x27;s paintings offers invaluable insights into the attire of the ruling-class during this period. These garments, detailed in vivid colors and luxurious fabrics, symbolized not only the wearer&#x27;s social standing but also adherence to Confucian ideals. Yi et al. (2007) further emphasizes the significance of traditional Korean outfit, demonstrating how apparel acted as a visible depiction of one&#x27;s social status, with minor distinctions designating rank and connection.

The colorful garments were exclusive to the Yangban class. From an economic standpoint, red was a highly luxurious item during the Joseon Dynasty. To dye a single set of deep red clothing required the cultivation of madder plants (), and it took as much farmland to grow these plants as would yield enough grain to feed a family of four for a month. Furthermore, fabric dyed in a rich red hue costs more than four times the value of white cloth. Consequently, commoners dared not even contemplate using deep red colors.

<text>Pyongyang International Airport () , also known as Pyongyang Sunan International Airport (), is the sole international airport serving Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea and located in the city&#x27;s Sunan District. 

==History==
===Early years===
During the period of Japanese rule, two airports were built in Pyongyang. Pyongyang Air Base was built by the Empire of Japan in the 1940s and remained in use until the 1950s. A second airport, Mirim Airport, was also built by the forces of the empire of Japan in the 1940s, east of the Taedong River. However, after World War II there was a need for a newer airport, and Sunan Airfield was built. Mirim Airport survived as a military airfield, and Pyongyang Air Base was re-developed for government use and for housing.

During the Korean War, the airport was occupied by United Nations forces for seven weeks in late 1950, when the forces flew large amounts of supplies to Sunan. On 13 May 1953, the airport was inundated when the United States Air Force bombed Toksan Dam. After an armistice was signed, two months later, the North Korean Government began repairing and expanding the airport.

The Soviet airline Aeroflot flew to Moscow and Khabarovsk in the 1980s. In the 1990s, Air Koryo also provided nonstop flights to Moscow, which continued on to Berlin and Sofia.

During the 1989 13th World Festival of Youth and Students held in Pyongyang, a temporary terminal building was erected specifically to accommodate the arrival of the festival’s international attendees.

===Development since the 2000s===
Russian Sky Airlines operated charter services to Pyongyang from Russian destinations in the mid-2000s on Il-62M and Il-86 aircraft. China Southern Airlines offered scheduled charter flights to and from Beijing during the peak season only, and permanently stopped its flights in October 2006. In March 2008, Air China re-established service to Beijing on a Boeing 737, three days a week, and suspended due to lack of demand on 22 November 2017. Air Koryo, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines also provided chartered flight services to Seoul and Yangyang, on the east coast of South Korea, from Pyongyang. These flights were used by Koreans visiting relatives across the border; these services were halted after the ending of the Sunshine Policy by South Korea in 2008. In June 2018, Air China resumed service from Beijing Capital Airport to Pyongyang.

By early 2011, an interim facility handling international flights had been built just south of the existing terminal. By early 2012, demolition of the existing terminal, which Kim Jong-un deemed too small and outdated, had begun. In July 2012, he ordered the construction of a new terminal. Besides this, a new control tower and VIP terminal north of the main terminal were also built. The project became part of a &quot;speed campaign&quot;, in which thousands of workers were enlisted to complete it quickly. On 15 September 2017, about 6:30am KST, North Korea fired a Hwasong-12 missile from the airport. The missile travelled 3,700 kilometers (2,300 mi) and reached a maximum height of 770 kilometers (480 mi).

The airport was closed to international travel in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and reopened in 2023 with the resumption of Air Koryo flights to Beijing and Vladivostok.

==Infrastructure==

===Terminals===
Pyongyang International Airport has two passenger terminals. Terminal 1 opened in January 2016 and handles domestic flights only. It is connected to Terminal 2, the international terminal, which was inaugurated on 1 July 2015. Terminal 2 has jet bridges and at least 12 check-in counters. Amenities include a duty-free store, coffee bar, newsstand and Internet room, along with a snack bar, a pharmacy, a CD/DVD shop, and an electronics shop. There is also a business-class lounge with a buffet on the upper level, along with an outdoor viewing area. During the construction period, a hangar-like structure served the airport with basic services (baggage carousel), a duty-free shop, and a bookshop/souvenir shop.

===Runways===
The airport has two functioning runways: one is designated 17/35 and measures , while the other, designated 01/19, measures .

===Maintenance===
Yonhap reported in September 2016 that a maintenance facility had been built at the Pyongyang airport. About from runway 17/35, the facility includes aircraft hangars and apartment buildings for high-ranking officials and Air Koryo employees.

==Airlines and destinations==

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On February 16, 1958, a Douglas DC-3 of Korean National Airlines was hijacked on a flight from Busan to Seoul by 8 hijackers demanding to be taken to North Korea and landed here. All 34 occupants survived.

* On March 31, 1970, a Boeing 727-89 of JAL (JA8315) was hijacked on a flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka by 9 hijackers demanding to be taken to North Korea and landed here. All 115 occupants survived.

* On August 15, 2006, a Tupolev Tu-154B-2 of Air Koryo (possibly P-561) suffered minor damage in a non-fatal runway mishap on landing from Beijing and was later repaired.

==Ground transportation==
The airport is about from the city, about 30 minutes&#x27; drive by the Pyongyang-Hicheon Expressway. In addition, Sunan Station, on the Pyongui Line of the Korean State Railway, is from the Pyongyang airport terminal building.

<text>HMAS &quot;Shoalwater&quot; (M 81), named for Shoalwater Bay in Queensland, was a Bay class minehunter of the Royal Australian Navy.

She was built by Carrington Slipways at its Ramsay Fibreglass facility in Tomago, New South Wales, launched on 20 June 1987 and commissioned on 10 October 1987. During her sea trials, &quot;Shoalwater&quot; travelled to Townsville where a number of charges were detonated around the vessel to test her tolerance to underwater explosions. &quot;Shoalwater&quot; performed above expectations during these tests. For the duration of her service with the RAN, &quot;Shoalwater&quot; was assigned to HMAS Waterhen in Sydney, where the Navy established a Mine Warfare Systems Centre ahead of the Bay class ships entering service.

&quot;Shoalwater&quot; was decommissioned on 14 August 2001. She and sister ship were sold in 2002 for service in the Persian Gulf.

<text>HMAS &quot;Snipe&quot; (M1102) (formerly HMS &quot;Alcaston&quot;) was a which served in the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Construction==
The ship was constructed by John I. Thornycroft and Company at Southampton and launched on 4 September 1952.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===
The ship was completed on 16 December 1952, and commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Alcaston&quot;, being allocated the pennant number M.1102. &quot;Alcaston&quot; served with the 104th Mine Sweeping Squadron, and in November 1956 took part in Operation Musketeer, the Anglo-French attack on the Suez Canal. In 1961 she was sold to Australia along with five other Ton-class minesweepers.

===Australia===
Following her sale, the ship was refitted with her engines replaced by Napier Deltic diesel engines, stabilisers being fitted and air conditioning added to better suit the ship for Australian service. The ship recommissioned as HMAS &quot;Snipe&quot; on 11 September 1962.

In September 1963, &quot;Snipe&quot; took part in Operation &quot;Gardening&quot;, a large scale operation by Australian minesweepers to clear magnetic mines laid during the Second World War in the approaches to Tonolei harbour, Bouganville. On 10 February 1964, the aircraft carrier and destroyer collided, sinking &quot;Voyager&quot;. &quot;Snipe&quot; took part in search for survivors from &quot;Voyager&quot;. During the mid-1960s, &quot;Snipe&quot; was one of several ships operating in support of the Malaysian government during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. This service was later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot;. Her first tour took place between May 1964 and January 1965, with a second tour lasting from September 1965 to August 1966. On 16 December that year, &quot;Snipe&quot; was paid off into reserve.

&quot;Snipe&quot; remained in RAN service until her decommissioning on 3 June 1983.

* Established in 1950, East Africa conducted seven tours between 1954 and 1982 and played against incoming international, representative and club touring sides including twice against the British Lions; perhaps the only example of representative (as opposed to invitational) multinational teams playing against each other. They also played against the Barbarians.
** (formerly Tanganyika)
* A similar development in 2004 has been the Pacific Islanders team.
** 
* The South American Jaguars were a combination team who played South Africa during the early 1980s.

* The African Leopards are a development side drawn from across Africa, they have played representative rugby union against South African students.
* The Arabian Gulf rugby union team combined various teams from Arab countries in the Persian Gulf and competed in World Cup qualification. The Arabian Gulf Rugby Union has now been dismantled and responsibility for the game devolved to each of the member nations, although the team may be revived in the future.
* There was also a West Indies side, which first toured when the &quot;Caribbean Rugby Union&quot; sent a team (managed by Gavin Clark) to tour England in 1976. Their last tour was also to England in October and November 2000.
* The Commonwealth of Independent States played during the early 1990s.
== Defunct national sides ==
Various national sides have ceased to exist for political reasons. In the case of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, there is more than one successor team. In the case of Catalonia, the Spanish Civil War and Franco&#x27;s crackdown put an end to it, and in the case of East and West Germany, reunification led to their amalgamation into a single German side.

* Arabian Gulf* – dissolved by the end of 2010 and replaced by separate unions and national teams
* CIS*
* * – a combination of Kenya, Tanzania/Tanganyika and Uganda. It has not played since 1982 but the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) still exists and there have been recent talks to resurrect the team

<text>HMAS &quot;Stawell&quot; (J348/M348) was a named for the town of Stawell, Victoria. Sixty &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were constructed during World War II, and &quot;Stawell&quot; was one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

The corvette later served in the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) as HMNZS &quot;Stawell&quot;.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Stawell&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Stawell&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria on 18 June 1942. She was launched on 3 April 1943 by Mrs. J. J. Dedman, wife of the Minister for War Organisation, and commissioned into the RAN on 7 August 1943.

==Operational history==

===RAN===
The majority of &quot;Stawell&quot;″s career was spent in three areas. Initially, she served as a convoy escort along the east coast of Australia. Following this, &quot;Stawell&quot; participated in a variety of escort, minesweeping, and combat roles throughout New Guinea waters. On 3 August 1945 she sank an armed Daihatsu barge in the Moluccas area. In the final third of her career, the ship spent time in Hong Kong waters, performing minsweeping and anti-piracy duties. &quot;Stawell&quot; returned to Brisbane in November 1945.

The corvette received three battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;.

===RNZN===
&quot;Stawell&quot; was removed from RAN service on 26 March 1946. On 5 March 1952, &quot;Stawell&quot; and three other &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes (HMA Ships , , and ) were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy.

She was commissioned into the RNZN during May 1952 and given the prefix HMNZS. &quot;Stawell&quot; operated primarily as a training vessel until 1959, when she was placed into reserve.

==Fate==
&quot;Stawell&quot; was sold to Pacific Scrap Limited of Auckland, New Zealand, in July 1968, and was broken up for scrap.

<text>Stawell ( &quot;stall&quot;), is an Australian town in the Wimmera region of Victoria west-north-west of the state capital, Melbourne. Located within the Shire of Northern Grampians local government area, it is a seat of local government for the shire and its main administrative centre. At the , Stawell had a population of .

It was founded in 1853 as Pleasant Creek during the Victorian gold rush. It is one of few towns in Victoria retaining an active gold mining industry.

Stawell is famed for the Stawell Gift, a professional foot race that began in 1878. It is also known as the gateway to the Grampians National Park. One of the most significant Aboriginal cultural sites in south-eastern Australia is [[Bunjil&#x27;s Shelter]], within the Black Range Scenic Reserve, south of Stawell.

It is named after Sir William Foster Stawell (1815–89), the Chief Justice of Victoria.

== Indigenous people ==
Aboriginal peoples of Victoria lived in the Stawell area for many thousands of years before the colonisation of Australia. The formally recognised traditional owners for the area north-east of the Horsham and Ararat roads, are the Wotjobaluk, Jardwadjali (also known as Jaadwa), Wergaia and Jupagalk nations. These nations are represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council Aboriginal Corporation. In the area of Stawell that is south-west of Horsham and Ararat roads traditional owners have not yet been formally recognised; however, the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation (EMAC) is negotiating a recognition and settlement agreement with the Victorian Government. The boundary of the agreement is under negotiation. The Eastern Maar people are represented by the Eastern Maar Aboriginal Corporation. The language spoken in the area is Djab Wurrung, and the local placename for Stawell in the indigenous language is Yirip

==Colonial history==
William McLachlan discovered alluvial gold at Pleasant Creek in May 1853, but the yield was not in sufficient volumes to attract much interest, as the Ballarat and Bendigo fields were known to be giving better results, and had already established the infrastructure to support the miners. There was however sufficient numbers for the area to support the beginnings of a settlement. The town site was first settled during 1853 and was named Pleasant Creek. The mining population of the Stawell field remained relatively small (averaging 200 or less) until 1857 when a series of new alluvial gold discoveries were made.

In August 1857 more extensive prospecting and mining occurred at what became known as Commercial Street, Pleasant Creek.

Two Post Offices were opened, Pleasant Creek on 19 October 1857 and Quartz Reef, Pleasant Creek on 1 June 1859. In 1858 diggers opened the Great Western goldfield, which was worked by some 9,000 prospectors. The prospecting spread to nearby Deep Lead, about 6 kilometres to northwest, and it was reported that at the height of the rush there were over 25,000 people in the area. At the same time, shafts were being sunk around Big Hill, becoming known as the Quartz Reefs. Much alluvial gold was found in the area but the &#x27;fossicking&#x27; petered out by 1859.

In 1864, the township was renamed to honour Sir William Stawell (1815–89), the Chief Justice of Victoria resulting in the name of the Pleasant Creek post office becoming &quot;Stawell&quot;. The town was created a borough in 1869.

In 1870 Stawell post office was renamed Stawell West, and Quartz Reef, Stawell post office was renamed to Stawell. Stawell Town Hall was constructed in 1872, under the guidance of Stawell Shire Engineer, John D&#x27;Alton.

The former Free Library and Mechanics Institute building at 170 Main Street was constructed in 1874 to the design of Stawell architect, George Inskip. The building has served as the location of the Mechanics Institute, School of Design (later School of Mines) and the Borough Library. It is now the headquarters of Australian Regional Education.

The town&#x27;s water supply system was designed by John D&#x27;Alton in 1875, diverting water from Fyan&#x27;s Creek by tunnels and pipelines, construction was completed in 1881.

By the mid-1920s the gold mining had effectively ceased as the yields were found to be no longer commercially viable. A Pioneer&#x27;s memorial was erected on Big Hill in 1938.

The town hall underwent significant postwar remodelling, culminating in the addition of the landmark clock tower in 1939.

The Quartz Gold Memorial and Dane Memorial seat were erected on Big Hill in 1953 out of local quartz stone.

Stawell&#x27;s historical association with gold-mining was revived when full-scale mining recommenced in 1981 with the opening of the Stawell Gold Mine.

The mine was closed in 2016, following pressure from environmental protection agencies, following the mines plans to turn open cut. This was followed by fear that the town would become a ghost town of sorts, however, the mine reopened fully in early 2019.

The town is at the junction of several major roads, the most significant being the Western Highway which bypasses the centre of town along Longfield Street linking it to the cities of Ararat, Ballarat and Melbourne in the east and the cities of Horsham and Adelaide to the west. The bypass has resulted in a new commercial centre spread along its length to the south of the town centre. Other significant roads include the Grampians Road (C216) used by many tourists on their journey to and from Halls Gap in the south west; Pomonal Road (C221) connecting it with the town of Pomonal to the south; Donald-Stawell Road (C238); and Navarre Road (C221) connecting it to the town of Navarre to the north. All major roads but the Western Highway converge in the town centre. Bus services operate from the Stawell railway station to nearby towns including Halls Gap.

<text>Rigdon Osmond Dees III (born March 14, 1950), best known as Rick Dees, is an American entertainer, radio personality, comedian, actor, and voice artist, best known for his internationally syndicated radio show &quot;The Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 Countdown&quot; and for the 1976 satirical novelty song &quot;Disco Duck&quot;.

Dees is a People&#x27;s Choice Award recipient, a Grammy-nominated performing artist, and Broadcast Hall of Fame inductee. He performed the title song for the film &quot;Meatballs&quot;. He co-founded the E. W. Scripps television network Fine Living, now the Cooking Channel, and has hosted &quot;Rick Dees in the Morning&quot; at KIIS-FM and KHHT in Los Angeles. Today he continues his own syndicated daily radio show, &quot;Daily Dees&quot; and the syndicated &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40 Countdown.&quot;

==Early life==
Dees was born Rigdon Osmond Dees III in Jacksonville, Florida, on March 14, 1950. He was raised in Greensboro, North Carolina. Dees graduated from Greensboro&#x27;s Grimsley High School and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in motion pictures, TV, and radio.

==Career==

===Radio===
Dees began his radio career at a Greensboro radio station called WGBG while still in high school. He worked for various radio stations throughout the southeastern United States, including WCAR (now known as WXYC) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; WSGN in Birmingham, Alabama; and WKIX in Raleigh, North Carolina.

His introduction to the international entertainment arena began while working at WMPS AM 680 (&quot;The Great 68&quot;) in Memphis, Tennessee, during the disco craze of the mid-to-late-1970s. He wrote and recorded &quot;Disco Duck&quot; in 1976; it sold more than six million copies. The song can be heard in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in a brief scene in which a group of older people were learning to &quot;move their feet to the disco beat&quot;. While this platinum recording earned him a People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite New Song, and the BMI Award for record sales in one year, Dees was expressly forbidden from playing the song on the air by station management (rival stations refused to play it for fear of promoting their competition). Dees was fired from WMPS when he mentioned that his song, &quot;Disco Duck&quot;, was almost number 1, and his own radio station would not let him play it. The station manager said it was a conflict of interest. Dees did not perform the actual duck vocals on the song since he could not &quot;talk like a duck&quot;. The duck vocals were recorded at Shoestring Productions in Memphis, Tennessee by Ken Pruitt, who moved away before the song became popular, and the vocals for the duck were done by Michael Chesney of Memphis for the concert tour. Chesney had done some comedic voices for Dees prior to Disco Duck. The tour went from Disney World to New York City, billed as &quot;Rick Dees and The Cast of Idiots&quot;. After a 45-day non-compete clause in his contract was satisfied, Dees was hired by RKO Radio to do the morning show at WHBQ AM 560 in Memphis.

The success of Dees at their Memphis radio station, combined with his TV appearances and hit music, motivated station owner RKO General to offer Rick the morning radio show in Los Angeles at KHJ (AM). Dees helped their ratings, but AM music radio was rapidly losing ground to FM. When KHJ switched to country music, Dees left KHJ, taking a morning position at KIIS-FM in July 1981. In a short time, he turned KIIS-FM into the #1 revenue-generating radio station in America, with an asset value approaching half a billion dollars.

He began his &quot;Weekly Top 40&quot; countdown program, still currently in syndication, on the weekend of October 8–9, 1983 on 18 stations; the show was created after Dees&#x27;s station KIIS dropped &quot;American Top 40&quot; in a dispute over the playing of network commercials. The &quot;Weekly Top 40&quot; has been heard each weekend in over 200 countries worldwide and the Armed Forces Radio Network. It is distributed domestically by Compass Media Networks and internationally by Dees Entertainment International (through Radio Express). In December 2008, the &quot;Weekly Top 40&quot; became the first English-speaking radio show to air in China. The syndicated Countdown is available in several different editions including &quot;Hit Radio&quot; (for contemporary hit radio stations), &quot;Hot Adult&quot; (hot adult contemporary radio stations), 80s Edition and 90s Edition on terrestrial radio stations around the world.

After 23 years on radio station KIIS-FM, Dees left in February 2004 with no official explanation, and he was replaced by Ryan Seacrest. Dees returned to Los Angeles radio in August 2006 on KMVN, Movin 93.9, hosting the morning show along with Patti &quot;Long Legs&quot; Lopez and Mark Wong. On April 15, 2009, Movin 93.9 dismissed its radio personalities and changed the format to Spanish contemporary music after a leasing of the station to Mexico City business Grupo Radio Centro. Dees was one of the last voices on the station before the flip, redirecting listeners of his show to RICK.COM. On April 20, 2011, Dees returned for the second time, this time at KIIS&#x27;s sister station KHHT, following the station&#x27;s formatting shift to a Gold-based Rhythmic AC. His show at KHHT lasted for a year. 

Dees continues distribution of his &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot; Countdown globally to terrestrial radio stations and streaming in the U.S., making it the longest continuously running countdown featuring pop music in the world. He also continues to host the syndicated &quot;Daily Dees&quot; show, and can be heard in Hawaii on Kohala Radio KNKR 96.1 FM each morning live.

Dees has garnered many accolades, including the Marconi Award, induction into both the National Radio Hall of Fame, and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall Of Fame. In 1984, he received a Grammy Award nomination for his comedy album &quot;Hurt Me Baby – Make Me Write Bad Checks&quot; and has since received the Grammy Governor&#x27;s Award. His other comedy albums – &quot;I&#x27;m Not Crazy&quot;, &quot;Rick Dees Greatest Hit (The White Album)&quot;, and &quot;Put It Where The Moon Don&#x27;t Shine&quot; have also enjoyed worldwide success. He is an inductee in the North Carolina Music Hall Of Fame, the Tennessee Radio Hall Of Fame, has received the Billboard Radio Personality Of The Year award for 10 consecutive years, received a People&#x27;s Choice Award, and has been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

===Films and television===
In television, Dees hosted his own late-night show on the ABC television network in the early 1990s, &quot;Into the Night Starring Rick Dees&quot;, which ran for one season and was canceled due to low ratings. He has guest-starred on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;&quot; and many other hit shows. In addition, Dees hosted the syndicated series &quot;Solid Gold&quot; from Paramount Television, and his voice has been a part of numerous animated features, including &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, where he starred as Rock Dees, and &quot;&quot;, where he voiced Rocket Rick.

In feature films, Dees starred in &quot;La Bamba&quot;, portraying the iconic Ted Quillin, the Los Angeles disc jockey who helped launch Ritchie Valens&#x27;s career.

His voice was heard as the radio DJ during the opening credits of the film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, released in 1983.

In 2020, Dees provided the voice of Peter Griffin&#x27;s impression of him in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;La Famiglia Guy&quot;.

==&quot;Fisher v. Dees&quot; and other legal trouble==
In 1984, Dees (and his record company) made a request of Marvin Fisher, the owner of the copyright in the music of the song &quot;When Sunny Gets Blue&quot;, for permission to use the song in a parody of the performance by Johnny Mathis. Fisher refused to grant permission for the use. Dees decided to do a parody even without the permission of the copyright holder, using about 29 seconds of the song in a parody album titled &quot;Put It Where the Moon Don&#x27;t Shine&quot;.

Fisher sued Dees for copyright infringement. The trial court found that the parody song, titled &quot;When Sonny Sniffs Glue,&quot; was clearly intended to &quot;poke fun&quot; at the style of singing for which Johnny Mathis was well known, and thus was not infringing. The decision was upheld on appeal, in &quot;Fisher v. Dees&quot; 794 F.2d 432 (9th Cir. 1986).

In an unrelated 1991 case, Dees was successfully sued for $10 million in damages. The court found Dees and his business manager acted with &quot;malice and oppression&quot; in diverting profits from Dees&#x27;s Top 40 countdown program and gave the judgment to a former business partner.

<text>Pure Prairie League is an American country rock band which featured in its original lineup, singer and guitarist Craig Fuller, drummer Tom McGrail and steel guitarist John David Call, all from Waverly in southern Ohio. Fuller started the band in 1970 and McGrail named it after a fictional 19th century temperance union featured in the 1939 Errol Flynn cowboy film &quot;Dodge City&quot;. In 1975 the band scored its biggest hit with the single &quot;Amie&quot;, a track that originally appeared on their 1972 album &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot;. Pure Prairie League scored five consecutive Top 40 LPs in the 1970s and added a sixth in the 1980s. They disbanded in 1988 but regrouped in 1998 and continue to perform. The line-up has been fluid over the years, with no one member having served over the band&#x27;s entire history. The band&#x27;s most recent line-up consists of Call, drummer Scott Thompson, keyboardist/guitarist Randy Harper, guitarist Jeff Zona and bassist Jared Camic. Other notable musicians to have played with Pure Prairie League include guitarists Vince Gill, Gary Burr and Curtis Wright.

==History==
The band was formed in Columbus, Ohio in 1970 and had its first success in Cincinnati. Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school, notably the Vikings, the Omars, the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy.

In 1970 the first Pure Prairie League line-up was Fuller, McGrail, singer/songwriter/guitarist George Ed Powell (a popular Cincinnati folk singer), Phill Stokes (bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and J.D. Blackfoot) and Robin Suskind (a popular guitar teacher in the University of Cincinnati neighborhood) on guitar and mandola, with John David Call joining the band later that year. Call&#x27;s steel guitar added country credibility to the band&#x27;s playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band. They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dilly&#x27;s Pub in the Mt. Adams section of Cincinnati.

In mid-1971, McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with , but were unable to put a viable band together. Jim Caughlan, who had played guitar and drums with Fuller, Call and McGrail in earlier bands, took over on drums, and Jim Lanham from California, formerly of The Yellow Payges and Country Funk, replaced Stokes on bass. Suskind departed as well, soon after the arrival of Caughlan and Lanham. 

Early on, Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and made contact with a well-known Cleveland based rock and roll promoter, Roger Abramson. At the behest of the group&#x27;s roadie Jim &quot;Westy&quot; Westermeyer (who had also worked for the James Gang), Abramson saw the band at New Dilly&#x27;s Pub and later signed them to a management contract. Abramson was able to land a contract with RCA Records. He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time.

Their self-titled first album used a Norman Rockwell &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; cover, showing a trail-worn cowboy named Sad Luke, who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafter. After releasing their debut album (recorded in New York City) in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour, Call, Caughlan and Lanham all left the band.

At that point, Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCA&#x27;s Toronto studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe (who had also produced the first album). Al Brisco played pedal steel guitar on the session. &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; (begun in the summer of 1972) was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powell. Billy Hinds from Cincinnati joined the band on drums and Hinds&#x27;s friend, Michael Connor, played piano on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come. Mick Ronson added string arrangements to several tracks, most notably &quot;Boulder Skies&quot; and &quot;Call Me Tell Me&quot;. Michael Reilly, who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band, joined in early September 1972, soon after the record was completed. &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; was released in October 1972.

Reilly explains how he came to be involved with PPL:

&quot;I was from Fort Thomas, Kentucky, right near the Ohio border. When I was 14 I went out to Sears and bought a Danelectro Silvertone bass, learned how to play it, got a couple of guys together and we formed a band called the Marc IV. We played swim clubs and sock hops and stuff like that back in 1964. Eventually I joined the last incarnation of The Lemon Pipers (of &quot;Green Tambourine&quot; fame). I wasn’t on the original recordings and I wasn’t touring with the original band, but they were from the same area I was from: Oxford, Ohio. As a teenager, I used to play the bars in Oxford every weekend and I knew all the guys who had been in that band. Bill Bartlett was a great guitar player and Dale Brown was the lead singer. I eventually moved to Woodstock, New York and was in a band called the Robert Lee Band with this singer/songwriter from Florida named Robert Lee. Michael Conner and Billy Hinds — the piano player and drummer from Pure Prairie League — were living in Woodstock as well, and we got a chance to record an album in London. “Amie” was recorded in the summer of 1972 and was released around Christmas of ’72 or January of ’73. But we had started touring for that album in September of 1972. The first show I ever played with Pure Prairie League was on Labor Day of ’72 and that was at the Erie Canal Soda Pop Festival in Bull Island, Illinois. Most of the Woodstock lineup, along with 300,000 people, were there, so it was quite a way to start! We signed with a booking agency in Minneapolis called Variety Artists International, and they were one of the biggest college booking agents in the country. So we went out and we started touring at different colleges doing 250–275 shows a year for eight years in a row, or so. That was it — pretty much, it was us jamming “Amie” down every college student’s throat. Plus, lots of kids in college at that time wanted to learn how to play guitar and “Amie” was a pretty easy song for them to learn on, so it became a popular college hit. All the college radio stations started playing it, and then other radio stations were picking it up, too, and then RCA finally perked up and said, “We gotta find these guys and see what’s going on.&quot;
Shortly after touring behind &quot;Bustin Out&quot;, the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in Kentucky. But before conscientious objector (C.O.) status could be arranged, he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973. At this point, RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak.

By August 1973, the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements, and was not inclined to rejoin at that time. (He was eventually given a full pardon by President Gerald Ford.) Reilly took over as the band&#x27;s leader and front man and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called the Sacred Mushroom.

Pure Prairie League hit the road and began playing gigs constantly, mostly in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. As Reilly related above, as a result of their heavy schedule, particularly at colleges, their songs became well known; &quot;Amie&quot; (Craig Fuller&#x27;s ode to an on-again/off-again relationship), from the second album, became a particular favorite.

==Success==
As &quot;Amie&quot; grew in popularity, radio stations began receiving requests for it. As a result, RCA re-released the &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;Pure Prairie League &quot; albums and re-issued &quot;Amie&quot; as a single. It peaked at No. 27 on April 26, 1975, just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on mid-western college campuses.

RCA re-signed Pure Prairie League, who relocated to Los Angeles and recorded their third album, &quot;Two Lane Highway&quot;, which was released in June 1975. It featured guest appearances by Chet Atkins, fiddler Johnny Gimble, Don Felder from The Eagles and Emmylou Harris, who dueted with the band on the song &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Believe It&quot;, which received much airplay on country stations. &quot;Highway&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest &#x27;charter&#x27; at No. 24, and &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; reached gold status. And &quot;That&#x27;ll Be The Day&quot;, a cover of the 1957 Buddy Holly &amp; the Crickets hit, was their lone appearance on the Country charts at No. 96 in 1976. This began a string of five consecutive Top 40 album releases, as &quot;If the Shoe Fits&quot; (January 1976), &quot;Dance&quot; (November 1976) and &quot;Live, Takin&#x27; the Stage&quot; (September 1977) all made the Top 40.

In 1977 Call left because of increasing back troubles. Larry Goshorn&#x27;s brother, Tim, joined in time to record &quot;Just Fly&quot; (March 1978). But in 1978 there was a mass exodus as the Goshorns left to form their own group, The Goshorn Brothers, and Powell, the last remaining original member, retired from the road to run his pig farm in Ohio. However, the group soldiered on, as Reilly quickly brought in temporary members, California country rocker Chris Peterson (vocals, guitar) and the group&#x27;s soundman, Jeff Redefer (guitar), to play a few shows until new, permanent players could be located.

In September 1978 auditions led to the hiring of Vince Gill (vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, fiddle). Further auditions brought in Steven Patrick Bolin (vocals, guitars, flute) in January 1979. This revamped line-up recorded &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Back&quot; (June 1979), which turned out to be their last for RCA. Sax player Jeff Kirk accompanied the band on some of their dates during the 1979 tour.

Casablanca Records, who at this time was trying to play down its reputation as primarily a disco label, signed Pure Prairie League and other non-dance acts to its roster in 1980. In January, guitarist Jeff Wilson came in to replace Bolin, and the band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Firin&#x27; Up&quot; (February 1980) spawned the hits &quot;Let Me Love You Tonight&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Almost Ready&quot;, both sung by Gill, with saxophone accompaniment by David Sanborn. A second Casablanca release, &quot;Something in the Night&quot; (February 1981), kept Pure Prairie League on the charts with &quot;Still Right Here in My Heart&quot;. However, as fate would have it, Casablanca ultimately went bankrupt and was sold to Polygram Records. Polygram then dropped most of Casablanca&#x27;s roster, including Pure Prairie League.

Both Gill and Wilson left in early 1982, and Gill pursued a successful solo country career.

==Later years==
Despite the lack of a recording contract, the group still found itself in demand as a live act and played in clubs and at outdoor festivals.

Tim Goshorn returned in 1982 and Mike Hamilton (vocals, guitars, from Kenny Loggins&#x27; band) also joined the same year and was there for six months (until mid-1982) and joined again in 1987 for touring and for the recording of “Mementos”. 
Al Garth (vocals, woodwinds, fiddle, keyboards), another Loggins alumnus (Loggins &amp; Messina, also Poco and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band), joined as well, from 1982 to 1985.

Longtime drummer Billy Hinds retired from the road in 1984. He was first succeeded by Merel Bregante (also ex-Loggins &amp; Messina and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and then by Joel Rosenblatt (1985–1986) and Steve Speelman (ex-Steele) (1986–1988). Sax player Dan Clawson took over for Garth in 1985 and Gary Burr (vocals, guitars) was a member from 1984 to 1985.

1985 also saw the return of the group&#x27;s co-founder Craig Fuller (who had fronted the groups American Flyer and Fuller/Kaz in the mid-to-late 1970s, after he had returned to music).

&quot;Mementos 1971-1987&quot;, which contained re-recordings of their best known material plus four new songs, was released on the small Rushmore label in December 1987 and was recorded back in Ohio, where the band had returned their home base. It featured guest appearances from many of the band&#x27;s alumni, including Gill, Powell, the Goshorns, Call, Burr, Rosenblatt and Mike Hamilton.

In 1988 the band decided to call it quits. Fuller, who had already joined a reformed Little Feat in 1987, played with Pure Prairie League for their final shows in the spring of 1988.

==Rebirth==
A decade later (in 1998), Pure Prairie League was back with a line-up of Fuller, Connor, Reilly, Burr, Fats Kaplin (pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, accordion, washboard) and Rick Schell (vocals, drums, percussion). After two years, Burr was succeeded by Curtis Wright (vocals, guitars) in June 2000 and the group began work on a new album in 2002, yet abandoned the sessions and separated again after Schell became busy with other projects.

Michael Connor (born December 7, 1949) died after a long battle with cancer on September 2, 2004, at age 54. Following Connor&#x27;s death, the group resumed touring once again with Fuller, Reilly, Schell, Wright and Kaplin (when available) and released &quot;All in Good Time&quot; in November 2005. Their first album in 18 years, this release appeared on the small Drifter&#x27;s Church label.

Since this time, Pure Prairie League has continued to tour, playing a handful of shows every year. Donnie Lee Clark replaced Curtis Wright in late 2006 after Wright joined Reba McEntire&#x27;s band. Mike Reilly was sidelined in 2006 after he was forced to undergo a liver transplant. Jack Sundrud (from Poco) came in to sub for Reilly. Rick Plant also did a brief stint with them on bass before relocating to Australia in late 2006. Jeff &quot;Stick&quot; Davis (from Amazing Rhythm Aces) sat in on bass for Mike in 2007. In May 2007 Reilly appeared at a few shows and played guitar yet was unable to come back full-time until 2008. John David Call played some concerts in 2006 &amp; 2007, standing in for Kaplin, and returned to the band full-time in June 2010.

As of May 2011, it was announced, via the Pure Prairie League website, that Fuller would not be appearing at all of the band&#x27;s shows that year, as he decided to take a break from touring. He ended up leaving the group again altogether by 2012. On February 10, 2012 at The Syndicate in Newport, Kentucky, Fuller, his son Patrick, Tommy McGrail, and George Ed Powell (a frequent guest at their Ohio shows in recent years) took to the stage to join the current Pure Prairie League line-up of John David Call, Mike Reilly, Rick Schell and Donnie Lee Clark. In May 2012 Scott Thompson (vocals, drums, percussion) replaced Rick Schell, who departed to continue to grow his real estate business.

Former member Tim Goshorn (born November 27, 1954) died at his home in Williamstown, Kentucky after a bout with cancer on April 15, 2017, at age 62.

In 2018 the group added additional member Randy Harper on vocals, guitar and keyboards.

Tim Goshorn&#x27;s brother Larry, who had played with Pure Prairie League from 1973 to 1978, also fell victim to cancer and died on September 14, 2021.

In 2021 long time bassist Mike Reilly retired from the road due to health issues and fifteen year veteran Donnie Lee Clark departed as well, paving the way for new members Jared Camic (vocals, bass) and Jeff Zona (vocals, guitar). Reilly did return briefly in February 2022 as a special guest on the Rock Legends Cruise.

In December 2024, Pure Prairie League released &quot;Back on Track&quot;, their first album in almost two decades.

The band endorses a number of charitable efforts, Pittsburgh&#x27;s ongoing BurghSTOCK Concert Series among them.

<text>A fluorophore (or fluorochrome, similarly to a chromophore) is a fluorescent chemical compound that can re-emit light upon light excitation. Fluorophores typically contain several combined aromatic groups, or planar or cyclic molecules with several π bonds.

Fluorophores are sometimes used alone, as a tracer in fluids, as a dye for staining of certain structures, as a substrate of enzymes, or as a probe or indicator (when its fluorescence is affected by environmental aspects such as polarity or ions). More generally they are covalently bonded to macromolecules, serving as a markers (or dyes, or tags, or reporters) for affine or bioactive reagents (antibodies, peptides, nucleic acids). Fluorophores are notably used to stain tissues, cells, or materials in a variety of analytical methods, such as fluorescent imaging and spectroscopy.

Fluorescein, via its amine-reactive isothiocyanate derivative fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), has been one of the most popular fluorophores. From antibody labeling, the applications have spread to nucleic acids thanks to carboxyfluorescein. Other historically common fluorophores are derivatives of rhodamine (TRITC), coumarin, and cyanine. Newer generations of fluorophores, many of which are proprietary, often perform better, being more photostable, brighter, or less pH-sensitive than traditional dyes with comparable excitation and emission.

== Fluorescence ==
The fluorophore absorbs light energy of a specific wavelength and re-emits light at a longer wavelength. The absorbed wavelengths, energy transfer efficiency, and time before emission depend on both the fluorophore structure and its chemical environment, since the molecule in its excited state interacts with surrounding molecules. Wavelengths of maximum absorption (≈ excitation) and emission (for example, Absorption/Emission = 485 nm/517 nm) are the typical terms used to refer to a given fluorophore, but the whole spectrum may be important to consider. The excitation wavelength spectrum may be a very narrow or broader band, or it may be all beyond a cutoff level. The emission spectrum is usually sharper than the excitation spectrum, and it is of a longer wavelength and correspondingly lower energy. Excitation energies range from ultraviolet through the visible spectrum, and emission energies may continue from visible light into the near infrared region.

The main characteristics of fluorophores are:
* Maximum excitation and emission wavelength (expressed in nanometers (nm)): corresponds to the peak in the excitation and emission spectra (usually one peak each).
* Molar absorption coefficient (in mol−1cm−1): links the quantity of absorbed light, at a given wavelength, to the concentration of fluorophore in solution.
* Quantum yield: efficiency of the energy transferred from incident light to emitted fluorescence (the number of emitted photons per absorbed photons).
* Lifetime (in picoseconds): duration of the excited state of a fluorophore before returning to its ground state. It refers to the time taken for a population of excited fluorophores to decay to 1/e (≈0.368) of the original amount.
* Stokes shift: the difference between the maximum excitation and maximum emission wavelengths.
* Dark fraction: the proportion of the molecules not active in fluorescence emission. For quantum dots, prolonged single-molecule microscopy showed that 20-90% of all particles never emit fluorescence. On the other hand, conjugated polymer nanoparticles (Pdots) show almost no dark fraction in their fluorescence. Fluorescent proteins can have a dark fraction from protein misfolding or defective chromophore formation.

These characteristics drive other properties, including photobleaching or photoresistance (loss of fluorescence upon continuous light excitation). Other parameters should be considered, as the polarity of the fluorophore molecule, the fluorophore size and shape (i.e. for polarization fluorescence pattern), and other factors can change the behavior of fluorophores.

Fluorophores can also be used to quench the fluorescence of other fluorescent dyes or to relay their fluorescence at even longer wavelengths.

== Size (molecular weight) ==
Most fluorophores are organic small molecules of 20–100 atoms (200–1000 Dalton; the molecular weight may be higher depending on grafted modifications and conjugated molecules), but there are also much larger natural fluorophores that are proteins: green fluorescent protein (GFP) is 27 kDa, and several phycobiliproteins (PE, APC...) are ≈240kDa. As of 2020, the smallest known fluorophore was claimed to be 3-hydroxyisonicotinaldehyde, a compound of 14 atoms and only 123 Da.

Fluorescence particles like quantum dots (2–10 nm diameter, 100–100,000 atoms) are also considered fluorophores.

The size of the fluorophore might sterically hinder the tagged molecule and affect the fluorescence polarity.

== Families ==

Fluorophore molecules could be either utilized alone, or serve as a fluorescent motif of a functional system. Based on molecular complexity and synthetic methods, fluorophore molecules could be generally classified into four categories: proteins and peptides, small organic compounds, synthetic oligomers and polymers, and multi-component systems.

Fluorescent proteins GFP, YFP, and RFP (green, yellow, and red, respectively) can be attached to other specific proteins to form a fusion protein, synthesized in cells after transfection of a suitable plasmid carrier.

Non-protein organic fluorophores belong to following major chemical families:
* Xanthene derivatives: fluorescein, rhodamine, Oregon green, eosin, and Texas red
* Cyanine derivatives: cyanine, indocarbocyanine, oxacarbocyanine, thiacarbocyanine, and merocyanine
* Squaraine derivatives and ring-substituted squaraines, including Seta and Square dyes
* Squaraine rotaxane derivatives: See Tau dyes
* Naphthalene derivatives (dansyl and prodan derivatives)
* Coumarin derivatives
* Oxadiazole derivatives: pyridyloxazole, nitrobenzoxadiazole, and benzoxadiazole
* Anthracene derivatives: anthraquinones, including DRAQ5, DRAQ7, and CyTRAK Orange
* Pyrene derivatives: cascade blue, etc.
* Oxazine derivatives: Nile red, Nile blue, cresyl violet, oxazine 170, etc.
* Acridine derivatives: proflavin, acridine orange, acridine yellow, etc.
* Arylmethine derivatives: auramine, crystal violet, malachite green
* Tetrapyrrole derivatives: porphin, phthalocyanine, bilirubin
* Dipyrromethene derivatives: BODIPY, aza-BODIPY

These fluorophores fluoresce due to delocalized electrons which can jump a band and stabilize the energy absorbed. For example, benzene, one of the simplest aromatic hydrocarbons, is excited at 254 nm and emits at 300 nm. This discriminates fluorophores from quantum dots, which are fluorescent semiconductor nanoparticles.

They can be attached to proteins to specific functional groups, such as amino groups (active ester, carboxylate, isothiocyanate, hydrazine), carboxyl groups (carbodiimide), thiol (maleimide, acetyl bromide), and organic azide (via click chemistry or non-specifically (glutaraldehyde)).

Additionally, various functional groups can be present to alter their properties, such as solubility, or confer special properties, such as boronic acid which binds to sugars or multiple carboxyl groups to bind to certain cations. When the dye contains an electron-donating and an electron-accepting group at opposite ends of the aromatic system, this dye will probably be sensitive to the environment&#x27;s polarity (solvatochromic), hence called environment-sensitive. Often dyes are used inside cells, which are impermeable to charged molecules; as a result of this, the carboxyl groups are converted into an ester, which is removed by esterases inside the cells, e.g., fura-2AM and fluorescein-diacetate.

<text>HMAS &quot;Strahan&quot; (J363/M363), named for the town of Strahan, Tasmania, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Strahan&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Strahan&quot; was laid down by the State Dockyard at Newcastle, New South Wales on 9 October 1942. She was launched on 12 July 1943 by Mrs. J. J. Cahill, wife of the Minister for Public Works and Local Government, and commissioned into the RAN on 14 March 1944.

==Operational history==
&quot;Strahan&quot; began her career in May 1944, arriving in New Guinea after completing trials to serve as an escort and anti-submarine vessel. In October 1944, &quot;Strahan&quot; was present in Morotai Harbour when the recently captured island was attacked by Japanese aircraft. The corvette was attacked by a dive-bomber, but was able to drive off the Japanese plane before she was damaged. The aircraft was then destroyed by an American Bofors shore installation, but there claims that &quot;Strahan&quot;″s 4-inch gun had seriously damaged the aircraft, and that it was in an uncontrollable dive when the Bofors blew it up.

In May 1945, &quot;Strahan&quot; travelled to Adelaide via Sydney, where she underwent a refit. Following this, she was immediate deployed back in New Guinea, and in June 1945 fired upon Japanese gun emplacements on Kairiru Island. In August, the corvette sank a Japanese supply craft off Tarakan, and captured three survivors.

Following the end of World War II, &quot;Strahan&quot; was assigned to the 21st Minesweeping Flotilla in Hong Kong, and performed in minesweeping and anti-piracy patrols. On 26 September, an acoustic mine detonated under &quot;Strahan&quot;″s stern while the corvette was pursuing Chinese pirates. Her rudder was damaged, and she had to be towed into Hong Kong Harbour by sister ship . She was repaired, and returned to Australia. In November, &quot;Strahan&quot; visited her namesake town. During the visit, a leading seaman drowned; the only casualty in the ship&#x27;s life. &quot;Strahan&quot; was decommissioned into reserve in Sydney on 25 January 1946, having sailed almost in her two-year career.

The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1944&quot;.

==Fate==
&quot;Strahan&quot; was sold to the Kinoshita Australia company for scrap on 6 January 1961. She was broken up at Green Point in Sydney during March 1963.

<doc id="532046" wikidata="Q2703215" url="?curid=532046" title="Pinus arizonica">
<text>Pinus arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona pine, is a medium-sized pine in northern Mexico, southeast Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and western Texas in the United States. It is a tree growing to 25–35 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up to . The needles are in bundles of 3, 4, or 5, with 5-needle fascicles being the most prevalent. This variability may be a sign of hybridization with the closely related ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;). The cones are single, paired, or in whorls of three, and 5–11 cm long.

==Taxonomy==
The Arizona pine was commonly thought to be a variant of Ponderosa pine, but since at least 1997 it is now recognized as a distinct species by most authorities.

Three varieties are described;
* &quot;Pinus arizonica&quot; var. &quot;arizonica&quot;, primarily in the Sierra Madre Occidental from Arizona and New Mexico south through Chihuahua to Durango and Zacatecas, west to Sonora and Sinaloa, and east through Coahuila to Nuevo León.
* &quot;Pinus arizonica&quot; var. &quot;stormiae&quot;, in the Sierra Madre Oriental from Coahuila and Nuevo León south to southwest Tamaulipas (in Miquihuana) and parts of San Luis Potosí. Possibly in the Big Bend National Park in Texas.
* &quot;Pinus arizonica&quot; var. &quot;cooperi&quot;, in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Chihuahua and Durango. This variety was originally described as a distinct species, but was subsumed under &quot;Pinus arizonica&quot; by Farjon in 1997. Among some primarily Mexican botanists this change has not proved popular. It has also been reclassified as a subspecies by Silba in 2009 on the basis of it being more distinct than var. &quot;stormiae&quot;, although this taxonomy is followed by even fewer authors. Some authors regard this as more closely related to Hartweg&#x27;s pine (&quot;Pinus hartwegii&quot;).

==Uses==
This pine is a source of construction timber, and is heavily harvested for firewood. Extensive cutting has reduced the formerly widespread Arizona pine forests, particularly in Mexico.

<text>Westminster University is a private university in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It was founded in 1875 and comprises four schools.

==History==
Westminster University was founded in 1875 as the Salt Lake Collegiate Institute, a preparatory school. Westminster first offered college classes in 1897 as Sheldon Jackson College. Named in honor of its primary benefactor and a Presbyterian minister, Sheldon Jackson, the college operated for many years on the Collegiate Institute campus in downtown Salt Lake City under the supervision of the First Presbyterian Church of Salt Lake City.

The college changed its name to Westminster College in 1902 to better reflect a more general Protestant education. The name is derived from the Westminster Confession of Faith, a Presbyterian confession of faith, which was named for the district of London where it was devised. The University of Westminster in London is a separate higher education institution in the United Kingdom and is not affiliated with Westminster College.

High school level classes ceased to be offered in 1945, and Westminster became the first accredited two-year junior college in the intermountain area. In 1935, Westminster modified its curriculum to qualify as a four-year junior college and in 1949 became a four-year liberal arts university offering baccalaureate degrees in the arts and sciences.

On September 19, 2022, President Bethami Dobkin announced that starting Fall semester 2023, Westminster College would be known as Westminster University to reflect the comprehensive institutional offerings of the school.

Students from all religions are welcome, as Westminster severed its official ties to the Presbyterian church in 1974. In 2019 the college replaced its traditional crest emblem, a shield emblazoned with the term &quot;Pro Christo et Libertate&quot; (&quot;For Christ and Liberty&quot;), for a new seal bearing the motto &quot;Discendo Vita Abundantior&quot; (&quot;Life Made More Abundant by Learning&quot;).

==Campus==

Originally located in downtown Salt Lake City, the college moved to its present campus on in the Sugar House neighborhood of the city in 1911 where it is still located today. Emigration Creek runs through the campus. This land was donated by Civil War Veteran Colonel William M. Ferry Jr.

On campus are two gyms each equipped with a basketball court, weight room, and studio.

The larger of the buildings, the Eccles Health Wellness and Athletics Center (HWAC), also has an indoor pool, three story rock climbing wall, and racket ball court.

As Westminster University is located on 27 acres in the heart of Salt Lake City, administration has had to be careful and smart about the growing student population. The sixteenth president of Westminster College, Michael S. Bassis, saw a need for growing into and connecting with the Sugar House community. During his presidency he acquired Garfield School to the east, with plans on converting it into a center for the arts. However, it was sold to the Elizabeth Academy, a private Montessori school in February 2017.

Bassis also struck a deal to have Westminster on the Draw built on 1300 East, directly across the street from Sugar House Park. This seven-floor space has many uses. The bottom level is used as academic and event space, the second floor (street level) is used as business space, and the remaining floors are used as housing for upper-classmen and graduate students.

==Administration==
Westminster University has had nineteen presidents since its founding; the current president, Bethami Dobkin, was appointed in July 2018. It has an endowment of $79 million as of June 30, 2020. The Board of Trustees added Amy C. Wadsworth, the founding CAO of Salt Lake Arts Academy, after her retirement in June 2019, known for her historical novel reviewed by American western historian Will Bagley.

==Academics==
Westminster University comprises four schools: the School of Arts and Sciences, the Bill and Vieve Gore School of Business, the School of Education, and the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. It operates on a fall and spring semester system with a mini term in May and eight- and twelve-week summer terms.

Westminster offers 38 undergraduate majors conferring BS, BBA, BA, and BFA degrees, which do not include its customized majors and pre-med, pre-law, and pre-dental programs. In addition to a number of post-baccalaureate certificate programs in various fields, Westminster also offers 13 graduate degrees: Master of Business Administration (MBA), Project-Based Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Business Administration in Technology Commercialization (MBATC), Master of Accountancy (MAcc), Master of Arts in Community Leadership (MACL), Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Master of Education (MEd), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP), Doctor of Nursing Practice - Nurse Anesthesia (DNAP), Master of Public Health (MPH), Master of Science in Mental Health Counseling (MSMHC), Master of Science in Nursing: Family Nurse Practitioner (MSN), and Master of Strategic Communication (MSC).

Westminster University recently launched a new program within the Gore School of Business focusing on training students to be entrepreneurs. The Center for New Enterprise will offer graduate and undergraduate degrees as well as community education programs in entrepreneurship.

The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Programs throughout the university are accredited as well.

===Recognition===
U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Westminster in its 2022 &quot;Best College&quot; guide in the following lists: &quot;Best Regional Universities&quot; (No. 18); &quot;Best Value Schools&quot; (No. 19); &quot;Best College for Veterans&quot; (No. 9); and &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot; (No. 15).

==Student life==
The university has over 70 campus clubs and organizations. The Associated Students of Westminster is the student association on campus. The school newspaper is a bi-weekly called &quot;The Forum&quot;. There is also a nationally recognized literary journal known as &quot;Ellipsis&quot;. The &quot;Estonian,&quot; Westminster&#x27;s student yearbook, was last published in 1987. The university publishes an alumni magazine, &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;, on a bi-annual schedule.

==Athletics==
The Westminster athletic teams are called the Griffins. The university is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC) for most of its sports since the 2015–16 academic year (which they were a member on a previous stint from 1967–68 to 1978–79 before suspending its athletics program); while its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s alpine skiing teams compete in the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RMISA) affiliated with the NCAA. The Griffins previously competed in the Frontier Conference of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1998–99 to 2014–15.

Westminster competes in 15 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include alpine ski, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include alpine ski, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball. Current non-NCAA sports include cheerleading, cycling, dance, men&#x27;s soccer (club) and snowboard.

===Olympians===
More than 50 Olympians have pursued their educational aspirations at Westminster, earning degrees along with 10 medals. The Griffins have competed in at least four Winter Olympic Games. Most of them as part of a 2005–2018 partnership between the college and U.S. Ski and Snowboard. Twenty-three Westminster students made up 10% of Team USA in Sochi and 18 students competed in the 2018 Pyeongchang games. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, 8 Olympians from Westminster will represent four different countries in Beijing: the U.S., Philippines, Ireland and Slovenia. One alum will compete in qualifying races for the 2022 USA Paralympic alpine skiing team.

===History===
The intercollegiate athletic teams were formerly called the Parsons, and Westminster was a member of the RMAC (in the NAIA), joining the conference in the summer of 1967 for football, basketball, and other team sports. A financial crisis at the school in 1979 caused it to discontinue intercollegiate athletics. Beginning in the 1990s, Westminster gradually began to restore its intercollegiate athletic program in the NAIA as the Griffins; it joined NCAA Division II in 2015 and returned to the RMAC, gaining full member status in 2018.
