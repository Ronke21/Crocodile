<text>Hydraulic engineering as a sub-discipline of civil engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water and sewage. One feature of these systems is the extensive use of gravity as the motive force to cause the movement of the fluids. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of bridges, dams, channels, canals, and levees, and to both sanitary and environmental engineering.

Hydraulic engineering is the application of the principles of fluid mechanics to problems dealing with the collection, storage, control, transport, regulation, measurement, and use of water. Before beginning a hydraulic engineering project, one must figure out how much water is involved. The hydraulic engineer is concerned with the transport of sediment by the river, the interaction of the water with its alluvial boundary, and the occurrence of scour and deposition. &quot;The hydraulic engineer actually develops conceptual designs for the various features which interact with water such as spillways and outlet works for dams, culverts for highways, canals and related structures for irrigation projects, and cooling-water facilities for thermal power plants.&quot;

==Fundamental principles==
A few examples of the fundamental principles of hydraulic engineering include fluid mechanics, fluid flow, behavior of real fluids, hydrology, pipelines, open channel hydraulics, mechanics of sediment transport, physical modeling, hydraulic machines, and drainage hydraulics.

=== Fluid mechanics ===
&quot;Fundamentals of Hydraulic Engineering&quot; defines hydrostatics as the study of fluids at rest. In a fluid at rest, there exists a force, known as pressure, that acts upon the fluid&#x27;s surroundings. This pressure, measured in N/m2, is not constant throughout the body of fluid. Pressure, p, in a given body of fluid, increases with an increase in depth. Where the upward force on a body acts on the base and can be found by the equation:

:formula_1

where, 
:&quot;ρ&quot; = density of water
:&quot;g&quot; = specific gravity
:&quot;y&quot; = depth of the body of liquid

Rearranging this equation gives you the pressure head formula_2. Four basic devices for pressure measurement are a piezometer, manometer, differential manometer, Bourdon gauge, as well as an inclined manometer.

As Prasuhn states:
: On undisturbed submerged bodies, pressure acts along all surfaces of a body in a liquid, causing equal perpendicular forces in the body to act against the pressure of the liquid. This reaction is known as equilibrium. More advanced applications of pressure are that on plane surfaces, curved surfaces, dams, and quadrant gates, just to name a few.

=== Behavior of real fluids ===
==== Real and Ideal fluids ====
The main difference between an ideal fluid and a real fluid is that for ideal flow &quot;p&quot;1 = &quot;p&quot;2 and for real flow &quot;p&quot;1 &gt; &quot;p&quot;2. Ideal fluid is incompressible and has no viscosity. Real fluid has viscosity. Ideal fluid is only an imaginary fluid as all fluids that exist have some viscosity.

==== Viscous flow ====
A viscous fluid will deform continuously under a shear force by the pascles law, whereas an ideal fluid does not deform.

==== Laminar flow and turbulence ====
The various effects of disturbance on a viscous flow are a stable, transition and unstable.

==== Bernoulli&#x27;s equation ====
For an ideal fluid, Bernoulli&#x27;s equation holds along streamlines.

:formula_3

As the flow comes into contact with the plate, the layer of fluid actually &quot;adheres&quot; to a solid surface. There is then a considerable shearing action between the layer of fluid on the plate surface and the second layer of fluid. The second layer is therefore forced to decelerate (though it is not quite brought to rest), creating a shearing action with the third layer of fluid, and so on. As the fluid passes further along with the plate, the zone in which shearing action occurs tends to spread further outwards. This zone is known as the &quot;boundary layer&quot;. The flow outside the boundary layer is free of shear and viscous-related forces so it is assumed to act as an ideal fluid. The intermolecular cohesive forces in a fluid are not great enough to hold fluid together. Hence a fluid will flow under the action of the slightest stress and flow will continue as long as the stress is present. The flow inside the layer can be either vicious or turbulent, depending on Reynolds number.

==Applications==
Common topics of design for hydraulic engineers include hydraulic structures such as dams, levees, water distribution networks including both domestic and fire water supply, distribution and automatic sprinkler systems, water collection networks, sewage collection networks, storm water management, sediment transport, and various other topics related to transportation engineering and geotechnical engineering. Equations developed from the principles of fluid dynamics and fluid mechanics are widely utilized by other engineering disciplines such as mechanical, aeronautical and even traffic engineers.

Related branches include hydrology and rheology while related applications include hydraulic modeling, flood mapping, catchment flood management plans, shoreline management plans, estuarine strategies, coastal protection, and flood alleviation.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Earliest uses of hydraulic engineering were to irrigate crops and dates back to the Middle East and Africa. Controlling the movement and supply of water for growing food has been used for many thousands of years. One of the earliest hydraulic machines, the water clock was used in the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of using gravity to move water include the Qanat system in ancient Persia and the very similar Turpan water system in ancient China as well as irrigation canals in Peru.

In ancient China, hydraulic engineering was highly developed, and engineers constructed massive canals with levees and dams to channel the flow of water for irrigation, as well as locks to allow ships to pass through. Sunshu Ao is considered the first Chinese hydraulic engineer. Another important Hydraulic Engineer in China, Ximen Bao was credited of starting the practice of large scale canal irrigation during the Warring States period (481 BC–221 BC), even today hydraulic engineers remain a respectable position in China.

In the Archaic epoch of the Philippines, hydraulic engineering also developed specially in the Island of Luzon, the Ifugaos of the mountainous region of the Cordilleras built irrigations, dams and hydraulic works and the famous Banaue Rice Terraces as a way for assisting in growing crops around 1000 BC. These Rice Terraces are 2,000-year-old terraces that were carved into the mountains of Ifugao in the Philippines by ancestors of the indigenous people. The Rice Terraces are commonly referred to as the &quot;Eighth Wonder of the World&quot;. It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1500 metres (5000 ft) above sea level. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half the globe.

Eupalinos of Megara was an ancient Greek engineer who built the Tunnel of Eupalinos on Samos in the 6th century BC, an important feat of both civil and hydraulic engineering. The civil engineering aspect of this tunnel was that it was dug from both ends which required the diggers to maintain an accurate path so that the two tunnels met and that the entire effort maintained a sufficient slope to allow the water to flow.

Hydraulic engineering was highly developed in Europe under the aegis of the Roman Empire where it was especially applied to the construction and maintenance of aqueducts to supply water to and remove sewage from their cities. In addition to supplying the needs of their citizens they used hydraulic mining methods to prospect and extract alluvial gold deposits in a technique known as hushing, and applied the methods to other ores such as those of tin and lead.

In the 15th century, the Somali Ajuran Empire was the only hydraulic empire in Africa. As a hydraulic empire, the Ajuran State monopolized the water resources of the Jubba and Shebelle Rivers. Through hydraulic engineering, it also constructed many of the limestone wells and cisterns of the state that are still operative and in use today. The rulers developed new systems for agriculture and taxation, which continued to be used in parts of the Horn of Africa as late as the 19th century.

Further advances in hydraulic engineering occurred in the Muslim world between the 8th and 16th centuries, during what is known as the Islamic Golden Age. Of particular importance was the &#x27;water management technological complex&#x27; which was central to the Islamic Green Revolution. The various components of this &#x27;toolkit&#x27; were developed in different parts of the Afro-Eurasian landmass, both within and beyond the Islamic world. However, it was in the medieval Islamic lands where the technological complex was assembled and standardized, and subsequently diffused to the rest of the Old World. Under the rule of a single Islamic caliphate, different regional hydraulic technologies were assembled into &quot;an identifiable water management technological complex that was to have a global impact.&quot; The various components of this complex included canals, dams, the &quot;qanat&quot; system from Persia, regional water-lifting devices such as the &quot;noria, shaduf&quot; and screwpump from Egypt, and the windmill from Islamic Afghanistan. Other original Islamic developments included the &quot;saqiya&quot; with a flywheel effect from Islamic Spain, the reciprocating suction pump and crankshaft-connecting rod mechanism from Iraq, and the geared and hydropowered water supply system from Syria.

===Modern times===
In many respects, the fundamentals of hydraulic engineering have not changed since ancient times. Liquids are still moved for the most part by gravity through systems of canals and aqueducts, though the supply reservoirs may now be filled using pumps. The need for water has steadily increased from ancient times and the role of the hydraulic engineer is a critical one in supplying it. For example, without the efforts of people like William Mulholland the Los Angeles area would not have been able to grow as it has because it simply does not have enough local water to support its population. The same is true for many of our world&#x27;s largest cities. In much the same way, the central valley of California could not have become such an important agricultural region without effective water management and distribution for irrigation. In a somewhat parallel way to what happened in California, the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) brought work and prosperity to the South by building dams to generate cheap electricity and control flooding in the region, making rivers navigable and generally modernizing life in the region.

Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) performed experiments, investigated and speculated on waves and jets, eddies and streamlining. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) by formulating the laws of motion and his law of viscosity, in addition to developing the calculus, paved the way for many great developments in fluid mechanics. Using Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, numerous 18th-century mathematicians solved many frictionless (zero-viscosity) flow problems. However, most flows are dominated by viscous effects, so engineers of the 17th and 18th centuries found the inviscid flow solutions unsuitable, and by experimentation they developed empirical equations, thus establishing the science of hydraulics.

Late in the 19th century, the importance of dimensionless numbers and their relationship to turbulence was recognized, and dimensional analysis was born. In 1904 Ludwig Prandtl published a key paper, proposing that the flow fields of low-viscosity fluids be divided into two zones, namely a thin, viscosity-dominated boundary layer near solid surfaces, and an effectively inviscid outer zone away from the boundaries. This concept explained many former paradoxes and enabled subsequent engineers to analyze far more complex flows. However, we still have no complete theory for the nature of turbulence, and so modern fluid mechanics continues to be combination of experimental results and theory.

The modern hydraulic engineer uses the same kinds of computer-aided design (CAD) tools as many of the other engineering disciplines while also making use of technologies like computational fluid dynamics to perform the calculations to accurately predict flow characteristics, GPS mapping to assist in locating the best paths for installing a system and laser-based surveying tools to aid in the actual construction of a system.

<text>A , or , is an extremely long, highly specialized Japanese knife that is commonly used to fillet tuna, as well as many other types of large ocean fish.

The &quot;magurobōchō&quot; is a long knife with a blade length of 30 cm (12 inches) to 150 cm (60 inches) in addition to a long handle. It can fillet a tuna in a single cut, although usually two people are needed to handle the knife and the tuna. Often they are used by two people simultaneously, where the second person handles the other end, using a towel wrapped around the blade for protection. The flexible blade can be curved to match the shape of the spine to minimize the amount of meat remaining on the tuna carcass.

They are commonly found at wholesale fish markets in Japan, the largest of which is the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, for which they are often called , as there is little need for them elsewhere. They may be found at very large restaurants, but they are not used in a regular Japanese kitchen, unless there is a frequent need to fillet tuna with a weight of 200 kg (440 pounds) or more.

They are not designed for use as weapons, but as tools, although they have been used as weapons by yakuza.

<text>Sky &amp; Telescope (S&amp;T) is a monthly magazine covering all aspects of amateur and professional astronomy, including what to see in the sky tonight and new findings in astronomy. Other topics covered include:
*observing guides for planets, galaxies, star clusters, and other objects visible in the night sky
*reviews of telescopes and other astronomical equipment, books, and software
*events in the amateur astronomy community
*amateur telescope making
*astrophotography

The articles are intended for the informed lay reader and include detailed discussions of current discoveries, frequently by participating scientists. The magazine is illustrated in full color, with both amateur and professional photography of celestial sights, as well as tables and charts of upcoming celestial events.

==History==
&quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; was founded by Charles A. Federer and his wife Helen Spence Federer. The duo had formed the Sky Publishing Corporation in late 1939 to manage a magazine called &quot;The Sky&quot;, which focused on content for the amateur astronomy community. Then in mid-1941, they took on the editorial management of another magazine,&quot;The Telescope&quot;, where articles appeared presenting scientific findings for a popular audience. The first issue of &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; — November 1941 — was published from a new office at the Harvard College Observatory. 

In 2006, Sky Publishing Corporation was sold to New Track Media, a portfolio company of the private equity firm Boston Ventures. In 2014, New Track&#x27;s portfolio was sold to F+W Media. Following the mid-2019 bankruptcy of F+W media, the American Astronomical Society acquired &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot;.

For decades before the rise of the internet, Sky &amp; Telescope played a vital role in joining amateur astronomers across the country, and eventually across the globe. The magazine played an important role in the dissemination of knowledge about telescope making, through the column &quot;Gleanings for ATMs&quot; that ran from 1933 to 1990. In December 1995, the magazine published the Caldwell Catalogue, which was authored by Patrick Moore.

The magazine&#x27;s main competitor is &quot;Astronomy&quot;.

== Editors ==

* Charles A. Federer (1909–1999), first editor (1941–1964); Helen Spence Federer (1911–1983), first managing editor
* Joseph Ashbrook (1918–1980), second editor (1964–1980)
* Leif Robinson (1939–2011), third editor (1980–2000)

== Columns ==
Notable magazine columns have included:

* Celestial Calendar (published monthly since 1942)
* Gleanings for ATMs (published between 1933 and 1990)
* Astronomer&#x27;s Workbench 
* Deep-Sky Wonders, written by Walter Scott Houston from 1946 to 1993 and by Sue French from 1993 to 2018
* Binocular Highlights: Originally part of the &quot;Stars &amp; Planets&quot; column, starting in March 1994, it became its own column in 2006 as Northern Binocular Highlights, later simply Binocular Highlights.
Collections of Deep-Sky Wonders and Binocular Highlights columns were subsequently published as books. 

== Websites ==
In the late 1990s, &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; launched a website featuring night-sky sights and the latest developments in astronomy. With the magazine&#x27;s change in ownership to the nonprofit American Astronomical Society in 2019, the URL changed to skyandtelescope.org. The website&#x27;s viewership has since grown to 500,000 visitors per month. An associated website, shopatsky.com, offers globes, atlases, books, and other products. 

&quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; is also accessible to both print and digital subscribers via the Nxtbook platform.

<text>Northeast Ohio is a geographic and cultural region that comprises the northeastern counties of the U.S. state of Ohio. Definitions of the region consist of 16 to 23 counties between the southern shore of Lake Erie and the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, home to over 4.5 million people. It is anchored by the metropolitan area of Cleveland, the most populous city in the region with over 372,000 residents in 2020. Other metropolitan centers include Akron, Canton, Mansfield, Sandusky, and Youngstown. Northeast Ohio includes most of the area known historically as the Connecticut Western Reserve.

==Composition==
Different sources define the region as having various boundaries. In its most expansive usage, it contains six metropolitan statistical areas: Cleveland–Elyria, Akron, Canton–Massillon, Youngstown–Warren, Mansfield, and Weirton–Steubenville along with eight micropolitan statistical areas. There are 23 counties in the region, with over 4.5 million residents and a labor force of almost 2.2 million. The GDP (nominal) of Northeast Ohio is over $195 billion, which makes it comparable to that of New Zealand or the Republic of Ireland.

Most of Northeast Ohio is part of the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, which ranked as the 17th-largest Combined Statistical Area (CSA) in the United States as of the 2020 Census with a population of 3,769,834. It includes the six counties that make up Greater Cleveland (Cuyahoga, Lake, Geauga, Lorain, Medina, and Ashtabula), the Akron metropolitan area (Portage and Summit counties), the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area (Stark and Carroll counties), and the Sandusky metropolitan areas, in addition to the Norwalk, New Philadelphia–Dover, Wooster, Fremont, and Coshocton micropolitan areas.

The Cleveland–Akron–Canton media market covers much of this area, including all of Northeast Ohio except for the Youngstown/Warren region. It is the 19th largest in the United States as of 2023, according to Nielsen Media Research. Northeast Ohio and the Cleveland CSA are also part of the larger Great Lakes Megalopolis.

==Area codes==

In the 1950s, AT&amp;T assigned most of Northeast Ohio area code 216. The western half of the region, including Ashland and Richland counties, and parts of Huron, Wayne and Erie counties, was assigned area code 419. In 1996, area code 216 was reduced in size to cover the northern half of its prior area, centering on Cleveland. Area code 330 was introduced for the southern half of Northeast Ohio, including Summit, Portage, Medina, Stark, Columbiana and Mahoning counties, and much of Wayne, Trumbull and Tuscarawas counties.

In 1997, area code 216 was further split as the need for additional phone numbers grew. Area code 216 was again reduced in geographical area to cover the city of Cleveland and its inner ring suburbs. Area code 440 was introduced to cover the remainder of was what previously area code 216, including all of Lake, Lorain, Ashtabula and Geauga counties, and parts of Trumbull, Huron, Erie and Cuyahoga counties. Some communities, such as Parma and Parma Heights, were divided into multiple area codes. In 1999, Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced federal legislation to protect small and medium-sized cities from being split into two or more area codes.

In 2023, it was announced that by the third quarter of 2024, area code 440 would be exhausted. Area code 436 was assigned to overlap the existing area code 440. Any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered by area code 440 could be assigned a phone number in either the 436 or 440 are codes.

In 2000, it was anticipated that the available phone numbers in area code 330 would be exhausted, and an overlay area code was introduced. Area code 234 was assigned to overlap existing area code 330. With the creation of area code 234, any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered by area code 330 could be assigned a phone number in either the 234 or 330 area codes, with no change in local or long distance toll status. This made necessary the use of ten-digit dialing within the 330/234 area code region. After the introduction of area code 234, assignments of new telephone numbers in the area did not continue at an accelerated pace, and new phone numbers for area code 234 were not assigned until 2003.

<doc id="521855" wikidata="Q3042275" url="?curid=521855" title="Sahti">
<text>Sahti is a Finnish type of farmhouse ale made from malted and unmalted grains including barley and rye. Traditionally the beer is flavored with juniper in addition to, or instead of, hops; the mash is filtered through juniper twigs into a trough-shaped tun, called a &quot;kuurna&quot; in Finnish. Sahti is top-fermented and many have a banana flavor due to isoamyl acetate from the use of baking yeast, although ale yeast may also be used in fermenting.

The end product is a cloudy beer with phenolic flavors and a distinct taste similar to banana, balanced by the bitterness from the juniper branches. The carbonation level tends to be very low. Sahti was traditionally brewed as a farmhouse ale, but commercial versions are now available. Commercial sahti is usually 8% ABV. Sahti has to be stored cold until consumption and is therefore not available in all stores.

Within Finland, sahti has differing characteristics depending on which part of the country it is from. It is often known as Tavastian beer from Häme (well-known &quot;sahti&quot; areas, such as Sysmä, Joutsa, Kuhmoinen and Lammi, are in Häme) but it is also made in Finland Proper and some parts of Central Finland. Every year the Finnish sahti brewing championship is held on the first weekend in August.

== Brewing process ==
Traditionally, the most common &quot;sahti&quot; brewing process is using a long step infusion mash that may last up to six hours, after which the wort is lautered through the &quot;kuurna&quot;. Unlike most beers, traditional sahti wort goes straight from the lauter tun to the fermenter without boiling.

However, this is only one of several brewing processes that have traditionally been used. Sahti has also been brewed as a stone beer, with infusion mashing, with variants of decoction mashing, by boiling the mash in the kettle, and so on. Some regions of Finland have called their farmhouse ale &quot;taari&quot;, and in these areas different brewing processes appear to have been used, such as fermenting in the mash, and baking the wet malts in bread-like shapes before lautering.

== Commercial sahti brands ==
* Kellarin Varastopanimo Joutsa: Varastopanimon Sahti
* Panimoravintola Beer Hunter&#x27;s: Mufloni Sahti (from Pori)
* Finlandia Sahti and Finlandia Strong Sahti (from Sastamala)
* Hartolan Sahti, known as Krouvin Sahti and Punakallion Sahti.
* Hollolan Hirvi Kivisahti
* Huvila sahti (from Savonlinna)
* Joutsan Sahti
* Lammin Sahti (from Lammi)
* Tiinan Sahti (from Sysmä)
* Stadin Panimo: Stadin Sahti (from Helsinki)
* Olu Bryki Raum / Vanhan Rauman Panimo: Kullervo (Rauma)

== In other countries ==
A farmhouse ale that in some cases is similar is brewed on the Swedish island of Gotland (known as Gotlandsdricka). An even closer relative in terms of flavour is a farmhouse ale known as &quot;koduõlu&quot; (lit. &quot;home beer&quot;), brewed on the Estonian islands in the Baltic.

In Estonia one commercial beer is sometimes described as &quot;Estonian sahti&quot;, despite actually being an Estonian koduõlu:
* Pihtla Õlu from Pihtla õlleköök, Estonia

Finnish sahti has protected status in Europe., so that in order to be described as sahti a beer must be brewed following something close to the traditional process and ingredients. Modern craft beer versions of sahti can be somewhat removed from the original style, because brewers may use more hops, might not use juniper twigs, could introduce more carbonation, boil the wort, and may not use Finnish baking yeast.

In many countries sahti has been the subject of recent interest by homebrewers and microbreweries who have brewed many takes on the style. It is not clear if any of them actually resemble the original Finnish sahti beers in any way, so in the EU most of these beers could not be marketed as sahti.

<text>Morgunblaðið (, &quot;The Morning Paper&quot;) is an Icelandic daily newspaper. &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;″s website, mbl.is, is the most popular website in Iceland. It is currently the country&#x27;s only daily printed newspaper.

==History==
&quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; was founded by Vilhjálmur Finsen and Ólafur Björnsson, brother of Iceland&#x27;s first president, Sveinn Björnsson. The first issue, only eight pages long, was published on 2 November 1913.

On 25 February 1964, the paper first printed a caricature by Sigmúnd Jóhannsson which featured the first landings on Surtsey. He became a permanent cartoonist for &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot; in 1975 and worked there until October 2008.

In a controversial decision, the owners of the paper decided in September 2009 to appoint Davíð Oddsson, a member of the Independence Party, Iceland&#x27;s longest-serving Prime Minister and former Governor of the Central Bank, as one of the two editors of the paper.

In May 2010, Helgi Sigurðsson was hired as the papers cartoonist. He became known for controversial drawings on topics such as immigration, refugees and COVID-19. His last drawing was published on 14 December 2021. On 7 January 2022, it was reported that Helgi had resigned from &quot;Morgunblaðið&quot;, following editorial requests that he tone down his latest submissions.

==Overview==
Originally introduced as a concept car at the 1998 Birmingham Motor Show, the 340R is a special edition of the Lotus Elise. 340 were built, and all were sold before they were manufactured. It uses a custom built bodyshell with no roof or doors. All cars came with a silver and black colour scheme. Special A038R tyres were developed for the 340R in collaboration with Yokohama.

While road-legal in the UK and Europe, most of the surviving cars are only used for racing, track use, or demonstrations.

<text>James Boyle Uniacke (1799 – 26 March 1858) led the first responsible government in Canada as it is today or any colony of the British Empire. He was the first Premier of the colony of Nova Scotia from 1848 to 1854 serving concurrently as the colony&#x27;s Attorney-General.

The son of Richard John Uniacke, James was born to politics and entered the colony&#x27;s legislative assembly in 1832 as a Conservative. In 1838 he joined the Executive Council and became a Reformer during the struggle for responsible government culminating in the 1848 election, the first under responsible government, which resulted in a Liberal Party administration led by Uniacke with Howe becoming more prominent after 1851 as Uniacke&#x27;s health declined.

Uniacke worked closely with Joseph Howe, the most influential reform politician of the era and put Howe in his cabinet as Provincial Secretary. The two politicians worked to adapt Nova Scotia&#x27;s institutions to the new democratic forms. Uniacke retired as Premier in 1854 to become commissioner of crown lands and surveyor general.

In 1832, Uniacke married Rosina Jane, the daughter of John Black. Uniacke lived for years with Rosina in what is now known as the Black-Binney House, which is now a national historic site.

<text>WCCO-TV (channel 4), branded CBS Minnesota, is a television station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, serving the Twin Cities area. It is owned and operated by the CBS television network through its CBS News and Stations division, and maintains studios on South 11th Street along Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis; its transmitter is located at the Telefarm complex in Shoreview, Minnesota.

WCCO-TV&#x27;s programming is also seen on full-power satellite station KCCW-TV (channel 12) in Walker (with transmitter near Hackensack). Nielsen Media Research treats WCCO-TV and KCCW-TV as one station in local ratings books, using the identifier name WCCO+. From 1987 until 2017, WCCO-TV operated a second satellite, KCCO-TV (virtual and VHF digital channel 7) in Alexandria (with transmitter near Westport).

WCCO is one of three owned-and-operated network affiliates in the Twin Cities market, the others being Fox O&amp;O KMSP-TV (channel 9) and MyNetworkTV O&amp;O WFTC (channel 9.2).

==History==

WCCO-TV&#x27;s roots originate with a radio station, but not WCCO (830 AM). Radio station WRHM, which signed on the air in 1925, is the station to which WCCO-TV traces its lineage. In 1934, two newspapers—the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Saint Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch&quot;—formed a joint venture named &quot;Twin Cities Newspapers&quot;, which purchased the radio station and changed its call letters to WTCN. Twin Cities Newspapers later expanded into the fledgling FM band with WTCN-FM, and shortly thereafter to the then-new medium of television with the launch of WTCN-TV on July 1, 1949, becoming Minnesota&#x27;s second television station, broadcasting from the Radio City Theater at 50 South 9th Street in downtown Minneapolis. Robert Ridder became president of WCCO-TV in 1949. Channel 4 has been a primary CBS affiliate since its sign on; it is the only major commercial station in the Minneapolis–St. Paul market not to have changed its primary affiliation. However, it had a secondary affiliation with ABC during its early years, from 1949 to 1953, until a new station using the WTCN-TV calls (now known as KARE-TV) picked up the ABC affiliation, retaining it from its 1953 sign on until 1961 when it became an independent station; it has been affiliated with NBC since 1979.

Twin Cities Newspapers sold off its broadcast holdings in 1952, with channel 4 going to the Murphy and McNally families, who had recently bought the Twin Cities&#x27; dominant radio station, WCCO, from CBS. The stations merged under a new company, Midwest Radio and Television, with CBS as a minority partner. The call letters of channel 4 were changed to WCCO-TV to match its new radio sibling on August 17 (the WTCN-TV call sign appeared again in the market the following year on the new channel 11). CBS was forced to sell its minority ownership stake in the WCCO stations in 1954 to comply with Federal Communications Commission ownership limits of the time.

In 1959, WCCO became the first station in the midwest to have a videotape machine; it came at a cost of $50,000 and one part-time employee was hired to operate the machine.

On July 23, 1962, WCCO-TV was involved in the world&#x27;s first live international broadcast via the Telstar satellite; the station&#x27;s mobile units provided the feed for all three networks, ABC, CBS, and NBC, for a program originating from native land in the Black Hills showing Mount Rushmore to the world.
The station began telecasting color programs in 1955. In September 1983, WCCO relocated its operations from its longtime studios on South 9th Street to the present location at South 11th Street and Nicollet Mall. The network gained full ownership of WCCO-TV in 1992, when it acquired what was by then known as Midwest Communications. In 2000, Viacom bought CBS, and WCCO became part of the Viacom Television Stations Group. In 2006, Viacom Television Stations Group was renamed CBS Television Stations when Viacom split into two companies.

During the 1980s, a cable-exclusive sibling station was created to supplement WCCO, with its own slate of local and national entertainment programming. This was known as &quot;WCCO II&quot;, but by 1989, it had evolved into the &quot;Midwest Sports Channel&quot;, focusing on regional sporting events. It continued under CBS ownership until 2000, when it was announced that MSC and sibling RSN Home Team Sports were to be sold. HTS went to Comcast, while MSC was sold to Fox Entertainment Group and became part of Fox Sports Net, becoming Fox Sports North. It had been an FSN affiliate since 1997.

On February 2, 2017, CBS agreed to sell CBS Radio to Entercom, currently the fourth-largest radio broadcasting company in the United States. The sale was completed on November 17, 2017, and was conducted using a Reverse Morris Trust so that it was tax-free. While CBS shareholders retain a 72% ownership stake in the combined company, Entercom, now Audacy, is the surviving entity, with WCCO radio and its sibling stations separated from WCCO-TV.

On August 13, 2019, National Amusements announced that Viacom and CBS Corporation would recombine their assets, forming the entity ViacomCBS. The sale was completed on December 4, 2019, resulting in CBS Television Stations, including WCCO-TV, becoming subsidiaries of ViacomCBS. On February 16, 2022, ViacomCBS changed its name to Paramount Global.

On August 14, 2023, Wendy McMahon, a former creative services director at WCCO-TV, was named CBS News and Stations president.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
In 1961, with the establishment of the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, the station, via CBS, which held the rights to broadcast NFL games, became the &#x27;unofficial&#x27; home station of the team. This partnership continued through the 1993 season, at which time most games were moved to WFTC. Today, most Vikings games are on KMSP-TV; since 1998, WCCO airs at least two Vikings games each season when the Vikings host an AFC team, or, since 2014, with the institution of the new &#x27;cross-flex&#x27; rules, any games that are moved from KMSP-TV. In 1992, WCCO provided coverage of Super Bowl XXVI and that year&#x27;s Final Four, which were hosted at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.

Since 2023, WCCO has aired select Minnesota Golden Gophers football games as a part of a new deal between CBS and the Big Ten Conference.

===News operation===
WCCO presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and three hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). WCCO leads the Twin Cities market in nearly all time slots, from its morning show to the 10 p.m. news. WCCO leads by large margins in overall households, though compared to the 25–54 demographic, the numbers are much more competitive with NBC affiliate KARE.

WCCO began broadcasting local newscasts in high-definition on May 28, 2009, becoming the third major network station in the Twin Cities (behind KARE and KMSP) to do so.

WCCO-TV launched a streaming news service, CBSN Minnesota (now CBS News Minnesota) on December 12, 2019, as part of a rollout of similar services (each a localized version of the national CBSN service across the CBS-owned stations).

On September 5, 2022, WCCO premiered an hour-long 4 pm newscast called &quot;The 4&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WCCO-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 32, using virtual channel 4.

As part of the SAFER Act, WCCO-TV kept its analog signal on the air until July 12 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

===Satellite stations and translators===
WCCO-TV operates a satellite station northwest of the Twin Cities area:

It formerly operated a second satellite station:
Both of these stations were founded by the Central Minnesota Television Company and maintained primary affiliations with NBC and secondary affiliations with ABC from their respective sign-ons until the summer of 1982, when both stations switched to CBS. KCMT had originally broadcast from a studio in Alexandria, with KNMT operating as a satellite station of KCMT. Central Minnesota Television sold both stations to Midwest Radio and Television in 1987, at which point they adopted their present call letters and became semi-satellites of WCCO-TV.

Until 2002, the two stations simulcast WCCO-TV&#x27;s programming for most of the day, except for separate commercials and inserts placed into channel 4&#x27;s newscasts. However, in 2002, WCCO-TV ended KCCO/KCCW&#x27;s local operations and shut down the Alexandria studio, converting the two stations into full-time satellites. Since then, channel 4 has identified as &quot;Minneapolis–St. Paul/Alexandria/Walker&quot;, with virtually no on-air evidence that KCCO and KCCW were separate stations.

CBS sold KCCO&#x27;s spectrum in the FCC&#x27;s spectrum incentive auction, but was expected to engage in a channel-sharing agreement. In a request for a waiver of requirements that KCCO broadcast public service announcements related to the shutdown (as the station no longer had the capability to originate separate programming, such announcements would also need to air on WCCO-TV and KCCW-TV despite not being relevant outside of KCCO&#x27;s viewing area; CBS inserted a crawl at the KCCO transmitter for broadcast every fifteen minutes), CBS disclosed that KCCO would shut down December 30, 2017. WCCO-TV remains available on cable and satellite providers in the Alexandria area; Selective TV, Inc., a local translator collective, announced on December 22, 2017, that it had struck a deal to add WCCO to its lineup.

====Translators====
In addition, the broadcast signal of WCCO-TV is extended by way of eight translators:
* Alexandria (translates WCCO-TV)
* Alexandria (translates WCCO-TV)
* Frost (translates WCCO-TV)
* Jackson (translates WCCO-TV)
* Olivia (translates WCCO-TV)
* Red Lake (translates KCCW-TV)
* Redwood Falls (translates WCCO-TV)
* Willmar (translates WCCO-TV)

<doc id="521871" wikidata="Q618292" url="?curid=521871" title="Treaty of Aigun">
<text>The Treaty of Aigun was an 1858 treaty between the Russian Empire and Yishan, official of the Qing dynasty of China. It established much of the modern border between the Russian Far East and China by ceding much of Manchuria (the ancestral homeland of the Manchu people), now known as Northeast China. Negotiations began after China was threatened with war on a second front by Governor-General of the Far East Nikolay Muraviev when China was suppressing the Taiping Rebellion. It reversed the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) by transferring the land between the Stanovoy Range and the Amur River from the Qing dynasty to the Russian Empire. Russia received over of what became known as Outer Manchuria. While the Qing government initially refused to recognize the validity of the treaty, the Russian gains under the Treaty of Aigun were affirmed as part of the 1860 Sino-Russian Convention of Peking.

==Background==
Since the reign of Catherine the Great (1762–1796), Russian emperors had desired to make Russia a naval power in the Pacific. They gradually achieved their goals by annexing the Kamchatka Peninsula and establishing the naval outpost of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in 1740, naval outposts in Russian America and near the Amur watershed, encouraging Russians to go there and settle, and slowly developing a strong military presence in the Amur region. 

From 1850 to 1864, when China was heavily involved in suppressing the Taiping Rebellion, and Governor-General of the Far East Nikolay Muraviev camped tens of thousands of troops on the borders of Mongolia and Manchuria, preparing to make legal Russian de facto control over the Amur from past settlement. Muraviev seized the opportunity when it was clear that China was losing the Second Opium War, and threatened China with a war on a second front. The Qing dynasty agreed to enter negotiations with Russia.

==Signing==
The Russian general Muraviev and the Qing official Yishan, both military governors of the area, signed the treaty on May 28, 1858, in the town of Aigun. The Qing government initially refused to ratify the treaty and considered the treaty invalid, but in 1860 the Sino-Russian Convention of Peking affirmed Russian gains under the Treaty of Aigun and also ceded Primorye and the Ussuri region to the Russians.

==Effects==
The resulting treaty established a border between the Russian and Chinese Empires along the Amur River. (Chinese and Manchu residents of the Sixty-Four Villages East of the River would be allowed to remain, under the jurisdiction of Manchu government.) The Amur, Sungari, and Ussuri rivers were to be open exclusively to both Chinese and Russian ships. The territory bounded on the west by the Ussuri, on the north by the Amur, and on the east and south by the Sea of Japan was to be jointly administered by Russia and China—a &quot;condominium&quot; arrangement similar to that which the British and Americans had agreed upon for the Oregon Territory in the Treaty of 1818. (Russia gained sole control of this land two years later.)
#The inhabitants along the Amur, Sungari, and Ussuri rivers were to be allowed to trade with each other.
#The Russians would retain Russian and Manchu copies of the text, and the Chinese would retain Manchu and Mongolian copies of the text.
#All restrictions on trade to be lifted along the border.

==Perception in China==
In China, especially after the rise of Chinese nationalism in the 1920s, the treaty has been denounced as an unequal treaty.

In September 2024, the President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Lai Ching-te claimed that if China&#x27;s claims on Taiwan are about territorial integrity then it should also take back land from Russia signed over by the last Chinese dynasty in the 19th century, mentioning the treaty.

<doc id="521877" wikidata="Q407924" url="?curid=521877" title="Sodium hydride">
<text>Sodium hydride is the chemical compound with the empirical formula NaH. This alkali metal hydride is primarily used as a strong yet combustible base in organic synthesis. NaH is a saline (salt-like) hydride, composed of Na+ and H− ions, in contrast to molecular hydrides such as borane, silane, germane, ammonia, and methane. It is an ionic material that is insoluble in all solvents (other than molten sodium metal), consistent with the fact that H− ions do not exist in solution.

==Basic properties and structure==
NaH is colorless, although samples generally appear grey. NaH is around 40% denser than Na (0.968 g/cm3).

NaH, like LiH, KH, RbH, and CsH, adopts the NaCl crystal structure. In this motif, each Na+ ion is surrounded by six H− centers in an octahedral geometry. The ionic radii of H− (146 pm in NaH) and F− (133 pm) are comparable, as judged by the Na−H and Na−F distances.

===&quot;Inverse sodium hydride&quot; (hydrogen sodide) ===
A very unusual situation occurs in a compound dubbed &quot;inverse sodium hydride&quot;, which contains H+ and Na− ions. Na− is an alkalide, and this compound differs from ordinary sodium hydride in having a much higher energy content due to the net displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium. A derivative of this &quot;inverse sodium hydride&quot; arises in the presence of the base [36]adamanzane. This molecule irreversibly encapsulates the H+ and shields it from interaction with the alkalide Na−. Theoretical work has suggested that even an unprotected protonated tertiary amine complexed with the sodium alkalide might be metastable under certain solvent conditions, though the barrier to reaction would be small and finding a suitable solvent might be difficult.

== Preparation ==
Industrially, NaH is prepared by introducing molten sodium into mineral oil with hydrogen at atmospheric pressure and mixed vigorously at ~8000 rpm. The reaction is especially rapid at 250−300 °C.
The resultant suspension of NaH in mineral oil is often directly used, such as in the production of diborane.

==Applications in organic synthesis==

===As a strong base===
NaH is a base of wide scope and utility in organic chemistry. As a superbase, it is capable of deprotonating a range of even weak Brønsted acids to give the corresponding sodium derivatives. Typical &quot;easy&quot; substrates contain O-H, N-H, S-H bonds, including alcohols, phenols, pyrazoles, and thiols.

NaH notably deprotonates carbon acids (i.e., C-H bonds) such as 1,3-dicarbonyls such as malonic esters. The resulting sodium derivatives can be alkylated. NaH is widely used to promote condensation reactions of carbonyl compounds via the Dieckmann condensation, Stobbe condensation, Darzens condensation, and Claisen condensation. Other carbon acids susceptible to deprotonation by NaH include sulfonium salts and DMSO. NaH is used to make sulfur ylides, which in turn are used to convert ketones into epoxides, as in the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction.

===As a reducing agent===
NaH reduces certain main group compounds, but analogous reactivity is very rare in organic chemistry (&quot;see below&quot;). Notably boron trifluoride reacts to give diborane and sodium fluoride:

:6 NaH + 2 BF3 → B2H6 + 6 NaF

Si–Si and S–S bonds in disilanes and disulfides are also reduced.

A series of reduction reactions, including the hydrodecyanation of tertiary nitriles, reduction of imines to amines, and amides to aldehydes, can be effected by a composite reagent composed of sodium hydride and an alkali metal iodide (NaH⋅MI, M = Li, Na).

===Hydrogen storage===
Although not commercially significant sodium hydride has been proposed for hydrogen storage for use in fuel cell vehicles. In one experimental implementation, plastic pellets containing NaH are crushed in the presence of water to release the hydrogen. One challenge with this technology is the regeneration of NaH from the NaOH formed by hydrolysis.

==Practical considerations==
Sodium hydride is sold as a mixture of 60% sodium hydride (w/w) in mineral oil. Such a dispersion is safer to handle and weigh than pure NaH. The compound is often used in this form but the pure grey solid can be prepared by rinsing the commercial product with pentane or tetrahydrofuran, with care being taken because the waste solvent will contain traces of NaH and can ignite in air. Reactions involving NaH usually require air-free techniques.

==Safety==
NaH can ignite spontaneously in air. It also reacts vigorously with water or humid air to release hydrogen, which is very flammable, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a quite corrosive base. In practice, most sodium hydride is sold as a dispersion in mineral oil, which can be safely handled in air. Although sodium hydride is widely used in DMSO, DMF or DMAc for SN2 type reactions there have been many cases of fires and/or explosions from such mixtures.

<text>Emergency Government Headquarters is the name given for a system of nuclear fallout shelters built by the Government of Canada in the 1950s and 1960s as part of continuity of government planning at the height of the Cold War. Situated at strategic locations across the country, the largest of these shelters are popularly referred to as &quot;Diefenbunkers&quot;, a nickname coined by federal opposition politicians during the early 1960s. The nickname was derived from the last name of the Prime Minister of the day, John Diefenbaker, who authorized their construction. Over fifty facilities were built along several designs for various classes of service.

Most of these facilities were built, often in great secrecy, at rural locations outside major cities across Canada. The majority of the larger facilities were two-storey underground bunkers while the largest at CFS Carp had four floors; these facilities were designed to withstand a near-miss from a nuclear explosion. Each underground facility had entrances through massive blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters and positive air pressure to prevent radiation infiltration. Underground storage was built for food, fuel, fresh water, and other supplies for the facilities which were capable of supporting several dozen people for a period of several weeks. The facilities were operated by personnel from the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals, renamed to Communications Command after the 1968 unification of the Canadian Armed Forces.

==Terminology==
==Facilities==

==Decommissioning and legacy==
Following the end of the Cold War, all but one of the Diefenbunkers have been decommissioned and either covered over, demolished or sold. Only the facility located at CFB Valcartier remains in use, as an itinerant accommodation barracks.

The two Diefenbunkers which members of the public may visit are located at former CFS Carp in Ontario and CFS Debert. CFS Carp was decommissioned in 1994 and has been converted into a year-round museum dedicated to the history of the Cold War. CFS Debert in Nova Scotia was open for tours for the decade following its closure in 1994 as part of a local military museum. It was later used for summer accommodation for an air cadet gliding school. In 2009, it was sold and then resold for use as a secure data storage facility. In 2018, CFS Debert reopened to the public, featuring historical tours, escape rooms, laser tag, special events, and more. In 2019, the present owner of the Diefenbunker at former CFS Debert purchased the neighbouring NATO building. The plans for the NATO building are currently unknown.

The Diefenbunker that was located at former CFS Penhold in Alberta was decommissioned in 1994. It was sold to a pair of businessmen from Red Deer in 1995 for CA$472,000 (). Members of the Hells Angels, a criminal outlaw motorcycle gang, in addition to a group of white supremacists and a car theft group from Miami, were also rumoured to have been interested in purchasing the bunker; the businessmen later claimed the Hells Angels had offered them CA$1.3 million for it. However, the government repurchased the building in 1998 for CA$1.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in addition to $100,000 in disbursement fees due to potential security risks; they had the shelter demolished in 2001.

A &quot;Toronto Star&quot; report in February 2020 discussed another nuclear bunker, intended for the politicians of Toronto, Ontario, built during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Located in a home on Old Yonge St. in Aurora, Ontario and still in place, this concrete-reinforced room was intended &quot;to serve as a control centre to house Toronto politicians and emergency personnel in the event of a nuclear attack&quot;. According to the report, the bunker includes maps, status boards for recording casualties, one hundred telephone lines, water tanks and an escape route.

==In popular culture==

The film &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; has a scene that was shot on location in the Diefenbunker at former CFS Carp. The scene consisted of the President of the United States, James Cromwell, and his political advisors performing a war game scenario.

The finale of the second season of &quot;The Amazing Race Canada&quot; featured a task completed at the Diefenbunker at former CFS Carp. One member of each team had to search among the bunker&#x27;s vast array of rooms for three of five hidden souvenirs: a helicopter, a tank, a jeep, a plane, and a compass.

<doc id="521884" wikidata="Q212235" url="?curid=521884" title="American International Group">
<text>American International Group, Inc. (AIG) is an American multinational finance and insurance corporation with operations in more than 80 countries and jurisdictions. As of 2023, AIG employed 25,200 people. The company operates through three core businesses: general insurance, life &amp; retirement, and a standalone technology-enabled subsidiary. General Insurance includes Commercial, Personal Insurance, U.S. and International field operations. Life &amp; Retirement includes Group Retirement, Individual Retirement, Life, and Institutional Markets.
AIG is the title sponsor of the AIG Women&#x27;s Open golf tournament. In 2023, for the sixth consecutive year, DiversityInc named AIG among the Top 50 Companies for Diversity list.

AIG&#x27;s corporate headquarters are in New York City and the company also has offices around the world. AIG serves 87% of the Fortune Global 500 and 83% of the Forbes 2000. AIG was ranked 60th on the 2018 Fortune 500 list. According to the 2016 Forbes Global 2000 list, AIG is the 87th largest public company in the world. On December 31, 2017, AIG had $65.2 billion (~$ in ) in shareholder equity.

During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve bailed the company out for $180 billion and assumed controlling ownership stake, with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission correlating AIG&#x27;s failure with the mass sales of unhedged insurance. AIG repaid $205 billion (~$ in ) to the United States government in 2012.

==History==

===1919–1945: early years===

AIG was founded December 19, 1919 when American Cornelius Vander Starr (1892–1968) established a general insurance agency, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), in Shanghai, China. Business grew rapidly, and two years later, Starr formed a life insurance operation. By the late 1920s, AAU had branches throughout China and Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In 1926, Starr opened his first office in the United States, American International Underwriters Corporation (AIU). He also focused on opportunities in Latin America and, in the late 1930s, AIU entered Havana, Cuba. The steady growth of the Latin American agencies proved significant as it would offset the decline in business from Asia due to the impending World War II. In 1939, Starr moved his headquarters from Shanghai, China, to New York City.

===1945–1959: international and domestic expansion===

After World War II, American International Underwriters (AIU) entered Japan and Germany, to provide insurance for American military personnel. Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, AIU continued to expand in Europe, with offices opening in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. In 1952, Starr began to focus on the American market by acquiring Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Insurance Company and its subsidiary, American Home Fire Assurance Company. By the end of the decade, C.V. Starr&#x27;s general and life insurance organization included an extensive network of agents and offices in over 75 countries.

===1959–1979: reorganization and specialization===

In 1960, C.V. Starr hired Hank Greenberg to develop an international accident and health business. Two years later, Greenberg reorganized one of C.V. Starr&#x27;s U.S. holdings into a successful multiple line carrier. Greenberg focused on selling insurance through independent brokers rather than agents to eliminate agent salaries. Using brokers, AIU could price insurance according to its potential return even if it suffered decreased sales of certain products for great lengths of time with very little extra expense. In 1967, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) was incorporated as a unifying umbrella organization for most of C.V. Starr&#x27;s general and life insurance businesses. In 1968, Starr named Greenberg his successor. The company went public in 1969.

The 1970s presented many challenges for AIG as operations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia were curtailed or ceased altogether due to the changing political landscape. However, AIG continued to expand its markets by introducing specialized energy, transportation, and shipping products to serve the needs of niche industries.

===1979–2000: new opportunities and directions===

During the 1980s, AIG continued expanding its market distribution and worldwide network by offering a wide range of specialized products, including pollution liability and political risk. In 1984, AIG listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Throughout the 1990s, AIG developed new sources of income through diverse investments, including the acquisition of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a provider of leased aircraft to the airline industry. In 1992, AIG received the first foreign insurance license granted in over 40 years by the Chinese government. Within the U.S., AIG acquired SunAmerica Inc. a retirement savings company managed by Eli Broad, in 1999.

===2000–2012: further expansion and decline===

====Growth====

The early 2000s saw a marked period of growth as AIG acquired American General Corporation, a leading domestic life insurance and annuities provider, and AIG entered new markets including India. In February 2000, AIG created a strategic advisory venture team with the Blackstone Group and Kissinger Associates &quot;to provide financial advisory services to corporations seeking high level independent strategic advice&quot;. AIG was an investor in Blackstone from 1998 to March 2012, when it sold all of its shares in the company. Blackstone acted as an adviser for AIG during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

In March 2003 American General merged with Old Line Life Insurance Company.

In the early 2000s, AIG made significant investments in Russia as the country recovered from the 1998 Russian financial crisis. In July 2003, Maurice Greenberg met with Putin to discuss AIG&#x27;s investments and improving U.S.-Russia economic ties, in anticipation of Putin&#x27;s meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush later that year.&quot;

In November 2004, AIG reached a $126 million (~$ in ) settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department partly resolving a number of regulatory matters, and the company needed to continue to cooperate with investigators continuing to probe the sale of a non-traditional insurance product.

====Accounting scandal====

In 2005, AIG became embroiled in a series of fraud investigations conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Justice Department, and New York State Attorney General&#x27;s Office. Greenberg was ousted amid an accounting scandal in February 2005. The New York Attorney General&#x27;s investigation led to a $1.6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives.

On May 1, 2005, investigations conducted by outside counsel at the request of AIG&#x27;s Audit Committee and the consultation with AIG&#x27;s independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP resulted in AIG&#x27;s decision to restate its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, 2001 and 2000, the quarters ended March 31, June 30 and September 30, 2004, and 2003 and the quarter ended December 31, 2003.
On November 9, 2005, the company was said to have delayed its third-quarter earnings report because it had to restate earlier financial results, to correct accounting errors.

====Expansion to the credit default insurance market====

Martin J. Sullivan became CEO of the company in 2005. He began his career at AIG as a clerk in its London office in 1970. AIG then took on tens of billions of dollars of risk associated with mortgages. It insured tens of billions of dollars of derivatives against default, but did not purchase reinsurance to hedge that risk. Secondly, it used collateral on deposit to buy mortgage-backed securities. When losses hit the mortgage market in 2007–2008, AIG had to pay out insurance claims and also replace the losses in its collateral accounts.

AIG purchased the remaining 39% that it did not own of online auto insurance specialist 21st Century Insurance in 2007 for $749 million. With the failure of the parent company and the continuing recession in late 2008, AIG rebranded its insurance unit to 21st Century Insurance.

On June 11, 2008, three stockholders, collectively owning 4% of the outstanding stock of AIG, delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of AIG seeking to oust CEO Martin Sullivan and make certain other management and Board of Directors changes.

On June 15, 2008, after disclosure of financial losses and subsequent to a falling stock price, Sullivan resigned and was replaced by Robert B. Willumstad, Chairman of the AIG Board of Directors since 2006. Willumstad was forced by the US government to step down and was replaced by Ed Liddy on September 17, 2008. AIG&#x27;s board of directors named Bob Benmosche CEO on August 3, 2009, to replace Liddy, who earlier in the year announced his retirement.

====2008 liquidity crisis and government bailout====
In late 2008, the federal government bailed out AIG for $180 billion, and technically assumed control, because many believed its failure would endanger the financial integrity of other major firms that were its trading partners--Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, as well as dozens of European banks. In January 2011, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission issued one of many critical governmental reports, deciding that AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure, which one analyst considered a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices. Other analysts believed AIG&#x27;s failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products, including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG&#x27;s failure.

Illustrating the danger of an AIG bankruptcy, a September 17, 2008, &quot;CNN Money&quot; article stated, &quot;But in AIG&#x27;s case, the situation is even more serious. The company is much larger and complex than Lehman Brothers and its assets hitting the market all at once would likely cause worldwide chaos and send values plummeting. Experts question whether there are even enough qualified buyers out there to digest the company and its subsidiaries.&quot;

AIG had sold credit protection through its London unit in the form of credit default swaps (CDSs) on collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) but by 2008, they had declined in value. AIG&#x27;s Financial Products division, headed by Joseph Cassano in London, had entered into credit default swaps to insure $441 billion worth of securities originally rated AAA. Of those securities, $57.8 billion were structured debt securities backed by subprime loans. As a result, AIG&#x27;s credit rating was downgraded and it was required to post additional collateral with its trading counter-parties, leading to a liquidity crisis that began on September 16, 2008, and essentially bankrupted all of AIG. The New York United States Federal Reserve Bank (led by Timothy Geithner who would later become Treasury secretary) stepped in, announcing creation of a secured credit facility, initially of up to $85 billion to prevent the company&#x27;s collapse, enabling AIG to deliver additional collateral to its credit default swap trading partners. The credit facility was secured by the stock in AIG-owned subsidiaries in the form of warrants for a 79.9% equity stake in the company and the right to suspend dividends to previously issued common and preferred stock. The AIG board accepted the terms of the Federal Reserve rescue package that same day, making it the largest government bailout of a private company in U.S. history.

In March 2009, AIG compounded public cynicism concerning the &quot;too big to fail&quot; firm&#x27;s bailout by announcing that it would pay its executives over $165 million in executive bonuses. Total bonuses for the financial unit could reach $450 million, and bonuses for the entire company could reach $1.2 billion. Newly inaugurated President Barack Obama, who had voted for TARP as a Senator responded to the planned payments by saying &quot;[I]t&#x27;s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?&quot; Both Democratic and Republican politicians reacted with similar outrage to the planned bonuses, as did political commentators and journalists in the AIG bonus payments controversy.

AIG began selling some assets to pay off its government loans in September 2008 despite a global decline in the valuation of insurance businesses, and the weakening financial condition of potential bidders. In December 2009, AIG formed international life insurance subsidiaries, American International Assurance Company, Limited (AIA) and American Life Insurance Company (ALICO), which were transferred to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to reduce its debt by $25 billion. AIG sold its Hartford Steam Boiler unit on March 31, 2009, to Munich Re for $742 million. On April 16, 2009, AIG announced plans to sell its 21st Century Insurance subsidiary to Farmers Insurance Group for $1.9 billion. In June 2009 AIG sold its majority ownership of reinsurer Transatlantic Re. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on September 7, 2009, that Pacific Century Group had agreed to pay $500 million for a part of AIG&#x27;s asset management business, and that they also expected to pay an additional $200 million to AIG in carried interest and other payments linked to future performance of the business.

AIG then sold its American Life Insurance Co. (ALICO) to MetLife Inc. for $15.5 billion in cash and MetLife stock in March 2010. Bloomberg L.P. reported on March 29, 2010, that after almost three months of delays, AIG had completed the $500 million sale of a portion of its asset management business, branded PineBridge Investments, to the Asia-based Pacific Century Group. Fortress Investment Group purchased 80% of the interest in financing company American General Finance in August 2010. In September 2010 AIG sold AIG Starr and AIG Edison, two of its Japan-based companies, to Prudential Financial for $4.2 billion in cash and $600 million in assumption of third party AIG debt by Prudential. On November 1, 2010, AIG raised $36.71 billion from both the sale of ALICO and its IPO of AIA. Proceeds went to repay some of the aid it received from the government during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

AIG sold its Taiwanese life insurance company Nan Shan Life to a consortium of buyers for $2.16 billion in January 2011. Due to the Q3 2011 net loss widening, on November 3, 2011, AIG shares plunged 49 percent year to date. The insurer&#x27;s board approved a share buyback of as much as $1 billion.

Nine years after the initial bailout, in 2017, the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council removed AIG from its list of too-big-to-fail institutions.

===2012–2016: modern era===
The United States Department of the Treasury announced an offering of 188.5 million shares of AIG for a total of $5.8 billion on May 7, 2012. The sale reduced Treasury&#x27;s stake in AIG to 61 percent, from 70 percent before the transaction. Four months later, on September 6, 2012, AIG sold $2 billion of its investment in AIA to repay government loans. The board also approved a $5 billion stock repurchase of government-owned shares in AIA. The next week, on September 14, 2012, the Department of Treasury completed its fifth sale of AIG common stock, with proceeds of approximately $20.7 billion, reducing the Treasury&#x27;s ownership stake in AIG to approximately 15.9 percent from 53 percent. Government commitments were fully recovered, and Treasury and the FRBNY to date had received a combined positive return of approximately $15.1 billion.

On October 12, 2012, AIG announced a five and a half year agreement to sponsor six New Zealand–based rugby teams, including the world champion All Blacks. The AIG logo and the Adidas logo, the league&#x27;s primary sponsor, were displayed on the league&#x27;s team jerseys.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2012 published an itemized list of the loans, stock purchases, special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and other investments engaged in with AIG, the amount AIG paid back and the positive return on the loans and investments to the government. The Treasury said that it and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provided a total $182.3 billion to AIG, which paid back a total $205 billion, for a total positive return, or profit, to the government of $22.7 billion. In addition, AIG sold off a number of its own assets to raise money to pay back the government. On December 14, 2012, the Treasury Department sold the last of its AIG stock in its sixth stock sale for a total of approximately $7.6 billion. In total, the Treasury Department realized a gain of more than $22 billion from the sale of AIG common stock and $0.9 billion from the sale of AIG preferred stock. The same month, Robert Benmosche announced that he would be stepping down from his position as president and CEO due to his advancing lung cancer.

AIG began an advertising campaign on January 1, 2013, called &quot;Thank You America,&quot; in which several company employees, including AIG President and CEO Robert Benmosche, talked directly to the camera and offered their thanks for the government assistance. Peter Hancock succeeded Benmosche as president and CEO of AIG in September 2014. While Benmosche stayed on in an advisory role, he died in February the following year.

In June 2015, Taiwan&#x27;s Nan Shan Life Insurance acquired a stake in AIG&#x27;s subsidiary in Taiwan for a fee of $158 million. Later that year, activist investor Carl Icahn called for a breakup of AIG, describing the company as &quot;too big to succeed&quot;. AIG announced plans for an initial public offering of 19.9 percent of United Guaranty Corp., a Greensboro, North Carolina–based provider of mortgage insurance for lenders in January 2016. Later that year, Icahn won a seat on the board of directors and continued to pressure the company to split up its major divisions. AIG also began a joint venture with Hamilton Insurance Group and Two Sigma Investments to serve the insurance needs of small- to medium-sized enterprises. Industry veteran Brian Duperreault became the chairman of the new entity, and Richard Friesenhahn, the executive vice president of U.S. casualty lines at AIG, became CEO. In August 2016, AIG sold off United Guaranty, its mortgage-guarantee unit, to Arch Capital Group, a Bermuda-based insurer, for $3.4 billion.

===2017===
Brian Duperreault was appointed CEO of AIG on May 15, 2017. Duperreault, who previously worked at AIG from 1973 until 1994, was hired as CEO from Hamilton Insurance Group following Hancock&#x27;s announcement in March 2017 that he would step down as AIG CEO under pressure after a period of disappointing financial results. Due to previous calls in 2015 and 2016 to shrink or break up AIG, Duperreault announced his intention to grow AIG and maintain its multiline structure as a provider of life and retirement solutions and non-life insurance, outlining a strategy to focus on technology, &quot;underwriting discipline,&quot; and diversification.

2017 through early 2019 saw AIG hire a number of new upper level executives. In 2017, Duperreault named Peter Zaffino as AIG COO, later also naming him CEO of AIG&#x27;s General Insurance business. Zaffino succeeded Duperreault as president of AIG in January 2020, with Duperreault remaining AIG&#x27;s CEO. The company announced plans in 2017 to reorganize its Commercial and Consumer segments into General Insurance and Life &amp; Retirement, respectively. In September 2017, the Financial Stability Oversight Council determined that AIG was no longer considered a nonbank systemically important financial institution (SIFI). Duperreault commented in response that the development reflected &quot;the progress made since 2008 to de-risk the company.&quot;

===2018–2023===
AIG made a number of acquisitions in 2018. That July, AIG acquired Validus Holdings Ltd., a provider of reinsurance based in Bermuda. The company was also a Lloyd&#x27;s of London syndicate, involved in insurance-linked securities, a specialist in US small commercial excess and surplus underwriting, and a provider of crop insurance. The deal &quot;brought in fresh underwriting talent,&quot; particularly in property risk and catastrophe risk. Also in 2018 AIG acquired Ellipse, a UK life insurance business, from Munich Re. In 2018, AIG established Fortitude Re to hold most of its run-off portfolios and late in 2018 sold a minority stake to The Carlyle Group. In November 2019, a Carlyle-managed fund and T&amp;D Holdings acquired a majority interest in Fortitude Re, leaving AIG with a 3.5% stake &quot;subject to required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.&quot;

Duperreault and Zaffino set out a turnaround strategy for the General Insurance business in 2017 and began execution. In 2019, Duperreault stated that the new executive team had restructured the business, implemented new risk and underwriting guidelines, and &quot;overhauled its reinsurance buying strategy.&quot;

In 2019, Duperreault and Zaffino announced &quot;AIG 200&quot;, a multi-year program to improve operations by shedding legacy processes and excess manual interventions, modernizing and digitizing workflows, and unifying operations. Also during that month, AIG reported its second consecutive quarter of underwriting profits, and AIG&#x27;s Life and Retirement business, led by CEO Kevin Hogan, delivered &quot;solid growth&quot; and returns despite a volatile credit and equity market. In January 2020, AIG announced it was ending its decade-long sponsorship of the All Blacks in 2021.

On March 1, 2021, Peter Zaffino succeeded Brian Duperreault as AIG&#x27;s CEO, with Duperreault becoming executive chairman of the board. Then, in January 2022, Zaffino also became chairman of the AIG board.

As part of AIG&#x27;s 2020 plan to form an independent company of its life and retirement insurance business with a 2022 IPO, the company announced, in July 2021, that Blackstone Group would acquire 9.9% of the new unit for $2.2 billion cash. Blackstone and AIG also entered a long-term asset management agreement for about one quarter of AIG&#x27;s life and retirement portfolio, set to increase in subsequent years. After the spin-off, Corebridge Financial became an independent entity, raising $1.68 billion in the largest U.S. IPO of 2022.

In February 2023, AIG and Stone Point Capital entered into an agreement to establish an independent managing general agency and relocate AIG&#x27;s current private client group to the independent new company, Private Client Select Insurance Services (PCS). That May, AIG agreed to sell subsidiary Crop Risk Services to American Financial Group for $240 million, as well as Validus Re, including AlphaCat and the Talbot Treaty reinsurance business, to RenaissanceRe for $2.985 billion, in cash and RenaissanceRe common shares.

===2024===

In March 2024, British regulators cleared the sale of the UK arm of AIG Life Ltd to British insurer Aviva for £460 million.

== Business ==
In Australia and China, AIG is identified as a large financial institution and provider of financial services including credit security mechanisms. In the United States, AIG is the largest underwriter of commercial and industrial insurance.

AIG offers property casualty insurance, life insurance, retirement products, mortgage insurance and other financial services. In the third quarter of 2012, the global property-and-casualty insurance business, Chartis, was renamed AIG Property Casualty. SunAmerica, life-insurance and retirement-services division, was renamed AIG Life and Retirement; other existing brands continue to be used in certain geographies and market segments.

== Sponsorships ==
AIG was the shirt sponsor of the English football club Manchester United F.C. between 2006 and 2010. AIG was the first American shirt sponsor of the club and AIG shirts were worn for one of the most concentrated periods of success in the club&#x27;s history, coinciding with Sir Alex Ferguson&#x27;s third great United team, which won three Premier League titles, as well as the Champions League, in the space of four seasons.

In 2019, AIG signed a five-year contract to be the title sponsor of Women&#x27;s British Open, its first deal in golf. In 2020, the contract was extended to 2025 and the championship was rebranded as the AIG Women&#x27;s Open, with the largest major women&#x27;s golf prize fund in 2021, totaling $US5.8 million. The AIG Women&#x27;s Open set a new benchmark in 2022 of $7.3 million for women&#x27;s major championship golf prize payouts, increasing the tournament&#x27;s purse 125% since 2018.
In 2023, AIG announced it will continue as the title sponsor of the event through 2030, along with another increase in the total purse to $9 million.

== Bailout litigation ==

* Starr International Co v U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals
Hank Greenberg, with lead lawyer David Boies, independently sued the U.S. Government for $40 billion (US) in the United States Court of Federal Claims in 2011. In &quot;Starr v. United States,&quot; the plaintiffs argued that the government denied AIG access to discounted federal loans that would have enabled the company to pay off creditors; instead, AIG was forced to pay a high interest rate and hand the government an 80 percent equity stake in the company. The AIG board had announced on January 9 that the company would not join the lawsuit. In his opening, David Boies called the United States&#x27; demand for a 79.9% equity stake a &quot;grab&quot; at &quot;an extortion rate.&quot; In response, government lawyer Kenneth Dintzer sought to paint Mr. Greenberg and the A.I.G. shareholders as ingrates with a sense of “entitlement” that &quot;knows no bounds.&quot; The trial lasted thirty-seven days and included testimony from Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, and former Secretaries of the Treasury Timothy Geithner, Henry Paulson. Former secretary Paulson testified that the terms of the bail out were meant to be punative. After closing arguments by Boies and Dintzer, Judge Thomas C. Wheeler ruled that the terms of the Federal Reserve loan to AIG had been an illegal exaction, as the Federal Reserve Act did not authorize the New York Fed to nationalize a corporation by owning its stock. Judge Wheeler did not award compensation to the plaintiffs, ruling that they did not suffer economic damage because &quot;if the government had done nothing, the shareholders would have been left with 100 percent of nothing.&quot; 

Greenberg and the U.S. Government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled that Greenberg had no legal right to challenge the bailout because that right belonged to AIG, which in this case, chose not to sue.
* AIG Inc. et al. v. Maiden Lane II LLC
AIG filed suit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in January 2013 in order to maintain the former&#x27;s right to sue Bank of America and other issuers of bad mortgage debt. The specific issue was whether the Federal Reserve Bank of New York transferred $18 billion in litigation claims on troubled mortgage debt through Maiden Lane Transactions, entities created by the Fed in 2008. This transaction, AIG argued, prevented them from recouping losses from insured banks. Owing to events which allowed AIG to proceed in another related case, &quot;AIG Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation LLC&quot;, AIG withdrew the Maiden Lane case &quot;without prejudice&quot; on May 28, 2013.
* AIG Inc. v. Bank of America Corporation LLC
On May 7, 2013, Los Angeles U.S. District Judge, Mariana Pfaelzer, ruled in a case between AIG and Bank of America concerning possible misrepresentations by Merrill Lynch and Countrywide as to the quality of the mortgage portfolio, that $7.3 billion of the disputed claims had not been assigned. The two parties settled in July 2014, with Bank of America paying out $650 million to AIG, who in turn dismissed their litigation.

<text>The voiced alveolar, dental and postalveolar plosives (or stops) are types of consonantal sounds used in many spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents voiced dental, alveolar, and postalveolar plosives is (although the symbol can be used to distinguish the dental plosive, and the postalveolar), and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

There are only a few languages that distinguish dental and alveolar stops, among them Kota, Toda, Venda and some Irish dialects.

==Features==
Features of the voiced alveolar stop:
* There are three specific variants of :
** Dental, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the upper teeth, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.
** Denti-alveolar, which means it is articulated with the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, and the tip of the tongue behind upper teeth.
** Alveolar, which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge, termed respectively &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;laminal&quot;.

The Kaitaba Stadium is also found in south east of Bukoba on Jamhuri Road. The stadium has the capacity of 15000 people and supports football games day and night.

== Climate ==
Bukoba has an upland tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Amb&quot;, because every month has a normal mean temperature of between 18 °C and 22 °C) although it is milder than most climates with that classification due to its altitude. It can sometimes get cool especially in the evenings during the two rainy seasons, but never as cold as the winter season in Europe.

<doc id="521911" wikidata="Q696094" url="?curid=521911" title="Treaty of Nerchinsk">
<text>The Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689 was the first treaty between the Tsardom of Russia and the Qing dynasty of China after the defeat of Russia by Qing China at the Siege of Albazin in 1686. The Russians gave up the area north of the Amur River as far as the Stanovoy Range and kept the area between the Argun River and Lake Baikal. This border along the Argun River and Stanovoy Range lasted until the Amur Annexation via the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Convention of Peking in 1860. It opened markets for Russian goods in China, and gave Russians access to Chinese supplies and luxuries.

The agreement was signed in Nerchinsk on 27 August 1689. The signatories were Songgotu on behalf of the Kangxi Emperor and Fyodor Golovin on behalf of the Russian tsars Peter I and Ivan V.

The authoritative version was in Latin, with translations into Russian and Manchu, but these versions differed considerably. There was no official Chinese text for another two centuries, but the border markers were inscribed in Chinese along with Manchu, Russian and Latin.

Later, in 1727, the Treaty of Kiakhta reconfirmed and expanded upon the treaty. The treaty further set what is now the border of Mongolia west of the Argun and opened up the caravan trade. In 1858 (Treaty of Aigun) Russia annexed the land north of the Amur and in 1860 (Treaty of Beijing) took the coast down to Vladivostok. The current border runs along the Argun, Amur and Ussuri rivers.

==Names==
Treaty of Nerchinsk is written in other languages as follows: 
* (transliteration: &quot;Nerčinskij dogovor&quot;)
*Manchu: , (Möllendorff transliteration: &quot;nibcu-i boji bithe&quot;)

==History==
From about 1640, Russians entered the Amur basin from the north, into land claimed by the Qing dynasty which at this time were just beginning their conquest of the Ming dynasty. The Qing had, by the 1680s, completed the conquest of China proper and eliminated the last Ming successor states in the south. With the Qing dynasty now firmly in control of China, it was in a position to deal with what they saw as Russian encroachment in Manchuria, the ancient homeland of the ruling Aisin Gioro clan. By 1685 most of the Russians had been driven out of the area.

After their first victory at Albazin in 1685, the Qing government sent two letters to the Tsar (in Latin) suggesting peace and demanding that Russian freebooters leave the Amur. The Russian government, knowing that the Amur could not be defended and being more concerned with events in the west, sent Fyodor Golovin east as plenipotentiary. Golovin left Moscow in January 1686 with 500 streltsy and reached Selenginsk near Lake Baikal in October 1687, whence he sent couriers ahead. It was agreed the meeting would be in Selenginsk in 1688. At this point the Oirats (western Mongols) under Galdan attacked the eastern Mongols in the area between Selenginsk and Peking and negotiations had to be delayed. To avoid the fighting Golovin moved east to Nerchinsk where it was agreed that talks would take place. Qing troops with a size of 3,000 to 15,000 soldiers under the command of Songgotu left Peking on June 1689 and arrived in July. Talks went on from August 22 to September 6.

The language used was Latin, the translators being, for the Russians, a Pole named Andrei Bielobocki and for the Chinese the Jesuits Jean-Francois Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira. To avoid problems of precedence, tents were erected side by side so that neither side would be seen as visiting the other. Russian acceptance of the treaty required a relaxation of what had been, in Ming times, an iron rule of Chinese diplomacy, requiring the non-Chinese party to accept language which characterized the foreigner as an inferior or tributary. The conspicuous absence of such language from the Treaty, together with the absence of Chinese language or personnel, suggests that the Kangxi Emperor was using the Manchu language to circumvent his conservative Han bureaucracy. The Yuan dynasty&#x27;s rule of Mongol tribes living around Lake Baikal was claimed by the Qing, who incited the defection of the Nerchinsk Onggut and Buryat Mongols away from the Russians.

The Qing dynasty wished to remove the Russians from the Amur. They were interested in the Amur since it was the northern border of the original Manchu heartland. They could ignore the area west of the Argun since it was then controlled by the Oirats. The Kangxi Emperor also wished to settle with Russia in order to free his hands to deal with the Dzungar Mongols of Central Asia, to his northwest. The Qing dynasty also wanted a delineated frontier to keep nomads and outlaws from fleeing across the border.

The Russians, for their part, knew that the Amur was indefensible and were more interested in establishing profitable trade, which the Kangxi Emperor had threatened to block unless the border dispute were resolved. Golovin accepted the loss of the Amur in exchange for possession of Trans-Baikalia and access to Chinese markets for Russian traders. The Russians were also concerned with the military strength of the Qing dynasty, who had demonstrated their capability, in 1685 and 1686, by twice overrunning the Russian outpost at Albazin.

At this time, Russia could not send large forces to the Far East, as they were launching a war with the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, the Dzungars captured Mongolia, threatening the Qing dynasty, so Russia and Qing dynasty were inclined to sign a peace treaty as soon as possible.

==The border==
The agreed boundary was the Argun River north to its confluence with the Shilka River, up the Shilka to the &quot;Gorbitsa River&quot;, up the Gorbitsa to its headwaters, then along the east-west watershed through the Stanovoy Mountains and down the Uda River (Khabarovsk Krai) to the Sea of Okhotsk at its southwest corner.

The border west of the Argun was not defined (at the time, this area was controlled by the Oirats). Neither side had very exact knowledge of the course of the Uda River. The Gorbitsa is hard to find on modern maps.

==Treaty details==
The treaty had six paragraphs: 1 and 2: definition of the border, 3. Albazin to be abandoned and destroyed. 4. Refugees who arrived before the treaty to stay, those arriving after the treaty to be sent back. 5. Trade to be allowed with proper documents. 6. Boundary stones to be erected, and general exhortations to avoid conflict.

==Economic aspects==
The treaty was &quot;a triumph of intercultural negotiation&quot; that gave Russians access to Chinese markets for expensive furs; Russians purchased porcelain, silk, gold, silver, and tea as well as with provisions for the northern garrisons. The cross-border trade created a multiethnic character to Nerchinsk and Kyakhta in Siberia. They became locales for the interaction of Russian, Central Asian, and Chinese cultures. The trade extended European economic expansion deep into Asia. Profitable trade fell off in the 1720s because the policies of Peter I limited private initiative and ended Siberia&#x27;s role as a major economic link between the West and East.

== Later developments==
Russian interest in the Amur River was revived in the 1750s. In 1757 Fedor Ivanovich Soimonov was sent to map the area. He mapped the Shilka, which was partly in Chinese territory, but was turned back when he reached its confluence with the Argun. In 1757 Vasili Fedorovich Bradishchev was sent to Peking to investigate the possibility of using the Amur. He was received cordially and given a definite no. After that the matter was dropped.

In 1799, when Adam Johann von Krusenstern visited Canton he saw an English ship that had brought furs from Russian America in five months as opposed to the two years or more for the Okhotsk–Yakutsk–Kyakhta route. He saw that this could replace the overland trade. He submitted a memoir to the Naval Ministry which led to his command of the first Russian circumnavigation. He was able to sell American furs at Canton after some official resistance. Only when he returned to Kronstadt did he learn that his presence in Canton had provoked an edict making clear that Russian trade with the Middle Kingdom would be confined to Kyakhta.

<doc id="521915" wikidata="Q539566" url="?curid=521915" title="Tosyl group">
<text>In organic chemistry, a toluenesulfonyl group (tosyl group, abbreviated Ts or Tos) is a univalent functional group with the chemical formula . It consists of a tolyl group, , joined to a sulfonyl group, , with the open valence on sulfur. This group is usually derived from the compound tosyl chloride, (abbreviated TsCl), which forms esters and amides of toluenesulfonic acid, (abbreviated TsOH). The para orientation illustrated (&quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonyl) is most common, and by convention &quot;tosyl&quot; without a prefix refers to the &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonyl group.

The tosyl terminology was proposed by German chemists Kurt Hess and Robert Pfleger in 1933 on the pattern of trityl and adopted in English starting from 1934.

The toluenesulfonate (or tosylate) group refers to the (–OTs) group, with an additional oxygen attached to sulfur and open valence on an oxygen. In a chemical name, the term &quot;tosylate&quot; may either refer to the salts containing the anion of &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonic acid, (e.g., sodium p-toluenesulfonate), or it may refer to esters of &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonic acid, TsOR (R = organyl group).

== Applications ==
For S2 reactions, alkyl alcohols can also be converted to alkyl tosylates, often through addition of tosyl chloride. In this reaction, the lone pair of the alcohol oxygen attacks the sulfur of the tosyl chloride, displacing the chloride and forming the tosylate with retention of reactant stereochemistry. This is useful because alcohols are poor leaving groups in S2 reactions, in contrast to the tosylate group. It is the transformation of alkyl alcohols to alkyl tosylates that allows an S2 reaction to occur in the presence of a good nucleophile.

A tosyl group can function as a protecting group in organic synthesis. Alcohols can be converted to tosylate groups so that they do not react. The tosylate group may later be converted back into an alcohol. The use of these functional groups is exemplified in organic synthesis of the drug tolterodine, wherein one of the steps a phenol group is protected as its tosylate and the primary alcohol as its nosylate. The latter is a leaving group for displacement by diisopropylamine: 
The tosyl group is also useful as a protecting group for amines. The resulting sulfonamide structure is extremely stable. It can be deprotected to reveal the amine using reductive or strongly acidic conditions.

== Amine protection – tosyl (Ts) ==

Tosyl (Ts) group is commonly used as a protecting group for amines in organic synthesis.

=== Most common amine protection methods ===
* Tosyl chloride and pyridine in dichloromethane

=== Most common amine deprotection methods ===
* HBr and acetic acid at 70 °C
* Refluxing with TMSCl, sodium iodide and acetonitrile
* Reduction with SmI2
* Reduction with Red-Al

==Related compounds==

Closely related to the tosylates are the nosylates and brosylates, which are the abbreviated names for &quot;o&quot;- or &quot;p-&quot;nitrobenzenesulfonates and &quot;p&quot;-bromobenzenesulfonates, respectively.

<doc id="521922" wikidata="Q983807" url="?curid=521922" title="Eligiusz Niewiadomski">
<text>Eligiusz Józef Niewiadomski (1 December 1869 – 31 January 1923) was a Polish modernist painter and art critic who sympathized with the right-wing National Democracy movement. In 1922, he assassinated Poland&#x27;s first President, Gabriel Narutowicz, in his first week in office as president.

==Life==
Niewiadomski was born into a family of gentry descent. His father, Wincenty Niewiadomski, of the &quot;Prus&quot; coat-of-arms, was a veteran of the January Uprising and a worker at the Warsaw mint. At the age of two, Eligiusz lost his mother Julia, and was raised by his elder sister Cecylia. After graduating from a local trade school in 1888, Niewiadomski moved to St. Petersburg, where he continued his studies at the Imperial Academy of Arts. He graduated in 1894 with honors, and won a scholarship to the &quot;École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts&quot; in Paris. After his return to Warsaw, he became a student of Wojciech Gerson, one of the best-known Polish artists of the age.

After 1897, he taught drawing at the Warsaw Polytechnic. He also collaborated with a number of Warsaw-based magazines and newspapers as a journalist and art critic, which gave him considerable notoriety, mostly among the artists themselves. He became involved in various artistic movements, among them the &quot;re-discovery&quot; of the Tatra Mountains, which at the time attracted some of the most renowned Polish painters, poets and writers as a source of inspiration. Niewiadomski prepared and published a map of the Tatras, one of the first tourist maps of the area. He also prepared a set of historical maps of Poland, &quot;Album of the History of Poland&quot; (1899). He also became involved in the reorganization of the Zachęta art society. Using contacts acquired there, he promoted the idea of creating a separate Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. However, when the school was finally opened in 1903, Niewiadomski was not invited to teach there.

Politically, Niewiadomski was a strong supporter of nationalism, particularly the National League. In 1901 he was arrested by the Tsarist police for smuggling nationalist propaganda booklets from Galicia into Vistula Land. Though released after several months in the Pawiak Prison, he lost his job at Warsaw Polytechnic and fell into an impoverished state. This further radicalized his political beliefs. During the Russo-Japanese War he promoted the idea of perpetrating anti-Russian sabotage, for which he was excluded from the National League.

To make a living, Niewiadomski began teaching art classes at numerous schools and churches in Poland. He also made frescoes in Konin&#x27;s St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church. However, his two-volume monograph &quot;On Mediaeval Art&quot; sold poorly, and Niewiadomski was on the verge of being forgotten by his contemporaries.

After the outbreak of World War I he remained in Warsaw, where he published brochures and manifestos describing his views on the role of art. He also continued teaching art history and artistic technique at various schools. On 1 March 1918 he was appointed director of painting and sculpture at the Regency Council&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, a post that had previously been turned down by numerous artists.

After Poland regained independence, Niewiadomski joined the newly reborn country&#x27;s Ministry of Culture. In 1920, during the Polish-Soviet War, he tried to join the Polish Army but was turned down as too old. However, he was accepted by Polish intelligence and served as a translator of Russian documents. During the last months of the war, he finally managed to convince his superiors to transfer him to front-line service and fought in the 5th Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiment.

Demobilized in 1921, Niewiadomski returned to the Ministry of Culture and continued his work there as a clerk. However, on 8 November 1921, after Antoni Ponikowski&#x27;s government refused to grant Niewiadomski&#x27;s department a higher budget, he resigned his post. He then devoted himself to writing and prepared several monographs on 19th- and 20th-century Polish painting, and on the theory of art. He made his living illustrating books.

==Assassin==
On 9 December 1922 Gabriel Narutowicz was elected by the National Assembly as the first President of Poland. After a heated debate, Narutowicz&#x27;s candidacy managed to gather 289 votes, including 113 votes of various national minority MPs. The defeated candidate of the National Democratic Party Maurycy Zamoyski gathered 227 votes, yet the National Democrats decided to boycott the President and announced that he was elected by the &quot;Reds, Jews, and Germans&quot; rather than Poles. This started a period of civil unrest in Warsaw, where the supporters of nationalist ideas protested against the election of their president.

On 16 December 1922 the newly elected president attended the opening of an art exhibition at the Zachęta Art Gallery. Niewiadomski, a frequent guest at such gatherings, pulled out his pistol, approached Narutowicz, and shot him. The president died instantly. Arrested on December 30, Niewiadomski demanded a death sentence for himself and was sentenced to death by firing squad. The sentence was carried out at the Warsaw Citadel on 31 January 1923. He was 53 years old. His body was interred at Warsaw&#x27;s Powązki Cemetery. 

A few months after his death, a renowned psychiatrist, Maurycy Urstein, called Niewiadomski&#x27;s execution a judiciary homicide, as the perpetrator was mentally ill and clinically insane but the court had disregarded the need for expert psychiatric testimony.

After his execution, Niewiadomski remained a controversial figure. His funeral was attended by 10,000 people.

== Movie ==
In 1977 director Jerzy Kawalerowicz made the film &quot;Death of a President&quot;. The role of Gabriel Narutowicz was played by Zdzisław Mrożewski, and Eligiusz Niewiadomski - was played by Marek Walczewski.

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;
For most of its history, China was organized into various dynastic states under the rule of hereditary monarchs. Beginning with the establishment of dynastic rule by Yu the Great , and ending with the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor in AD 1912, Chinese historiography came to organize itself around the succession of monarchical dynasties. Besides those established by the dominant Han ethnic group or its spiritual Huaxia predecessors, dynasties throughout Chinese history were also founded by non-Han peoples.

Dividing Chinese history into dynastic epochs is a convenient and conventional method of periodization. Accordingly, a dynasty may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned, as well as to describe events, trends, personalities, artistic compositions, and artifacts of that period. For example, porcelain made during the Ming dynasty may be referred to as &quot;Ming porcelain&quot;.

The longest-reigning orthodox dynasty of China was the Zhou dynasty, ruling for a total length of about 790 years, albeit it is divided into the Western Zhou and the Eastern Zhou in Chinese historiography. The largest orthodox Chinese dynasty in terms of territorial size was either the Yuan dynasty or the Qing dynasty, depending on the historical source.

The term &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Celestial Dynasty&quot; or &quot;Heavenly Dynasty&quot;) was frequently employed as a self-reference by Chinese dynasties. As a form of respect and subordination, Chinese tributary states referred to these dynasties as &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Celestial Dynasty of the Exalted State&quot;) or &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Celestial Dynasty of the Great State&quot;).

==Terminology==
The Chinese character originally meant &quot;morning&quot; or &quot;today&quot;. Subsequently, its scope was extended to refer to the regime of the incumbent ruler. Terms commonly used when discussing historical Chinese dynasties include:

==History==
===Start of dynastic rule===

As the founder of China&#x27;s first orthodox dynasty, the Xia dynasty, Yu the Great is conventionally regarded as the inaugurator of dynastic rule in China. In the Chinese dynastic system, sovereign rulers theoretically possessed absolute power and private ownership of the realm, even though in practice their actual power was dependent on numerous factors. By tradition, the Chinese throne was inherited exclusively by members of the male line, but there were numerous cases whereby the consort kins came to possess &quot;de facto&quot; power at the expense of the monarchs. This concept, known as (; &quot;All under Heaven belongs to the ruling family&quot;), was in contrast to the pre-Xia notion of (; &quot;All under Heaven belongs to the public&quot;) whereby leadership succession was non-hereditary and based on the abdication system.

There may also be a predynastic period before a regime managed to overthrow the existing dynasty which led to the official establishment of the new dynasty. For example, the state of Zhou that existed during the Shang dynasty, before its conquest of the Shang which led to the establishment of the Zhou dynasty, is referred to as the Predynastic Zhou or Proto-Zhou. Similarly, the state of Qin that existed during the Zhou dynasty before its wars of unification and the establishment of the Qin dynasty in 221 BC is also referred to as the Predynastic Qin or Proto-Qin.

===Dynastic transition===

The rise and fall of dynasties is a prominent feature of Chinese history. Some scholars have attempted to explain this phenomenon by attributing the success and failure of dynasties to the morality of the rulers, while others have focused on the tangible aspects of monarchical rule. This method of explanation has come to be known as the dynastic cycle.

Cases of dynastic transition (; ) in the history of China occurred primarily through two ways: military conquest and usurpation. The supersession of the Liao dynasty by the Jin dynasty was achieved following a series of successful military campaigns, as was the later unification of China proper under the Yuan dynasty; on the other hand, the transition from the Eastern Han to the Cao Wei, as well as from the Southern Qi to the Liang dynasty, were cases of usurpation. Oftentimes, usurpers would seek to portray their predecessors as having relinquished the throne willingly—akin to the abdication system of throne succession—as a means to legitimize their rule.

One might incorrectly infer from viewing historical timelines that transitions between dynasties occurred abruptly and roughly. Rather, new dynasties were often established before the complete overthrow of an existing regime. For example, AD 1644 is frequently cited as the year in which the Qing dynasty succeeded the Ming dynasty in possessing the Mandate of Heaven. However, the Qing dynasty was officially proclaimed in AD 1636 by the Emperor Taizong of Qing through renaming the Later Jin established in AD 1616, while the Ming imperial family would rule the Southern Ming until AD 1662. The Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning based in Taiwan continued to oppose the Qing until AD 1683. Meanwhile, other factions also fought for control over China during the Ming–Qing transition, most notably the Shun and the Xi dynasties proclaimed by Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong respectively. This change of ruling houses was a convoluted and prolonged affair, and the Qing took almost two decades to extend their rule over the entirety of China proper.

Similarly, during the earlier Sui–Tang transition, numerous regimes established by rebel forces vied for control and legitimacy as the power of the ruling Sui dynasty weakened. Autonomous regimes that existed during this period of upheaval included, but not limited to, Wei (; by Li Mi), Qin (; by Xue Ju), Qi (; by Gao Tancheng), Xu (; by Yuwen Huaji), Liang (; by Shen Faxing), Liang (; by Liang Shidu), Xia (; by Dou Jiande), Zheng (; by Wang Shichong), Chu (; by Zhu Can), Chu (; by Lin Shihong), Wu (; by Li Zitong), Yan (; by Gao Kaidao), and Song (; by Fu Gongshi). The Tang dynasty that superseded the Sui launched a decade-long military campaign to reunify China proper.

Frequently, remnants and descendants of previous dynasties were either purged or granted noble titles in accordance with the &quot;two crownings, three respects&quot; system. The latter served as a means for the reigning dynasty to claim legitimate succession from earlier dynasties. For example, the Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei was accorded the title &quot;Prince of Zhongshan&quot; by the Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi following the latter&#x27;s deposition of the former. Similarly, Chai Yong, a nephew of the Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou, was conferred the title &quot;Duke of Chongyi&quot; by the Emperor Renzong of Song; other descendants of the Later Zhou ruling house came to inherit the noble title thereafter.

According to Chinese historiographical tradition, each new dynasty would compose the history of the preceding dynasty, culminating in the &quot;Twenty-Four Histories&quot;. This tradition was maintained even after the Xinhai Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty in favor of the Republic of China. However, the attempt by the Republicans to draft the history of the Qing was disrupted by the Chinese Civil War, which resulted in the political division of China into the People&#x27;s Republic of China on mainland China and the Republic of China on Taiwan.

===End of dynastic rule===

Dynastic rule in China collapsed in AD 1912 when the Republic of China superseded the Qing dynasty following the success of the Xinhai Revolution. While there were attempts after the Xinhai Revolution to reinstate dynastic rule in China, they were unsuccessful at consolidating their rule and gaining political legitimacy.

During the Xinhai Revolution, there were numerous proposals advocating for the replacement of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty by a new dynasty of Han ethnicity. Kong Lingyi (), the Duke of Yansheng and a 76th-generation descendant of Confucius, was identified as a potential candidate for Chinese emperorship by Liang Qichao. Meanwhile, gentry in Anhui and Hebei supported a restoration of the Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuxun (), the Marquis of Extended Grace. Both suggestions were ultimately rejected.

The Empire of China (AD 1915–1916) proclaimed by Yuan Shikai sparked the National Protection War, resulting in the premature collapse of the regime 101 days later. The Manchu Restoration (AD 1917) was an unsuccessful attempt at reviving the Qing dynasty, lasting merely 11 days. Similarly, the Manchukuo (AD 1932–1945; monarchy since AD 1934), a puppet state of the Empire of Japan during World War II with limited diplomatic recognition, is not regarded as a legitimate regime. Ergo, historians usually consider the abdication of the Xuantong Emperor on 12 February 1912 as the end of the Chinese dynastic system. Dynastic rule in China lasted almost four millennia.

==Political legitimacy==

China was politically divided during multiple periods in its history, with different regions ruled by different dynasties. These dynasties effectively functioned as separate states with their own court and political institutions. Political division existed during the Three Kingdoms, the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Northern and Southern dynasties, and the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods, among others.

Relations between Chinese dynasties during periods of division often revolved around political legitimacy, which was derived from the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven. Dynasties ruled by ethnic Han would proclaim rival dynasties founded by other ethnicities as illegitimate, usually justified based on the concept of Hua–Yi distinction. On the other hand, many dynasties of non-Han origin saw themselves as the legitimate dynasty of China and often sought to portray themselves as the true inheritor of Chinese culture and history. Traditionally, only regimes deemed as &quot;legitimate&quot; or &quot;orthodox&quot; (; ) are termed (; &quot;dynasty&quot;); &quot;illegitimate&quot; or &quot;unorthodox&quot; regimes are referred to as (; usually translated as either &quot;state&quot; or &quot;kingdom&quot;), even if these regimes were dynastic in nature. 

Such legitimacy disputes existed during the following periods:

* Three Kingdoms
** The Cao Wei, the Shu Han, and the Eastern Wu considered themselves legitimate while simultaneously denounced the rivaling claims of others.
** The Emperor Xian of Han abdicated in favor of the Emperor Wen of Cao Wei; hence, the Cao Wei directly succeeded the Eastern Han in orthodox historiography.
** The Western Jin accepted the Cao Wei as the legitimate dynasty of the Three Kingdoms period and claimed succession from it.
** The Tang dynasty viewed the Cao Wei as the legitimate dynasty during this period, whereas the Southern Song scholar Zhu Xi proposed treating the Shu Han as legitimate.
* Eastern Jin and Sixteen Kingdoms
** The Eastern Jin viewed itself as a continuation of the Western Jin, and thus legitimate.
** Several of the Sixteen Kingdoms such as the Han-Zhao, the Later Zhao, and the Former Qin also claimed legitimacy.
* Northern and Southern dynasties
** All dynasties during this period saw themselves as the legitimate representative of China; the Northern dynasties referred to their southern counterparts as &quot;&quot; (; &quot;island dwelling barbarians&quot;), while the Southern dynasties called their northern neighbors &quot;&quot; (; &quot;barbarians with braids&quot;).
* Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms
** Having directly succeeded the Tang dynasty, the Later Liang considered itself to be a legitimate dynasty.
** The Later Tang regarded itself as the restorer of the earlier Tang dynasty and rejected the legitimacy of its predecessor, the Later Liang.
** The Later Jin succeeded the Later Tang and accepted it as a legitimate regime.
** The Southern Tang was, for a period of time, considered the legitimate dynasty during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period.
** Since the Song dynasty, Chinese historiography has generally considered the Five Dynasties, as opposed to the contemporary Ten Kingdoms, to be legitimate.
* Liao dynasty, Song dynasty, and Jin dynasty
** Following the conquest of the Later Jin, the Liao dynasty claimed legitimacy and succession from it
** Both the Northern Song and Southern Song considered themselves to be the legitimate Chinese dynasty.
** The Jin dynasty challenged the Song&#x27;s claim of legitimacy.
** The succeeding Yuan dynasty recognized all three in addition to the Western Liao as legitimate Chinese dynasties, culminating in the composition of the &quot;History of Liao&quot;, the &quot;History of Song&quot;, and the &quot;History of Jin&quot;.
* Ming dynasty and Northern Yuan
** The Ming dynasty recognized the preceding Yuan dynasty as a legitimate Chinese dynasty, but asserted that it had succeeded the Mandate of Heaven from the Yuan, thus considering the Northern Yuan as illegitimate.
** Northern Yuan rulers maintained the dynastic name &quot;Great Yuan&quot; and claimed traditional Han-style titles continuously until AD 1388 or AD 1402; Han-style titles were restored on several occasions thereafter for brief periods, notably during the reigns of Taisun Khan, Choros Esen, and Dayan Khan.
** The historian Rashipunsug argued that the Northern Yuan had succeeded the legitimacy from the Yuan dynasty; the Qing dynasty, which later defeated and annexed the Northern Yuan, inherited this legitimacy, thus rendering the Ming illegitimate.
* Qing dynasty and Southern Ming
** The Qing dynasty recognized the preceding Ming dynasty as legitimate, but asserted that it had succeeded the Mandate of Heaven from the Ming, thus refuting the claimed legitimacy of the Southern Ming.
** The Southern Ming continued to claim legitimacy until its eventual defeat by the Qing.
** The Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan denounced the Qing dynasty as illegitimate.
** The Joseon dynasty of Korea and the Later Lê dynasty of Vietnam had at various times considered the Southern Ming, instead of the Qing dynasty, as legitimate.
** The Tokugawa shogunate of Japan did not accept the legitimacy of the Qing dynasty and instead saw itself as the rightful representative of (; &quot;China&quot;); this narrative served as the basis of Japanese texts such as &quot;Chūchō Jijitsu&quot; and &quot;Kai Hentai&quot;.

Traditionally, periods of disunity often resulted in heated debates among officials and historians over which prior dynasties could and should be considered orthodox, given that it was politically imperative for a dynasty to present itself as being linked in an unbroken lineage of moral and political authority back to ancient times. However, the Northern Song statesman Ouyang Xiu propounded that such orthodoxy existed in a state of limbo during fragmented periods and was restored after political unification was achieved. From this perspective, the Song dynasty possessed legitimacy by virtue of its ability to end the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period despite not having succeeded the orthodoxy from the Later Zhou. Similarly, Ouyang considered the concept of orthodoxy to be in oblivion during the Three Kingdoms, the Sixteen Kingdoms, and the Northern and Southern dynasties periods.

Traditionally, as most Chinese historiographical sources uphold the idea of unilineal dynastic succession, only one dynasty could be considered orthodox at any given time. Most historical sources consider the legitimate line of succession to be as follows:
These historical legitimacy disputes are similar to the modern competing claims of legitimacy by the People&#x27;s Republic of China based in Beijing and the Republic of China based in Taipei. Both regimes formally adhere to the One-China principle and claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the whole of China.

==Agnatic lineages==

There were several groups of Chinese dynasties that were ruled by families with patrilineal relations, yet due to various reasons these regimes are considered to be separate dynasties and given distinct retroactive names for historiographical purpose. Such conditions as differences in their official dynastic title and fundamental changes having occurred to their rule would necessitate nomenclatural distinction in academia, despite these ruling clans having shared common ancestral origins.

Additionally, numerous other dynasties claimed descent from earlier dynasties as a calculated political move to obtain or enhance their legitimacy, even if such claims were unfounded.

The agnatic relations of the following groups of Chinese dynasties are typically recognized by historians:

==Classification==
===Central Plain dynasties===
The Central Plain is a vast area on the lower reaches of the Yellow River which formed the cradle of Chinese civilization. &quot;Central Plain dynasties&quot; (; ) refer to dynasties of China that had their capital cities situated within the Central Plain. This term could refer to dynasties of both Han and non-Han ethnic origins.

===Unified dynasties===
&quot;Unified dynasties&quot; (; ) refer to dynasties of China, regardless of their ethnic origin, that achieved the unification of China proper. &quot;China proper&quot; is a region generally regarded as the traditional heartland of the Han people, and is not equivalent to the term &quot;China&quot;. Imperial dynasties that had attained the unification of China proper may be known as the &quot;Chinese Empire&quot; or the &quot;Empire of China&quot; (; ).

The concept of &quot;great unity&quot; or &quot;grand unification&quot; (; ) was first mentioned in the &quot;Gongyang Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; that was supposedly authored by the Qi scholar Gongyang Gao. Other prominent figures like Confucius and Mencius also elaborated on this concept in their respective works.

Historians typically consider the following dynasties to have unified China proper: the Qin dynasty, the Western Han, the Xin dynasty, the Eastern Han, the Western Jin, the Sui dynasty, the Tang dynasty, the Wu Zhou, the Northern Song, the Yuan dynasty, the Ming dynasty, and the Qing dynasty. The status of the Northern Song as a unified dynasty is disputed among historians as the Sixteen Prefectures of Yan and Yun were partially administered by the contemporaneous Liao dynasty while the Western Xia exercised partial control over Hetao; the Northern Song, in this sense, did not truly achieve the unification of China proper.

===Infiltration dynasties and conquest dynasties===
According to the historian and sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, dynasties of China founded by non-Han peoples that ruled parts or all of China proper could be classified into two types, depending on the means by which the ruling ethnic groups had entered China proper.

&quot;Infiltration dynasties&quot; or &quot;dynasties of infiltration&quot; (; ) refer to Chinese dynasties founded by non-Han ethnicities that tended towards accepting Han culture and assimilating into the Han-dominant society. For instance, the Han-Zhao and the Northern Wei, established by the Xiongnu and Xianbei ethnicities respectively, are considered infiltration dynasties of China.

&quot;Conquest dynasties&quot; or &quot;dynasties of conquest&quot; (; ) refer to dynasties of China established by non-Han peoples that tended towards resisting Han culture and preserving the identities of the ruling ethnicities. For example, the Liao dynasty and the Yuan dynasty, ruled by the Khitan and Mongol peoples respectively, are considered conquest dynasties of China.

These terms remain sources of controversy among scholars who believe that Chinese history should be analyzed and understood from a multiethnic and multicultural perspective.

==Naming convention==
===Official nomenclature===
It was customary for Chinese monarchs to adopt an official name for the realm, known as the (; &quot;name of the state&quot;), upon the establishment of a dynasty. During the rule of a dynasty, its functioned as the formal name of the state, both internally and for diplomatic purposes.

The formal name of Chinese dynasties was usually derived from one of the following sources:

* The name of the ruling tribe or tribal confederation
** e.g., the Western Xia dynasty took its name from its ruling class, the Xia tribal confederation
* The noble title held by the dynastic founder prior to the founding of the dynasty
** e.g., the Emperor Wu of Chen adopted the dynastic name &quot;Chen&quot; from his pre-imperial title &quot;Prince of Chen&quot; upon the establishment of the Chen dynasty
* The name of a historical state that occupied the same geographical location as the new dynasty
** e.g., the Former Yan was officially named &quot;Yan&quot; based on the ancient State of Yan located in the same region
* The name of a previous dynasty from which the new dynasty claimed descent or succession from, even if such familial link was questionable
** e.g., the Emperor Taizu of Later Zhou officially proclaimed the Later Zhou with the official title &quot;Zhou&quot; as he claimed ancestry from Guo Shu, a royal of the Zhou dynasty
* A term with auspicious or other significant connotations
** e.g., the Yuan dynasty was officially the &quot;Great Yuan&quot;, a name derived from a clause in the &quot;Classic of Changes&quot;, &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Great is the Heavenly and Primal&quot;)

There were instances whereby the official name was changed during the reign of a dynasty. For example, the dynasty known retroactively as Southern Han initially used the name &quot;Yue&quot;, only to be renamed to &quot;Han&quot; subsequently.

The official title of several dynasties bore the character &quot;&quot; (; &quot;great&quot;). In &quot;Yongzhuang Xiaopin&quot; by the Ming historian Zhu Guozhen, it was claimed that the first dynasty to do so was the Yuan dynasty. However, several sources like the &quot;History of Liao&quot; and the &quot;History of Jin&quot; compiled by the Yuan historian Toqto&#x27;a revealed that the official dynastic name of some earlier dynasties such as the Liao and the Jin also contained the character &quot;&quot;. It was also common for officials, subjects, or tributary states of a particular dynasty to include the term &quot;&quot; (or an equivalent term in other languages) when referring to this dynasty as a form of respect, even if the official dynastic name did not include it. For instance, &quot;The Chronicles of Japan&quot; referred to the Tang dynasty as &quot;&quot; (; &quot;Great Tang&quot;) despite its dynastic name being simply &quot;Tang&quot;.

While all dynasties of China sought to associate their respective realm with (; &quot;Central State&quot;; usually translated as &quot;Middle Kingdom&quot; or &quot;China&quot; in English texts) and various other names of China, none of these regimes officially used such names as their dynastic title. Although the Qing dynasty explicitly identified their state with and employed &quot;—and its Manchu equivalent &quot;Dulimbai Gurun&quot;&quot; ()—in official capacity in numerous international treaties beginning with the Treaty of Nerchinsk dated AD 1689, its dynastic name had remained the &quot;Great Qing&quot;. &quot;&quot;, which has become nearly synonymous with &quot;China&quot; in modern times, is a concept with geographical, political, and cultural connotations.

The adoption of , as well as the importance assigned to it, had promulgated within the Sinosphere. Notably, rulers of Vietnam and Korea also declared for their respective realm.

===Retroactive nomenclature===
In Chinese historiography, historians generally do not refer to dynasties directly by their official name. Instead, historiographical names, which were most commonly derived from their official name, are used. For instance, the Sui dynasty is known as such because its formal name was &quot;Sui&quot;. Likewise, the Jin dynasty was officially the &quot;Great Jin&quot;.

When more than one dynasty shared the same Chinese character(s) as their formal name, as was common in Chinese history, prefixes are retroactively applied to dynastic names by historians in order to distinguish between these similarly-named regimes. Frequently used prefixes include:

* Cardinal direction
** &quot;Northern&quot; (; ): e.g., Northern Qi, Northern Yuan
** &quot;Southern&quot; (; ): e.g., Southern Yan, Southern Tang
** &quot;Eastern&quot; (; ): e.g., Eastern Jin, Eastern Wei
** &quot;Western&quot; (; ): e.g., Western Liang, Western Liao
* Sequence
** &quot;Former&quot; (; ): e.g., Former Qin, Former Shu
** &quot;Later&quot; (; ): e.g., Later Zhao, Later Han
* Surname of the ruling family
** e.g., Wu Zhou, Ma Chu
* Other types of prefixes
** e.g., Shu Han (the prefix &quot;Shu&quot; is a reference to the realm&#x27;s geographical location at Sichuan), Hu Xia (the prefix &quot;Hu&quot;, meaning &quot;barbarian&quot;, refers to the dynasty&#x27;s ethnic Xiongnu origin)

A dynasty could be referred to by more than one retroactive name in Chinese historiography, albeit some are more widely used than others. For instance, the Western Han is also known as the &quot;Former Han&quot;, and the Yang Wu is also called the &quot;Southern Wu&quot;.

Scholars usually make a historiographical distinction for dynasties whose rule were interrupted. For example, the Song dynasty is divided into the Northern Song and the Southern Song, with the Jingkang Incident as the dividing line; the original &quot;Song&quot; founded by the Emperor Taizu of Song was therefore differentiated from the &quot;Song&quot; restored under the Emperor Gaozong of Song. In such cases, the regime had collapsed, only to be re-established; a nomenclatural distinction between the original regime and the new regime is thus necessary for historiographical purpose. Major exceptions to this historiographical practice include the Western Qin, the Southern Liang, and the Tang dynasty; the first two were interrupted by the Later Qin, while the continuity of the latter was broken by the Wu Zhou.

In Chinese sources, the term &quot;dynasty&quot; (; ) is usually omitted when referencing dynasties that have prefixes in their historiographical names. Such a practice is sometimes adopted in English usage, even though the inclusion of the word &quot;dynasty&quot; is also widely seen in English scholarly writings. For example, the Northern Zhou is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Northern Zhou dynasty&quot;.

Often, scholars would refer to a specific Chinese dynasty by attaching the word &quot;China&quot; after the dynastic name. For instance, &quot;Tang China&quot; refers to the Chinese state under the rule of the Tang dynasty and the corresponding historical era.

==Territorial extent==

While the earliest orthodox Chinese dynasties were established along the Yellow River and the Yangtze in China proper, numerous Chinese dynasties later expanded beyond the region to encompass other territorial domains.

At various points in time, Chinese dynasties exercised control over China proper (including Hainan, Macau, and Hong Kong), Taiwan, Manchuria (both Inner Manchuria and Outer Manchuria), Sakhalin, Mongolia (both Inner Mongolia and Outer Mongolia), Vietnam, Tibet, Xinjiang, as well as parts of Central Asia, the Korean Peninsula, Afghanistan, and Siberia.

Territorially, the largest orthodox Chinese dynasty was either the Yuan dynasty or the Qing dynasty, depending on the historical source. This discrepancy can be mainly attributed to the ambiguous northern border of the Yuan realm: whereas some sources describe the Yuan border as located to the immediate north of the northern shore of Lake Baikal, others posit that the Yuan dynasty reached as far north as the Arctic coast, with its western boundary with the Golden Horde in Siberia delimited by the Ob and the Irtysh. In contrast, the borders of the Qing dynasty were demarcated and reinforced through a series of international treaties, and thus were more well-defined.

Apart from exerting direct control over the Chinese realm, various dynasties of China also maintained hegemony over other states and tribes through the Chinese tributary system. The Chinese tributary system first emerged during the Western Han and lasted until the 19th century AD when the Sinocentric order broke down.

The modern territorial claims of both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of China are inherited from the lands once held by the Qing dynasty at the time of its collapse.

<text>In mathematics (specifically in measure theory), a Radon measure, named after Johann Radon, is a measure on the -algebra of Borel sets of a Hausdorff topological space that is finite on all compact sets, outer regular on all Borel sets, and inner regular on open sets. These conditions guarantee that the measure is &quot;compatible&quot; with the topology of the space, and most measures used in mathematical analysis and in number theory are indeed Radon measures.

==Motivation==

A common problem is to find a good notion of a measure on a topological space that is compatible with the topology in some sense. One way to do this is to define a measure on the Borel sets of the topological space. In general there are several problems with this: for example, such a measure may not have a well defined support. Another approach to measure theory is to restrict to locally compact Hausdorff spaces, and only consider the measures that correspond to positive linear functionals on the space of continuous functions with compact support (some authors use this as the definition of a Radon measure). This produces a good theory with no pathological problems, but does not apply to spaces that are not locally compact. If there is no restriction to non-negative measures and complex measures are allowed, then Radon measures can be defined as the continuous dual space on the space of continuous functions with compact support. If such a Radon measure is real then it can be decomposed into the difference of two positive measures. Furthermore, an arbitrary Radon measure can be decomposed into four positive Radon measures, where the real and imaginary parts of the functional are each the differences of two positive Radon measures.

The theory of Radon measures has most of the good properties of the usual theory for locally compact spaces, but applies to all Hausdorff topological spaces. The idea of the definition of a Radon measure is to find some properties that characterize the measures on locally compact spaces corresponding to positive functionals, and use these properties as the definition of a Radon measure on an arbitrary Hausdorff space.

==Definitions==

Let be a measure on the -algebra of Borel sets of a Hausdorff topological space .
* The measure is called inner regular or tight if, for every open set , equals the supremum of over all compact subsets of .
* The measure is called outer regular if, for every Borel set , equals the infimum of over all open sets containing .
* The measure is called locally finite if every point of has a neighborhood for which is finite.

If is locally finite, then it follows that is finite on compact sets, and for locally compact Hausdorff spaces, the converse holds, too. Thus, in this case, local finiteness may be equivalently replaced by finiteness on compact subsets.

The measure is called a Radon measure if it is inner regular and locally finite. In many situations, such as finite measures on locally compact spaces, this also implies outer regularity (see also Radon spaces).

(It is possible to extend the theory of Radon measures to non-Hausdorff spaces, essentially by replacing the word &quot;compact&quot; by &quot;closed compact&quot; everywhere. However, there seem to be almost no applications of this extension.)

==Radon measures on locally compact spaces==

When the underlying measure space is a locally compact topological space, the definition of a Radon measure can be expressed in terms of continuous linear functionals on the space of continuous functions with compact support. This makes it possible to develop measure and integration in terms of functional analysis, an approach taken by Bourbaki and a number of other authors.

===Measures===

In what follows denotes a locally compact topological space. The continuous real-valued functions with compact support on form a vector space , which can be given a natural locally convex topology. Indeed, is the union of the spaces of continuous functions with support contained in compact sets . Each of the spaces carries naturally the topology of uniform convergence, which makes it into a Banach space. But as a union of topological spaces is a special case of a direct limit of topological spaces, the space can be equipped with the direct limit locally convex topology induced by the spaces ; this topology is finer than the topology of uniform convergence.

formula_3

Conversely, by the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem, each linear form on arises as integration with respect to a unique regular Borel measure.

A real-valued Radon measure is defined to be continuous linear form on ; they are precisely the differences of two Radon measures. This gives an identification of real-valued Radon measures with the dual space of the locally convex space . These real-valued Radon measures need not be signed measures. For example, is a real-valued Radon measure, but is not even an extended signed measure as it cannot be written as the difference of two measures at least one of which is finite.

Some authors use the preceding approach to define positive Radon measures to be the positive linear forms on . In this set-up it is common to use a terminology in which Radon measures in the above sense are called &quot;positive&quot; measures and real-valued Radon measures as above are called (real) measures.

===Integration===

To complete the buildup of measure theory for locally compact spaces from the functional-analytic viewpoint, it is necessary to extend measure (integral) from compactly supported continuous functions. This can be done for real or complex-valued functions in several steps as follows:
# Definition of the upper integral of a lower semicontinuous positive (real-valued) function as the supremum (possibly infinite) of the positive numbers for compactly supported continuous functions ;
# Definition of the upper integral for an arbitrary positive (real-valued) function as the infimum of upper integrals for lower semi-continuous functions ;
# Definition of the vector space as the space of all functions on for which the upper integral of the absolute value is finite; the upper integral of the absolute value defines a semi-norm on , and is a complete space with respect to the topology defined by the semi-norm;
# Definition of the space of integrable functions as the closure inside of the space of continuous compactly supported functions.
# Definition of the integral for functions in as extension by continuity (after verifying that is continuous with respect to the topology of );
# Definition of the measure of a set as the integral (when it exists) of the indicator function of the set.

It is possible to verify that these steps produce a theory identical with the one that starts from a Radon measure defined as a function that assigns a number to each Borel set of .

The Lebesgue measure on can be introduced by a few ways in this functional-analytic set-up. First, it is possibly to rely on an &quot;elementary&quot; integral such as the Daniell integral or the Riemann integral for integrals of continuous functions with compact support, as these are integrable for all the elementary definitions of integrals. The measure (in the sense defined above) defined by elementary integration is precisely the Lebesgue measure. Second, if one wants to avoid reliance on Riemann or Daniell integral or other similar theories, it is possible to develop first the general theory of Haar measures and define the Lebesgue measure as the Haar measure on that satisfies the normalisation condition .

==Examples==

The following are all examples of Radon measures:
* Lebesgue measure on Euclidean space (restricted to the Borel subsets);
* Haar measure on any locally compact topological group;
* Dirac measure on any topological space;
* Gaussian measure on Euclidean space with its Borel sigma algebra;
* Probability measures on the -algebra of Borel sets of any Polish space. This example not only generalizes the previous example, but includes many measures on non-locally compact spaces, such as Wiener measure on the space of real-valued continuous functions on the interval .
* A measure on is a Radon measure if and only if it is a locally finite Borel measure.

The following are not examples of Radon measures:
* Counting measure on Euclidean space is an example of a measure that is not a Radon measure, since it is not locally finite.
* The space of ordinals at most equal to , the first uncountable ordinal with the order topology is a compact topological space. The measure which equals on any Borel set that contains an uncountable closed subset of , and otherwise, is Borel but not Radon, as the one-point set has measure zero but any open neighbourhood of it has measure .
* Let be the interval equipped with the topology generated by the collection of half open intervals . This topology is sometimes called Sorgenfrey line. On this topological space, standard Lebesgue measure is not Radon since it is not inner regular, since compact sets are at most countable.
* Let be a Bernstein set in (or any Polish space). Then no measure which vanishes at points on is a Radon measure, since any compact set in is countable.
* Standard product measure on for uncountable is not a Radon measure, since any compact set is contained within a product of uncountably many closed intervals, each of which is shorter than 1.

We note that, intuitively, the Radon measure is useful in mathematical finance particularly for working with Lévy processes because it has the properties of both Lebesgue and Dirac measures, as unlike the Lebesgue, a Radon measure on a single point is not necessarily of measure .

==Basic properties==

===Moderated Radon measures===
Given a Radon measure on a space , we can define another measure (on the Borel sets) by putting

formula_4

The measure is outer regular, and locally finite, and inner regular for open sets. It coincides with on compact and open sets, and can be reconstructed from as the unique inner regular measure that is the same as on compact sets. The measure is called moderated if is -finite; in this case the measures and are the same. (If is -finite this does not imply that is -finite, so being moderated is stronger than being -finite.)

On a hereditarily Lindelöf space every Radon measure is moderated.

An example of a measure that is -finite but not moderated as follows. The topological space has as underlying set the subset of the real plane given by the -axis of points together with the points with , positive integers. The topology is given as follows. The single points are all open sets. A base of neighborhoods of the point is given by wedges consisting of all points in of the form with for a positive integer . This space is locally compact. The measure is given by letting the -axis have measure and letting the point have measure . This measure is inner regular and locally finite, but is not outer regular as any open set containing the -axis has measure infinity. In particular the -axis has -measure but -measure infinity.

===Radon spaces===

A topological space is called a Radon space if every finite Borel measure is a Radon measure, and strongly Radon if every locally finite Borel measure is a Radon measure. Any Suslin space is strongly Radon, and moreover every Radon measure is moderated.

===Duality===

On a locally compact Hausdorff space, Radon measures correspond to positive linear functionals on the space of continuous functions with compact support. This is not surprising as this property is the main motivation for the definition of Radon measure.

===Metric space structure===

The pointed cone of all (positive) Radon measures on can be given the structure of a complete metric space by defining the Radon distance between two measures to be
formula_5

This metric has some limitations. For example, the space of Radon probability measures on ,
formula_6
is not sequentially compact with respect to the Radon metric: i.e., it is not guaranteed that any sequence of probability measures will have a subsequence that is convergent with respect to the Radon metric, which presents difficulties in certain applications. On the other hand, if is a compact metric space, then the Wasserstein metric turns into a compact metric space.

Convergence in the Radon metric implies weak convergence of measures:
formula_7
but the converse implication is false in general. Convergence of measures in the Radon metric is sometimes known as strong convergence, as contrasted with weak convergence.

<text>Sneakernet, also called sneaker net, is an informal term for the transfer of electronic information by physically moving media such as magnetic tape, floppy disks, optical discs, USB flash drives or external hard drives between computers, rather than transmitting it over a computer network. Sneakernets enable data transfer through physical means and offer a solution in the presence of network connections that lack reliability; however, a consequence of this physical transfer is high latency. The term, a tongue-in-cheek play on &quot;net(work)&quot; as in &quot;Internet&quot; or &quot;Ethernet&quot;, refers to walking in sneakers as the transport mechanism.

==Summary and background==
Sneakernets are in use throughout the computer universe. A sneakernet may be used when computer networks are prohibitively expensive for the owner to maintain; in high-security environments where manual inspection (for re-classification of information) is necessary; where information needs to be shared between networks with different levels of security clearance; when data transfer is impractical due to bandwidth limitations; when a particular system is simply incompatible with the local network, unable to be connected, or when two systems are not on the same network at the same time. Because sneakernets take advantage of physical media, security measures used for the transfer of sensitive information are respectively physical.

This form of data transfer is also used for peer-to-peer (or friend-to-friend) file sharing and has grown in popularity in metropolitan areas and college communities. The ease of this system has been facilitated by the availability of USB external hard drives, USB flash drives and portable music players.

The United States Postal Service offers a Media Mail service for compact discs, among other items. This provides a viable mode of transport for long distance sneakernet use. In fact, when mailing media with sufficiently high data density such as high capacity hard drives, the throughput (data transferred per unit of time) as well as the cost per unit of data transferred may compete favorably with networked methods of data transfer.

A quantum version of sneakernet was proposed in a paper by Simon Devitt and collaborators in 2016.

==Usage examples==
===Afghanistan===
In 2021 Taliban-governed Afghanistan, &quot;computer &quot;kars&quot;&quot; distribute Internet-derived content by hand: &quot;Movies, music, mobile applications, iOS updates, and naughty videos. Also creating Apple IDs and social media accounts, and backing up and unlocking phones and recovering data.&quot; The &quot;kars&quot; collectively maintain an archive of hundreds of terabytes of data. Four terabytes of the latest Indian or American movies or Turkish TV dramas, dubbed in the Afghan national languages Dari and Pashto reportedly wholesale for about 800 afghanis, or nine US dollars, while the retail price of five gigabytes of content is 100 afghanis, or one US dollar. &quot;Kars&quot; report that their earnings have dropped 90% under Taliban rule.

===Australia===
When Australia joined Usenet in 1983, it received articles via tapes sent from the United States to the University of Sydney, which disseminated data to dozens of other computers on the country&#x27;s Unix network.

===Bhutan===
The Rigsum Sherig Collection project uses a sneakernet to distribute offline educational resources, including Kiwix and Khan Academy on a Stick, to hundreds of schools and other educational institutions in the Kingdom of Bhutan. Many of the schools in Bhutan have computers or IT labs, but no Internet connection (or a very slow one). The sneakernet, facilitated by teachers, distributes about 25 GB of free, open-source educational software to the schools, often using external hard disks.

===Cuba===
El Paquete Semanal is a roughly 1TB compilation of media, distributed weekly throughout Cuba via portable hard drives and USB memory sticks.

===Iran===
A weekly data dump compilation collected through the satellite system Toosheh.

===North Korea===
North Korean dissidents have been known to smuggle flash drives filled with western movies and television shows.

===Pakistan===
The May 2011 raid of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, revealed that he used a series of USB thumb drives to store his email drafts. A courier of his would then take the saved emails to a nearby Internet cafe and send them out to the desired recipients.

===South Africa===
In September 2009, Durban company Unlimited IT reportedly pitted a messenger pigeon against South African ISP Telkom to transfer 4 GB of data from Howick to Durban. The pigeon, carrying the data on a memory stick, arrived in one hour eight minutes, with the data taking another hour to read from the memory stick. During the same two-hour period, only about 4.2% of the data had been transferred over the ADSL link. A similar experiment was conducted in England in September 2010; the &quot;pigeonnet&quot; also proved superior. In November 2009 the Australian comedy/current-affairs television program &quot;Hungry Beast&quot; repeated this experiment. The experiment had the team transfer a 700 MB file via three delivery methods to determine which was the fastest; A carrier pigeon with a microSD card, a car carrying a USB Stick, or a Telstra ADSL line. The data was to be transferred a distance of by road. The pigeon won the race with a time of approximately 1 hour 5 minutes, the car came in second at 2 hours 10 minutes, while the internet transfer did not finish, having dropped out a second time and not come back.

Wizzy Digital Courier provided Internet access to schools in South Africa with poor or no network connectivity by implementing UUCP on USB memory sticks. This allowed offline cached email transport and scoops of web pages to back-fill a web cache.

===United States===
Google has used a sneakernet to transport large datasets, including 120 TB of data from the Hubble Space Telescope. Users of Google Cloud can import their data into Google Cloud Storage through sneakernet. Oracle similarly offers its Data Transfer Service to customers to migrate data to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or export data from it.

The SETI@home project uses a sneakernet to overcome bandwidth limitations: data recorded by the radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico was stored on magnetic tapes which were then shipped to Berkeley, California, for processing. In 2005, Jim Gray reported sending hard drives and even &quot;metal boxes with processors&quot; to transport large amounts of data by postal mail.

Very Long Baseline Interferometry performed using the Very Long Baseline Array ships hard drives to a data reduction site in Socorro, New Mexico. They refer to their data transfer mechanism as &quot;HDOA&quot; (Hard Drives On Airplane).

Data analytics teams in the financial services sector often use sneakernets to transfer sensitive corporate information and information obtained from data mining, such as ledger entries, customer data and financial statistics. There are several reasons for this: firstly, sneakernets can generally provide very high security (and possibly more importantly, they are &quot;perceived&quot; to be secure) due to the impossibility of a man-in-the-middle attack or packet sniffing; secondly, the volumes of data concerned are often extremely high; and thirdly, setting up secure network links between the client business and the analytics team&#x27;s facilities is often either impossible or an extremely convoluted process.

In 2015 Amazon Web Services launched AWS Snowball, a , 50 TB device for transporting data to the AWS cloud; and in 2016 AWS Snowmobile, a truck to transport up to 100 PB of data in one load. For similar reasons, there is also a Google Transfer Appliance, an IBM Cloud Mass Data Migration device, and Microsoft&#x27;s Azure Data Box Disk service.

Observation data from the Event Horizon Telescope is collected on hard drives which are transported by commercial freight airplanes from the various telescopes to the MIT Haystack Observatory and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, where the data is analyzed.

===USSR===
In later USSR, the operating system called DEMOS was created and adapted for many types of Soviet computers by cloning versions of UNIX that were brought into USSR on magnetic tapes bypassing the Iron Curtain. This allowed to build Relcom country-wide UUCP network to provide global Usenet access for Soviet users which led to the registration of .su (&quot;Soviet Union&quot;) top level domain in 1990.

==In media==

===Non-fiction===
The first USENET citation is July 16, 1985, and it was widely considered an old joke already.

Other alleged speakers included Tom Reidel, Warren Jackson, or Bob Sutterfield.

Although the station wagon transporting magnetic tapes is generally considered the canonical version, variants using trucks or Boeing 747s or C-5s and later storage technologies such as CD-ROMs, DVDs, Blu-rays, or SD Cards have frequently appeared.

The very first problem in Andrew S. Tanenbaum&#x27;s 1981 textbook &quot;Computer Networks&quot; asks the student to calculate the bandwidth of a St. Bernard carrying floppy disks.

===Fiction===
* In &quot;Minority Report&quot;, the computer center of the &quot;Precrime&quot; police division operates by transferring data from one console to another using a thin, flat storage device.
* The Terry Pratchett novel &quot;Going Postal&quot; (2004) includes a contest between a horse-drawn mail coach and the &quot;Grand Trunk Clacks&quot; (a semaphore line) to see which is faster to transmit the contents of a book to a remote destination.
* William Gibson&#x27;s novel &quot;Spook Country&quot; (2007) also features sneakernets, with iPods being the storage device used to clandestinely move information.
* In Cory Doctorow&#x27;s novel &quot;Little Brother&quot;, the main character uses the term &quot;sneakernet&quot; to describe how he and his friends distribute the fictitious XNet software for encrypted communications.

<doc id="521941" wikidata="Q734611" url="?curid=521941" title="Anti-social behaviour">
<text>Anti-social behaviours, sometimes called dissocial behaviours, are actions which are considered to violate the rights of or otherwise harm others by committing crime or nuisance, such as stealing and physical attack or noncriminal behaviours such as lying and manipulation. It is considered to be disruptive to others in society. This can be carried out in various ways, which includes, but is not limited to, intentional aggression, as well as covert and overt hostility. Anti-social behaviour also develops through social interaction within the family and community. It continuously affects a child&#x27;s temperament, cognitive ability and their involvement with negative peers, dramatically affecting children&#x27;s cooperative problem-solving skills. Many people also label behaviour which is deemed contrary to prevailing norms for social conduct as anti-social behaviour. However, researchers have stated that it is a difficult term to define, particularly in the United Kingdom where many acts fall into its category. The term is especially used in Irish English and British English.

Although the term is fairly new to the common lexicon, the word &quot;anti-social behaviour&quot; has been used for many years in the psychosocial world where it was defined as &quot;unwanted behaviour as the result of personality disorder.&quot; For example, David Farrington, a British criminologist and forensic psychologist, stated that teenagers can exhibit anti-social behaviour by engaging in various amounts of wrongdoings such as stealing, vandalism, sexual promiscuity, excessive smoking, heavy drinking, confrontations with parents, and gambling. In children, conduct disorders could result from ineffective parenting. Anti-social behaviour is typically associated with other behavioural and developmental issues such as hyperactivity, depression, learning disabilities, and impulsivity. Alongside these issues one can be predisposed or more inclined to develop such behaviour due to one&#x27;s genetics, neurobiological and environmental stressors in the prenatal stage of one&#x27;s life, through the early childhood years.

The American Psychiatric Association, in its &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, diagnoses persistent anti-social behaviour starting from a young age as antisocial personality disorder. Genetic factors include abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex of the brain while neurobiological risk include maternal drug use during pregnancy, birth complications, low birth weight, prenatal brain damage, traumatic head injury, and chronic illness. The World Health Organization includes it in the International Classification of Diseases as dissocial personality disorder. A pattern of persistent anti-social behaviours can also be present in children and adolescents diagnosed with conduct problems, including conduct disorder or oppositional defiant disorder under the DSM-5. It has been suggested that individuals with intellectual disabilities have higher tendencies to display anti-social behaviours, but this may be related to social deprivation and mental health problems. More research is required on this topic.

==Development==
Intent and discrimination may determine both pro-social and anti-social behaviour. Infants may act in seemingly anti-social ways and yet be generally accepted as too young to know the difference before the age of four or five. Berger states that parents should teach their children that &quot;emotions need to be regulated, not depressed&quot;. One problem with the assumption that a behaviour that is &quot;simply ignorant&quot; in infants would have antisocial causes in persons older than four or five years at the same time as the latter are supposed to have more complex brains (and with it a more advanced consciousness) is that it presumes that what appears to be the same behaviour would have fewer possible causes in a more complex brain than in a less complex brain, which is criticized because a more complex brain increases the number of possible causes of what looks like the same behaviour as opposed to decreasing it.

Studies have shown that in children between ages 13–14 who bully or show aggressive behaviour towards others exhibit anti-social behaviours in their early adulthood. There are strong statistical relationships that show this significant association between childhood aggressiveness and anti-social behaviours. Analyses saw that 20% of these children who exhibit anti-social behaviours at later ages had court appearances and police contact as a result of their behaviour.

Many of the studies regarding the media&#x27;s influence on anti-social behaviour have been deemed inconclusive. Some reviews have found strong correlations between aggression and the viewing of violent media, while others find little evidence to support their case. The only unanimously accepted truth regarding anti-social behaviour is that parental guidance carries an undoubtedly strong influence; providing children with brief negative evaluations of violent characters helps to reduce violent effects in the individual.

== Cause and effects ==
===Family===

Families greatly impact the causation of anti-social behaviour. Some other familial causes are parent history of anti-social behaviours, parental alcohol and drug abuse, unstable home life, absence of good parenting, physical abuse, parental instability (mental health issues/PTSD) and economic distress within the family.

===Neurobiology===
Studies have found that there is a link between antisocial behaviour and increased amygdala activity specifically centered around facial expressions that are based in anger. This research focuses on the fact that the symptom of over reactivity to perceived threats that comes with antisocial behaviour may be from this increase in amygdala activity. This focus on perceived threat does not include emotions centered around distress.

===Consumption patterns===
There is a small link between antisocial personality characteristics in adulthood and more TV watching as a child. The risk of early adulthood criminal conviction increased by nearly 30 percent with each hour children spent watching TV on an average weekend. Peers can also impact one&#x27;s predisposition to anti-social behaviours, in particular, children in peer groups are more likely to associate with anti-social behaviours if present within their peer group. Especially within youth, patterns of lying, cheating and disruptive behaviours found in young children are early signs of anti-social behaviour. Adults must intervene if they notice their children providing these behaviours. Early detection is best in the preschool years and middle school years in best hopes of interrupting the trajectory of these negative patterns. These patterns in children can lead to conduct disorder, a disorder that allows children to rebel against atypical age-appropriate norms. Moreover, these offences can lead to oppositional defiant disorder, which allows children to be defiant against adults and create vindictive behaviours and patterns. Furthermore, children who exhibit anti-social behaviour also are more prone to alcoholism in adulthood.

== Intervention and treatment ==
As a high prevalence mental health problem in children, many interventions and treatments are developed to prevent anti-social behaviours and to help reinforce pro-social behaviours.

Several factors are considered as direct or indirect causes of developing anti-social behaviour in children. Addressing these factors is necessary to develop a reliable and effective intervention or treatment. Children&#x27;s perinatal risk, temperament, intelligence, nutrition level, and interaction with parents or caregivers can influence their behaviours. As for parents or caregivers, their personality traits, behaviours, socioeconomic status, social network, and living environment can also affect children&#x27;s development of anti-social behaviour.

An individual&#x27;s age at intervention is a strong predictor of the effectiveness of a given treatment. The specific kinds of anti-social behaviours exhibited, as well as the magnitude of those behaviours also impact how effective a treatment is for an individual. Behavioural parent training (BPT) is more effective to preschool or elementary school-aged children, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has higher effectiveness for adolescents. Moreover, early intervention of anti-social behaviour is relatively more promising. For preschool children, family is the main consideration for the context of intervention and treatment. The interaction between children and parents or caregivers, parenting skills, social support, and socioeconomic status would be the factors. For school-aged children, the school context also needs to be considered. The collaboration amongst parents, teachers, and school psychologists is usually recommended to help children develop the ability of resolving conflicts, managing their anger, developing positive interactions with other students, and learning pro-social behaviours within both home and school settings.

Moreover, the training for parents or caregivers are also important. Their children would be more likely to learn positive social behaviours and reduce inappropriate behaviours if they become good role models and have effective parenting skills.

=== Cognitive behavioural therapy ===
Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), is a highly effective, evidence-based therapy, in relation to anti-social behaviour. This type of treatment focuses on enabling the patients to create an accurate image of the self, allowing the individuals to find the trigger of their harmful actions and changing how individuals think and act in social situations. Due to their impulsivity, their inability to form trusting relationships and their nature of blaming others when a situation arises, individuals with particularly aggressive anti-social behaviours tend to have maladaptive social cognitions, including hostile attribution bias, which lead to negative behavioural outcomes. CBT has been found to be more effective for older children and less effective for younger children. Problem-solving skills training (PSST) is a type of CBT that aims to recognize and correct how an individual thinks and consequently behaves in social environments. This training provides steps to assist people in obtaining the skill to be able to evaluate potential solutions to problems occurring outside of therapy and learn how to create positive solutions to avoid physical aggression and resolve conflict.

Therapists, when providing CBT intervention to individuals with anti-social behaviour, should first assess the level of the risk of the behaviour in order to establish a plan on the duration and intensity of the intervention. Moreover, therapists should support and motivate individuals to practice the new skills and behaviours in environments and contexts where the conflicts would naturally occur to observe the effects of CBT.

=== Behavioural parent training ===
Behavioural parent training (BPT) or parent management training (PMT), focuses on changing how parents interact with their children and equips them with ways to recognize and change their child&#x27;s maladaptive behaviour in a variety of situations. BPT assumes that individuals are exposed to reinforcements and punishments daily and that anti-social behaviour, which can be learned, is a result of these reinforcements and punishments. Since certain types of interactions between parents and children may reinforce a child&#x27;s anti-social behaviour, the aim of BPT is to teach the parent effective skills to better manage and communicate with their child. This could be done by reinforcing pro-social behaviours while punishing or ignoring anti-social behaviours. It is important to note that the effects of this therapy can be seen only if the newly acquired communication methods are maintained. BPT has been found to be most effective for younger children under the age of 12. Researchers credit the effectiveness of this treatment at younger ages due to the fact that younger children are more reliant on their parents. BPT is used to treat children with conduct problems, but also for children with ADHD.

According to a meta-analysis, the effectiveness of BPT is supported by short-term changes on the children&#x27;s anti-social behaviour. However, whether these changes are maintained over a longer period of time is still unclear.

=== School-based Intervention ===

First Step to Success is an early intervention for Kindergarten to 3rd grade children who are demonstrating antisocial behaviours. First Step is a collaborative intervention between home and school. There are three important components: (1) Screening; (2) School intervention (CLASS): teaches the child appropriate behaviour through positive reinforcement; (3) Home intervention (HomeBase): teaches the parent key skills for supporting their child and the use of positive reinforcement. The classroom intervention phase (CLASS) takes about 30 days to complete and has 3 phases: (1) Coach-led; (2) Teacher-led; (3) Maintaining. The Red Card/Green Card game (red = inappropriate behaviour; green = appropriate behaviour) is played at school each day. The coach/teacher shows a red/green card as a visual cue to the target student based on their current behaviour. Points are earned if the card is on green at the end of a timed interval. If enough points are earned at the end of the game, the target child gets to choose a reward that the entire class can enjoy together (i.e., extra time at recess, playing a special game, etc.). Coaches/teachers communicate daily with parent(s) throughout the intervention. The home intervention (HomeBase) begins a few days after the classroom intervention. HomeBase builds parent&#x27;s confidence in 6 specific skill areas and in parent-child activities. Coaches meet with parent(s) once weekly for 6 weeks. Parent(s) engage with the target child for 10–15 minutes daily in one-on-one time during the intervention. Overall, First Steps takes about 3 months to implement, requires minimal time from parent(s) and teachers and has shown empirically positive results in increasing prosocial behaviour in at-risk children.

=== Psychotherapy ===
Psychotherapy or talk therapy, although not always effective, can also be used to treat individuals with anti-social behaviour. Individuals can learn skills such as anger and violence management. This type of therapy can help individuals with anti-social behaviour bridge the gap between their feelings and behaviours, which they lack the connection previously. It is most effective when specific issues are being discussed with individuals with anti-social behaviours, rather than a broad general concept. This type of therapy works well with individuals who are at a mild to moderate stage of anti-social behaviour since they still have some sense of responsibility regarding their own problems. Mentalization-based treatment is another form of group psychotherapy shifting its focus on the relational and mental factors related to anti-social personality disorder rather than anger management and violent acts. This particular group therapy targets the mentalizing vulnerabilities and attachment patterns of patients by using a semi-structured group process focused on personal formulation and by establishing group values to promote learning from other members and generating &quot;we-ness.&quot;

When working with individuals with anti-social behaviour, therapist must be mindful of building a trusting therapeutic relationship since these individuals might have never experienced rewarding relationships. Therapists also need to be reminded that changes might take place slowly, thus an ability for noticing small changes and constant encouragement for individuals with anti-social behaviour to continue the intervention are required.

==== Family therapy ====
Family therapy, which is a type of psychotherapy, helps promote communication between family members, thus resolving conflicts related to anti-social behaviour. Since family exerts enormous influence over children&#x27;s development, it is important to identify the behaviours that could potentially lead to anti-social behaviours in children. It is a relatively short-term therapy which involves the family members who are willing to participate. Family therapy can be used to address specific topics such as aggression. The therapy may end when the family can resolve conflicts without needing the therapists to intervene.

== Diagnosis ==
There is no official diagnosis for anti-social behaviour. However, we can have a look at the official diagnosis for antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and use it as guideline while keeping in mind that anti-social behaviour and ASPD are not to be confused.

===Distinguishing from antisocial personality disorder===
When looking at non-ASPD patients (who show anti-social behaviour) and ASPD patients, it all comes down to the same types of behaviours. However, ASPD is a personality disorder which is defined by the consistency and stability of the observed behaviour, in this case, anti-social behaviour. Antisocial personality disorder can only be diagnosed when a pattern of anti-social behaviour began being noticeable during childhood and/or early teens and remained stable and consistent across time and context. In the official DSM IV-TR for ASPD, it is specified that the anti-social behaviour has to occur outside of time frames surrounding traumatic life events or &quot;manic episodes&quot; (if the individual is diagnosed with another mental disorder). The diagnosis for ASPD cannot be done before the age of 18. For example, someone who exhibits anti-social behaviour with their family but pro-social behaviour with friends and coworkers would not qualify for ASPD because the behaviour is not consistent across context. Someone who was consistently behaving in a pro-social way and then begins exhibiting anti-social behaviour in response to a specific life event would not qualify for ASPD either because the behaviour is not stable across time.

Law breaking behaviour in which the individuals are putting themselves or others at risk is considered anti-social even if it is not consistent or stable (examples: speeding, use of drugs, getting in physical conflict). In relation to the previous statement, &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot; is a core element to the diagnosis of ASPD. Individuals who begin getting in trouble with the law (in more than one area) at an abnormally early age (around 15) and keep recurrently doing so in adulthood may be suspected of having ASPD.

=== Evidence: frustration and aggression ===
With some limitations, research has established a correlation between frustration and aggression when it comes to anti-social behaviour. The presence of anti-social behaviour may be detected when an individual is experiencing an abnormally high amount of frustrations in their daily life routine and when those frustrations always result into aggression. The term &quot;impulsivity&quot; is commonly used to describe this behavioural pattern. Anti-social behaviour can also be detected if the aggressiveness and impulsiveness of the individual&#x27;s behaviour in response to frustrations is so that it causes obstruction to social interactions and achievement of personal goals. In both of these cases, we can consider the different types of treatment and therapy previously mentioned in this article.
* Examples in childhood: unable to make friends, unable to follow rules, getting kicked out of school, unable to fulfill minimal levels of education (elementary school, middle school).
* Examples in early adulthood: unable to keep a job or an apartment, difficulty with maintaining relationships.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis of having anti-social behaviour is not very favourable due to its high stability throughout children development. Studies have shown that children who are aggressive and have conduct problems are more likely to have anti-social behaviour in adolescence. Early intervention of anti-social behaviour is relatively more effective since the anti-social pattern lasts for a shorter period of time. Moreover, since younger children would have smaller social networks and less social activities, fewer contexts need to be considered for the intervention and treatment. For adolescents, studies have shown that the influence of treatments becomes less effective.

The prognosis seems to not be influenced by the duration of intervention, however; a long-term follow-up is necessary to confirm that the intervention or treatment is effective.

Individuals who exhibit anti-social behaviour are more likely to use drugs and abuse alcohol. This could make the prognosis worse since he or she would less likely be involved in social activities and would become more isolated.

==By location==
===United Kingdom===
An anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) is a civil order made against a person who has been shown, on the balance of evidence, to have engaged in anti-social behaviour. The orders, introduced in the United Kingdom by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 1998, were designed to criminalize minor incidents that would not have warranted prosecution before.

The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 defines anti-social behaviour as acting in a manner that has &quot;caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household&quot; as the perpetrator. There has been debate concerning the vagueness of this definition.

However, among legal professionals in the UK there are behaviours commonly considered to fall under the definitions of anti-social behaviour. These include, but are not limited to, threatening or intimidating actions, racial or religious harassment, verbal abuse, and physical abuse.

In a survey conducted by University College London during May 2006, the UK was thought by respondents to be Europe&#x27;s worst country for anti-social behaviour, with 76% believing Britain had a &quot;big or moderate problem&quot;.

Current legislation governing anti-social behaviour in the UK is the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 which received Royal Assent in March 2014 and came into enforcement in October 2014. This replaces tools such as the ASBO with 6 streamlined tools designed to make it easier to act on anti-social behaviour.

=== Australia ===
Anti-social behaviour can have a negative effect and impact on Australian communities and their perception of safety. The Western Australia Police force define anti-social behaviour as any behaviour that annoys, irritates, disturbs or interferes with a person&#x27;s ability to go about their lawful business. In Australia, many different acts are classed as anti-social behaviour, such as: misuse of public space; disregard for community safety; disregard for personal well-being; acts directed at people; graffiti; protests; liquor offences; and drunk driving. It has been found that it is very common for Australian adolescents to engage in different levels of anti-social behaviour. A survey was conducted in 1996 in New South Wales, Australia, of 441, 234 secondary school students in years 7 to 12 about their involvement in anti-social activities. 38.6% reported intentionally damaging or destroying someone else&#x27;s property, 22.8% admitted to having received or selling stolen goods and close to 40% confessed to attacking someone with the idea of hurting them. The Australian community are encouraged to report any behaviour of concern and play a vital role assisting police in reducing anti-social behaviour. One study conducted in 2016 established how perpetrators of anti-social behaviour may not actually intend to cause offense. The study examined anti-social behaviours (or microaggressions) within the LGBTIQ community on a university campus. The study established how many members felt that other people would often commit anti-social behaviours, however there was no explicit suggestion of any maliciousness behind these acts. Rather, it was just that the offenders were naive to the impact of their behaviour.

The Western Australia Police force uses a three-step strategy to deal with anti-social behaviour.

# Prevention – This action uses community engagement, intelligence, training and development and the targeting of hotspots, attempting to prevent unacceptable behaviour from occurring.
# Response – A timely and effective response to anti-social behaviour is vital. Police provide ownership, leadership and coordination to apprehend offenders.
# Resolution – Identifying the underlying issues that cause anti-social behaviour and resolve these issues with the help of the community. Offenders are successfully prosecuted.

=== Japan ===
The 1970&#x27;s, brought attention to a social and historical phenomenon called hikikomori. Often called the lost generation, with pervasive and severe social withdrawal and anti-social tendencies. Individuals with hikikomori, are commonly in their 20&#x27;s or 30&#x27;s, avoiding as much social interaction as possible. Japanese psychologist and leading expert on the topic, Tamaki Saito, was one of the first to present that approximately 1% of the country&#x27;s population was considered hikikomori at the time. Today, it is still existent in Japan taking on new forms of seclusion by using digital tools, such as video games and internet chatting, to replace social interaction. The term Hikikomori has since been used throughout the world, in Asia, Europe, North and South America, Africa and Australia.

<text>Hiram Blanchard (January 17, 1820 – December 17, 1874) was a Nova Scotia lawyer, politician, and the first premier of Nova Scotia. Blanchard won election to the Nova Scotia legislative assembly in Inverness in 1859 as a Liberal.

==Early life==
Hiram Blanchard was born in West River, Nova Scotia, on January 17, 1820, to father Jonathan Blanchard and mother Sarah Goggins. Hiram attended the same school as his brother, Jotham Blanchard, Pictou Academy. After graduating, Blanchard began studying law at Guysborough, Nova Scotia, with future Nova Scotia House of Assembly member William Frederick DesBarres and was admitted to the bar as an attorney at age 21 in November 1841. Marrying Eliza Cantrell in 1842, he was admitted to the bar as a barrister in April 1843. Shortly after his admission to the bar, Blanchard opened up a law office in the small seaside village of Port Hood, Nova Scotia, practising in the law courts of Antigonish and Guysborough. In a short time, Blanchard gained a reputation amongst those in the legal profession for his skill in examining witnesses and clear presentation of facts.

In 1860, Blanchard moved to Halifax and became engaged in a partnership with Jonathan McCully, then Solicitor General and railway commissioner in the government of Joseph Howe. There, he argued against characters such as James MacDonald, the future federal Minister of Justice and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. Charles James Townshend, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, observed the courtroom encounters of McCully and Blanchard, commenting &quot;... it was delightful and instructive to listen to [their] forensic battle. Both were men of high and honourable character, incapable of any unworthy schemes to win their cases.&quot; In 1870, Blanchard became partners with Nicholas Meagher, future Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.

==Political career==
In 1860, William Young left politics to become chief justice of Nova Scotia. Blanchard had been very reluctant to become involved in politics until up to just before this time. The 1859 Nova Scotia election was largely influenced between the ongoing squabbles between Roman Catholic and Protestant populations, but Hiram Blanchard&#x27;s election win for the Liberals in his constituency of Inverness was based on a platform of &quot;equal rights to all, proscription of none, favouritism to none&quot;. Blanchard rose above religious quarrels and managed to win in a Roman Catholic community, even though he was a Presbyterian himself. In the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, Blanchard drew particular attention to the plight of the insane and the deaf, two disadvantaged groups in Nova Scotia at the time. Although he supported the free schooling initiative of Premier Charles Tupper, Blanchard objected to the idea that schools should be governed by a council made up of members of the Executive Council of Nova Scotia.

Blanchard supported the idea of confederation, and after Nova Scotia became a part of Canada in 1867, he became attorney-general and leader of the Conservative Party government, as the position of leader of the government had been vacated by Charles Tupper following his run for federal politics. However, Blanchard was in his new-found position for less than three months. In the September 1867 provincial election, the issue of Nova Scotia&#x27;s entry to the confederation led to the government&#x27;s demise in favour of William Annand&#x27;s Anti-Confederation Party, and in the newly elected Assembly, only two members, Blanchard included, supported the idea of confederation. In 1868, Blanchard&#x27;s re-election to his constituency of Inverness was declared invalid as he had recently been appointed the legal advisor for the federal government in his province. In the subsequent by-election, Blanchard was defeated. In the 1871 election, he was once again elected, serving as leader of the opposition until his death on December 17, 1874, at Halifax. Blanchard was survived by his four daughters and wife.

<text>Wieselburg (Central Bavarian: &quot;Wieslbuag&quot;) is a town in Lower Austria, Austria, located near the River Erlauf. Its name roughly translates to castle where two rivers meet, as there are two rivers that run together to create the Erlauf. Its population is approximately 4,200 (including surrounding villages).

A brewery, an agricultural college and research institute (HBLFA Francisco Josephinum), a college of higher education (&quot;Fachhochschule&quot;), and one of the oldest churches north of the Alps dating from AD 976 are located in the town. Wieselburg was made a town 1000 years later, in 1976.
Annually in the ending of June beginning of July an agricultural fair, Wieselburger Messe, takes place.

<text>Alpinia is a genus of flowering plants in the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. Species are native to Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, where they occur in tropical and subtropical climates. Several species are cultivated as ornamental plants.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was erected by the Scottish botanist William Roxburgh in 1810, and published in the journal Asiatic Researches. It is named after Prospero Alpini, a 17th-century Italian botanist who specialized in exotic plants. Species of the genus are known generally as shell gingers.

== Description ==
These herbs lack true stems, but have pseudostems usually up to about long which are composed of the overlapping leaf sheaths. A few species have been known to reach . They grow from thick rhizomes. The leaves are lance-shaped to oblong. The inflorescence takes the form of a spike, a panicle, or a raceme. It may be hooded in bracts and bracteoles. The flower has a shallowly toothed calyx which is sometimes split on one side. The flower corolla is a cylindrical tube with three lobes at the mouth, the middle lobe larger and hoodlike in some taxa. There is one fertile stamen and two staminodes, which are often joined into a petal-like labellum, a structure that is inconspicuous in some species and quite showy in others. The fruit is a rounded, dry or fleshy capsule. The plants are generally aromatic due to their essential oils.

== Species ==
This is the largest genus in the ginger family, with 248 species and 2 hybrids accepted by Plants of the World Online . A number of those are commonly grown for their flowers, including red ginger, and others are used as spices, including Galangal.

<text>Elettaria is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. They are native to India and Sri Lanka, but cultivated and naturalized elsewhere. One member of the genus, &quot;E. cardamomum&quot;, is a commercially important spice used as a flavouring agent in many countries.

In 2018, several species were removed from &quot;Elettaria&quot; and placed in a new genus called &quot;Sulettaria&quot;. These species are recognized as of October 2018:

* &quot;Elettaria cardamomum&quot; - India
* &quot;Elettaria ensal&quot; . - Sri Lanka

These former species from Malaysia and Indonesia were reclassified into &quot;Sulettaria&quot; in 2018:

* &quot;Elettaria brachycalyx&quot; - Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria kapitensis&quot; - Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria linearicrista&quot; - Sarawak, Brunei
* &quot;Elettaria longipilosa&quot; - Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria longituba&quot; - Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia
* &quot;Eulettaria multiflora&quot; - Sumatra, Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria rubida&quot; - Sabah, Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria stoloniflora&quot; - Sarawak
* &quot;Elettaria surculosa&quot; - Sarawak

<text>Zingiber is a genus of flowering plants in the family Zingiberaceae. It is native to China, the Indian Subcontinent, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia, especially Thailand. It contains the true gingers, plants grown the world over for their culinary value. The most well known species are &quot;Z. officinale&quot; and &quot;Z. mioga&quot;, two garden gingers.

==Culinary==
Each ginger species has a different culinary usage; for example, myoga is valued for the stem and flowers. Garden ginger&#x27;s rhizome is the classic spice &quot;ginger&quot;, and may be used whole, candied (known commonly as crystallized ginger), or dried and powdered. Other popular gingers used in cooking include cardamom and turmeric, though neither of these examples is a &quot;true ginger&quot; – they belong to different genera in the family Zingiberaceae.

It is a slow-growing oak that lives in dry areas on the edges of fields, tops of ridges, and also grows in poor soils, and is resistant to rot, fire, and drought. Interbreeding occurs among white oaks, thus many hybrid species combinations occur. It is identifiable by the rounded cross-like shape formed by the leaf lobes and hairy underside of the leaves.

== Taxonomy ==
The specific epithet &quot;stellata&quot; is Latin for &quot;star&quot;; it is named this because the trichome hairs on the bottom of the leaves are stellate or star-shaped. Several variants of &quot;Q. stellata&quot; were named by American botanist Charles Sprague Sargent. The variety most recognised by the United States Forest Service is &quot;Q. stellata&quot; var. &quot;paludosa&quot; Sarg (delta post oak).

=== Varieties ===
Varieties include:
* var. &quot;margarettiae&quot; (Ashe) Sarg.
* var. &quot;paludosa&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;boyntonii&quot; (Beadle) Sarg.
* var. &quot;anomala&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;attenuata&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;araniosa&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;palmeri&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;parviloba&quot; Sarg.
* var. &quot;rufescens&quot; Sarg.

=== Hybrids ===
== Description ==
Post oak is a relatively small tree, typically tall and trunk in diameter, though occasional specimens reach tall and in diameter. The leaves have a very distinctive shape, with three perpendicular terminal lobes, shaped much like a Maltese cross. They are leathery, and tomentose (densely short-hairy) beneath. The branching pattern of this tree often gives it a rugged appearance. The acorns are long, and are mature in their first summer.

=== Similar species ===
Both &quot;Quercus stellata&quot; and &quot;Q. alba&quot; are in a section of &quot;Quercus&quot; called the white oaks. In the white oak section, &quot;Q. stellata&quot; is a sister taxon with &quot;Q. alba&quot;. &quot;Q. stellata&quot; is sold and distributed as white oak. One identifiable difference between the two trees is that &quot;Q. stellata&quot; is &#x27;hairy&#x27; on the underside of the leaf.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Q. stellata&quot; is found in the eastern and Midwestern United States both inland and along the coast, then in a narrow range along the eastern coast from Massachusetts to Florida, then westward to Texas, and inland to Iowa. Normally found at the edge of a forest, it typically grows in dry, sandy areas, deficient of nutrients.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Q. stellata&quot; has the ability to survive fires by having thicker bark. It is useful for fire surveys where the tree rings are used to get a fire history of an area. A tree ring survey of 36 trees in Illinois provided a 226-year tree ring record that indicated that many &quot;Q. stellata&quot; persisted through annual fire return intervals of 1.44 fires/year for over 100 years.

It is used for food for deer, turkeys, squirrels, and other rodents, but because the nuts contain tannin, it is toxic to cattle. A recent study in Kansas concluded that deer browsing reduces post-oak recruitment in canopy gaps generally in the sapling phase.

== Uses ==
Because of its ability to grow in dry sites, attractive crown, and strong horizontal branches, it is used in urban forestry. It is resistant to decay, so it is used for railroad ties, siding, planks, construction timbers, stair risers and treads, flooring, pulp, veneer, particle board, fuel, and its namesake fence posts. It is one of the most common types of wood used for Central Texas barbecue.

<doc id="521959" wikidata="Q2683359" url="?curid=521959" title="Head-marking language">
<text>A language is head-marking if the grammatical marks showing agreement between different words of a phrase tend to be placed on the heads (or nuclei) of phrases, rather than on the modifiers or dependents. Many languages employ both head-marking and dependent-marking, and some languages double up and are thus double-marking. The concept of head/dependent-marking was proposed by Johanna Nichols in 1986 and has come to be widely used as a basic category in linguistic typology.

==In English==
The concepts of head-marking and dependent-marking are commonly applied to languages that have richer inflectional morphology than English. There are, however, a few types of agreement in English that can be used to illustrate those notions. The following graphic representations of a clause, a noun phrase, and a prepositional phrase involve agreement. The three tree structures shown are those of a dependency grammar, as opposed to those of a phrase structure grammar:

Heads and dependents are identified by the actual hierarchy of words, and the concepts of head-marking and dependent-marking are indicated with the arrows. Subject-verb agreement, shown in the tree on the left, is a case of head-marking because the singular subject &quot;John&quot; requires the inflectional suffix &quot;-s&quot; to appear on the finite verb &quot;cheats&quot;, the head of the clause. The determiner-noun agreement, shown in the tree in the middle, is a case of dependent-marking because the plural noun &quot;houses&quot; requires the dependent determiner to appear in its plural form, &quot;these&quot;, not in its singular form, &quot;this&quot;. The preposition-pronoun agreement of case government, shown in the tree on the right, is also an instance of dependent-marking because the head preposition &quot;with&quot; requires the dependent pronoun to appear in its object form, &quot;him&quot;, not in its subject form, &quot;he&quot;.

==Noun phrases and verb phrases==
The distinction between head-marking and dependent-marking shows the most in noun phrases and verb phrases, which have significant variation among and within languages.

Languages may be head-marking in verb phrases and dependent-marking in noun phrases, such as most Bantu languages, or vice versa, and it has been argued that the subject rather than the verb is the head of a clause so &quot;head-marking&quot; is not necessarily a coherent typology. Still, languages that are head-marking in both noun and verb phrases are common enough to make the term useful for typological description.

==Geographical distribution==
Head-marked possessive noun phrases are common in the Americas, Melanesia, Afro-Asiatic languages (status constructus) and Turkic languages and infrequent elsewhere. Dependent-marked noun phrases have a complementary distribution and are frequent in Africa, Eurasia, Australia, and New Guinea, the only area in which both types overlap appreciably. Double-marked possession is rare but found in languages around the Eurasian periphery such as Finnish, in the Himalayas, and along the Pacific Coast of North America. Zero-marked possession is also uncommon, with instances mostly found near the equator, but it does not form any true clusters.

The head-marked clause is common in the Americas, Australia, New Guinea, and the Bantu languages but is very rare elsewhere. The dependent-marked clause is common in Eurasia and Northern Africa, sparse in South America, and rare in North America. In New Guinea, it clusters in the Eastern Highlands and in Australia in the south, east, and interior with the very old Pama-Nyungan family. Double-marking is moderately well attested in the Americas, Australia, and New Guinea, and the southern fringe of Eurasia (chiefly in the Caucasian languages and Himalayan mountain enclaves), and it is particularly favored in Australia and the westernmost Americas. The zero-marked object is unsurprisingly common in Southeast Asia and Western Africa, two centers of morphological simplicity, but it is also very common in New Guinea and moderately common in Eastern Africa and Central America and South America, among languages of average or higher morphological complexity.

The Pacific Rim distribution of head-marking may reflect population movements beginning tens of thousands of years ago and founder effects. Kusunda has traces in the Himalayas, and there are Caucasian enclaves, both of which are perhaps remnants of typology preceding the spreads of interior Eurasian language families. The dependent-marking type is found everywhere but rare in the Americas, possibly another result of founder effects. In the Americas, all four types are found along the Pacific Coast, but in the East, only head-marking is common. Whether the diversity of types along the Pacific Coast reflects a great age or an overlay of more recent Eurasian colonizations on an earlier American stratum remains to be seen.

<doc id="521960" wikidata="Q2005050" url="?curid=521960" title="Dependent-marking language">
<text>A dependent-marking language has grammatical markers of agreement and case government between the words of phrases that tend to appear more on dependents than on heads. The distinction between head-marking and dependent-marking was first explored by Johanna Nichols in 1986, and has since become a central criterion in language typology in which languages are classified according to whether they are more head-marking or dependent-marking. Many languages employ both head and dependent-marking, but some employ double-marking, and yet others employ zero-marking. However, it is not clear that the head of a clause has anything to do with the head of a noun phrase, or even what the head of a clause is.

==In English==
English has few inflectional markers of agreement and so can be construed as zero-marking much of the time. Dependent-marking, however, occurs when a singular or plural noun demands the singular or plural form of the demonstrative determiner &quot;this/these&quot; or &quot;that/those&quot; and when a verb or preposition demands the subject or object form of a personal pronoun: &quot;I/me&quot;, &quot;he/him&quot;, &quot;she/her&quot;, &quot;they/them&quot;, &quot;who/whom&quot;. The following representations of dependency grammar illustrate some cases: 

Plural nouns in English require the plural form of a dependent demonstrative determiner, and prepositions require the object form of a dependent personal pronoun.

==In German==
Such instances of dependent-marking are a relatively rare occurrence in English, but dependent-marking occurs much more frequently in related languages, such as German. There, for instance, dependent-marking is present in most noun phrases. A noun marks its dependent determiner:

The noun marks the dependent determiner in gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and number (singular or plural). In other words, the gender and number of the noun determine the form of the determiner that must appear. Nouns in German also mark their dependent adjectives in gender and number, but the markings vary across determiners and adjectives. Also, a head noun in German can mark a dependent noun with the genitive case.

<doc id="521965" wikidata="Q4382730" url="?curid=521965" title="Continuity of government">
<text>Continuity of government (COG) is the principle of establishing defined procedures that allow a government to continue its essential operations in case of a catastrophic event such as nuclear war.

Continuity of government was developed by the British government before and during World War II to counter threats, such as that of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing during the Battle of Britain. The need for continuity of government plans gained new urgency with nuclear proliferation.

During and after the Cold War countries developed such plans to avoid (or minimize) confusion and disorder due to a power vacuum in the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

In the US, COG is no longer limited to nuclear emergencies; the Continuity of Operations Plan was activated following the September 11 attacks.

==By country==
===Australia===
During the years following the federation of Australia in 1901, several locations were considered for the national capital. One of the criteria used to assess sites was that they needed to be inland so that they could not be attacked from the sea. It was also believed that locations away from the coast would have a lower incidence of disease. During the Cold War the Office of National Assessments believed that it was unlikely that Australian cities would be attacked by the Soviet Union during a nuclear war.

The modern Australian Government has plans to enable the continuity of government. As of 2008, these formed part of &#x27;Plan Mercator&#x27;, which the government has described as aiming &quot;to minimise the impact of a national security emergency on critical government operations and provide for the rapid resumption of &#x27;near normal&#x27; government business under alternate arrangements until normal operations can be resumed&quot;.

Under the Australian system of government, there is not necessarily a requirement to maintain the Cabinet in a crisis. If the Prime Minister was killed in a disaster, the Governor-General would need to appoint their successor. A national unity government could also be formed in a major crisis.

A range of legislation, including the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot; and several health bills, include provisions that can be activated in response to emergencies. There are also plans for the Parliament of Australia to operate from another location if it is unable to sit at Parliament House in Canberra. These plans are classified.

&quot;The Canberra Times&quot; has reported that an Australian Government building in the Canberra suburb of Symonston houses communications systems that would be used to support the continuity of government if Plan Mercator was activated. The building was completed in 2007, and its secret function was disclosed as part of a job advertisement in 2008.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal and most of the state and territory parliaments cancelled scheduled sittings from March 2020. Federal parliamentary committees continued to operate virtually. The federal parliament met with only the number of members necessary to form a quorum present on several occasions between March and June 2020, and resumed full sittings from August that year. The arrangements in place from August allowed members of parliament who were unable to travel to Canberra to participate virtually, but these members were unable to vote in proceedings.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison arranged to be secretly appointed to hold several ministerial positions during 2020 and 2021, justifying his appointment as the Minister for Finance and Minister for Health as being necessary in case the ministers for portfolios were affected by COVID-19 and unable to perform their duties. Morrison&#x27;s appointment as Minister for Health was approved in March 2020 by the National Security Committee of Cabinet as part of measures taken in response to the pandemic, but was not publicly announced. His subsequent appointment to the other ministries was not known to other members of the government. An inquiry held into the matter during 2022 that was headed by Former High Court justice Virginia Bell found that Morrison had not needed to hold these ministries, as he could have been appointed &quot;in a matter of minutes&quot; if the ministers had been incapacitated. Morrison did not use the powers available to him as Finance or Health minister.

===Canada===
Canada built numerous nuclear bunkers across the country, nicknamed &quot;Diefenbunkers&quot; in a play on the last name of then-Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In 2016, the Privy Council Office made an agreement with the Department of National Defence to open two bunkers for government officials amid the ongoing North Korean nuclear crisis.

===China===


The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) once operated Underground Project 131, intended to be the PLA headquarters in Hubei during a nuclear conflict. Built due to the Sino-Soviet split during that portion of the Cold War, in 1981, the Project 131 site was turned over to the civilian authorities of the prefecture-level city of Xianning, where it is located.

===Czech Republic===
The K-116 facility under Zlíchov hill in western Prague was designated to house the Czechoslovak government in case of nuclear attack (together with the K-9 facility in Jihlava) and might still be used as the emergency headquarters of the Czech government and military.

===Denmark===
During the Cold War, Denmark built two bunker complexes, named REGAN Vest and REGAN Øst (Danish: &quot;REGeringsANlæg&quot;, translated: &quot;Government Complex West and Government Complex East&quot;), in Jutland and Zealand respectively. The idea was to have half of the government and the royal family in one bunker, and the other half in the other, allowing continuity of government, even if one of the bunkers were destroyed or cut off.

===France===

The &quot;Centre d&#x27;opération des forces aériennes stratégiques&quot; (COFAS) is a hardened command centre for French nuclear forces at Taverny Air Base in Taverny, Val d&#x27;Oise. The alternate national command center is located at Mont Verdun near Lyon.

The hardened headquarters of &quot;Force océanique stratégique&quot; (FOST), France&#x27;s nuclear SSBN fleet, is at Brest, Finistère.

===Germany===
Germany operated a government bunker (Regierungsbunker) to house the German government, parliament and all federal personnel needed to keep the government working in the event of war or severe crisis. It was decommissioned in 1997.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the National Security Committee (NSC) is the conduit for officials to communicate with the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) and/or cabinet members if the normal channel of communication with their minister became unavailable. Drafts of emergency powers legislation have been drawn up in secret, including legislation to deal with circumstances such as an attack on cabinet involving numerous deaths.

During the period of the Cold War, it was envisaged that cabinet ministers, senior civil servants and military advisers would use an underground nuclear bunker at Custume Barracks in Athlone in the event of a nuclear exchange. The bunker was equipped with a command and control centre with communications equipment – which had a hotline to the British government in Whitehall – a map room pointing out important areas for protection, kitchen, bedroom and bathroom facilities.

===Israel===
As of December 2003 an underground national crisis management center was being constructed at an undisclosed location in the Judaean Mountains under Jerusalem. Another command and control bunker is being built as part of the new Prime Minister&#x27;s Office complex in Givat Ram.

=== Poland ===
According to Constitution of Poland in case of death or inability to discharging duties of the President, his duties are discharged by Marshal of the Sejm (or if they are unable, the Marshal of the Senate).

After Smolensk air disaster in 2010 a lot of the highest state and army offices were emptied. Their duties were automatically taken over by respective deputies.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand government believes the most likely disaster scenario to affect the government is a large earthquake in Wellington. The government has plans to move Parliament and essential staff to Devonport Naval Base in Auckland if such an event occurs.

The website of the Governor-General of New Zealand notes that their constitutional role is to &quot;maintain the legitimacy and continuity of government by ensuring there is always a government in office with a democratic mandate to govern&quot;.

The New Zealand National Crisis Management Centre is located under the &quot;Beehive&quot; building in Wellington. An Alternate National Crisis Management Centre is in Auckland, and would be activated if the facility in Wellington was damaged, if multiple crises were occurring or if the government is required to relocate to Auckland.

===Norway===
The Norwegian government operates a nuclear bunker called Sentralanlegget in Buskerud County. The bunker is meant to accommodate the Norwegian royal family and the government in case of a nuclear/military attack on the nation, and also function as a wartime headquarters. There is also a bunker beneath Høyblokka in downtown Oslo.

===Soviet Union and Russia===

In the public domain very little is known about Russia&#x27;s COG plans. One sprawling underground facility residing in tunnels cut into Mount Yamantau is likely to be related to the survival of Russia&#x27;s government, given its size and decades long construction history, with a construction start during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev (1964–82). KGB defector Colonel Oleg Gordievsky states that an organization, known as Directorate 15, was (or is) tasked with building and maintaining a network of hundreds of underground command bunkers for the Soviet leadership; this includes the vast site beneath Yamantau Mountain, which is often called Mezhgorye / Межго́рье after the closed city that is located nearby. However, there is speculation, due to its proximity to Chelyabinsk-70, that Yamantau is a 400-square-mile underground complex which houses nuclear warheads, missiles, launch controls, and several nuclear weapons factories designed to continue production after a hypothetical nuclear war begins.

The second command and control center in the Urals, after Yamantau, is similarly speculated to be underground and located near, or under, Kosvinsky Kamen. The site is believed to host the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces alternate command post, a post for the general staff built to compensate for the vulnerability of older Soviet era command posts in the Moscow region. In spite of this, the primary command posts for the Strategic Rocket Forces remains Kuntsevo in Moscow and the secondary is the Kosvinsky Mountain in the Urals. The facility at Kosvinsky, finished in early 1996, was designed to resist US earth-penetrating warheads and serves a similar role as the American Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

Further command centers, according to globalsecurity.org, include one near Chekhov, which is the Russian General Staff wartime command post, buried deep underground, and Sharapovo(ru) about south of Moscow, built in the 1950s, Sharapovo is believed to have been the primary backup command center for the Soviet era leadership. Both Chekhov and Sharapovo are each suggested to have the capability to accommodate about 30,000 individuals, As an alternative to Sharapovo, a secondary political leadership base is located at Chaadayevka, some 650 kilometers southeast of Moscow near the city of Penza.

There is also said to be as many as 12 underground levels beneath the Russian capital of Moscow to protect the government in the Kremlin, known as the Main Directorate of special programs of the President (Glavnoye Upravlenie Specialnih Program: GUSP) the direct successor of the 15th Directorate of the KGB, which was established in 1977, GUSP is said to oversee, amongst other sites, a parallel track line alongside the Moscow metro, known as the &#x27;Kremlin line&#x27; Metro-2 or D-6 to be used in an emergency. Two destinations of this system are suggested to be the old KGB headquarters, now the FSB headquarters, at Lubyanka Square, and the second being regarded as an enormous underground leadership bunker adjacent to Moscow State University. Another alleged subterranean destination, apart from the aforementioned underground town at Ramenki/Moscow State University is &quot;Vnukovo-2&quot; airport. Despite official Russian state ambiguity, it is speculated that many of the Moscow bunkers are linked by an underground railway line.

===Sweden===
In case of war, the Riksdag can convene somewhere else than in the capital, and if necessary, a War Delegation will replace the Riksdag. The War Delegation consists of the Speaker and 50 members of the Riksdag. The government can put a number of enabling acts in force to regulate for example rationing, export and seizing of property. If the government is unable to carry out its duties the Riksdag may decide on the formation of a new government. Likewise, if the Riksdag and the War Delegation are unable to carry out its duties, the government can assume the powers of the Riksdag, but with some limitations.

During the Cold War, the Klara skyddsrum (&quot;Klara shelter&quot; or &quot;Klara bunker&quot;) was built underneath Stockholm. The bunker is designed to accommodate two thirds of the government and between 8,000 and 12,000 civilians in the case of a military attack on Stockholm. It is designed as a very large, two-story oval, with multiple entrances. During peacetime, parts of it are used as a parking garage. Sweden built over 65,000 fallout shelters in regular houses, and every county had at least one large hard-rock underground bunker that controlled a number of smaller bunkers that were located in the municipalities.

===Turkey===
There is little public knowledge about continuity of government in Turkey. The cabinet and presidential offices, based in the capital of Ankara, have secondary sites in Istanbul and İzmir.

===United Kingdom===

The primary British COG headquarters is at the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall. The Central Government War Headquarters was previously maintained in a quarry complex near Corsham, Wiltshire. The above-ground support facility was RAF Rudloe Manor.

Service command centres are Northwood for the Royal Navy Trident SSBN force, and RAF High Wycombe for the Royal Air Force.

===United States===

Continuity of the national government was first threatened in late 1776, when British forces advanced toward the Continental capital at Philadelphia. On December 9, the Continental Congress passed a resolution in anticipation of a British capture:

&quot;Resolved&quot;: That in case this Congress shall be under the necessity of removing from Philadelphia, it shall be adjourned to Baltimore.

The Congress was adjourned as planned three days later. Other relocations followed during the course of the Revolutionary War.

For most of its existence, the United States operated without a standing continuity plan. When British forces burned Washington in 1814, Secretary of State James Monroe received only a few hours&#x27; notice to remove the government records. Although his staff saved many valuable records, much was nonetheless destroyed, and the next administration encountered a great deal of confusion.

In 1952, President Truman ordered all federal offices to develop their own continuity plans for the event of a civil defense emergency. Plans have been maintained and adapted since then, at times requiring the construction of secret facilities such as the emergency Congress facility in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. The current continuity policy is defined in National Security Policy Directive 51 and its implementation plan. The continuity plan was activated for the first time during the September 11, 2001 attacks and then again during the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Presidential Emergency Action Documents (PEADs) are draft classified executive orders, proclamations, and messages to Congress that are prepared for the President of the United States to exercise or expand powers in anticipation of a range of emergency hypothetical worst-case scenarios, so that they are ready to sign and put into effect the moment one of those scenarios comes to pass.

The United States presidential line of succession is the order in which officials of the United States federal government assume the powers and duties of the office of president of the United States if the incumbent president becomes incapacitated, dies, resigns, or is removed from office. It was adopted in 1947, and last revised in 2006. The designated survivor is an individual in the line of succession, chosen to stay away from events such as State of the Union addresses and presidential inaugurations.

<text>Aigun (; Manchu: &quot;aihūn&quot;; ) was a historic Chinese town in northern Manchuria, situated on the right bank of the Amur River, some south (downstream) from the central urban area of Heihe (which is across the Amur from the mouth of the Zeya River and Blagoveschensk).

The Chinese name of the town, which literally means &quot;Bright Jade&quot;, was a transliteration of the Manchu (or Ducher) name of the town. The current Mainland Chinese pronunciation Ài Huī does not reflect this, unlike the Taiwanese pronunciation which still follows the Old National Pronunciation Ài Hún.

Today the former city of Aigun is called Aihui Town ( &quot;aihūn hoton&quot;) and is part of Aihui District, which in turn is part of the prefecture-level city of Heihe. Heihe is one of the major cities in Heilongjiang Province.

==History==

The predecessor of Aigun was a town of the indigenous Ducher people of the Amur Valley, located on the left (northeastern - now Russian) bank of the Amur River. The site of this town, whose name was reported by the Russian explorer Yerofey Khabarov as Aytyun () in 1652, is currently known to archaeologists as the Grodekovo site (), after the nearby village of Grodekovo. It is thought to have been populated since around the end of the 1st or the beginning of the 2nd millennium AD.

Some sources report a Chinese presence on the middle Amur – a fort existed at Aigun for about 20 years during the Yongle era on the left (northwestern) shore of the Amur downstream from the mouth of the Zeya River. This Ming Dynasty Aigun was located on the opposite bank to the later Aigun that was relocated during the Qing Dynasty.
The Ducher town was probably vacated when the Duchers were evacuated by the Manchu Chinese Qing Dynasty to the Sungari or Hurka in the mid-1650s. In 1683-85 the Manchus re-used the site as a base for their campaign against the Russian fort of Albazin.

After the capture of Albazin in 1685 or 1686, the Manchus relocated the town to a new site on the right (southwestern) bank of the Amur, about downstream from the original site. The new site occupied the location of the former village of a Daurian chief named Tolga. The city became known primarily under its Manchu name Saghalien Ula Hotun or Hoton (Manchu: &quot;Sahaliyan Ula Hoton&quot;), and sometimes also under the Chinese translation of this name, Heilongjiang Cheng (). Both names mean &quot;Black River City&quot;, but by the 19th century the name &quot;Aigun&quot; again became more current in the western languages.

For a number of years after 1683, Aigun served as the capital (the seat of the Military Governor) of Heilongjiang Province, until the capital was moved to Nenjiang (Mergen) in 1690, and later to Qiqihar. Aigun, however, remained the seat of the Deputy Lieutenant-General (&quot;Fu dutong&quot;), responsible for a large district covering much of the Amur Valley within the province of Heilongjiang as it existed in those days.

As a part of a nationwide Sino-French cartographic program, Aigun (or, rather, Saghalien Ula hoton) was visited ca. 1709 by the Jesuits Jean-Baptiste Régis, Pierre Jartoux, and Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli, who found it a well-defended town, serving as the base of a Manchu river fleet controlling the Amur River region. Surrounded by numerous villages on the fertile riverside plain, the town was well provisioned with foodstuffs.
It was at Aigun in May 1858 that Nikolay Muravyov concluded the Aigun Treaty, according to which the left bank of the Amur River was conceded to Russia.

During the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, for a few weeks Aigun was the center of military action directed against the Russians. On July22, Aigun was captured by Russian troops.

In 1913 Aigun became the county seat of the newly created Aigun County (, &quot;Àihuī Xiàn&quot;), which was renamed Aihui County (, &quot;Àihuī Xiàn&quot;, the pronunciation remained unchanged) in December 1956.

The Manchus of the Chinese capital Peking (now known as Beijing) were influenced by the Chinese dialect spoken in the area to the point where pronouncing Manchu sounds was hard for them, and they pronounced Manchu according to Chinese phonetics, while in contrast, the Manchus of Aigun could both pronounce Manchu sounds properly and mimick the sinicised pronunciation of Peking Manchus, since they learned the Pekinese pronunciation from either studying in Peking or from officials sent to Aigun from the capital, and they could tell them apart, using the Chinese influenced Pekinese pronunciation when demonstrating that they were better educated or their superior stature in society.

On November15, 1980, Heihe City was created, and on June6, 1983, Aihui County was abolished and merged into the Heihe City.

==Commemoration==
There are a number of historical sites in today&#x27;s Aihui Town (30 km south of downtown Heihe) related to the historical Aigun. They include Aihui Ancient City (), Aihui Heroic Defenders&#x27; of the Fatherland Garden (, &quot;Àihuī Wèiguó Yīngxióng Yuán&quot;), and Aihui History Museum (, &quot;Àihuī Lìshǐ Chénliè Guǎn&quot;).

<text>The Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange Program, also known by the acronym MATRIX, was a U.S. federally funded data mining system originally developed for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement described as a tool to identify terrorist subjects.

The system was reported to analyze government and commercial databases to find associations between suspects or to discover locations of or completely new &quot;suspects&quot;. The database and technologies used in the system were housed by Seisint, a Florida-based company since acquired by LexisNexis.

The Matrix program was shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.

==History==

Matrix was the brainchild of Hank Asher, a businessman in the data aggregation field. Asher reportedly contacted Florida police immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks, claiming he could find the hijackers as well as other potential terrorists. Asher reportedly offered to make available the database and technology that could do the job quickly, for free, supplied by the company he owned and operated: Seisint.

Control of the system was handed over to law enforcement officials, although Seisint continued to house and operate it on their behalf. After a demonstration of the system at the White House in January 2003 Matrix received US$4 million in grants from the U.S. Justice Department and the program was earmarked US$8 million by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The program snowballed, as states signed up to participate, including Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Ohio and Utah. California and Texas joined then exited the program, citing privacy and security concerns. The U.S. federal government and the CIA was cited as likely future users.

The program&#x27;s similarity to the Total Information Awareness (TIA) federally funded initiative that was terminated following public concerns contributed to Matrix&#x27;s demise. Matrix came under scrutiny by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) which made Freedom of Information Act requests in Florida, where the program originated, and to the federal government on 30 October 2003. The ACLU followed this up with simultaneous information requests in Connecticut, Michigan, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania for information about those states&#x27; participation in Matrix.

The ACLU&#x27;s requests sought to find out the information sources that Matrix was drawing upon, who had access to the database and how it is being used. As well as the funding and operations described here, the ACLU&#x27;s requests revealed that Matrix would perform an almost identical function to the banned TIA. Matrix would bind together government and commercial databases to allow federal and state law enforcement entities to conduct detailed searches on individuals.

Public revelation of the projects funding caused an uproar in the media and states began withdrawing their support. The Matrix program was finally shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.

Seisint retained the technology used to operate Matrix. Both Seisint and its Matrix technology are now owned by LexisNexis.

==Function==

The Matrix website stated that the data would include criminal histories, driver&#x27;s license data, vehicle registration records, and public data record entries. Other data was thought to include credit histories, driver&#x27;s license photographs, marriage and divorce records, social security numbers, dates of birth, and the names and addresses of family members, neighbors and business associates. All of this information is available to the government without the need for a warrant. The ACLU pointed out that the type of data that the Matrix compiles could be expanded to include information in commercial databases encompasses such as purchasing habits, magazine subscriptions, income and job histories.

Matrix would combine these government records and information from commercial databases in a data warehouse. Dossiers would be reviewed by specialized software to identify anomalies using &#x27;mathematical analysis&#x27;. When anomalies are spotted, they would be scrutinized by personnel who would search for evidence of terrorism or other crimes.

Like the TIA, Matrix would use data mining where searches for patterns in this data (including the &#x27;anomalies&#x27;) would be used to identify individuals possibly involved in terrorist or other criminal activity. Congressional critic Paula B. Dockery pointed out that like the TIA, this kind of &#x27;data mining&#x27; may be ineffective, and have severe downsides, including its privacy costs.

Data from Matrix would be transferred through the Regional Information Sharing Systems network, an existing secure law enforcement network used to transmit sensitive information among law enforcement agencies. The network was linked to High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, United States Attorneys&#x27; Offices, other federal agencies and several state law enforcement systems.

<doc id="521970" wikidata="Q132187" url="?curid=521970" title="Oxonium ion">
<text>In chemistry, an oxonium ion is any cation containing an oxygen atom that has three bonds and 1+ formal charge. The simplest oxonium ion is the hydronium ion ().

==Alkyloxonium==
Hydronium is one of a series of oxonium ions with the formula R&quot;n&quot;H3−&quot;n&quot;O+.
Oxygen is usually pyramidal with an sp3 hybridization. Those with &quot;n&quot; = 1 are called primary oxonium ions, an example being protonated alcohol (e.g. methanol). In acidic media, the oxonium functional group produced by protonating an alcohol can be a leaving group in the E2 elimination reaction. The product is an alkene. Extreme acidity, heat, and dehydrating conditions are usually required. Other hydrocarbon oxonium ions are formed by protonation or alkylation of alcohols or ethers (R−C−−R1R2).

Secondary oxonium ions have the formula R2OH+, an example being protonated ethers.

Tertiary oxonium ions have the formula R3O+, an example being trimethyloxonium. Tertiary alkyloxonium salts are useful alkylating agents. For example, triethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate ()(), a white crystalline solid, can be used, for example, to produce ethyl esters when the conditions of traditional Fischer esterification are unsuitable. It is also used for preparation of enol ethers and related functional groups.
Oxatriquinane and oxatriquinacene are unusually stable oxonium ions, first described in 2008. Oxatriquinane does not react with boiling water or with alcohols, thiols, halide ions, or amines, although it does react with stronger nucleophiles such as hydroxide, cyanide, and azide.

==Oxocarbenium ions==
Another class of oxonium ions encountered in organic chemistry is the oxocarbenium ions, obtained by protonation or alkylation of a carbonyl group e.g. R−C=−R′ which forms a resonance structure with the fully-fledged carbocation R−−O−R′ and is therefore especially stable:
==Gold-stabilized species==

An unusually stable oxonium species is the gold complex tris[triphenylphosphinegold(I)]oxonium tetrafluoroborate, [(Ph3PAu)3O][BF4], where the intramolecular aurophilic interactions between the gold atoms are believed responsible for the stabilisation of the cation. This complex is prepared by treatment of Ph3PAuCl with Ag2O in the presence of NaBF4:

:3 Ph3PAuCl + Ag2O + NaBF4 → [(Ph3PAu)3O]+[BF4]− + 2 AgCl + NaCl

It has been used as a catalyst for the propargyl Claisen rearrangement.

==Relevance to natural product chemistry==
Complex bicyclic and tricyclic oxonium ions have been proposed as key intermediates in the biosynthesis of a series of natural products by the red algae of the genus &quot;Laurencia&quot;.
Several members of these elusive species have been prepared explicitly by total synthesis, demonstrating the possibility of their existence. The key to their successful generation was the use of a weakly coordinating anion (Krossing&#x27;s anion, [Al(pftb)4]−, pftb = perfluoro-&quot;tert&quot;-butoxy) as the counteranion. As shown in the example below, this was executed by a transannular halide abstraction strategy through the reaction of the oxonium ion precursor (an organic halide) with the silver salt of the Krossing&#x27;s anion Ag[Al(pftb)4]•CH2Cl2, generating the desired oxonium ion with simultaneous precipitation of inorganic silver halides. The resulting oxonium ions were characterized comprehensively by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at low temperature (−78 °C) with support from density functional theory computation.
These oxonium ions were also demonstrated to directly give rise to multiple related natural products by reacting with various nucleophiles, such as water, bromide, chloride, and acetate.

<text>Anne Heggtveit, (born January 11, 1939) is a former alpine ski racer from Canada. She was an Olympic gold medallist and double world champion in 1960.

==Early years==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, Heggtveit was raised in New Edinburgh, one of the oldest areas of the city. She was encouraged into alpine skiing by her father, Halvor Heggtveit, a Canadian cross-country champion who qualified for the Winter Olympics in 1932, but did not compete. Her parents had emigrated from Norway to North Dakota. She learned to ski at Camp Fortune ski area in the nearby Gatineau Hills of Quebec, northwest of Ottawa, and was a student at Lisgar Collegiate Institute in Ottawa. Heggtveit was a ski racing prodigy, invited at age seven to serve as a forerunner to a downhill race at Lake Placid in 1946.

==Racing career==
At the age of 15 in 1954, Heggtveit first gained international attention when she became the youngest winner ever of the Holmenkollen giant slalom event in Norway. She also won the slalom and giant slalom at the United States national junior championships, and finished ninth in the downhill and seventh in the slalom at the World Championships in March at Åre, Sweden. After leading the top half of the giant slalom, she fell twice near the finish was well back in 31st, which dropped her final placing in the combined to 14th.

Although Heggtveit suffered several injuries between 1955 and 1957, she still earned a spot on Canada&#x27;s Olympic team at age 17 in 1956 at Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy.

At a time when Europeans dominated alpine skiing, Heggtveit was inspired by the breakthrough performance of teammate Lucile Wheeler of Quebec, who won Olympic bronze in the downhill in 1956, and three medals at the World Championships in 1958 at Bad Gastein, Austria. Wheeler won gold in the downhill and giant slalom events, and took silver in the combined. Heggtveit finished in the top ten in three events, with an eighth in the slalom, seventh in the downhill, and sixth in the combined.

At the 1960 Winter Olympic Games in Squaw Valley, California, Heggtveit won Canada&#x27;s first-ever Olympic skiing gold medal. Her victory in the Olympic slalom also made her the first non-European to win the world championship in slalom and combined. Heggtveit was the first North American to win the Arlberg-Kandahar Trophy, the most prestigious and classic event in alpine skiing.

==Honors==
Heggtveit was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada&#x27;s outstanding athlete of 1960. She was also the first recipient of the John Semmelink Memorial Award in November 1961, named for her fallen teammate. Her performance on the world stage was again recognized in 1976 when she was made a member of the Order of Canada, the country&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

Heggtveit was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1960, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame in 1971, and was among the first group inducted into the new Canadian Ski Hall of Fame in 1982.

Heggtveit has a road named after her at the Blue Mountain Ski Resort in the Town of the Blue Mountains, west of Collingwood, Ontario. She also has a ski run named after her at Camp Fortune, an extremely difficult double black diamond run.

Anne Heggtveit was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

She was in the first induction of the Lisgar Collegiate Institute Athletic Wall of Fame, as part of the 160th Anniversary celebrations.

==Personal==
Following her competitive career, Heggtveit married James Ross Hamilton in August 1961, and resided in Quebec. They had two children and later relocated to nearby Vermont in the United States. She was later an accountant and photographer.

She is sister to Alexander Heggtveit, MD, cardiac pathologist with ties to Brooklyn, NY, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Seaforth, Ontario, and great-aunt to Katie Heggtveit, granddaughter of Alexander, a social entrepreneur with ties to Toronto, Ontario, currently living in Nashville, Tennessee since 2023, recently inducted into the Toronto Sport Hall of Honor.

<doc id="521975" wikidata="Q3366310" url="?curid=521975" title="Confederation Party">
<text>Confederation Party was a term for the parties supporting Canadian confederation in the British colonies of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland in the 1860s when politics became polarized between supporters and opponents of Confederation. The Confederation parties were accordingly opposed by Anti-Confederation parties in those three jurisdictions. A conference was held on September 1, 1864, in Charlottetown when the Province of Canada became interested in it. John A. Macdonald was a huge promoter of Confederation and even made an alliance with his political rival, George Brown to make it happen.

In New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the Confederation parties became Conservative parties aligned with the federal Liberal-Conservative Party of Sir John A. Macdonald (generally known simply as &quot;Conservatives&quot;), while Anti-Confederation parties became Liberals. This approximated the political dichotomy that existed prior to Confederation although, because of the realignment, some former Liberals became Conservatives and vice versa. 

The acceptance of the Confederation Party was greatly influenced by the American Civil War. Other reasons were an aggressive American foreign policy and the Fenian Raids of 1866. 

Some of the Maritime provinces were worried that the autonomy would be weakened if they took up the Confederation. It was also feared that the French-Canadian interests would be weakened if the Confederation was embraced in Canada East (modern-day Quebec).

<doc id="521976" wikidata="Q6187015" url="?curid=521976" title="Jesselyn Radack">
<text>Jesselyn Radack (born December 12, 1970) is an American national security and human rights attorney known for her defense of whistleblowers, journalists, and hacktivists. She defended CIA whistleblower John Kiriakou and NSA whistleblowers Edward Snowden, Thomas Drake, and Daniel Hale, all of whom were charged under the Espionage Act of 1917.

She graduated from Brown University and Yale Law School, and began her career as an Honors Program attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice.

She later became a whistleblower in the Justice Department&#x27;s first major terrorism prosecution after 9/11. Radack resigned in protest, and her experience is chronicled in her memoir, &quot;Traitor: The Whistleblower and the &quot;American Taliban&quot;&quot; and in the Emmy-nominated documentary &quot;Silenced&quot;.

After resigning from the Justice Department, Radack worked for Alan Grayson from 2006 until he was elected to Congress in 2008. She then became the Director of National Security and Human Rights at the Government Accountability Project from 2008 until 2015, and is currently the director of the Whistleblower and Source Protection Program at the Institute for Public Accuracy. She has been widely published and quoted regarding whistleblowing, torture, surveillance, Internet freedom, and privacy. She is a contributing writer for &quot;Salon&quot; and her writing has appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Legal Times&quot;, and various law journals. She appears in the press, including on the major American television networks as well as NPR, PBS, CNN, BBC, and Al Jazeera English.

==Early life and education==
Radack was born in Washington, D.C., and attended Wilde Lake High School and Brown University. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year and graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; in 1992 as a triple major with honors in all three majors. While in college, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

In 1995 Radack graduated from Yale Law School and, through the Attorney General&#x27;s Honors Program, joined the Department of Justice. When the Department&#x27;s Professional Responsibility Advisory Office was created in 1999, she served as a legal advisor until leaving Justice in April 2002.

==John Walker Lindh case==

Radack worked at the Justice Department&#x27;s Professional Responsibility Advisory Office, which advises department lawyers on ethics issues. An attorney in the counterterrorism section of the Criminal Division inquired about the ethical propriety of interrogating John Walker Lindh, dubbed the &quot;American Taliban&quot;. Lindh was captured during the United States invasion of Afghanistan. With her director&#x27;s approval, she advised that such an interrogation would violate the Justice Department&#x27;s ethics rule governing contact with a represented person and was not authorized by law. During this time, a photo circulated in the news of Lindh naked, blindfolded, and bound to a stretcher with duct tape. Radack considered this to be torture.

After the FBI interrogated Lindh despite her office&#x27;s advice, the counterterrorism attorney sought further guidance. She and her director concluded that the FBI committed an ethics violation in their custodial interrogation of Lindh without counsel. They further advised that the fruits of Lindh&#x27;s interrogation could be used for intelligence-gathering purposes, but not for criminal prosecution. When the Justice Department prosecuted Lindh against the advice of the ethics office, Radack alleged that her boss attempted to conceal the advice when the judge ordered its production.

===Initial inquiry into Lindh case===
On December 7, 2001, Radack received an inquiry from Justice Department counterterrorism prosecutor John DePue, regarding the ethical propriety of interrogating Lindh in Afghanistan without Lindh&#x27;s legal representative being present. He told her that Lindh&#x27;s father had retained a lawyer for his son; Lindh was not aware of this arrangement. Radack responded that interrogating him was not authorized by law. The principle at issue was that a person represented by a lawyer cannot be contacted by agents of the Justice Department, including the FBI, without permission of that lawyer. According to Radack, the advice she gave had been approved by Claudia Flynn, then head of PRAO, and Joan Goldfrank, a senior PRAO attorney.

The FBI proceeded to question Lindh without Lindh&#x27;s lawyer having given permission. DePue informed Radack of the interrogation on December 10, 2001, and she advised him that Lindh&#x27;s &quot;interview may have to be sealed or only used for national security purposes; however, I don&#x27;t have enough information yet to make that recommendation&quot;.

Radack continued to research the issue until December 20, 2001, when Flynn told her to drop the matter, because Lindh had been &quot;Mirandized&quot;. It was later learned that the FBI agent who read Lindh the Miranda warning had, when noting the right to counsel, ad-libbed: &quot;Of course, there are no lawyers here&quot;.

===U.S. government statements on Lindh&#x27;s legal rights===
On January 15, 2002, five weeks after the interrogation, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that a criminal complaint was being filed against Lindh. &quot;The subject here is entitled to choose his own lawyer&quot;, Ashcroft said, &quot;and to our knowledge, has not chosen a lawyer at this time&quot;. On February 5, 2002, Ashcroft announced Lindh&#x27;s indictment, saying that his rights &quot;have been carefully, scrupulously honored&quot;.

In June 2002, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published internal emails between Radack and a counterterrorism attorney in which Radack and her supervisor concluded that the FBI plans to interrogate Lindh without counsel would violate ethics guidelines and were not authorized by law. In late 2003, the Supreme Court confirmed Radack&#x27;s position that U.S. citizens designated as &quot;enemy combatants&quot; have a right to counsel in the case &quot;Hamdi v. Rumsfeld&quot;.

In early 2005 Radack recalled her reaction to a different Ashcroft statement—that Lindh&#x27;s rights had been &quot;carefully, scrupulously guarded&quot;—more starkly : &quot;I knew that wasn&#x27;t true&quot;.

===Poor performance review===
On February 4, 2002, the day before the Lindh indictment was announced, Flynn gave Radack an unscheduled, &quot;blistering&quot; performance evaluation, despite Radack having received a merit raise the year before. The evaluation covered December 27, 2000, to September 30, 2001, two months prior to the Lindh inquiry, and did not mention the Lindh case, but it criticized her legal judgment in issues related to the case, as well as in other matters. Flynn had not yet signed the review. She advised Radack to find another job, or the review would be put in Radack&#x27;s official personnel file. Radack, who had planned on being a career civil servant, soon found a new job outside of government, at the law firm Hawkins, Delafield &amp; Wood, from which she was effectively fired in November 2002 for refusing to either sign an affidavit stating that she had not leaked the government documents, or resign.

===Missing emails===
On March 7, 2002, while Radack was still working at PRAO, the lead prosecutor in the Lindh case, Randy Bellows, messaged Radack that there was a court order for all of the Justice Department&#x27;s internal correspondence about Lindh&#x27;s interrogation. He said that he had two of her messages and asked if there were more.

Radack immediately became concerned that the court order had been deliberately concealed from her. She had written more than a dozen emails on the subject, and neither of the ones Bellows had received copies of reflected her fear that the FBI&#x27;s actions had been unethical and that Lindh&#x27;s confession, which was the basis for the criminal case, might have to be sealed. After checking the hard-copy file, Radack said the files were tampered with to include only three of her emails; official records indicated that only those three emails were received by the Lindh prosecutors, but which emails DOJ supplied to the court and when cannot be determined as the court records were sealed. Radack confided in a senior colleague, former U.S. Attorney Donald McKay, who examined the file and told her that it had been &quot;purged&quot;.

Which emails the Department of Justice supplied to the court, and when, cannot be determined directly because the court placed them under seal. In March 2003 investigative journalist Jane Mayer of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; reported that &quot;[a]n official list compiled by the prosecution confirms that the Justice Department did not hand over Radack&#x27;s most critical e-mail in which she questioned the viability of Lindh&#x27;s confession until after her confrontation with Flynn&quot;.

On December 31, 2003, Radack requested the court appoint a special prosecutor to probe the alleged suppression of the emails. The government responded that it had supplied the emails to the court in its initial response to the court order seeking them, i.e., on March 1, 2002. The description of the 24 documents (probably including duplicates) provided to the court at that time matches Radack&#x27;s emails, including the one that states interviewing Lindh is not authorized by law. DePue, the recipient of the emails, also had copies and states that they were submitted to the court. The judge rejected Radack&#x27;s request as &quot;impertinent&quot;.

In 2004 Radack filed suit against the government (see below). In 2005, the court found that &quot;[t]hough Flynn informed Radack that she would send the emails to Bellows, Radack maintains that she had a &#x27;good faith belief&#x27; that this never occurred...Radack was mistaken, for in filings submitted to the Virginia District Court on March 1, 2002, and March 11, 2002, Bellows turned over thirty-three PRAO-related documents, including Radack&#x27;s fourteen emails, ex parte and under seal, for in camera review&quot;.

===Disclosure to &quot;Newsweek&quot; of emails believed to have been purged===
Radack resigned from the Justice Department on April 5, 2002. In June 2002 she heard a broadcast on NPR stating that the department said they had never taken the position that Lindh was entitled to counsel during his interrogation. She later wrote, &quot;I knew this statement was not true. It also indicated to me that the Justice Department must not have turned over my e-mails to the Lindh court ... because I did not believe the Department would have the temerity to make public statements contradicted by its own court filings, even if those filings were &quot;in camera&quot;.&quot; She reasoned that &quot;disclosure of my e-mails would advance compliance with the Lindh court&#x27;s discovery order while also exposing gross mismanagement and abuse of authority by my superiors at the Justice Department.&quot; After hearing the broadcast, Radack sent the emails to Michael Isikoff, a &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter, who had been interviewed in the NPR story. He then wrote an article about the Lindh case emails, quoting Radack but not naming her as the source of what he called &quot;internal e-mails obtained by &quot;Newsweek&quot;&quot;.

Radack has said she did not turn the documents over to the court or prosecutors at the time she recovered them because she felt intimidated by Flynn, who had told her to drop the matter. Later, no longer working in government, she reasoned, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go to the court because Justice Department lawyers would argue (as they did when I eventually did try to tell my story to the court) that I had no standing. I couldn&#x27;t go to a Member of Congress because, as a resident of the District of Columbia, I didn&#x27;t have a voting representative. What I could do is disclose my story to the press--a judicially-sanctioned way of exposing wrongdoing under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which provides protection to federal government employees who blow the whistle on what they reasonably believe evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation; gross mismanagement; or an abuse of authority&quot;.

Radack and some others believe her disclosure of the emails may have contributed to the plea agreement that led to a sentence of 20 years instead of possible multiple life sentences for Lindh. The plea deal was reached on July 15, 2002, a month after the &quot;Newsweek&quot; article on the emails appeared online and just hours before the hearing to consider the motions to suppress the Lindh interviews was set to begin. According to Lindh defense attorneys, the prosecution first approached them about a plea deal around the beginning of June. On June 14, the day before the emails were disclosed, and June 17, the Lindh defense filed their arguments to suppress all the interviews conducted in Afghanistan, including the ones that Radack had advised might have to be suppressed. The defense reasoning was different from Radack&#x27;s; it did not assert that Lindh was represented by a lawyer at the time, which was the basis for Radack&#x27;s advice in the emails.

===Justice Department actions against Radack===
On June 19, 2002, the Lindh court ordered the Justice Department to file a pleading &quot;addressing whether any documents ordered protected by the Court were disclosed by any person bound by an Order of this court&quot;. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation of Radack that remained open for 15 months. No potential criminal charge was ever specified. Radack says an agent of the Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) told her new employer and coworkers that she was under criminal investigation and would steal client files.

Radack believes the OIG agent pressured her employer to fire her. The firm was initially supportive, but after it obtained phone records of calls between &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer Isikoff and the firm&#x27;s office showing that Radack appeared to be the leaker of government emails, that changed. A partner in the firm, which represented mainly government bond issuers, told her they could not be perceived to have an ex-government lawyer who broke confidence when she thought the client was wrong. When she continued to refuse to sign a statement that she did not leak the emails, she was placed on paid and then unpaid leave.

When Radack was granted unemployment benefits, her now-former employer was assisted by the Justice Department, she says, in challenging the benefits on the grounds of her alleged misconduct and insubordination. She won the appeal.

The Lindh court issued an order on November 6, 2002, concluding that Radack&#x27;s disclosure did not violate any order of the Court, but this order was not made available to Radack until two years later.

The Department of Justice notified Radack that the criminal investigation was closed on September 11, 2003. On October 31, 2003, the Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) sent letters to the bar associations of the two jurisdictions in which she was licensed to practice law referring her for a possible ethics violation. The referrals proposed that in disclosing the emails she may have knowingly revealed information protected by attorney-client privilege. There is disagreement about whether the government or the public is the client of government attorneys. Radack bypassed that issue by invoking the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), which she argues provides the legal basis for an exception to attorney-client privilege, i.e., for disclosure when permitted or authorized by law. The Justice Department responded that the WPA may not apply to former employees, and that it does not authorize any disclosure, only prevents retaliatory personnel actions for certain disclosures.

Radack has contrasted the way she was treated by the Department of Justice and the way the department attorneys who authored the memos giving a purported legal basis for waterboarding and other controversial interrogation methods were treated.

The criminal investigation and subsequent ethics referrals prevented Radack from finding suitable work as an attorney for years, she says. The Maryland Bar dismissed the referral February 23, 2005. At the District of Columbia Bar, the referral was not resolved until 2011.

Radack has said that one or more anonymous Justice Department officials &quot;smeared&quot; her in the media as a &quot;traitor&quot;, &quot;turncoat&quot;, and &quot;terrorist sympathizer&quot; &quot;to alienate me from all my neighbors, all my friends&quot;, sometimes specifying it was in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In May 2003, Eric Lichtblau reported at &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;Government officials suspect she is a turncoat who leaked documents on one of their most important investigations, the John Walker Lindh case.&quot;

For a time beginning in 2003, Bruce Fein, a noted constitutional scholar and former associate deputy attorney general under Ronald Reagan, represented Radack &quot;pro bono&quot;. Rick Robinson of Fulbright &amp; Jaworski and Mona Lyons also represented her.

===Congressional questions===
At a May 7, 2003, hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Ted Kennedy questioned Michael Chertoff, who was before the committee as a nominee for a circuit court judgeship, and who, as an Assistant Attorney General during the period in which Lindh was prosecuted, headed the Justice Department&#x27;s Criminal Division. Kennedy later said that Chertoff&#x27;s initial answers about Radack&#x27;s case were &quot;nonresponsive, evasive and hyper-technical&quot; but that after follow-up questions, Chertoff provided more &quot;direct and forthcoming&quot; answers.

On May 22, Kennedy issued a statement saying, &quot;Mr. Chertoff has told me that [he] has no knowledge of the facts surrounding Ms. Radack&#x27;s employment, performance, or departure from the Department, and I take him at his word. Nevertheless, I remain very concerned about Ms. Radack&#x27;s situation. According to press reports—and the Department has never issued any statement disputing them—Ms. Radack was in effect fired for providing legal advice on a matter involving ethical duties and civil liberties that higher-level officials at the Department disagreed with.&quot;

On May 23, by a vote of 13 to 0, the committee sent Chertoff&#x27;s judicial nomination to the full Senate for confirmation. Six Democrats, however, voted &quot;present&quot;, saying they wanted more time to review Radack&#x27;s accusations.

==Whistleblower defense lawyer, after DOJ==

<doc id="521983" wikidata="Q1035213" url="?curid=521983" title="Capture the flag">
<text>Capture the Flag (CTF) is a traditional outdoor sport where two or more teams each have a flag (or other markers) and the objective is to capture the other team&#x27;s flag, located at the team&#x27;s &quot;base&quot; (or hidden or even buried somewhere in the territory), and bring it safely back to their own base. Enemy players can be &quot;tagged&quot; by players when out of their home territory and, depending on the rules, they may be out of the game, become members of the opposite team, be sent back to their own territory, be frozen in place, or be sent to &quot;jail&quot; until freed by a member of their own team.

==Overview==
Capture the Flag requires a playing field. In both indoor and outdoor versions, the field is divided into two clearly designated halves, known as territories. Players form two teams, one for each territory. Each side has a &quot;flag&quot;, which is most often a piece of fabric, but can be any object small enough to be easily carried by a person (night time games might use flashlights, glowsticks or lanterns as the &quot;flags&quot;). Sometimes teams wear dark colors at night to make it more difficult for their opponents to see them.

The objective of the game is for players to venture into the opposing team&#x27;s territory, grab the flag, and return with it to their territory without being tagged. The flag is defended mainly by tagging opposing players who attempt to take it. Within their territory players are &quot;safe&quot;, meaning that they cannot be tagged by opposing players. Once they cross into the opposing team&#x27;s territory they are vulnerable to tagging.

Rules for Capture the Flag appear in 1860 in the German gymnastic manual &quot;Lehr- und Handbuch der deutschen Turnkunst&quot; by Wilhelm Lübeck under the name &quot;Fahnenbarlauf&quot;. In the 19th century, Capture the Flag was not considered a distinct game, but a variation of the European game &quot;Barlaufen&quot; (&quot;Barlauf mit Fahnenraub&quot;), played in France and Germany.

Descriptions of Capture the Flag in English appeared in the early 20th century, e. g. in &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; written in 1908 by Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouting Movement, under the title &quot;Flag Raiding&quot;. They also appeared in the 1920 Edition of &quot;The Official Handbook for Boys&quot; published by the Boy Scouts of America.

The flag is usually placed in a visibly obvious location at the rear of a team&#x27;s territory. In a more difficult version, the flag is hidden in a place where it can only be seen from certain angles. Capturing the flag also might require completing some challenge. For example, the flag could be hidden in the leaves up in a tall tree, and the players have to see the flag, then knock it out and bring it to their base.

===Jail===
The rules for jail vary from game to game and deal with what happens if a player is tagged in the other team&#x27;s territory. Either each team can decide a designated area for the other team&#x27;s players to go to when tagged, or a single jail can be used for both teams. When tagged, a player should be trusted to go to jail on their own, or should need to be escorted, depending on the game. Players can leave the jail after a certain time, for example three minutes, or can leave early if tagged by a teammate. Depending on the game, players can be released on the way to jail, or may have to be in jail before being released.

===Capturing the flag===

The rules for the handling of the flag also vary from game to game and deal mostly with the disposition of the flag after a failed attempt at capturing it. In one variant, after a player is tagged while carrying the flag, it is returned to its original place. In another variant, the flag is left in the location where the player was tagged. This latter variant makes offensive play easier, as the flag will tend, over the course of the game, to be moved closer to the dividing line between territories. In some games, it is possible for the players to throw the flag to teammates. As long as the flag stays in play without hitting the ground, the players are allowed to pass it.

When the flag is captured by one player, they&#x27;re not safe from being tagged, unless they trip. Sometimes, the flag holder may not be safe at all, even in their home territory, until they obtain both flags, thus ending the game. Their goal is to return to their own side or hand it off to a teammate who will then carry it to the other side. In most versions the flag may be handed off while running. The game is won when a player returns to their own territory with the enemy flag or both teams&#x27; flags. Also, rarely the flag carrier may not attempt to free any of their teammates from jail.

===Variants===
Alterations may include &quot;one flag&quot; Capture the Flag in which there is a defensive team and an offensive team, or games with three or more flags. In the case of the latter, one can only win when all flags are captured.

Another variation is when the players put bandannas in their pockets with about six inches sticking out. Instead of tagging opponents, players must pull their opponent&#x27;s bandanna out of their pocket. No matter where a player is when their bandanna is pulled, they&#x27;re captured and must either go to jail or return to their base before returning to play. In this version there is no team territory, only a small base where the team&#x27;s flag is kept. To win, one team must have both of the flags in their base.

In some urban settings, the game is played indoors in an enclosed area with walls. There is also an area in the opposing ends for the flag to be placed in. In this urban variation legal checking as in hockey, including against the sideboards, is allowed. A player who commits a foul or illegal check is placed in a penalty box for a specified amount of time, depending on the severity of the foul. A player who deliberately injures an opponent is expelled from the rest of the game. Throwing the flag is allowed in this variation, as long as the flag is caught before it hits the ground. If the flag is thrown to a teammate but hits the ground before it can be caught, the flag is placed from the spot of the throw. If a player throws the flag, but is blocked or intercepted by a player from the opposing team, the flag is placed back at the base.

It is not uncommon for people to play airsoft, paintball, or Nerf variations of Capture the Flag. Typically there are no territories in these versions. Players who are &quot;hit&quot; must sit out a predetermined amount of time before returning to play (respawning).

====Stealing sticks====
&quot;Stealing sticks&quot; is a similar game played in the British Isles, the United States, and Australia. However, instead of a flag, a number of sticks or other items such as coats or hats are placed in a &quot;goal&quot; on the far end of each side of the playing field or area. As in Capture the Flag, players are sent to a &quot;prison&quot; if tagged on the opponents&#x27; side, and may be freed by teammates. Each player may only take one of their opponents&#x27; sticks at a time. The first team to take all of the opponents&#x27; sticks to their own side wins.

==Software and games==

In 1984, Scholastic published &quot;Bannercatch&quot; for the Apple II and Commodore 64 computers. An educational video game with recognizable capture-the-flag mechanics, &quot;Bannercatch&quot; allows up to two humans (each alternating between two characters in the game world) to play capture the flag against an increasingly difficult team of four AI bots. &quot;Bannercatch&quot;″s game world is divided into quadrants: home, enemy, and two &quot;no-mans land&quot; areas which hold the jails. A successful capture requires bringing the enemy flag into one team&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; quadrant. Players can be captured when in an enemy territory, or in &quot;no-mans land&quot; while holding a flag. Captured players must be &quot;rescued&quot; from their designated jail by one of the other members of the team. Fallen flags remain where they dropped until a time-out period elapses, after which the flag returns to one of several starting locations in home territory. The 2D map also features walls, trees and a moving river, enabling a wide variety of strategies. Special locations in the play area allow humans to query the game state (such as flag status) using binary messages.

In 1992, Richard Carr released an MS-DOS based game called &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;. It is a turn-based strategy game with real time network / modem play (or play-by-mail) based around the traditional outdoor game. The game required players to merely move one of their characters onto the same square as their opponent&#x27;s flag, as opposed to bringing it back to friendly territory, because of difficulties implementing the artificial intelligence that the computer player would have needed to bring the enemy flag home and intercept opposing characters carrying the flag. 

===Computer security===


In computer security Capture the Flag (CTF), &quot;flags&quot; are secrets hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. Competitors steal flags either from other competitors (attack/defense-style CTFs) or from the organizers (jeopardy-style challenges). Several variations exist, including hiding flags in hardware devices.

==Urban gaming==
Capture the Flag is among the games that made a comeback among adults in the early 21st century as part of the urban gaming trend (which includes games like Pac-Manhattan, Fugitive, Unreal Tournament and Manhunt). The game is played on city streets and players use cellphones to communicate. News about the games spreads virally through the use of blogs and mailing lists. Urban Capture the Flag has been played in cities throughout North America. One long-running example occurs on the Northrop Mall at the University of Minnesota on Fridays with typical attendance ranging from 50 to several hundred.

<text>Emily Margaret Watson (born 14 January 1967) is an English actress. She began her career on stage and joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1992. In 2002, she starred in productions of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; and &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse, and was nominated for the Olivier Award for Best Actress for the latter. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her debut film role as a newlywed in Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) and for her portrayal of Jacqueline du Pré in Anand Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; (1998).

Watson&#x27;s other films include &quot;The Boxer&quot; (1997), &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002), &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (2002), &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot; (2004), &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005), &quot;Miss Potter&quot; (2006), &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; (2008), &quot;Oranges and Sunshine&quot; (2010), &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011), &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot; (2014), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;God&#x27;s Creatures&quot; (2022), and &quot;Small Things like These&quot; (2024). 

For her role in the HBO miniseries &quot;Chernobyl&quot;, she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. She won the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress for playing Janet Leach in the 2011 ITV television biopic &quot;Appropriate Adult&quot; and was nominated for the International Emmy Award for Best Actress for the 2017 BBC miniseries &quot;Apple Tree Yard&quot;. In 2024, she portrayed the lead role of Valya Harkonnen the HBO science fiction series &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Watson was born 14 January 1967 in London. Her father, Richard Watson, was an architect, and her mother, Katharine (&quot;née&quot; Venables), was an English teacher at St David&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School, West London. She has an older sister, Harriet. Watson was brought up as an Anglican. She has described her childhood-self as &#x27;a nice middle-class English girl ... I&#x27;d love to say I was a rebellious teenager, but I wasn&#x27;t.&#x27; She is a childhood friend of actress and writer Clara Salaman, and starred in the screen adaptation of Salaman&#x27;s novel &quot;Too Close&quot;.

Watson was educated at St James Independent Schools in west London which were founded by the School of Economic Science. Whilst there, she witnessed &quot;incidents of extreme cruelty&quot; that were &quot;very scarring for people going forward in their lives&quot;. She attended the University of Bristol, where she obtained a BA (1988, English). Watson subsequently trained at Drama Studio London. In 2003 she received an honorary MA from Bristol University. Watson was a member of the School of Economic Science until 1996, when aged 29 she was expelled following her part in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot;. She describes the organisation as a &quot;very repressive regime&quot; and a &quot;system where you were supposed to think a certain way and you weren&#x27;t really allowed to think any other way&quot;. Breaking out of it, she says, was a &quot;very powerful release&quot; in her life.

==Career==
Watson&#x27;s career began on the stage. Her theatre credits include &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (at the Royal National Theatre), &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and &quot;The Lady from the Sea&quot;. Watson has also worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company in &quot;A Jovial Crew&quot;, &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot; and &quot;The Changeling&quot;.

Watson was virtually unknown until director Lars von Trier chose her to star in &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; (1996) after Helena Bonham Carter dropped out. Watson&#x27;s performance as Bess McNeill won her the Los Angeles, London and New York Critics&#x27; Circle Awards for Best Actress, as well as the US National Society of Film Critics&#x27; Award for Best Actress and nominations at the Academy Awards, the British Academy Film Awards, and the Golden Globe Awards.
Watson came to public notice again in another controversial role, that of cellist Jacqueline du Pré in &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;, for which she learned to play the cello in three months, and received another Oscar nomination. She also played a leading role in &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot;, a story of a theatre show in the 1930s, directed by Tim Robbins. Though she won the title role of Frank McCourt&#x27;s mother in the adaptation of his acclaimed memoir, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, the film underperformed. In 2001, she appeared with John Turturro in &quot;The Luzhin Defence&quot; and in Robert Altman&#x27;s ensemble piece &quot;Gosford Park&quot;. 

Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet wrote the character &quot;Amélie&quot; for Watson to play (Amélie was originally named Emily) but she eventually turned the role down due to difficulties speaking French and a desire not to be away from home. The role made a star of Audrey Tautou. She was also the first choice to play Elizabeth I in Shekhar Kapur&#x27;s film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, the role that won Cate Blanchett an Academy Award nomination.

The following year, she starred as Reba McClane in the adaptation of Thomas Harris&#x27;s &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; prequel, &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, as the romantic interest of Adam Sandler in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; and in the sci-fi action thriller &quot;Equilibrium&quot; with Christian Bale. In 2002, she took time off from cinema to play two roles in Sam Mendes&#x27; repertory productions of &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, first at Mendes&#x27; Donmar Warehouse in London and later at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Her performance was widely acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic and she was nominated for an Olivier Award for &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;.

In 2004, Watson received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance as Peter Sellers&#x27;s first wife, Anne Howe, in the HBO film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. 2005 saw Watson star in four films: &quot;Wah-Wah&quot;, Richard E. Grant&#x27;s autobiographical directorial debut; &quot;Separate Lies&quot;, directed by &quot;Gosford Park&quot; writer Julian Fellowes; Tim Burton&#x27;s animated film &quot;Corpse Bride&quot;, with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter; and John Hillcoat&#x27;s Australian Western, &quot;The Proposition&quot;.

In 2006, Watson took a supporting role in &quot;Miss Potter,&quot; a biographical drama about children&#x27;s author Beatrix Potter, from &quot;Babe&quot; director Chris Noonan, with Ewan McGregor and Renée Zellweger; and also in an adaptation of Thea Beckman&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;Crusade in Jeans&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in &quot;The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep&quot;, an adaptation of the Dick King-Smith children&#x27;s novel about the origin of the Loch Ness Monster. In 2007, &quot;Mood Indigo&quot;, a script written by Watson and her husband, was optioned by Capitol Films. The film is a love story set during the Second World War and concerns a young woman who falls in love with a pilot.

In 2008, Watson starred with Julia Roberts and Carrie-Anne Moss in &quot;Fireflies in the Garden&quot;, the Lifetime Television movie &quot;The Memory Keeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (based on the novel with the same name), and in screenwriter Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;Synecdoche, New York.&quot; In 2009 she appeared in the film &quot;Cold Souls&quot;, from first-time director Sophie Barthes, and &quot;Within the Whirlwind&quot;, a biographical film of Russian poet and Gulag survivor Evgenia Ginzburg from &quot;The Luzhin Defence&quot; director Marleen Gorris. Watson considers Ginzburg her best recent role; however, the film was not picked up for distribution.

In 2010, she starred in &quot;Oranges and Sunshine&quot;, a film recounting the true story of children sent into abusive care homes in Australia, directed by Jim Loach, and also the following year (2011) in &quot;War Horse&quot;, an adaptation of Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s prizewinning novel, directed by Steven Spielberg. In 2011, she played Janet Leach in the ITV two-part film &quot;Appropriate Adult&quot;, about serial killer Fred West, for which she won a BAFTA.

In 2014, Watson had supporting roles in &quot;The Book Thief&quot;, alongside Geoffrey Rush and Sophie Nélisse, and the Oscar-nominated film &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;, portraying Jane Wilde, Hawking&#x27;s mother in law, alongside Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. In 2015, she had supporting roles in &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;, alongside Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington, Eduardo Verástegui&#x27;s &quot;Little Boy&quot; and &quot;A Royal Night Out&quot;, in which she portrayed Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. She also received rave reviews for her portrayal of Julie Nicholson in the BBC Drama &quot;A Song for Jenny&quot;, with experts tipping her to win the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress.

In 2019 she appeared as a nuclear scientist — a composite of several real scientists — in the miniseries &quot;Chernobyl&quot;.

Watson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to drama. In 2017, she starred in the BBC mini-series &quot;Apple Tree Yard&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Watson married Jack Waters, whom she had met at the Royal Shakespeare Company, in 1995. Waters is a former actor who now works as a potter. They have a daughter born in 2005, and a son in 2009. They live in Greenwich, London.

Watson is a supporter of the children&#x27;s charity the NSPCC. In 2004, she was inducted into the society&#x27;s hall of fame for spearheading the successful campaign to appoint a Children&#x27;s Commissioner for England. Receiving her award in the crowded House of Commons, she spoke out against the possibility that the Children&#x27;s Commissioner become a figurehead with little real power. She is also one of the patrons of the London children&#x27;s charity Scene &amp; Heard. In April 2018, Watson presented Maternity Worldwide as her chosen charity on the BBC Radio 4 Appeal.

<text>Clifford Glenwood Shull (September 23, 1915 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – March 31, 2001) was an American physicist.

==Biography==
Shull attended Schenley High School in Pittsburgh, received his BS from Carnegie Institute of Technology and PhD from New York University. He worked for The Texas Company at Beacon, New York during the wartime, followed by a position in the Clinton Laboratory (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and finally joined MIT in 1955, and retired in 1986.

He died on March 31, 2001, at the age 85.

==Research==
Clifford G. Shull was awarded the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics with Canadian Bertram Brockhouse. The two won the prize for the development of the neutron scattering technique. He also conducted research on condensed matter. Professor Shull&#x27;s prize was awarded for his pioneering work in neutron scattering, a technique that reveals where atoms are within a material like ricocheting bullets reveal where obstacles are in the dark.

When a beam of neutrons is directed at a given material, the neutrons bounce off, or are scattered by, atoms in the sample being investigated. The neutrons&#x27; directions change, depending on the location of the atoms they hit, and a diffraction pattern of the atoms&#x27; positions can then be obtained. Understanding where atoms are in a material and how they interact with one another is the key to understanding a material&#x27;s properties.

&quot;Then we can think of how we can make better window glass, better semiconductors, better microphones. All of these things go back to understanding the basic science behind their operation,&quot; Professor Shull, then 79, said on the day of the Nobel announcement. ...

He started [his pioneering work] in 1946 at what is now Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At that time, he said, &quot;Scientists at Oak Ridge were very anxious to find real honest-to-goodness scientific uses for the information and technology that had been developed during the war at Oak Ridge and at other places associated with the wartime Manhattan Project.&quot;

Professor Shull teamed up with Ernest Wollan, and for the next nine years they explored ways of using the neutrons produced by nuclear reactors to probe the atomic structure of materials.

In Professor Shull&#x27;s opinion the most important problem he worked on at the time dealt with determining the positions of hydrogen atoms in materials.

&quot;Hydrogen atoms are ubiquitous in all biological materials and in many other inorganic materials,&quot; he once said, &quot;but you couldn&#x27;t see them with other techniques. With neutrons it turned out that that was completely different, and we were very pleased and happy to find that we could learn things about hydrogen-containing structures.&quot;

As he refined the scattering technique, Professor Shull studied the fundamental properties of the neutron itself. He also initiated the first neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic materials. ... &quot;If there is a ... &#x27;Father of Neutron Scattering&#x27; in the United States, it is Professor Shull,&quot; wrote Anthony Nunes ..., professor of physics at the University of Rhode Island. ...

Professor Shull came to MIT as a full professor in 1955 and retired in 1986, though he continued to visit and to &quot;look over the shoulders&quot; of students doing experiments in the &quot;remnants of my old research laboratory.&quot;

Professor Shull&#x27;s awards include the Buckley Prize, which he received from the American Physical Society in 1956, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1956) and to the National Academy of Sciences (1975). In 1993 he received the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences&#x27; Gregori Aminoff prize for his &quot;development and application of neutron diffraction methods for studies of atomic and magnetic structures of solids.&quot;&#x27; [1]

<text>Justin David Hawkins (born 17 March 1975) is an English musician, Internet personality, singer, and songwriter best known as the founder, lead singer, and lead guitarist of The Darkness, of which his younger brother Dan is also a member. He is also the lead singer and guitarist for the band Hot Leg, formed in 2008 and now on hiatus. In 2021, Hawkins launched a YouTube channel entitled &quot;Justin Hawkins Rides Again&quot;, where he does comedic analysis on songs or artists in addition to covering news in the musical community.

==Early life==
Hawkins was born on 17 March 1975 in Chertsey, Surrey to Sandra and Harold Hawkins. His brother Dan Hawkins was born on 12 December 1976. The brothers grew up in Lowestoft, Suffolk; Hawkins recalled that he and Dan shared a friendly sibling rivalry which prompted both brothers to learn to play the guitar at a young age. Hawkins and his brother both attended East Point Academy. He later found interest as a vocalist, citing Freddie Mercury and Bon Scott as his two biggest influences.

==Music career==
Hawkins enrolled at Huddersfield Technical College in 1997 to study Music Technology. He later managed a position writing advertisement jingles for Ikea and Yahoo! through the late 1990s and early 2000s. Hawkins&#x27; brother Dan recalled that Justin had developed a flamboyant stage image as he often performed with numerous local bands wearing spandex or sparkled outfits while utilizing his distinct vocal range to captivate audiences. Hawkins later claimed he used his earnings from a popular commercial he wrote and sang for Ikea in 2000 to fund the Darkness&#x27; debut album. Hawkins has been praised for his musical abilities, particularly his voice which spans five octaves.

===The Darkness===
Hawkins and his brother Dan had performed together in numerous bands whilst they were both attending university; though Justin recalls his brother was the original singer of a progressive rock project the two took part in. Eventually the two met drummer Ed Graham and sought to create a new project., the two began playing clubs and pubs before they were later signed by record label Atlantic Records. Their debut album, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;, went straight to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK. 3.5m copies over all. The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They went on to headline the Carling Festival in 2004. The band won three BRIT Awards in 2004 in response to the album, &quot;Best Group&quot;, &quot;Best Rock Group&quot; and &quot;Best Album&quot;. They also won two Kerrang! awards in 2004 for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; and &quot;Best British Band&quot;. The third single from the album, &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot;, was a substantial hit in the UK, as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, &quot;Christmas Time (Don&#x27;t Let the Bells End)&quot;, which only just fell short, both singles reaching No. 2 in 2003. The band also appeared in the video for Band Aid 20, with Hawkins singing a number of lines.
By late 2004 the band&#x27;s constant media coverage had started to lead to a general public backlash, and Hawkins and the band themselves seemed to show signs that they were disillusioned with their constant media appearances, infamously walking off of an episode of the U.S.-nationally syndicated radio talk show &quot;Loveline&quot; on 19 April 2004.

In October 2005, a month before the album &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back&quot; was to be officially released, Hawkins won an eBay auction for a copy of &quot;One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back&quot; for £350 under the username &#x27;turbogunhawk&#x27;. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again.

&quot;One Way Ticket&quot;, the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles chart. The album itself was released on 28 November 2005, to somewhat mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer Roy Thomas Baker, best known for his work with Queen. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well its predecessor, &quot;Permission to Land&quot;. The album debuted at no. 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it went on to achieve platinum status, this was in stark contrast with their debut&#x27;s five times platinum status.
The second single taken from their second album was &quot;Is It Just Me?&quot;, released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No. 6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. Hawkins announced when on stage that their third single to be released from the album was &quot;Girlfriend&quot;. Released 22 May, &quot;Girlfriend&quot; charted at number 39.

The band followed up their second album with a tour of the UK and Ireland, consisting of 12 dates in the major cities. The tour opened in Dublin&#x27;s Point Depot on 4 February and closed in the Nottingham Arena on 20 February. Few of the venues sold out, their appeal seemingly having become more selective. Their world tour, which followed, arrived in Australia and Japan after touring Scandinavia and Continental Europe in March.

In October 2006, Hawkins left the Darkness. Although drug and alcohol problems were initially cited as the main reason, later on national television, Hawkins would claim that he had grown tired of the constant routine of the band, recording and promoting an album, going on tours for months, back in the studio, etc. which he considered &quot;monotonous and boring&quot; and &quot;could not understand how bands like the Rolling Stones could sustain it&quot;. For his time with the Darkness, Hawkins placed at number 35 on &quot;Spin&quot; list of the greatest frontmen of all time.

In 2011 the band reunited and toured Europe, Asia and North America throughout 2011 and 2012 in support of their new album &quot;Hot Cakes&quot;. They then released &quot;Last Of Our Kind&quot; in 2015.

The band returned in 2017 with &quot;Pinewood Smile,&quot; their first album to come through Cooking Vinyl. Ahead of the album&#x27;s announcement, The Darkness toured Europe in support of Guns N&#x27; Roses and played a number of festivals in the UK and Europe during the summer. In 2018, they released their &quot;Live At Hammersmith&quot; album.

2019 saw the Darkness release the album &quot;Easter Is Cancelled&quot; on 4 October; the album charted in the top 10 in the UK.

In January 2020, The Darkness released a new video for &quot;In Another Life&quot;, which featured model Abbey Clancy. The track then made the BBC Radio 2 B-List.

===Other projects===
In 2005, Hawkins set up a solo project, called British Whale. His debut single, &quot;This Town Ain&#x27;t Big Enough for Both of Us&quot;, a cover of the 1974 hit by Sparks, was released on 15 August, reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart. The music video depicts Hawkins competing in a game show against World Darts Champion Phil Taylor, and features Sparks&#x27;s Ron and Russell Mael as the show&#x27;s hosts.

In 2006 Hawkins released a second single, available only to download, an unofficial World Cup anthem called &quot;England&quot;.

Hawkins sang backing vocals on the Sweet&#x27;s song &quot;Hell Raiser&quot; for Def Leppard&#x27;s 2006 covers album &quot;Yeah!&quot;

In early 2007, he became half of one of six acts competing to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest competition in Helsinki in a duet with singer Beverlei Brown. He entered &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; with Beverlei Brown singing a song entitled &quot;They Don’t Make &#x27;Em Like They Used To&quot; but did not win the competition.

On 16 March 2007, he appeared on the Comic Relief evening during the half-hour Top Gear of the Pops programme. This saw him performing Billy Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Red Light Spells Danger&quot; with the three Top Gear presenters.

Later that month, on 29 March, Hawkins created a new Myspace profile featuring songs that were planned to be included on his upcoming solo album entitled &quot;Panther&quot;. The songs are titled &quot;You Can&#x27;t Hurt Me Anymore&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Met Jesus&quot; and &quot;Whichever&quot;. On 12 May, Hawkins added a further song to his profile, &quot;Gay in the 80&#x27;s&quot;. The songs appeared on the Hot Leg album &quot;Red Light Fever&quot;.
There is a wax model of Hawkins at Madame Tussaud&#x27;s in London.

Hawkins supplied the singing and guitar playing for Kurtz, the lead singer of the &quot;bad guy band&quot; Mantyz in the BBC&#x27;s animated series &quot;Freefonix&quot;, which debuted on 4 January 2008.

In the film &quot;Telstar&quot; about Joe Meek&#x27;s life and career, released on 19 June 2009, Hawkins played the role of Screaming Lord Sutch.

With Hot Leg in November 2008, he toured the UK supporting Alter Bridge (4–13 November) and Extreme (14–24 November).

Hawkins has also worked with British pop-rock band Saving Aimee, producing their debut album. He also lent his &quot;truth larynx&quot; to the track &quot;Party All Day (Fuck All Night)&quot; guesting on the 2009 Steel Panther release, &quot;Feel the Steel&quot;. Hawkins recently worked with Adam Lambert on the track &quot;Music Again&quot; off his debut album.

Justin played the role of Josh, a burned out rockstar in the 2010 movie &quot;Psychosis&quot;. The movie also featured three Hot Leg songs.

Hawkins also appeared on the Meat Loaf album &quot;Hang Cool Teddy Bear&quot;, where he co-wrote two songs (&quot;Love Is Not Real&quot; and &quot;California Isn&#x27;t Big Enough&quot;). He also provided guitar on &quot;California Isn&#x27;t Big Enough&quot; and backing vocals on &quot;Love Is Not Real&quot; and &quot;Los Angeloser&quot;.

In 2012, Hawkins appeared in a Samsung commercial for their Galaxy Note smartphone during Super Bowl XLVI. In the same year, Hawkins and brother Dan appeared in the ZingZillas episode Electric Guitar.

In 2016, Hawkins appeared on the De La Soul album &quot;and the Anonymous Nobody...&quot; providing vocals on the track &quot;Lord Intended&quot;.

In 2020, Hawkins participated in the UK version of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, appearing as Chameleon. His identity was revealed in the third episode when he was voted out. During his time on the show he performed renditions of &quot;Creep&quot; by Radiohead, &quot;Feel It Still&quot; by Portugal. The Man, and &quot;True Colors&quot; by Cyndi Lauper.

On 3 September 2022, Hawkins participated in the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert, where he joined John Lousteau and the Coattail Riders to perform &quot;Louise&quot;, &quot;Range Rover Bitch&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;. He then joined Wolfgang Van Halen, Dave Grohl and Josh Freese to perform &quot;Panama&quot; and &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; by Van Halen. He also made an appearance with Brian Johnson to perform &quot;Back in Black&quot;. Later, he performed “Under Pressure” with Queen.

==YouTube career==
In 2021, Hawkins launched his YouTube channel, &quot;Justin Hawkins Rides Again&quot;, where he reviews music, commentates on the music industry and answers fan questions. As of August 2024, Hawkins’ channel has surpassed 500,000 subscribers. Hawkins has received praise from viewers for his comedic delivery and remarkable guitar abilities as he frequently dissects song structures; his videos have amassed nearly 90 million views cumulatively. Hawkins has reviewed numerous songs and artists such as Greta Van Fleet, Maroon 5, My Chemical Romance, Disturbed, Metallica, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Slipknot among others.

== Personal life ==
Hawkins states that he is vegan.

Hawkins is a football fan, having supported Manchester United growing up, but he is now primarily a supporter of Norwich City.

==Equipment==

Hawkins is seen playing Gibson Les Paul Customs almost exclusively. He is most commonly seen playing an alpine white model which he used with the Darkness (as seen in the &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Love Is Only a Feeling&quot; music videos), and with Hot Leg. It is rare to see him use another guitar, although he can be seen playing a custom Ibanez Jem for the song &quot;Bald&quot;. He has also been seen using an ebony Gibson Les Paul Custom, a one-off Gibson &quot;Less Paul&quot; custom sculpted to resemble a shell, and a custom finished blue Les Paul standard airbrushed with the mythical dog Black Shuck and Blythburgh church. In 2004 Gibson issued a limited run of Justin Hawkins signature Les Paul Customs based on the &#x27;68 RI with abalone and mother of pearl &quot;flame&quot; inlays on the fretboard, a sparkle finish in either Silverburst or Pinkburst (a Blueburst and Redburst have also been pictured, as well as a one-off Gold Mirror finish produced by SimS Custom Guitars). These have become highly valuable because of their scarcity and unique features.

Hawkins used Mesa/Boogie Dual and Triple Rectifier amplifiers rather than Marshalls when performing with the Darkness. The stacks he was using had custom-made speaker cabs coated in red leather. During his time in Hot Leg he was exclusively seen using Cornford MK50H II&#x27;s in white vinyl with two Cornford, 16-ohm, 4x12 cabinets loaded with Celestion &quot;Vintage 30s&quot;. Since the Darkness reformation he has been seen using multiple modified Marshall 1959 MKII Plexi Reissue guitar amps with a boosted gain stage run through Marshall 1960B cabinets. Between 2016 and 2021, Hawkins used EVH and Wizard amplifiers. From December 2021, Hawkins has used Laney JH3000 heads and GS 4x12 cabinets.

In a 2012 edition of &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine&#x27;s video series &quot;On the Road with...&quot; Hawkins&#x27;s pedal setup consisted of a Boss Analog Delay, a Pro Co RAT, a Diamond Pedals Compressor, a Boss TU-3 Tuner, and a Dunlop Cry Baby DCR-2SR rack module which allows him to have three separate wah-wah pedals strategically placed around the stage. As of 2016, Hawkins does not use any pedals.

<doc id="522007" wikidata="Q7730169" url="?curid=522007" title="The Digger Papers">
<text>The Digger Papers was a free collective publication of the Diggers, one of the 1960s improvisational theatre groups in San Francisco&#x27;s Haight-Ashbury district. The magazine was first published in Fall 1965. Peter Berg was one of the regular contributors to the publication. 

One of the first Digger activities was the publishing of various broadsides, which were printed by sneaking into the local Students for a Democratic Society office and using their Gestetner printer. The leaflets were eventually called &quot;The Digger Papers&quot;, and soon morphed into small pamphlets with poetry, psychedelic art, and essays. They often included statements that mocked the prevailing attitude of the counterculture promoted by less radical figures like the Haight-Independent Proprietors (HIP), Timothy Leary, and Richard Alpert. The first paper mocked the acid community, saying, &quot;Time to forget because flowers are beautiful and the sun&#x27;s not yellow, it&#x27;s chicken!&quot; &quot;The Digger Papers&quot; originated such phrases as &quot;Do your own thing&quot; and &quot;Today is the first day of the rest of your life.&quot; Articles rarely included authors&#x27; names, though some had pseudonyms like &quot;George Metevsky,&quot; a reference to the &quot;Mad Bomber&quot; George Metesky.

In the early part of 1967, writers Chester Anderson and Claude &amp; Helene Hayward helped form the Communications Company (ComCo), the publishing arm of the Diggers. Using two &quot;Gestetner mimeograph machines that had been nefariously obtained through the offices of &quot;Ramparts&quot; magazine,&quot; ComCo took over publication of &quot;The Digger Papers&quot;.

The last issue of &quot;The Digger Papers&quot;, published in August 1968, featured a reprint of Richard Brautigan&#x27;s poem, &quot;All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace.&quot;

<text>Dame Kristin Ann Scott Thomas (born 24 May 1960) is a British actress. A five-time BAFTA Award and Olivier Award nominee, she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994) and the Olivier Award for Best Actress in 2008 for the Royal Court revival of &quot;The Seagull&quot;. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1996).

Scott Thomas made her film debut in &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; (1986), and won the Evening Standard Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer for &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1988). Her work includes &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; (1992), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; (1998), &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), &quot;The Valet&quot; (2006), and &quot;Tell No One&quot; (2007). She won the European Film Award for Best Actress for Philippe Claudel&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Loved You So Long&quot; (2008). Her other films include &quot;Leaving&quot; (2009), &quot;Love Crime&quot; (2010), &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Key&quot; (2010), &quot;Nowhere Boy&quot; (2010), &quot;The Woman in the Fifth&quot; (2011), &quot;Only God Forgives&quot; (2013), &quot;Darkest Hour&quot; (2017), and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2018).

She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2003 Birthday Honours and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to drama. She was named a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French government in 2005.

==Early life==
Scott Thomas was born in Redruth, Cornwall. Her mother, Deborah (née Hurlbatt), was brought up in Hong Kong and Africa, and studied drama before marrying Kristin&#x27;s father, Lieutenant Commander Simon Scott Thomas, a pilot in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm, who died in a flying accident when Kristin was aged five. She has three siblings, including Serena Scott Thomas. She is the niece of Admiral Sir Richard Thomas (a former Black Rod), the granddaughter of William Scott Thomas (who commanded during World War II) and the great-great-niece of the polar explorer Captain Robert Falcon Scott.

The childhood home of Scott Thomas was in Trent, near Sherborne, Dorset, England. Her mother remarried another Royal Navy pilot, Lieutenant Commander Simon Idiens (of Simon&#x27;s Sircus aerobatic team flying Sea Vixens), who also died in a flying accident whilst flying a Phantom FG1 from RNAS Yeovilton off the North coast of Cornwall in January 1972. Scott Thomas was educated at Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College and St Antony&#x27;s Leweston in Sherborne, Dorset.

On leaving school in 1978, she moved to Hampstead, London, and worked in a department store. She began training to become a drama teacher at the Central School of Speech and Drama, enrolling on a BEd in Speech and Drama. During her time at the school, she requested to switch degree courses to acting but was refused. After a year at Central, speaking French fluently, she decided to move to Paris to work as an au pair, and studied acting at the &quot;École Nationale supérieure des arts et techniques du théâtre&quot; (ENSATT). When she was 25, she was cast as Mary Sharon in the film &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; (1986).

==Career==

Kristin Scott Thomas&#x27;s acting career garnered early attention when she was cast as Mary Sharon in &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;, released in 1986, the first but widely panned film directed by and starring the already well-known musical artist, Prince. Her breakthrough role was playing Brenda Last in an adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;A Handful of Dust&quot; (1988), winning her the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Award for the most promising newcomer. This was followed by roles opposite Hugh Grant in &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; and &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; where she won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.

In 1994, she starred in the Romanian–French film &quot;An Unforgettable Summer&quot;, in which she played Marie-Thérèse Von Debretsy. Rather than learn Romanian for the part, she read her lines phonetically. She had all the lines translated into French, which she speaks fluently, so she knew what she was saying. In an interview for &quot;Gloucester Citizen&quot; on 22 March 2015, she cited &quot;An Unforgettable Summer&quot; as one of the films that she is most proud of alongside &quot;The English Patient&quot; and &quot;Only God Forgives&quot;.

In the 1996 film &quot;The English Patient&quot;, her role as Katharine Clifton gained her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations as well as critical acclaim. This was followed by a brief period working in Hollywood on films such as &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; with Robert Redford and &quot;Random Hearts&quot; with Harrison Ford. However, growing disillusioned with Hollywood, she took a year off to give birth to her third child.

She returned to the stage in 2003 when she played the title role in a French theatre production of Racine&#x27;s &quot;Bérénice&quot;, and appeared on-screen as Lady Sylvia McCordle in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;Gosford Park&quot;. This started a critically acclaimed second career on stage, in which she has received four nominations for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress, including one win, for her performance of Arkadina in a London West End production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. She reprised the role in New York in September 2008. In summer 2014, Scott Thomas returned to London&#x27;s West End to star as Emma in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; at the Comedy Theatre. The revival was directed by Ian Rickson. Her husband was played by Ben Miles and the love triangle was completed by Douglas Henshall. In January 2013, she starred in another Pinter play, &quot;Old Times&quot;, again directed by Ian Rickson. In 2014, she appeared at The Old Vic in the title role of Sophocles&#x27;s &quot;Electra&quot;.

Scott Thomas has also acted in French films. In 2006, she played the role of Hélène, in French, in &quot;Ne le dis à personne&quot; (&quot;Tell No One&quot;), by French director Guillaume Canet. In 2008, Scott Thomas received many accolades for her performance in &quot;Il y a longtemps que je t&#x27;aime&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve Loved You So Long&quot;), including BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. In 2009 she played the role of a wife who leaves her husband for another man in &quot;Leaving&quot;.

In &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Key&quot; (2010) – the story of the Vel&#x27; d&#x27;Hiv Roundup – Scott Thomas starred as an American journalist in Paris who discovers that the flat her husband is renovating for them was once the home of an evicted Jewish family. Other roles include Elizabeth Boleyn, Countess of Wiltshire and Ormond, mother of Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife Anne, in &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot; (2008), the role of a fashion magazine creator and editor in the film &quot;Confessions of a Shopaholic&quot; (2009), and as a love interest of George Duroy (played by Robert Pattinson) in the 2012 film &quot;Bel Ami&quot;, based on the 1885 Maupassant novel.

She was also seen in &quot;The Woman in the Fifth&quot; (2011), a film adaption of Douglas Kennedy&#x27;s novel of the same name, Lasse Hallström&#x27;s &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot; (2011), Ralph Fiennes&#x27;s &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (2013), Philippe Claudel&#x27;s &quot;Before the Winter Chill&quot; (2013), and in Nicolas Winding Refn&#x27;s &quot;Only God Forgives&quot;, which premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. In 2014, she voiced the narration of Kay Summersby, General Eisenhower&#x27;s driver, in the documentary series &quot;D-Day Sacrifice&quot;. She appeared in Israel Horovitz&#x27;s &quot;My Old Lady&quot; (2014) and &quot;Suite Française&quot;, the 2015 film adaptation of Irène Némirovsky&#x27;s World War II novel directed by Saul Dibb.

In 2017 she was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role at the 71st British Academy Film Awards for portraying Clementine Churchill in Joe Wright&#x27;s &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;. In May 2017, it was reported that Scott Thomas had signed on to star as BMW heiress Susanne Klatten in the thriller &quot;Paramour&quot;, directed by Alexandra-Therese Keining.

In 2020, Scott Thomas played Mrs. Danvers in director Ben Wheatley&#x27;s adaptation of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s Gothic romance &quot;Rebecca&quot;, with Armie Hammer and Lily James. Also that year, she appeared in the BBC television remake of Alan Bennett&#x27;s monologue series, &quot;Talking Heads&quot;, playing the role of Celia in the episode &quot;Hand of God&quot;.

In April 2022, Scott Thomas starred in the British spy thriller series Slow Horses, based on the Slough House series of novels by Mick Herron. She appeared as Diana Taverner, Deputy Director General of MI5. Premiering on Apple TV+, the series was renewed in January 2024 for a fifth season.

In June 2022, Thomas began filming on her directorial debut, &quot;North Star&quot;, starring Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham, and Freida Pinto.

==Personal life==
Scott Thomas brought up her children in Paris and has said she sometimes considers herself more French than British. During an appearance on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; on 2 December 2022, Scott Thomas said she was living in London. 

From 1987 until 2005, she was married to French obstetrician François Olivennes, with whom she has three children.

In September 2024, Scott Thomas married John Micklethwait, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News, after a five-year romance.

==Political views==
In 2009, Scott Thomas signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse case.

<text>The Lords of the New Church were a British-American rock band. A supergroup, the line-up originally consisted of four musicians from 1970s punk bands. This line-up comprised vocalist Stiv Bators (ex-the Dead Boys), guitarist Brian James (ex-the Damned), bassist Dave Tregunna (ex-Sham 69) and drummer Nick Turner (ex-the Barracudas). Launched in 1981, the band released three studio albums prior to their dissolution in 1989. During this time, they underwent several line-up changes.

More melodic and slickly produced than most punk, their music both reached a broader audience than that of many bands in the genre and alienated hardcore punk fans. The band presented a stylized tribal identity around their appearance and their music that fans embraced: the writer Dave Thompson asserts this represented &quot;the first time since the Sex Pistols&#x27; Bromley Contingent fanbase [that] a band had succeeded in grafting its own identity onto its audience without first paying obeisance to the gods of highstreet fashion.&quot; Their stage antics became notorious early in their career, with Bators stunts on one occasion reportedly resulting in his clinical death for several minutes.

The band experienced moderate chart success, with their eponymous debut album peaking at #3 on the UK Indie Chart, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Method to Our Madness&quot; hitting #158 in the US, and the 1985 &quot;Killer Lords&quot; compilation reaching #22 on the UK Indie Chart. Charting singles included &quot;New Church&quot; (#34 UK Indie), &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; (#7 UK Indie; #27 US Mainstream Rock), &quot;Dance with Me&quot; (#85 UK Singles Chart) and a cover of Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (#22 UK Indie).

The band was re-established between 2001–2003, and again briefly in 2007, with original members James and Tregunna.

==History==

=== Formation (1980–1981) ===
Stiv Bators and Brian James first met each other in 1977 when the Dead Boys opened for the Damned on a few CBGB dates in New York and an English tour. They had remained good friends and the two had often discussed working together on a project after their respective bands had disbanded. The opportunity would come in 1980, when Bators was invited to London to join British punk band Sham 69, who had recently parted ways with their singer Jimmy Pursey. Bators had met the band in Los Angeles a few months before, and they had gotten on well together. James: &quot;That was really the ticket to get Stiv over to London, so we could work. So they&#x27;d be rehearsing for this thing and getting it together, while me and Stiv in private would be working on stuff which was to become Lords stuff.&quot; With a change of name to the Wanderers, the short-lived band released only one album before disbanding in 1981. This finally allowed Bators and James to form their own band, having already aroused the interest of Miles Copeland, co-founder of I.R.S. Records. They experimented with different rhythm sections, rehearsing with bassists Tony James and Glen Matlock, and drummers Terry Chimes and Steve Nicol. James: &quot;Musically it sounded alright, but ... personality wise it just wasn&#x27;t kind of fitting. So it was like me and Stiv and &quot;the other two&quot; all the time.&quot; Bators then approached his Wanderers bandmate Dave Tregunna and, with Rat Scabies of the Damned on drums, they performed a one-off gig in London at Hammersmith Clarendon as The Dead Damned Sham Band. Their set consisted of Dead Boys, Damned and Sham 69 material, as well as covers. Since Scabies was already committed to the Damned, they soon recruited Nick &quot;Nicky&quot; Turner of the Barracudas as their full-time drummer. Billed as the Things, the new band played their first gig in Paris in late 1981.

While brainstorming band names, Copeland had suggested the Lords of Discipline. At the time, he was also managing Sting, who had started to venture into acting, and one of the scripts that was presented to Sting was for the film &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot;. James: &quot;So Miles said, &quot;Oh, great name for the band, boys! ... And we kind of thought, &quot;Well, not really, especially if there&#x27;s gonna be a film coming out with that name also.&quot; The band, however, liked the idea of calling themselves the Lords and they eventually settled on the Lords of the New Church.

=== The I.R.S. years (1982–1985) ===
Having signed with Copeland&#x27;s I.R.S. Records, Copeland also took on managerial duties, the Lords of the New Church released their self-produced eponymous debut album in July 1982. Musically, the album is a mix of punk, glam, garage rock and goth, described by &quot;New Noise Magazine&quot; as a &quot;seedy concoction of spidery guitars, sleazy bass lines, jungle drums and gothic keyboards.&quot; For the subsequent tour, the band enhanced their live sound with keyboardist Matt Irving, who had also played on the album. &quot;The Lords of the New Church&quot; was well-received and peaked at #3 on the UK Indie Chart. The single &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; reached #7 on the UK Indie Chart, #34 on the Canadian charts and #27 on the US Rock chart. Two other singles, &quot;New Church&quot; and &quot;Russian Roulette&quot;, reached #34 and #12 on the UK Indie Chart, respectively.

&quot;Is Nothing Sacred?&quot;, their second album released in September 1983, saw the band diversifying musically, incorporating new wave, classic rock and ska, along with synths, horns and a greater emphasis on the bass. Like their first album, &quot;Is Nothing Sacred?&quot; was produced by the band themselves, except for its first single - a cover version of &quot;Live for Today&quot; (#91 UK) - which was produced by Todd Rundgren. The success of the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Dance with Me&quot; (#85 UK), a song that according to Dave Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; came &quot;close to a hit&quot;, was hampered when the video directed by Derek Jarman was pulled from MTV&#x27;s rotation because, according to writer Colin Larkin, mistaken concerns were voiced about pedophilia. The song was later covered by Nouvelle Vague in 2006.

Their third album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Method to Our Madness&quot;, peaked at #158 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while the single &quot;M Style&quot; reached #97 on the UK Single Chart. Two further singles, &quot;Method to My Madness&quot; and &quot;When the Blood Runs Cold (Special Remix)&quot;, failed to chart. The album was produced by Chris Tsangarides, who had previously worked with hard rock acts like Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore and Tygers of Pan Tang. &quot;The Method to Our Madness&quot; was remixed for a 1985 US release. Mark Taylor replaced Irving as the band&#x27;s new touring member.

In early 1985, the Lords recorded Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and released it as a single a few months later. James: &quot;That was Miles&#x27; idea. It got nothing to do with us at all. We saw him in the office one day and he said, &quot;I got this great idea.&quot; The single gained the band some attention and radio airplay, taking it to #2 on the UK Indie Chart in May. That same month, according to Bators, the band were dropped by I.R.S. but were still supported by the label&#x27;s management side. Around the same time, two songs were recorded for a planned follow-up single that never materialized: &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, written for the band by T.V. Smith, and a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Hey Tonight&quot;. Both songs were produced by Steven Van Zandt and included on the compilation album &quot;Killer Lords&quot; in late 1985.

Tregunna had for some time been dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s management, convinced that they were being exploited by Copeland. He eventually left the band around the turn of the year to join Andy McCoy&#x27;s Cherry Bombz. Bators said in March 1986: &quot;We were supposed to do a tour of England in November and that would have held us over with enough money to survive. Two weeks before the tour started, I.R.S. stopped the release of the album [&quot;Killer Lords&quot;], which made all the promoters back out. ... Dave had no money and on Christmas Eve he was evicted from his flat. ... He had nowhere to go and we&#x27;d stopped touring, so he went with Cherry Bombz.&quot;

=== Final years and disbandment (1986–1989) ===

By early 1986, the Lords had replaced Tregunna with Grant Fleming (ex-Kidz Next Door), and augmented its lineup with a second guitarist, Alastair Symons (ex-The Dirty Strangers). Without a record deal, the band spent most of the year touring the US and Europe. They contributed two songs to I.R.S.&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2&quot;: &quot;Good to Be Bad&quot; and &quot;Mind Warp&quot;. The songs weren&#x27;t written specifically with the film in mind, according to Bators: &quot;They were actual Lords&#x27; songs. When we got approached about it, I read the script and adapted the lyrics to it.&quot; When asked in 1986 how the Lords ended up on the soundtrack, Bators said: &quot;Miles is our manager, publisher and ex-record company. So, our manager approached our publisher, who approached his record company.&quot;

In 1987, German independent label Perfect Beat released the Lords&#x27; rerecorded version of their 1983 single &quot;Dance with Me&quot;. It was the last recording to feature Symons before he left the band shortly after. Produced by Vic Maile, the &quot;Psycho Sex&quot; EP followed later in 1987, released through the French label Bondage International. &quot;Real Bad Time&quot; was released as a separate single from the EP.

Turner and Fleming both left the band at the end of 1987 to be replaced by Danny Fury and a returning Tregunna in 1988. The Lords continued to gig around England and Europe for the next year and a half. In 1988, Illegal released the live album &quot;Live at the Spit&quot;, recorded in Boston during the Lords&#x27; first American tour in 1982. Perfect Beat released two further live albums in 1988 and 1989: &quot;Scene of the Crime&quot;, recorded in Zürich in January 1985; and &quot;Second Coming&quot;, recorded during an October 1988 tour of Germany. A studio recording of The Creation&#x27;s &quot;Making Time&quot; was released as a single in 1988 by Perfect Beat.

The Lords of the New Church broke up when Bators ended the band onstage after a concert on 2 May 1989, at the London Astoria. In order to pay off a tax bill, the Lords had booked a tour in spring of 1989. When Bators was told about the forthcoming gigs, he declined to do them. &quot;Stiv said he couldn&#x27;t do those shows because apparently he&#x27;s hurt his back very badly&quot;, Tregunna said in 2003. When Bators, who by this time was living in Paris, eventually agreed to do only one show, the rest of the band decided to put an advert in the music press looking for a stand-in singer for the remaining dates. &quot;We thought &quot;If it looks like anyone could possibly do it, and it is a chance in a million, we&#x27;ll then introduce him to Stiv&quot;, James said in 2007. &quot;All these people came down, but none of them were right, so we thought &quot;Let&#x27;s not even mention this to Bators.&quot; ... And so we did this show at the Astoria in London and sure enough he came on at the end with a T-shirt with our ad on it, and started to fire us all.&quot;

Bators died after being struck by a car in Paris in 1990. James said in 2007: &quot;The only other person I&#x27;ve really been able to write with was Stiv Bators ... Me and Stiv were fantastic. I&#x27;ve never really had that with anybody else. ... it was like the riff master and the lyric master working together.&quot;

=== Reformation (2001–2007) ===

The band was re-established in 2001 when vocalist Steven &quot;Skid&quot; Marque, co-vocalist and guitarist Jez Miller, and drummer Ozzy joined original members James and Tregunna for the recording of the &quot;Believe it or Not&quot; single, released by NDN Records in 2002. The band undertook a European tour in spring the same year. Miller and Ozzy departed the band after the UK leg of the tour and was replaced by Adam Becvare on vocals and guitar and Steve Murray on drums. This configuration of the band produced the album &quot;Hang On&quot; in 2003, which was sold at gigs without any official record company release. James, Tregunna, Becvare and former Lords touring keyboard player Mark Taylor reunited in October 2007 for a one-off 25th anniversary gig at the 100 Club in London.

<doc id="522026" wikidata="Q7740189" url="?curid=522026" title="The Honourable The Irish Society">
<text>[[The Honourable]] The Irish Society is a consortium of livery companies of the City of London established during the Plantation of Ulster to colonise County Londonderry. It was created in 1609 within the City of London Corporation, and incorporated in 1613 by royal charter of James I. In its first decades the society rebuilt the city of Derry and town of Coleraine, and for centuries it owned property and fishing rights near both towns. Some of the society&#x27;s profits were used to develop the economy and infrastructure of the area, while some was returned to the London investors, and some used for charitable work.

The society remains in existence as a &quot;relatively small grant-giving charitable body&quot;, registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales for &quot;the promotion of any exclusively charitable purposes for the benefit of the community of the County of Londonderry and neighbouring areas&quot;. In 2020 it had six employees and disbursed £580,000 in grants. Much of its funding derives from its remaining property, including the walls of Derry, a tourist attraction and heritage site, and fisheries on the River Bann.

The society is based in the City of London, with a &quot;Representative&quot; resident in Coleraine. Its legal constitution is as a Court of &quot;honest and discreet citizens of London&quot; chaired by a Governor. The Governor is traditionally a former Lord Mayor of London, and the City&#x27;s Court of Common Council elects the Court of the Irish Society, whose size was reduced in 2013 from &quot;six and twenty&quot; to 15.

==History==
The Nine Years&#x27; War between Gaelic Irish chiefs and the Dublin Castle administration of the Kingdom of Ireland ended in Gaelic defeat 1603, and the Flight of the Earls in 1607 left northwest Ulster open to colonisation. In planning the plantation of Ulster, King James I set out to defend against a future attack from within or without. In his survey, he found that the town of Derry could become either a great asset of control over the River Foyle and Lough Swilly, or it could become an inviting back door if the people of the area were against him. He pressured the guilds of the City of London to fund the resettlement of the area, including the building of a new walled city, and the result was the creation of the society. The Virginia Company of London had been created similarly in 1606 to colonise North America.

The city of Derry was renamed Londonderry in recognition of the London origin of the Irish Society. County Coleraine was enlarged and renamed County Londonderry after its new county town. The rural area of the county was subdivided between the Great Twelve livery companies, while the towns and environs of Londonderry and Coleraine were retained by the Irish Society. The society was sequestrated in 1630, fined for non-performance in 1635, and suppressed in 1637; it was revived by Oliver Cromwell in 1650 and again after the Restoration by Londonderry&#x27;s 1662 royal charter. A dispute with the Bishop of Derry over fishing rights was appealed from the Irish House of Lords to the English House of Lords, in a controversial move later sanctioned by the Declaratory Act 1719. A private act of the Parliament of Ireland was also passed in 1704 to resolve the dispute.

During the 17th and 18th centuries four of the twelve livery companies sold their estates, the Irish Society requiring in each case a bond of indemnity. The leases to middlemen granted by the other companies expired at various times during the nineteenth century, after which the companies &quot;enormously increased the rental&quot;. Until the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, the society had an influence on the municipal corporations of Derry and Coleraine, with right of appointment of some officials and right of veto over some classes of decision. The society also had some disputes with the corporations over ownership and development of the property. Profits from the society&#x27;s commercial endeavours were redistributed to the livery companies until a lawsuit brought by the Skinners&#x27; Company in 1832 claiming a greater share of this revenue. The case was decided by the House of Lords in 1845, ruling that the society held its property in trust, not for the livery companies, but for &quot;public purposes&quot;. Since then, its profits have been used entirely for charitable ends. The 1854 Royal Commission on the City of London recommended that the Irish Society be abolished and its property transferred to a new charitable trust, unconnected to the London Corporation, with trustees nominated by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

While the companies&#x27; rural estates were sold to tenants under the Irish Land Acts after 1870, the Irish Society&#x27;s urban property was exempt from the acts. An 1889 House of Commons select committee report stated:

The Irish Society financed the building of Derry&#x27;s Guildhall; work started in 1887 and it was opened in July 1890, having cost £19,000. In 1923 the society sold most of its remaining property in Derry city to the Government of Northern Ireland for £500,000. By the 21st century its property portfolio was &quot;much reduced&quot;.

<text>Food Not Bombs (FNB) is a loose-knit group of independent collectives, sharing free, usually vegan and vegetarian food with others. The group believes that corporate and government priorities are skewed to allow hunger to persist in the midst of abundance. To demonstrate this, FNB serves surplus food gathered from grocery stores, bakeries and markets which would otherwise go to waste, or occasionally has already been thrown away. The group exhibits a form of franchise activism.

== Background and principles ==

Food Not Bombs is an all-volunteer global movement sharing free, usually vegan meals as a protest against war and poverty. Each chapter collects surplus food from grocery stores, bakeries, and that would otherwise go to waste and occasionally collects items from garbage dumpsters when stores are uncooperative. FNB also accepts donations from local farmers, then prepares free community meals which are offered to anyone who is hungry. 

Meals are usually vegan or vegetarian, as stated in the groups principles. However, the Gainesville, Florida, US chapter, for example, serves meals that include animal products such as chicken, pork chops, brisket, steak and shrimp. 

According to FNB, the group&#x27;s central beliefs are:

* Meals are free to anyone. 
* Each chapter is independent and autonomous and makes decisions via consensus.
* Dedication to nonviolence.
* Views &quot;food as a right not a privilege.&quot;

Coinciding with these beliefs, the groups&#x27; goals are:

# To combat poverty and homelessness
# To facilitate community gatherings of hungry people
# To allow anyone to volunteer to help cook, and then eat.

== Activity ==
=== 1980s ===
Food Not Bombs was founded in 1980 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, by anti-nuclear activists Keith McHenry, Jo Swanson, Mira Brown, Susan Eaton, Brian Feigenbaum, C.T. Lawrence Butler, Jessie Constable and Amy Rothstien. According to Keith McHenry, the name came about when he discovered that they were distributing food to the poor just across the street from a new building development for Draper Labs where, rumor had it, they were designing nuclear weapons. McHenry says that it made the group realize that &quot;there are hungry people on one side of the street. There are people on the other that are making money making nuclear weapons. We should be called &#x27;Food Not Bombs. Co-founder, Keith McHenry has volunteered for 35 years and can be found sharing food almost every week in various cities including Santa Cruz, California, and Taos, New Mexico. The members&#x27; activities included providing food, marching, and protesting. They protested such things as nuclear power, United States&#x27; involvement in the Salvadoran Civil War, and discrimination against the homeless.

The first arrests for sharing free food (aka &#x27;sharing&#x27;) occurred on August 15, 1988 at the entrance to Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, California. Nine people were arrested that day, including McHenry. The city made over 1,000 arrests, and Amnesty International declared these volunteers &#x27;prisoners of conscience&#x27;.

=== 2000s ===

In the summer of 2007, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida FNB chapter began receiving systematic harassment from local law enforcement culminating in an ultimatum presented by the Fort Lauderdale police. The police demanded the arrest of volunteers responsible for the public &#x27;sharings&#x27;. The following week, hundreds of supporters for FNB managed to compel local law enforcement to relent, which lasted until the 2010s.

The city of Orlando, Florida enacted an ordinance prohibiting the serving of food to more than a specified number[&quot;how many?&quot;] of people without a permit. In the fall of 2007, Eric Montanez of Orlando&#x27;s FNB was charged with violating Orlando&#x27;s city ordinance. On October 10, 2007, Montanez was acquitted by a jury of the charge. FNB along with a church for the homeless (&quot;First Vagabonds Church of God&quot;) sued the city on the grounds that their food service is covered under the first amendment as a part of &quot;protected political speech and religious activity&quot;. The groups won the lawsuit and the city ordinance was overturned. The city of Orlando appealed to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and subsequently won. On August 31, 2010, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the decision, barring Orlando from enforcing the ordinance until another hearing before a 10-judge panel could take place.

In May 2008, local business owners attempted to stop the Kitchener, Ontario, FNB group from serving meals in a highly-visible downtown location, describing the group as &quot;supporting meat-free diets, anti-capitalism, and an end to Canada&#x27;s military intervention in Afghanistan.&quot;

In April 2009, the city of Middletown, Connecticut, issued a cease-and-desist order to the local chapter of FNB. Prior to the order, the city health inspector cited the organization for distributing food without a license. In August 2009, the chapter began operating through a licensed kitchen provided by the Middletown First Church of Christ Congregational as state hearings into the matter were held.

The most widely publicized restrictions on food sharing involving FNB were the 2011 feeding bans in Florida. Similar laws have been enacted in other jurisdictions, including Philadelphia and Houston.

=== 2010s ===
On April 12, 2011, an en banc panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Orlando ordinance as a valid &quot;time, place and manner&quot; regulation, reversing the initial ruling of &quot;First Vagabonds Church of God, An Unincorporated Association, Brian Nichols v. City of Orlando, Florida&quot; and removing the permanent injunction against the Orlando ordinance that was first attempted in 2007. The lawyer for Orlando FNB issued a cease and desist order to the city, saying that violating the ordinance was not an arrestable offense, and hackers claiming to be affiliated with Anonymous began issuing threats to the city of Orlando. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer received heavy criticism for referring to Food Not Bombs activists as &quot;food terrorists.&quot;

On June 20, Ben Markeson was cited for holding a sign without a permit, and hackers carried through with their threats and took down the Orlando Chamber of Commerce site and a Universal Studios website in &quot;Operation Orlando&quot;. On June 22, more arrests took place including a second arrest of McHenry. On July 1, after national and international attention and further hacks, OFNB accepted the Mayor&#x27;s suggestion to move sharings to City Hall, which stopped arrests and resulted in a new, stable arrangement for Orlando&#x27;s FNB.

A homeless hacktivist named Christopher Doyon, also known as &quot;Commander X&quot;, was eventually arrested for &quot;Operation Orlando&quot; and other activity. Soon after his arraignment he held a press statement where he admitted to all charges, but argued that the distributed denial of service attacks constituted acts of cyber-civil disobedience. On August 19, 2011, Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer held a press conference to announce that charges against food sharers arrested in Lake Eola Park, Orlando, were dropped, resulting in a new state of compromise between Buddy Dyer&#x27;s administration and Orlando Food Not Bombs.

An ordinance in Sarasota, Florida, in 2011 required a special event permit for gatherings of 75 or more people. Local condominium residents petitioned to require permits for even smaller groups of 12, as well as a permit for vending in public. Numerous other ordinances targeted the homeless, including the banning of smoking and removing park benches. At the time, homeless shelters in Gainesville, Florida could feed only 130 people at a time, leading to the formation of the Coalition To End The Meal Limit, who successfully lifted the meal limit and other rules in 2011.

Food Not Bombs groups were heavily involved in supporting occupation camps across the US during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement. A FNB kitchen was removed in a late-night police confrontation with Occupy San Francisco in mid-October. C.T. Lawrence Butler joined Occupy Boston. Keith McHenry participated in many camps and released a new FNB handbook.

A Food Not Bombs World Gathering took place August 20–26, 2012, in Tampa, Florida – the week before the Republican National Convention. In conjunction with Occupy Tampa and many other organizations, FNB activists collected and prepared food for hundreds of RNC protesters and offered workshops, cultural events, and protest activities from August 20–30.

Near the end of 2012, FNB activists, in particular, Long Island FNB, fed thousands of people in the wake of Superstorm Sandy alongside &quot;Occupy Sandy.&quot; The outpouring of food going to waste and support for disaster-stricken, impoverished communities culminated in the &quot;Largest Food Not Bombs Ever&quot; at the &quot;Hempstead Food Share Bonanza&quot; on Nov. 18th.

In November 2014, the city of Fort Lauderdale enacted a sharing ban. Several Food Not Bombs activists were arrested sharing food and other acts of civil disobedience, for which they received &quot;Civil Liberties Arrest&quot; medals from the Broward County ACLU. Other FNB activists went on hunger strike against enforcement of the law. A court injunction stopped enforcement of the sharing ban in early December 2014 pending several court cases. On August 22, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that outdoor food sharing by Food Not Bombs was protected under the First Amendment.

=== 2020s ===
A Food Not Bombs chapter in Houston had been issued 96 tickets since March of 2023. One case was dismissed for FNBHTX volunteer Aliene Adams and 7 cases were dismissed against FNBHTX volunteer Shere Dore, who carries 18 of the 96 citations. The following week, the city attorney refiled those dismissed cases against Adams and Dore. Food Not Bombs Houston received nationwide attention, including an article in the New York Times. As volunteers continued to receive citations, in January 2024 the group joined Texas Civil Rights Project and sued the City of Houston. In February 2024, Federal Judge Hanen ordered an injunction against the city ceasing further citations. In June 2024, the city of Houston filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and the motion was denied by Judge Hanen. The group now serves an upwards of 200 or more individuals. The group is expected to go to federal trial in October 2025. The group continues to serve hundreds of people 4 nights a week.
 The tickets were issued under a city ordinance enacted in 2012, which states that those wanting to distribute free meals to more than five people must first obtain operating permission from the property owner(s). In August, eight of the tickets were dismissed after representees from the Houston Police Department fail to show up. Mayor John Whitmire&#x27;s office stated, &quot;members of his administration look forward to meeting and working with interested parties regarding the Charitable Food Ordinance.&quot;

Three Food Not Bombs volunteers were charged in West Palm Beach, Florida, under a similar ordinance against sharing food with groups of people in September 2023.

==Globalization==

<text>Mr. Yuk is a trademarked graphic image, created by UPMC Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh, and widely employed in the United States in labeling of substances that are poisonous if ingested.

==Objective==

To help children learn to avoid ingesting poisons, Mr. Yuk was conceived by Richard Moriarty, a pediatrician and clinical professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who founded the Pittsburgh Poison Center and the National Poison Center Network. Moriarty felt that the traditional skull and crossbones representing poison was no longer appropriate for children; Congressman Bill Coyne later said that by the 1970s the symbol was &quot;associated with swashbuckling pirates and buccaneers rather than with harmful substances.&quot;

The design and color were chosen when Moriarty used focus groups of young children to determine which combination was the most unappealing. Possible expressions were &quot;mad&quot; (crossed eyes and intense expression), &quot;dead&quot; (a sunken mouth and Xs for eyes), and &quot;sick&quot; (a sour expression with the tongue sticking out). Children were asked to rank the faces according to which they liked the best, along with the skull and crossbones, and the &quot;sick&quot; face was least popular. The shade of fluorescent green that was chosen was christened &quot;Yucky!&quot; by a young child and gave the design its name.

==History==
In 1971 the Pittsburgh Poison Centre issued the Mr. Yuk sticker. Over the next few years, Mr. Yuk stickers were used nationwide to promote poison centres in the United States of America. The stickers usually contained phone numbers of poison control centers that may give guidance if poisoning has occurred or is suspected. Usually, Mr. Yuk stickers carried the national toll-free number &quot;1-800-222-1222&quot;. In some areas, local poison control centers and children&#x27;s hospitals issue stickers with local numbers, under license. A public service announcement was also produced in 1971 featuring a theme song.

==Effectiveness==
At least two peer-reviewed medical studies (Fergusson 1982, Vernberg 1984) have suggested that Mr. Yuk stickers do not effectively keep children away from potential poisons and may even attract children. Specifically, Vernberg and colleagues note concerns for using the stickers to protect young children. Fergusson and colleagues state that &quot;the method may be effective with older children or as an adjunct to an integrated poisoning prevention campaign&quot;.

To evaluate the effectiveness of six projected symbols (skull-and-crossbones, red stop sign, and four others), tests were conducted at day care centers. Children in the program rated Mr. Yuk as the most unappealing image. By contrast, children rated the skull-and-crossbones to be the most appealing.

== Licensing ==
Mr. Yuk and his graphic rendering are registered trademarks and service marks of the UPMC Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh, and the rendering itself is additionally protected by copyright. The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC gives out free sheets of Mr. Yuk stickers if contacted by mail.

== Modern usage ==
Given the evidence regarding the campaign&#x27;s effectiveness, some poison control centers no longer distribute Mr. Yuk stickers. However, as of May 2024, other poison control centers, such as the Pittsburgh Poison Center continue to offer stickers.

<doc id="522051" wikidata="Q2717850" url="?curid=522051" title="Sweden proper">
<text>Sweden proper (, literally &quot;Actual Sweden&quot;) is a term used to distinguish those territories that were fully integrated into the Kingdom of Sweden, as opposed to the dominions and possessions of, or states in union with, Sweden. Only the estates of the realm of Sweden proper were represented in the Riksdag of the Estates.

Specifically this means that, from approximately 1155–1156 until the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809, Sweden proper included the bulk of present-day Finland as a fully integrated part of the realm. After 1809, however, the term has been used to distinguish the western part from the former &quot;eastern half&quot; of the realm, i.e. Sweden from Finland.

Skåne, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, formerly parts of Denmark and Norway, came under the Swedish Crown by the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, but it was not until 1719 that they were fully integrated and became part of Sweden proper.

Sweden proper, a geographical reference that has changed over time, contrasts with Finland Proper, a province in southwestern Finland that gave its name to all of Finland.

<text>Kettle&#x27;s Yard is an art gallery and house in Cambridge, England. The director of the art gallery is Andrew Nairne. Both the house and gallery reopened in February 2018 after an expansion of the facilities.

== History and overview ==

Kettle&#x27;s Yard House and Gallery lies on the west side of Castle Street, between Northampton Street and St Peter&#x27;s Church.

It was originally the Cambridge home of Jim Ede and his wife Helen. Moving to Cambridge in 1956, they converted four small cottages with the help of Winton Aldridge into one idiosyncratic house and a place to display Ede&#x27;s collection of early 20th-century art. Ede maintained an &#x27;open house&#x27; each afternoon, giving any visitors, particularly students, a personal tour of his collection.

In 1966, Ede gave the house and collection to the University of Cambridge, but continued living there before he and his wife moved to Edinburgh in 1973. The house is preserved as the Edes left it, making a very informal space to enjoy the permanent collection and live music. In 1970, the house was extended, adding an exhibition gallery in a contrasting modernist style by Leslie Martin.

The house and gallery temporarily closed in June 2015 during a major building project to create a four-floor education wing, improved exhibition galleries, a new entrance area and a café. A series of gentle additions by Jamie Fobert Architects offers greatly improved support services for visitors, including a new courtyard and welcome area and a new shop. The project cost £11,000,000 including £2,320,000 from the Heritage Lottery Fund and £3,700,000 from Arts Council England. The interior of the house has been left untouched.

During the closure, there were displays of the collection at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings.

Kettle&#x27;s Yard is part of the University of Cambridge Museums consortium.

== Permanent collection ==
The permanent collection is composed of paintings, sculptures and objects collected by Ede. It is largely based on associations and friendships formed when Ede was a curator at Tate Gallery, and as such it is biased towards works from the British avant-garde of the first half of the 20th century.

Ian Hamilton Finlay described Ede&#x27;s &quot;fusion of art and found objects&quot; on an inscribed pebble as &quot;the Louvre of the pebble&quot;.

Notable artists represented in the collection are:
*Constantin Brâncuși
*William Congdon
*Helen Frankenthaler
*Henri Gaudier-Brzeska
*Ian Hamilton Finlay
*Barbara Hepworth
*David Jones
*Joan Miró
*Henry Moore
*Ben Nicholson
*David Peace 
*Winifred Nicholson
*Alfred Wallis
*Christopher Wood

<doc id="522062" wikidata="Q950292" url="?curid=522062" title="Engineering tolerance">
<text>Engineering tolerance is the permissible limit or limits of variation in:

# a physical dimension;
# a measured value or physical property of a material, manufactured object, system, or service;
# other measured values (such as temperature, humidity, etc.);
# in engineering and safety, a physical distance or space (tolerance), as in a truck (lorry), train or boat under a bridge as well as a train in a tunnel (see structure gauge and loading gauge);
# in mechanical engineering, the space between a bolt and a nut or a hole, etc.

Dimensions, properties, or conditions may have some variation without significantly affecting functioning of systems, machines, structures, etc. A variation beyond the tolerance (for example, a temperature that is too hot or too cold) is said to be noncompliant, rejected, or exceeding the tolerance.

==Considerations when setting tolerances==
A primary concern is to determine how wide the tolerances may be without affecting other factors or the outcome of a process. This can be by the use of scientific principles, engineering knowledge, and professional experience. Experimental investigation is very useful to investigate the effects of tolerances: Design of experiments, formal engineering evaluations, etc.

A good set of engineering tolerances in a specification, by itself, does not imply that compliance with those tolerances will be achieved. Actual production of any product (or operation of any system) involves some inherent variation of input and output. Measurement error and statistical uncertainty are also present in all measurements. With a normal distribution, the tails of measured values may extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations from the process average. Appreciable portions of one (or both) tails might extend beyond the specified tolerance.

The process capability of systems, materials, and products needs to be compatible with the specified engineering tolerances. Process controls must be in place and an effective quality management system, such as Total Quality Management, needs to keep actual production within the desired tolerances. A process capability index is used to indicate the relationship between tolerances and actual measured production.

The choice of tolerances is also affected by the intended statistical sampling plan and its characteristics such as the Acceptable Quality Level. This relates to the question of whether tolerances must be extremely rigid (high confidence in 100% conformance) or whether some small percentage of being out-of-tolerance may sometimes be acceptable.

==An alternative view of tolerances==
Genichi Taguchi and others have suggested that traditional two-sided tolerancing is analogous to &quot;goal posts&quot; in a football game: It implies that all data within those tolerances are equally acceptable. The alternative is that the best product has a measurement which is precisely on target. There is an increasing loss which is a function of the deviation or variability from the target value of any design parameter. The greater the deviation from target, the greater is the loss. This is described as the Taguchi loss function or &quot;quality loss function&quot;, and it is the key principle of an alternative system called &quot;inertial tolerancing&quot;.

Research and development work conducted by M. Pillet and colleagues at the Savoy University has resulted in industry-specific adoption. Recently the publishing of the French standard NFX 04-008 has allowed further consideration by the manufacturing community.

== Mechanical component tolerance ==

Dimensional tolerance is related to, but different from fit in mechanical engineering, which is a &quot;designed-in&quot; clearance or interference between two parts. Tolerances are assigned to parts for manufacturing purposes, as boundaries for acceptable build. No machine can hold dimensions precisely to the nominal value, so there must be acceptable degrees of variation. If a part is manufactured, but has dimensions that are out of tolerance, it is not a usable part according to the design intent. Tolerances can be applied to any dimension. The commonly used terms are:

; Basic size: The nominal diameter of the shaft (or bolt) and the hole. This is, in general, the same for both components.
; Lower deviation: The difference between the minimum possible component size and the basic size.
; Upper deviation: The difference between the maximum possible component size and the basic size.
; Fundamental deviation: The &quot;minimum&quot; difference in size between a component and the basic size.

This is identical to the upper deviation for shafts and the lower deviation for holes. If the fundamental deviation is greater than zero, the bolt will always be smaller than the basic size and he hole will always be wider. Fundamental deviation is a form of allowance, rather than tolerance.
; International Tolerance grade: This is a standardised measure of the &quot;maximum&quot; difference in size between the component and the basic size (see below).

For example, if a shaft with a nominal diameter of 10mm is to have a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10 mm (i.e., a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036 mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04 mm to 10.076 mm (0.04 mm fundamental deviation and 0.076 mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04 mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the &quot;Maximum Material Condition&quot; - MMC) and 0.112 mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole, &quot;Least Material Condition&quot; - LMC). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036 mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.

When no other tolerances are provided, the machining industry uses the following standard tolerances:


===International Tolerance grades===

When designing mechanical components, a system of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work in such a way that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size, h6 would mean 10+0−0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).

The table below summarises the International Tolerance (IT) grades and the general applications of these grades:

An analysis of fit by statistical interference is also extremely useful: It indicates the frequency (or probability) of parts properly fitting together.

== Electrical component tolerance ==
An electrical specification might call for a resistor with a nominal value of 100 Ω (ohms), but will also state a tolerance such as &quot;±1%&quot;. This means that any resistor with a value in the range 99–101Ω is acceptable. For critical components, one might specify that the actual resistance must remain within tolerance within a specified temperature range, over a specified lifetime, and so on.

Many commercially available resistors and capacitors of standard types, and some small inductors, are often marked with coloured bands to indicate their value and the tolerance. High-precision components of non-standard values may have numerical information printed on them.

Low tolerance means only a small deviation from the components given value, when new, under normal operating conditions and at room temperature. Higher tolerance means the component will have a wider range of possible values.

==Difference between &quot;allowance&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot;==
The terms are often confused but sometimes a difference is maintained. See .

==Clearance (civil engineering)==

In civil engineering, clearance refers to the difference between the loading gauge and the structure gauge in the case of railroad cars or trams, or the difference between the size of any vehicle and the width/height of doors, the width/height of an overpass or the diameter of a tunnel as well as the air draft under a bridge, the width of a lock or diameter of a tunnel in the case of watercraft. In addition there is the difference between the deep draft and the stream bed or sea bed of a waterway.

<doc id="522064" wikidata="Q429748" url="?curid=522064" title="TransMilenio">
<text>TransMilenio is a bus rapid transit (BRT) system that serves Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, and Soacha, a neighbouring city. The system opened to the public in December 2000. As of 2024, 12 lines totalling run throughout the city. It is part of the city&#x27;s Integrated Public Transport System (&quot;Sistema Integrado de Transporte Público&quot; [SITP]), along with the urban, complementary and special bus services operating on neighbourhood and main streets.

TransMilenio consists of several interconnected BRT lines, with raised floor stations in the center of a main avenue, or &quot;troncal&quot;. Passengers typically reach the stations via a bridge over the street. Usually four lanes down the center of the street are dedicated to bus traffic. The outer lanes allow express buses to bypass buses stopped at a station.

As of 2024, 1,801 buses on average were circulating on the trunk line system. An additional set of 869 regular buses, known as &quot;feeders&quot; (&quot;alimentadores&quot; in Spanish), carry passengers from certain important stations to many different locations that the main route does not reach. Unlike the main TransMilenio buses, feeders operate without dedicated lanes, are not articulated and are either green or blue (regular TransMilenio buses are red). There is no additional fare to use the feeder buses.

There are 27 bicycle parking facilities in main TransMilenio stations with 7,351 parking spaces to facilitate cyclists using the system. Eight BRT corridors were certified in 2013 to meet the BRT standard with excellence: Autonorte and Caracas silver, Americas, Calle 80, Eldorado, NQS and Suba gold.

==History==
===Background===

Before TransMilenio, Bogotá&#x27;s mass transit &quot;system&quot; consisted of thousands of independently operated and uncoordinated mini buses. There was also a plan for a network of elevated highways throughout Bogotá, and plans to build a subway as Medellín had done seven years prior. When Enrique Peñalosa was elected mayor he cancelled these projects and oversaw the construction of the initial TransMilenio system at a fraction of the cost.

===Construction and opening===

The mayor created a special company to build the project and run the central system. The operational design of TransMilenio was undertaken by transport consultants Steer Davies Gleave with the financial structuring of the project led by Capitalcorp S.A., a local investment bank. Most of the money required to build TransMilenio was provided by the Colombian central government, while the city of Bogotá provided the remaining 30%.

Within three years after the initiation of the project, the first phase opened in December 2000, covering Caracas Avenue and 80 street. Other lines were added gradually over the next several years. Prior to construction, a 30 km trip by public transport would take 2 hours and 15 minutes in 1998; the same trip using TransMilenio now takes 55 minutes.

In the beginning, most buses were diesel-powered, purchased from such manufacturers as the Colombian-Brazilian company Marcopolo-Superior, German conglomerate Mercedes-Benz, and Swedish companies such as Volvo and Scania. The buses were articulated and had a capacity of 160 passengers each. In May 2007, a new, larger bi-articulated bus, with capacity for 270 passengers, was presented to the public.

Bogotá won the first Sustainable Transport Award in 2005 due to the BRT system and urban cycling strategy.

On May 2 and 3, 2006, several groups of bus drivers not associated with TransMilenio held a strike, protesting against some elements and consequences of the system. They disagreed with the amount of monetary compensation that they would receive in exchange for the disposal of old buses (10 to more than 20 years old), traffic restrictions on the TransMilenio main lines, and a new &quot;Pico y Placa Ambiental&quot; in some city areas, that would restrict the schedules of buses older than 10 years to early morning hours to reduce pollution in the city.
Since the May 2006 expansion, the TransMilenio route system has changed dramatically, with new sections added to the system.

Due to the relatively high price, overcrowding, and delays in the routes, hundreds of people, mostly students protesting and some vandals looted and broke windows on March 9, 2012, causing half a million dollars of damage and 11 injuries. The vandals were confronted and detained by riot police.

At the end of 2018, Transmilenio ordered 1383 new buses as a replacement of the older ones in service. 52% were compressed natural gas (CNG) buses made by Scania with Euro 6 emission rating, 48% were diesel engine made by Volvo with Euro 5 emission rating. More orders have produced an impressive result: &quot;To improve public and environmental health, the City of Bogotá has assembled a fleet of 1,485 electric buses for its public transportation system—placing the city among the three largest e-bus fleets outside of China.&quot;

Bogotá won the Sustainable Transport Award again in 2022 also thanks to the continued expansion and success of TransMilenio.

==Infrastructure==
TransMilenio has 12 lines serving 152 stations in the cities of Bogotá and Soacha:
* Caracas between Calle 76 and Tercer Milenio: 14 stations
* Autonorte between Terminal and Héroes: 17 stations
* Suba between Portal de Suba and San Martín: 14 stations
* Calle 80 between Portal de la 80 and Polo: 14 stations
* NQS Central between La Castellana and Tygua - San José: 13 stations
* Américas between Portal de Las Américas and Avenida Jiménez: 18 stations (including Ricaurte station)
* NQS Sur between Comuneros and San Mateo: 17 stations
* Caracas Sur between Hospital and Portal de Usme and Portal del Tunal: 17 stations
* Eje Ambiental between Museo del Oro and Universidades: 3 stations
* Calle 26, between Portal Eldorado and Centro Memoria: 13 stations
* Carrera Décima between Portal 20 de Julio and San Diego: 10 stations
* Carrera Séptima: Museo Nacional: 1 station

Instead of being numbered, routes have a combination of letters and numbers. In order to fill the information gap, TransMilenio made available an interactive guide that includes routes, stations, nearby places and route combinations.

Construction of a new line in Carrera 7 (North-Downtown) is under consideration. This has been criticized as there are certain locations where the system might not fit.

===Vehicles===

TransMilenio buses are not equipped with transponders to give them signal priority. Regret over this decision was voiced by the former general manager of the system, Angelica Castro.

===Stations===
There are six types of stations:
* &quot;Sencillas&quot; (Simple): local service stations, located approximately every 500 m
* &quot;De transferencia&quot; (Transfer): allow transfer between different lines through a tunnel
* &quot;Sin intercambio&quot; (No transfer): do not allow transfer between lanes (north-south, south–north, west–east, east–west); located in the Autopista Norte (due to a stretch of the road), Tunal and 6th Street ramification (due to water channels).
* &quot;Intermedias&quot; (Intermediate): service both feeder and trunk line.
* &quot;Cabecera&quot; (Portal): near the entrances to the city. In addition to feeders and articulated buses, intercity buses from the metropolitan area also arrive at these stations.
* Paraderos bus dual (dual-bus stop): located in the streets, these stops don&#x27;t have turnstiles, electronic boards and the floor level is the same of the street; served by buses with station-level and street-level doors. These stops are located in the pretrunk corridors (AK 7, AV Caracas, AV Suba, AC 80, AV El Dorado).
All stations have electronic boards announcing the approximate arrival time of the next bus. Wait times are short as there is usually a bus serving the station. There are also station attendants to provide assistance to the passengers, and posted system maps.

Users pay at the station entrance using a smart card, pass through a turnstile, and wait for buses inside the station, which is typically 5 m wide. The bus and station doors open simultaneously, and passengers board by walking across the threshold. The elevated station platform and the bus floor are at the same height.

TransMilenio stations comply with easy access regulations because they are elevated and have ramps leading to the entrance. The &quot;alimentadores&quot; (feeders) are normal buses without handicapped accessibility. A lawsuit by disabled user Daniel Bermúdez caused a ruling that all feeder systems must comply with easy access regulations by 2004, but this has not happened yet.

==Services==


The zoning divides the trunks into 12 lines or zones that have different letters and colors. The maps changed at each station, to show the specific services to the station in question and the way to reach the other zones of the system from there.

The trunk system has three types of services:
* Regular Routes &quot;(Ruta Fácil)&quot;: These are the numbered routes from 1 to 9 that stop at all stations and work all day. As of August 2008, this type of service was called the Easy Route. On June 17, 2017, these services were modified, replacing the routes that operated since 2006 by shorter trails, in addition to a change of nomenclature, which did not include the letter and the color of the destination area. 
* Express &quot;(Expreso)&quot;: Routes that only stop at the stations determined in their route, and are numbered from 10 to 75.
* Dual bus trunk &quot;(Troncal Bus Dual)&quot;: Routes to extend the TransMilenio trunk service to arteries, beginning with the Carrera Séptima.

== Fares and tickets==
The fare is 3,200 Colombian pesos for a single trip (about €0.7 or US$0.75). Cards use a contactless smart card (MIFARE) system, and multiple trips may be purchased using one card.
==Costs, ridership, and impact==
According to a United States Transportation Research Board (TRB) case study report, the initial construction cost for the first phase of 41 km was US$240 million, or US$5.9 million/km. In a report presented later by the Ministry of Transport of Colombia, the total cost of the construction of Transmilenio phase one was estimated at 1.4 billion COP (about US$703 million), of which 253.053 million COP (about US$126.5 million) was provided by the Colombian government. The construction of the phase two was estimated at 3.2 billion COP (about US$1634 million), of which 2.1 billion COP (about US$1058 million) was provided by the Colombian government and the rest was provided by the city. The numbers of this report are calculated in money of 2009.

The system is overseen by a public body, which awards contracts to private bus companies on a competitive basis. According to TRB, private contractors are paid based on the total number of kilometers that their vehicles operate.

Daily ridership quickly reached 800,000 after the system opened. TransMilenio has since been expanded. Ridership in early 2006 was 1,050,000 daily, in 2009 it was 1,400,000 daily and in September 2018 it was 2.4 million on a weekday.

Other cities are building systems modelled on Transmilenio, for example, Mexico City, and Transantiago in Santiago, Chile, however, in these cities the system is complemented with a Rapid transit system.

==Controversies==

=== User strikes ===
In 2016, Transmilenio had an 86% disapproval rating from users. User strikes erupted over bad service quality, with users blocking bus lanes and at times halting the entire system. These protests sometimes devolved into riots involving heavy police presence and the use of crowd control measures such as tear gas and water cannons.

=== Overcrowding ===
The system was described by users, independent bodies and the media as suffering from overcrowding with an average of eight passengers per square meter, insecurity and providing bad customer service. During rush hours, &quot;stations are so packed that people can&#x27;t get off the bus&quot;. In some stations, overcrowding was so severe that users had to wait in a long line to top up their Smart card and another line to enter the station. According to official data in 2017, there were 3404 thefts in TransMilenio stations and 1442 more on buses.

=== Construction ===
During construction, there were problems with the concrete used to pave the dedicated roads, which had an estimated cost to the city of 1.6 trillion pesos (500 million dollars). In 2012, Bogota&#x27;s secretary of finance said that the whole line of Avenida Caracas should be rebuilt as well as some parts of the Avenida 26 line.

===Air pollution===
In 2015 a study made by the National University of Colombia revealed that 70% of the air pollution near Transmilenio exits was caused by the buses of the first phase. According to official data, more than 50% of the first and second phase buses broke atmospheric emissions rules. There was controversy around the fact that the Transmilenio buses were diesel-powered. Some academics, councillors and citizens called the buses dangerous as diesel fuels are carcinogens according to the World Health Organization, and pointed out calls to ban them in other cities like Stuttgart and Stockholm.

===Sexual assaults===
Women in Bogotá have stated that the overcrowding in the system makes it easy for criminals to attack women and go unnoticed. According to a 2012 survey conducted by the Secretary for Women&#x27;s Issues of Bogotá, 64% of women said they have been victims of sexual assault in the system. Several policies have been adopted in order to confront this problem, like an exclusive bus for women, and special undercover policewomen. However, no measures have been effective against the problem, and sexual assaults continued to occur in 2018.

===Broken buses===
In 2017 and 2018, many incidents with Transmilenio buses had been reported while they were operating. There have been cases of buses being burned due to mechanical problems, one bus broken in half, tires flying off the buses and hitting cars, and users reporting that water leaks into the buses when it rains.

<doc id="522065" wikidata="Q7614864" url="?curid=522065" title="Steven J. Ostro">
<text>Steven Jeffrey Ostro (March 9, 1946 – December 15, 2008) was an American scientist specializing in radar astronomy. He worked at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Ostro led radar observations of numerous asteroids, as well as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, Saturn&#x27;s rings, and Mars and its satellites. As of May 2008, Ostro and his collaborators had detected 222 near-Earth asteroids, including 130 potentially hazardous objects and 24 binaries, and 118 main belt objects with radar.

He died December 15, 2008, due to complications related to cancer. He has been remembered fondly by his colleagues for both his personal and professional contributions.

==Education and employment==
Ostro received an A.B. in liberal arts and a B.S. in ceramic science from Rutgers University in 1969, a Master&#x27;s in engineering physics from Cornell University in 1974, and his Ph.D in planetary science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978. At MIT, Ostro was advised by Gordon Pettengill and Irwin I. Shapiro and studied the radar scattering properties of Saturn&#x27;s rings and the Galilean satellites using the Arecibo Observatory.

After completing his graduate work and a year in postdoctoral research at MIT, Ostro served as an assistant professor of astronomy at Cornell before moving to JPL in 1984. Ostro headed JPL&#x27;s Asteroid Radar group, and was a member of the Cassini–Huygens RADAR team, studying the moons of Saturn. In 2008, Ostro was elected a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, awarded for acknowledged eminence in the Earth and Space sciences.

==Asteroid radar astronomy==
Much of Ostro&#x27;s career focused on the development of asteroid radar astronomy. In early experiments, such as the first radar detection of Ceres, radar observations of asteroids were restricted to measurements of Doppler shifts and radar cross-sections. Beginning in the early 1980s, Ostro led the development of radar imaging and shape-reconstruction techniques, first determining only outer limits of targets&#x27; shapes, then deriving three-dimensional shape models.

From August 19 to 22 of 1989, Ostro and Scott Hudson observed the contact binary 4769 Castalia from the Arecibo Observatory, producing the first resolved radar images of an asteroid, which they later used to construct a model of the object. Following the further development of imaging and shape reconstruction techniques by Ostro, Hudson, and Christopher Magri, and the upgrade of Arecibo in the mid-1990s, the number of radar observations increased dramatically.

==Asteroid impact hazard==
Ostro was an early participant in discussion of the asteroid impact hazard, placing particular emphasis on the need to characterize asteroids before any deflection attempt. In a paper with Carl Sagan, Ostro noted that while the asteroid impact hazard is a long-term risk to any civilization, the risk associated with maintaining an active deflection program is higher, because it is just as easy to deflect an asteroid to impact Earth as to prevent it from doing so. Ostro advocated for continued funding of the Arecibo Planetary Radar, on both hazard and scientific grounds.

==Notable asteroids observed by Ostro include==
*216 Kleopatra – a large main-belt asteroid, the first asteroid confirmed to have a surface composition of nickel-iron.
*1986 DA – the first near-Earth asteroid confirmed to be metallic. The estimated amount of platinum-group metals in 1986 DA is comparable to that in the Bushveld Igneous Complex, the largest source on Earth&#x27;s surface.
*4769 Castalia – the first near-Earth asteroid imaged well enough to determine its shape, which is two distinct 0.9 km lobes in contact (a contact binary).
*4179 Toutatis – a contact binary asteroid that is in a non-principal axis rotation state.
* – a large near-Earth asteroid that rotates exceptionally slowly.
* – a very small (30 m wide) asteroid that spins so quickly that it has negative effective gravity.
*66391 Moshup – one of the first binary near-Earth asteroids known. The shape of the primary (alpha) has been determined by inversion of radar images. This enabled studies of the orbital evolution of the secondary (beta), which is in turn coupled to the system&#x27;s orbit around the Sun by radiation forces.
*6489 Golevka – the first asteroid for which the Yarkovsky effect (radiation force changing the orbit) was measured.
*1950 DA – an approximately 1 km wide asteroid with a possible Earth impact in 2880.
*99942 Apophis – a near-Earth asteroid that will pass within geosynchronous orbit in 2029. Radar astrometry from observations by Ostro&#x27;s group have been essential to predicting Apophis&#x27; trajectory.

To explore the dynamical implications of these observations in detail, Ostro collaborated with Steven Chesley, Jon D. Giorgini, Scott Hudson, Jean-Luc Margot, and Daniel J. Scheeres.

Radar provides extremely accurate measurement of the positions and velocities of target objects, and such astrometry of near-Earth objects has been recognized as crucial to dealing with the impact hazard. In many cases, radar astrometry has excluded possible Earth impacts from trajectory predictions years before optical astrometry would have been able to do so.

==Work on other objects==
Ostro worked on radar observations of the icy satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, particularly with the Cassini-Huygens RADAR instrument. Radar observations of Mars&#x27; moons, Phobos and Deimos, have refined knowledge of their orbits and show that their surfaces are coated with very low density (~1 g/cm3) material, most likely fine-grain dust, to a depth of several meters.

==Honors==

===Awards===
* Gerard P. Kuiper Prize from the American Astronomical Society&#x27;s Division for Planetary Sciences (2003)
* NASA Distinguished Service Medal, posthumous (2010)
* NASA Medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement (1991 and 2004)

===Eponym===
* 3169 Ostro, asteroid named after Ostro in 1981

===Erdős Number===
Three, through Robert Connelly and Peter J. Cameron

<doc id="522069" wikidata="Q922718" url="?curid=522069" title="Sulfonate">
<text>In organosulfur chemistry, a sulfonate is a salt, anion or ester of a sulfonic acid. Its formula is , containing the functional group , where R is typically an organyl group, amino group or a halogen atom. Sulfonates are the conjugate bases of sulfonic acids. Sulfonates are generally stable in water, non-oxidizing, and colorless. Many useful compounds and even some biochemicals feature sulfonates.

==Sulfonate salts==
Anions with the general formula are called sulfonates. They are the conjugate bases of sulfonic acids with formula . As sulfonic acids tend to be strong acids, the corresponding sulfonates are weak bases. Due to the stability of sulfonate anions, the cations of sulfonate salts such as scandium triflate have application as Lewis acids.

A classic preparation of sulfonates is the Strecker sulfite alkylation, in which an alkali sulfite salt displaces a halide, typically in the presence of an iodine catalyst: 

An alternative is the condensation of a sulfonyl halide with an alcohol in pyridine:

==Sulfonic esters==
Esters with the general formula R1SO2OR2 are called &quot;sulfonic esters&quot;. Individual members of the category are named analogously to how ordinary carboxyl esters are named. For example, if the R2 group is a methyl group and the R1 group is a trifluoromethyl group, the resulting compound is methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate.

Sulfonic esters are used as reagents in organic synthesis, chiefly because the RSO3− group is a good leaving group, especially when R is electron-withdrawing. Methyl triflate, for example, is a strong methylating reagent.

Sulfonates are commonly used to confer water solubility to protein crosslinkers such as &quot;N&quot;-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS), BS3, Sulfo-SMCC, etc.

===Sultones===

Cyclic sulfonic esters are called sultones. Two examples are propane-1,3-sultone and 1,4-butane sultone. Some sultones are short-lived intermediates, used as strong alkylating agents to introduce a negatively charged sulfonate group. In the presence of water, they slowly hydrolyze to the hydroxy sulfonic acids. Sultone oximes are key intermediates in the synthesis of the anti-convulsant drug zonisamide.

Tisocromide is an example of a sultone.

==Examples==
*Mesylate (methanesulfonate), 
*Triflate (trifluoromethanesulfonate), 
*Ethanesulfonate (esilate, esylate), 
*Tosylate (&quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonate), &quot;p&quot;-
*Benzenesulfonate (besylate), 
*Closilate (closylate, chlorobenzenesulfonate), 
*Camphorsulfonate (camsilate, camsylate), 
*Pipsylate (&quot;p&quot;-iodobenzenesulfonate derivative), &quot;p&quot;-, where R is any group.
*Nosylate (&quot;o&quot;- or &quot;p&quot;-nitrobenzenesulfonate), &quot;o&quot;- or &quot;p&quot;-

==See also==
*Sulfate
*Sulfoxide
*Sulfonyl

<doc id="522070" wikidata="Q2078402" url="?curid=522070" title="Ode to Billie Joe">
<text>&quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Bobbie Gentry released by Capitol Records in July 1967, and later used as the title-track of her debut album. Five weeks after its release, the song topped &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop singles chart. It also appeared in the top 10 of the Adult Contemporary and Hot R&amp;B singles charts, and in the top 20 of the Hot Country Songs list. 

The song takes the form of a first-person narrative performed over sparse acoustic guitar accompaniment with strings in the background. It tells of a rural Mississippi family&#x27;s reaction to the news of the suicide of Billie Joe McAllister, a local boy to whom the daughter (and narrator) is (unknown by the rest of the family) connected. The song received widespread attention, leaving its audience intrigued as to what the narrator and Billie Joe threw off the Tallahatchie Bridge. Gentry later clarified that she intended the song to portray the family&#x27;s indifference to the suicide in what she deemed &quot;a study in unconscious cruelty,&quot; while she remarked the object thrown was not relevant to the message. 

&quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; was nominated for eight Grammy Awards; Gentry and arranger Jimmie Haskell won three between them. Gentry&#x27;s writing was adapted for the 1976 film &quot;Ode to Billy Joe.&quot; The song appeared on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; lists, 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and Greatest Country Songs, while &quot;Pitchfork&quot; featured it on their 200 Best Songs of the 1960s list. In 2023, the song was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry.

==Background and recording==
Singer-songwriter Bobbie Gentry was born in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. After her parents divorced, she continued to live there with her paternal grandparents. At age 13, Gentry moved to California to live with her mother. She graduated from high school and entered UCLA as a philosophy major, before transferring to the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. After she met Jody Reynolds at one of his concerts, Gentry took part in a recording session with him to sing two duets. Singer-songwriter Jim Ford introduced Gentry to record companies and music publishers. Ford took Gentry to Del-Fi Records, where he presented &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; to the label&#x27;s A&amp;R man Barry White. Ford claimed credit for writing the song, telling White he had brought Gentry along because he felt he could not sing it himself. The composition impressed White, and Ford expressed an interest in selling it to him. White took the song to Del-Fi Records president Bob Keane, who did not like it and refused to make a purchase. 

Capitol Records producer Kelly Gordon received Gentry&#x27;s demo for &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot;. Gordon liked it, and he asked for a B-side for the song. Gentry planned to sell &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; to Capitol Records, and she decided that recording the demo herself was cheaper than using a professional singer. The song&#x27;s recording happened soon after Gentry&#x27;s session that yielded &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot; in February 1967, while Bobby Paris assisted her in the studio in exchange for guitar session work on some of his own studio recordings. Gentry intended to have Lou Rawls record the song. Larry Shayne, Gentry&#x27;s publisher, warned Gordon against adding a rhythm section to the track. Shayne was a friend of David Axelrod, Capitol Record&#x27;s main A&amp;R man. He sold Axelrod recording rights to the song for $10,000 (). Gordon liked Gentry&#x27;s vocals on the demo, but he decided to add a sparse instrumental arrangement to the recording. Gordon called Jimmie Haskell, who prepared an arrangement for string sextet with four violins and two cellos. Jesse Erlich played one cello like a double bass. Haskell felt the song sounded like a film and decided to write the arrangement as if it were a score. Gordon then overdubbed Gentry&#x27;s recording with the strings. He determined that &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; would be the A-side of the single.

Haskell later claimed that a seven-minute recording of the song existed, but that Gordon cut it to under five minutes for radio airplay. The existence of a seven-minute version has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, a manuscript of a draft of the song donated by Gentry to the University of Mississippi contained verses that were not included on the final recording.

==Content==
&quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; takes the form of a first-person narrative by the young daughter of a Mississippi Delta family. It offers fragments of dinnertime conversation on the day that a local boy, an acquaintance of the narrator, jumped to his death from a nearby bridge. The account is interspersed with everyday, polite, mealtime conversation. The song&#x27;s last verse conveys the passage of events over the following year. 

The song begins on June 3 with the narrator, her brother and her father returning from farming chores to the family house for dinner. After reminding them to wipe their feet, the mother announces she received news from Choctaw Ridge: &quot;Billie Joe McAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.&quot; The verse is repeated through the song as the story develops to &quot;heighten the mystery.&quot; Unmoved, the father comments that &quot;Billie Joe never had a lick of sense&quot; before asking for the biscuits and adding &quot;there&#x27;s five more acres in the lower forty, I&#x27;ve got to plow.&quot; The brother then expresses his surprise, but continues eating his meal. 

The mother notices her daughter is distraught and not eating. She mentions the &quot;young preacher&quot; Brother Taylor visited the house earlier and that they would have dinner with him on Sunday. As an afterthought, the mother adds the preacher saw Billie Joe with a girl that &quot;looked a lot&quot; like the daughter and that &quot;she and Billie Joe was throwin&#x27; somethin&#x27; off the Tallahatchie Bridge.&quot; A year later, the brother marries and moves to Tupelo, Mississippi, while the father dies of an unnamed virus. Even though she expresses no sadness over her father&#x27;s death, the daughter notices her mother is still distraught by it. Rather than consoling her, she routinely picks flowers and throws them off the bridge. 

The song became a success because it created listener curiosity, given that Gentry did not mention what was thrown off of the bridge or why Billie Joe committed suicide. It features perfect rhymes from the first to the sixth line of every verse. Meanwhile, the fifth and sixth lines of the song repeat the rhyme of &quot;ridge&quot; and &quot;bridge&quot; in every stanza. The composition does not have a chorus. The musical phrases begin with pickup notes, while melismas and downbeats are used for the rhymes. 

===Gentry&#x27;s comments on the lyrics===
In August 1967, Gentry told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; she wanted to show &quot;people&#x27;s lack of ability&quot; to empathize with others&#x27; &quot;tragedy.&quot; She pointed out the mother, who noticed but did not understand her daughter&#x27;s lack of appetite, while later the daughter is unaware of the similarity of her mother&#x27;s behavior after the father dies. Gentry explained that both characters had &quot;isolated themselves in their own personal tragedies&quot; and remained unconcerned for the others. The songwriter compared the end product to a play. On the object thrown off the Tallahatchie Bridge, she commented that the audience had found more meanings than she had intended. Gentry mentioned that theories of the time included a baby, a wedding ring and flowers. While she indicated that what happened at the bridge was the motivation behind Billie Joe&#x27;s suicide, she also left it open to the listener&#x27;s interpretation. Gentry said she had no answer and her sole motivation was to show &quot;people&#x27;s apathy&quot;. 

In an interview with the Associated Press in November 1967, Gentry called the song &quot;a study in unconscious cruelty.&quot; She also said that audiences were still asking her what was thrown off the bridge rather than noticing &quot;the thoughtlessness of people expressed in the song,&quot; adding that what had been thrown was unimportant. She said people suggested to her it was a draft card, or a bottle of LSD pills. The songwriter clarified that she knew what it was, but said she considered it irrelevant to the story and deliberately left that interpretation open. Gentry remarked that the song&#x27;s message revolved around the &quot;nonchalant way&quot; the family discussed the suicide. She also said that what was thrown off of the bridge was included because it established a relationship between Billie Joe and the daughter, providing &quot;a possible motivation for his suicide the next day&quot;. The interview ended with Gentry&#x27;s suggestion that it could have been a wedding ring. Gentry told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1969: &quot;I had my own idea what it was while I was writing it, but it&#x27;s not that important. Actually it was something symbolic. But I&#x27;ve never told anyone what it was, not even my own dear mother.&quot;

==Release and reception==

The single &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot;-&quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; was released in July 1967. Paris was given a co-producer credit on the single with Gordon. Five weeks after its release, it reached number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. By the sixth week, the single had sold one million copies. It also appeared at number 7 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Adult Contemporary chart, at number 8 on the Hot R&amp;B singles chart, and number 17 on the Hot Country Songs chart. &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; year-end chart placed the song at number 3, while Canada&#x27;s RPM placed it at number 16.

In Australia, the song reached number 4 on &quot;Go-Set&#x27;s&quot; National Top 40. Meanwhile, it peaked at number 6 on the Irish Singles Chart. On the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; chart, the song reached number 3.

In November 1967, &quot;Life&quot; published an article about the song&#x27;s success after a visit with Gentry and her parents in Mississippi. Gentry showed the journalists a bridge in Money, Mississippi, that featured the characteristics of the one she wrote about as she clarified: &quot;this is what I had in mind&quot; she continued: &quot;The river isn&#x27;t very deep here, but the current is strong.&quot; Gentry was photographed crossing the bridge for the story. The single was nominated in eight categories at the 10th Annual Grammy Awards and won three: Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, Best New Artist, and Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals. By 1969, Gentry estimated the single had sold three million copies. 

Gentry sued Paris to have his co-producer credit removed, claiming she was the recording&#x27;s sole producer. Paris&#x27;s credit was removed on the album release. Soon after she left Capitol Records, Paris sued Gentry for $100,000 and the label for $300,000 in punitive damages for failing to pay him one fifth of the royalties from the song&#x27;s sales. Gentry and Paris testified against one another in the 1973 case. The jury awarded Paris one percent of the total royalties from &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; and &quot;Mississippi Delta&quot;, that amounted to $32,277.40 (). Gentry told Penny Anderson of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1974 that she originally produced &quot;Ode To Billie Joe&quot; and most of her recordings, adding that &quot;a woman doesn&#x27;t stand much chance in a recording studio. A staff producer&#x27;s name was nearly always put on the records.&quot; Gentry expressed the desire to gain more control over the production of her songs and recordings.

===Critical reception===
The staff of &quot;Billboard&quot; welcomed the release as &quot;fascinating material and performance&quot; with a &quot;potent lyric content that is worth the unusual length of the disk&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Leonard Feather considered it an &quot;aural parallel&quot; to the film &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; (1967), deeming them both &quot;sardonic, knife-edge studies of human nature&quot;. Feather concluded Gentry added &quot;a durable new dimension&quot; to American &quot;contemporary folklore&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented on the success of the song four weeks after its release. Critic John S. Wilson felt the song was &quot;a most unlikely candidate for success,&quot; as it was &quot;long by radio programming standards&quot; and he considered the topic &quot;nothing startling, nothing strange, nothing particularly original,&quot; Wilson remarked the lyrics had &quot;something to say about indifference ... which, after a couple of clarifying hearings, drifts off into the midst of forgotten poesy&quot;.

Nixon Smiley wrote in his piece for the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; that &quot;not since William Faulkner wrote &quot;As I Lay Dying&quot; has anything come out of Mississippi as earthy and as fundamental&quot; as &#x27;Ode to Billie Joe.&#x27;&quot; Smiley determined that upon &quot;casual hearing there seems to be nothing great about the song, the lyrics or the rendition,&quot; but that it &quot;captivated both the young and old.&quot; He noted disc jockeys were &quot;surprised, even flabbergasted,&quot; and &quot;sometimes disgusted&quot;.

The &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot; found the song &quot;hard to classify.&quot; It remarked that it &quot;has [a] rhythm and blues beat, and it&#x27;s clever,&quot; and also noted the presence of mystery. The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; called it &quot;one of the most haunting songs of the year.&quot; The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;the lyrics are too much&quot; and that &quot;after a few listenings, the subject matter becomes clear, and the message gets across.&quot; The review pointed out that &quot;musically, the song is as fine as it is lyrically inventive&quot; and that it &quot;grips with heretofore taboo themes.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song at #51 on its 200 Greatest Country Songs of All Time ranking.

==Legacy==
Following the success of the single, Capitol Records received 500,000 pre-orders for &quot;Ode to Billie Joe,&quot; surpassing the label&#x27;s record held by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot; Gentry began receiving offers to make a motion picture based on the song in 1967, but she rejected them, preferring to wait for an offer from a movie maker who would &quot;portray Billie Joe and his girlfriend in a serious, sensitive manner.&quot; In 1975, Gentry and Shayne accepted an offer from Max Baer Jr., who decided to direct the film. Baer said his interest was to have two unknown young people &quot;because the audience has to believe they are Bobbie and Billie Joe.&quot; The film would be shot on location in Mississippi with a budget of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Warner Bros. commissioned Herman Raucher to write an adaptation of the song for the upcoming film; Raucher&#x27;s adaptation and novel were both titled &quot;Ode to Billy Joe.&quot; Gentry was present during the shooting and contributed a musical score. At the time of the production, she told United Press International that the film would &quot;answer many questions left unanswered by the song.&quot; The film starred Robby Benson as Billy Joe and Glynnis O&#x27;Connor as Bobbie Lee. It was released in 1976. In the adaptation, the pair throw a rag doll off of the bridge, while a homosexual experience with the owner of the sawmill is established as the reason for Billy Joe&#x27;s suicide.

&quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; reappeared on the charts in 1976. It charted at number 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and in Canada at numbers 92 and 42 on the RPM Top Singles and Adult Contemporary charts, respectively.

After hearing &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; on the radio, Tony Joe White was inspired to write songs. White felt that his own life experience resembled that of Billie Joe, as he inhabited a similar place during his childhood and he remarked that the song was &quot;real.&quot; Soon after, White composed &quot;Polk Salad Annie&quot; (1969). By 1969, Leflore County established a fine of $180 () for people who jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge and the other bridges of the area. The county estimated that between 40 and 50 men had jumped off the structure, but none had died. The bridge collapsed in June 1972 after a fire and a new one was built in its place. In 2013, a memorial marker for the song was added south of the new bridge as part of the Mississippi Country Music Trail.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Ode To Billie Joe&quot; at number 419 on its 2003 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. The publication also listed it at number 47 on its 100 Greatest Country Songs in 2014; Richard Gehr deemed the track a &quot;sultry country blues that drifts downstream on Gentry&#x27;s ominous acoustic guitar.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed it at number 144 on its 200 Best Songs of the 1960s list. The song was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023, based on its &quot;cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation&#x27;s recorded sound heritage.&quot;

In 1999, the 1967 recording of &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; by Bobbie Gentry on Capitol Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Other versions===
In August 1967, Margie Singleton released a cover of the song that reached number 40 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Country Singles. Ray Bryant&#x27;s version (an instrumental) reached number 89 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100 and number 34 on their Adult Contemporary chart soon after. King Curtis charted with his cover (another instrumental version) at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, also in 1967, and at number 6 on the R&amp;B chart. Also in 1967, Joe Dassin released a cover of the song in French, entitled &quot;Marie-Jeanne.&quot; In the song, the main character is a man, while Marie-Jeanne jumps off of the Garonne bridge. 

A parody by Bob Dylan entitled &quot;Clothes Line Saga&quot;, originally recorded in 1967, was released on the 1975 album &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. It mimicked the conversational style of &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; with lyrics concentrating on routine household chores. The shocking event buried in all the mundane details is a revelation that &quot;The Vice-President&#x27;s gone mad!.&quot; Dylan&#x27;s song was originally titled &quot;Answer to &#x27;Ode&#x27;&quot;.

Bobbie Gentry re-recorded the song for the film Ode to Billy Joe, with the spelling of the name changed to &quot;Billy.&quot; Gentry stated that the original spelling had been a typographical error; this is corroborated by her original handwritten lyrics of the song. &quot;Ode to Billy Joe - Main Title&quot; was issued as a single in April 1976. It peaked at No. 65 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Capitol Records, Gentry&#x27;s label when the original 1967 recording was released, reissued it as a single in June 1976 to capitalize on the film&#x27;s success.

Sinéad O&#x27;Connor performed the song in 1995 on the compilation album Help, a fundraiser for the charity War Child. This downtempo version of the song includes a brief sample of a wailing baby after the words &quot;she and Billy Joe was throwing something off the Tallahatchie Bridge.&quot;

A 2008 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parodied the song where Kristen Wiig and host Paul Rudd play a married singer-songwriter couple who perform &quot;Ode to Tracking Number.&quot; Jill Sobule&#x27;s album &quot;California Years&quot; (2009) featured &quot;Where is Bobbie Gentry?&quot;, which used the same melody in a lyrical sequel. The narrator, seeking the reclusive Gentry, claims to be the abandoned child of Gentry and Billie Joe. In 2016, Lorrie Morgan covered the song at a slower pace for her 2016 album &quot;Letting Go... Slow&quot;. Morgan commented on recording the song with producer Richard Landis: &quot;Richard purposely slowed the record down to make the musical passages through there really feel kind of spooky and eerie. Everything just felt so swampy and scary. Everybody has their own interpretation of that song and just what they threw off of the Tallahatchie Bridge.&quot;

<text>Bizerte (, ) is a city of Bizerte Governorate in Tunisia. It is the northernmost city in Africa, located north of the capital Tunis. It is also known as the last town to remain under French control after the rest of the country won its independence from France. The city had 162,053 inhabitants in 2014.

==Names==
The classical name of Bizerte, Hippo, is the latinization of a Punic name (, ), probably related to the word &quot;ûbôn&quot;, meaning &quot;harbor&quot;. To distinguish it from Hippo Regius (the modern Annaba, in Algeria), the Greeks and Romans used several epithets. Scylax of Caryanda mentions it as and (&quot;Hippo the City&quot;). Polybius mentions it as (, &quot;Hippōn Diárrhytos&quot;), &quot;Hippo Divided-by-the-Water&quot;, in reference to the town&#x27;s prominent canal. It also appears in Roman, Vandal, and Byzantine sources as . Its Arabic name Binzart () and the French and English forms derived from it all represent phonetic developments of its ancient name.

==History==

===Later history===
Arab armies took Bizerte in 647 in their first invasion of the area, but the city reverted to control from Constantinople until the Byzantines were defeated and finally driven from North Africa in 695–98. The troops of Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire captured the city in 1535; the Turks took it in 1574. The city then became a corsair harbour and struggled against the French and the Venetians.

With its occupation of Tunisia in 1881, France gained control of Bizerte and built a large naval harbour in the city.

In 1924, after the French government officially recognized the Soviet Union (USSR), the western military fleet of White Russia that had been kept in the port of Bizerte was returned to the Soviet government. The ships were never moved from the port and finally were sold there as scrap metal.

In March 1939, towards the end of the Spanish Civil War, Spanish Republican Navy Commander Miguel Buiza ordered the evacuation of the bulk of the Republican fleet. Three cruisers, eight destroyers and two submarines left Cartagena harbor and reached Bizerte, where the French authorities impounded them.

During the Second World War, the German and Italian armies occupied Bizerte until Allied troops defeated them on 7 May 1943. During the fighting between the Allied forces and the German Army, many of the city&#x27;s inhabitants fled to the countryside or to Tunis. The city suffered significant damage during the battle.

Due to Bizerte&#x27;s strategic location on the Mediterranean, France retained control of the city and their naval base after Tunisian independence in 1956. 
In 1961 Tunisian forces blockaded the area of Bizerte and demanded French withdrawal. The face-off escalated when a French helicopter took off and drew fire. The French brought in reinforcements; when these were fired upon, France took decisive military action against the Tunisian forces. Using superior weapons and decisive force the French took Bizerte and Menzel Bourguiba. During three days in July 1961, 700 Tunisians died (1200 wounded); the French lost 24 dead (100 wounded).

Meetings at the UN Security Council and other international pressure moved France to agreement; the French military finally abandoned Bizerte on 15 October 1963.

==Geography==
===Location===
Bizerte is on a section of widened inlet and east-facing coast of the north coast of Tunisia, 15 kilometres from Ras ben Sakka (the northernmost point in Africa on the Mediterranean Sea), 20 kilometers northeast of the Ichkeul lake (a World Heritage Site), north of the archaeological site of Utica and 65 kilometers north of Tunis.

West of the city there are coastal hills forming an outcrop of the Tell Atlas with well-conserved woods and vantage points. Its associated beaches include Sidi Salem, La Grotte, Rasenjela, and Al Rimel. It is on a section of Mediterranean climate coastline, close to Sardinia and Sicily, as opposed to coasts in the south of the country which have a year-round dry desert climate.

The city is centered on the north shore of the canal of Bizerte linking the Mediterranean Sea to a tidal lake, the Lac de Bizerte which is larger than all parts of the town combined, to the immediate south. Built-up areas are in three directions:
*South-west along the widening canal with jetties at Pecherie and Jarrouba, the latter associated with Bizerte-Sidi Ahmed Air Base adjoining the opening of the lake and military/rescue heliport. 
*North are Sidi Salam and Corniche. They are within meters of the coast and on coast-facing slopes of the Ain Berda, a range of hills toward Cap Blanc, a small headland in the Ain Damou Plage natural conservation area. 
*Zarzouna, Menzel Jemil and Menzel Abderrahmane are on the south shore of the canal, formed by the locality of Zarzouna and the towns of Menzel Jemil and Menzel Abderrahmane, by a moveable bridge and both Menzels face the lake itself. The rest of the isthmus on which they stand is the gently rising Foret de Remel, reaching a high point east of its forest area at Cap Zebib.

===Transport===

The bridge leads to the motorway A4 leading to Tunis–Carthage International Airport and the capital. On the town side the P11 passes semi-rural Louata, hugs Ichkeul Lake and branches into a western route, the P7, leading directly to Tabarka on the coast next to the Algerian border. The P11 leads south-west to Béja, a governorate center, in the foothills of the Tell Atlas, forks into several roads at Bou Salem, a small town in a broad fertile plain, and climbs to Firnanah passing two high-altitude lakes and also approaching the north-west border with Algeria.

===Climate===
Bizerte enjoys a hot-summer mediterranean climate, with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The Mediterranean Sea breeze makes summers cooler and more humid than in the interior of Tunisia.

== Demography ==
In 2020 the estimated population of Bizerte was 182,662, with a density of 392.4/km2.

=== Population structure ===
In 2014 the Males represented 50.3% of the population and the Females 49.7%. 
The population aged 60 years and over represented 12.4% and the urban population represented 60.4% of the population.

=== Demographic evolution ===
== Architecture and landscape ==
=== Vieux Port ===
Le vieux port (the old port) of Bizerte is a port with its small pool surrounded by white houses, cafes and large boats in bright colors. The old port is the most charming place in Bizerte. The quay stretches in an arc along the Siena earth ramparts of the Kasbah and the low white houses. A modest boat painted in red and green slices through the calm water, a fisherman unloads his fish for the nearby market, another weighs anchor... Bizerte presents the familiar spectacle of a small Provençal or Spanish port which would have traded its bell tower for a minaret. The old port of Bizerte comes alive particularly at the end of the day, when the terraces of the bistros invade the quays.

=== Medina ===

The medina corresponds to the old town of Bizerte. It stretches north of the modern city, above Avenue Bourguiba, and runs along the old port to the Kasbah (the fortress). Once protected by a rampart facing inland, it was brought down during the French protectorate to assert its power over the city. The medina is a sort of labyrinth of narrow streets that intersect in all directions. In the souks, the smells change from one alley to another, according to the shops of craftsmen and their products. The names of the streets correspond to the old corporations present here: rue des armuriers, rue des carpenters, weavers, jewelers ... In narrow stalls you can see a craftsman at work. The tall octagonal-shaped minaret of the Great Mosque (dating from the 17th century) rises above the medina. At his side, the zaouïa of Sidi Mokhtar Dey, boss of Bizerte.

The Medina of Bizerte is an old town that surrounds the picturesque Old Port district. It is a bustling center of traditional crafts. In its winding labyrinth of narrow alleys and covered souks are the workshops of metalworkers and carpenters, and butchers and grocery stores. The streets are named after the artisans who live and work there: the blacksmiths on rue des Forgerons, the gunsmiths on rue des Armuriers, carpenters on rue des Menuisiers and butchers on rue des bouchers. It is a very atmospheric place to walk, and unlike the Medinas of Hammamet and Monastir, it has not been restored so it oozes with all the exotic charm of the Orient.

=== Kasbah ===

The Kasbah is located in north of the old port, it has a single entrance from the West side. It has small dimensions: approximately 175m by 120m and has 8 towers and a walkway. It was built in the 17th century.
On the other side of the canal, the kasbah rises its ramparts above the medina: it is accessed for the beautiful view of the city, the port, the lake and the sea. The origins of this fortress go back to the time of the Byzantine occupation: rectangular in shape, a tower occupies each corner. The entrance to the kasbah is a narrow arched passageway designed to slow down any invaders attempting to enter it at the time. The interior of the fortress is a maze of small alleys lined with houses. At the foot of the north-west rampart, the market place comes alive with the cry of the merchants, and the stalls give the impression of an organized jumble. Beyond stretches the Andalusian quarter, where the Moors from Spain took refuge in the 17th century. Further along, linked by a rampart of the kasbah, we can see the silhouette of the fort of Spain, which overlooks Bizerte at an altitude of about 40 meters on a height to the north. This fort dates from 1573, built during the Turkish domination by the Pasha of Algiers. It is built so as to be able to face the artillery, composed of thirteen sides with re-entrant angles. Now far from any threat, the fort has since been redeveloped into an open-air theater, which notably hosts the Bizerte International Festival (music, dance, film).

==Education==

Bizerte is served by the ISG (Institut Supérieur de Gestion)

==Health==

There is in Bizerte a large hospital &quot;Hôpital Régional de Bizerte&quot;, one of the biggest in the region.

==Economy==
Bizerte&#x27;s economy is very diverse. There are several military bases and year-round tourism. As a tourist centre the region is however not as popular as the eastern coast of Tunisia. There is manufacturing (textile, auto parts, cookware), fishing, fruits and vegetables, and wheat.

==Miscellaneous==

* The port of Bizerte is being developed into a significant Mediterranean yachting marina that was scheduled to open in May 2012. The superyacht section of the marina will be called Goga Superyacht Marina, and will have berths for yachts of up to 110m in length. It is expected that this will give a significant boost to the local economy as the yacht owners and also the hundreds of professional crew will become year-round consumers. The service industries supplying the yachts will gradually develop and bring additional employment.
* The actor Abdelmajid Lakhal was born in Bizerte.
* The Teapacks song &quot;Lo haya lano klum&quot; is about how bandleader Kobi Oz&#x27; family were expelled from Bizerte by the Nazis in 1942.

==Titular see==
Hippo Diarrhytus is a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1989–2002 it was held by Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, then by Jose Paala Salazar, O.P. in 2002–2004 and by Manfred Grothe since 14 October 2004. The city and see of Hippo Diarrhytus should not be confused with those of Hippo Regius where Saint Augustine of Hippo was the bishop.

== Serbian Army in Bizerte 1915–1919 ==
=== Army ===
After the Serbian army&#x27;s retreat through Albania in 1915, during World War I, part of the army was transported by the French navy to their naval base in Bizerte. Serbian soldiers, and a small number of civilians, arrived in Bizerte on three occasions. In December 1915 and early 1916, after the Albanian Golgotha, then later in 1916 after the first clashes on the Salonica front in Greece and in the early 1917 when Serbian volunteers began to gather in Bizerte. During the entire war, the soldiers were transported to the Salonica front while the wounded were transported back to Tunisia. It is estimated that over 60,000 Serbian soldiers passed through the camp. The training of the volunteers was organized in the camp, education of the disabled but also the cultural events. French-Serbian dictionary was compiled and published by Veselin Čajkanović in Bizerte. Out of 7,000 copies, 5,000 and 1,000 were distributed to Serbian and French soldiers, respectively, while the remaining 1,000 copies were sold, with money being donated to the war invalids.

Serbian wounded soldiers were originally placed in the Lambert barrack. Few days later they were relocated to the away camp Lazouaz. Almost 200 barracks were built in the camp complex. Citizens of Bizerte, French soldiers and administration were highly obliging to the Serbs, especially the Bizerte governor, admiral Émile Guépratte. He was involved in the care of the soldiers on daily basis and organized ceremonial greetings for every ship upon arrival. The last Serbian soldiers left Bizerte on 18 August 1919. Admiral Guépratte directly disobeyed the order from the French High Command by which he was ordered to dislocate Serbs into the Sahara&#x27;s hinterland. When Guépratte visited Belgrade for the first time in 1930, he was awaited by the crowd which carried the admiral on their shoulders from the Belgrade Main railway station to the Slavija Square. The street where the admiral was carried, today bears his name ()&quot;.

=== Hospitals ===

In Northern Africa, Serbian wounded soldiers were treated in the hospitals in Bizerte, Tunis, Sousse, Sidi Abdala, Algiers, Oran and Annaba. From December 1915 to August 1919, a total of 41,153 Serbian soldiers were treated. In Tunisian hospitals, 833 soldiers died (typhus, malaria, wounds, hunger and frostbites). In Sidi Abdala, local population helped the Serbs providing food, medicines and nurture. A total of 1,722 people died there.

=== Cemeteries ===
The dead in Bizerte, Sousse and Tunis were buried in the memorial ossuary on the Christian cemetery in Bizerte. Those who died in Sidi Abdala were interred on the joint French-Serbian military cemetery. Those two cemeteries are the largest of all in Northern Africa where Serbian soldiers were buried – a total of 24 cemeteries in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, with 3,005 buried soldiers.

<text>Raymond Scott Hudson (born 1959) is a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at Washington State University. Hudson was educated at Caltech, where he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering and applied science in 1985, his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering in 1986, and his PhD in electrical engineering in 1990. His research interests include radar imaging, optical signal processing, and radar astronomy.

From August 19 to 22 of 1989, Hudson and Steven Ostro observed 4769 Castalia from the Arecibo Observatory, producing the first direct image of an asteroid.

The main-belt asteroid 5723 Hudson, discovered by Edward Bowell at Lowell Observatory in 1986, was named in his honour. The official naming citation was published on 9 September 1995 ().

<doc id="522081" wikidata="Q603891" url="?curid=522081" title="Transamination">
<text>Transamination is a chemical reaction that transfers an amino group to a ketoacid to form new amino acids.This pathway is responsible for the deamination of most amino acids. This is one of the major degradation pathways which convert essential amino acids to non-essential amino acids (amino acids that can be synthesized de novo by the organism).

Transamination in biochemistry is accomplished by enzymes called transaminases or aminotransferases. α-ketoglutarate acts as the predominant amino-group acceptor and produces glutamate as the new amino acid.

:Aminoacid + α-ketoglutarate ↔ α-keto acid + glutamate

Glutamate&#x27;s amino group, in turn, is transferred to oxaloacetate in a second transamination reaction yielding aspartate.

:Glutamate + oxaloacetate ↔ α-ketoglutarate + aspartate

==Mechanism of action==

Transamination catalyzed by aminotransferase occurs in two stages. In the first step, the α amino group of an amino acid is transferred to the enzyme, producing the corresponding α-keto acid and the aminated enzyme. During the second stage, the amino group is transferred to the keto acid acceptor, forming the amino acid product while regenerating the enzyme. The chirality of an amino acid is determined during transamination. For the reaction to complete, aminotransferases require participation of aldehyde containing coenzyme, pyridoxal-5&#x27;-phosphate (PLP), a derivative of Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6). The amino group is accommodated by conversion of this coenzyme to pyridoxamine-5&#x27;-phosphate (PMP). PLP is covalently attached to the enzyme via a Schiff Base linkage formed by the condensation of its aldehyde group with the ε-amino group of an enzymatic Lys residue. The Schiff base, which is conjugated to the enzyme&#x27;s pyridinium ring, is the focus of the coenzyme activity.

:The product of transamination reactions depend on the availability of α-keto acids. The products usually are either alanine, aspartate or glutamate, since their corresponding alpha-keto acids are produced through metabolism of fuels. Being a major degradative aminoacid pathway, lysine, proline and threonine are the only three amino acids that do not always undergo transamination and rather use respective dehydrogenase.
:Alternative Mechanism
:A second type of transamination reaction can be described as a nucleophilic substitution of one amine or amide anion on an amine or ammonium salt. For example, the attack of a primary amine by a primary amide anion can be used to prepare secondary amines: 
:RNH2 + R&#x27;NH− → RR&#x27;NH + NH2− 
:Symmetric secondary amines can be prepared using Raney nickel (2RNH2 → R2NH + NH3). And finally, quaternary ammonium salts can be dealkylated using ethanolamine: 
:R4N+ + NH2CH2CH2OH → R3N + RN+H2CH2CH2OH 
:Aminonaphthalenes also undergo transaminations.[2]

==Types of aminotransferase==

Transamination is mediated by several types of aminotransferase enzymes. An aminotransferase may be specific for an individual amino acid, or it may be able to process any member of a group of similar ones, for example the branched-chain amino acids, which comprises valine, isoleucine, and leucine. The two common types of aminotransferases are alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

<text>The yellow-casqued hornbill (Ceratogymna elata), also known as the yellow-casqued wattled hornbill, is found in the rainforest of coastal regions of West Africa, for example in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. It is threatened by habitat loss.

The yellow-casqued hornbill is one of the largest birds of the West African forest, with adults weighing up to . They live mainly in the forest canopy, rarely feeding on the ground. They live in small family groups containing at least one adult male and female, with one or two immature birds, though they sometimes gather in larger flocks to exploit a major food supply such as an ant or termite nest.

The birds are occasionally preyed upon by crowned hawk-eagles, and they respond to the presence of an eagle (sometimes indicated by its characteristic shriek) by mobbing – approaching it and emitting calls. Since the eagles depend on surprise to make a catch, this frequently causes them to leave the area. Recent research (Rainey et al., 2004) has shown that the birds respond in the same way to the alarm calls that Diana monkeys, which live in the same areas, emit if they notice an eagle, and that they can distinguish the calls made by the monkeys in the presence of eagles from those they make in the presence of leopards, which prey on the monkeys but not on the hornbills.
