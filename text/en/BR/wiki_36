<text>Queer Nation is an LGBTQ activist organization founded in March 1990 in New York City, by HIV/AIDS activists from ACT UP. The four founders were outraged at the escalation of anti-gay violence on the streets and prejudice in the arts and media. The group is known for its confrontational tactics, its slogans, and the practice of outing.

== History ==
On March 20, 1990, sixty LGBTQ people gathered at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village to create a direct action organization. The goal of the unnamed organization was the elimination of homophobia, and the increase of gay, lesbian and bisexual visibility through a variety of tactics. The organization of Queer Nation, being non-hierarchical and decentralized, allowed anyone to become a member and have a voice.

The direct-action group&#x27;s inaugural action took place at Flutie&#x27;s Bar, a straight hangout at the South Street Sea Port on April 13, 1990. The goals included a desire to make it clear to (straight) patrons that queer people would not be restricted to gay bars for socializing and for public displays of affection, and to highlight their belief that most &quot;public&quot; space was in fact heterosexual space. Through parodying straight behavior (such as &quot;spin the bottle&quot;) at these events, queer people refused to be invisible while publicly questioning the naturalized status of heterosexual coupling activity. Visibility actions like this one became known as &quot;Queer Nights Out.&quot;

Another method for Queer Nation to grab attention was the use of banners at protests and rallies. One banner used read &quot;Dykes and Fags Bash Back,&quot; another &quot;Queer Nation…Get Used To It!&quot; which referenced the organization&#x27;s famous chant &quot;We&#x27;re here! We&#x27;re Queer! Get used to it!&quot;

Although the name &quot;Queer Nation&quot; had been used casually since the group&#x27;s inception, it was officially approved at the group&#x27;s general meeting on May 17, 1990.

The militant protest style of the group contrasted with more assimilationist gay rights organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign, Log Cabin Republicans, or National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. Queer Nation was most effective and powerful in the early 1990s in the US and used direct action to fight for gay rights. They also worked with AIDS organization ACT UP as well as WHAM! Even though never officially disbanded, many of the local groups did so in the mid-to-late 1990s.

The group&#x27;s use of the word &quot;queer&quot; in its name and slogan was at first considered shocking, though the reclamation has been called a success, used in relatively mainstream television programs such as &quot;Queer Eye&quot; and &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;. The use of the word &quot;queer&quot; disarmed homophobes by reversing its derogatory nature.

Other slogans used by Queer Nation include &quot;Two, Four, Six, Eight! How Do You Know Your Kids Are Straight?&quot;, &quot;Out of the Closets and Into the Streets,&quot; and the widely imitated &quot;We&#x27;re Here! We&#x27;re Queer! Get used to it!&quot;&#x27;

Queer Nation Chicago was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Activism==

At the time of Russia&#x27;s recently approved anti-gay laws, Queer Nation protested the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.

=== Early actions ===

Here are some of Queer Nation&#x27;s first actions:
* April 20, 1990
Queer Nation members show up en masse at Macy&#x27;s department store where Olympic gold medallist Greg Louganis is promoting a new swimsuit line. Queers arrive with WHEATIES cereal boxes with swimmer&#x27;s picture pasted on front, to recall the time the cereal maker rejected Louganis as a spokesperson, ostensibly because he is gay.
* April 26, 1990
Responding to the 120% increase in violence against queers, Queer Nationals climb the billboard on the roof of Badlands, a Greenwich Village bar and hangs a 40-foot banner that reads: &quot;Dykes and Fags Bash Back!&quot;
* April 28, 1990
A pipe bomb explodes in Uncle Charlie&#x27;s, a Greenwich Village gay bar, injuring three. In protest, Queer Nation mobilizes 1000 queers in a matter of hours. Angry marchers fill the streets, carrying the banner &quot;Dykes and Fags Bash Back.&quot;
* May 12, 1990
The inauguration of &quot;Queer Shopping Network.&quot; Members of Queer Nation travel from New York City to the Newport Mall in Jersey City with leaflets offering information about queers, safe sex tips, and a list of famous queers throughout history. The leaflets are titled &quot;We&#x27;re here, we&#x27;re queer and we&#x27;d like to say hello!&quot;
* June 1990

Members of Queer Nation circulate the pamphlet &quot;Queers Read This&quot; at the New York Gay Pride Parade.
* August, 1990
A boycott of the music group Snap! was arranged by members of Queer Nation after the lead singer, Turbo Harris was accused of assaulting Boston club owner, Dennis Moreau.

== Queer Nation in other locales ==
=== San Francisco ===
Queer Nation/San Francisco was founded in June 1990 by Mark Duran, Steve Mehall and Daniel Paíz; they organized a meeting at the San Francisco Women&#x27;s Building the following month where the group was launched publicly. In the fall of 1990 the group helped organize a protest against a visiting televangelist who vowed to &quot;exorcise the demons&quot; from San Francisco on Halloween. In another campaign, they distributed their trademark neon stickers that read &quot;Trans Power/BI Power/Queer Nation&quot;. The organization was active through 1991; an attempt to revive the group in 1992 was unsuccessful. An offshoot, the San Francisco Street Patrol, was a neighborhood safety patrol in the Castro District; it outlived QN/SF itself by a year.

In 1992, Transgender Nation was founded by members of Queer Nation as the &quot;first explicitly queer transgender social change group in the United States.&quot;

=== Los Angeles ===
Queer Nation LA was active in the early 90s staging protests against Hollywood&#x27;s perceived homophobia and disrupted the 64th Academy Awards by staging a &quot;kiss-in&quot;, obstructing entrants from the event while members of the group kissed on the red carpet. Other more radical actions include a blockade of Ventura Blvd, confrontations with various church groups in the area, and the taking over of a political science class at Los Angeles City College.

=== Nebraska ===
According to the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Journal-Advocate&quot;, Queer Nation Nebraska was founded in December 1990. To encourage détente between Nebraska&#x27;s lesbian and gay groups, Queer Nation Nebraska meetings were co-facilitated by one woman and one man. Queer Nation Nebraska demonstrated in front of churches and protested a show by a comedian Sam Kinison. The organization demonstrated in front of the ROTC building at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in April 1991 to protest the military&#x27;s policy of excluding LGBT people. One ROTC cadet spit on queer protesters, then punched and kicked a protester until the cadet was removed by police. Later in 1991, Queer Nation Nebraska produced a TV show consisting of two men kissing in a bathtub and pouring milk onto each other. The activists broadcast this show on Lincoln&#x27;s public access television. Angry citizens asked the Lincoln City Council to shut down the public access channel.

=== Houston ===
Queer Nation in Houston was active from the beginning of 1991 through late 1994. On July 13, 1991, the group held a major demonstration to protest police response to the July 4 gay-bashing murder of Paul Broussard; that demonstration involved between 1200 and 2000 individuals who seized the intersection of Montrose Boulevard and Westheimer Street at the heart of Houston&#x27;s gay neighborhood. Other actions by the group included a march in the suburban town that was the home of Broussard&#x27;s killers, seizing the rotunda of Houston City Hall after another murder, protesting the &quot;Houston Post&quot;″s firing of columnist Juan Palomo after he came out, and protesting discrimination against HIV-positive nurse Brian Bradley. The group also took the lead in organizing LGBT and HIV/AIDS protests at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston.

=== Denver ===
Queer Nation/Denver began in November 2012 by Todd Alan Haley II, using the original Pink Panthers Patrol insignia of the pink triangle with the &quot;clawed&quot; panther&#x27;s paw in the center. Going by the name: The Pink Panthers Movement /PPM, Haley wanted to ensure that the original message the Pink Panthers Patrol created was never lost, either by apathy or legal pressure brought on by MGM Pictures/Studios. What began with just 3 party members in June 2010, now their growth exceeds over 1200 active and supporting party members. Teaming up with various feminist groups along the US, The Pink Panthers Movement vows to remain a non-profit group dedicated to helping other LGBT non-profits and the Women&#x27;s Liberation Front. The PPM&#x27;s slogan: &quot;Our Rights, Our Community!&quot; and &quot;Curb your homophobia, we bite back!&quot;

=== Utah ===
Queer Nation Utah was founded in January 1991 by Curtis Jensen, Melanie Bailey, and Connell O&#x27;Donovan. O&#x27;Donovan went to San Francisco in December 1990 to attend Queer Nation meetings there in order to learn about the organization and gather materials and ideas to share back in Utah. The group consisted of about 100 people with a core group of about a dozen people, about half women, half men, mostly white (with some Latinx, Polynesian, and Jewish) people, and several University of Utah students and one professor. Weekly planning meetings were held as well as regular focus group sessions. One of the focus groups produced four issues of the &#x27;zine &quot;Queer Fuckers Magazine&quot; (QFM). Two major protests against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were held at their semi-annual General Conferences. Kiss-ins were held at two predominantly heterosexual venues (Denny&#x27;s diner and a Gay-owned dance club) where homophobic incidents had occurred. They were physically attacked by a large crowd outside of an Andrew Dice Clay comedy concert that Queer Nation Utah was protesting.

=== Southeast ===
The Queer Nation chapters in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbia, South Carolina; Berea and Lexington, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee founded by Kelvin Lynn Cothren and Cheryl Lynn Summerville were active in protesting known homophobic policies of the Cracker Barrel a restaurant chain in 1992.

<text>Neneh Mariann Karlsson (; born 10 March 1964), better known as Neneh Cherry, is a Swedish singer, songwriter, rapper, occasional disc jockey, and broadcaster. Her musical career started in London in the early 1980s, where she performed in a number of punk and post-punk bands in her youth, including the Slits and Rip Rig + Panic.

Cherry has released six studio albums under her own name. Her first, &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;, was released in 1989 and peaked at number two on the UK Album Chart, thanks in large part to the worldwide hit single &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot;. Her second studio album was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Homebrew&quot;. Four years later she released &quot;Man&quot;, with her next studio album, &quot;Blank Project,&quot; coming in 2014. Her most recent album, &quot;The Versions&quot;, was released in 2022. In addition to releasing these studio albums, she formed the band cirKus in 2006 and has collaborated with the Thing, releasing an album entitled &quot;The Cherry Thing&quot; in 2012. Cherry has won two Brit Awards and an MTV Europe Music Award (with Youssou N&#x27;Dour). She has also been nominated for a Grammy Award.

== Early life and family ==
Cherry was born Neneh Mariann Karlsson in Stockholm, Sweden, the daughter of Monika &quot;Moki&quot; Karlsson (1943–2009), a Swedish painter and textile artist, and the musician Ahmadu Jah (1936–2018). Jah was born in Sierra Leone, West Africa, the son of a tribal chief, and went to Stockholm to study engineering at university.

Her parents separated soon after her birth and her mother married the American jazz musician Don Cherry, who helped raise Neneh. She took her stepfather&#x27;s surname. Her half-brother, musician Eagle-Eye Cherry was born when she was four. From stepfather Don Cherry&#x27;s side, she has a stepsister, violinist Jan Cherry, and a stepbrother, jazz musician David Ornette Cherry. Through her father Ahmadu Jah&#x27;s marriage to Maylen Jah (née Bergström), Cherry is the half-sister of singer Titiyo and record producer Cherno Jah.

In 1970, Cherry&#x27;s parents, Moki and Don Cherry, bought and converted an old Swedish schoolhouse in rural Tågarp in Hässleholm. In the early 1970s, the family moved to the United States, when Don Cherry taught at Dartmouth College. In 1977 the family bought a loft in New York City in the same building as Talking Heads members Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, whom they befriended.

Cherry dropped out of school at age 14 and moved to London. At the age of 16, she was raped by a teenager while walking home at night.

==Music career==
=== Early career ===
Cherry moved to the United Kingdom when she was 15, in the midst of the punk era, and she remembers finding &quot;her people&quot; there. Cherry had met Tessa Pollitt, Viv Albertine and Ari Up from the Slits earlier as her stepfather, Don Cherry, was touring with them and took the 15-year-old Neneh along. She and Ari lived in a squat in Battersea. She felt at home, after ending up there because The Slits invited Don Cherry to go on tour with them with Prince Hammer and Creation Rebel.

In London, Cherry joined the punk rock band The Cherries. She moved through several bands, including the Slits, New Age Steppers, Rip Rig + Panic, and Float Up CP. She also DJ&#x27;d, playing early rap music on the reggae pirate Dread Broadcasting Corporation. Cherry has stated that she found her voice singing along with Poly Styrene from X-Ray Spex. She grew up in a musical family; she remembers singing with her father at the piano.

=== Albums ===
==== &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot; ====

Cherry began a solo career in 1982 with &quot;Stop the War&quot;, a protest song about the Falklands War. She worked with Jonny Dollar, the The and Cameron McVey (aka Booga Bear), who co-wrote most of her 1989 debut album &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;, and whom she later married. She was intimately involved in the Bristol Urban Culture scene, working as an arranger on Massive Attack&#x27;s &quot;Blue Lines&quot; album, through which she met Dollar. Both Robert Del Naja and Andrew Vowles of Massive Attack contributed to &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;.

The single &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; eventually peaked at number 3 in the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and number 1 on the US Dance chart. More singles released between 1988 and 1990 included &quot;Manchild&quot;, &quot;Kisses on the Wind&quot;, &quot;Heart&quot;, and &quot;Inna City Mama&quot;. She also found success with &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot;, a reworking of the Cole Porter song, which appeared on the &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; AIDS fundraising album. The single reached number 25 in the UK. Cherry was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1990 in the Best New Artist category (but lost to Milli Vanilli who eventually had their award revoked). She won a Brit Award in 1990 for &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;.

Cherry caused a press furore when she performed &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; while pregnant (with her second child, Tyson).

==== &quot;Homebrew&quot; ====

Cherry&#x27;s second album was 1992&#x27;s &quot;Homebrew&quot;. &quot;Homebrew&quot; was not as commercially successful as its predecessor. The album had some success on various &quot;Billboard&quot; charts with songs &quot;Buddy X&quot; and &quot;Trout&quot;.

&quot;Buddy X&quot; reached number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Music Charts where it spent a total of 11 weeks. The track also spent some time on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Pop Songs Charts as well as the Hot 100 Charts, where it peaked at number 22 during its 8-week run and peaked at number 43 in its 12-week run, respectively.

The music video for &quot;Buddy X&quot; earned Neneh Cherry an MTV VMA nomination at the ceremony in 1993 for the Best Female Video category, alongside Janet Jackson, Annie Lennox, and k.d. lang, with lang winning the moonman.

&quot;Trout&quot; features additional vocals by R.E.M. singer Michael Stipe who helped to co-write the track along with Cherry, McVey, and Jonathan Sharp and contains samples of a guitar riff from Steppenwolf as well as drums by John Bonham. With airplay on college radio and increased popularity, &quot;Trout&quot; spent a total of 14 weeks on &quot;Billboard&quot;′s Alternative Music Charts where it reached number 2.

&quot;Homebrew&quot; also included the work of Geoff Barrow (on &quot;Somedays&quot;), who later became part of Portishead.

Additional recognition was attributed to remixes of track &quot;Buddy X&quot;. First was the 1993 remix by The Notorious BIG, which is considered by some to be &quot;one of the great Biggie rarities in the world.&quot; Cherry stated that she and McVey picked up Biggie for the studio where they remained for the session. The song was completed in one take. &quot;Buddy X&quot; found success yet again in the 1999 UK garage remix by Dreem Teem.

&quot;Move with Me&quot; was co-written by Cherry, McVey and Lenny Kravitz.

==== &quot;Man&quot; ====
1996&#x27;s &quot;Man&quot; is a solo record produced by McVey, Jonny Dollar and Christian Falk. The lead track is &quot;Woman&quot;, her take on James Brown&#x27;s 1966 track &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s Man&#x27;s World.&quot; It featured the worldwide hit single, &quot;7 Seconds&quot;, featuring Youssou N&#x27;Dour; and &quot;Trouble Man&quot; a cover of a Marvin Gaye track. Another track, &quot;Together Now&quot;, featured Tricky.

In France, &quot;7 Seconds&quot; made number one for a record 16 weeks in 1994. The song earned Cherry her second Grammy nomination and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song. &quot;Remixes&quot;, a French remix album of &quot;Man&quot; songs, was released in 1997.

==== &quot;Blank Project&quot; ====

&quot;Blank Project&quot; was written by Cherry and her husband McVey. Paul Simm co-wrote six tracks on the record. The record was deeply influenced by the death of her mother.

To promote the album, she toured Europe in February and March 2014. In January 2015, Cherry performed as a solo artist in New York City. Cherry is very connected to New York, as she has visited or lived there off and on since 1966.

==== &quot;Broken Politics&quot; ====

&quot;Broken Politics&quot;, her second album to be produced by Four Tet, was released on 19 October 2018, and has been called &quot;quieter and more reflective&quot; than &quot;Blank Project&quot; by Cherry. The lead single, &quot;Kong&quot;, was released earlier in August. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Laura Snapes labeled the album &quot;revelatory&quot; and gave it a 5-star review.

To support the album, Cherry toured across North America, Australia and Europe in late 2018 and early 2019.

==== &quot;The Versions&quot; ====
On June 10, 2022, Cherry released her next studio album, &quot;The Versions&quot;. The album features reworked and reimagined versions of her previous singles. It features vocals from Robyn and Sia.

=== Bands/collaborations ===
The Cherry Bear Collective, Cherry&#x27;s former company with McVey, is now called Nomad Productions and is based in west London.

==== CirKus ====

In 2006, Cherry formed a new band, cirKus, with Cameron McVey, Lolita Moon (Neneh and Cameron&#x27;s daughter) and Karmil. CirKus toured Europe, with a single North American performance at the Montreal Jazz Festival in July 2006 plus a few dates in Brazil in 2008. The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Laylow&quot;, was released in France in 2006. A remixed/recorded version was released in 2007. A second CirKus album, &quot;Medicine&quot;, was released in France in March 2009.

==== &quot;The Cherry Thing&quot; ====
In March 2011, Cherry collaborated with the experimental jazz group The Thing, to release the record &quot;The Cherry Thing&quot;. The Thing is a Norwegian/Swedish jazz trio, consisting of Mats Gustafsson (saxophones), Ingebrigt Håker Flaten (double bass), and Paal Nilssen-Love (drums). The Thing took their name from the third track on stepfather Don Cherry&#x27;s album &quot;Where Is Brooklyn?&quot;. The album &quot;The Cherry Thing&quot; was released in June 2012 and was recorded at Harder Sound Studios in London, England and Atlantis Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.

During a 1 June 2012 interview with Kirsty Lang, broadcast as part of the BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Front Row&quot; daily podcast, Cherry discussed the jazz-inspired album, saying that The Thing were inspired by Cherry&#x27;s stepfather&#x27;s work, but that the band makes this inspiration their own. &quot;I think that we&#x27;re taking it on, to another place. I think that&#x27;s really important,&quot; Cherry said. One of the songs from the album, &quot;Golden Heart&quot;, was written by Don Cherry; Christer Bothén, a musician who played with Don Cherry, was invited to play on the album, and brought the song to their attention.

The album includes tracks originally performed by an eclectic mix of artists, including hip-hop artist MF Doom, Martina Topley-Bird Suicide, and The Stooges. Most of the tracks were recorded together live.

=== Other music projects ===
Although Cherry has released only a handful of albums, she has frequently collaborated with other artists.

In 1987, she was featured on the song &quot;Slow Train To Dawn&quot; by The The, in a duet with Matt Johnson. She also appeared in the music video.

In 2005, she collaborated with Gorillaz on the track &quot;Kids with Guns&quot; from the album &quot;Demon Days&quot;.

==== RocketNumberNine ====
In 2013, Cherry collaborated with London duo RocketNumberNine (named after a Sun Ra track), aka the Page Brothers – Ben and Tom Page – to record an album called &quot;MeYouWeYou&quot;. She also joined them to perform the entire album live at the Manchester International Festival in July 2013. The record is an album of 10 tracks that Cherry wrote with McVey, which they took with only vocals to RocketNumberNine, who then did their musical interpretation to all the tracks. They recorded the album live in Woodstock, New York, with Vortex. The 10 tracks were recorded in five days. Cherry calls it fearless and hardcore.

== Musical style ==
Cherry said she has never really thought of herself as a rapper. She sees herself as a &quot;singer that does a bit of rapping.&quot;

Breaking into the U.S. music industry was not a positive experience for Cherry. She said that while &quot;Buffalo Stance&quot; gave her a mainstream crossover moment in the U.S., she found the American music industry stiflingly attached to labels and genre identities.

== Other work ==
In the early 1980s, Cherry was a DJ on DBC radio, Dread Broadcasting Corporation, a pirate radio station.

Cherry appeared in a non-singing capacity in Big Audio Dynamite&#x27;s videos for &quot;Medicine Show&quot; (1985), and &quot;C&#x27;mon Every Beatbox&quot; (1986), dancing onstage with others during the band&#x27;s performance. In the late 1980s, she helped bankroll the band Massive Attack

In early 2004, Cherry presented &quot;Neneh Cherry&#x27;s World of Music&quot;, a six-part series broadcast on BBC Radio 2. In April 2007, she presented a six-part cookery show &quot;Neneh and Andi – Dish It Up&quot; with her friend Andrea Oliver for BBC Two. Neneh and Andi appeared on Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The F-Word&quot; as part of the amateur brigade.

In November 2013, Cherry contributed to the art project/audio book &quot;Ällp&quot; written by Lars Yngve. Singer Peps Persson contributed music, while Cherry, Björn Ranelid and a few other celebrities, all with their roots in Sweden&#x27;s most southern county Scania, recorded the book in Skånska/Scanian dialect (not &quot;standard Swedish&quot;, aka Rikssvenska)

In 2016 she starred in ‘’Stockholm, My Love’’ a drama film and musical film Set in Stockholm, it features music by the likes of Benny Andersson from ABBA.

&quot;Cherry&quot;, a short documentary about Neneh Cherry, was released by &quot;The Face&quot; magazine on YouTube on 23 March 2022.

In 2024 Cherry published an autobiography, &quot;A Thousand Threads&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1983, Cherry married drummer Bruce Smith and had a daughter, Naima. They divorced in 1984. Naima is a London photographer, who had a son named Louis Clyde Flynn Love (who goes by Flynn) in 2004.

In 1986, Cherry met producer and Morgan-McVey member Cameron &quot;Booga Bear&quot; McVey at Heathrow Airport. Cherry and McVey were en route to Japan as fashion models as part of London designer Ray Petri&#x27;s Buffalo Posse. Cherry proposed, and the couple married in 1990. Cherry and McVey have two daughters: singers Tyson, born in 1989 (also known as Lolita Moon), and Mabel, born in 1996. The former (who releases singles with her name stylised as TYSON) was the daughter whom Cherry was pregnant with on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1988 and is featured in the &quot;Manchild&quot; video, while the latter is the singer who has collaborated on singles with Clean Bandit, Tiësto and Joel Corry.

Cherry and Cameron McVey have a collaborative work relationship: McVey produced and co-wrote &quot;Raw Like Sushi&quot;. Together they have supported a variety of British acts and they were in the group cirKus together, with Cameron McVey known as Burt Ford and Tyson as Lolita Moon during this time. Cherry has a stepson, Marlon Roudette (former frontman of Mattafix), via McVey&#x27;s prior relationship with Vonnie Roudette.
The family has a country house near Birmingham and Wolverhampton, apartments in London and Stockholm, plus the family home in the old schoolhouse in Skåne County that she and her half-brother inherited when their mother died in 2009. In 2014, Cherry said she was commuting between London and Stockholm.

=== Style ===
Since the late 1980s, Cherry has frequently worked with the stylist and jewelry designer Judy Blame.

On her street style, Cherry cites LL Cool J as an influence, as well as the photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Judy Blame, and designer Ray Petri.
Neneh Cherry speaks English and Swedish fluently.

<text>Edwin Bradfield Liloa Chillingworth, Jr., known as Sonny Chillingworth, (July 14, 1932 – August 24, 1994) was an American guitarist and singer. Widely influential in Hawaiian music, he played slack-key guitar and is widely regarded as one of the most influential slack-key guitarists in history.

==Life==
Chillingworth was born on Oahu in the Territory of Hawaii. He started playing the guitar at age twelve when he was living with his grandfather, Harry Purdy, on Moloka&#x27;i. He learned the Hawaiian way by listening, watching and imitating. Sonny, as he was called, loved Hawaiian and Portuguese music. 

One day his father brought him a Victrola and some records. One of them was &quot;Hi&#x27;ilawe&quot; by Gabby Pahinui. Chillingworth was inspired. When Chillingworth was fifteen, he visited Honolulu and his mother arranged a meeting with Pahinui. After high school, Chillingworth moved to Honolulu and joined Pahinui, Andy Cummings and others at clubs, lu&#x27;aus and all-night jam sessions. Chillingworth was often asked to play his slack-key medleys. Many islanders and tourists enjoyed listening and watching him sing and play his guitar in the Don Ho Shows at the International Market Place in the heart of Waikiki. 

In 1954, Chillingworth made his first record, &quot;Make&#x27;e &#x27;Ailana&quot;, with the legendary Vickie Ii Rodrigues. In 1964, Chillingworth released his first album, &quot;Waimea Cowboy&quot;, which earned a gold record. In the 1970s, Chillingworth began to share his knowledge with younger performers, such as George Kuo, Ozzie Kotani, and Makana, and influenced others through his recordings. Chillingworth helped lead a revival of the slack-key guitar style in the 1980s as one of slack key&#x27;s elder statesmen. He was committed to Hawaiian music; he also played other styles such as rock-n-roll, R&amp;B, blues, and folk, and his music featured aspects of fado and cachi cachi.

Chillingworth died from cancer on August 24, 1994, in Honolulu at the age of 62.

<text>The Mekong Delta ( or simply ), also known as the Western Region () or South-western region (), is the region in southwestern Vietnam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea through a network of distributaries. The Mekong delta region encompasses a large portion of south-western Vietnam of over . The size of the area covered by water depends on the season. Its wet coastal geography makes it an important source of agriculture and aquaculture for the country.

The delta has been occupied as early as the 4th century BC. As a product of Khmer, Vietnamese, Chinese, and French settlement in the region, the delta and its waterways have numerous names, including the Khmer term Bassac to refer to the lower basin and the largest river branch flowing through it. 
After the 1954 Geneva Conference, Vietnam was split into two with South Vietnam inheriting the southern half of Vietnam becoming the State of Vietnam and eventually the Republic of Vietnam, also known as South Vietnam, with their own administrative states (see :Category:Provinces of South Vietnam). After 1975, the Mekong Delta ceased being a part of the Republic of Vietnam, succeeded by the current Vietnamese nation. Today, the region comprises 12 provinces: Long An, Đồng Tháp, Tiền Giang, An Giang, Bến Tre, Vĩnh Long, Trà Vinh, Hậu Giang, Kiên Giang, Sóc Trăng, Bạc Liêu, and Cà Mau, along with the province-level municipality of Cần Thơ.

The Mekong Delta has been dubbed a &#x27;biological treasure trove&#x27;. Over 1,000 animal species were recorded between 1997 and 2007 and new species of plants, fish, lizards, and mammals have been discovered in previously unexplored areas, including the Laotian rock rat, thought to be extinct. The low-lying coastal geography of the region makes it vulnerable to climate change caused sea level rise, alongside related issues such as coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion.

==History==
===Funan and Chenla period===

The Mekong Delta was likely inhabited long since prehistory with the civilizations of Funan and Chenla maintaining a presence in the Mekong Delta for centuries. Archaeological discoveries at Óc Eo and other Funanese sites show that the area was an important part of the Funan civilization, bustling with trading ports and canals as early as in the first century AD and extensive human settlement in the region may have gone as far back as the 4th century BC. While there is no clear consensus on the ethnic makeup of those living in the region during the Funan, archaeologists suggest that they may have had connections to Austroasiatic people. Khmer inscriptions appear during the Chenla period.

Angkor Borei is a site in the Mekong Delta that existed between 400 BC-500 AD. This site had extensive maritime trade networks throughout Southeast Asia and with India, and is believed to have possibly been the ancient capital to the civilization of Funan.

===Champa incursions===
In the early 15th century, Champa began mounting several incursions in the Mekong Delta. The declining Kingdom of Cambodia asked the Chinese Ming Empire for intervention in 1408 and 1414. Despite that, in 1421 Indravarman VI of Champa seized and annexed the eastern part of the Mekong Delta, including the marketplace town of Biên Hòa. He installed a statue of Tribhuvanākrānta (Visnu) there to mark the southern most extent of Champa. In 1757, Vietnamese lords had acquired control of Cà Mau. By the 1860s, French colonists had established control over the Mekong Delta and established the colony of French Cochinchina.

===Vietnamese period===
The Vietnamese acquisition of the Mekong Delta can be divided into two phases:

====Marriage agreement and interventions====
In 1621, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên arranged a contract marriage between his daughter Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn and Cambodian king Chey Chettha II in exchange to the establishment of a Vietnamese trade port in town of Prei Nokor (now Ho Chi Minh City) and tax exemptions for Vietnamese settlers moving into the area. Vice versa, the Nguyễn will help Cambodia politically and militarily to counter against Ayutthaya Kingdom (Siamese) pressures. Earliest Vietnamese settlements in the Mekong Delta appeared and centered around Đồng Nai and Mỗi Xoài (today Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu).

In 1658, without any excuses, the Nguyễn invaded Cambodia and deposed the only Khmer Muslim king Ramathipadi I (Sultan Ibrahim). 16 years later, the Nguyễn again militarily interfered Cambodian internal royal affairs, putting Prince Ang Nan into power. The Nguyễn invited fleeing Chinese refugees to settle in Mekong River entrance towns of Mỹ Tho and Biên Hoà In 1688, the Chinese revolted against Nguyễn lords. King Ang Nan died in 1691, and the revolt was soon resolved.

After fully subjugating Champa in 1697, the Nguyễn lords sent marquis Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh and a small expedition to annex Prei Nokor, renamed it to Gia Định, establishing Vietnamese administrative structures, and explore deep into the lower Mekong Delta from Mỹ Tho to An Giang. King Chey Chettha IV of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in 1700. In February 1700, he invaded Cambodia from An Giang. In March, the Vietnamese expedition under Cảnh and a Chinese general Trần Thượng Xuyên (Chen Shangchuan) defeated the main Cambodian army at Bích Đôi citadel, king Chey Chettha IV took flight while his nephew Ang Em surrendered to the invaders as the Vietnamese captured Phnom Penh. As a result, Saigon and Long An were officially obtained by the Nguyễn, more Vietnamese settlers moved into the new conquered lands. In 1708, Mạc Cửu of Hà Tiên also pledged loyalty to the Nguyễn lords.

====Conquest of the Mekong Delta====
In the 18th century, the edges of the Mekong Delta bordering with Cambodia had been mainly inhabited by isolated communities of Shafi&#x27;i Chams and Islamic Cham–Malays collectively known as the Cham Barw or Côn Man (Kunlun) by Vietnamese sources, while most of the Delta remained under Cambodian control. Under the reign of king Chey Chettha V, in 1750 he began subduing and persecuting the Cham–Malay Muslims, who at the time were close allies of the Nguyễn lords. Using that pretext, Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát launched a full-scale invasion of Cambodia in 1754, with the army under the command of general Nguyễn Cư Trinh. 10,000 Vietnamese troops divided into two groups, rolled into Cambodia and completely flattened Cambodian resistance and easily captured its capital Phnom Penh in summer of 1754. King Chey Chettha V fled to Longvek.

The Muslims rose up and joined the Vietnamese chasing the Cambodians. Due to heavy spring rain, the Muslim segment lost contact with the main army of Nguyễn Cư Trinh, and were surrounded by 10,000 Cambodians at Vô Tà Ân in early 1755. Muslim troops piled carts and wagons into a defensive perimeter and stood their ground against Cambodian attacks until being relieved by Nguyễn Cư Trinh. With the help of mediation by Mạc Thiên Tứ of Hà Tiên, a ceasefire agreement was reached between King Chey Chettha V and Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát in 1756: Cambodia ceded Gò Công and Tân An to the Vietnamese, Chey Chettha V was deposed, while Ang Tong was restored as King of Cambodia. Ang Tong offered the Nguyễn two districts of Trà Vinh and Ba Thắc as tributes.

In 1757, Ang Tong died and was succeeded Outey II. With the help of the Nguyễn Lords and the Principality of Hà Tiên, Outey II regained the throne from usurpers. He gave all remaining Mekong Delta lands to Mạc Thiên Tứ, and Mạc Thiên Tứ swapped all these areas to the Nguyễn in exchange for the Mạc clan&#x27;s total autonomy in Hà Tiên. The new lands were divided into two districts: Rạch Giá and Cà Mau. By 1757, all of today&#x27;s Mekong Delta including the Cape Cà Mau firmly came under Vietnamese control.

====Nguyễn dynasty, French and modern period====
In 1802 Nguyễn Ánh crowned himself emperor Gia Long and unified all the territories comprising modern Vietnam, including the Mekong Delta.

Upon the conclusion of the Cochinchina Campaign in the 1860s, the area became part of Cochinchina, France&#x27;s first colony in Vietnam, and later, part of French Indochina. Beginning during the French colonial period, the French patrolled and fought on the waterways of the Mekong Delta region with their &quot;Divisions navales d&#x27;assaut (Dinassaut)&quot;, a tactic which lasted throughout the First Indochina War, and was later employed by the US Navy Mobile Riverine Force. During the Vietnam War—also referred to as the Second Indochina War—the Delta region saw savage fighting between Viet Cong (NLF) guerrillas and the US 9th Infantry Division and units of the United States Navy&#x27;s swift boats and hovercraft (PACVs) plus the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 7th, 9th, and 21st Infantry Divisions. As a military region the Mekong Delta was encompassed by the IV Corps Tactical Zone (IV CTZ).

In 1975, North Vietnamese soldiers and Viet Cong soldiers launched a massive invasion in many parts of South Vietnam. While I, II, and III Corps collapsed significantly, IV Corps was still highly intact due to under Major General Nguyễn Khoa Nam overseeing strong military operations to prevent VC taking over any important regional districts. Brigadier General Lê Văn Hưng, the head of 21st Division commander, stayed office in Cần Thơ to continue defending successfully against VC. On 29 April 1975, the last U.S. Consul General Terry McNamara and his diplomats evacuated by marine boat from Cần Thơ to the South China Sea. When the South Vietnamese President Dương Văn Minh ordered unconditional surrender, both ARVN generals in Cần Thơ, General Lê Văn Hưng and Nguyễn Khoa Nam, committed suicide. At Binh Thuy Air Base some ARVN soldiers and air base personnel who defended the air base were evacuated by helicopters and several jet fighters to Thailand shortly after hearing Minh&#x27;s surrender. Within hours, VC soldiers occupied the base and captured those ARVN and air base personnel who didn&#x27;t escape. In Mỹ Tho, Brigadier General Trần Văn Hai, who was in charged protecting National Highway 4 (now NH1A) from Saigon to Cần Thơ, committed suicide. Tran was one of the three ARVN generals who refused to be evacuated by American forces when the North Vietnamese soldiers invaded Saigon. Several ARVN soldiers continued to fight against the VC but later either surrendered or disbanded when faced with VC counterattacks.

In the late 1970s, the Khmer Rouge regime attacked Vietnam in an attempt to reconquer the Delta region. This campaign precipitated the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and subsequent downfall of the Khmer Rouge.

==Geography==

The Mekong Delta, as a region, lies immediately to the west of Ho Chi Minh City (also called Saigon by locals), roughly forming a triangle stretching from Mỹ Tho in the east to Châu Đốc and Hà Tiên in the northwest, down to Cà Mau at the southernmost tip of Vietnam, and including the island of Phú Quốc.

The Mekong Delta region of Vietnam displays a variety of physical landscapes, but is dominated by flat flood plains in the south, with a few hills in the north and west. This diversity of terrain was largely the product of tectonic uplift and folding brought about by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates about 50 million years ago. The soil of the lower Delta consists mainly of sediment from the Mekong and its tributaries, deposited over thousands of years as the river changed its course due to the flatness of the low-lying terrain.

The present Mekong Delta system has two major distributary channels, both discharging directly into the East Sea. The river carries over 160 million tons of sediment, including 6.5 million tons of sand, each year. Historic sediment loads are estimated to be higher, but have been reduced due to damming for hydropower in the upper reaches of the Mekong River Basin, and sand mining in the riverbed. Sediment is the driving factor in building the delta seaward (progradation), and upward (aggradation) from seasonal flooding, and is counteracted by coastal erosion and sea level rise.

The Holocene history of the Mekong Delta shows delta progradation of about 200 km during the last 6 kyr. During the Middle Holocene the Mekong River was discharging waters into both the East Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. The water entering the Gulf of Thailand was flowing via a palaeochannel located within the western part of the delta; north of the Camau Peninsula.
Upper Pleistocene prodeltaic and delta front sediments interpreted as the deposits of the palaeo-Mekong River were reported from central basin of the Gulf of Thailand.

The Mekong Delta is the region with the smallest forest area in Vietnam. or 7.7% of the total area are forested as of 2011. The only provinces with large forests are Cà Mau province and Kiên Giang province, together accounting for two-thirds of the region&#x27;s forest area, while forests cover less than 5% of the area of all of the other eight provinces and cities.

===Coastal erosion===


From 1973 to 2005, the Mekong Delta&#x27;s seaward shoreline growth decreased gradually from a mean of 7.8 m/yr to 2.8 m/yr, becoming negative after 2005, with a retreat rate of −1.4 m/yr. The net deltaic land area gain has also been slowing, with the mean rate decreasing from 4.3 km2/yr (1973–1979) to 1.0 km2 yr (1995–2005), and then to −0.05 km2/yr (2005–2015). Thus, in about 2005, the subaerial Mekong Delta transitioned from a constructive mode to an erosional (or destructive) mode.

===Climate change concerns===
Being a low-lying coastal region, the Mekong Delta is particularly susceptible to floods resulting from rises in sea level due to climate change. The Climate Change Research Institute at Cần Thơ University, in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that, besides suffering from drought brought on by seasonal decrease in rainfall, many provinces in the Mekong Delta will be flooded by the year 2030. The most serious cases are predicted to be the provinces of Bến Tre and Long An, of which 51% and 49%, respectively, are expected to be flooded if the sea level rises by . Plans are currently being made to breach dykes in the upper Mekong delta, as a sedimentation enhancing strategy. This will not only increase the water retention capacity of the upper delta region, alleviating pressure on the lower delta, but also reintroduce sediment-rich water which may result in land elevation. Another problem caused by climate change is the increasing soil salinity near the coasts. Bến Tre province is planning to reforest coastal regions to counter this trend.

The duration of inundations at an important road in the city of Cần Thơ is expected to continue to rise from the current total of 72 inundated days per year to 270 days by 2030 and 365 days by 2050. This is attributed to the combined influence of sea-level rise and land subsidence, which occurs at about annually.
Several projects and initiatives on local, regional and state levels work to counter this trend and save the Mekong Delta. For example, there exists a programme for integrated coastal management that is supported by Germany and Australia. Additionally, international and local initiatives, including significant environmental funding and legislation like Resolution 120 in 2017, emphasize sustainable management and conservation of natural resources, focusing on nature-based solutions such as retrofitting dikes, mangrove restoration, and multi-value farming to mitigate environmental degradation.

In August 2019, a &quot;Nature Communications&quot; study using an improved measure of elevation estimation, found that the delta was much lower than previous estimates, only a mean above sea level, with 75% of the delta—an area where 12 million people currently live—falling below . It is expected that a majority of the delta will be below sea level by 2050.

==Demographics==

The inhabitants of the Mekong Delta region are predominantly ethnic Vietnamese. It is home to the largest population of Khmer outside of Cambodia. The Khmer minority population live primarily in the Trà Vinh, Sóc Trăng, and Muslim Chăm in Tân Châu, An Giang and Cà Mau provinces. There are also sizeable Hoa (ethnic Chinese) populations in the Kiên Giang, and Trà Vinh provinces. The region had a population of 17.33 million people in 2011.

The languages spoken in the Mekong Delta are mainly Vietnamese and Khmer which cover almost the majority of the population. Then there are also various Chinese languages spoken by the Hoa community, as well as the Cham and Mekong Delta Malay languages which are the lingua franca for the Muslim community there.

The population of the Mekong Delta has been growing relatively slowly in recent years, mainly due to out-migration. The region&#x27;s population only increased by 471,600 people between 2005 and 2011, while 166,400 people migrated out in 2011 alone. Together with the central coast regions, it has one of the slowest growing populations in the country. Population growth rates have been between 0.3% and 0.5% between 2008 and 2011, while they have been over 2% in the neighbouring southeastern region. Net migration has been negative in all of these years. The region also has a relatively low fertility rate, at 1.8 children per woman in 2010 and 2011, down from 2.0 in 2005.

==Provinces==
==Economy==

The Mekong Delta is by far Vietnam&#x27;s most productive region in agriculture and aquaculture, while its role in industry and foreign direct investment (FDI) is much smaller.

===Agriculture===
2.6 million ha in the Mekong Delta are used for agriculture, which is one fourth of Vietnam&#x27;s total. Due to its mostly flat terrain and few forested areas (except for Cà Mau province), almost two-thirds (64.5%) of the region&#x27;s land can be used for agriculture. The share of agricultural land exceeds 80% in Cần Thơ and neighbouring Hậu Giang province and is below 50% only in Cà Mau province (32%) and Bạc Liêu province (42%). The region&#x27;s land used for growing cereals makes up 47% of the national total, more than northern and central Vietnam combined. Most of this is used for rice cultivation.

Rice output in 2011 was 23,186,000t, 54.8% of Vietnam&#x27;s total output. The strongest producers are Kiên Giang province, An Giang province, and Đồng Tháp province, producing over 3 million tonnes each and almost 11 million tonnes together. Any two of these provinces produce more than the entire Red River Delta. Only three provinces produce less than 1 million tonnes of rice (Bạc Liêu province, Cà Mau province, Bến Tre province).

===Fishery===
The Mekong Delta is also Vietnam&#x27;s most important fishing region. It has almost half of Vietnam&#x27;s capacity of offshore fishing vessels (mostly in Kien Gian with almost 1/4, Bến Tre, Cà Mau, Tiền Giang, Bạc Liêu). Fishery output was at 3.168 million tons (58.3% of Vietnam) and has experienced rapid growth from 1.84mt in 2005. All of Vietnam&#x27;s largest fishery producers with over 300kt of output are in the Mekong Delta: Kiên Giang, Cà Mau, Đồng Tháp, An Giang, and Bến Tre.

Despite the region&#x27;s large offshore fishing fleet, 2/3 (2.13 million tonnes out of Vietnam&#x27;s total of 2.93) of fishery output actually comes from aquaculture.

December 2015, aquaculture production was estimated at 357 thousand tons, up 11% compared to the same period last year, bringing the total aquaculture production 3516 thousand tons in 2015, up 3.0% compared to the same period. Although aquaculture production has increased overall, aquaculture still faces many difficulties coming from export markets.

===Industry and FDI===

The Mekong Delta is not strongly industrialized, but is still the third out of seven regions in terms of industrial gross output. The region&#x27;s industry accounts for 10% of Vietnam&#x27;s total as of 2011. Almost half of the region&#x27;s industrial production is concentrated in Cần Thơ, Long An province and Cà Mau province. Cần Thơ is the economic center of the region and more industrialized than the other provinces. Long An has been the only province of the region to attract part of the manufacturing booming around Ho Chi Minh City and is seen by other provinces as an example of successful FDI attraction. Cà Mau province is home to a large industrial zone including power plants and a fertiliser factory.

Accumulated foreign direct investment in the Mekong Delta until 2011 was $10.257bn. It has been highly concentrated in a few provinces, led by Long An and Kiên Giang with over $3bn each, Tiền Giang and Cần Thơ (around 850m), Cà Mau (780m) and Hậu Giang (673m), while the other provinces have received less than 200m each. In general, the performance of the region in attracting FDI is evaluated as unsatisfactory by local analysts and policymakers. 
Companies from Ho Chi Minh City have also invested heavily in the region. Their investment from 2000 to June 2011 accounted for 199 trillion VND (almost $10bn).

==Infrastructure==

The construction of the Cần Thơ Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge over the largest distributary of the Mekong River, was completed on April 12, 2010, three years after a collapse that killed 54 and injured nearly 100 workers. The bridge replaces the ferry system that currently runs along National Route 1, and links Vĩnh Long province and Cần Thơ city. The cost of construction is estimated to be 4.842 trillion Vietnamese đồng (approximately 342.6 million United States dollars), making it the most expensive bridge in Vietnam.

==Culture==

Life in the Mekong Delta revolves much around the river, and many of the villages are often accessible by rivers and canals rather than by road.

The region is home to cải lương, a form of Kinh/Vietnamese folk opera. Cai Luong Singing appeared in Mekong Delta in the early 20th century. Cai Luong Singing is often performed to the accompaniment of guitar and zither. Cai Luong is a kind of play telling a story. This often includes two main parts: the dialogue part and the singing part to express their thoughts and emotions.

===Cuisine===
The Mekong Delta cuisine relies heavily on fresh products which is abundant in the new land with heavy use of seafoods and unique ingredients of the region such as palm sugar, basa fish and wild herbs and flowers such as điên điển, so đũa, kèo nèo. The history of the region being a newly settled area reflects on its cuisine, with &quot;Ẩm thực khẩn hoang&quot; or &quot;Settlers cuisine&quot; means dishes are prepared fresh from wild and newly-caught ingredients. The cuisine is also influenced by Khmer, Cham and Chinese settlers. This differs itself from the cuisine of other regions of Vietnam.

===Literature and movies===
Nguyễn Ngọc Tư, an author from Cà Mau province, has written many popular books about life in the Mekong Delta such as:

*Ngọn đèn không tắt (The Inextinguishable Light, 2000)
*Ông ngoại (Grandpa, 2001)
*Biển người mênh mông (The Ocean of People, 2003)
*Giao thừa (New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2003)
*Nước chảy mây trôi (Flowing Waters, Flying Clouds, 2004)
*Cánh đồng bất tận (The Endless Field, 2005)

The 2004 film &quot;The Buffalo Boy&quot; is set in Cà Mau province.

Some Vietnamese films on the topic of life in the Mekong Delta attract the attention of a large audience: Tình Mẫu Tử (Mother and child love, 2019), Phận làm dâu (Bride&#x27;s fate, 2018), etc.

<text>Shibataea is a genus of Chinese bamboos in the grass family.

They are unique shorter bamboos with dark green leaves. This genus is more closely related to the genus &quot;Phyllostachys&quot; than other small bamboos. Excellent as tall groundcover or short hedges, they are especially suited to climates similar to the Pacific Northwest since they dislike dry climates. They not do well with alkaline or water-logged soil. They need acidic conditions to prevent leaf burn. They are sometimes called ruscus-leaved bamboo, as the shape of the leaves resembles that of the genus &quot;Ruscus&quot;. These bamboos are very resistant to bamboo mites. They are used to make canes.

<doc id="518542" wikidata="Q1088473" url="?curid=518542" title="The Blueprint">
<text>The Blueprint is the sixth studio album by American rapper Jay-Z, released on September 11, 2001, through Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. Its release was set a week earlier than initially planned in order to combat bootlegging. Recording sessions for the album took place during 2001 at Manhattan Center Studios and Baseline Studios in New York City. Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z&#x27;s previous work, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West, Just Blaze, and Bink, as well as Timbaland, Trackmasters, and Eminem, who also contributes the album&#x27;s sole guest feature.

At the time of the album&#x27;s recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop&#x27;s most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss. The album is also notable for both its producers Kanye West and Just Blaze&#x27;s breakouts as major producers. West produced four of the thirteen tracks on the album, including the songs &quot;Izzo (H.O.V.A.)&quot; and the controversial &quot;Takeover&quot;, which included diss lyrics aimed at rappers Nas and Prodigy, while Just Blaze produced three tracks, &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls&quot;, &quot;Song Cry&quot;, &quot;U Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, and hidden bonus track &quot;Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)&quot;.

&quot;The Blueprint&quot; was universally acclaimed by music critics, particularly for Jay-Z&#x27;s performance and the album&#x27;s soul-based soundscape. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time as well as one of the greatest albums ever made in general. Despite its release coinciding with the September 11 attacks, it sold over 427,000 copies in its opening week and debuted at number one in the US, holding the spot for three weeks. It was later certified 3× Multi-Platinum by the RIAA. In 2018, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant,&quot; becoming the first entry created in the 21st century.

== Background ==
&quot;The Blueprint&quot; was reportedly cut in two weeks, with Jay-Z recording nine songs in two days. At the time, he was awaiting two criminal trials for gun possession and assault. He was also engaged in feuds with various rappers such as Jadakiss, Fat Joe and in particular Nas and Mobb Deep member Prodigy. In the song &quot;Takeover&quot;, Jay-Z attacks the two Queensbridge rappers, using a sample of the song &quot;Five to One&quot; by The Doors and an interpolation of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Fame&quot;. On &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, Jay-Z and his producers used vintage soul as inspiration, including a vocal sample on almost every track from such artists as Al Green, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, David Ruffin and The Jackson 5. Exceptions include &quot;Jigga That Nigga&quot;, &quot;Hola Hovito&quot;, and &quot;Renegade&quot;, a track produced by and featuring the rapper Eminem, and the only track on the album featuring another rapper on verses.

== &quot;Blueprint&quot; Lounge Tour ==
In late August, Jay-Z announced a September–October tour in small venues. Because of the September 11 attacks occurring on the same day the album was released, the first two performances were rescheduled. Chicago, San Francisco, and Los Angeles were subsequently added, and Jay-Z donated to relief organizations one dollar of the cost of each ticket sold for the tour.

== Cover ==
The photograph on the album&#x27;s cover, taken by Jonathan Mannion, was inspired by one from &quot;The Firm&quot;, a series by Jocelyn Bain Hogg depicting organized crime in Britain. Instead of the telephone and brass knuckles seen next to the ashtray in the original picture, a cigar, a pack of cigars and a microphone were placed.

== Reception and impact ==

&quot;The Blueprint&quot; received universal acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 12 reviews. Upon its release, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; was hailed by &quot;Vibe&quot;″s dream hampton as Jay-Z&#x27;s best album, as well as the best album of the year, while &quot;The Source&quot; awarded &quot;The Blueprint&quot; a perfect &quot;five-mic&quot; rating, a distinction reserved for hip hop classics. In his review for &quot;The Source&quot;, Carlito Rodriguez described &quot;The Blueprint&quot; as &quot; defining moment of Jay-Z&#x27;s career&quot;, commending his ability to convey emotions through his lyrics. Nathan Rabin called it Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;strongest, tightest, most consistent album since his legendary debut, 1996&#x27;s &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;.&quot;

The popularity and commercial success of &quot;The Blueprint&quot; established Kanye West and Just Blaze as two of hip hop&#x27;s most celebrated producers. West in particular would later be signed by Roc-A-Fella Records in 2002. Both West and Just Blaze would go on to have successful music careers. Furthermore, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; signaled a major stylistic shift in hip hop production towards a more Soulcentric and sample-reliant sound, creating a number of imitators who attempted to emulate the album&#x27;s atmospheric style. Prior to &quot;The Blueprint&quot;, mainstream hip-hop producers had largely eschewed music sampling in favor of the keyboard-driven &quot;Timbaland sound&quot; (characterized by a shifting, syncopated rhythm, similar to samba or jungle music), due to the financial and legal issues associated with copyright laws.

&quot;The Blueprint&quot;, however, revived musical sampling as a common practice in hip hop music and dislodged the digital keyboard-driven production style as the dominant sound in hip-hop music. West would later incorporate some of the production and sampling techniques he used on this album into his own solo albums. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;One of the greatest poets ever to pick up a mic released his magnum opus in 2001. One retirement and one un-retirement later, it&#x27;s still his finest hour.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; was ranked number 464 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time; in a revised list in 2012, it was ranked number 252; in the 2020 revised list, the album was ranked number 50. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; named &quot;The Blueprint&quot; the second best album of 2000–2004, and in 2010, it ranked fifth on their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list. It is ranked at number 4 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the 2000s&quot;. The album received a perfect &quot;XXL&quot; rating from &quot;XXL&quot; magazine in a 2007 retrospective article. &quot;The Blueprint&quot; was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

=== Bonus tracks ===
As with &quot;Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter&quot;, Jay-Z put two hidden bonus tracks at the end of the final track. &quot;Blueprint (Momma Loves Me)&quot; is 3:41 by itself. Twenty-five seconds of silence follows after and the bonus track &quot;Breathe Easy (Lyrical Exercise)&quot; begins. That song fades and is immediately followed by &quot;Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2)&quot;. It is reported that the latter song features uncredited vocals by Michael Jackson. The final track as a whole is 12:07. On the iTunes Store, however, these bonus tracks are released as separate tracks, thus making the album 15 tracks long. On the vinyl edition, there are no long gaps between the songs, but they are not printed on the back of the album jacket or record label.

<text>John Scott Russell (9 May 1808, Parkhead, Glasgow – 8 June 1882, Ventnor, Isle of Wight) was a Scottish civil engineer, naval architect and shipbuilder who built &quot;Great Eastern&quot; in collaboration with Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He made the discovery of the wave of translation that gave birth to the modern study of solitons, and developed the wave-line system of ship construction.

Russell was a promoter of the Great Exhibition of 1851.

==Early life==
John Russell was born on the 9th May 1808 with in Parkhead, Glasgow, the son of Reverend David Russell and Agnes Clark Scott. He spent one year at the University of St. Andrews before transferring to the University of Glasgow. It was while at the University of Glasgow that he added his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Scott, to his own, to become John Scott Russell. He graduated from Glasgow University in 1825 at the age of 17 and moved to Edinburgh where he taught mathematics and science at the Leith Mechanics&#x27; Institute, achieving the highest attendance in the city.

On the death of Sir John Leslie, Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh in 1832, Scott Russell, though only 24 years old, was elected to temporarily fill the vacancy pending the election of a permanent professor, due to his proficiency in the natural sciences and popularity as a lecturer. But although encouraged to stand for the permanent position he refused to compete with another candidate he admired and thereafter concentrated the engineering profession and experimental research on a large scale.

==Family life==
He married Harriette Osborne, daughter of the Irish baronet Sir Daniel Toler Osborne and Harriette Trench, daughter of the Earl of Clancarty in Dublin in 1839; they had two sons (Norman survived) and three daughters, Louise (1841–1878), Rachel (1845–1882) and Alice. In London they lived for five years in a house provided for the secretary of the Society of Arts and then moved to Sydenham Hill, which became a centre of attention especially after Russell and his friends moved Paxton&#x27;s glasshouse for the Great Exhibition to the Crystal Palace close by.

Arthur Sullivan and his friend Frederic Clay were frequent visitors at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s; Clay became engaged to Alice, and Sullivan wooed Rachel. While Clay was from a wealthy family, Sullivan was still a poor young composer from a poor family; the Scott Russells welcomed the engagement of Alice to Clay, who, however broke it off, but forbade the relationship between Sullivan and Rachel, although the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.

The American engineer Alexander Lyman Holley befriended Scott Russell and his family on his various visits to London at the time of the construction of &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Holley also visited Scott Russell&#x27;s house in Sydenham. As a result of this, Holley, and his colleague Zerah Colburn, travelled on the maiden voyage of &quot;Great Eastern&quot; from Southampton to New York in June 1860. Scott Russell&#x27;s son, Norman, stayed with Holley at his house in Brooklyn — Norman also travelled on the maiden voyage, one voyage that John Scott Russell did not make.

His son, Norman, followed his father in becoming a naval architect, contributing to the Institution of Naval Architects which his father had founded.

==Steam carriage==
While in Edinburgh he experimented with steam engines, using a square boiler for which he developed a method of staying the surface of the boiler which became universal. The &quot;Scottish Steam Carriage Company&quot; was formed producing a steam carriage with two cylinders developing 12 horsepower each. Six were constructed in 1834, well-sprung and fitted out to high standard, which from March 1834 ran between Glasgow&#x27;s George Square and the Tontine Hotel in Paisley at hourly intervals at 15 mph. The road trustees objected that it wore out the road and placed various obstructions of logs and stones in the road, which actually caused more discomfort for horse-drawn carriages. But in July 1834 one of the carriages was overturned and the boiler smashed, causing the death of several passengers. Two of the coaches were sent to London where they ran for a short time between London and Greenwich.

== The wave of translation ==

In 1834, while conducting experiments to determine the most efficient design for canal boats, he discovered a phenomenon that he described as the wave of translation. In fluid dynamics the wave is now called Russell&#x27;s solitary wave. The discovery is described here in his own words:

I was observing the motion of a boat which was rapidly drawn along a narrow channel by a pair of horses, when the boat suddenly stopped—not so the mass of water in the channel which it had put in motion; it accumulated round the prow of the vessel in a state of violent agitation, then suddenly leaving it behind, rolled forward with great velocity, assuming the form of a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well-defined heap of water, which continued its course along the channel apparently without change of form or diminution of speed. I followed it on horseback, and overtook it still rolling on at a rate of some eight or nine miles an hour [14 km/h], preserving its original figure some thirty feet [9 m] long and a foot to a foot and a half [30−45 cm] in height. Its height gradually diminished, and after a chase of one or two miles [2–3 km] I lost it in the windings of the channel. Such, in the month of August 1834, was my first chance interview with that singular and beautiful phenomenon which I have called the Wave of Translation.

The phenomenon of solitary waves had previously been reported in 1826 by Giorgio Bidone in Turin, but Bidone&#x27;s work seems to have gone unnoticed by researchers in the Netherlands and Britain, despite being mentioned in the Edinburgh Journal of Science in the same year. 

Scott Russell spent some time making practical and theoretical investigations of these waves. He built wave tanks at his home and noticed some key properties:
* The waves are stable, and can travel over very large distances (normal waves would tend to either flatten out, or steepen and topple over)
* The speed depends on the size of the wave, and its width on the depth of water.
* Unlike normal waves they will never merge—so a small wave is overtaken by a large one, rather than the two combining.
* If a wave is too big for the depth of water, it splits into two, one big and one small.
Scott Russell&#x27;s experimental work seemed at contrast with Isaac Newton&#x27;s and Daniel Bernoulli&#x27;s theories of hydrodynamics. George Biddell Airy and George Gabriel Stokes had difficulty to accept Scott Russell&#x27;s experimental observations because Scott Russell&#x27;s observations could not be explained by the existing water-wave theories. Additional observations were reported by Henry Bazin in 1862 after experiments carried out in the canal de Bourgogne in France. In 1863, Bazin authored a research paper titled &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;Hydraulic Researches Undertaken by M.H. Darcy&quot;) which featured the work of Scott Russell. 

A Dutch translation of Bazin&#x27;s work entitled &#x27; (English: &quot;Report to the French Academy of Sciences on the portion of Bazin&#x27;s treatise relating to surges and the propagation of waves&quot;) was featured in the proceedings of the Dutch &#x27; (English: &quot;Royal Institute of Engineers&quot;) in 1869. Within the original French paper, and the translated work, the velocity of a solitary wave is given as: 

formula_1

The formula is denoted as &quot;the law of Scott Russell&quot; within the text. His contemporaries spent some time attempting to extend the theory but it would take until the 1870s before an explanation was provided.

Lord Rayleigh published a paper in Philosophical Magazine in 1876 to support John Scott Russell&#x27;s experimental observation with his mathematical theory. In his 1876 paper, Lord Rayleigh mentioned Scott Russell&#x27;s name and also admitted that the first theoretical treatment was by Joseph Valentin Boussinesq in 1871; Boussinesq had mentioned Scott Russell&#x27;s name in his 1871 paper. Thus Scott Russell&#x27;s observations on solitary waves were accepted as true by some prominent scientists within his own lifetime.

Korteweg and de Vries did not mention John Scott Russell&#x27;s name at all in their 1895 paper but they did quote Boussinesq&#x27;s paper in 1871 and Lord Rayleigh&#x27;s paper in 1876. Although the paper by Korteweg and de Vries in 1895 was not the first theoretical treatment of this subject, it was a very important milestone in the history of the development of soliton theory.

It was not until the 1960s and the advent of modern computers that the significance of Scott Russell&#x27;s discovery in physics, electronics, biology and especially fibre optics started to become understood, leading to the modern general theory of solitons.

Note that solitons are, by definition, unaltered in shape and speed by a collision with other solitons. So solitary waves on a water surface are not solitons – after the interaction of two (colliding or overtaking) solitary waves, they have changed slightly in amplitude and an oscillatory residual is left behind.

==Wave line system==

Once Russell had a way of observing boats at hitherto unprecedented speeds at the front of his wave of translation, he tackled the more fundamental issue for boat design of finding the hull shape which gives the least resistance. This, he reasoned was concerned with moving the mass of water efficiently out of the way of the hull and then back to fill the gap after it has passed. By careful measurements with dynamometers he validated his theory that a versed sine wave produces the ideal shape.

Initially he thought that the stern could be a mirror of the stem, but soon realised that the removing water produced something closer to conventional waves than his solitary waves and ended up with a rounded stern with a catenary shape.

His studies produced a revolution in the design of hulls for merchant and navy vessels. Most ships of the time had rounded bows to optimise the cargo-carrying capacity, but starting from the 1840s the &quot;extreme clipper ships&quot; started to show concave bows as increasingly did steam ships culminating with &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. After his views were propounded by Commander Fishbourne, the American naval architect John W. Griffiths acknowledged the force of Russell&#x27;s work in his &quot;Treatise on marine and naval architecture&quot; of 1850 though he was grudging in acknowledging a debt to Russell.

==Doppler effect==
Scott Russell made one of the first experimental observations

of the Doppler effect which he published in 1848. Christian Doppler published his theory in 1842.

==Professional association==
Much of Russell&#x27;s early experimental work had been conducted under the auspices of the British Association and throughout his life he contributed to the scientific and professional associations that were becoming more important in that era.

In 1844, the railway boom was at its height. Russell had contributed an article on the Steam engine and steam navigation for the 7th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica in 1841 which also appeared in book form. Charles Wentworth Dilke offered him the editorial position of a new weekly paper, the &quot;Railway Chronicle&quot; in London and the Russell family was soon in a small two-room flat in Westminster. The next year he also became the secretary of the committee set up by the Royal Society of Arts to organise a national exhibition, which provided them with a town house in the Strand. Russell soon introduced Henry Cole to the committee and when, a few weeks before the first exhibition in 1847, there were no exhibitors, Russell and Cole spent three whole days travelling around London to enlist manufacturers and shopkeepers. This and two subsequent exhibitions were such a success that an international version was planned for 1851. By this time Russell had once again started shipbuilding, the railway boom having finished, and although he became the RSA&#x27;s appointed secretary for the Great Exhibition, Henry Cole was by this time taking the lead, and he ended up with only a Gold Medal as his reward for much work.

Russell became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1847 attending regularly and making frequent contributions, was elected to its council in 1857 and became a vice-president in 1862. However he became involved in a financial dispute with Sir William Armstrong and didn&#x27;t become president. But &quot;as a speaker, and particularly as an after-dinner speaker, he had few equals.&quot; He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849 although he contributed less.

In 1860 at a meeting at his house in Sydenham, the Institution of Naval Architects was set up, with Russell as one of the professional vice-presidents. He attended most meetings and rarely failed to comment. In 1864 he published a massive 3-volume treatise on &quot;The Modern System of Naval Architecture&quot; which laid out the profiles of many of the new ships being built.

His obituary said of naval architecture:
:&quot;it may be said that on commencing his career he found it the most empirical of arts, and he left it one of the most exact of engineering sciences. To this great result many others contributed largely besides himself; but his personal investigations, and the theories which he deduced from them, gave the first impetus to scientific naval architecture&quot;.

== Ship building ==

From around 1838, Scott Russell was employed at the small Greenock shipyard of Thomson and Spiers where he introduced his wave-line system to a series of Royal Mail ships, together with many other innovations. After the shipyard was taken over by Caird, he decided to move to London and in 1848 purchased the Millwall Iron Works shipbuilding company. He built two ships for Brunel for the Australia run, much the same size as Brunel&#x27;s SS Great Britain, &quot;Adelaide&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;. Problems with refuelling and water led Brunel to think in terms of larger ships for this voyage, but five more were built in the same class.

Before they started any business together, he was held in high regard by Isambard Kingdom Brunel who made him a partner in his project to build &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Although the original conception, the cellular construction and the joint use of paddle and screw were Brunel&#x27;s ideas, &quot;the ship embodies the wave-line form, the longitudinal system of construction, the complete and partial bulkheads, and other details of construction which were peculiarly Scott Russell’s&quot;. The project was plagued with a number of problems—Scott Russell put in a bid which was far too low with the result that he was bankrupt halfway through, though he recovered to finish the job; but it was Brunel that insisted on a sideways launch rather than the dry dock that Russell preferred. &quot;Great Eastern&quot; was eventually launched in 1858. Scott Russell was a better scientist than a businessman and his reputation never fully recovered from his financial irregularities, gross neglect of duty and disputes. As L. T. C. Rolt writes in his biography of Brunel &quot;That Russell had indeed misled Brunel and betrayed his trust was now becoming the more lamentably apparent with every day that passed&quot;.

During the 1850s he argued within the Navy for the construction of iron warships and the first design, , is said by some to be a &quot;Russell ship&quot;. He afterwards complained about the secrecy that prevented an open discussion of the issues, criticizing those within the Navy who argued that iron ships could not be protected.

At a time when all previous train ferries were riverine vessels, in 1868 Scott Russell designed a train ferry for service on Lake Constance, the &quot;Bodensee Trajekt&quot;, which entered service in 1869. This was the world&#x27;s first cross-lake train ferry. The &quot;Bodensee Trajekt&quot; had to meet the unusual requirement that its draft not exceed six feet (1.85m). He achieved this by using the superstructure to carry the stresses of the train. (It was not until 1892 that the first Lake Michigan cross-lake train ferry, the &quot;Ann Arbor No. 1&quot;, designed by Frank E. Kirby, entered service.) Scott Russell used the design of the &quot;Bodensee Trajekt&quot; as the basis of a cross-channel ferry that could manage the shallow harbour of Dover, but this was not realised until 1933.

==The Vienna Rotunda==

Although his design for the Great Exhibition was trumped by that of Joseph Paxton, Scott Russell did design the Rotunde for the 1873 Vienna Exposition. At in diameter it was for nearly a century the largest cupola in the world, having no ties to obstruct the view. Some consider it his greatest structural engineering achievement.
==Honours and awards==

In 1838 he was awarded the gold Keith Medal by the Royal Society of Edinburgh for his paper &quot;On the Laws by which water opposes Resistance to the Motion of Floating Bodies&quot;.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1849 for &quot;Memoirs on &quot;The great Solitary Wave of the First Order, or the Wave of Translation&quot; published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and of several Memoirs in the Reports of the British Association&quot;.

In 1995, the aqueduct which carries the Union Canal – the same canal where he observed his Wave of Translation – over the Edinburgh Bypass (A720) was named the Scott Russell Aqueduct in his memory. Also in 1995, the hydrodynamic soliton effect was reproduced near the place where John Scott Russell observed hydrodynamic solitons in 1834.

A building at Heriot-Watt University is named after him.

In 2019 he was inducted into the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame

His 1844 paper has become a classical paper and is quite frequently cited in soliton-related papers or books even after more than one hundred and fifty years.

<doc id="518548" wikidata="Q38790" url="?curid=518548" title="Smooth Collie">
<text>The Smooth Collie is a breed of dog developed originally for herding. It is a short-coated version of the Rough Collie of Lassie fame. Some breed organisations consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed.

==History==

The early history of the Smooth Collie, like that of many dog breeds, is a matter of speculation. Even the origin of the breed&#x27;s name is unclear, variously claimed to describe the early shepherd dog&#x27;s dark colour (&quot;coaly&quot;) or derived from the name of a breed of sheep with black faces once commonly kept in Scotland (&quot;Colley&quot;) or derived from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning &quot;useful.&quot; The word could also trace to Gaelic or/and Irish - in which the words for &quot;doggie&quot; are, respectively, &quot;càilean&quot; and &quot;coileán&quot;. This would be more consistent with the breed&#x27;s origin in the Gaelic-speaking Scottish Highlands than an Anglo-Saxon term.

The modern history of both the Smooth and Rough Collie began in the reign of Queen Victoria, who became interested in the shepherds&#x27; dogs while at Balmoral Castle in Scotland. In 1860, she purchased some of the dogs for her own kennel. With the Queen&#x27;s interest, it became fashionable to own Smooth Collies. Thus began the breed&#x27;s transformation from working farm dog, similar to the modern Border collie, to the dog bred as a pet and for the sport of conformation showing that we know today.

The Smooth Collie today is considered a variety of the same breed as the Rough Collie in the United States, Canada, meaning that they can interbreed and some statistics are kept only for &quot;Collie&quot; rather than for both varieties individually. The smooth and rough are classified as separate breeds in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, and Australia. The latter is a fairly recent development, however, with the Kennel Club (UK) allowing the interbreeding of the two varieties until 1993.

A breed society, the Smooth Collie Club of Great Britain, was established in 1955. The breed was definitively accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1974. 

== Characteristics ==

The Smooth Collie is of medium to large size: dogs stand some at the withers, bitches about less; weights are in the range for bitches and about for dogs.

It is slightly longer than it is tall, with a level back and a deep chest. The features of the head, particularly the &quot;sweet&quot; expression, are considered very important in the show ring. The breed has a long muzzle, flat skull, and semi-erect ears.

The outer coat is flat, short and harsh-textured, the undercoat soft and dense. Three coat colours are recognised: sable (sand-colour, ranging from pale gold to rich mahogany); tricolour (mostly black, with tan and white markings); and blue merle (silvery grey marbled with black, with or without tan markings), all marked with white areas on the chest, neck, feet, legs and tip of the tail.
==Temperament==

The Smooth Collie is generally a sociable, easily trained family dog. Although not an aggressive breed, they are alert and vocal, making them both good watchdogs if well trained and potential nuisances if allowed to bark indiscriminately. Collies are agile and active dogs and need regular exercise in some way. This breed is easy to train, due to its high intelligence and eagerness to please its owners. Training this breed requires a light touch, as they are sensitive to correction and shy away from harsh treatment. They get along well with children and other animals, usually getting along with other dogs. Smooth Collies are used both as family pets and in obedience competition, agility, herding trials, and other dog sports. Some are still used as working sheepdogs. They are also very useful as assistance dogs for the disabled.

==Health==
*Progressive retinal atrophy: Gradual degeneration of the retinas of the eyes, eventually leading to blindness. This disease is less common than CEA in Collies, but more difficult to breed away from, as symptoms are not usually detectable until the affected dog is middle-aged or older.
*Multidrug sensitivity (MDR1): Sometimes fatal reactions to a class of common drugs, particularly ivermectin, used as a heartworm preventative and treatment for mites. The gene that causes this sensitivity has recently been identified, and a dog&#x27;s susceptibility can now be determined through a simple blood test.
*Gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat): A painful and often fatal twisting of the stomach occurring in large or deep-chested breeds which can usually be prevented by feeding small meals and not allowing vigorous exercise immediately before or after eating.
*Epilepsy: Seizures of unknown origin. Frequency of the seizures can often be significantly reduced through medication, but there is no cure for this disease.
*Cyclic Neutropenia: CN is also known as Gray Collie Syndrome. Cyclic Neutropenia is a disease that affects the neutrophils of a dog, which are an integral part of the dog&#x27;s immune system. Most affected dogs will die as puppies, and even with the best care, the dog will not likely live past 2–3 years of age.
Collie eye anomaly is an autosomal recessive condition caused by a mutation in the NHEJ1 gene that affects Collies and related breeds.

== Work and sports ==
Smooth Collies can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, search and rescue (SAR), assistance dog and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.

<text>The Festival international de Jazz de Montréal is an annual jazz festival held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Montreal Jazz Fest holds the 2004 Guinness World Record as the world&#x27;s largest jazz festival. Every year it features roughly 3,000 artists from 30-odd countries, more than 650 concerts (including 450 free outdoor performances), and welcomes over 2 million visitors (12.5% of whom are tourists) as well as 300 accredited journalists. The festival takes place at 20 different stages, which include free outdoor stages and indoor concert halls.

A major part of the city&#x27;s downtown core is closed to traffic for ten days, as free outdoor shows are open to the public and held on many stages at the same time, from noon until midnight. The &quot;festival&#x27;s Big Event concerts typically draw between 100,000 and 150,000 people&quot;, and can occasionally exceed 200,000. Shows are held in a wide variety of venues, from relatively small jazz clubs to the large concert halls of Place des Arts. Some of the outdoor shows are held on the cordoned-off streets, while others are in terraced parks.

== History ==
Rouè-Doudou Boicel founded the Rising Sun Festijazz, Montreal&#x27;s first blues &amp; jazz festival in 1978. There were also other previous jazz festivals in Montreal, including the 3-day Jazz de Chez Nous festival in 1979, created by Montreal bassist Charlie Biddle.

The Montreal Jazz Festival (later: Montreal International Jazz Festival) was conceived by Alain Simard, who had spent much of the 1970s working with Productions Kosmos bringing artists such as Chuck Berry, Dave Brubeck, Chick Corea, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and others to Montreal to perform. In 1977, Simard teamed up with André Ménard and Denyse McCann to form an agency named &quot;Spectra Scène&quot; (now known as &quot;L&#x27;Équipe Spectra&quot;), with the idea of creating a summer festival in Montreal that would bring a number of artists together at the same time.

They planned their first festival for the summer of 1979. Unable to secure sufficient funding, their plans were scuttled, but they still were able to produce two nights of shows at Théâtre-St-Denis featuring Keith Jarrett and Pat Metheny.

Starting on May 10, 1980, a Montreal Jazz Festival was staged, with funding from Alain de Grosbois of CBC Stereo and Radio-Québec. With Gary Burton, Ray Charles, Chick Corea, and Vic Vogel on the bill, and an attendance of 12,000, the event was deemed a success and has continued to grow since then.

In 2000, the Festival teamed up with Distribution Select to release its 4-CD box set called &quot;Over 20 years of music – Plus de 20 ans de musique&quot;. The box includes a 13-page booklet with the artists&#x27; biographies and complete liner notes about the music.

In 1999, a group of Montreal jazz musicians disenchanted with the Montreal International Jazz Festival&#x27;s lack of support for and showcasing of Montreal jazz musicians created an alternative festival called L&#x27;OFF Festival de Jazz de Montreal. The alternative festival continues as an annual, week-long jazz festival in Montreal, programmed largely by musicians.

In 2020, for the first time in its 40-year history the International Montreal Jazz Festival was cancelled, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in what would have been its 41st edition. In 2021, because of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, the 41st edition was postponed until autumn, reduced to 5 days, and limited to outdoor performances, while indoor shows were held in 2022.

<doc id="518562" wikidata="Q312967" url="?curid=518562" title="Guru Gobind Singh">
<text>Guru Gobind Singh (; born Gobind Das; 22 December 1666 – 7 October 1708) was the tenth and last Sikh Guru. He was a warrior, poet, and philosopher. In 1675, at the age of nine he was formally installed as the leader of the Sikhs after his father Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed by Emperor Aurangzeb. His father was the ninth Sikh Guru. His four biological sons died during his lifetime – two in battle and two executed by the Mughal governor Wazir Khan.

Among his notable contributions to Sikhism are founding the &quot;Sikh&quot; warrior community called &quot;Khalsa&quot; in 1699 and introducing &quot;the Five Ks&quot;, the five articles of faith that Khalsa Sikhs wear at all times. Guru Gobind Singh is credited with the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; whose hymns are a sacred part of Sikh prayers and Khalsa rituals. He is also credited as the one who finalized and enshrined the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; as Sikhism&#x27;s primary holy religious scripture and the eternal Guru. He also established the concept of &quot;Guru Panth&quot; as his spiritual successor, however this manner of guruship is seldom evoked today.

==Family and early life==

Gobind Singh was the only son of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, and Mata Gujri. He was born into the Sodhi clan of the Punjabi Khatri community. He was born in Patna, Bihar on 22 December 1666 while his father was visiting Bengal and Assam. According to Desi Calendar, his birth date is Seven days after the New Moon Day in the Lunar Month of Poh (also called Poh Sudi 7 ਪੰਜਾਬੀ- ਪੋਹ ਸੁਦੀ ੭). His birth name was Gobind Das and a shrine named Takht Sri Patna Harimandar Sahib marks the site of the house where he was born and spent the first four years of his life. In 1670, his family returned to Punjab, and in March 1672, they moved to Chakk Nanaki in the Himalayan foothills of north India, called the Sivalik range, where he was schooled.

Tegh Bahadur was petitioned by Kashmiri Pandits in 1675 for protection from the fanatic persecution by Iftikar Khan, the Mughal governor of Kashmir under Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Tegh Bahadur considered a peaceful resolution by meeting Aurangzeb, but was cautioned by his advisors that his life may be at risk. The young Gobind Das – to be known as Gobind Singh after 1699 – advised his father that no one was more worthy to lead and make a sacrifice than him. His father made the attempt, but was arrested then publicly beheaded in Delhi on 11 November 1675 under the orders of Aurangzeb for refusing to convert to Islam and the ongoing conflicts between Sikhism and the Islamic Empire. Before dying, Tegh Bahadur wrote a letter to Gobind Das (the letter was called Mahalla Dasven and it is part of the Guru Granth Sahib) as one last test to find the next Guru, after his father&#x27;s martyrdom he was made the tenth Sikh Guru on Vaisakhi on 29 March 1676.

The education of Gobind Singh continued after he became the 10th Guru, both in reading and writing as well as martial arts such as horse riding and archery. The Guru learned Farsi in a year and at the age of 6 started training in martial arts. In 1684, he wrote the Chandi di Var in Punjabi language – a legendary war between the good and the evil, where the good stands up against injustice and tyranny, as described in the ancient Sanskrit text Markandeya Purana. He stayed in Paonta, near the banks of river Yamuna, until 1685.

Guru Gobind Singh had three wives:
*At age 10, he married Jito on 21 June 1677 at Basantgaṛh, 10 km north of Anandpur. The couple had three sons: Jujhar Singh (b. 1691), Zorawar Singh (b. 1696), and Fateh Singh (b. 1699).
*At age 17, he married Sundari on 4 April 1684 at Anandpur. The couple had one son, Ajit Singh (b. 1687).
*At age 33, he married Sahib Devan on 15 April 1700 at Anandpur. They had no children, but she had an influential role in Sikhism. Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed her as the &quot;Mother of the Khalsa&quot;. The Guru initially rejected her marriage proposal as he was already married and had four sons. The Sangat and the Guru&#x27;s family agreed to the marriage. However, Gobind Singh made it clear that his relationship with Sahib Diwan will be spiritual and not physical.

The life example and leadership of Gobind Singh have been of historical importance to the Sikhs. He institutionalized the Khalsa (literally, Pure Ones), who played the key role in protecting the Sikhs long after his death, such as during the nine invasions of Panjab and the attacks by Ahmad Shah Abdali from Afghanistan between 1747 and 1769.

=== Birth name ===
While his birth name is commonly acknowledged as being &quot;Gobind Rai&quot;, J.S Grewal and W.H McLeod, among other scholars, point out that hukamnamas and documents issued by his father, Guru Tegh Bahadur, mention him as &quot;Gobind Das&quot;. According to McLeod, &quot;Gobind Rai&quot; was an exonym used within Muslim sources.

=== Birth year ===
Whilst the commonly accepted birth year for the guru is 1666, some sources record his birth year as being 1661. Sikhologist Louis E. Fenech believes 1661 is more likely to be the true birth year of the guru as it lines up more reliably with events later in his life regarding his coming-of-age and leadership in 1679.

==Founding the Khalsa==

In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh requested the Sikhs to congregate at Anandpur on Vaisakhi (the annual spring harvest festival). According to the Sikh tradition, he asked for a volunteer. One came forward, whom he took inside a tent. The Guru returned to the crowd alone, with a bloody sword. He asked for another volunteer, and repeated the same process of returning from the tent without anyone and with a bloodied sword four more times. After the fifth volunteer went with him into the tent, the Guru returned with all five volunteers, all safe. He called them the &quot;Panj Pyare&quot; and the first Khalsa in the Sikh tradition.

Gobind Singh then mixed water and sugar into an iron bowl, stirring it with a double-edged sword to prepare what he called Amrit (&quot;nectar&quot;). He then administered this to the &quot;Panj Pyare&quot;, accompanied with recitations from the Adi Granth, thus founding the &quot;khande ka pahul&quot; (baptization ceremony) of a Khalsa – a warrior community. The Guru also gave them a new surname &quot;Singh&quot; (lion). After the first five Khalsa had been baptized, the Guru asked the five to baptize him as a Khalsa. This made the Guru the sixth Khalsa, and his name changed from Guru Gobind Das to Guru Gobind Singh. This initiation ceremony replaced the charan pahul ritual practiced by the previous gurus, in which an initiate would drink the water either the Guru or a masand of the guru had dipped their right toe in.
Gobind Singh initiated the Five K&#x27;s tradition of the Khalsa,
* Kesh: uncut hair.
* Kangha: a wooden comb.
* Kara: an iron or steel bracelet worn on the wrist.
* Kirpan: a sword.
* Kacchera: short breeches.

He also announced a code of discipline for Khalsa warriors. Tobacco, eating &#x27;halal&#x27; meat (a way of slaughtering in which the animal&#x27;s throat is slit open and it is left to bleed before being slaughtered), fornication and adultery were forbidden. The Khalsas also agreed to never interact with those who followed rivals or their successors. The co-initiation of men and women from different castes into the ranks of Khalsa also institutionalized the principle of equality in Sikhism regardless of one&#x27;s caste or gender. Gobind Singh&#x27;s significance to the Sikh tradition has been very important, as he institutionalized the Khalsa, resisted the ongoing persecution by the Mughal Empire, and continued the defence of dharma, by which he meant True Religion, against the assault of Aurangzeb.
He introduced ideas that indirectly challenged the discriminatory taxes imposed by the Mughal authorities. For example, Aurangzeb had imposed taxes on non-Muslims that were collected from the Sikhs as well, the jizya (poll tax on non-Muslims), pilgrim tax, and &quot;Bhaddar&quot; tax – the last being a tax to be paid by anyone following the Hindu ritual of shaving the head after the death of a loved one and cremation. Guru Gobind Singh declared that Khalsa does not need to continue this practice, because &quot;Bhaddar&quot; is not dharam, but a &quot;bharam&quot; (illusion). Not shaving the head also meant not having to pay the taxes by Sikhs who lived in Delhi and other parts of the Mughal Empire. However, the new code of conduct also led to internal disagreements between Sikhs in the 18th century, particularly between the Nanakpanthi and the Khalsa.

Gobind Singh had a deep respect for the Khalsa and stated that there is no difference between the True Guru and the &quot;sangat&quot; (panth). Before his founding of the Khalsa, the Sikh movement had used the Sanskrit word &quot;Sisya&quot; (literally, disciple or student), but the favored term thereafter became Khalsa. Additionally, prior to the Khalsa, the Sikh congregations across India had a system of &quot;Masands&quot; appointed by the Sikh Gurus. The &quot;Masands&quot; led the local Sikh communities, local temples, and collected wealth and donations for the Sikh cause. Gobind Singh concluded that the &quot;Masands&quot; system had become corrupt, he abolished them and introduced a more centralized system with the help of Khalsa that was under his direct supervision. These developments created two groups of Sikhs, those who initiated as Khalsa, and others who remained Sikhs but did not undertake the initiation. The Khalsa Sikhs saw themselves as a separate religious entity, while the Nanakpanthi Sikhs retained their different perspective.

The Khalsa warrior community tradition started by Guru Gobind Singh has contributed to modern scholarly debate on pluralism within Sikhism. His tradition has survived into the modern times, with initiated Sikh referred to as Khalsa Sikh, while those who do not get baptized referred to as Sahajdhari Sikhs.

=== Guru Panth ===
Whilst Guru Gobind Singh passed on the mantle of guruship to both the &quot;Guru Granth&quot; and &quot;Guru Panth&quot;, the practice of Guru Panth was prevalent in the 18th century during the era of the Sikh Confederacy but fell into obscurity during the rise of Ranjit Singh. Today, the Guru Panth is rarely evoked, being overshadowed by the more popular &quot;Guru Granth&quot;.

==Sikh scriptures==

Piara Singh Padam in his Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji de Darbari Ratan highlights that Guru Gobind Singh gave as much regard to the pen as to the sword.
Guru Gobind Singh is credited in the Sikh tradition with finalizing the Kartarpur Pothi (manuscript) of the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; – the primary scripture of Sikhism. The final version did not accept the extraneous hymns in other versions, and included the compositions of his father Guru Tegh Bahadur. Gobind Singh also declared this text to be the eternal Guru for Sikhs.

Gobind Singh is also credited with the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;. It is a controversial religious text considered to be the second scripture by some Sikhs, and of disputed authority to other Sikhs. The standard edition of the text contains 1,428 pages with 17,293 verses in 18 sections. The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; includes hymns, mythological tales from Hindu texts, a celebration of the feminine in the form of goddess Durga, fables dealing with sexuality, an autobiography, secular stories from the Puranas and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, letters to others such as the Mughal emperor, as well as reverential discussion of warriors and theology.

In his writings Guru Gobind Singh uses a variety of pen names such as Shyam, Raam, Kaal, Gobind Das, Gobind Singh, Nanak, and Shah Gobind.

According to the Bansavlinama, written in 1755 by Kesar Singh Chibbar, Sikhs requested that Gobind Singh merge Dasam Granth with the Guru Granth Sahib. Gobind Singh responded to the request by saying, &quot;This is the Adi Guru Granth; The root book. That one (Dasam Granth) is only for my diversion. Let this be kept in the mind and let the two stay separate.&quot;

The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; has a significant role in the initiation and the daily life of devout Khalsa Sikhs. Parts of its compositions such as the Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye and Benti Chaupai are the daily prayers (Nitnem) and sacred liturgical verses used in the initiation of Khalsa Sikhs.

==Wars==

The period following the execution of Guru Tegh Bahadur – the father of Guru Gobind Singh, was a period where the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb was an increasingly hostile enemy of the Sikh people. The Sikh resisted, led by Gobind Singh, and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts peaked during this period. Both Mughal administration and Aurangzeb&#x27;s army had an active interest in Gobind Singh. Aurangzeb issued an order to exterminate Gobind Singh and his family.

Gobind Singh believed in a Dharamyudh (war in defence of righteousness), something that is fought as a last resort, neither out of a wish for revenge nor for greed nor for any destructive goals. To the Guru, one must be prepared to die to stop tyranny, end persecution, and to defend one&#x27;s own religious values. He led fourteen wars with these objectives, but never took captives nor damaged anyone&#x27;s place of worship.

===Battles===

Guru Gobind Singh fought 21 battles against the Mughal Empire and the kings of Siwalik Hills.
* Battle of Anandpur (1682) Bhim Chand attacks Gobind Singh.
* Battle Of Anandpur (1685) Bhim Chand attacks Gobind Singh once again
* Battle of Bhangani (1688), which states chapter 8 of Gobind Singh&#x27;s &quot;Bicitra Natak&quot;, when Fateh Shah, along with mercenary commanders Hayat Khan and Najabat Khan, attacked his forces without any purpose. The Guru was aided by the forces of Kripal (his maternal uncle) and a Brahmin named Daya Ram, both of whom he praises as heroes in his text. The Guru&#x27;s cousin named Sango Shah was killed in the battle, a cousin from Guru Hargobind&#x27;s daughter.
* Battle of Nadaun (1691), against the Islamic armies of Mian Khan and his son Alif Khan, who were defeated by the allied forces of Gobind Singh, Bhim Chand and other Hindu kings of Himalayan foothills. The non-Muslims aligned to the Guru had refused to pay tribute to the Islamic officials based in Jammu.
* In 1693, Aurangzeb was fighting the Hindu Marathas in the Deccan region of India, and he issued orders that Guru Gobind Singh and Sikhs should be prevented from gathering in Anandpur in large numbers.
* Battle of Anandpur (1695) Mughals attack Gobind Singh at Anandpur 
* Battle of Guler (1696), first against the Muslim commander Dilawar Khan&#x27;s son Rustam Khan, near Sutlej river, where the Guru teamed up with the Hindu king of Guler and routed the Muslim army. The commander sent his general Hussain Khan against the armies of the Guru and the Guler kingdom, a war fought near Pathankot, and Hussain Khan was defeated and killed by the joint forces.
After the creation of the Khalsa the Hill Rajas, who had previously lost in battle to Guru Gobind Singh, sent a petition to Delhi requesting they act immediately and join them in battle against the Guru.l
* Battle of Anandpur (1699), was against two Rajas of the hills.
* Battle of Anandpur (1700), against the Mughal army of Aurangzeb, who had sent 10,000 soldiers, in response to the Hill Rajas letter, under the command of Painda Khan and Dina Beg. In direct combat between Gobind Singh and Painda Khan, the latter was killed. His death led to the Mughal army fleeing the battlefield.
* First siege of Anandpur, The hill Rajas of northern Punjab regrouped after defeat at Anandpur the previous year and resumed their campaign against Gobind Singh, joining forces with Gujar and other tribesmens to besiege Anandpur, northeast of Ludhiana. Gujar leader Jagatullah was killed on the first day and the Rajas were driven off after a brilliant defence led by the Guru&#x27;s son Ajit Singh.
* Battle of Taragarh was a battle fought in defence during the Siege of Anandpur.
* Battle of Basoli (1702), against the Mughal army; named after the kingdom of Basoli whose Raja Dharampul supported the Guru in the battle. The Mughal army was supported by rival kingdom of Kahlur led by Raja Ajmer Chand. The battle ended when the two sides reached a tactical peace.
* First Battle of Chamkaur (1702), Mughal Army was repulsed. 
* Battle of Anandpur (1703) was fought between the Sikhs and the Hill Rajas. The Sikh won. 
* First Battle of Anandpur (1704), Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb sent a fresh force into northern Punjab under General Saiyad Khan, later replaced by Ramjan Khan. Ramjan was mortally wounded in further very heavy fighting around the Sikh stronghold at Anandpur, northeast of Ludhiana, and his force again withdrew. 
* Second siege of Anandpur, According to scholars, this siege was triggered by the proliferation of armed Sikhs in Anandpur, the increasing numbers creating a shortage of supplies. This led the Sikhs to raid local villages for supplies, food, and forage, which in turn dramatically frustrated the local pahari rajas who forged alliances and mounted an attack on Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s patrimony. The Mughal general was fatally wounded by Sikh soldiers, and the army withdrew. Aurangzeb then sent a larger army with two generals, Wazir Khan and Zaberdast Khan in May 1704, to destroy the Sikh resistance. The approach the Islamic army took in this battle was to lay a protracted siege against Anandpur, from May to December, cutting off all food and other supplies moving in and out, along with repeated battles. Some Sikh men deserted the Guru during the Anandpur siege in 1704 and escaped to their homes where their women shamed them and they rejoined the Guru&#x27;s army and died fighting with him in 1705. Towards the end, the Guru, his family, and followers accepted an offer by Aurangzeb of safe passage out of Anandpur. However, as they left Anandpur in two batches, they were attacked, and one of the batches with Mata Gujari and Guru&#x27;s two sons – Zorawar Singh aged 8 and Fateh Singh aged 5 – were taken captive by the Mughal army. Both his children were executed by burying them alive into a wall. The grandmother Mata Gujari died there as well.
* Battle of Sarsa (1704), against the Mughal army led by general Wazir Khan; the Muslim commander had conveyed Aurangzeb&#x27;s promise of a safe passage to Guru Gobind Singh and his family in early December. However, when the Guru accepted the offer and left, Wazir Khan took captives, executed them and pursued the Guru. The retreating troops he was with were repeatedly attacked from behind, with heavy casualties to the Sikhs, particularly while crossing the Sarsa river.
* Battle of Chamkaur (1704) Regarded as one of the most important battles in Sikh history. It was against the Mughal army led by Nahar Khan; the Muslim commander was killed, while on Sikh side the remaining two elder sons of the Guru – Ajit Singh and Jujhar Singh, along with other Sikh soldiers were killed in this battle.
* Battle of Muktsar (1705), the Guru&#x27;s army was re-attacked by the Mughal army, being hunted down by general Wazir Khan, in the arid area of Khidrana-ki-Dhab. The Mughals were blocked again, but with many losses of Sikh lives – particularly the famous &quot;Chalis Mukte&quot; (literally, the &quot;forty liberated ones&quot;), and this was the last battle led by Guru Gobind Singh. The place of battle called Khidrana was renamed about a 100 years later by Ranjit Singh to Mukt-sar (literally, &quot;lake of liberation&quot;), after the term &quot;Mukt&quot; (moksha) of the ancient Indian tradition, in honour of those who gave their lives for the cause of liberation.
* Battle of Baghaur (1707) was fought against the Raja of Bhghaur and the locals of the area. It began over a dispute when some camels of the Guru went and ate the trees of a local gardener. The gardener took the camels and the rider hostage. Sikh negotiated for the release but he refused which led to a battle.
* Battle of Jajau (1707) was fought between Azam Shah and Bhadur Shah over the Mughal throne. Bahdur Shah sought Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s assistance. Gobind Singh provided assistance and is said to have killed Azam Shah in battle.

===Mughal accounts===
The Muslim historians of the Mughal court wrote about Guru Gobind Singh as well as the geopolitics of the times he lived in, and these official Persian accounts were readily available and the basis of colonial era English-language description of Sikh history.

According to Dhavan, the Persian texts that were composed by Mughal court historians during the lifetime of Gobind Singh were hostile to him but presented the Mughal perspective. They believed that the religious Guru tradition of Sikhs had been corrupted by him, through the creation of a military order willing to resist the imperial army. Dhavan writes that some Persian writers who wrote decades or a century after the death of Gobind Singh evolved from relying entirely on court histories of the Mughals which disparage the Guru, to including stories from the Sikh &quot;gurbilas&quot; text that praise the Guru.

The Mughal accounts suggest that the Muslim commanders viewed the Sikh &quot;panth&quot; as one divided into sects with different loyalties.

=== Relationship with other religious groups ===
As a result of the violent hostility between the Sikhs and the Mughal armies, Guru Gobind Singh ordered the social segregation between the Khalsa and the Muslims, the sentiments of which are reiterated in the contemporary and posthumous rahit-namas. To a lesser extent, injunctions were also made prohibiting the partake in certain Hindu rituals and beliefs as well as against schismatic Sikh factions opposed to the orthodox Khalsa community.

== Post-war years ==
After the Second Battle of Anandpur in 1704, the Guru and his remaining soldiers moved and stayed in different spots including hidden in places such as the Machhiwara jungle of southern Panjab.

Some of the various spots in north, west, and central India where the Guru lived after 1705, include Hehar with Kirpal Das (maternal uncle), Manuke, Mehdiana, Chakkar, Takhtupura, and Madhe and Dina (Malwa region). He stayed with relatives or trusted Sikhs such as the three grandsons of Rai Jodh, a devotee of Guru Har Gobind.

===Zafarnama===

Guru Gobind Singh saw the war conduct of Aurangzeb and his army against his family and his people as a betrayal of a promise, unethical, unjust, and impious. After all of Gobind Singh&#x27;s children had been killed by the Mughal army and the battle of Muktsar, the Guru wrote a defiant letter in Persian to Aurangzeb, titled &quot;Zafarnama&quot; (literally, &quot;epistle of victory&quot;), a letter which the Sikh tradition considers important towards the end of the 19th century.

The Guru&#x27;s letter was stern yet conciliatory to Aurangzeb. He indicted the Mughal Emperor and his commanders in spiritual terms, and accused them of a lack of morality both in governance and in the conduct of war. The letter predicted that the Mughal Empire would soon end, because it persecutes, and is full of abuse, falsehood, and immorality. The letter is spiritually rooted in Gobind Singh&#x27;s beliefs about justice and dignity without fear.

==Death of family members==


Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s four sons, also referred to as Chaar Sahibzaade (the four princes), were killed during his lifetime – the elder two in a battle with Mughals, and the younger two executed by the Mughal governor of Sirhind. The Guru and his two elder sons had escaped the siege of Anandpur in December 1704 and reached Chamkaur, but they were pursued by a large Mughal army. In the ensuing battle, Guru&#x27;s elder sons, also called the &#x27;Vaade Sahibzaade&#x27; fought bravely, but the Mughal army was much larger and well equipped.
While the Guru was taken to a safe place, his elder sons, Sahibzada Ajit Singh aged 17, and Jujhar Singh aged 13 were killed in the Battle of Chamkaur in December 1704 against the Mughal army.

Gobind Singh&#x27;s mother Mata Gujri and his two younger sons got separated from him after escaping the Mughal siege of Anandpur in December 1704; and were later arrested by the forces of Wazir Khan, the Mughal governor of Sirhind. The younger pair, called the &#x27;Chotte Sahibzaade&#x27;, along with their grandmother were imprisoned in an Open Tower (Thanda Burj), in chilling winter days. Around 26 and 27 December 1704, the younger sons, Sahibzada Fateh Singh aged 6 and Zorawar Singh aged 9, were offered a safe passage if they converted to Islam, which they refused; and subsequently, Wazir Khan ordered them to be bricked alive in the wall. Gujri fainted on hearing about her grandsons&#x27; death and died shortly thereafter.

His adopted son Zorawar Singh Palit whose real name is unknown died in 1708 near Chittorgarh Fort in a skirmish with local soldiers. According to Sainapati, Zorawar Singh Palit had managed to escape in the Battle of Chamkaur and later met the Guru in Rajputana after which he got in a minor scuffle at Chittorgarh and died.

According to Sikh historians, Guru Gobind Singh took the harsh news about the execution of his sons, Fateh Singh and Zorawar Singh, with stoic calm, and wrote &quot;What use is it to put out a few sparks when you raise a mighty flame instead?&quot;.

== Death ==
Aurangzeb died in 1707, and immediately a succession struggle began between his sons who attacked each other. Guru Gobind Singh supported Bahadur Shah I in the Battle of Jajau by sending 200–300 Sikhs under Bhai Dharam Singh and later joining the battle themselves. According to Sikh sources it was Guru Gobind Singh who killed Azam Shah. The official successor Bahadur Shah invited Guru Gobind Singh with his army to meet him in person in the Deccan region of India for reconciliation. Guru Gobind Singh hoped to get Anandpur, his former stronghold back, and remained close to the imperial camp for nearly a year. His appeals for the restoration of his lands turned out to be ineffectual however as Bahadur Shah went on postponing any restoration to the status quo ante as he was not willing to offend either the Guru or the hill rajas.

Wazir Khan, a Mughal army commander and the Nawab of Sirhind, against whose army the Guru had fought several wars, commissioned two Afghans, Jamshed Khan, and Wasil Beg, to follow the Guru&#x27;s army as it moved for the meeting with Bahadur Shah, and then assassinate the Guru. The two secretly pursued the Guru whose troops were in the Deccan area of India, and entered the camp when the Sikhs had been stationed near river Godavari for months. They gained access to the Guru and Jamshed Khan stabbed him two times resulting in a fatal wound at Nanded. Some scholars state that the assassin who killed Guru Gobind Singh may not have been sent by Wazir Khan, but was instead sent by the Mughal army that was staying nearby.

According to Senapati&#x27;s &quot;Sri Gur Sobha&quot;, an early 18th-century writer, the fatal wounds of the Guru was one below his heart. The Guru fought back and killed the assassin, while the assassin&#x27;s companion was killed by the Sikh guards as he tried to escape.

The Guru died of his wounds a few days later on 7 October 1708. His death fuelled a long and bitter war of the Sikhs with the Mughals.

According to the Bansavalinama by Kesar Singh Chibber written in 1768, the Guru&#x27;s last words were, &quot;The Granth is the Guru and it will bring you to Akal. The Guru is the Khalsa and the Khalsa is the Guru. The seat has been given to Sri Sahib Mata Devi. Love each other and expand the community. Follow the words of the Granth. The Sikh that follows Sikhi shall be with the Guru. Follow the conduct of the Guru. Always remain with Waheguru.&quot;

== Dohra Mahalla Dasvan (10) ==

While it is generally believed that Guru Gobind Singh did not add any of his own compositions to the Guru Granth Sahib, there are some who argue that a single rhyming couplet, known as a &quot;Dohra&quot;, of the tenth Guru, titled &quot;Dohra Mahalla Dasvan&quot; (10), near the end of the scripture on page 1429 is the work of Guru Gobind Singh.

The composition in-question is as follows:

According to Trilochan Singh, Guru Tegh Bahadur sent a letter in the form of a &quot;sloka&quot; to the young Gobind Das while incarcerated in Delhi by Aurangzeb, delivered personally to the young child by Bhai Uda and Pundit Kirpa Ram:

It was a test of the potential successor to the Guruship. Gobind Das, who was writing from Anandpur, replied with a &quot;dohra&quot;, which affirmed his readiness to succeed as the next Sikh guru and calmed any apprehensions that the Sikhs of the time felt about the prospect. Guru Tegh Bahadur knew his son was prepared to the take the reins and lead the Sikh community after his death. After reading his son&#x27;s reply, Guru Tegh Bahadur sent a final message to his son:

This story is recorded in the account of Bhai Mani Singh written in his &quot;Sikhan di Bhagat Mal&quot; composition. The story is further recounted in other historical sources, such as &quot;Suraj Prakash&quot;, &quot;Mehma Prakash&quot;, and Kesar Singh Chibber&#x27;s &quot;Bansavalinama&quot;. The SGPC, for unknown reasons, decided to not ascribe the dohra to Guru Gobind Singh when it standardized the Guru Granth Sahib, which it subsequently publishes without it, despite the dohra being ascribed to the tenth Guru in many 17th and 18th century manuscripts of the Guru Granth Sahib, including many of which bear a signature of the tenth Guru.

== Sectoral views ==

=== Namdhari ===
The Namdhari sect believes that Guru Gobind Singh did not die in 1708 but rather continued to live-on under the alias and pseudonym of &#x27;Ajapal Singh&#x27; and passed on the guruship to Balak Singh at the age of 146 in the year 1812. 

=== Radha Soami ===
Some of the Radhasoami movement, a contemporary Sant Mat tradition, have linked Guru Gobind Singh, and therefore the lineage of Sikh gurus, to Tulsi Sahib of Hathras by claiming that Guru Gobind Singh passed on leadership to a supposed individual named Ratnagar Rao, who then passed on the mastership to Tulsi Sahib of Hathras. The claim postulates that Guru Gobind Singh visited a ruling family of Peshwas whilst he was in the Deccan, which is how Tulsi Sahib became acquainted with the Sikh guru after he stayed with the family. However, there is no evidence that Ratnagar Rao actually existed and this claim first arose with Kirpal Singh, possibly as an effort to link the Radhasoami movement to the lineage and teachings of Sikhism. This belief of a connection between Guru Gobind Singh and Tulsi Sahib is not widely accepted by Radhasoami branches aside from the Ruhani Satsang branch.

== In popular culture ==
Indian films about Guru Gobind Singh include:
*&quot;Sarbans Dani Guru Gobind Singh&quot; is a 1998 Indian Punjabi-language drama film directed by Ram Maheshwari. He is not directly portrayed by an actor.
*&quot;Chaar Sahibzaade&quot;, a 2014 Indian computer-animated film by Harry Baweja, is about his sons Ajit Singh, Jujhar Singh, Zorawar Singh, and Fateh Singh.
*&quot;Chaar Sahibzaade: Rise of Banda Singh Bahadur&quot;, a 2016 Indian computer-animated film by Harry Bawej, is a sequel to &quot;Chaar Sahibzaade&quot; about Baba Banda Singh Bahadur&#x27;s fight against the Mughals under Guru Gobind Singh.

<text>Tel Hai ( , &quot;Hill of Life&quot;) is a name of the former Jewish settlement in northern Galilee, the site of an early battle between Jews and Arabs heralding the growing civil conflict, and of a monument, tourist attraction, and a college. It is currently part of kibbutz Kfar Giladi.

The Battle of Tel Hai on 1 March 1920, which gave Tel Hai its fame, was significant, from a Jewish perspective, far beyond the small number of civil combatants on either side – mainly due to its influence on Israeli culture, both inspiring an enduring national myth and profoundly influencing the military of the Yishuv and political strategies over several decades.

In retrospect, it can be regarded as the first military engagement between Jews and Arabs, though at the time neither combatant side recognized it as such.

==History==

Tel Hai, initially named Talha (), was first settled in 1905 as an agricultural courtyard for six workers from a northern colony El Mutallah (Metula). The land for the outpost was purchased by Haim Kalvarisky, a clerk of the Jewish Colonization Association. In 1918, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, Tel Hai was given its Hebrew name, and became a border outpost. The area was subsequently subject to intermittent border adjustments among the British and French colonial powers.

In 1919, the British relinquished the northern section of Upper Galilee containing Tel Hai, Metulla, Hamrah, and Kfar Giladi to French jurisdiction. The Zionist movement was greatly displeased with this, since it would have left the sources of the Jordan River outside the borders of British Mandatory Palestine, where the Zionist state they envisaged was to be established. Therefore, the few isolated settlements in this territory assumed a strategic value from the Zionist point of view. Still, there was a fierce debate among factions and leaders of the Yishuv, some of whom advocated letting Tel Hai and the other outposts hang on at all costs, while others regarded their situation as untenable and advocated withdrawing from them.

Arabs in this area at the time were not primarily involved in activities against the early Jewish militias, but rather in strongly opposing the imposition of the French Mandate of Syria, which they regarded as betrayal of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence made during the Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule. In a letter dated 24 October 1915, Sir Henry McMahon, then His Majesty&#x27;s High Commissioner in Egypt, promises the Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, to &quot;recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories proposed by him (Sharif of Mecca), the exact extent of which became a matter of dispute.&quot;

The Zionist militias in Tel Hai, headed by the Russian-born Jewish commander Joseph Trumpeldor wanted the area to be restored to British control which they hoped would eventually lead to its becoming part of a future Jewish state. However, as newcomers to the area recently arrived from Europe, they were suspected of being pro-French, which ultimately led to armed clashes.

In one notable exchange, on March 1, 1920, Shi&#x27;ite Arabs from Jabal Amil in southern Lebanon sought to search Tel Hai, however the Jews called for reinforcements from the kibbutz Kfar Giladi. Joseph Trumpeldor and ten men attempted to drive the Shi&#x27;ite militias away.

At the end of a verbal dispute, an armed confrontation did break out, in which six of the Tel Hai Jews were killed and the remaining Jews retreated, whereupon the place was burned. The total number of killed was 13 (5 Muslims and 8 Jews). The British and the French, at the behest of the Zionists, ultimately agreed this area of Upper Galilee was to be included in Mandatory Palestine. It was thus possible for Tel Hai to be resettled in 1921, though it did not become a viable independent community and in 1926 it was absorbed into the kibbutz of Kfar Giladi.

==Tel Hai monument==

A Jewish national monument in Upper Galilee, Israel commemorates the deaths of eight Jews (six men and two women), among them the Russian-born Jewish commander Joseph Trumpeldor, who fell in the above-detailed engagement on 1 March 1920. The resolute actions of Trumpeldor and his colleagues against a much larger Arab force inspired the Jews of Jerusalem. The memorial is known for a statue of a defiant lion representing Trumpeldor and his comrades. The city of Kiryat Shmona, literally &quot;Town of the Eight&quot; was named after them.

<doc id="518565" wikidata="Q1355864" url="?curid=518565" title="Hyperpolarization (biology)">
<text>Hyperpolarization is a change in a cell&#x27;s membrane potential that makes it more negative. Cells typically have a negative resting potential, with neuronal action potentials depolarizing the membrane. When the resting membrane potential is made more negative, it increases the minimum stimulus needed to surpass the needed threshold. Neurons naturally become hyperpolarized at the end of an action potential, which is often referred to as the relative refractory period. Relative refractory periods typically last 2 milliseconds, during which a stronger stimulus is needed to trigger another action potential. Cells can also become hyperpolarized depending on channels and receptors present on the membrane, which can have an inhibitory effect.

Hyperpolarization is often caused by efflux of K+ (a cation) through K+ channels, or influx of Cl– (an anion) through Cl– channels. On the other hand, influx of cations, e.g. Na+ through Na+ channels or Ca2+ through Ca2+ channels, inhibits hyperpolarization. If a cell has Na+ or Ca2+ currents at rest, then inhibition of those currents will also result in hyperpolarization. This voltage-gated ion channel response is how the hyperpolarization state is achieved. 

==Voltage-gated ion channels and hyperpolarization==
 Voltage gated ion channels respond to changes in the membrane potential. Voltage gated potassium, chloride and sodium channels are key components in the generation of the action potential as well as hyper-polarization. These channels work by selecting an ion based on electrostatic attraction or repulsion allowing the ion to bind to the channel. This releases the water molecule attached to the channel and the ion is passed through the pore. Voltage gated sodium channels open in response to a stimulus and close again. This means the channel either is open or not, there is no part way open. Sometimes the channel closes but is able to be reopened right away, known as channel gating, or it can be closed without being able to be reopened right away, known as channel inactivation.

At resting potential, both the voltage gated sodium and potassium channels are closed but as the cell membrane becomes depolarized the voltage gated sodium channels begin to open up and the neuron begins to depolarize, creating a current feedback loop known as the Hodgkin cycle. However, potassium ions naturally move out of the cell and if the original depolarization event was not significant enough then the neuron does not generate an action potential. If all the sodium channels are open, however, then the neuron becomes ten times more permeable to sodium than potassium, quickly depolarizing the cell to a peak of +40 mV. At this level the sodium channels begin to inactivate and voltage gated potassium channels begin to open. This combination of closed sodium channels and open potassium channels leads to the neuron re-polarizing and becoming negative again. The neuron continues to re-polarize until the cell reaches ~ –75 mV, which is the equilibrium potential of potassium ions. This is the point at which the neuron is hyperpolarized, between –70 mV and –75 mV. After hyperpolarization the potassium channels close and the natural permeability of the neuron to sodium and potassium allows the neuron to return to its resting potential of –70 mV. During the refractory period, which is after hyper-polarization but before the neuron has returned to its resting potential the neuron is capable of triggering an action potential due to the sodium channels ability to be opened, however, because the neuron is more negative it becomes more difficult to reach the action potential threshold.

HCN channels are activated by hyperpolarization.

Recent research has shown that neuronal refractory periods can exceed 20 milliseconds where the relation between hyperpolarization and the neuronal refractory was questioned.

==Experimental technique==

Hyperpolarization is a change in membrane potential. Neuroscientists measure it using a technique known as patch clamping that allows them to record ion currents passing through individual channels. This is done using a glass micropipette, also called a patch pipette, with a 1 micrometer diameter. There is a small patch that contains a few ion channels and the rest is sealed off, making this the point of entry for the current. Using an amplifier and a voltage clamp, which is an electronic feedback circuit, allows the experimenter to maintain the membrane potential at a fixed point and the voltage clamp then measures tiny changes in current flow. The membrane currents giving rise to hyperpolarization are either an increase in outward current or a decrease in inward current.

==Examples==
GABA receptors are commonly known to downregulate neuronal activity by various means. 

# GABAA can induce hyperpolarization through an influx of Cl– ions. GABAA itself is a chloride ion channel. This process of hyperpolarization is highly dependent on which direction Cl– flows. If Cl– travels into the cell, the flow of ions increases the voltage gradient. If Cl– flows out of the cell, the voltage gradient will decrease.
# GABAB induces hyperpolarization through K+ ion influx into the neuron. Unlike GABAA, GABAB is a G-Protein Coupled Receptor that activates potassium channels via Protein Kinase A (PKA) activation. Potassium typically has a higher concentration inside the cell, while sodium typically has a higher concentration outside. When potassium channels open, K+ ions flow out of the cell and cause the cell&#x27;s internal potential to become more negative. GABAB activation of PKA also leads to Ca channel inactivation in presynaptic neurons. This likely leads to inhibited synaptic transmission. 
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have been identified as channels that mediate hyperpolarization. They were initially discovered in pacemaker cells of the heart. These channels are controlled by cAMP, and activated by a hyperpolarized membrane. They allow the flow of Na+ and K+ ions, typically leading to a slight depolarization.

<doc id="518575" wikidata="Q321245" url="?curid=518575" title="Richard Serra">
<text>Richard Serra (November 2, 1938 – March 26, 2024) was an American artist known for his large-scale abstract sculptures made for site-specific landscape, urban, and architectural settings, and whose work has been primarily associated with Postminimalism. Described as &quot;one of his era&#x27;s greatest sculptors&quot;, Serra became notable for emphasizing the material qualities of his works and exploration of the relationship between the viewer, the work, and the site.

Serra pursued English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, before shifting to visual art. He graduated with a B.A. in English Literature from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1961, where he met influential muralists Rico Lebrun and Howard Warshaw. Supporting himself by working in steel mills, Serra&#x27;s early exposure to industrial materials influenced his artistic trajectory. He continued his education at Yale University, earning a B.A. in Art History and an M.F.A. in 1964. While in Paris on a Yale fellowship in 1964, he befriended composer Philip Glass and explored Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s studio, both of which had a strong influence on his work. His time in Europe also catalyzed his subsequent shift from painting to sculpture.

From the mid-1960s onward, particularly after his move to New York City in 1966, Serra worked to radicalize and extend the definition of sculpture beginning with his early experiments with rubber, neon, and lead, to his large-scale steel works. His early works in New York, such as &quot;To Lift&quot; from 1967 and &quot;Thirty-Five Feet of Lead Rolled Up&quot; from 1968, reflected his fascination with industrial materials and the physical properties of his chosen mediums. His large-scale works, both in urban and natural landscapes, have reshaped public interactions with art and, at times, were also a source of controversy, such as that caused by his &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; in Manhattan in 1981. Serra was married to artist Nancy Graves between 1965 and 1970, and Clara Weyergraf between 1981 and his death in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Serra was born in San Francisco, California, on November 2, 1938, to Tony and Gladys Serra – the second of three sons. His father was Spanish from Mallorca and his mother Gladys was the daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants from Odessa. From a young age, he was encouraged to draw by his mother. The young Serra would carry a small notebook for his sketches and his mother would introduce her son as &quot;Richard the artist.&quot; His father worked as a pipe fitter for a shipyard near San Francisco. Serra recounted a memory of a visit to the shipyard to see a boat launch when he was four years old. He watched as the ship transformed from an enormous weight to a buoyant, floating structure and noted that: &quot;All the raw material that I needed is contained in the reserve of this memory.&quot; Serra&#x27;s father, who was related to the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, later worked as a candy plant foreman.

Serra studied English literature at the University of California, Berkeley in 1957 before transferring to the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduating in 1961 with a BA in English Literature. In Santa Barbara, Serra met the muralists, Rico Lebrun and Howard Warshaw. Both were in the Art Department and took Serra under their wing. During this period, Serra worked in steel mills to earn a living, as he did at various times from ages 16–25.

Serra studied painting at Yale University and graduated with both a BA in Art History and an MFA in 1964. Fellow Yale alumni contemporaneous to Serra include Chuck Close, Rackstraw Downs, Nancy Graves, Brice Marden, and Robert Mangold. At Yale Serra met visiting artists from the New York School such as Philip Guston, Robert Rauschenberg, Ad Reinhardt, and Frank Stella. Serra taught a color theory course during his last year at Yale and after graduating was asked to help proof Josef Albers&#x27; notable color theory book &quot;Interaction of Color.&quot;

In 1964, Serra was awarded a one-year traveling fellowship from Yale and went to Paris where he met the composer Philip Glass who became a collaborator and long-time friend. In Paris, Serra spent time sketching in Constantin Brâncuși&#x27;s studio, partially reconstructed inside the Musée national d&#x27;Art moderne on the Avenue du Président Wilson, allowing Serra to study Brâncuși&#x27;s work, later drawing his own sculptural conclusions. An exact replica of Brâncuși&#x27;s studio is now located opposite the Centre Pompidou. Serra spent the following year in Florence, Italy on a Fulbright Grant. In 1966 while still in Italy, Serra made a trip to the Prado Museum in Spain and saw Diego Velázquez&#x27;s painting, &quot;Las Meninas.&quot; The artist realized he would not surpass the skill of that painting and decided to move away from painting.

While still in Europe, Serra began experimenting with nontraditional sculptural material. He had his first one-person exhibition &quot;Animal Habitats&quot; at Galleria Salita, Rome. Exhibited there were assemblages made with live and stuffed animals which would later be referenced as early work from the Arte Povera movement.

==Work==
===Early work===
Serra returned from Europe and moved to New York City in 1966. He continued his constructions using experimental materials such as rubber, latex, fiberglass, neon, and lead. His Belt Pieces were made with strips of rubber and hung on the wall using gravity as a forming device. Serra combined neon with continuous strips of rubber in his sculpture &quot;Belts&quot; (1966–67) referencing the serial abstraction in Jackson Pollock&#x27;s &quot;Mural&quot; (1963.) Around that time Serra wrote &quot;Verb List&quot; (1967) a list of transitive verbs (i.e. cast, roll, tear, prop, etc.) which he used as directives for his sculptures. &quot;To Lift&quot; (1967), and &quot;Thirty-Five Feet of Lead Rolled Up&quot; (1968), &quot;Splash Piece&quot; (1968), and &quot;Casting&quot; (1969), were some of the action-based works with origins in the verb list. Serra used lead in many of his constructs because of its adaptability. Lead is malleable enough to be rolled, folded, ripped, and melted. With &quot;To Lift&quot; (1967) Serra lifted a 10-foot (3 m) sheet of rubber off the ground making a free-standing form; with &quot;Thirty-five Feet of Lead Rolled Up&quot; (1968), Serra, with the help of Philip Glass, unrolled and rolled a sheet of lead as tightly as they could.

In 1968 Serra was included in the group exhibition &quot;Nine at Castelli&quot; at Castelli Warehouse in New York where he showed &quot;Prop&quot; (1968), &quot;Scatter Piece&quot; (1968), and made &quot;Splashing&quot; (1968) by throwing molten lead against the angle of the floor and wall. In 1969 his piece &quot;Casting&quot; was included in the exhibition &quot;Anti-Illusion: Procedures&quot;/&quot;Materials&quot; at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. In &quot;Casting&quot; the artist again threw molten lead against the angle of the floor and wall. He then pulled the casting made from the hardened lead away from the wall and repeated the action of splashing and casting creating a series of free-standing forms.

&quot;To prop&quot; is another transitive verb from Serra&#x27;s &quot;Verb List&quot; utilized by the artist for a series of assemblages of lead plates and poles dependent on leaning and gravity as a force to stay upright. Serra&#x27;s early Prop Pieces such as &quot;Prop&quot; (1968) relied mainly on the wall as a support. Serra wanted to move away from the wall to remove what he thought was a pictorial convention. In 1969 he propped four lead plates up on the floor like a house of cards. The sculpture &quot;One Ton&quot; &quot;Prop: House of Cards&quot; (1969) weighed 1 ton and the four plates were self-supporting.

Another pivotal moment for Serra occurred in 1969 when he was commissioned by the artist Jasper Johns to make a Splash Piece in Johns&#x27;s studio. While Serra heated the lead plates to splash against the wall, he took one of the larger plates and set it in the corner where it stood on its own. Serra&#x27;s break into space followed shortly after with the sculpture &quot;Strike: To Roberta and Rudy&quot; (1969–71). Serra wedged an 8 by 24-foot (2.4 × 7.3 m) plate of steel into a corner and divided the room into two equal spaces. The work invited the viewer to walk around the sculpture, shifting the viewer&#x27;s perception of the room as they walked.

Serra first recognized the potential of working in large scale with his &quot;Skullcracker Series&quot; made during the exhibition, &quot;Art and Technology,&quot; at LACMA (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art) in 1969. He spent ten weeks building a number of ephemeral stacked steel pieces at the Kaiser Steelyard. Using a crane to explore the principles of counterbalance and gravity, the stacks were as tall as 30 to 40 feet (9 to 12 m) high and weighed between 60 and 70 tons (54.4 and 63.5 t). They were knocked down by the steelworkers at the end of each day. The scale of the stacks allowed Serra to begin to think of his work outside the confines of gallery and museum spaces.

===Landscape works===

In 1970 Serra received a Guggenheim Fellowship and traveled to Japan. His first outdoor sculptures, &quot;To Encircle Base Plate (Hexagram&quot;) (1970) and &quot;Sugi Tree&quot; (1970), were both installed in Ueno Park as part of the &quot;Tokyo Biennale.&quot;

While in Japan, Serra spent most of his time studying the Zen gardens and temples of the Myoshin-ji in Kyoto. The layout of the gardens revealed the landscape as a total field that can only be experienced by walking. The gardens changed Serra&#x27;s way of seeing space in relation to time. Upon returning to the United States he built his first site-specific outdoor work: &quot;To Encircle Base Plate Hexagram, Right Angles&quot; &quot;Inverted&quot; (1970). Here Serra embedded two semi-circular steel flanges, forming a ring 26 feet (7.9 m) in diameter, into the surface of 183rd Street in the Bronx. One semi-circle measured 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide and the second, 8 inches wide (203.2 mm). The work was visible from two perspectives: either when the viewer came directly upon it or from above on a stairway overlooking the street.

Throughout the 1970s Serra continued to make outdoor site-specific sculptures for urban areas and landscapes. Serra was interested in the topology of landscape and how one relates to it through movement, space, and time. His first landscape work was made in late 1970 when Serra was commissioned by the art patrons Joseph and Emily Rauh Pulitzer to build a sculpture on their property outside St. Louis, Missouri. &quot;Pulitzer Piece: Stepped Elevation&quot; (1970–71) was Serra&#x27;s first large-scale landscape work. Three plates measuring 5 feet (1.5 m) high by 40 to 50 feet (12 to 15 m) long were placed across approximately 3 acres (12 140 m2). The placement of the plates was determined by the fall of the landscape. Each plate was impaled into the ground far enough until its rise was 5 feet (1.5 m). Serra&#x27;s intention was for the plates to act as cuts in the landscape that function as surrogate horizons as viewers walked amongst them.

&quot;Shift&quot; (1970–72), Serra&#x27;s second endeavor in the landscape, was built in a field owned by the collector Roger Davidson in King City, Ontario. The sculpture is composed of six rectilinear concrete sections placed along the sloping landscape&quot;.&quot; In 2013 &quot;Shift&quot; was designated a Heritage Site under the Ontario Heritage Act. &quot;Shift,&quot; like &quot;Pulitzer Prizes pieces,&quot; was based on the elevational fall of the land over a given distance. The top edges of the plates function as a horizon being placed into specific elevational intervals as you walk the entire field.Serra&#x27;s subsequent site-specific works in landscape continued to explore the topography of the land and how the sculpture relates to this topography by way of movement, meditation, and perception of the viewer. Among the most notable of the landscape works are &quot;Porten i Slugten&quot; (1983–86) at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Denmark; &quot;Afangar (Stations, Stops on the Road, To Stop and Look: Forward and Back, To Take It All In)&quot; (1990) on Videy Island, Iceland; &quot;Schunnemunk Fork&quot; (1991) in Storm King Art Center, New York; &quot;Snake Eyes and Box Cars&quot; (1993) in Sonoma County, California; &quot;Te Tuhirangi Contour&quot; (2000–2) in Kaipara, New Zealand; and &quot;East-West/West-East&quot; (2014) in Qatar.

The sculpture &quot;Porten i Slugten&quot; (1983–86) was commissioned for the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark. After walking the museum grounds, Serra chose a ravine that runs towards the Kattegat Sea as the site for his sculpture. The ravine was the only area on the grounds that had not been landscaped. Two plates were set at an angle to each other at the end of a sloping stretch of path which fronts the ravine. The plates function in their location like a gate that opens as the viewer walks down the path toward the sea. Seen from the center of a bridge, which crosses the ravine and leads to the museum, the two plates form a single plane as if the gate had closed. As you walk down from the museum to the ocean below, the plates appear to have a continuous swinging motion. In 1988 Serra was invited by the National Gallery of Iceland to build a work. Serra chose Videy Island as the site for &quot;Afangar (Stations, Stops on the Road, To Stop and Look: Forward and Back, To Take It All In)&quot; (1990). The sculpture consists of nine pairs of basalt columns (a material indigenous to Iceland) and is placed along the periphery of Vesturey in the western part of the country. All nine locations share the same elevations in that the stones of each pair are situated at an elevation of 9 and 10 meters, respectively. Each set of stones is level at the top. All stones at the higher elevation measure 3 meters; all stones at the lower elevation measure 4 meters. Because of the variance of topography, the stones in a set are sometimes closer together, sometimes further apart. The rise and fall of Videy Island and the surrounding landscape are seen against the fixed measure of the standing stones. The stones are visible along the horizon of the island and orient the viewer against the rise and fall of the surrounding landscape.

&quot;Te Tuhirangi Contour&quot; (2000–2) is located on a vast open pasture on Gibbs Farm in Kaipara, New Zealand. The sculpture stands 20 feet (6 m) high and spans 844 feet (257 m) as one continuous contour that follows the rolling hills, expansion, and contraction of the landscape. The sculpture&#x27;s elevation is perpendicular to the fall of the land.

&quot;East-West/West-East&quot; (2014), located on an east-west axis in the Brouq Nature Reserve in Qatar, was commissioned by Sheika al-Mayassa al-Thani of Qatar. It consists of four steel plates either 54 or 48 feet (16.7 or 14.8 m) high. The plates are placed at irregular intervals in a valley that runs between two gypsum plateaus. The plates are level with each other and the elevation of the adjacent plateaus. The work spans less than a kilometer and all plates are visible from either end.

===Urban works===
In the landscape, the sculptural elements draw the viewer&#x27;s attention to the topology of the land as its walked. Serra&#x27;s site-specific Urban sculptures focus the viewer&#x27;s attention on the sculpture itself. Their locations often more accessible to the public than the landscape works, invite the viewer to walk inside, pass through and move around them. Because of the confines of Urban architecture, sculptures such as &quot;Sight Point&quot; (1972–75) at the Stedelijk Museum, The Netherlands; &quot;Termina&quot;l (1977) in Bochum, Germany; &quot;T.W.U&quot;. (1980) at the Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany; &quot;Fulcrum&quot; (1986–87), installed in Broadgate, London; &quot;Exchange&quot; (1996) outside the City of Luxembourg; or &quot;7&quot; (2011) on a pier in Doha, Qatar, reflect the verticality of their surrounding architecture. Outdoor sculptures like &quot;St. John&#x27;s Rotary Arc&quot; (1980) temporarily installed outside the Holland Tunnel entrance in New York City; &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; (1981) installed and later removed from New York City&#x27;s Federal Plaza; &quot;Clara-Clara&quot; (1983), temporarily installed at Tuileries, Place de la Concorde, Paris; &quot;Berlin Junction&quot; (1987) installed outside the Berlin Philharmonic; are all curved forms or arcs that open and close depending on the direction the viewer takes walking around them.

&quot;Sight Point&quot; (1972–75) was Serra&#x27;s first vertical Urban work and a continuation of the balance and counterbalance principles of his earlier work &quot;Prop&quot;. &quot;Sight Point&quot; stands outside the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, consisting of three vertical steel plates 10 feet (3 m) wide and 40 feet (12 m) high that lean in at an angle and forming a triangular space on the ground with three openings that can be walked through. Once inside the viewer can look up and see the sky framed by the triangular shape made by the leaning plates.

Another vertical sculpture, &quot;Terminal&quot; (1977), was conceived for &quot;Documenta VI&quot; in 1977. It was permanently installed on a traffic island between the street car tracks in front of a train station in Bochum, Germany. Serra chose the site because of its proximity to a high-traffic area. &quot;Exchange&quot; (1996), sited in a vehicular round-about on top of a highway tunnel, made of seven trapezoidal plates. The sculpture stands 60 feet (18 m) high and can be seen by drivers as they enter and leave the City of Luxembourg.

In 1980 Serra installed two sculptures, with the support of the Public Art Fund, in New York City. &quot;T.W.U.&quot; (1980) and &quot;St. John&#x27;s Rotary Arc&quot; (1980) were each placed in areas where traffic and people converged. &quot;T.W.U,&quot; a vertical sculpture consisting of three vertical plates, each 36 feet (11 m) high, was installed at a subway entrance near West Broadway between Leonard and Franklin Streets. The sculpture is now permanently installed outside the Deichterhallen, Hamburg, Germany. &quot;St. John&#x27;s Rotary Arc&quot;, one of Serra&#x27;s earliest curved sculptures, was 12 feet (3.6 m) high and spanned 180 feet (55 m). From 1980 to 1988 the site-specific sculpture was installed on the rotary at the entrance and exit to the Holland Tunnel.

The following year in 1981, a second site-specific curved sculpture &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; (1981) was installed in New York City&#x27;s Federal Plaza. Commissioned by the U.S. General Services Administration&#x27;s Art-in-Architecture Program following a rigorous selection process, the sculpture&#x27;s arc spanned 120 feet (36 m) and 12 feet (3.6 m) high. The sculpture was a curve that tilted and leaned away from its base. It was anchored into the plaza at both ends so that the center of the sculpture was raised. Serra&#x27;s intention for the sculpture was to draw pedestrians&#x27; attention to the sculpture as they crossed the plaza. &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; was met with resistance by workers in the Federal building. An eight-year campaign to remove the sculpture ensued and &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; was ultimately removed on March 15, 1989. In Serra&#x27;s defense to preserve the sculpture he stated &quot;To remove &quot;Tilted Arc&quot;, therefore, is to destroy it&quot;, advocating an art-for art&#x27;s sake mantra of site-specific artworks. Following the hearing and GSA&#x27;s decision, Serra responded that he would deny his authorship of &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; if it were relocated. and would consider it a &quot;derivative work&quot;. The case of &quot;Tilted Arc&quot; continues to highlight the tension surrounding the nature of public art and its intended audience.

===Gallery works===

Serra&#x27;s work has enjoyed numerous exhibitions in gallery and museum settings. His site-specific gallery installations are sometimes used to test ideas. Serra&#x27;s first U.S. solo exhibition was at the Leo Castelli Warehouse, New York City in 1969. There he exhibited ten lead Prop Pieces, a Scatter Piece: &quot;Cutting Device: Base Plate Measure&quot; (1969), and a Splash Piece: &quot;Splashing with Four Molds (To Eva Hesse)&quot; (1969).

Following his process-based works of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Serra began to solely use rolled or forged steel in his sculpture. &quot;Berlin Block (for Charlie Chaplin)&quot; (1977) was Serra&#x27;s first forged sculpture. Made for the plaza outside the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the sculpture weighs 70 tons. His other forged sculptures include &quot;Elevation for Mies (1985–88)&quot; at Museum Haus Esters, Krefeld, Germany; &quot;Philibert et Marguerite&quot; (1985), in the Musee de Brou, Bourg-en-Bresse, France; &quot;Weight and Measure&quot; (1992), a temporary site-specific installation at the Tate Gallery, London; &quot;Santa Fe Depot&quot; (2004), in the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego; and &quot;Equal&quot; (2015) in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

Serra&#x27;s most known series of sculptures using rolled steel plates are the &quot;Torqued Ellipses&quot;. In 1991 Serra visited Borromini&#x27;s Church of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane in Rome and mistook the ovals of the dome and the floor to be offset from one another. He thought to make a sculpture in this torqued form. Serra constructed models of this perceived form in his studio by cutting two ellipse-shaped pieces of wood and nailing a dowel between them. He then turned the ellipses so they were at a right angle to one another and wrapped a sheet of lead around the form. After making a template from the models Serra worked with an engineer to fabricate the sculptures. In total there are seven Torqued Ellipses and four Double Torqued Ellipses (an ellipse inside of an ellipse) dated between 1996 and 2004. Each sculpture has a different degree or torque and measures up to 13 feet (3.9 m) high. The sculptures all have an opening so that they can be walked through and around. Three Torqued Ellipses are on permanent view at Dia Beacon, New York.
In 2005 &quot;The Matter of Time&quot;, a commissioned installation, opened at the Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain. Consisting of eight sculptures spanning a decade from 1994 to 2005, &quot;The Matter of Time&quot; highlights the evolution of Serra&#x27;s sculptural forms. Serra chose to include five sculptures derived from the initial torqued ellipse: one single, one double ellipse, and three torqued spirals. The Torqued Spirals followed after the Double Torqued Ellipses when Serra decided to connect a double ellipses into one wound form that can be entered and walked through. The remaining sculptures in &quot;The Matter of Time&quot; are one closed (&quot;Blind Spot Reversed)&quot; and one open (&quot;Between the Torus and the Sphere&quot;) torus and spherical sculpture; and &quot;Snake&quot;: made of three parts, each comprising two identical conical sections inverted relative to each other and spanning 104 feet (31.7 m) overall. The sculptures are organized by Serra with intention. The direction which the viewer moves through the space creates a sensation of varying scale and proportion, and an awareness to the passing of time.

In 2008 Serra participated in &quot;Monumenta&quot;, an annual exhibition held in Paris&#x27;s Grand Palais featuring a single artist. For &quot;Monumenta&quot; Serra installed a single sculpture, &quot;Promenade&quot; (2008), consisting of five plates, each 55 feet (16.8 m) tall and 13 feet (4 m) wide, placed 100 feet (30 m) apart from one another across the cavernous interior of the Grand Palais. Overall, the sculpture spanned 656 feet (200 m). The plates were not placed in a line but stood side to side off the Grand Palais&#x27;s center axis. They tilted either left or right, leaned either toward or away from another, and the viewer as they strolled around them.

The sculpture &quot;Equal&quot; (2015), in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, consists of eight forged blocks. Each block measures 5 by 5 by 6 feet (1.5 × 1.7 × 1.8 m) and weighs 40 tons. The blocks are stacked in pairs and positioned on their longer or shorter sides so that each stack measures 11 feet (3.4 m) tall. When walking amongst the four stacks the viewer becomes aware of their own sense of weight, balance, and gravity in relation to the sculptures.

&quot;Four Rounds: Equal Weight, Unequal Measure&quot; (2017), consisting of four 82-ton (74 t) forged cylinders of varying dimensions is permanently installed at Glenstone in Potomac, Maryland. The sculpture is installed within a building designed by Thomas Phifer of Thomas Phifer and Partners, in collaboration with Serra to highlight the sculpture&#x27;s mass within the confines of the building&#x27;s interior.

===Drawings===
Drawing was integral to Serra&#x27;s practice. Serra made drawings on large sheets of canvas or handmade paper. They include horizontal or vertical compositions; constructions of overlapping sheets; or line drawings. His drawings were primarily done in paintstick, lithographic crayon, or charcoal and are always black. Serra experiments with different techniques and tools to manipulate and apply the medium. He often pushes the conventions of drawing towards a tactile, phenomenological experience of movement, time, and space. The artist said that his drawing practice is involved with &quot;repetition, knowing there&#x27;s no possibility of repeating, knowing that it&#x27;s going to yield something different each time.&quot;

Following his break into space with sculptures like &quot;Strike: To Roberta and Rudy&quot; (1969–71), Serra became interested in redefining architectural space with drawing as well. In 1974 Serra started to make his Installation Drawings—large-scale site-specific sheets of canvas completely covered in paintstick and stapled to the wall. The Installation Drawings cover the wall, or walls, of a given space. &quot;Shafrazi&quot; and &quot;Zadikians&quot; were two of Serra&#x27;s first Installation Drawings. Both were exhibited at Leo Castelli Gallery, New York City in 1974 and measured approximately 10 feet (3.2 m) high and 18 feet (5.5 m) wide overall. Serra continued to make Installation Drawing throughout his career. Other notable drawing series include: Diptychs (1989); Dead Weight (1991–92); &quot;Weight and Measure&quot; (1993–94)&quot;; Videy Afangar&quot; (1989–91); &quot;Rounds&quot; (1996–97); &quot;out-of-rounds&quot; (1999–2000); &quot;Line Drawings&quot; (2000–02&quot;); Solids&quot; (2008); &quot;Greenpoint Rounds&quot; (2009); &quot;Elevational Weights&quot; (2010); &quot;Rifts&quot; (2011–18); &quot;Transparencies&quot; (2011–13); &quot;Horizontal Reversals&quot; (2014) &quot;Rambles&quot; (2015–16); &quot;Composites&quot; (2016)&quot;; Horizontals and Verticals&quot; (2016–17); and &quot;Orchard Street&quot; (2018).

National and international survey exhibitions of Serra&#x27;s drawings have included &quot;Richard Serra: Tekeningen/Drawings 1971–1977&quot; at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 1978; &quot;Richard Serra: Tekeningen/Drawings&quot; at the Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastrict in 1990; &quot;Richard Serra Drawings: A Retrospective&quot; at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Menil Collection, Houston from 2011 to 2012; and &quot;Richard Serra: Drawings 2015–2017: Rambles, Composites, Rotterdam Verticals, Rotterdam Horizontals, Rifts&quot; at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen. Rotterdam, The Netherlands in 2017.

===Prints===
Serra began making prints in 1972. Working closely with Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles, Serra developed unconventional printing techniques. He made over 200 printed works and like his sculpture and drawing, his prints reflect an interest in process, scale, and experimentation with material.

His early lithographs starting in 1972 include the prints &quot;Circuit;&quot; &quot;Balance; Eight by Eight; or 183rd &amp; Webster Avenue,&quot; each titled after a sculpture created around the same time. In 1981 Serra produced his first lithograph series comprising seven editions, titled: &quot;Sketch #1&quot; through &quot;Sketch #7.&quot; That same year Serra begin to make larger-scale prints such as &quot;Malcolm X; Goslar,&quot; or &quot;The Moral Majority Sucks.&quot;

After pushing lithography to its limit, Serra began to work with silkscreen to produce a unique surface in his prints. He did so by first applying a layer of ink onto the paper. He then would apply a layer of paint stick through the second screen creating a saturated and textured surface.

Serra continued to work this his silkscreen technique, sometimes combining it with etching and aquatint. His print series include: &quot;Videy Afanger&quot; (1991); &quot;Hreppholer&quot; (1991); &quot;WM&quot; (1996); &quot;Rounds&quot; (1999); &quot;Venice Notebook&quot; (2001); &quot;Between the Torus and the Sphere&quot; (2006); &quot;Paths and Edges&quot; (2007); &quot;Level&quot; (2008); &quot;Junction&quot; (2010); &quot;Reversal&quot; (2015); &quot;Elevational Weight&quot; (2016); &quot;Equa&quot;l (2018); and (?) (2019).

===Films and video works===
From 1968 to 1979 Serra made a collection of films and videos. Although he began working with sculpture and film at the same time, Serra recognized the different material capacities of each and did not extend sculptural problems into his films and videos. Serra collaborated with several artists including Joan Jonas, Nancy Holt, and Robert Fiore, on his films and videos. His first films, &quot;Hand Catching Lead&quot; (1968), &quot;Hands Scraping&quot; (1968) &quot;and Hand Tied&quot; (1968) involve a series of actions: a hand tries to catch falling lead; pairs of hands move lead shavings; and bound hands untie themselves.

A later film &quot;Railroad Turnbridge&quot; (1976) frames the surrounding landscape of the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon, as the bridge turns. &quot;Steelmill/Stahwerk&quot; (1979), made in collaboration with the art historian Clara Weyergraf is divided in two parts. The first part is made up of interviews of German steel factory workers about their work. The second part captures the forging of Serra&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Berlin Block (for Charlie Chaplin).&quot;

Survey exhibitions and screenings of his films have been held at the Kunstmuseum Basel, Switzerland in 2017; Anthology Film Archives, New York, October 17–23, 2019; and Harvard Film Archive, January 27 – February 9, 2020. In 2019, Serra donated his entire film and video works to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

<text>Giovanni Battista Viotti (12 May 1755 – 3 March 1824) was an Italian violinist whose virtuosity was famed and whose work as a composer featured a prominent violin and an appealing lyrical tunefulness. He was also a director of French and Italian opera companies in Paris and London. He personally knew Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven.

==Biography==
Viotti was born at Fontanetto Po in the Kingdom of Sardinia (today in the province of Vercelli, Piedmont, Italy). For his musical talent, he was taken into the household of principe Alfonso dal Pozzo della Cisterna in Turin, where he received a musical education that prepared him to be a pupil of Gaetano Pugnani. He served at the Savoia court in Turin, 1773–80, then toured as a soloist, at first with Pugnani, before going to Paris alone, where he made his début at the Concert Spirituel, 17 March 1782. He was an instant sensation and served for a time at Versailles before founding a new opera house, the Théâtre de Monsieur in 1788, under the patronage of Louis-Stanislas-Xavier, comte de Provence, the king&#x27;s brother, whose court title was Monsieur. There he mounted operas of his friend Luigi Cherubini, among lesser lights. When the French Revolution took a radical turn and, though his opera house was renamed the Théâtre Feydeau, former royal connections became a dangerous liability, he moved in 1792 to London, making his début at Johann Peter Salomon&#x27;s Hanover Square Concert, 7 February 1793. In London he went from success to success, as a featured violinist for Salomon&#x27;s concert series, 1793–1794; as musical director of the new Opera Concerts in 1795; as a star in the benefit concerts for Haydn, 1794 and 1795; as acting manager of Italian opera at the King&#x27;s Theatre, 1794–1795; and as leader and director of the orchestra, 1797. He was invited to perform in the houses of the London &quot;bon ton&quot;, including for the Prince of Wales.

Then, with Britain at war with Revolutionary France, he was ordered to leave the country, under suspicion of Jacobin sympathies. Period papers hint at an intrigue in the favour of Viotti&#x27;s rival, Wilhelm Cramer, who had led the Opera House orchestra before Viotti took over. The &quot;Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Gazetteer&quot; in its issue of Friday, 9 March 1798, reported that &quot;the Duke of L... and the Earl of C... have been particularly active in entreating his Majesty to order Viotti out of the kingdom&quot;. This may refer to Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds, and to Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield. Pierre Rode, Viotti&#x27;s favourite pupil, was expelled from England, too, and may have left the country some days previous to Viotti who awaited the outcome of his case, after several gentlemen and even Princess Elizabeth spoke in his favour. But finally, Viotti left England with a packet ship on 8 March 1798. He lived on the estate of a rich English merchant, John Smith, in Schenefeld (Pinneberg) near Hamburg from ca. March 1798 to ca. July 1799. Between March and May 1798 he gave private lessons to the 13-year-old virtuoso Friedrich Wilhelm Pixis. After that, according to two papers issued in February 1800, he seems to have lived incognito on the estate of his English friends, William and Margaret Chinnery, at Gillwell House, where he lived officially from 1801; according to another paper he was still in Schenefeld in April 1800. He gave up giving concerts to run a wine business, but used to play in private concerts. In July 1811, he became a naturalised British citizen, after his friend, the Duke of Cambridge, a younger brother of the Prince of Wales, had interceded on his behalf. In 1813, he was one of the founders of the Philharmonic Society of London. Viotti didn&#x27;t perform as a soloist anymore but as orchestra leader and chamber musician. After his wine business failed, he returned to Paris to work as director of the Académie Royale de Musique, from 1819 to 1821. He returned to London in November 1823 together with Margaret Chinnery and died in her presence on 3 March 1824.

==Music==
In spite of his few direct pupils, Viotti was a very influential violinist. The teacher of both Pierre Rode and Pierre Baillot and an important influence on Rodolphe Kreutzer, all of whom became notable teachers themselves, he is considered the founding father of the 19th-century French violin school. He also taught Paul Alday and August Duranowski, who was an influence on Niccolò Paganini.

Viotti owned a violin fabricated by Antonio Stradivari in 1709 that would eventually become known as the &quot;Viotti Stradivarius&quot;. He is also thought to have commissioned the construction of at least one replica of this violin. The &quot;Viotti ex-Bruce&quot;, renamed in honour of its previous owner, was purchased by the Royal Academy of Music in September 2005. Funding was provided by HM Government in lieu of Inheritance Tax, and by the National Art Collections Fund, the National Heritage Memorial Fund and many private donors. The instrument was to be displayed in the York Gate Collections, the academy&#x27;s free museum and research centre. The &quot;Viotti ex-Bruce&quot; is to be heard as well as seen: the instrument is to be played sparingly, under very controlled circumstances, at research events and occasional performances elsewhere.

Viotti&#x27;s most notable compositions are his 29 violin concertos, which were an influence on Ludwig van Beethoven. One in particular, No. 22 in A minor (1792), is still very frequently performed, especially by advanced student players. The other concertos are of similar quality but lesser known. Other notable concertos include: No. 23 in G major (1792). During the 1990-2000 decade, Guido Rimonda found three more concertos. However, these discoveries – that can be regarded as concertos No. 30, 31 and 32 - are incomplete, since only two movements were found for each concerto. Most likely they are the unpublished concertos mentioned by Viotti himself in his will left in favour of Mrs. Chinnery who cared for him in London, in the last years of his life.

In 2005, violinist Franco Mezzena released a complete set on the Dynamic label. Since 2012 Guido Rimonda started releasing Viotti&#x27;s 32 concertos for Decca Universal Group label. This project will be completed by the end of 2023. In the meantime, in 2021, Guido Rimonda started the first publishing of Viotti&#x27;s complete scores of violin concertos for Edizioni Curci Milan.

Viotti&#x27;s music generally features the violin prominently. Most of his string quartets largely ignore the balanced texture pioneered by Haydn, giving a &quot;solo&quot; role to the first violin and as such may be considered &quot;Quatuors brillants&quot;. However, his &quot;Tre Quartetti Concertanti&quot;, G.112, 113 and 114 (after Remo Giazotto who catalogued Viotti&#x27;s works), composed in 1815 and published in Paris in 1817, are true concertante works offering extensive solos for each instrument and not just the first violin. Viotti often wrote chamber music for more traditional combinations such as two violins and cello. The Opp. 18 and 19 are perhaps the best known of these and are still in print today. He also wrote sonatas, songs, and other works.

The Italian violinist Guido Rimonda has pointed out in 2013 that the incipit of his &quot;Tema e variazioni in Do maggiore&quot; has a very strong resemblance to the French hymn La Marseillaise. This incipit was first thought to have been published before La Marseillaise, but it appeared to be a misconception as Viotti published several variations of &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; in 1795 and wrote as a note &quot;I have never composed the quartets below&quot; ().

== Cultural references ==
Viotti is commemorated annually in the Viotti International Music Competition near his birthplace in Vercelli, Italy. In the same city takes place also the Viotti Festival - International Music Festival - an event that is part of the circuit &quot;Piemonte dal Vivo&quot; Italy.

<text>Joseph-Armand Bombardier (; April 16, 1907 – February 18, 1964) was a Canadian inventor and businessman who was the founder of Bombardier. His most famous invention was a snowmobile.

==Biography==
Born in Valcourt, Quebec, Joseph-Armand Bombardier dabbled in mechanics from an early age. He built his first snow vehicle at the age of 15. He acquired experience by reading, taking notes and repairing what he found until he opened his own garage at age 19, where he would repair cars and sell gasoline in the summertime.

During wintertime, he worked on developing a vehicle able to travel on snow. At that time, the Quebec government did not clear snow from secondary roads, so residents of these areas stored their cars for the winter season. The idea to build a winter vehicle came to Bombardier after a blizzard in which his young son fell ill from peritonitis and died because he could not be brought to the nearest hospital.

The first B7 (B for Bombardier and 7 for 7 passengers) snowmobiles were sold during the winter of 1936–37 and were well received. A new plant able to produce more than 200 vehicles a year was built in 1940. A new 12-passenger model was made available in 1941 which was referred to as the B12, but demand was halted when Canada entered World War II. The B12 was manufactured by L’Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée. Bombardier also brought to market a C18 which served the public as a school bus. Over 3,000 units of the B12/C18 were manufactured. Bombardier offered his expertise to the Canadian government and started producing specialized military vehicles for the Allies. Bombardier also produced specialized vehicles for logging and mining operations, which they called the Muskeg.

After the war, business declined when the Quebec government began clearing snow from secondary roads in 1948. Bombardier went on to build smaller snowmobiles during the 1950s and developed a new market for recreational products for one or two people. In 1959 he launched the Ski-Doo, which was originally planned to be called Ski-Dog but a printing accident spelt it as Ski-Doo and Bombardier considered that typo a fortuitous development for a new trademark for his company. The Ski-Doo was ranked 17th place on CBC Television&#x27;s The Greatest Canadian Invention in 2007. Bombardier died in 1964 of cancer but the snowmobile idea was a success. 225 units were sold during 1959 and more than 8,210 units were sold during 1963.

==Honours==
In 2004, Autoroute 55 in Quebec was named &#x27; between Stanstead and Autoroute 20 (&#x27;) near Drummondville. The Bombardier Glacier in Antarctica is also named after him.

In 2000, Joseph-Armand Bombardier was honoured by the government of Canada with his image on a postage stamp.

He is a member of the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame.

<doc id="518600" wikidata="Q7777067" url="?curid=518600" title="Man on the Clapham omnibus">
<text>The man on the Clapham omnibus is a hypothetical ordinary and reasonable person, used by the courts in English law where it is necessary to decide whether a party has acted as a reasonable person would – for example, in a civil action for negligence. The character is a reasonably educated, intelligent but nondescript person, against whom the defendant&#x27;s conduct can be measured.

The term was introduced into English law during the Victorian era, and is still an important concept in British law. It is also used in other Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, sometimes with suitable modifications to the phrase as an aid to local comprehension. The route of the original &quot;Clapham omnibus&quot; is unknown but London Buses route 88 was briefly branded as &quot;the Clapham Omnibus&quot; in the 1990s and is sometimes associated with the term.

==History==
The phrase was reportedly first put to legal use in a judgment by Sir Richard Henn Collins MR in the English Court of Appeal libel case &quot;McQuire v. Western Morning News&quot; (1903). He attributed the phrase to Lord Bowen and used it in a negative sense:
It may be derived from the phrase &quot;Public opinion ... is the opinion of the bald-headed man at the back of the omnibus&quot;, a description by the 19th-century journalist Walter Bagehot of a normal London man. Clapham, in South London, was at the time a nondescript commuter suburb seen to represent &quot;ordinary&quot; London, and in the 19th century would have been served by horse-drawn omnibuses.

Lord Justice Greer used the phrase in &quot;Hall v. Brooklands Auto-Racing Club&quot; (1933) to define the standard of care a defendant must live up to in order to avoid being found negligent.

The use of the phrase was reviewed by the UK Supreme Court in &quot;Healthcare at Home Limited v. The Common Services Agency&quot; (2014), where Lord Reed said:
==Other related common law jurisdictions==

The expression has also been incorporated in Canadian patent jurisprudence, notably &quot;Beloit v. Valmet Oy&quot; in its discussion of the test for obviousness.

In Australia, the &quot;Clapham omnibus&quot; expression has inspired the New South Wales and Victorian equivalents, &quot;the man on the Bondi tram&quot; (a now disused tram route in Sydney), &quot;the man on the Bourke Street tram&quot; (Melbourne), and &quot;the ordinary person on the Belconnen omnibus&quot; (Canberra).

In Hong Kong, the equivalent expression is &quot;the man on the Shau Kei Wan tram&quot;.

<text>This is a list of 21st-century classical composers, sortable by name, year of birth and year of death.

The list includes composers who have made classical music since 2001. The 21st century is defined by the calendar rather than by any unifying characteristics of musical style or attitude, and is therefore not an era of the same order as the classical or romantic. However, the century to date can be considered a continuation of the postmodern era that began during the 20th century and differs from the earlier modernist era in matters of attitude more than style.

<text>Long Island University (LIU) is a private university in Brooklyn and Brookville, New York, United States. The university enrolls over 16,000 students and offers over 500 academic programs at its main campuses, LIU Brooklyn and LIU Post on Long Island, in addition to non-residential locations and online. The LIU Sharks athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I as a Northeast Conference member. LIU hosts and sponsors the annual George Polk Awards in journalism.

==History==
===20th century===
LIU was chartered in 1926 in Brooklyn, by the New York State Education Department to provide &quot;effective and moderately priced education&quot; to people from &quot;all walks of life.&quot; LIU Brooklyn is located in Downtown Brooklyn, at the corner of Flatbush and DeKalb Avenues. The main building adjoins the 1920s movie house Paramount Theatre; the building retains much of the original decorative detail and a fully operational Wurlitzer organ. The campus consists of nine academic buildings; a recreation and athletic complex that includes Division I regulation athletic fields; one on-campus and two nearby residential buildings; and an adjoining parking facility.

The campus is home to the university&#x27;s oldest school, the Arnold &amp; Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, founded in 1891 as the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy, and LIU Global, a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree program that allows students to live and study internationally in eight countries across eight semesters.

The LIU athletic teams, the Sharks, compete at the NCAA Division I level The university sponsors the George Polk Awards for excellence in journalism, and hosts and manages the Kumble Theater for the Performing Arts.

In 1951, in response to a growing number of families moving to the suburbs, LIU purchased an estate known as Hillwood from cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post and her third husband Joseph E. Davies. Located in Brookville on Long Island&#x27;s Gold Coast, the original home, Warburton Hall, was built by William A. Prime and was extensively renovated by Marjorie and her second husband Edward F. Hutton. Three years later, the campus was renamed C. W. Post, in honor of Marjorie Post&#x27;s father C. W. Post, a pioneering food entrepreneur.

===21st century===
In 2012, the university renamed all campuses. C. W. Post is now LIU Post, the university&#x27;s largest campus, at 307 acres (125 hectares) of historic 1920s mansions, gardens, athletic fields, art studios and performing arts space, broadcast television and radio stations, an on-campus sustainable energy facility, and the only on-campus equestrian facility on Long Island. LIU Post was home to the NCAA Division II LIU Post Pioneers and is the site of the Tilles Center for the Performing Arts. The school introduced its first online degree plan in 2004.

In March 2013, LIU named Kimberly R. Cline the university&#x27;s tenth president. She is the first woman to lead the private, six-campus institution.

====2016–17 lockout====
Cline outsourced the work of two groups of previously unionized workers on campus, and oversaw the lockout of 400 faculty on the day prior to the beginning of the 2016–17 school year.

On September 1, 2016, three days after the union&#x27;s contract expired and five days before the union was due to vote on the new contract, the university cut off the affected staff&#x27;s email accounts and health insurance, and told them they would be replaced. This is the first time that a college or university in the United States has used a lockout against its faculty members, according to William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions.

Following the lockout, the American Association of University Professors released a statement that it &quot;deplores this action and supports the right of the LIU Brooklyn faculty to collectively bargain in good faith with its administration,&quot; and urged the LIU administration to resume negotiations. In the first week of the autumn term, some students at LIU Brooklyn staged a walkout in support of the locked-out teaching staff.

With the 236 full-time faculty members and 450 adjuncts locked out, classes were taught by university administrators and temporary staff, and students reported inadequate instruction. The lockout ended on September 14 with an agreement to continue the expired contract until May 31, 2017, and resume negotiations with a mediator.

====COVID-19 pandemic====
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Long Island University moved all classes to online instruction for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester. Following a stay-at-home order from then-Governor Andrew Cuomo directing all non-essential businesses to work remotely, administrative and academic offices began operating virtually and LIU fired or furloughed employees whose work was perceived as non-amenable to working remotely, including 84 of 98 unionized employees.

Instruction in Summer 2020 was conducted online and LIU began offering in-person instruction again beginning September 8, 2020, with online options for people unable to attend lectures. Following the Thanksgiving recess, all instruction became online, with LIU resuming in-person instruction starting on February 1, 2021, at the start of the spring semester.

==Organization==
LIU is administered by a president and a 27-member board of trustees who elect the president.

===College of Veterinary Medicine===
The Vet School&#x27;s inaugural class began instruction in fall 2020. At the time of its founding, there were only 30 vet colleges in the United States. For over 150 years, the only vet school in the state was the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. However, political pressure grew for a second school in the New York City area. In May 2018, New York State granted $12 million to LIU to develop a vet school. Pre-clinical instruction is based in Brentwood, NY. Instead of developing its own veterinary hospital, LIU&#x27;s clinical programs are taught at existing veterinary hospitals and practices. The LIU Vet School has received a provisional accreditation and will award its first DVM degrees in 2024.

===Other LIU locations===
LIU Brentwood offers undergraduate and/or graduate programs in education, special education, literacy, mental health counseling, school counseling, psychology, criminal justice, and nursing.

LIU Hudson offers graduate and advanced certificate programs in business, public administration, pharmaceutics, education (early childhood, childhood, literacy, special education, and TESOL), educational leadership, school counseling, school psychology, mental health counseling, and marriage and family therapy.

LIU Riverhead is home to the Homeland Security Management Institute, which offers homeland security training. The institute has been designated a &quot;Homeland Security Center of Excellence&quot; by the United States Congress. Programs are also available in education, special education, literacy, communication studies, new media, cyber security, applied behavior analysis, and TESOL.

==Ranking==
In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked LIU 359th among National Universities.

==Athletics==
On October 3, 2018, Long Island University announced that it was unifying the athletic programs of its two campuses into one Division I program, effective with the 2019–20 academic year. The new program&#x27;s nickname of Sharks was announced on May 15, 2019. The Sharks retain the Brooklyn campus&#x27;s affiliation in the Northeast Conference.

The Sharks added two completely new women&#x27;s sports effective in 2019–20. Shortly before the athletic merger was announced, LIU Brooklyn announced that it would add women&#x27;s ice hockey; that sport will carry over to the unified program. Shortly after the merger announcement, LIU announced it would add women&#x27;s water polo, placing that sport in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference.

==Media==
LIU Public Radio, WCWP, broadcasts on 88.1.

LIU Brooklyn&#x27;s student newspaper is &quot;Seawanhaka&quot;, and LIU Post&#x27;s student newspaper is &quot;The Tide&quot;.

<doc id="518611" wikidata="Q7383344" url="?curid=518611" title="The Rutherford Institute">
<text>The Rutherford Institute is a public interest law firm dedicated to the defense of civil liberties, human rights, and religious liberties. Based in Charlottesville, Virginia, the non-profit organization&#x27;s motto is &quot;It&#x27;s our job to make the government play by the rules of the Constitution.&quot; The organization was founded in 1982 by John W. Whitehead, who continued to be its president . The Rutherford Institute offers free legal services to those who have had their rights threatened or violated. The Rutherford Institute has a network of affiliate attorneys across the United States and funds its efforts through donations. In addition to its offer of legal services, the organization offers free educational materials for those interested in the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.

While once primarily concerned with the defense of religious liberties, the organization later expanded its mission to encompass other constitutional issues such as search and seizure, free speech, and zero tolerance policy. Some of the institute&#x27;s legal actions were widely reported, including helping Paula Jones pursue a sexual harassment lawsuit in 1997 against President Bill Clinton, and its defense of middle and high school students suspended and expelled under inflexible zero tolerance policies, and the free speech rights of preachers and political protestors. Declaring that we live in a police state where &quot;freedom has become fascism&quot;, the institute has denounced no-knock warrants and granting police qualified immunity. It also defended state laws banning homosexual conduct in Bowers v. Hardwick.

The Rutherford Institute has worked with a number of similar groups across the political spectrum, including the ACLU and the Cato Institute. Whitehead was described by jazz historian and civil libertarian Nat Hentoff as &quot;this nation&#x27;s Paul Revere of protecting civil liberties.&quot;

== Foundation ==
The Rutherford Institute was named after Samuel Rutherford, a 17th-century theologian who wrote a book, &quot;Lex, Rex&quot;, which challenged the concept of the divine right of kings. When The Rutherford Institute was founded, conservative Protestants in the United States were reconsidering their role in American political and legal life, perceiving that the federal government was intent on encroaching on Americans&#x27; religious liberties. Organizations such as The Rutherford Institute pursued matters of religious liberties in the courts, and The Rutherford Institute became the model for groups such as the National Legal Foundation, the Liberty Counsel, and the American Center for Law and Justice. Bryan McKenzie of the &quot;Charlottesville Daily Progress&quot; described the institute as &quot;a more conservative American Civil Liberties Union&quot; (ACLU).

== History and legal actions ==
Since its founding, The Rutherford Institute has expanded its aims from defending the religious liberties of Christians to include defending the religious liberties of all Americans, as well as working to preserve rights such as free speech and the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure. However, the institute has sometimes taken pro-government positions, such as defending laws which banned gay sex.

=== Religious liberty ===
In 2004, the group filed a lawsuit against Muskogee Public Schools in Oklahoma on behalf of Nashala Hearn, an 11-year-old Muslim student who was suspended for wearing a religious headscarf to school.

In 2007, they filed a lawsuit against Freehold Township, New Jersey on behalf of an Orthodox rabbi, Avraham Bernstein, alleging that the town was persecuting Bernstein for holding prayer meetings in his home on the Sabbath.

In 2011, the group took up the cause of Laura George, founder of the Oracle Institute, who wanted to build a &quot;Peace Pentagon&quot;, a proposed interfaith study center and retreat, on the banks of the New River in Independence, Virginia. After George was refused a building permit when the local Board of Supervisors voted to deny the project on health, safety and welfare grounds, attorneys acting on behalf of The Rutherford Institute pursued a legal action to acquire the permit, alleging religious discrimination; eventually the building permit was granted.

=== Freedom of speech ===
In 2012, The Rutherford Institute filed a lawsuit on behalf of Harold Hodge, a man arrested in January 2011 for standing outside the United States Supreme Court Building carrying a sign which read, &quot;The U.S. Gov allows police to illegally murder and brutalize African-Americans and Hispanic people.&quot; Other cases include defending an Albemarle High School student&#x27;s right to wear a National Rifle Association T-shirt to school and contesting the dismissal of a California teacher who referred to &quot;Zionist Jews&quot; during an Occupy Movement protest.

The Rutherford Institute was also involved with the ACLU in defending the 2017 Unite the Right rally effort to hold a rally on August 11 and 12 in Charlottesville&#x27;s Emancipation Park.

=== Opposition to Government surveillance ===
In 2012, The Rutherford Institute took legal action against the Northside Independent School District in San Antonio, Texas, on behalf of high school student, Andrea Hernandez, who risked consequences from school administrators for refusing to wear a &quot;name badge containing a radio-frequency identification (RFID) chip.&quot; The school district sought to increase student attendance rates with tracking devices on students. Attorneys for the Rutherford Institute argued that the school&#x27;s actions violated Texas&#x27; Religious Freedom Act, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After the lawsuit in federal court and the negative publicity it generated, the Northside Independent School District abandoned the tracking program.

In 2023, The Rutherford Institute urged the City Council in Charlottesville, Virginia against adopting the use of license plate readers in the Charlottesville Police Department. 

In 2023, The Rutherford Institute issued a public warning about Ancestry.com DNA Kits and the &quot;associated privacy risks posed by police and hackers.&quot; John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute said “The debate over genetic privacy—and when one’s DNA becomes a public commodity outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches and seizures—is really only beginning,” 

=== Search and seizure ===
In 2008, The Rutherford Institute joined a coalition of civil libertarians and activists who called upon President George W. Bush to release a number of Muslim Uighurs who were being detained indefinitely in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

In 2010, the group took on a number of cases regarding the Transportation Security Administration&#x27;s controversial security procedures at American airports. The organization filed a lawsuit in November 2010 against Janet Napolitano, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and John Pistole, the head of the Transportation Security Administration, on behalf of airline pilots Michael Roberts and Ann Poe. The pilots objected to being subjected to &quot;whole body imaging&quot; scanners, which reveal the nude body of the subject being searched, as well as a pat-down. John W. Whitehead said of the matter, &quot;Forcing Americans to undergo a virtual strip search as a matter of course in reporting to work or boarding an airplane when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing is a grotesque violation of our civil liberties.&quot; The next month The Rutherford Institute filed another lawsuit on the behalf of three passengers who took issue with the TSA screening procedures: a 12-year-old girl placed in a body scanner without parental consent, a man who was subjected to an invasive pat down in his genital area due to an abnormality caused by a childhood injury, and a woman who had undergone a mastectomy and was required to be patted down in her breast area.

In 2010, Whitehead sent a letter to Ken Cuccinelli, the Attorney General of Virginia, decrying his legal opinion that school officials could seize and search student cellphones and laptop computers upon suspicion that a student had broken school rules or the law.

In 2011, the group filed a friend of the court brief in the case &quot;U.S. v. Jones&quot;, imploring the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that the placement of a GPS tracking device on the defendant&#x27;s car without first obtaining a warrant constituted an illegal search. In January 2012 the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant before placing a physical GPS tracking unit on a suspect&#x27;s car.

Following the 2020 Anti-police protests over the murder of George Floyd, but without mentioning it, Rutherford published an article denouncing no knock warrants and the granting of &quot;qualified immunity&quot; to police. The article argued that Americans live in a &quot;police state&quot; and that &quot;freedom has become fascism&quot; due to the Supreme Court&#x27;s refusal to uphold the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and limit the police, stating that there is a &quot;nationwide epidemic of court-sanctioned police violence carried out with impunity against individuals posing little or no real threat.&quot;

=== Ballot access ===
In July 2014, The Rutherford Institute supported the Libertarian Party of Virginia and alleged that Virginia ballot laws favored &quot;the election chances of Democrat and Republican candidates at the expense of Libertarian Party and independent candidates.&quot;

<doc id="518615" wikidata="Q1142862" url="?curid=518615" title="King Kong (1976 film)">
<text>King Kong is a 1976 American monster adventure film produced by Dino De Laurentiis and directed by John Guillermin. It is a modernized remake of the 1933 film about a giant ape that is captured and taken to New York City for exhibition. It stars Jeff Bridges, Charles Grodin, and Jessica Lange in her first film role, and features mechanical effects by Carlo Rambaldi and makeup effects by Rick Baker who also played the title character. It is the fifth entry in the &quot;King Kong&quot; franchise.

The idea to remake &quot;King Kong&quot; was conceived by Michael Eisner, who was then an ABC executive, in 1974. He separately proposed the idea to Universal Pictures CEO Sidney Sheinberg and Paramount Pictures CEO Barry Diller. Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis quickly acquired the film rights from RKO-General and subsequently hired television writer Lorenzo Semple Jr. to write the script. John Guillermin was hired as director and filming lasted from January to August 1976. Before the film&#x27;s release, Universal Pictures sued De Laurentiis and RKO-General alleging breach of contract, and attempted to develop their own remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. In response, De Laurentiis and RKO-General filed separate countersuits against Universal Pictures, all of which were withdrawn by January 1976.

The film was released on December 17, 1976, to mixed reviews from film critics while being a modest success at the box office. It won a noncompetitive Special Achievement Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, and it was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Of the three &quot;King Kong&quot; main films, it is the only one to feature the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building. A sequel titled &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; was released in 1986, with Guillermin directing once again.

==Plot==

In the 1970s, Fred Wilson, an executive of the Petrox Oil Company, forms an expedition based on infrared imagery which reveals a previously undiscovered Indian Ocean island hidden by a permanent cloud bank. Wilson believes the island has a huge deposit of oil. Jack Prescott, a primate paleontologist, sneaks onto the expedition&#x27;s vessel and attempts to warn the team against traveling to the island, citing an ominous final message about &quot;the roar of the greatest beast&quot; from previous doomed explorers. Wilson orders Prescott locked up, assuming that he is a spy from a rival corporation. Wilson eventually makes Prescott the expedition&#x27;s photographer. The ship happens upon a life raft which carries the beautiful and unconscious Dwan. Upon waking, Dwan tells Prescott that she is an aspiring actress who was aboard a director&#x27;s yacht which suddenly exploded. During the rest of the ship&#x27;s voyage, Prescott and Dwan become attracted to each other.

Upon arriving at the island, the team discovers a primitive tribe of indigenous people who live within the confines of a gigantic wall, built to protect them from a mysterious god known as Kong. The team finds that while there is a large deposit of oil, it is of such low quality that it is unusable. Later, while Dwan is on a raft, the natives kidnap her and take her back to the island where they drug her and offer her as a sacrifice to Kong. The monumental ape grabs Dwan from the altar and departs back into the jungle.

Although an awesome and terrifying sight, the soft-hearted Kong quickly becomes tamed by Dwan, whose rambling monologue calms and fascinates the monstrous beast. After she falls in the mud, Kong takes Dwan back to a waterfall to wash herself, and then uses great gusts of his warm breath to dry her.

In the meantime, Prescott and First Mate Carnahan lead a rescue mission to save Dwan. The rescue party encounters Kong while crossing a log bridge over a ravine, and Kong rolls the huge log, sending Carnahan and the rest of the sailors falling to their deaths, leaving Prescott and Boan as the only survivors. Trapped on opposite sides of the ravine, Prescott pursues Kong while Boan returns to the others to warn them. Kong takes Dwan to his lair. A giant snake appears and attempts to eat Dwan, but Kong battles and kills it while Prescott escapes with Dwan. Kong chases them back to the native village, only to fall into a pit trap and be smothered with chloroform.

Without any of the promised new oil, Wilson decides to transport Kong to America as a promotional gimmick for his company. When they finally reach New York City, Kong is put on display in a Beauty and the Beast farce, bound in chains with a large crown on his head. When Kong sees a group of reporters crowding around Dwan, hoping for interviews, the ape thinks it&#x27;s an assault on Dwan and breaks free of his bonds and goes on a rampage throughout the city. In the commotion, Wilson is killed when Kong steps on him. The ape also destroys an elevated train in his search for Dwan. Prescott and Dwan flee across the Queensboro Bridge to Manhattan while Kong pursues them. Prescott calls the military and in return for a promise that Kong will be captured unharmed, he tells them that Kong will climb the World Trade Center, which resembles a mountain on his native island. Kong locates Dwan and takes her; he begins to make his way to the World Trade Center, with Jack and the military in hot pursuit.

In the climax, Kong climbs the South Tower of the World Trade Center. However, the military ignores Jack&#x27;s plea and uses deadly force against Kong. After being attacked by Marines with flamethrowers while standing on the roof, Kong leaps across to the North Tower. There he is shot hundreds of times by military helicopters while Dwan futilely tries to stop them. The fatally injured Kong falls from the roof to the World Trade Center plaza, where he dies from his injuries. A sea of photographers bombards the grieving and traumatized Dwan. The crowd is so big that Dwan cannot even get close to Jack. She stands still and is photographed relentlessly by reporters while Kong lies dead in a pool of blood and broken concrete.

==Cast==
==Production==

There are two different accounts for how the remake for &quot;King Kong&quot; came about. In December 1974, Michael Eisner, then an executive for ABC, watched the original film on television and struck on the idea for a remake. He pitched the idea to Barry Diller, the chairman and CEO of Paramount Pictures, who then enlisted veteran producer Dino De Laurentiis to work on the project. However, De Laurentiis claimed the idea to remake &quot;King Kong&quot; was solely his own when he saw a &quot;Kong&quot; poster in his daughter&#x27;s bedroom as he woke her up every morning. When Diller suggested doing a monster film with him, De Laurentiis proposed the idea to remake &quot;King Kong&quot;. Diller and De Laurentiis provisionally agreed that Paramount would pay half of the film&#x27;s proposed $12 million budget in return for the distribution rights in the United States and Canada if the former could purchase the film rights of the original film.

De Laurentiis later contacted his friend Thomas F. O&#x27;Neil, president of General Tire and RKO-General, who informed him that the film rights were indeed available. Later, De Laurentiis and company executive Frederic Sidewater entered formal negotiations with Daniel O&#x27;Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, who requested a percentage of the film&#x27;s gross. On May 6, 1975, De Laurentiis paid RKO-General $200,000 plus a percentage of the film&#x27;s gross. After finalizing the agreement with Paramount, De Laurentiis and Sidewater began meeting with foreign distributors and set the film&#x27;s release for Christmas 1976.

===Writing===
After moving his production company to Beverly Hills, De Laurentiis first met with screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr., who at the time was writing &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot;. Impressed with his work on the film, De Laurentiis contacted Semple about writing &quot;King Kong&quot;, to which Semple immediately signed on. During their collaboration on the project, De Laurentiis already had two ideas in mind—that the film would set in present-day and the climax would set on top of the newly constructed World Trade Center.

Because of the risen sophistication in audiences&#x27; tastes since the original film, Semple sought to maintain a realistic tone, but infuse the script with a sly, ironic sense of humor that the audiences could laugh at. Having settled on the mood, Semple retained the basic plotline and set pieces from the original film, but updated and reworked other elements of the story. Inspired by the then-ongoing energy crisis and a suggestion from his friend Jerry Brick, Semple changed the expedition to being mounted by Petrox Corporation, a giant petroleum conglomerate which suspected that Kong&#x27;s island has unrefined oil reserves. In its original story outline, Petrox would discover Kong&#x27;s island from a map hidden in the secret archives at the Vatican Library.

In a notable departure from the original film, Semple dropped the dinosaurs that are present with Kong on the island. The reasons for the dropped subplot was due to the increased attention on Kong and Dwan&#x27;s love story and financial reasons as De Laurentiis did not want to use stop-motion animation in the film. Nevertheless, a giant boa constrictor was incorporated into the film.

A fast writer, Semple completed a forty-page outline within a few days and delivered it in August 1975. While De Laurentiis was pleased with Semple&#x27;s outline, he expressed displeasure with the Vatican Library subplot, which was immediately dropped. It would later be replaced with Petrox discovering the island through obtained classified photos taken by a United States spy satellite. Within a month, the 140-page first draft incorporated the character of Dwan (who according to the script was originally named Dawn until she switched the two middle letters to make it more memorable), the updated rendition of Ann Darrow from the 1933 film. For its second draft, the script was reduced to 110 pages. The final draft was completed by December 1975.

===Casting===
Meryl Streep has said that she was considered for the role of Dwan, but was deemed too unattractive by producer Dino De Laurentiis. Dwan was also proposed to Barbra Streisand but she turned it down. The role eventually went to the unknown Jessica Lange, then a New York fashion model with no prior acting experience.

===Filming and special effects===

De Laurentiis first approached Roman Polanski to direct the picture, but he wasn&#x27;t interested. De Laurentiis&#x27;s next choice was director John Guillermin who had just finished directing &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974). Guillermin had been developing a version of &quot;The Hurricane&quot; when offered the job of &quot;King Kong&quot;.

Guillermin, who was known to have had outbursts from time to time on the set, got into a public shouting match with executive producer Federico De Laurentiis (son of producer Dino De Laurentiis). After the incident, De Laurentiis was reported to have threatened to fire Guillermin if he did not start treating the cast and crew better.

As part of the $16 million budget, De Laurentiis had his mind set on building a full-scale animatronic Kong. Italian special effect artist Carlo Rambaldi designed and built the mechanical Kong, which was 40 ft (12.2 m) tall and weighed 6 tons; he would later compare building it to &quot;the United States space program&quot; during the race to the moon. Glen Robinson oversaw the construction of Kong and the amalgam of aluminium, latex, horse tails and hydraulics. Rambaldi had also to devise separate mechanical hands with working fingers, which could be used to scoop up Jessica Lange in close-ups, and a man-sized ape suit for long shots. For the ape suit, Rambaldi collaborated with Rick Baker, who also wore it during the filming. According to Bahrenburg, five different masks were created by Rambaldi to convey various emotions. Separate masks were necessary, as there were too many cables and mechanics required for all the expressions to fit in one single mask. To complete the look of a gorilla, Baker wore contact lenses so his eyes would resemble those of a gorilla.

Rambaldi&#x27;s giant mechanical Kong cost £500,000 to create. Despite months of preparation, the final device proved to be impossible to operate convincingly, and during the August 1976 filming of Kong&#x27;s escape in New York, a hydraulic pipe inside the gorilla burst. As a result, it is only seen in a series of brief shots totaling less than 15 seconds, and the ape suit was used in most of the filming.

Baker was extremely disappointed in the final suit, which he felt was not at all convincing. He gives all the credit for its passable appearance to cinematographer Richard H. Kline. The only time that the collaboration of Baker and Rambaldi went smoothly was during the design of the mechanical Kong mask. Baker&#x27;s design and Rambaldi&#x27;s cable work combined to give Kong&#x27;s face a wide range of expression that was responsible for much of the film&#x27;s emotional impact. Baker gave much of the credit for its effectiveness to Rambaldi and his mechanics.

To film the scene where the &quot;Petrox Explorer&quot; finds Dwan in the life raft, Jessica Lange spent hours in a rubber raft in the freezing cold, drenched and wearing only a slinky black dress. Shooting of this scene took place in the channel between Los Angeles and Catalina Island during the last week in January 1976.

On one of the nights of filming Kong&#x27;s death at the World Trade Center, over 30,000 people showed up at the site to be extras for the scene. Although the crowd was well behaved, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (owner of the World Trade Center complex) became concerned that the weight of so many people would cause the plaza to collapse, and ordered the producers to shut down the filming. However, the film makers had already got the shot they wanted of the large crowd rushing toward Kong&#x27;s body. They returned to the site days later to finish filming the scene, with a much smaller crowd of paid extras.

The roar used for Kong was taken from the film &quot;The Land Unknown&quot; (1957).

==Music==
The film&#x27;s score was composed and conducted by John Barry. A soundtrack album of highlights from the score was released in 1976 by Reprise Records on LP. This album was reissued on CD, first as a bootleg by the Italian label Mask in 1998, and then as a legitimate, licensed release by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; in 2005. On October 2, 2012, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; released the complete score on a two-disc set; the first disc features the remastered complete score, while the second disc contains the remastered original album, along with alternate takes of various cues.

==Release==
===Distribution===
The film opened on December 17, 1976 in 974 theaters in the United States and Canada and was in 2,200 theaters worldwide on or immediately after December 17.

====Extended television version====
NBC bought the rights to air the movie from De Laurentiis for $19.5 million, which was the highest amount any network had ever paid for a film at that time. When &quot;King Kong&quot; made its television debut over two nights in September 1978, around 60 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make the film longer, and it had some added or replaced music cues. Additionally, to obtain a lower, family-friendly TV rating, overtly violent or sexual scenes in the theatrical version were trimmed down or replaced with less explicit takes, and all swearing or potentially offensive language was removed. Further broadcasts of the extended version followed in November 1980 and March 1983.

===Home media===
The theatrical version of the film has been released numerous times worldwide on all known home video formats. Of the DVDs, only a few European editions feature any notable extras; these include a 2005 &quot;Making Kong&quot; featurette (22:20) and up to 10 deleted scenes from the extended TV version (16:10). On May 11, 2021, the movie was released to Blu-ray in the United States and Canada courtesy of Shout! Factory-owned brand Scream Factory. The release includes both the theatrical and extended TV cuts.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;King Kong&quot; did not match Laurentiis&#x27; or studio expectations at the box office. Laurentiis claimed that the film would outgross the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; and Paramount expected it to gross $150 million. Despite the perceived failure, the film was highly profitable, earning back over triple its budget.

In the United States and Canada, &quot;King Kong&quot; opened at number one at the box office grossing $7,023,921 in its opening weekend which was Paramount&#x27;s biggest opening weekend at that time, and set the record for a December opening. However, it just failed to surpass the opening weekend set by &quot;Jaws&quot; of $7,061,053, despite being in double the number of theaters. Worldwide, it grossed within ten days from 1,500 of the 2,200 theaters it had opened in, including $18 million from the United States and Canada (compared to &quot;Jaws&quot;″ $21 million in the United States and Canada for the same period). The film went on to gross $52 million in the United States and Canada, and just over $90 million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film released in 1976 in the United States, and the third-highest-grossing film released in 1976 worldwide. As it was a year end release grossing the majority of its total in 1977, the film was included on &quot;Variety&quot;″s chart of the top domestic (U.S. and Canada) moneymakers of 1977 where it ended up at fifth place.

===Critical response===
Pauline Kael from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised the film, noting the &quot;movie is a romantic adventure fantasy—colossal, silly, touching, a marvelous Classics Comics movie (and for the whole family). This new &quot;Kong&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the magical primeval imagery of the first &quot;King Kong&quot;, in 1933, and it doesn&#x27;t have the Gustave Doré fable atmosphere, but it&#x27;s a happier, livelier entertainment. The first &quot;Kong&quot; was a stunt film that was trying to awe you, and its lewd underlay had a carnival hucksterism that made you feel a little queasy. This new &quot;Kong&quot; isn&#x27;t a horror movie—it&#x27;s an absurdist love story.&quot; Richard Schickel from &quot;Time&quot; wrote that &quot;The special effects are marvelous, the good-humored script is comic-bookish without being excessively campy, and there are two excellent performances&quot; from Charles Grodin and Kong. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;one of the most successful remakes in the brief (but remake-blotched) history of motion pictures. Faithful in substantial degree not only to the letter but also the spirit of the 1933 classic for RKO, this new version neatly balances superb special effects with solid dramatic credibility.&quot;

Vincent Canby, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, claimed the movie was &quot;inoffensive, uncomplicated fun, as well as a dazzling display of what special-effects people can do when commissioned to construct a 40-foot-tall ape who can walk, make fondling gestures, and smiles a lot.&quot; However, he was critical of the use of the World Trade Center instead of the Empire State Building during the climax, but he praised the performances by Bridges and Grodin and the special effects creation of Kong. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a spectacular film&quot; that &quot;for all its monumental scale retains the essential, sincere and simple charm of the beauty and the beast story.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; had a mixed reaction, giving the film two-and-a-half stars out of four as he wrote, &quot;The original &#x27;Kong&#x27; took itself seriously; and so, even now, 43 years later, do we. But the kidding around in the new film, though frequently amusing, knocks down the myth its special effects staff has so earnestly tried to build.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the remake &quot;moves along reasonably well as a half-jokey, half-serious contemporary &#x27;reading&#x27; of its predecessor; as an accomplishment in horror and fantasy adventure, it does not measure up to even the small toe of the original.&quot;

The movie&#x27;s success helped launch the career of Jessica Lange, although she reportedly received some negative publicity regarding her debut performance that, according to film reviewer Marshall Fine, &quot;almost destroyed her career&quot;. Although Lange won the Golden Globe Award for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture – Female for &quot;Kong&quot;, she did not appear in another film for three years and spent that time training intensively in acting.

Critical responses to &quot;King Kong&quot; continue to be mixed. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 51 reviews with an average rating of 5.1/10. The critical consensus reads that &quot;&quot;King Kong&quot; represents a significant visual upgrade over the original, but falls short of its classic predecessor in virtually every other respect.&quot; Metacritic, another aggregator, sampled 11 critics and calculated a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film received two Academy Award nominations and won one Special Achievement Award for its visual effects.
*Winner Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Glen Robinson and Frank Van der Veer), shared with &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1976).
*Nominee Best Cinematography (Richard H. Kline)
*Nominee Best Sound (Harry W. Tetrick, William McCaughey, Aaron Rochin and Jack Solomon).

===Controversy===
Before Michael Eisner pitched the idea of a remake of &quot;King Kong&quot; to Barry Diller, he had earlier mentioned the idea to Sidney Sheinberg, the CEO and president of MCA Inc./Universal Pictures. A short time later, Universal decided to purchase the property as an opportunity to showcase its new sound system technology, Sensurround, which had debuted with the disaster film &quot;Earthquake&quot;, for Kong&#x27;s roars. On April 5, 1975, Daniel O&#x27;Shea, a semi-retired attorney for RKO-General, had arranged meetings with Arnold Stane, attorney for MCA/Universal, and De Laurentiis and Sidewater for the film rights to &quot;King Kong&quot;. Neither side knew that a rival studio was also negotiating with RKO-General. Stane had negotiated for Universal an offer of $200,000 plus 5 percent of the film&#x27;s net profit. In contrast, De Laurentiis offered $200,000 plus 3 percent of the film&#x27;s gross—and 10 percent if the film recouped two and a half its negative cost. In May 1975, the film rights were granted to De Laurentiis.

In the wake of the agreement, Shane claimed that O&#x27;Shea had verbally accepted Universal&#x27;s offer, although no official paperwork was signed. O&#x27;Shea contested, &quot;I did not make any agreement written or oral ... never told him we had an agreement, nor words to that effect ... never told him that I had the authority ... I am not an employee, agent, or officer at RKO.&quot; A few days later, Universal filed suit against De Laurentiis and RKO-General in Los Angeles Superior Court for $25 million on charges of breach of contract, fraud, and intentional interference with advantageous business relations. In October 1975, Universal, which was in pre-production with its own remake with Hunt Stromberg, Jr. as producer and Joseph Sargent as director, filed suit in a federal district court arguing that the story&#x27;s &quot;basic ingredients&quot; were public domain. Universal had claimed that its remake was based on the two-part serialization by Edgar Wallace and a novelization by Delos W. Lovelace adapted from the screenplay that had been published shortly before the film&#x27;s release in 1933.

Universal started production on &quot;The Legend of King Kong&quot; on January 5, 1976, with Bo Goldman writing the screenplay based on the novelization by Lovelace. On November 20, RKO-General countersued Universal for $5 million alleging that &quot;The Legend of King Kong&quot; was an infringement on their copyright, and asked the court to prevent any &quot;announcements, representations, and statements&quot; on their proposed film. On December 4, De Laurentiis countersued for $90 million with charges of copyright infringement and &quot;unfair competition&quot;. In January 1976, both studios agreed to withdraw their legal suits filed against each other. Universal agreed to cancel &quot;The Legend of King Kong&quot;, but intended to proceed with a remake sometime in the future on the condition that it release at least eighteen months after De Laurentiis&#x27;s remake. In September 1976, a federal judge ruled in favor of Universal that Lovelace&#x27;s novelization had fallen into public domain, which cleared the studio to produce a remake. Universal later produced a remake, also titled &quot;King Kong&quot;, in 2005, although that film was allowed to use elements of the 1933 film (which is still under copyright) as a result of Universal being sold the film rights from the estate of Merian C. Cooper.

<text>A 527 organization or 527 group is a type of U.S. tax-exempt organization organized under Section 527 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (). A 527 group is created primarily to influence the selection, nomination, election, appointment or defeat of candidates to federal, state or local public office.

Technically, almost all political committees, including state, local, and federal candidate committees, traditional political action committees (PACs), &quot;Super PACs&quot;, and political parties are &quot;527s&quot;. However, in common practice the term is usually applied only to such organizations that are not regulated under state or federal campaign finance laws because they do not &quot;expressly advocate&quot; for the election or defeat of a candidate or party.

There are no upper limits on contributions to 527s and no restrictions on who may contribute. There are no spending limits imposed on these organizations. The organizations must register with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), publicly disclose their donors and file periodic reports of contributions and expenditures.

Because they may not expressly advocate for specific candidates or coordinate with any candidate&#x27;s campaign, many 527s are used to raise money to spend on issue advocacy and voter mobilization. Examples of 527s are Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, The Media Fund, America Coming Together, the Progress for America Voter Fund, and the Secretary of State Project.

==Legal history==

Internal Revenue Code section 527 was enacted as part of Public Law No. 93-625 on January 3, 1975. In the case of &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court attempted to draw a limit on the extent to which campaign finance laws could regulate speech about politics. The Court&#x27;s answer was that campaign finance laws could reach only party and candidate committees, organizations with the major purpose of electing candidates, or speech that &quot;expressly advocated&quot; the election or defeat of candidates. The determination of whether a group had the major purpose of electing candidates depended, in turn, on whether &quot;express advocacy&quot; was the group&#x27;s primary activity. In footnote 6 of the Buckley opinion, the Court limited &quot;express advocacy&quot; to words and phrases such as &quot;Smith for Congress&quot;, &quot;elect&quot;, &quot;defeat&quot;, or other specific calls for action to vote for or against a candidate. Thus, organizations could run ads discussing candidates and issues without being subject to campaign finance restrictions, so long as they avoided such express advocacy.

The McCain-Feingold law, also known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, extended certain campaign finance limitations to broadcast advertisements run within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary election if they mentioned a candidate, regardless of whether or not they contained &quot;express advocacy&quot;. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of this provision in &quot;McConnell v. Federal Election Commission&quot;. Based on that decision, many persons urged the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to use its regulatory power to extend campaign finance laws to cover these groups. The Commission held hearings in April 2004 to determine whether or not 527s should be regulated under campaign finance rules, but concluded that the law did not cover these independent 527 organizations unless they directly advocated the election or defeat of a candidate or engaged in broadcast advertising mentioning within the 30- and 60-day windows specified by Congress in the McCain-Feingold law. Nevertheless, Federal Election Commission rulings after the 2004 election attempted to extend the reach of the law to advertisements which questioned a candidate&#x27;s character and fitness for office off limits to 527s specifically.
* On September 18, 2009, the Federal Appeals Court in Washington, D.C., ruled that these groups have a First Amendment right to raise and spend freely to influence elections so long as they do not coordinate their activities with a candidate or a party.
* In January 2010, the Supreme Court held that the government may not keep corporations or unions from spending money to support or denounce individual candidates in elections. While corporations or unions may not give money directly to campaigns or coordinate their activity with campaigns, they may seek to persuade the voting public through independent expenditure groups.
* In July 2010, the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruling in Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission struck down fundraising limits on independent expenditure-only committees, (commonly known as Super PACs) which, like 527s, can raise unlimited amounts of money from individuals, unions, associations and corporations to influence elections. Speechnow.org v. Federal Election Commission, 599 F.3d 686, (U.S.C.A. D.C. 2010). These PACs must also disclose their finances to the FEC and cannot coordinate with candidates or political parties. The difference is that the Super PACs can &quot;expressly advocate&quot; for or against a candidate. The Speechnow.org and Citizens United decisions made 527s much less valuable as a medium of political communication, and their use declined substantially in the elections of 2010 and 2012 .

In &quot;Carey &quot;et al.&quot; v. FEC&quot; – RADM James J. Carey, USN (ret), chairman of the National Defense PAC, along with the PAC and a prospective donor, brought suit after the FEC deadlocked on a 2010 Advisory Opinion Request (see AO 2010-20), in which the PAC sought permission to operate both an independent expenditure PAC and a traditional PAC that could make contributions to candidates and was subject to fundraising restrictions. Carey&#x27;s victory in the court now allows organizations to operate both traditional and &quot;Super&quot; PACs.

==Public opinion==
A February 2010 poll from the Pew Research Center found that 68 percent of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision to allow corporations to make expenditures on behalf of candidates during elections. Seventeen percent approve of the expenditures, and 15 percent of respondents said they were unsure.

An October 2010 Bloomberg poll found that 47 percent of Americans say they would be less likely to support a political candidate if his campaign was supported by advertising paid for by anonymous business groups. According to the pollster, 41 percent said that it would not matter, and 9 percent said they would be more likely to back the candidate.

==2004 election controversy==
Although 527 organizations were in common use by the 1990s, in the wake of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which limited the ability of political parties to raise money, 527s rose to much greater prominence and visibility. Swift Boat was one such group, which ran controversial and highly effective ads critical of the 2004 Democratic Party candidate, John Kerry. A reported $9.45 million came from just 3 private individuals. On the liberal side, contributor George Soros contributed $23.7 million to 527s, and Peter Lewis of Progressive Insurance contributed another $23.2 million to 527s in 2004. Prominent 527s that supported Democrats included America Coming Together, MoveOn.org, and the Media Fund.

Under federal election law, coordination between an election campaign and a 527 group is not allowed. The heavy spending of key 527 groups to attack presidential candidates brought complaints to the Federal Elections Commission of illegal coordination between the groups and rival political campaigns. These formal complaints included:
* On May 5, 2004, the Republican National Committee accused MoveOn.org, The Media Fund, America Coming Together and America Votes of coordinating their efforts with the John Kerry campaign.
* On August 20, 2004, John Kerry&#x27;s campaign accused Swift Boat Veterans for Truth of coordinating their efforts with the George W. Bush campaign.

In 2006 and 2007 the FEC fined a number of organizations, including MoveOn and Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, for violations arising from the 2004 campaign. The FEC&#x27;s rationale was that these groups had specifically advocated the election or defeat of candidates, thus making them subject to federal regulation and its limits on contributions to the organizations.

<text>Guru Angad (31 March 1504 – 29 March 1552; , ) was the second of the ten Sikh gurus of Sikhism. After meeting Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, becoming a Sikh, and serving and working with Nanak for many years, Nanak gave Lehna the name Angad (&quot;my own limb&quot;), and chose Angad as the second Sikh Guru.

After the death of Guru Nanak in 1539, Guru Angad led the Sikh tradition. He is remembered in Sikhism for adopting and formalising the Gurmukhi alphabet. He began the process of compiling the hymns of Nanak and contributed 62 or 63 &quot;Saloks&quot; of his own. Instead of his own son, he chose his disciple Amar Das as his successor and the third Guru of Sikhism.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Guru Angad was born on 31 March 1504 with the birth name of Lehna (also transliterated as Lahina) in the village of Matte-di-Sarai (now Sarainaga) in Muktsar district of the Punjab region. He was the son of a small but successful trader named Pheru Mal. His mother&#x27;s name was Mata Ramo (also known as Mata Sabhirai, Mansa Devi and Daya Kaur). His grandfather was named Baba Narayan Das Trehan. Like all the Sikh Gurus, Lehna came from Khatri caste and specifically the Trehan gotra (clan).

At age 16, Lehna married a Khatri girl named Mata Khivi in January 1520. They had two sons, Datu (b. 1535) and Dasu (b. 1542), and one or two daughters, Amro (b. 1526) and Anokhi (b. 1535), depending on the primary sources. The entire family of his father had left their ancestral village in fear of the invasion of Babur&#x27;s armies. After this the family settled at Khadur Sahib, a village by the River Beas near what is now Tarn Taran.

Before becoming a disciple of Guru Nanak and following the Sikh way of life as Angad, Lehna was a religious teacher of Khadur and a priest at a temple dedicated to the goddess Durga. His family had also been worshipers of Durga. He also embarked on many religious pilgrimages. On one of these pilgrimages, he happened to pass by the settlement of Kartarpur, that had been established by Nanak, on the way to his ultimate destination. It is said that a dialogue then occurred there between Lehna and Nanak, in-which the former was left with a deeply positive impression of the latter. Thereafter, Lehna remained at Kartarpur for six years serving his newfound spiritual master.

Lehna in his late 20s sought out Guru Nanak, became his disciple, and displayed deep and loyal service to his Guru for about six to seven years in Kartarpur and renounced the Hindu way of life.

===Selection as successor===

Several stories in the Sikh tradition describe reasons why Lehna was chosen by Guru Nanak over his own sons as his choice of successor. One of these stories is about a jug which fell into mud, and Guru Nanak asked his sons to pick it up. Nanak&#x27;s sons would not pick it up because it was too dirty or menial a task. Then he asked Lehna, who however picked it out of the mud, washed it clean, and presented it to Nanak full of water. Lehna was selected as the successor of Guru Nanak on 14 June 1539 but his formal installation ceremony occurred later that year on 7 September 1539. Nanak touched him and renamed him Angad (from &quot;Ang&quot;, or part of the body) and named him as his successor and the second Guru on 7 September 1539.

After Guru Nanak died on 22 September 1539, Guru Angad unable to bear the separation from Nanak retired into a room in a disciple&#x27;s house in a state of Vairagya. Baba Buddha later discovered him after a long search and requested him to return for Guruship. The Gurbani uttered at the time, &quot;Die before the one whom you love, to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world&quot;.

Angad later left Kartarpur for the village of Khadur Sahib (near Goindwal Sahib). Post succession, at one point, very few Sikhs accepted Guru Angad as their leader while the sons of Nanak claimed to be the successors. Angad focused on the teachings of Nanak, and building the community through charitable works such as langar.

===Relationship with the Mughal Empire===
The second Mughal Emperor of India Humayun visited Guru Angad at around 1540 after Humayun lost the Battle of Kannauj, and thereby the Mughal throne to Sher Shah Suri. According to Sikh hagiographies, when Humayun arrived in Gurdwara Mal Akhara Sahib at Khadur Sahib, Angad was sitting and teaching children. The failure to greet the Emperor immediately angered Humayun. Humayun lashed out but the Guru reminded him that the time when you needed to fight when you lost your throne you ran away and did not fight and now you want to attack a person engaged in prayer. In the Sikh texts written more than a century after the event, Angad is said to have blessed the emperor, and reassured him that someday he will regain the throne.

===Death and successor===
Before his death, Guru Angad, following the example set by Guru Nanak, nominated Guru Amar Das as his successor. Amar Das was born into a Hindu family and had been reputed to have gone on some twenty pilgrimages into the Himalayas, to Haridwar on river Ganges. About 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met a &quot;sadhu&quot;, or ascetic, who asked him why he did not have a guru (teacher, spiritual counsellor) and Amar Das decided to get one. On his return, he heard Bibi Amro, the daughter of Angad who had married his brother&#x27;s son, singing a hymn by Nanak. Amar Das learnt from her about Guru Angad, and with her help met Angad in 1539, adopting Guru Angad as his spiritual Guru, who was much younger than his own age.

Amar Das displayed relentless devotion and service to Guru Angad. Sikh tradition states that he woke up in the early hours to fetch water for Angad&#x27;s bath, cleaned and cooked for the volunteers with the Guru, as well devoted much time to meditation and prayers in the morning and evening. Guru Angad named Amar Das as his successor in 1552. Guru Angad died on 29 March 1552.

==Influence==
===Gurmukhi script===

Guru Angad is credited in the Sikh tradition with the Gurmukhi script, which is now the standard writing script for Punjabi language in India, in contrast to Punjabi language in Pakistan where now a Perso-Arabic script called Shahmukhi is the standard. The original Sikh scriptures and most of the historic Sikh literature have been written in the Gurmukhi script.

Angad standardised and made improvements to the scripts of the region to create the Gurmukhi script. Examples of possible forerunners of the script including at least one hymn written in acrostic form by Guru Nanak, and its earlier history is yet to be fully determined.

Angad also wrote 62 or 63 Saloks (compositions), which together constitute about one percent of the Guru Granth Sahib, the primary scripture of Sikhism. Rather than contribute hymns, Angad&#x27;s importance was as a consolidator of Nanak&#x27;s hymns. Angad would also supervise the writing down of Nanak&#x27;s hymns by Bhai Paira Mokha and scrutinize the resulting compilation, preparing the way for a Sikh scripture, as well as the beginning of a vernacular Punjabi literature, as tradition holds that he may have also commissioned an account of Nanak&#x27;s life from earlier disciples. The collection of hymns would also be increasingly important for the expanding community.

===Langar and community work===
Guru Angad is notable for systematising the institution of langar in all Sikh gurdwara premises, where visitors from near and far could get a free simple meal in a communal seating. He also set the rules and training method for volunteers (&quot;sevadars&quot;) who operated the kitchen, placing emphasis on treating it as a place of rest and refuge, being always polite and hospitable to all visitors.

Angad visited other places and centres established by Guru Nanak for the preaching of Sikhism. He established new centres and thus strengthened its base.

===&quot;Mall Akhara&quot;===

Angad, being a great patron of wrestling, started a &quot;Mall Akhara&quot; (wrestling arena) system where physical exercises, martial arts, and wrestling was taught as well as health topics such as staying away from tobacco and other toxic substances. He placed emphasis on keeping the body healthy and exercising daily. He founded many such &quot;Mall Akharas&quot; in many villages including a few in Khandur. Typically the wrestling was done after daily prayers and also included games and light wrestling.

=== Biography of Nanak ===
It is said that Guru Angad commissioned the compiling of a biography covering the life of his predecessor, Guru Nanak. However, the identity of the work and whether or not it ever existed or even survives to the present-day, is debated. Some believe the Bhai Bala Vali tradition of the Janamsakhi literature was the biography on Nanak ordered by Angad.

<text>Popular, Inc., doing business as Banco Popular in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and as Popular Bank in the mainland United States, is a financial services conglomerate that has operated in Puerto Rico for over 125 years and in the mainland United States for over 52 years. In recent years, it has expanded into other areas of the Caribbean and Central America. The BPPR in the logo stands for Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, where the bank has its major historical footprint.

Popular, Inc. is the parent company of Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, Popular Bank, E-Loan, and several other companies.

The headquarters of Banco Popular Puerto Rico is in Hato Rey, San Juan.

==History==
The bank was founded in Puerto Rico in 1893 when the island was still under Spanish administration. It was led in its early stages by Rafael Carrión Sr. and Don Manuel Muñoz Barrios, the latter of which was the company&#x27;s first president and administrator.

During the 1970s, the company&#x27;s commercials were popular on Puerto Rican television: they presented a balding, middle aged man in a white tee shirt, announcing the company in a comic way. The 1970s also saw a giant step in the development of Banco Popular as Puerto Rico&#x27;s biggest bank, when it bought two-thirds of the Banco de Crédito y Ahorro Ponceño. Through this purchase, Popular entered the credit-card industry.

During the following decades, Banco Popular put great of emphasis on the company&#x27;s public image. It was during the 1980s, after Rafael Carrion, Sr.&#x27;s death, that Richard L. Carrión assumed the role as President of the corporation.

In 1989, the bank introduced a children&#x27;s savings service with a bear, &quot;Populoso&quot;, as its mascot. The &quot;Club del Ahorro&quot; (or Savings Club) was (and still is) intended to encourage children to open savings accounts and keep track of their money.

===1990s===
The following decade started with a big development for the bank, when in 1990 it merged with Banco de Ponce, one of the largest banks in Puerto Rico. At this time, Banco Popular&#x27;s holding company changed its name to BanPonce Corporation. Popular acquired Banco Roig, one of the main banks in the eastern side of the island, in 1997, entering a geographical market in which it had yet to succeed.

During the late 1990s, the company began to diversify its services thanks to revisions of state laws that allowed banks certain &#x27;privileges&#x27; related to different financial services other than banking. These years saw the birth of Popular Auto, Popular Finance, Popular Mortgage, Popular Insurance, Popular Leasing, among others.

During this time, the company created one of its flagship subsidiaries, Popular Securities. It quickly became the investment banking, retail brokerage, and institutional sales arm of Banco Popular. On the retail side, Popular Securities has an extensive network of brokers in Puerto Rico, rivaled only by Swiss giant UBS and more recently by Banco Santander. Popular Securities has additional offices in New York City, San Antonio, Houston, and Chicago.

===2000s===
Due to its growth in Puerto Rico, and the aggressive expansion in the United States, the company changed its name once again in 2000 to Popular, Inc., a name that goes back to the traditional roots of the corporation and which also reflects the common title in almost all of the subsidiaries of the company.

During this period, the company reorganized itself into three main subsidiary companies: Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with David Chafey Jr. as president; Popular Bank, with Roberto Herencia as president; and Evertec, with Felix Villamil as president. Richard Carrión remained as president and CEO of the parent company, Popular, Inc.

In the January 24, 2005 issue of &quot;Fortune&quot;, Popular, Inc. was chosen as one of the &quot;100 Best Companies to Work For&quot;.

On April 11, 2005, Popular Bank announced a five-year agreement with the New York Mets under which Popular would operate seven ATMs and display various advertisements at Shea Stadium until it closed in September 2008, and the team moved to the new Citi Field.

===Present===
Popular&#x27;s world headquarters are located in the San Juan&#x27;s Hato Rey business district, on a stretch of a thoroughfare commonly known as &quot;Milla de Oro&quot; (&quot;The Golden Mile&quot;) due to the number of banks headquartered in the area. Travelers who fly into the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport can appreciate Popular&#x27;s landmark building below.

Between 2010 and 2012, the bank re-branded its mainland branches as Popular Community Bank in an effort to attract more non-Hispanic customers. The first branches to bear the new name were in the Chicago market followed by those in Southern California and Florida, then New York City and New Jersey.

As of January, 2012, Popular, Inc. still owed $935 million to the US government Troubled Asset Relief Program.

In March 2013, Popular announced it would sell a $568 million portfolio of non-performing loans to a joint venture between Caribbean Property Group and funds affiliated with Perella Weinberg Partners.

In 2014, Popular Community Bank sold many of its mainland United States branches in Central Florida, Illinois and Southern California to cut costs and shore up its reserves against losses caused by foreclosures and the recession in Puerto Rico. After the sale, Popular Community Bank retained 49 branches in South Florida, New Jersey, and New York. On September 12, 2014, Harbor Community Bank purchased Popular&#x27;s branches in Orlando and central Florida. On November 7, 2014, Banc of California in Irvine purchased 20 branches of Popular Community Bank in southern California.

In 2018, Popular Community Bank changed its name to Popular Bank (Legal name) and Popular, commercial name.

<doc id="518656" wikidata="Q823140" url="?curid=518656" title="Hereditary coproporphyria">
<text>Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is a disorder of heme biosynthesis, classified as an acute hepatic porphyria. HCP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase, coded for by the &quot;CPOX&quot; gene, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, although homozygous individuals have been identified. Unlike acute intermittent porphyria, individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in porphyria cutanea tarda in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias. Like other porphyrias, attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs, environmental stressors or diet changes. Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect. Overall, porphyrias are rare diseases. The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1:20,000. The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine, due to its reduced penetrance.

==Signs and symptoms==
Clinically, patients affected with HCP present similarly to those with other acute porphyrias, such as acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and variegate porphyria (VP). Patients with HCP and VP can present with symptoms shared between the acute and cutaneous porphyrias. This includes the acute attacks of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension and seizures, as well as the cutaneous findings seen in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), namely increased skin fragility, bullous lesions after exposure to sunlight and increased scarring.

Individuals with HCP may be asymptomatic in the absence of triggering factors. Common triggers include certain drugs, alcohol, hormonal changes, and dietary changes. Sunlight and other ultraviolet light can trigger the skin manifestations. Homozygous individuals for &quot;CPOX&quot; mutations can present with these findings at an earlier age than heterozygotes.

==Genetics==
HCP is caused by mutations in &quot;CPOX&quot;, which codes for the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is responsible for the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, converting coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. &quot;CPOX&quot; is located at 3q11.2-q12.1, has 6 introns and 7 exons and produces an mRNA strand that is 2675 bases in length. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, meaning that a deficiency of 50% of the normal enzyme activity is enough to cause symptoms. As reproductive fitness is not impacted, homozygous affected individuals have been reported. Along with other acute porphyrias HCP demonstrates reduced penetrance, meaning not all individuals who carry a disease-causing mutation will express symptoms.

Individuals who are homozygous for a specific mutation (K404E) or compound heterozygous with a null allele in &quot;CPOX&quot; have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria, harderoporphyria, characterized by neonatal jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatosplenomegaly and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light. HCP is a rare disease, but the exact incidence is difficult to determine due to the reduced penetrance of the acute porphyrias. Overall, the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1:20,000 in the United States. The incidence of harderoporphyria is even lower, with less than 10 cases reported worldwide.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of any porphyria is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease as well as the varied and non-specific findings that patients present with. Bedside measurement of urine porphobilinogen is recommended as a screening test for patients suspected of having an acute porphyria. Elevated porphobilinogen is indicative of an acute porphyria, and additional testing can be done to narrow down the specific type.

The identification of a specific porphyria is based on the results of laboratory findings, including blood, urine and stool tests. HCP can be distinguished from most other acute porphyrias by the cutaneous findings. VP presents similarly, but can be distinguished based on urine and stool porphyrin analysis, typically done using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The results of biochemical testing for porphyrias are most informative when samples are collected during an acute attack. Typically, the distinguishing metabolite for HCP and VP is the presence of protoporphyrin in the plasma and feces of individuals affected with VP.

Elevated coproporphyrin is a common finding in urine, known as coproporphyrinuria as it is the predominant porphyrin species in urine. This is a non-specific finding that is not necessarily due to an acute porphyria. Coproporphyrinuria can be caused by other stressors to the heme biosynthetic pathway, such as liver disease, lead poisoning and certain bone marrow disorders.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for HCP caused by the deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase. Treatment of the acute symptoms of HCP is the same as for other acute porphyrias. Intravenous hemin (as heme arginate or hematin) is the recommended therapy for acute attacks. Acute attacks can be severe enough to cause death if not treated quickly and correctly. Hospitalization is typically required for administration of hemin, and appropriate drug selection is key to avoid exacerbating symptoms with drugs that interact poorly with porphyrias. Proper drug selection is most difficult when it comes to treatment of the seizures that can accompany HCP, as most anti-seizure medications can make the symptoms worse. Gabapentin and levetiracetam are two anti-seizure drugs that are thought to be safe.

In patients where management of symptoms is difficult even with hemin, liver transplant is an option before the symptoms have progressed to advanced paralysis. Combined liver and kidney transplants are sometimes undertaken in people with kidney failure.

Long term treatment of acute porphyrias is centered on the avoidance of acute attacks by eliminating precipitating factors, such as drugs, dietary changes, and infections. Females often have attacks coincident with their menstrual cycle, which can be managed effectively with hormonal birth control. Because of the reduced penetrance of HCP, family members of a patient may carry the same mutation without ever presenting with symptoms. Molecular analysis of &quot;CPOX&quot; is the best way to identify these patients, as they will not express a biochemical phenotype on laboratory testing unless they are symptomatic. Identification of asymptomatic patients allows them to adjust their lifestyle to avoid common triggering factors.

<doc id="518663" wikidata="Q592161" url="?curid=518663" title="Tomoko Kawakami">
<text>was a Japanese voice actress. She was also known by her pen-name Tomozou (とも蔵), and her Christian name Cecilia (セシリア). Having graduated from the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music, she was a member of Production Baobab.

==Career==
Kawakami debuted in 1994 as a role of a boy in &quot;Metal Fighter Miku&quot;. Her first regular performance was in 1995 as Chiriko in &quot;Fushigi Yuugi&quot;. Two years after, she landed her first starring voice role as Utena Tenjou in Revolutionary Girl Utena. Aside from Chiriko and Utena, her famous roles are in &quot;Air&quot; (Misuzu Kamio), &quot;Bleach&quot; (Soifon), &quot;Chrono Crusade&quot; (Rosette Christopher), &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot; (Hikaru Shindo), &quot;Sgt. Frog&quot; (Fuyuki Hinata), &quot;Ape Escape&quot; (Natsumi),Yukiko Kawasaki (Dear Boys), Sugar (A Little Snow Fairy Sugar), Aria (Athena Glory), and Miu Fūrinji ().

Kawakami provided voices for young boys, girls and comical characters. The best-known genre of her roles are tomboyish characters (Soifon, Utena Tenjou). With such a powerful voice, she was often affiliated in paranormal and yuri-themed anime. She also made her name voicing the heroine in the Harukanaru Toki no Naka de series, based from the Neoromance game with the same title produced by Koei in 2000.

===Illness and death===
In August 2008, Kawakami had ovarian cancer, which required surgery. During a three-year battle with cancer, most of her ongoing roles were replaced by other voice actresses, although Kawakami managed to do some voice work until her retirement in early 2010.

<doc id="518665" wikidata="Q275385" url="?curid=518665" title="Variegate porphyria">
<text>Variegate porphyria, also known by several other names, is an autosomal dominant porphyria that can have acute (severe but usually not long-lasting) symptoms along with symptoms that affect the skin. The disorder results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the seventh step in heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body&#x27;s organs. It is a component of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.

==Signs and symptoms==
When symptoms occur, they can include acute attacks (similar to acute intermittent porphyria) or skin damage. Acute attacks usually begin in adulthood and cause abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. During an attack, a person may also experience muscle weakness, seizures, and mental changes such as anxiety and hallucinations. These signs and symptoms are triggered by nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, dieting or fasting, certain hormones and stress.

Some people with variegate porphyria have skin that is overly sensitive to sunlight (photosensitive). Areas of skin exposed to the sun develop severe blistering, scarring, changes in pigmentation, and increased hair growth. Exposed skin becomes fragile and is easily damaged.

Rarely, the signs and symptoms of variegate porphyria can begin in infancy or early childhood. In such cases, the signs and symptoms are usually more severe than those starting later in life.

==Genetics==

Mutations in the PPOX gene cause variegate porphyria. The PPOX gene makes a membrane bound mitochondrial enzyme called protoporphyrinogen oxidase, which is critical to the chemical process that leads to heme production. The activity of this enzyme is reduced by 50 percent in most people with variegate porphyria. In severe cases that begin early in life, the enzyme is almost completely inactive. Nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, stress, and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of protoporphyrinogen oxidase disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the liver, triggering an acute attack.

Variegate porphyria is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and inheriting one copy of the defective gene from an affected parent is sufficient to cause the disorder. More severe cases result from inheriting two copies of the defective gene.

The entire PPOX gene has about 8kb with 13 exon sequences. It was successfully cloned from a cDNA library in 1995 revealing that, after processing, it is 477 nucleotides long. It has previously been thought that the PPOX gene was located on human chromosome 14, however mapping experiments (FISH) have shown that it is near 1q23. An additional aggravating mutation affecting variegate porphyria can be found at 6p21.3 on the HFE gene.

A 2006 clinical, biochemical and mutational study of eight Swiss variegate porphyria patients and their families found four novel PPOX gene mutations believed to be unique to the Swiss population.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by finding raised urine porphyrins, raised faecal porphyrins, markedly raised plasma porphyrins (pathognomic) and finding photosensitive cutaneous lesions on clinical examination.

==Treatment==
Liver transplant has been used in the treatment of this condition.

==Epidemiology==
In South Africa, the prevalence of variegate porphyria is approximately 1 in 300. In Finland, the prevalence is approximately 1 in 75,000.

It is also found in Argentina, Sweden, and Australia.

<doc id="518666" wikidata="Q1479497" url="?curid=518666" title="Porphyria cutanea tarda">
<text>Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common subtype of porphyria. The disease is named because it is a porphyria that often presents with skin manifestations later in life. The disorder results from low levels of the enzyme responsible for the fifth step in heme production. Heme is a vital molecule for all of the body&#x27;s organs. It is a component of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood.

Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria has been described as a homozygous form of porphyria cutanea tarda, although it can also be caused if two different mutations occur at the same locus.

==Symptoms and signs==
Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is recognized as the most prevalent subtype of porphyritic diseases.

PCT is characterized by onycholysis and blistering of the skin in areas that receive higher levels of exposure to sunlight. The primary cause is a deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), a cytosolic enzyme that is a step in the enzymatic pathway that leads to the synthesis of heme. Behind the direct cause there are a number of genetic and environmental risk factors.

Patients who are diagnosed with PCT typically seek treatment following the development of photosensitivities causing blisters and erosions on exposed areas of the skin. This is usually observed in the face, hands, forearms, and lower legs. Healing is slow and leaves scarring. Though blisters are the most common skin manifestations of PCT, other skin manifestations include hyperpigmentation (similar to a tan) and hypertrichosis (mainly on the cheeks) also occur. PCT is a chronic condition, with external symptoms often subsiding and recurring as a result of multiple factors. In addition to the skin lesions, chronic liver disease is very common in patients with sporadic PCT. This involves hepatic fibrosis (scarring of the liver), and inflammation. However, liver problems are less common in patients with the inherited form of the disease. Additionally, patients will often void a wine-red color urine with an increased concentration of uroporphyrin I due to their enzymatic deficiency.

===Vitamin, mineral, and enzyme deficiencies===
Certain vitamin and minerals deficiencies are common in people with porphyria cutanea tarda. The most common deficiencies are beta-Carotene, retinol, vitamin A and vitamin C. Beta-Carotene is required to synthesize vitamin A and vitamin A is needed to synthesize retinol. A lack of retinol-binding protein is due to a lack of retinol which is required to trigger its production.

Porphyrins interact with iron, absorbing photons to create reactive oxygen species is the mechanism of action causing the itchy, painful blisters of PCT. The reactive oxygen species consume the skin antioxidants beta-carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Supplementation of these three vitamins reduces the oxidation and potentially diminishes the severity of blister formation. No single one of the three vitamins can inhibit the damaging effects of oxidized porphyrins, specifically uroporphyrins and coproporphyrins, but all three working together synergistically are capable of neutralizing their damaging effects.

==Genetics==
Inherited mutations in the &quot;UROD&quot; gene cause about 20% of cases (the other 80% of cases do not have mutations in UROD, and are classified as sporadic). UROD makes an enzyme called uroporphyrinogen III decarboxylase, which is critical to the chemical process that leads to heme production. The activity of this enzyme is usually reduced by 50% in all tissues in people with the inherited form of the condition.

Nongenetic factors such as excess iron or partially genetic factors such as alcohol use disorder and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the body, triggering the signs and symptoms of porphyria cutanea tarda.

The &quot;HFE&quot; gene makes a protein that helps cells regulate the absorption of iron from the digestive tract and into the cells of the body. Certain mutations in the &quot;HFE&quot; gene cause hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder). People who have these mutations are also at an increased risk of developing porphyria cutanea tarda.

In the 20% of cases where porphyria cutanea tarda is inherited, it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to decrease enzyme activity and cause the signs and symptoms of the disorder.

===Other===
While inherited deficiencies in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase often lead to the development of PCT, there are a number of risk factors that can both cause and exacerbate the symptoms of this disease. One of the most common risk factors observed is infection with the Hepatitis C virus. One review of a collection of PCT studies noted Hepatitis C infection in 50% of documented cases of PCT. Additional risk factors include alcohol use disorder, excess iron (from iron supplements as well as cooking on cast iron skillets), and exposure to chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons and Agent Orange.

It can be a paraneoplastic phenomenon.

===Exacerbating factors===
* Alcohol
* Estrogen
* Iron
* Hepatitis C virus

==Pathogenesis==
Porphyria cutanea tarda is primarily caused by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency (UROD). Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase occurs in nature as a homodimer of two subunits. It participates in the fifth step in heme synthesis pathway, and is active in the cytosol. This enzymatic conversion results in coproporphyrinogen III as the primary product. This is accomplished by the clockwise removal of the four carboxyl groups present in the cyclic uroporphyrinogen III molecule. Therefore, a deficiency in this enzyme causes the aforementioned buildup of uroporphyrinogen and hepta-carboxylic porphyrinogen, and to a lesser extent hexa-carboxylic porphyrinogen, and penta-carboxylic porphyrinogen in the urine, which can be helpful in the diagnosis of this disorder.

The dermatological symptoms of PCT that include blistering and lesions on sun-exposed areas of the skin are caused by a buildup of porphyrin compounds (specifically uroporphyrinogen) close to the surface of the skin that have been oxidized by free radicals or sunlight. The oxidized porphyrins initiate degranulation of dermal mast cells, which release proteases that catabolize the surrounding proteins. This begins a cell-mediated positive feedback loop which matches the description of a type 4 delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The resulting blisters, therefore, do not appear immediately but begin to show up 2–3 days after sun exposure. Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin. Excess alcohol intake decreases hepcidin production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress. This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their oxidized porphyrins form. Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc.) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation.

The strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C virus infection is not entirely understood. Studies have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes can lead to the release of free iron. This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species. These can oxidize the UROD substrate uroporphyrinogen, which can result in the inhibition of UROD and lead to deficient activity of this key enzyme.

Excess alcohol use is frequently associated with both inducing PCT&lt;ref name=&quot;urleMedicine/Stedman Medical Dictionary Lookup!&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and aggravating a preexisting diagnosis of the disorder. It is thought to do so by causing oxidative damage to liver cells, resulting in oxidized species of uroporphyrinogen that inhibit the activity of hepatic UROD. It is also felt to increase the uptake of iron in liver cells, leading to further oxidation of uroporphyrinogen by the release of activated oxygen species. Additionally, exposure to chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons can lead to a deficiency in the activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, causing the buildup of excess uroporphyrinogen. Additionally, alcohol has been shown to increase the activity of the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase (ALA synthetase), the rate-limiting enzymatic step in heme synthesis in the mitochondria, in rats. Therefore, alcohol consumption may increase the production of uroporphyrinogen, exacerbating symptoms in individuals with porphyria cutanea tarda.

==Diagnosis==
While the most common symptom of PCT is the appearance of skin lesions and blistering, their appearance is not conclusive. Laboratory testing commonly reveals high levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine, clinically referred to as uroporphyrinogenuria. Additionally, testing for common risk factors such as hepatitis C and hemochromatosis is strongly suggested, as their high prevalence in patients with PCT may require additional treatment. If clinical appearance of PCT is present, but laboratories are negative, the diagnosis of pseudoporphyria should be seriously considered.

===Classification===
Some sources divide PCT into two types: sporadic and familial. Other sources include a third type, but this is less common.

One study used 74% as the cutoff for UROD activity, with those patients under that number being classified as type II, and those above classified as type III if there was a family history, and type I if there was not.

Genetic variants associated with hemochromatosis have been observed in PCT patients, which may help explain inherited PCT not associated with UROD.

==Treatment==
Since PCT is a chronic condition, a comprehensive management of the disease is the most effective means of treatment. Primarily, it is key that patients diagnosed with PCT avoid alcohol consumption, iron supplements, excess exposure to sunlight (especially in the summer), as well as estrogen and chlorinated cyclic hydrocarbons, all of which can potentially exacerbate the disorder. Additionally, the management of excess iron (due to the commonality of hemochromatosis in PCT patients) can be achieved through phlebotomy, whereby blood is systematically drained from the patient. A borderline iron deficiency has been found to have a protective effect by limiting heme synthesis. In the absence of iron, which is to be incorporated in the porphyrin formed in the last step of the synthesis, the mRNA of erythroid 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS-2) is blocked by attachment of an iron-responsive element (IRE) binding cytosolic protein, and transcription of this key enzyme is inhibited.

Low doses of antimalarials can be used. Orally ingested chloroquine is completely absorbed in the gut and is preferentially concentrated in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. They work by removing excess porphyrins from the liver via increasing the excretion rate by forming a coordination complex with the iron center of the porphyrin as well as an intramolecular hydrogen bond between a propionate side chain of the porphyrin and the protonated quinuclidine nitrogen atom of either alkaloid. Due to the presence of the chlorine atom, the entire complex is more water-soluble allowing the kidneys to preferentially remove it from the blood stream and expel it through urination. Chloroquine treatment can induce porphyria attacks within the first couple of months of treatment due to the mass mobilization of porphyrins from the liver into the blood stream. Complete remission can be seen within 6–12 months as each dose of antimalarial can only remove a finite amount of porphyrins and there are generally decades of accumulation to be cleared. Originally, higher doses were used to treat the condition but are no longer recommended because of liver toxicity. Finally, due to the strong association between PCT and Hepatitis C, the treatment of Hepatitis C (if present) is vital to the effective treatment of PCT.
Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and venesection are typically employed in the management strategy.

==Epidemiology==
PCT prevalence is estimated at 1 in 10,000. An estimated 80% of porphyria cutanea tarda cases are sporadic. The exact frequency is not clear because many people with the condition never experience symptoms and those that do are often misdiagnosed with anything ranging from idiopathic photodermatitis and seasonal allergies to hives.

<text>Erythropoietic protoporphyria (or commonly called EPP) is a form of porphyria, which varies in severity and can be very painful. It arises from a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase, leading to abnormally high levels of protoporphyrin in the red blood cells (erythrocytes), plasma, skin, and liver. The severity varies significantly from individual to individual.

A clinically similar form of porphyria, known as X-Linked dominant protoporphyria, was identified in 2008.

==Presentation==

EPP usually presents in childhood with the most common mode of presentation as acute photosensitivity of the skin. It affects areas exposed to the sun and tends to be intractable. A few minutes of exposure to the sun induces pruritus, erythema, swelling and pain. Longer periods of exposure may induce second degree burns. After repetitive exposure, patients may present with lichenification, hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation and scarring of the skin.

EPP usually first presents in childhood, and most often affects the face and the upper surfaces of the arms, hands, and feet and the exposed surfaces of the legs. Most patients, if the EPP is not as severe, manifest symptoms with onset of puberty when the male and female hormone levels elevate during sexual development and maintenance. More severe EPP can manifest in infancy. EPP can be triggered through exposure to sun even though the patient is behind glass. Even the UV emissions from arc welding with the use of full protective mask have been known to trigger EPP. EPP can also manifest between the ages of 3 and 6.

Prolonged exposure to the sun can lead to edema of the hands, face, and feet, rarely with blistering and petechiae. Skin thickening can sometimes occur over time.

People with EPP are also at increased risk to develop gallstones. One study has noted that EPP patients suffer from vitamin D deficiency.

===Liver failure===
Protoporphyrin accumulates to toxic levels in the liver in 5–20% of EPP patients, leading to liver failure. The spectrum of hepatobiliary disease associated with EPP is wide. It includes cholelithiasis, mild parenchymal liver disease, progressive hepatocellular disease and end-stage liver disease.

A lack of diagnostic markers for liver failure makes it difficult to predict which patients may experience liver failure, and the mechanism of liver failure is poorly understood. A retrospective European study identified 31 EPP patients receiving a liver transplant between 1983 and 2008, with phototoxic reactions in 25% of patients who were unprotected by surgical light filters. The same study noted a 69% recurrence of the disease in the grafted organ. Five UK liver transplants for EPP have been identified between 1987 and 2009. Frequent liver testing is recommended in EPP patients where no effective therapy has been identified to manage liver failure to date.

===Pregnancy===
EPP photosensitivity symptoms are reported to lessen in some female patients during pregnancy and menstruation, although this phenomenon is not consistent, and the mechanism is not understood. This brings evidence that the pathology of the disorder may be mediated partially by the sex hormones.

== Genetics ==
Most cases of EPP are results of inborn errors of metabolism but the metabolic defect in some patients may be acquired. Mutation of the gene that encodes for ferrochelatase in the long arm of chromosome 18 is found in majority of the cases. Ferrochelatase (FECH) catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into the protoporphyrin IX ring to form heme. EPP exhibits both recessive and dominant patterns of inheritance and a high degree of allelic heterogeneity with incomplete penetrance. Most heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Symptoms do not occur unless FECH activity is less than 30% of normal, but such low levels are not present in a majority of patients.

== Pathophysiology ==
Cells which synthesize heme are predominantly erythroblasts/reticulocytes in the bone marrow (80%) and hepatocytes (20%). Deficiency of FECH results in increased release of protoporphyrin, which binds to albumin in plasma and subsequently undergoes hepatic extraction. Normally, most protoporphyrin in hepatocytes is secreted into bile; the remainder undergoes transformation into heme. Some protoporphyrin in bile is returned to the liver as a consequence of the enterohepatic circulation; the remaining protoporphyrin in the intestine undergoes fecal excretion. Protoporphyrin is insoluble and hence unavailable for renal excretion. In EPP, subnormal biotransformation of protoporphyrin into heme results in accumulation of protoporphyrin in hepatocytes.

Since FECH deficiency is associated with increased concentrations of protoporphyrin in erythrocytes, plasma, skin and liver, retention of protoporphyrin in skin predisposes to acute photosensitivity. As a result of absorption of ultraviolet and visible light (peak sensitivity at 400 nm, with lesser peaks between 500–625 nm) by protoporphyrin in plasma and erythrocytes when blood circulates through the dermal vessels, free radicals are formed, erythrocytes become unstable and injury to the skin is induced.

A significant increase in the hepatobiliary excretion of protoporphyrin can damage the liver through both cholestatic phenomena and oxidative stress—predisposing to hepatobiliary disease of varying degrees of severity.

== Diagnosis ==
EPP is generally suspected by the presence of acute photosensitivity of the skin and can be confirmed by detection of a plasmatic fluorescence peak at 634 nm. It is also useful to find increased levels of protoporphyrin in feces and the demonstration of an excess of free protoporphyrin in erythrocytes.

Screening for &quot;FECH&quot; mutation on one allele or aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 gain-of-function mutation in selected family members may be useful, especially in genetic counseling.

Liver biopsy confirms hepatic disease in EPP by the presence of protoporphyrin deposits in the hepatocytes that can be observed as a brown pigment within the biliary canaliculi and the portal macrophages. Macroscopically, the cirrhotic liver can have a black color due to protoporphyrin deposits. Using polarized light the characteristic Maltese cross shape of birefringent crystalline pigment deposits is found. The examination of liver tissue under a Wood&#x27;s lamp reveals a red fluorescence due to protoporphyrin. Liver biopsy is not helpful for estimation of prognosis of liver disease.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for this disorder; however, symptoms can usually be managed by limiting exposure to daytime sun and some types of artificial lighting. Most types of artificial lighting emit light in the problematic wavelengths, with fluorescent lighting being the worst offender. Color temperature can be a good indicator of what light is most detrimental, as the higher the color temperature, the more violet light (380–450 nm) is emitted. Incandescent and LED lighting in the soft white range (2700–3000 K) produce the least problematic light. Additionally, selecting lower wattage bulbs can reduce the overall output of light.

Since the photosensitivity results from light in the visible spectrum, most sunscreens are of little use (with the exception of non-nano zinc oxide which provides uniform protection between 290–400 nm and some protection up to 700 nm). Sun protective clothing can also be very helpful, although clothing with UPF values are only rated based on their UV protection (up to 400 nm) and not on their protection from the visible spectrum. Some sun protective clothing manufacturers use zinc oxide in their fabrics, such as Coolibar&#x27;s ZnO Suntect line, which will offer protection from visible light.

Window films which block UV and visible light up to 450 nm can provide relief from symptoms if applied to the patient&#x27;s automobile and home windows.

Blue blocking screen protectors can help provide relief from symptoms caused by televisions, phones, tablets and computer screens.

EPP is considered one of the least severe of the porphyrias. Unless there is liver failure, it is not a life-threatening disease.

=== Approved therapies ===
Afamelanotide, developed by Australian-based Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals, was approved in Europe in December 2014 and in the United States in October 2019 for treatment or prevention of phototoxicity in adults with EPP.

=== Off-label therapies ===
Several drugs are used off label by patients with EPP:
* Ursodeoxycholic acid is a bile acid that is administered to promote biliary secretion of protoporphyrin. Results of its use in EPP are controversial. However, it is known to alter the composition of bile, to protect hepatocytes from the cytotoxic effect of hydrophobic bile acids, and to stimulate biliary secretion by several distinct mechanisms.
* Hematin appears to reduce excess protoporphyrin production in the bone marrow. It has been administered to patients with EPP (3–4 mg/kg iv) who develop a crisis after liver transplantation.
* Plasmapheresis can also decrease the levels of protoporphyrin in plasma, however its use in treating acute episodes is controversial.
* Cholestyramine is an orally administered resin which reduces circulating levels of protoporphyrin by binding to protoporphyrin in the intestine and, hence, interrupting the enterohepatic circulation. It is usually used in combination with other treatment approaches.
* Activated carbon, like cholestyramine, binds to protoporphyrin in the intestine and prevents its absorption. It is cheap and readily available. It seems to be effective in reducing circulating protoporphyrin levels.

Bone marrow transplantation, liver transplantation, acetylcysteine, extracorporeal albumin dialysis, parenteral iron and transfusion of erythrocytes are alternative plans for treatment of EEP.

=== Over-the-counter drug ===
Some over-the-counter drugs may help:
* Proferrin is an oral heme supplement which may work similarly to Hematin.
* &quot;B. subtilis&quot; (a gram-positive soil probiotic) produces ferrochelatase, which may be able to convert some of the protoporphyrin in the intestine into heme.
* Beta carotene, though a recent meta analysis of carotene treatment has called its effectiveness into question.

=== Experimental therapies ===
Bitopertin has been undergoing trials in Australia since 2022 with some success in allowing participants to spend more time in full sunlight without ill effects. 

=== Home remedies ===
Although erythropoietic protoporphyria symptoms may be temporarily suppressed with cold temperatures, patients have found that this method may extend, or even intensify pain and discomfort. However, home treatments that increase blood flow to the affected areas, such as immersion in warm water with quick drying or warm dry compresses, may increase the rate of pain relief. This has been noted as particularly effective in the hands, forearms, and face, as areas of decreased blood flow may be exposed to the accumulation of protoporphyrins for an extended period. 

== Epidemiology ==
Case reports suggest that EPP is prevalent globally. The prevalence has been estimated somewhere between 1 in 75,000 and 1 in 200,000 however it has been noted that the prevalence of EPP may be increasing due to a better understanding of the disease and improved diagnosis. An estimated 5,000–10,000 individuals worldwide have EPP. EPP is considered the most common form of porphyria in children. The prevalence in Sweden has been published as 1:180,000.

==History==
Erythropoietic protoporphyria was first described in 1953 by Kosenow and Treibs and completed in 1960 by Magnus &quot;et al.&quot; at the St John&#x27;s Institute of Dermatology in London.

<text>The submarine film is a subgenre of war film in which most of the plot revolves around a submarine below the ocean&#x27;s surface. Films of this subgenre typically focus on a small but determined crew of submariners battling against enemy submarines or submarine-hunter ships, or against other problems ranging from disputes amongst the crew, threats of mutiny, life-threatening mechanical breakdowns, or the daily difficulties of living on a submarine.

The genre plays on the psychological tension of the submarine&#x27;s crew and their unseen enemy, signified by a soundscape that may feature explosions, the ping of sonar, the creaking of the submarine&#x27;s hull under extreme pressure, the alarm ordering the submarine to dive, and the threatening sound signatures of a destroyer&#x27;s propeller or of an approaching torpedo.

Some 150 films have been made in the submarine genre between 1910 and 2010, variously depicting submarines in relatively realistic stories about World War I, World War II or the Cold War, or purely fictional and fantastic scenarios.

==Characteristics==
Submarine films have their own particular semantics and syntax, creating a film genre concerned specifically with submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this genre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in the 1981 &quot;Das Boot&quot;, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, and as the critic Linda Maria Koldau writes,

Koldau identifies the basic syntactic structure of the submarine genre as &quot;outside is bad, inside is good.&quot; The unseen outside means the enemy: this may be from nature, with elements such as water pressure threatening to crush the hull, sea monsters, or underwater rocks; or human opponents. Meanwhile, the inside of the submarine represents the human warmth and trust of the crew for each other and for their captain, their lives bound together by the situation. To this scenario can be added elements from within such as mutiny, fire, discord, or accidents including radiation leakage; and from outside such as water, terrorism, disease, and weapons, while the plot may feature sudden switches from being the hunter to being the hunted.

The soundscape may depict the creaking of the hull under pressure: as Koldau observes, this is both realistic and metaphoric, standing in for the fear and the responsibility on the shoulders of the crew. Stress may further be expressed in the acoustic signature of specifically submarine threats, such as the swelling sound of an approaching destroyer&#x27;s propeller, the soft buzz of an enemy torpedo, or the submarine&#x27;s own alarm ordering an immediate dive.

Another element of the soundscape less often remarked upon is simply silence, which can mean both safety (nothing is happening) and unseen danger, creating tension.

== List of submarine movies ==

This is a list of movies, grouped by the era in which they were made, in which a submarine plays a significant role in the storyline. From 1910 to 2010, some 150 fictional films about submarines have been made. Many of these are set in World War I, World War II, or the Cold War; others depict relatively &quot;authentic&quot; terrorist scenarios.

Some movies depict historical events from actual battles or incidents, such as &quot;Above Us the Waves&quot;, a 1955 film which depicts the true story of the British Royal Navy&#x27;s midget submarines attacks on the . Other submarine movies develop a fictional plot created using more or less realistic details of naval warfare, such as the film &quot;U-571&quot;, which tells the story of a fictional U-boat in World War II.

Other submarine films from the fantasy, science fiction or occasionally horror film genres depict entirely fictitious events, such as the various film versions of Jules Verne&#x27;s novel &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;.

<text>Baruch Samuel Blumberg (July 28, 1925 April 5, 2011), known as Barry Blumberg, was an American physician, geneticist, and co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (with Daniel Carleton Gajdusek), for his work on the hepatitis B virus while an investigator at the NIH and at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. He was president of the American Philosophical Society from 2005 until his death.

Blumberg and Gajdusek received the Nobel Prize for discovering &quot;new mechanisms for the origin and dissemination of infectious diseases.&quot; Blumberg identified the hepatitis B virus, and later developed its diagnostic test and vaccine.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Blumberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, into a Jewish family, the son of Ida (Simonoff) and Meyer Blumberg, a lawyer. He first attended the Orthodox Yeshivah of Flatbush for elementary school, where–in addition to all regular school subjects–he learned to read and write in Hebrew, and to study the Bible and Jewish texts in their original language. (That school also had among its students a contemporary of Blumberg, Eric Kandel, who is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine.) Blumberg then attended Brooklyn&#x27;s James Madison High School, a school that Blumberg described as having high academic standards, including many teachers with Ph.D.s. After moving to Far Rockaway, Queens, he transferred to Far Rockaway High School in the early 1940s, a school that also produced fellow laureates Burton Richter and Richard Feynman. Blumberg served as a U.S. Navy deck officer during World War II. He then attended Union College in Schenectady, New York, and graduated from there with honors in 1946.

Originally entering the graduate program in mathematics at Columbia University, Blumberg switched to medicine and enrolled at Columbia&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he received his MD in 1951. He remained at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center for the next four years, first as an intern and then as a resident. He then moved to the University of Oxford and began graduate work in biochemistry at Balliol College, Oxford, and earned his DPhil there in 1957. He later became the first American to be master at Balliol College, Oxford.

===Scientific career===

Throughout the 1950s, Blumberg traveled the world taking human blood samples, to study the genetic variations in human beings, focusing on the question of why some people contract a disease in a given environment, while others do not. In 1964, while studying &quot;yellow jaundice&quot; (hepatitis), he discovered a surface antigen for hepatitis B in the blood of an Australian aborigine, hence initially called the &#x27;Australian antigen&#x27;. His work later demonstrated that the virus could cause liver cancer. Blumberg and his team were able to develop a screening test for the hepatitis B virus, to prevent its spread in blood donations, and developed a vaccine. Blumberg later freely distributed his vaccine patent in order to promote its distribution by drug companies. Deployment of the vaccine reduced the infection rate of hepatitis B in children in China from 15% to 1% in 10 years.

In 1964, Blumberg became a member of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) of the Lankenau Hospital Research Institute in Philadelphia, known today as the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR), which later joined the Fox Chase Cancer Center in 1974, and he held the rank of University Professor of Medicine and Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania starting in 1977. Concurrently, he was Master of Balliol College from 1989 to 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994. From 1999 to 2002, he was also director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute at the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.

In 1992, Blumberg participated in the founding of the Hepatitis B Foundation (HBF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure for hepatitis B and improving the lives of those affected by hepatitis B worldwide. He served on the Scientific and Medical Advisory Board, and as its distinguished scholar from 1992 until his passing in 2011. Blumberg was a regular and inspirational presence at the Hepatitis Foundation, maintaining an office at the foundation in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.

In 2000, Blumberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2001, Blumberg was named to the Library of Congress Scholars Council, a body of distinguished scholars that advises the Librarian of Congress. Blumberg served on the council until his death.

In November 2004, Blumberg was named chairman of the scientific advisory board of United Therapeutics Corporation, a position he held until his death. As chairman, he convened three &quot;Conference[s] on Nanomedical and Telemedical Technology&quot;, as well as guiding the biotechnology company in the development of a broad-spectrum anti-viral medicine.

Beginning in 2005, Blumberg also served as the president of the American Philosophical Society. He had first been elected to membership in the society in 1986.

In October 2010, Blumberg participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program, in which middle and high school students of the Greater Washington, D.C., Northern Virginia and Maryland area got to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize–winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.

In discussing the factors that influenced his life, Blumberg always gave credit to the mental discipline of the Jewish Talmud, and as often as possible, he attended weekly Talmud discussion classes until his death.

===Bioethics===
Blumberg devoted his 1976 Nobel lecture to the subject of bioethics. He predicted the discovery of the Hepatitis B chronic carrier state would lead to calls for exclusion and quarantine of chronic carriers and the denial of health care. Blumberg came down solidly on the side of liberty and stated it was better not to test for the condition in medical practice. The following year, the teachers&#x27; union in New York City moved to exclude chronic carriers from the New York school system. At the time, a number of developmentally disabled children who had been institutionalized at Willowbrook were being mainstreamed into the public schools. As part of the Willowbrook hepatitis experiments, most children had been involuntarily tested and over 50 chronic carriers had been identified. The New York Public Health department convened a panel to decide policy led by Saul Krugman; however, Blumberg with his open views, was notably excluded. The panel and school system decided to exclude all known Hepatitis B carriers from school attendance and impose compulsory blood testing on all their classmates without informed consent about the nature of the blood tests. Litigation on behalf of the excluded children reversed the policy, and Blumberg advised the excluded children&#x27;s lawyers. This set important precedent for the AIDS era. 

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2002 he stated that &quot;[Saving lives] is what drew me to medicine. There is, in Jewish thought, this idea that if you save a single life, you save the whole world&quot;.

===Death===
Blumberg died on April 5, 2011, shortly after giving the keynote speech at the International Lunar Research Park Exploratory Workshop held at NASA Ames Research Center. At the time of his death Blumberg was a distinguished scientist at the NASA Lunar Science Institute, located at the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California.

Jonathan Chernoff, the scientific director at the Fox Chase Cancer Center where Blumberg spent most of his working life said, &quot;I think it&#x27;s fair to say that Barry prevented more cancer deaths than any person who&#x27;s ever lived.&quot; In reference to Blumberg&#x27;s discovery of the Hepatitis B vaccine, former NASA administrator Daniel Goldin said, &quot;Our planet is an improved place as a result of Barry&#x27;s few short days in residence.&quot;

In 2011, the Library of Congress and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) announced the establishment of the Baruch S. Blumberg NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology, a research position housed within the library&#x27;s John W. Kluge Center, which explores the effects of astrobiology research on society. The chair was named for Blumberg in recognition of his service to the Library of Congress Scholars Council, and his commitment to &quot;research and dialogue between disciplines.&quot;

In 2011, in recognition of Blumberg&#x27;s long professional and personal association with the department of biochemistry and the Glycobiology Institute, Oxford University established the Baruch Blumberg Professorship in Virology.

=== Manuscript collection ===

<doc id="518687" wikidata="Q1196370" url="?curid=518687" title="The Raven (1963 film)">
<text>The Raven is a 1963 American comedy gothic horror film produced and directed by Roger Corman. The film stars Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, and Boris Karloff as a trio of rival sorcerers. The supporting cast includes Jack Nicholson as the son of Lorre&#x27;s character.

It was the fifth in the so-called Corman-Poe cycle of eight films largely featuring adaptations of Edgar Allan Poe stories produced by Roger Corman and released by American International Pictures (AIP). The film was written by Richard Matheson, based on references to Poe&#x27;s 1845 poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. AIP released the film as a double feature with &quot;Night Tide&quot;.

Three decades earlier, Karloff had appeared in another film with the same title, Lew Landers&#x27;s 1935 horror film &quot;The Raven&quot; with Bela Lugosi.

==Plot==
In the year 1506, the sorcerer Dr. Erasmus Craven has been mourning the death of his wife Lenore for over two years, much to the dismay of his daughter (Lenore&#x27;s stepdaughter), Estelle. One night he is visited by a raven, the wizard Dr. Bedlo. Together they brew a potion that restores Bedlo to human form.

Bedlo explains that he was transformed by Dr. Scarabus in an unfair duel. Both decide to see Scarabus, Bedlo to exact revenge and Craven to look for his wife, whom Bedlo saw alive at Scarabus&#x27;s castle. After fighting off an attack by Craven&#x27;s coachman, who acted under the influence of Scarabus, they are joined by Estelle and Bedlo&#x27;s son Rexford, and set out to the castle. Estelle and Rexford become fond of each other over the journey.

At the castle, Scarabus greets his guests with false friendship, and Bedlo is apparently killed as he conjures a storm in an act of defiance. At night, however, Rexford finds Bedlo alive and well, hiding in the castle. Bedlo conspired with Scarabus to deliver Craven to him, so that Scarabus could acquire his magical secrets. Craven, meanwhile, is visited and tormented by Lenore, who is revealed to have faked her death to become Scarabus&#x27;s mistress.

As Craven, Estelle, Rexford and Bedlo try to escape from the castle, Scarabus stops them, and they are imprisoned. Bedlo panics and begs Scarabus to turn him back into a raven rather than torture him. He then flees the dungeon by flying away. Craven is forced to choose between surrendering his magical secrets to Scarabus or watching his daughter be tortured. Having only pretended to desert his friends and son, Bedlo secretly returns and frees Rexford, and together they aid Craven.

Craven and Scarabus engage in a magic duel. After a series of attacks, counterattacks and insults, during which Scarabus sets the castle on fire, Craven defeats Scarabus. Lenore tries to reconcile with him, claiming that she was bewitched by Scarabus, but Craven disbelieves and rejects her. Craven, Bedlo, Estelle and Rexford escape as the castle collapses on Scarabus and Lenore; both survive, but Scarabus&#x27;s magic is gone.

Bedlo, still a raven, tries to convince Craven to restore him to human form. Still bitter over Bedlo&#x27;s earlier betrayal, Craven casts a spell to render him mute.

==Production==

===Script===
Roger Corman and Richard Matheson had both enjoyed making the comic &quot;The Black Cat&quot; episode of &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; and wanted to try an entirely comic Poe feature.

&quot;After I heard they wanted to make a movie out of a poem, I felt that was an utter joke, so comedy was really the only way to go with it&quot;, said Matheson.

===Shooting===
The film was shot in 15 days.

Roger Corman said that although they kept closely to the structure and story script, &quot;We did more improvisation on that film than any of the others.&quot; During shooting, Peter Lorre ad-libbed a number of lines in the film including:
* &quot;How the hell should I know?&quot;, after Vincent Price asks &quot;shall I ever see the rare and radiant Lenore again?&quot;
* &quot;Where else?&quot; after Vincent Price says &quot;I keep her here.&quot; (referring to the body of his lost love Lenore, kept in a coffin in the hall)
* &quot;Hard place to keep clean.&quot;
Roger Corman said that Lorre&#x27;s improvisations confused both Vincent Price and Boris Karloff, but Price adapted to it well while Karloff struggled:
Overall I would say we had as good a spirit on &quot;The Raven&quot; as any film I&#x27;ve ever worked on, except for a couple of moments with Boris. There was a slight edge to it, because Boris came in with a carefully worked out preparation, so when Peter started improvising lines, it really threw Boris off from his preparation.

Corman said the tension between Peter Lorre and Jack Nicholson as father and son came from the actors rather than the script, as the two did not get along well.

Vincent Price later recalled about the final duel:
Boris hated being strung up in the air on those chairs. He was terribly crippled, and we were both floating in the air on these wires. It wasn&#x27;t a pleasant feeling! And I hated having that snake wrapped around my neck for two hours... I hate snakes.
Boris Karloff later said he was annoyed at having to wear the heavy cape.

The footage of the burning interior of the castle was reused from Corman&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;House of Usher&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Raven&quot; opened on January 23, 1963 in 100 theaters in the Greater New York area before opening the following week in 50 theaters in Southern California.

===Critical reception===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; panned the film as &quot;comic-book nonsense ... Strickly (sic) a picture for the kiddies and the bird-brained, quote the critic.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that while Poe &quot;might turn over in his crypt at this nonsensical adaptation of his immortal poem&quot;, Corman nevertheless &quot;takes this premise and develops it expertly as a horror-comedy.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;fairly thin fare, made up mostly of camera tricks, and some very obviously false scenery, but Peter Lorre&#x27;s performance is mildly entertaining. Youngsters may find it fun.&quot; A generally positive review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that the film &quot;starts off with the inestimable advantage of a script which not only makes it amply clear from the outset that [Corman] is cheerfully and wholeheartedly sending himself up, but manages to do it wittily.&quot; Its main criticism was a &quot;long central section&quot; of the film that drags until things pick up again for the final duel. Peter John Dyer of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; wrote, &quot;Richard Matheson&#x27;s script, a good deal more tenuous than its predecessors in the Corman-Poe canon, at least treats its actors generously to props, incantations and quotable lines ... A pity the equation doesn&#x27;t always add up; there&#x27;s too much slack, due perhaps to an imbalance between the comedy, which runs riot, and the horror, which trails behind in the wake of previous Corman films.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Raven&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Not so much a raven, more a bit of a lark.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on reviews from 17 critics, with an average rating of 6.8 out of 10.

Shown on the MeTV show Svengoolie on January 7, 2022, and also Dec. 9, 2023.

===Box office===
The film was popular at the box office.

===Novelization===
A novelization of the film was written by Eunice Sudak adapted from Richard Matheson&#x27;s screenplay and published by Lancer Books in paperback. This novel was republished by Bear Manor Media in 2012.

<doc id="518691" wikidata="Q1044742" url="?curid=518691" title="A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte">
<text>A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte () was painted from 1884 to 1886 and is Georges Seurat&#x27;s most famous work. A leading example of pointillist technique, executed on a large canvas, it is a founding work of the neo-impressionist movement. Seurat&#x27;s composition includes a number of Parisians at a park on the banks of the River Seine. It is held in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

==Background==

Georges Seurat painted &quot;A Sunday Afternoon&quot; between May 1884 and March 1885, and from October 1885 to May 1886, focusing meticulously on the landscape of the park and concentrating on issues of colour, light, and form. The painting is approximately in size. Seurat completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches before completing his masterpiece. One complete painting, the study featured to the right, measures 27 3/4 x 41 in. (70.5 x 104.1 cm) and is on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Inspired by optical effects and perception inherent in the color theories of Michel Eugène Chevreul, Ogden Rood and others, Seurat adapted this scientific research to his painting. Seurat contrasted miniature dots or small brushstrokes of colors that when unified optically in the human eye were perceived as a single shade or hue. He believed that this form of painting, called Divisionism at the time (a term he preferred) but now known as Pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brushstrokes. The use of dots of almost uniform size came in the second year of his work on the painting, 1885–86. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, at the paintings edge, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago.

The Island of la Grande Jatte is located at the very gates of Paris, lying in the Seine between Neuilly and Levallois-Perret, a short distance from where La Défense business district currently stands. Although for many years it was an industrial site, it has become the site of a public garden and a housing development. When Seurat began the painting in 1884, the island was a bucolic retreat far from the urban center.

The painting was first exhibited at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886, then in August 1886, dominating the second Salon of the Société des Artistes Indépendants, of which Seurat had been a founder in 1884. Seurat was extremely disciplined, always serious, and private to the point of secretiveness—for the most part, steering his own steady course. As a painter, he wanted to make a difference in the history of art. With &quot;La Grande Jatte&quot;, Seurat was immediately acknowledged as the leader of a new and rebellious form of Impressionism called Neo-Impressionism.

==Interpretation==

Seurat&#x27;s painting was a mirror impression of his own painting, &quot;Bathers at Asnières&quot;, completed shortly before, in 1884. Whereas the bathers in that earlier painting are doused in light, almost every figure on &quot;La Grande Jatte&quot; appears to be cast in shadow, either under trees or an umbrella, or from another person. For Parisians, Sunday was the day to escape the heat of the city and head for the shade of the trees and the cool breezes that came off the river. And at first glance, the viewer sees many different people relaxing in a park by the river. On the right, a fashionable couple, the woman with the sunshade and the man in his top hat, are on a stroll. On the left, another woman who is also well dressed extends her fishing pole over the water. There is a small man with the black hat and thin cane looking at the river, and a white dog with a brown head, a woman knitting, a man playing a trumpet, two soldiers standing at attention as the musician plays, and a woman hunched under an orange umbrella. Seurat also painted a man with a pipe, a woman under a parasol in a boat filled with rowers, and a couple admiring their infant child.

Some of the characters are doing curious things. The lady on the right side has a pet monkey on a leash. A lady on the left near the river bank is fishing. The area was known at the time as being a place to procure prostitutes among the bourgeoisie, a likely allusion of the otherwise odd &quot;fishing&quot; rod. In the painting&#x27;s center stands a little girl dressed in white (who is not in a shadow), who stares directly at the viewer of the painting. This may be interpreted as someone who is silently questioning the audience.

In the 1950s, historian and Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch drew social and political significance from Seurat&#x27;s &quot;La Grande Jatte&quot;. The historian&#x27;s focal point was what he saw as Seurat&#x27;s mechanical use of the figures and what their static nature said about French society at the time. Afterward, critique of the work often centered on the artist&#x27;s presumed mathematical and robotic interpretation of the meaning of modernity in Paris.

According to historian of Modernism William R. Everdell: 

The border of the painting is, unusually, in inverted color, as if the world around them is also slowly inverting from the way of life they have known. Seen in this context, the boy who bathes on the other side of the river bank at Asnières appears to be calling out to them, as if to say, &quot;We are the future. Come and join us&quot;.

==Painting materials==
Seurat painted the &quot;La Grande Jatte&quot; in three distinct stages. In the first stage, which was started in 1884, he mixed his paints from several individual pigments and was still using dull earth pigments such as ochre or burnt sienna. In the second stage, during 1885 and 1886, Seurat dispensed with the earth pigments and also limited the number of individual pigments in his paints. This change in his palette was due to his application of the advanced color theories of his time. His intention was to paint small dots or strokes of pure color that would then mix on the retina of the beholder to achieve the desired color impression instead of the usual practice of mixing individual pigments.

Seurat&#x27;s palette consisted of the usual pigments of his time such as cobalt blue, emerald green and vermilion. Additionally, he used the then new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), predominantly for yellow highlights in the sunlit grass in the middle of the painting but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting&#x27;s completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown—a color degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat&#x27;s lifetime. The discoloration of the originally bright yellow zinc yellow (zinc chromate) to a brownish color is due to the chemical reaction of the chromate ions to orange-colored dichromate ions. In the third stage during 1888–89 Seurat added the colored borders to his composition.

The results of investigation into the discoloration of this painting have been combined with further research into natural aging of paints to digitally rejuvenate the painting.

==Acquisition by the Art Institute of Chicago==

In 1923, Frederic Bartlett was appointed trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago. He and his second wife, Helen Birch Bartlett, loaned their collection of French Post-Impressionist and Modernist art to the museum. It was Mrs. Bartlett who had an interest in French and avant-garde artists and influenced her husband&#x27;s collecting tastes. &quot;Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte&quot; was purchased on the advice of the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s curatorial staff in 1924.

In conceptual artist Don Celender&#x27;s 1974–75 book &quot;Observation and Scholarship Examination for Art Historians, Museum Directors, Artists, Dealers and Collectors&quot;, it is claimed that the institute paid $24,000 for the work (over $354,000 in 2018 dollars).

In 1958, the painting was loaned for the only time, to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. On 15 April 1958, a fire there, which killed one person on the second floor of the museum, forced the emergency evacuation of the painting, which had been on a floor above the fire, to the Whitney Museum, which adjoined MoMA at the time.

==In popular culture==

The painting is the basis for the 1984 Broadway musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine, which tells a fictionalized story of the painting&#x27;s creation. Subsequently, the painting is sometimes referred to by the misnomer &quot;Sunday in the Park&quot;.

In Topiary Park (formerly Old Deaf School Park) in Columbus, Ohio, sculptor James T. Mason re-created the painting in topiary form; the installation was completed in 1989.

The 1986 John Hughes film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; featured the painting during a scene at the Art Institute of Chicago. 

The painting is featured in the 80s Lucasarts computer games Maniac Mansion and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

<text>The Faraday effect or Faraday rotation, sometimes referred to as the magneto-optic Faraday effect (MOFE), is a physical magneto-optical phenomenon. The Faraday effect causes a polarization rotation which is proportional to the projection of the magnetic field along the direction of the light propagation. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the dielectric permittivity tensor is diagonal. This effect occurs in most optically transparent dielectric materials (including liquids) under the influence of magnetic fields.

Discovered by Michael Faraday in 1845, the Faraday effect was the first experimental evidence that light and electromagnetism are related. The theoretical basis of electromagnetic radiation (which includes visible light) was completed by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s. Maxwell&#x27;s equations were rewritten in their current form in the 1870s by Oliver Heaviside.

The Faraday effect is caused by left and right circularly polarized waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite handedness and different phase, the effect of a relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave&#x27;s linear polarization.

The Faraday effect has applications in measuring instruments. For instance, the Faraday effect has been used to measure optical rotatory power and for remote sensing of magnetic fields (such as fiber optic current sensors). The Faraday effect is used in spintronics research to study the polarization of electron spins in semiconductors. Faraday rotators can be used for amplitude modulation of light, and are the basis of optical isolators and optical circulators; such components are required in optical telecommunications and other laser applications.

==History==

By 1845, it was known through the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, Étienne-Louis Malus, and others that different materials are able to modify the direction of polarization of light when appropriately oriented, making polarized light a very powerful tool to investigate the properties of transparent materials. Faraday firmly believed that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon, and as such should be affected by electromagnetic forces. He spent considerable effort looking for evidence of electric forces affecting the polarization of light through what are now known as electro-optic effects, starting with decomposing electrolytes. However, his experimental methods were not sensitive enough, and the effect was only measured thirty years later by John Kerr.

Faraday then attempted to look for the effects of magnetic forces on light passing through various substances. After several unsuccessful trials, he happened to test a piece of &quot;heavy&quot; glass, containing equal proportions of silica, boracic acid and lead oxide, that he had made during his earlier work on glass manufacturing. Faraday observed that when a beam of polarized light passed through the glass in the direction of an applied magnetic force, the polarization of light rotated by an angle that was proportional to the strength of the force. He used a Nicol prism to measure the polarization. He was later able to reproduce the effect in several other solids, liquids, and gases by procuring stronger electromagnets.

The discovery is well documented in Faraday&#x27;s daily notebook. On 13 Sept. 1845, in paragraph #7504, under the rubric &quot;Heavy Glass&quot;, he wrote:

He summarized the results of his experiments on 30 Sept. 1845, in paragraph #7718, famously writing:
==Physical interpretation==
The linear polarized light that is seen to rotate in the Faraday effect can be seen as consisting of the superposition of a right- and a left- circularly polarized beam (this superposition principle is fundamental in many branches of physics). We can look at the effects of each component (right- or left-polarized) separately, and see what effect this has on the result.

In circularly polarized light the direction of the electric field rotates at the frequency of the light, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In a material, this electric field causes a force on the charged particles that compose the material (because of their large charge to mass ratio, the electrons are most heavily affected). The motion thus effected will be circular, and circularly moving charges will create their own (magnetic) field in addition to the external magnetic field. There will thus be two different cases: the created field will be parallel to the external field for one (circular) polarization, and in the opposing direction for the other polarization direction – thus the net B field is enhanced in one direction and diminished in the opposite direction. This changes the dynamics of the interaction for each beam and one of the beams will be slowed more than the other, causing a phase difference between the left- and right-polarized beam. When the two beams are added after this phase shift, the result is again a linearly polarized beam, but with a rotation of the polarization vector.

The direction of polarization rotation depends on the properties of the material through which the light is shone. A full treatment would have to take into account the effect of the external and radiation-induced fields on the wave function of the electrons, and then calculate the effect of this change on the refractive index of the material for each polarization, to see whether the right- or left-circular polarization is slowed more.

==Mathematical formulation==

Formally, the magnetic permeability is treated as a non-diagonal tensor as expressed by the equation:

:formula_1

The relation between the angle of rotation of the polarization and the magnetic field in a transparent material is:

:formula_2

where

:β is the angle of rotation (in radians)
:&quot;B&quot; is the magnetic flux density in the direction of propagation (in teslas)
:&quot;d&quot; is the length of the path (in meters) where the light and magnetic field interact
:formula_3 is the Verdet constant for the material. This empirical proportionality constant (in units of radians per tesla per meter) varies with wavelength and temperature and is tabulated for various materials.

A positive Verdet constant corresponds to L-rotation (anticlockwise) when the direction of propagation is parallel to the magnetic field and to R-rotation (clockwise) when the direction of propagation is anti-parallel. Thus, if a ray of light is passed through a material and reflected back through it, the rotation doubles.

Some materials, such as terbium gallium garnet (TGG) have extremely high Verdet constants (≈ for 632 nm light). By placing a rod of this material in a strong magnetic field, Faraday rotation angles of over 0.78 rad (45°) can be achieved. This allows the construction of Faraday rotators, which are the principal component of Faraday isolators, devices which transmit light in only one direction. The Faraday effect can, however, be observed and measured in a Terbium-doped glass with Verdet constant as low as (≈ for 632 nm light). Similar isolators are constructed for microwave systems by using ferrite rods in a waveguide with a surrounding magnetic field. A thorough mathematical description can be found here.

== Examples ==
=== Interstellar medium ===
The effect is imposed on light over the course of its propagation from its origin to the Earth, through the interstellar medium. Here, the effect is caused by free electrons and can be characterized as a difference in the refractive index seen by the two circularly polarized propagation modes. Hence, in contrast to the Faraday effect in solids or liquids, interstellar Faraday rotation (β) has a simple dependence on the wavelength of light (λ), namely:

:formula_4

where the overall strength of the effect is characterized by RM, the rotation measure. This in turn depends on the axial component of the interstellar magnetic field &quot;B||&quot;, and the number density of electrons &quot;ne&quot;, both of which vary along the propagation path. In Gaussian cgs units the rotation measure is given by:
:formula_5

or in SI units:
:formula_6

where
:&quot;ne(s)&quot; is the density of electrons at each point &quot;s&quot; along the path
:&quot;B‖(s)&quot; is the component of the interstellar magnetic field in the direction of propagation at each point &quot;s&quot; along the path
:&quot;e&quot; is the charge of an electron;
:&quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum;
:&quot;m&quot; is the mass of an electron;
:formula_7 is the vacuum permittivity;

The integral is taken over the entire path from the source to the observer.

Faraday rotation is an important tool in astronomy for the measurement of magnetic fields, which can be estimated from rotation measures given a knowledge of the electron number density. In the case of radio pulsars, the dispersion caused by these electrons results in a time delay between pulses received at different wavelengths, which can be measured in terms of the electron column density, or dispersion measure. A measurement of both the dispersion measure and the rotation measure therefore yields the weighted mean of the magnetic field along the line of sight. The same information can be obtained from objects other than pulsars, if the dispersion measure can be estimated based on reasonable guesses about the propagation path length and typical electron densities. In particular, Faraday rotation measurements of polarized radio signals from extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona can be used to estimate both the electron density distribution and the direction and strength of the magnetic field in the coronal plasma.

=== Ionosphere ===
Radio waves passing through the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation according to the above equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the sunspot cycle, the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500 MHz (λ = 60 cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.

=== Semiconductors ===

Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs single crystal exhibits much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, one might think the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600 nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one might be able to use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.

More generally, (ferromagnetic) semiconductors return both electro-gyration and a Faraday response in the high frequency domain. The combination of the two is described by gyroelectromagnetic media, for which gyroelectricity and gyromagnetism (Faraday effect) may occur at the same time.

=== Organic materials ===
In organic materials, Faraday rotation is typically small, with a Verdet constant in the visible wavelength region on the order of a few hundred degrees per Tesla per meter, decreasing proportional to formula_8 in this region. While the Verdet constant of organic materials does increase around electronic transitions in the molecule, the associated light absorption makes most organic materials bad candidates for applications. There are however also isolated reports of large Faraday rotation in organic liquid crystals without associated absorption.

=== Plasmonic and magnetic materials ===

In 2009 γ-Fe2O3-Au core-shell nanostructures were synthesized to integrate magnetic (γ-Fe2O3) and plasmonic (Au) properties into one composite. Faraday rotation with and without the plasmonic materials was tested and rotation enhancement under 530 nm light irradiation was observed. Researchers claim that the magnitude of the magneto-optical enhancement is governed primarily by the spectral overlap of the magneto-optical transition and the plasmon resonance.

The reported composite magnetic/plasmonic nanostructure can be visualized to be a magnetic particle embedded in a resonant optical cavity. Because of the large density of photon states in the cavity, the interaction between the electromagnetic field of the light and the electronic transitions of the magnetic material is enhanced, resulting in a larger difference between the velocities of the right- and left-hand circularized polarization, therefore enhancing Faraday rotation.

<text>In mathematics, a regular polytope is a polytope whose symmetry group acts transitively on its flags, thus giving it the highest degree of symmetry. In particular, all its elements or -faces (for all , where is the dimension of the polytope) — cells, faces and so on — are also transitive on the symmetries of the polytope, and are themselves regular polytopes of dimension .

Regular polytopes are the generalised analog in any number of dimensions of regular polygons (for example, the square or the regular pentagon) and regular polyhedra (for example, the cube). The strong symmetry of the regular polytopes gives them an aesthetic quality that interests both mathematicians and non-mathematicians.

Classically, a regular polytope in dimensions may be defined as having regular facets (-faces) and regular vertex figures. These two conditions are sufficient to ensure that all faces are alike and all vertices are alike. Note, however, that this definition does not work for abstract polytopes.

A regular polytope can be represented by a Schläfli symbol of the form with regular facets as and regular vertex figures as 

==Classification and description==
Regular polytopes are classified primarily according to their dimension.

Three classes of regular polytopes exist in every number of dimensions:
*Regular simplex
*Measure polytope (Hypercube)
*Cross polytope (Orthoplex)
Any other regular polytope is said to be exceptional.

In one dimension, the line segment simultaneously serves as the 1-simplex, the 1-hypercube and the 1-orthoplex.
In two dimensions, there are infinitely many regular polygons, namely the regular &quot;n&quot;-sided polygon for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3. The triangle is the 2-simplex. The square is both the 2-hypercube and the 2-orthoplex. The &quot;n&quot;-sided polygons for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 5 are exceptional. 

In three and four dimensions, there are several more exceptional regular polyhedra and 4-polytopes respectively.

In five dimensions and above, the simplex, hypercube and orthoplex are the only regular polytopes. There are no exceptional regular polytopes in these dimensions. 

Regular polytopes can be further classified according to symmetry. For example, the cube and the regular octahedron share the same symmetry, as do the regular dodecahedron and regular icosahedron. Two distinct regular polytopes with the same symmetry are dual to one another. Indeed, symmetry groups are sometimes named after regular polytopes, for example the tetrahedral and icosahedral symmetries.

The idea of a polytope is sometimes generalised to include related kinds of geometrical object. Some of these have regular examples, as discussed in the section on historical discovery below.

===Schläfli symbols===
A concise symbolic representation for regular polytopes was developed by Ludwig Schläfli in the 19th century, and a slightly modified form has become standard. The notation is best explained by adding one dimension at a time.

*A convex regular polygon having &quot;n&quot; sides is denoted by {&quot;n&quot;}. So an equilateral triangle is {3}, a square {4}, and so on indefinitely. A regular &quot;n&quot;-sided star polygon which winds &quot;m&quot; times around its centre is denoted by the fractional value {&quot;n&quot;/&quot;m&quot;}, where &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are co-prime, so a regular pentagram is {5/2}.
*A regular polyhedron having faces {&quot;n&quot;} with &quot;p&quot; faces joining around a vertex is denoted by {&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;}. The nine regular polyhedra are {3, 3}; {3, 4}; {4, 3}; {3, 5}; {5, 3}; {3, 5/2}; {5/2, 3}; {5, 5/2}; and {5/2, 5}. {&quot;p&quot;} is the &quot;vertex figure&quot; of the polyhedron.
*A regular 4-polytope having cells {&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;} with &quot;q&quot; cells joining around an edge is denoted by {&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;}. The vertex figure of the 4-polytope is a {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;}.
*A regular 5-polytope is an {&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;}. And so on.

===Duality of the regular polytopes===

The dual of a regular polytope is also a regular polytope. The Schläfli symbol for the dual polytope is just the original symbol written backwards: {3, 3} is self-dual, {3, 4} is dual to {4, 3}, {4, 3, 3} to {3, 3, 4} and so on.

The vertex figure of a regular polytope is the dual of the dual polytope&#x27;s facet. For example, the vertex figure of {3, 3, 4} is {3, 4}, the dual of which is {4, 3} — a cell of {4, 3, 3}.

The measure and cross polytopes in any dimension are dual to each other.

If the Schläfli symbol is palindromic (i.e. reads the same forwards and backwards), then the polytope is self-dual. The self-dual regular polytopes are:
* All regular polygons - {a}.
* All regular &quot;n&quot;-simplexes - {3,3...,3}.
* The regular 24-cell - {3,4,3} - in 4 dimensions.
* The great 120-cell - {5,5/2,5} - and grand stellated 120-cell - {5/2,5,5/2} - in 4 dimensions.
* All regular &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercubic honeycombs - {4,3...,3,4}. These may be treated as infinite polytopes.
* Hyperbolic tilings and honeycombs (tilings {p,p} with p&gt;4 in 2 dimensions; {4,4,4}, {5,3,5}. {3,5,3}, {6,3,6}, and {3,6,3} in 3 dimensions; {5,3,3,5} in 4 dimensions; and {3,3,4,3,3} in 5 dimensions).

===Regular simplices===

These are the regular simplices or simplexes. Their names are, in order of dimension:

:0. Point
:1. Line segment
:2. Equilateral triangle (regular trigon)
:3. Regular tetrahedron
:4. Regular pentachoron &quot;or&quot; 4-simplex
:5. Regular hexateron &quot;or&quot; 5-simplex
:... An &quot;n&quot;-simplex has &quot;n&quot;+1 vertices.

The process of making each simplex can be visualised on a graph: Begin with a point &quot;A&quot;. Mark point &quot;B&quot; at a distance &quot;r&quot; from it, and join to form a line segment. Mark point &quot;C&quot; in a second, orthogonal, dimension at a distance &quot;r&quot; from both, and join to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to form an equilateral triangle. Mark point &quot;D&quot; in a third, orthogonal, dimension a distance &quot;r&quot; from all three, and join to form a regular tetrahedron. This process is repeated further using new points to form higher-dimensional simplices.

===Measure polytopes (hypercubes)===

These are the measure polytopes or hypercubes. Their names are, in order of dimension:

:0. Point
:1. Line segment
:2. Square (regular tetragon)
:3. Cube (regular hexahedron)
:4. Tesseract (regular octachoron) &quot;or&quot; 4-cube
:5. Penteract (regular decateron) &quot;or&quot; 5-cube
:... An &quot;n&quot;-cube has &quot;2n&quot; vertices.

The process of making each hypercube can be visualised on a graph: Begin with a point &quot;A&quot;. Extend a line to point &quot;B&quot; at distance &quot;r&quot;, and join to form a line segment. Extend a second line of length &quot;r&quot;, orthogonal to &quot;AB&quot;, from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, and likewise from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;D&quot;, to form a square &quot;ABCD&quot;. Extend lines of length &quot;r&quot; respectively from each corner, orthogonal to both &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; (i.e. upwards). Mark new points &quot;E&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;,&quot;H&quot; to form the cube &quot;ABCDEFGH&quot;. This process is repeated further using new lines to form higher-dimensional hypercubes.

===Cross polytopes (orthoplexes)===

These are the cross polytopes or orthoplexes. Their names are, in order of dimensionality:

:0. Point
:1. Line segment
:2. Square (regular tetragon)
:3. Regular octahedron
:4. Regular hexadecachoron (16-cell) &quot;or&quot; 4-orthoplex
:5. Regular triacontakaiditeron (Pentacross) &quot;or&quot; 5-orthoplex
:... An &quot;n&quot;-orthoplex has &quot;2n&quot; vertices.

The process of making each orthoplex can be visualised on a graph: Begin with a point &quot;O&quot;. Extend a line in opposite directions to points &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; a distance &quot;r&quot; from &quot;O&quot; and 2&quot;r&quot; apart. Draw a line &quot;COD&quot; of length 2&quot;r&quot;, centred on &quot;O&quot; and orthogonal to &quot;AB&quot;. Join the ends to form a square &quot;ACBD&quot;. Draw a line &quot;EOF&quot; of the same length and centered on &#x27;O&#x27;, orthogonal to &quot;AB&quot; and &quot;CD&quot; (i.e. upwards and downwards). Join the ends to the square to form a regular octahedron. This process is repeated further using new lines to form higher-dimensional orthoplices.

===Classification by Coxeter groups===

Regular polytopes can be classified by their isometry group. These are finite Coxeter groups, but not every finite Coxeter group may be realised as the isometry group of a regular polytope. Regular polytopes are in bijection with Coxeter groups with linear Coxeter-Dynkin diagram (without branch point) and an increasing numbering of the nodes. Reversing the numbering gives the dual polytope.

The classification of finite Coxeter groups, which goes back to , therefore implies the classification of regular polytopes:
* Type formula_1, the symmetric group, gives the regular simplex,
*Type formula_2, gives the measure polytope and the cross polytope (both can be distinguished by the increasing numbering of the nodes of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram),
* Exceptional types formula_3 give the regular polygons (with formula_4),
* Exceptional type formula_5 gives the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron (again the numbering allows to distinguish them),
* Exceptional type formula_6 gives the 120-cell and the 600-cell,
* Exceptional type formula_7 gives the 24-cell, which is self-dual.

The bijection between regular polytopes and Coxeter groups with linear Coxeter-Dynkin diagram can be understood as follows. Consider a regular polytope formula_8 of dimension formula_9 and take its barycentric subdivision. The fundamental domain of the isometry group action on formula_8 is given by any simplex formula_11 in the barycentric subdivision. The simplex formula_11 has formula_13 vertices which can be numbered from 0 to formula_9 by the dimension of the corresponding face of formula_8 (the face they are the barycenter of). The isometry group of formula_8 is generated by the formula_9 reflections around the hyperplanes of formula_11 containing the vertex number formula_9 (since the barycenter of the whole polytope formula_8 is fixed by any isometry). These formula_9 hyperplanes can be numbered by the vertex of formula_11 they do not contain. The remaining thing to check is that any two hyperplanes with adjacent numbers cannot be orthogonal, whereas hyperplanes with non-adjacent numbers are orthogonal. This can be done using induction (since all facets of formula_8 are again regular polytopes). Therefore, the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram of the isometry group of formula_8 has formula_9 vertices numbered from 0 to formula_26 such that adjacent numbers are linked by at least one edge and non-adjacent numbers are not linked.

==History of discovery==

===Convex polygons and polyhedra===

The earliest surviving mathematical treatment of regular polygons and polyhedra comes to us from ancient Greek mathematicians. The five Platonic solids were known to them. Pythagoras knew of at least three of them and Theaetetus (c. 417 BC – 369 BC) described all five. Later, Euclid wrote a systematic study of mathematics, publishing it under the title &quot;Elements&quot;, which built up a logical theory of geometry and number theory. His work concluded with mathematical descriptions of the five Platonic solids.

===Star polygons and polyhedra===

Our understanding remained static for many centuries after Euclid. The subsequent history of the regular polytopes can be characterised by a gradual broadening of the basic concept, allowing more and more objects to be considered among their number. Thomas Bradwardine (Bradwardinus) was the first to record a serious study of star polygons. Various star polyhedra appear in Renaissance art, but it was not until Johannes Kepler studied the small stellated dodecahedron and the great stellated dodecahedron in 1619 that he realised these two polyhedra were regular. Louis Poinsot discovered the great dodecahedron and great icosahedron in 1809, and Augustin Cauchy proved the list complete in 1812. These polyhedra are known as collectively as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.

===Higher-dimensional polytopes===
It was not until the 19th century that a Swiss mathematician, Ludwig Schläfli, examined and characterised the regular polytopes in higher dimensions. His efforts were first published in full in , six years posthumously, although parts of it were published in and . Between 1880 and 1900, Schläfli&#x27;s results were rediscovered independently by at least nine other mathematicians — see for more details. Schläfli called such a figure a &quot;polyschem&quot; (in English, &quot;polyscheme&quot; or &quot;polyschema&quot;). The term &quot;polytope&quot; was introduced by Reinhold Hoppe, one of Schläfli&#x27;s rediscoverers, in 1882, and first used in English by Alicia Boole Stott some twenty years later. The term &quot;polyhedroids&quot; was also used in earlier literature (Hilbert, 1952).

 is probably the most comprehensive printed treatment of Schläfli&#x27;s and similar results to date. Schläfli showed that there are six regular convex polytopes in 4 dimensions. Five of them can be seen as analogous to the Platonic solids: the 4-simplex (or pentachoron) to the tetrahedron, the hypercube (or tesseract) to the cube, the 4-orthoplex (or hexadecachoron or 16-cell) to the octahedron, the 120-cell to the dodecahedron, and the 600-cell to the icosahedron. The sixth, the 24-cell, can be seen as a transitional form between the hypercube and 16-cell, analogous to the way that the cuboctahedron and the rhombic dodecahedron are transitional forms between the cube and the octahedron.

In five and more dimensions, there are exactly three regular polytopes, which correspond to the tetrahedron, cube and octahedron: these are the regular simplices, measure polytopes and cross polytopes. Descriptions of these may be found in the list of regular polytopes. Also of interest are the star regular 4-polytopes, partially discovered by Schläfli.

By the end of the 19th century, mathematicians such as Arthur Cayley and Ludwig Schläfli had developed the theory of regular polytopes in four and higher dimensions, such as the tesseract and the 24-cell.

The latter are difficult (though not impossible) to visualise through a process of dimensional analogy, since they retain the familiar symmetry of their lower-dimensional analogues. The tesseract contains 8 cubical cells. It consists of two cubes in parallel hyperplanes with corresponding vertices cross-connected in such a way that the 8 cross-edges are equal in length and orthogonal to the 12+12 edges situated on each cube. The corresponding faces of the two cubes are connected to form the remaining 6 cubical faces of the tesseract. The 24-cell can be derived from the tesseract by joining the 8 vertices of each of its cubical faces to an additional vertex to form the four-dimensional analogue of a pyramid. Both figures, as well as other 4-dimensional figures, can be directly visualised and depicted using 4-dimensional stereographs.

Harder still to imagine are the more modern abstract regular polytopes such as the 57-cell or the 11-cell. From the mathematical point of view, however, these objects have the same aesthetic qualities as their more familiar two and three-dimensional relatives.

At the start of the 20th century, the definition of a regular polytope was as follows.
*A regular polygon is a polygon whose edges are all equal and whose angles are all equal.
*A regular polyhedron is a polyhedron whose faces are all congruent regular polygons, and whose vertex figures are all congruent and regular.
*And so on, a regular &quot;n&quot;-polytope is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional polytope whose (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional faces are all regular and congruent, and whose vertex figures are all regular and congruent.

This is a &quot;recursive&quot; definition. It defines regularity of higher dimensional figures in terms of regular figures of a lower dimension. There is an equivalent (non-recursive) definition, which states that a polytope is regular if it has a sufficient degree of symmetry.

* An &quot;n&quot;-polytope is regular if any set consisting of a vertex, an edge containing it, a 2-dimensional face containing the edge, and so on up to &quot;n&quot;−1 dimensions, can be mapped to any other such set by a symmetry of the polytope.

So for example, the cube is regular because if we choose a vertex of the cube, and one of the three edges it is on, and one of the two faces containing the edge, then this triplet, known as a flag, (vertex, edge, face) can be mapped to any other such flag by a suitable symmetry of the cube. Thus we can define a regular polytope very succinctly:
*A regular polytope is one whose symmetry group is transitive on its flags.

In the 20th century, some important developments were made. The symmetry groups of the classical regular polytopes were generalised into what are now called Coxeter groups. Coxeter groups also include the symmetry groups of regular tessellations of space or of the plane. For example, the symmetry group of an infinite chessboard would be the Coxeter group [4,4].

===Apeirotopes — infinite polytopes===

In the first part of the 20th century, Coxeter and Petrie discovered three infinite structures {4, 6}, {6, 4} and {6, 6}. They called them regular skew polyhedra, because they seemed to satisfy the definition of a regular polyhedron — all the vertices, edges and faces are alike, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no free edges. Nowadays, they are called infinite polyhedra or apeirohedra. The regular tilings of the plane {4, 4}, {3, 6} and {6, 3} can also be regarded as infinite polyhedra.

In the 1960s Branko Grünbaum issued a call to the geometric community to consider more abstract types of regular polytopes that he called &quot;polystromata&quot;. He developed the theory of polystromata, showing examples of new objects he called regular apeirotopes, that is, regular polytopes with infinitely many faces. A simple example of a skew apeirogon would be a zig-zag. It seems to satisfy the definition of a regular polygon — all the edges are the same length, all the angles are the same, and the figure has no loose ends (because they can never be reached). More importantly, perhaps, there are symmetries of the zig-zag that can map any pair of a vertex and attached edge to any other. Since then, other regular apeirogons and higher apeirotopes have continued to be discovered.

===Regular complex polytopes===

A complex number has a real part, which is the bit we are all familiar with, and an imaginary part, which is a multiple of the square root of minus one. A complex Hilbert space has its x, y, z, etc. coordinates as complex numbers. This effectively doubles the number of dimensions. A polytope constructed in such a unitary space is called a complex polytope.

===Abstract polytopes===

Grünbaum also discovered the 11-cell, a four-dimensional self-dual object whose facets are not icosahedra, but are &quot;hemi-icosahedra&quot; — that is, they are the shape one gets if one considers opposite faces of the icosahedra to be actually the &quot;same&quot; face . The hemi-icosahedron has only 10 triangular faces, and 6 vertices, unlike the icosahedron, which has 20 and 12.

This concept may be easier for the reader to grasp if one considers the relationship of the cube and the hemicube. An ordinary cube has 8 corners, they could be labeled A to H, with A opposite H, B opposite G, and so on. In a hemicube, A and H would be treated as the same corner. So would B and G, and so on. The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.

The 11-cell cannot be formed with regular geometry in flat (Euclidean) hyperspace, but only in positively curved (elliptic) hyperspace.

A few years after Grünbaum&#x27;s discovery of the 11-cell, H. S. M. Coxeter independently discovered the same shape. He had earlier discovered a similar polytope, the 57-cell (Coxeter 1982, 1984).

By 1994 Grünbaum was considering polytopes abstractly as combinatorial sets of points or vertices, and was unconcerned whether faces were planar. As he and others refined these ideas, such sets came to be called abstract polytopes. An abstract polytope is defined as a partially ordered set (poset), whose elements are the polytope&#x27;s faces (vertices, edges, faces etc.) ordered by &quot;containment&quot;. Certain restrictions are imposed on the set that are similar to properties satisfied by the classical regular polytopes (including the Platonic solids). The restrictions, however, are loose enough that regular tessellations, hemicubes, and even objects as strange as the 11-cell or stranger, are all examples of regular polytopes.

A geometric polytope is understood to be a &quot;realization&quot; of the abstract polytope, such that there is a one-to-one mapping from the abstract elements to the corresponding faces of the geometric realisation. Thus, any geometric polytope may be described by the appropriate abstract poset, though not all abstract polytopes have proper geometric realizations.

The theory has since been further developed, largely by , but other researchers have also made contributions.

====Regularity of abstract polytopes====
Regularity has a related, though different meaning for abstract polytopes, since angles and lengths of edges have no meaning.

The definition of regularity in terms of the transitivity of flags as given in the introduction applies to abstract polytopes.

Any classical regular polytope has an abstract equivalent which is regular, obtained by taking the set of faces. But non-regular classical polytopes can have regular abstract equivalents, since abstract polytopes do not retain information about angles and edge lengths, for example. And a regular abstract polytope may not be realisable as a classical polytope.

&quot;All polygons&quot; are regular in the abstract world, for example, whereas only those having equal angles and edges of equal length are regular in the classical world.

====Vertex figure of abstract polytopes====

The concept of &quot;vertex figure&quot; is also defined differently for an abstract polytope. The vertex figure of a given abstract &quot;n&quot;-polytope at a given vertex &quot;V&quot; is the set of all abstract faces which contain &quot;V&quot;, including &quot;V&quot; itself. More formally, it is the abstract section

: &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; / &quot;V&quot; = {&quot;F&quot; | &quot;V&quot; ≤ &quot;F&quot; ≤ &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;}

where &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the maximal face, i.e. the notional &quot;n&quot;-face which contains all other faces. Note that each &quot;i&quot;-face, &quot;i&quot; ≥ 0 of the original polytope becomes an (&quot;i&quot; − 1)-face of the vertex figure.

Unlike the case for Euclidean polytopes, an abstract polytope with regular facets and vertex figures &quot;may or may not&quot; be regular itself – for example, the square pyramid, all of whose facets and vertex figures are regular abstract polygons.

The classical vertex figure will, however, be a realisation of the abstract one.

== Constructions ==

=== Polygons ===

The traditional way to construct a regular polygon, or indeed any other figure on the plane, is by compass and straightedge. Constructing some regular polygons in this way is very simple (the easiest is perhaps the equilateral triangle), some are more complex, and some are impossible (&quot;not constructible&quot;). The simplest few regular polygons that are impossible to construct are the &quot;n&quot;-sided polygons with &quot;n&quot; equal to 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21...

Constructibility in this sense refers only to ideal constructions with ideal tools. Of course reasonably accurate approximations can be constructed by a range of methods; while theoretically possible constructions may be impractical.

=== Polyhedra ===

Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; gave what amount to ruler-and-compass constructions for the five Platonic solids. However, the merely practical question of how one might draw a straight line in space, even with a ruler, might lead one to question what exactly it means to &quot;construct&quot; a regular polyhedron. (One could ask the same question about the polygons, of course.)

The English word &quot;construct&quot; has the connotation of systematically building the thing constructed. The most common way presented to construct a regular polyhedron is via a fold-out net. To obtain a fold-out net of a polyhedron, one takes the surface of the polyhedron and cuts it along just enough edges so that the surface may be laid out flat. This gives a plan for the net of the unfolded polyhedron. Since the Platonic solids have only triangles, squares and pentagons for faces, and these are all constructible with a ruler and compass, there exist ruler-and-compass methods for drawing these fold-out nets. The same applies to star polyhedra, although here we must be careful to make the net for only the visible outer surface.

If this net is drawn on cardboard, or similar foldable material (for example, sheet metal), the net may be cut out, folded along the uncut edges, joined along the appropriate cut edges, and so forming the polyhedron for which the net was designed. For a given polyhedron there may be many fold-out nets. For example, there are 11 for the cube, and over 900000 for the dodecahedron.

Numerous children&#x27;s toys, generally aimed at the teen or pre-teen age bracket, allow experimentation with regular polygons and polyhedra. For example, klikko provides sets of plastic triangles, squares, pentagons and hexagons that can be joined edge-to-edge in a large number of different ways. A child playing with such a toy could rediscover the Platonic solids (or the Archimedean solids), especially if given a little guidance from a knowledgeable adult.

In theory, almost any material may be used to construct regular polyhedra. They may be carved out of wood, modeled out of wire, formed from stained glass. The imagination is the limit.

=== Higher dimensions ===

In higher dimensions, it becomes harder to say what one means by &quot;constructing&quot; the objects. Clearly, in a 3-dimensional universe, it is impossible to build a physical model of an object having 4 or more dimensions. There are several approaches normally taken to overcome this matter.

The first approach, suitable for four dimensions, uses four-dimensional stereography. Depth in a third dimension is represented with horizontal relative displacement, depth in a fourth dimension with vertical relative displacement between the left and right images of the stereograph.

The second approach is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous to the ways in which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron&#x27;s fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to &quot;draw&quot; the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter&#x27;s famous book on polytopes has some examples of such orthographic projections. Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are 3-d models of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).

The intersection of a four (or higher) dimensional regular polytope with a three-dimensional hyperplane will be a polytope (not necessarily regular). If the hyperplane is moved through the shape, the three-dimensional slices can be combined, animated into a kind of four dimensional object, where the fourth dimension is taken to be time. In this way, we can see (if not fully grasp) the full four-dimensional structure of the four-dimensional regular polytopes, via such cutaway cross sections. This is analogous to the way a CAT scan reassembles two-dimensional images to form a 3-dimensional representation of the organs being scanned. The ideal would be an animated hologram of some sort, however, even a simple animation such as the one shown can already give some limited insight into the structure of the polytope.

Another way a three-dimensional viewer can comprehend the structure of a four-dimensional polytope is through being &quot;immersed&quot; in the object, perhaps via some form of virtual reality technology. To understand how this might work, imagine what one would see if space were filled with cubes. The viewer would be inside one of the cubes, and would be able to see cubes in front of, behind, above, below, to the left and right of himself. If one could travel in these directions, one could explore the array of cubes, and gain an understanding of its geometrical structure. An infinite array of cubes is not a polytope in the traditional sense. In fact, it is a tessellation of 3-dimensional (Euclidean) space. However, a 4-polytope can be considered a tessellation of a 3-dimensional non-Euclidean space, namely, a tessellation of the surface of a four-dimensional sphere (a 4-dimensional spherical tiling).
Locally, this space seems like the one we are familiar with, and therefore, a virtual-reality system could, in principle, be programmed to allow exploration of these &quot;tessellations&quot;, that is, of the 4-dimensional regular polytopes. The mathematics department at UIUC has a number of pictures of what one would see if embedded in a tessellation of hyperbolic space with dodecahedra. Such a tessellation forms an example of an infinite abstract regular polytope.

Normally, for abstract regular polytopes, a mathematician considers that the object is &quot;constructed&quot; if the structure of its symmetry group is known. This is because of an important theorem in the study of abstract regular polytopes, providing a technique that allows the abstract regular polytope to be constructed from its symmetry group in a standard and straightforward manner.

<text>Jennifer Kate Hudson (born September 12, 1981), also known by her nickname J.Hud, is an American singer and actress. Having received numerous accolades for her work in music, film, television, and theater, Hudson became the youngest woman and third African-American recipient of all four major American entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT) in 2022. She was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013, and &quot;Time&quot; named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2020.

Hudson rose to fame in 2004 as a finalist on the third season of the reality series &quot;American Idol&quot;, wherein she placed seventh. She signed with Arista Records to release her self-titled debut studio album (2008), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and won Best R&amp;B Album at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. Her second and third studio albums, &quot;I Remember Me&quot; (2011) and &quot;JHUD&quot; (2014), both peaked within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; the latter was released by RCA Records. She signed with Interscope to release her fourth and first Christmas album, &quot;The Gift of Love&quot; (2024), her first solo project in a decade.

She made her film debut as Effie White in the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; (2006), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and became the youngest African-American recipient of the award. She has since portrayed Aretha Franklin in the musical biopic &quot;Respect&quot; (2021) and acted in films such as &quot;Sex and the City&quot; (2008), &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; (2008), &quot;Winnie Mandela&quot; (2011), &quot;Black Nativity&quot; (2013), &quot;Sing&quot; (2016), &quot;Cats&quot; (2019). She also has appeared in shows such as &quot;Smash&quot; (2012), &quot;Empire&quot; (2015) and &quot;Confirmation&quot; (2016).

On stage, she acted in the Broadway musical revival &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (2015) and won the Tony Award for Best Musical as a producer of &quot;A Strange Loop&quot; (2022). Hudson has served as a coach on both the UK and the US versions of the reality series &quot;The Voice&quot; from 2017 to 2019, and became the first female coach to lead a winning team on the former. Since 2022, she has hosted her own talk show, &quot;The Jennifer Hudson Show&quot;.

==Early life==
Hudson was born in Chicago, Illinois. She is the third and youngest child of Darnell Donerson and Samuel Simpson, a Greyhound Lines bus driver. She, her older sister Julia, a school bus driver, and her brother Jason Hudson, were raised primarily by their mother. Her father was absent from her childhood until, with the blessing of her mother, she went looking for him at age 14. When Hudson found her father, she learned that he had 26 other children. She has stated she has still not met all of her half-siblings.

She was raised as a Baptist in Englewood and attended Dunbar Vocational High School, from which she graduated in 1999. She cites Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, and Patti LaBelle as her overall biggest influences and inspiration. She has also credited Mariah Carey as being one of her musical &quot;heroes&quot;. At age 7 she got her start in performing by singing with the church choir and doing community theater with the help of her late maternal grandmother, Julia. She enrolled at Langston University but she left after a semester due to homesickness and unhappiness with the weather, and registered at Kennedy–King College.

In January 2002, Hudson signed her first recording contract with Righteous Records, a Chicago-based independent record label. She was released from her five-year contract with Righteous Records so that she could appear on &quot;American Idol&quot; in 2004.

==Career==
===2004–2005: &quot;American Idol&quot;===
Hudson auditioned for the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in Atlanta. After commenting that she had been singing on Disney Cruise Lines (aboard the Disney Wonder) for the past few months as one of the Muses from &quot;Hercules&quot;, judge Randy Jackson told her, &quot;We&#x27;re expecting more than a cruise ship performance from you.&quot; Hudson received the highest number of votes in the &quot;Top 9&quot; after her performance of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Circle of Life&quot; on April 6, 2004, but two weeks later, she was eliminated during the &quot;Top 7&quot; show after performing Barry Manilow&#x27;s, &quot;Weekend in New England&quot;. In May 2009, &quot;MTV&quot; listed Hudson as the sixth greatest contestant in &quot;American Idol&quot; history and noted her exit was the most shocking of all time. In May 2010, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed Hudson to be the third greatest &quot;Idol&quot; contestant in the history of the show, placing behind season one winner Kelly Clarkson and season four winner Carrie Underwood respectively.

====Performances====
===2006–2007: &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; and breakthrough===
In one of her first appearances on a record, Hudson is featured in a duet, &quot;The Future Ain&#x27;t What It Used to Be&quot;, on Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;. In September 2006, Hudson performed the song, &quot;Over It&quot;, live on Fox Chicago Morning News. In the interview she stated the song would be included on her debut album, to be released in early 2007; however, this was before she was signed to a record label. In November 2006, Hudson signed a record deal with Arista Records. Hudson also recorded a song she co-wrote with Bill Grainer and Earl Powell called &quot;Stand Up&quot;, which was available for preview on her fan website. The track was produced by Chicago natives Powell and Herman Little III, who also arranged the song. The power-ballad would later become available on the deluxe edition of Hudson&#x27;s self-titled album as a bonus track.

In November 2005, Hudson was cast in the role of Effie White for the film adaptation of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, which also starred Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé Knowles and Eddie Murphy. The role marked Hudson&#x27;s debut screen performance. She won the role over hundreds of professional singers and actresses, including Fantasia Barrino. Filming of &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; began on January 9, 2006, and the film went into limited release on December 25, 2006, and national release on January 12, 2007. Hudson has won particular praise for her show-stopping onscreen rendition of the hit song, &quot;And I Am Telling You I&#x27;m Not Going&quot;, the signature song of the role, which had earlier been recorded, and had already reached the status of musical standard, because of the definitive performance of Jennifer Holliday. &quot;The New York Observer&quot; described Hudson&#x27;s performance of the song as &quot;five mellifluous, &quot;molto vibrato&quot; minutes that have suddenly catapulted Ms. Hudson... into the position of front-runner for the best supporting actress Oscar&quot;. &quot;Newsweek&quot; said that when moviegoers hear Hudson sing the song, she, &quot;is going to raise goose bumps across the land.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote that Hudson&#x27;s performance &quot;calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in &quot;Funny Girl&quot; or Bette Midler in &quot;The Rose&quot;, with a voice like the young Aretha&quot;.
&quot;Love You I Do&quot; was nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Original Song and won the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media.

As Effie White, Hudson has garnered 29 awards from film critics as Best Supporting Actress and Breakthrough Performer of 2006. She won the Golden Globe Award as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In addition, she has been named Best Supporting Actress by the Broadcast Film Critics Association and also by the Screen Actors Guild. After seeing Hudson&#x27;s performance in &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, Simon Cowell taped a congratulatory message to her, which aired on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. With the March 2007 issue, Jennifer Hudson became the third African-American celebrity and the first African-American singer to grace the cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine.
On February 11, 2007, the 60th British Academy Film Awards were held in London, but Hudson was not there to accept her BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. The BAFTA Award went missing and Hudson did not receive her award until April 22, 2011, when it was presented to her on the &quot;Graham Norton Show&quot;.
On February 25, 2007, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.
Later in 2007, the mayor of her home town, Chicago, Richard M. Daley, declared March 6 as &quot;Jennifer Hudson Day&quot;. She was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on June 18, along with 115 other individuals for 2007. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put her performance on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Sure, Beyoncé&#x27;s performance was great. And Eddie Murphy&#x27;s was impressive. But there was really only one reason we all rushed to see 2006&#x27;s Dreamgirls: Jennifer Hudson&#x27;s soul-to-the-rafters rendition of the classic &#x27;And I&#x27;m Telling You I&#x27;m Not Going&#x27;. When she sang &#x27;You&#x27;re gonna love me,&#x27; it wasn&#x27;t just a lyric — it was a fact.&quot;

===2008–2009: &quot;Jennifer Hudson&quot; album and films===
In May 2008, Hudson appeared in the feature film &quot;Sex and the City&quot; as Louise, Carrie Bradshaw&#x27;s assistant. Filming finished in December 2007 and the movie was released on May 30, 2008.
In October 2008, Hudson made her third film appearance in &quot;The Secret Life of Bees&quot; as Rosaleen, the mother figure of Lily Owens (Dakota Fanning). Also starring in the film are fellow Oscar nominees Queen Latifah and Sophie Okonedo, as well as Alicia Keys. The film opened on October 17, 2008, and grossed over $37 million at the box office. The film won two People&#x27;s Choice Awards in January 2009 in the categories, Favorite Drama Movie and Favorite Independent Movie. The film also received nine Black Reel Awards nominations including three wins. Hudson was nominated for her performance in the film, but lost to Queen Latifah. The film also received eight nominations at the 2009 NAACP Image Awards, including a nomination for Hudson for her performance.

In 2009, Hudson starred as Kathy Archenault in &quot;Fragments&quot;, a film based on the novel by Roy Freirich, with Dakota Fanning and Forest Whitaker. It was released on DVD on August 4, 2009. In 2010, Hudson started filming the biopic film &quot;Winnie Mandela&quot; based on the South African politician Winnie Mandela starring alongside Terrence Howard and directed by Darrell J. Roodt. Andre Pieterse and Roodt and Paul L. Johnson based the film&#x27;s script on Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob&#x27;s biography, &quot;Winnie Mandela: A Life&quot;. The Creative Workers Union of South Africa have opposed this choice, stating they will push for a moratorium on the film if the casting is not reversed. Winnie Mandela has threatened legal action over this film, claiming she was not &quot;consulted&quot; about the film. &quot;Winnie Mandela&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in December 2011; the trailer was released in 2010. Image Entertainment released the film on September 6, 2013.

In January 2008, Hudson returned to the studio to record new songs for her debut studio album. Her label was reportedly unhappy with the direction they were sending Hudson musically and decided it would be best to scrap the older songs and instead focus on new ones. Hudson worked with Ryan Tedder and Timbaland on a number of songs. Her debut single, &quot;Spotlight&quot; was released on June 10, 2008, and became Hudson&#x27;s first top 40 hit peaking at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became a top 20 hit in the United Kingdom and Turkey.
Her debut studio album, &quot;Jennifer Hudson&quot;, was released on September 30, 2008, on Arista and was written by Ne-Yo, who co-produced along with Stargate. Additional contributors on the album include Timbaland, Missy Elliott, Robin Thicke, Harvey Mason, Jr., Diane Warren, Earl Powell, and Christopher &quot;Tricky&quot; Stewart, among others. The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 217,000 copies in the US and opened to positive reviews. As of August 2009, the album has sold 739,000 copies in the US, receiving a Gold certification for surpassing sales of 500,000. She has performed the song, &quot;All Dressed in Love&quot; for the &quot;Sex and the City&quot; soundtrack, which was released on May 27, 2008. Hudson performed the national anthem at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

The album&#x27;s second single was to be released in October 2008, and was originally set to be &quot;My Heart&quot; before &quot;If This Isn&#x27;t Love&quot; was chosen as the official second single. After three of her family members were brutally murdered, the single was rescheduled for a January 2009 release. However, in January 2009, her label decided to postpone the release of the second single once more, choosing a February 2009 release date. After the release of &quot;If This Isn&#x27;t Love&quot;, the single eventually peaked at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 37 on the UK Singles Chart. The third single was &quot;Pocketbook&quot; featuring Ludacris in April 2009, for a June 2009 release, despite speculation that the third single would be &quot;My Heart&quot; after it was canceled as the second single. In May 2009, &quot;Pocketbook&quot; was canceled as the third single due to negative reception from fans and critics alike. The third single was then rescheduled as &quot;Giving Myself&quot; and was released on June 2, 2009, to the US. Her debut album garnered Hudson three nominations at the 2009 Grammy Awards: Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;Spotlight&quot;, Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for &quot;I&#x27;m His Only Woman&quot; with Fantasia Barrino, and Best R&amp;B Album for &quot;Jennifer Hudson&quot;. She won the last of these and performed at the awards ceremony.

In February 2009, Hudson made her first public appearance since the murders when she sang the &quot;Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Super Bowl XLIII. She toured the United States with Robin Thicke in 2009. In early May 2009, Hudson suffered &quot;throat fatigue&quot; and had to reschedule her May 16–19, 2009, tour dates. She sang &quot;Will You Be There&quot; at the Michael Jackson memorial service in July 2009. Hudson recorded &quot;Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)&quot;, originally by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, for &quot;American Idol Season 3: Greatest Soul Classics&quot; — the official &quot;American Idol&quot; album for the third season. She is featured on Ne-Yo&#x27;s second album, &quot;Because of You&quot;, on the track, &quot;Leaving Tonight&quot;. Hudson performed a Christmas special in December 2009 called &quot;Jennifer Hudson: I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. During the special, she relived her childhood Christmases with musical performances filmed at her favorite locations in her native Chicago. Hudson also visited family members, friends and other childhood influences during the broadcast. On January 22, 2010, Hudson appeared on the telethon &quot;Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief&quot;, performing the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let it Be&quot;. The telecast generated $61 million in donations . Also, that year, Hudson recorded the song &quot;One Shining Moment&quot; for the 2010 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament.

===2010–2012: Weight Watchers and &quot;I Remember Me&quot;===

In 2010, Hudson became the spokesperson for Weight Watchers. That year, she had lost and &quot;[did] not want to lose any more weight.&quot; However, on February 10, 2011, she appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and revealed she had lost a total of 80 pounds. Her 2012 autobiography, &quot;I Got This: How I Changed My Ways and Lost What Weighed Me Down&quot;, detailed her weight loss.

Early in the album &quot;I Remember Me&quot;″s development, Ne-Yo told &quot;E! Online&quot; that Hudson was ready to get personal on her second studio album and that he might be producing the album. He said &quot;She&#x27;s gone through a lot over the last year, so she has a lot to talk about&quot;, he continues. &quot;She&#x27;s definitely gotten stronger. The things that she&#x27;s gone through and for her to still be upbeat and happy, it&#x27;s amazing.&quot; Hudson released her second studio album &quot;I Remember Me&quot; on March 22, 2011. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 165,000 copies in its first week of release.
On January 24, 2011, Hudson premiered the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Where You At&quot;. It was written by R. Kelly and produced by Harvey Mason, Jr. The song went for radio adds that same week. On February 3, 2011, due to radio adds the single made its debut on the US Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart at number 53, having so far reached a peak of number 10.

<text>Jan Hammer () (born 17 April 1948) is a Czech-American musician, composer, and record producer. He rose to prominence while playing keyboards with the Mahavishnu Orchestra during the early 1970s, as well as with his film scores for television and film including &quot;Miami Vice Theme&quot; and &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot;, from the 1980s television program &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. He has continued to work as both a musical performer and producer.

Hammer has collaborated with some of the era&#x27;s most influential jazz and rock musicians such as John McLaughlin, Jeff Beck, Billy Cobham, Al Di Meola, Mick Jagger, Carlos Santana, Stanley Clarke, Tommy Bolin, Neal Schon, Steve Lukather, John Abercrombie and Elvin Jones. He has composed and produced at least 14 original motion picture soundtracks, the music for 90 episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and 20 episodes of the television series &quot;Chancer&quot;.

His compositions have won him two Grammy Awards.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jan Hammer was born in Prague, then capital of Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). His mother was Vlasta Průchová, a well-known Czech singer, and his father was a doctor who worked his way through school playing vibraphone and bass guitar. Hammer began playing the piano at the age of four and his formal instruction started two years later. He aspired to follow his father into medicine until a family friend convinced him to develop his musical talents instead. Hammer formed a jazz trio in high school, performing and recording throughout Eastern Europe at the age of fourteen. Upon entrance to the Prague Academy of Musical Arts, he completed many compulsory classes including harmony, counterpoint, music history, and classical composition.

When the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia on 20 August 1968, Hammer&#x27;s studies at the academy were cut short. Hammer recorded a jazz trio live album at &quot;The Domicile&quot; in Munich on 30 August 1968. This was released as &quot;Malma Maliny&quot; by the German label MPS Records. Hammer decided to move to the United States and resolved to become a citizen after receiving a scholarship at Berklee School of Music in Boston.

Upon completion of his studies, Hammer spent a year touring with Sarah Vaughan, recorded with Elvin Jones and Jeremy Steig, then moved to New York City and joined the original lineup of the Mahavishnu Orchestra with guitarist John McLaughlin, violinist Jerry Goodman, bassist Rick Laird, and drummer Billy Cobham in 1971. A successful jazz fusion band, they performed some 530 shows before their farewell concert on 30 December 1973. Hammer was an early pioneer of playing the Minimoog Moog synthesizer in a live setting.

Hammer joined Billy Cobham, Leland Sklar, Tommy Bolin and additional personnel on Billy Cobham&#x27;s debut solo album, Spectrum released in 1973. After recording albums with Goodman and John Abercrombie (ECM session &quot;Timeless&quot; with Jack DeJohnette) in 1974, Hammer&#x27;s solo career began with the release of &quot;The First Seven Days&quot; (1975). He produced and recorded the album at Red Gate Studio, which he&#x27;d built in his upstate New York farmhouse and which has been the location of his recordings ever since.

In 1976, he featured with jazz/rock guitarist Jeff Beck on Beck&#x27;s RIAA platinum album &quot;Wired&quot;, produced by George Martin. A tour featuring songs from &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Blow By Blow&quot; ensued resulting in the &quot;Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group Live&quot; album, a chronicle of their 117-show tour which was certified gold.

The Jan Hammer Group was also formed in 1976 and supported &quot;The First Seven Days&quot; on tour, receiving good reviews from both jazz and rock critics. The group turned out two LPs &quot;Oh, Yeah?&quot; and &quot;Melodies&quot;.

Hammer composed music for the Czech cinematic fairy-tale &quot;The Incredibly Sad Princess&quot;.

===Late 1970s and early 1980s===
In 1977, Hammer recorded &quot;Elegant Gypsy&quot; with Al Di Meola. &quot;Casino&quot;, &quot;Splendido Hotel&quot; and &quot;Electric Rendezvous&quot; followed. He then joined Di Meola for a tour chronicled the same year on &quot;Tour De Force - Live&quot;; and finally appeared throughout &quot;Scenario&quot;, using a Fairlight CMI digital synthesizer and contributing to more than half of the album&#x27;s compositions.

During the mid 70s to early 80s he also recorded and played with Joni Mitchell, Billy Cobham, Santana, Tommy Bolin, Harvey Mason and Stanley Clarke.

Hammer also returned to solo work with the release of &quot;Black Sheep&quot; in 1978. He then formed a new band, known as &quot;Hammer&quot;. Also in 1978, he wrote and performed on three songs for Jeff Beck&#x27;s next album, &quot;There and Back&quot;, which was released in 1980. One of the album tracks, &quot;Star Cycle,&quot; went on to become the theme for the British television series &quot;The Tube&quot;.

He formed Schon &amp; Hammer, a duo with ex Santana and Journey guitarist Neal Schon, that recorded &quot;Untold Passion&quot; in 1981 and &quot;Here to Stay&quot; in 1982.

Hammer took the stage with Jeff Beck in December 1983 for the nine U.S. benefit concerts that raised money for Ronnie Lane&#x27;s A.R.M.S. (Action Research into Multiple Sclerosis), featuring Jimmy Page, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker and a host of others. Into 1984, his various talents were employed on recordings as diverse as James Young&#x27;s (Styx) first solo album, &quot;City Slicker&quot;, for which he co-wrote and produced; John Abercrombie&#x27;s &quot;Night&quot;; Mick Jagger&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;She&#x27;s the Boss&quot;; and Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Flash&quot; which included Hammer&#x27;s song &quot;Escape&quot;, winner of the 1985 Grammy award for &quot;Best Rock Instrumental Performance&quot;.

===&quot;Miami Vice&quot; and successes===
Hammer&#x27;s original scores for three major motion pictures complement a long list of credits for documentaries, television movies in the U.S., commercials, and station identifications. But his greatest challenge came in the fall of 1984, when the producers of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; enlisted him to commence the rigorous weekly schedule of scoring the series.

The popular success of his music on the series was evident after just one season when, on 2 November 1985, the &quot;Miami Vice Soundtrack&quot; hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop album charts. The album achieved quadruple-platinum status with U.S. sales of more than four million copies.

At the Grammy awards in February 1986, &quot;Miami Vice Theme&quot; earned Hammer two awards; one for &quot;Best Pop Instrumental Performance&quot; and one for &quot;Best Instrumental Composition&quot;. He also earned Emmy award nominations in 1985 and 1986, for &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Musical Composition&quot;. At the end of 1986, Hammer won &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot; poll as &quot;Best Studio Synthesist&quot; for a second consecutive year. He had previously won the &quot;Best Lead Synthesist&quot; honor for seven years, at which time he was inducted into the Keyboard Hall of Fame.

In 1988, Hammer bowed out of full-time musical chores for &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; The theme song he composed remained in use until the show ended its five-season run in 1989.

The first project to spring from the new Red Gate was Hammer&#x27;s original soundtrack for &quot;Clinton and Nadine&quot; for HBO Films.

Hammer&#x27;s next two assignments contributed greatly to his next album. First, at the end of the summer, he was commissioned to compose and perform a theme entitled &quot;The Runner&quot; for a major series of television advertisements in England that starred Bob Geldof. Second, Hammer composed and performed the theme music for the top-rated new bi-weekly pan-European television series, &quot;Eurocops&quot;, which premiered in seven countries that November.

&quot;Snapshots&quot; was the first full album from the new Red Gate studio in 1989, with Hammer composing, performing and producing every track. The promo video for &quot;Too Much to Lose,&quot; the album&#x27;s first European single, featured Jeff Beck, David Gilmour of Pink Floyd, and Ringo Starr.

===The 1990s===
In the early 1990s, Hammer toured with drummer Tony Williams. Notably, they featured as Jan Hammer / Tony Williams Group on July 4, 1991, at Spectrum de Montréal (Montreal International Jazz Festival). The show was documented on both DVD and audio CD.

The 1990s saw a renewed focus on scoring, starting with &quot;I Come in Peace&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Dark Angel&quot;, composed in 1989 but released in 1990), &quot;Curiosity Kills&quot; and all twenty episodes of the British television series, &quot;Chancer&quot;, several episodes of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;; a television spot for Amnesty International, featuring Czech president Václav Havel, two pilots for NBC, &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; and &quot;News at 12&quot;, &quot;The Taking of Beverly Hills&quot; (Columbia Pictures) and New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Heat&quot;.

&quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot; was re-released with Hammer&#x27;s theme tune for &quot;Chancer&quot; in the UK in 1991, after the former featured in a series of commercials for NatWest.

Hammer&#x27;s next project was as composer and performer of the original score for the Miramar Productions video album, &quot;Beyond the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

In late 1993 (and through 2000) Hammer was commissioned to compose all the original music for TV Nova, the first commercial television network in Eastern Europe, based in his native Czech Republic, which had its launch on February 4, 1994. He composed everything—including themes for 23 original shows produced by the network, 50 separate station ID&#x27;s, the music for all of the network&#x27;s special broadcasts, plus the music for all the news, sports and weather programs.

1994 saw Hammer recording &quot;Drive&quot;, his first full-fledged album of original new non-soundtrack material under his name in several years. He was reunited with longtime partner Jeff Beck on &quot;Underground&quot;, reminiscent of their collaborations of the past.

In 1995, Hammer returned to his scoring and soundtrack work. He began with the one-hour Universal drama &quot;Vanishing Son&quot;, then went on to compose the theme and score for 13 episodes of the series. He composed and performed the original music for two feature films, both released in 1996: &quot;A Modern Affair&quot; and &quot;In the Kingdom of the Blind the Man with One Eye Is King&quot;. Hammer wrapped up the year scoring &quot;Beastmaster III: The Eye of Braxus&quot;.

In 1996, Hammer&#x27;s scoring assignments included the NBC Movie of the Week, &quot;The Babysitter&#x27;s Seduction&quot;, &quot;The Secret Agent Club&quot;, and &quot;The Corporate Ladder&quot;.

In 1997, Hammer also composed the hard-driving rock soundtrack for the new CD-ROM game, &quot;Outlaw Racers&quot; (MegaMedia). His next project was the theme and original music score for the pilot and the series of &quot;Prince Street&quot;.

Hammer started off 1999 by writing, performing and producing a tune, &quot;Even Odds&quot; for Jeff Beck&#x27;s latest album &quot;Who Else!&quot; (Epic). Also, 1999 saw the release of &quot;The Lost Trident Sessions&quot;, the third (and last) studio album from his former group, the Mahavishnu Orchestra. The album was recorded in 1973 just prior to the band&#x27;s breakup.

=== 2000 to present ===
Hammer produced the original score for &quot;Cocaine Cowboys&quot;, a 2006 documentary depicting the infamous Miami drug trade scene of the 1980s. Hammer&#x27;s soundtrack of the film was released in 2007.

Also in the autumn of 2004 Hammer released the album &quot;The Best of Miami Vice&quot; on the Reality label in the U.S. &quot;The Best of Miami Vice&quot; contains newly recorded versions of &quot;Miami Vice Theme&quot; and &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot;, as well as one bonus track never before released on CD.

In February 2005, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; on three double-sided DVDs. One of the package&#x27;s discs contained bonus material, including an extensive interview and archival footage of Hammer creating music for the show back in 1985.

To coincide with the release of the DVD, Reality Records released a newly recorded version of &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot; to AC (Adult Contemporary) radio in America.

In 2006 Hammer was asked to collaborate with the singer/rapper TQ for a brand new version of his song &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot;. The result of their work was &quot;The Jan Hammer Project Featuring TQ (Terrance Quaites): Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot;. A CD single of this new version climbed up the charts in Europe, hitting No. 1 on the iTunes Europe download list.

In a 2012 interview, Hammer indicated that he is working on a compilation of unreleased works.

In a 2014 interview with the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; he claimed he always felt halfway between experimental music and prog-rock. He also claimed to have recorded the theme song for &quot;Miami Vice&quot; before the series was made, and that it had been the piece he presented to Michael Mann when announcing his interest of being involved with the series. He stated that he used a Fairlight CMI to compose the music to the series while sampling drums and percussion into it with real acoustic sound. He added that he would have been interested in scoring the 2006 film version of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, but that he was never approached by Michael Mann about it.

He recorded a version of the &quot;Squidbillies&quot; theme in 2014.

On 20 July 2018 he released his first album of new material in over 10 years: &quot;Seasons - Part 1&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hammer became a US citizen in 1978. He has a son, Paul, who fronts the band Savoir Adore.

<text>Kraft Foods Group, Inc. was an American food manufacturing and processing conglomerate, split from Kraft Foods Inc. on October 1, 2012, and was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. It became part of Kraft Heinz on July 2, 2015 after merging with Heinz. The merger was arranged by Heinz owners Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, was completed on July 2, 2015, forming Kraft Heinz, the fifth-largest food and beverage company in the world.

==History==

===Spinoff of Kraft Foods Group from Kraft Foods Inc.===
In August 2011, Kraft Foods Inc. announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies — a snack food company and a grocery company. On April 2, 2012, Kraft Foods Inc. announced that it had filed a Form 10 Registration Statement to the SEC to split the company into two companies to serve the &quot;North American grocery business&quot;.

On October 1, 2012, Kraft Foods Inc. spun off its North American grocery business to a new company called &quot;Kraft Foods Group&quot;, Inc. The remainder of Kraft Foods Inc. was renamed Mondelēz International, Inc., and was refocused as an international snack and confection company. Burt P. Flickinger III of Strategic Resource Group said the strategy &quot;worked for Mondelez, but not for Kraft.&quot;

On November 19, 2013, an arbitration ruling ordered Starbucks to pay Kraft Foods Inc. $2.7 billion because of an early contract termination. The money would go to Mondelēz International, Inc. 

In October 2013, Kraft announced that it would remove artificial dyes from three macaroni and cheese varieties made in kid-friendly shapes, but not its plain elbow-shaped Kraft Macaroni and Cheese product with &quot;original flavor&quot;. This was in response to a petition by activist Vani Hari and blogger Lisa Leake who delivered a petition to the company to remove controversial synthetic dyes Yellow 5 (labeled as Tartrazine) and Yellow 6 from its signature macaroni and cheese products.

===Kraft and Heinz merger===
On March 25, 2015, Kraft Foods Group Inc. announced that it would merge with the H.J. Heinz Company, owned by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Kraft&#x27;s shares rose about 17 percent in premarket trading after the announcement of the deal, which will bring Heinz back to the public market following its takeover over two years prior. The companies completed the merger on July 2, 2015.

==Sponsorships and promotions==
Kraft is an official partner and sponsor of both Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League. Since 2006, Kraft Foods has sponsored &quot;Kraft Hockeyville&quot;, a reality television series produced by CBC/SRC Sports, in which communities demonstrate their commitment to the sport of ice hockey in a contest revolving around the theme of community spirit. The winning community gets a cash prize dedicated to upgrading their hometown arena, as well as the opportunity to host an NHL preseason game. In 2007, it was then relegated to segments aired during &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Kraft Hockeyville&quot; was expanded to the United States with a separate competition for communities there.

From 2002 to 2014, Kraft sponsored the Kraft Nabisco Championship, one of the four &quot;majors&quot; on the LPGA tour. The company also sponsored the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, a post-season college football bowl game, from 2010 to 2012.

==Brands==

The company&#x27;s core businesses are in beverage, cheese, dairy foods, snack foods, and convenience foods. Kraft&#x27;s major brands include:

<text>George Clayton Huff, Jr. (born November 4, 1980) is an American singer. He placed first among male contestants and overall fifth-place finalist on the third season of the reality/talent-search television series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

==Biography==
Huff is originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. Huff auditioned for the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in Houston, Texas; he was a member of the fourth group of semi-finalists. He was actually not among those originally chosen for the semi-final round, but was put through when contestant Donnie Williams was disqualified for a drunk driving arrest.

==American Idol==
Huff was not voted through to the final round from his group of semi-finalists, but got another second chance when he was brought back for the wildcard round and put through as a finalist by contest judge Simon Cowell. During this period, New Orleans Fox Affiliate WVUE would hold specials including Huff&#x27;s family cheering George on during the latest episodes.

On May 5, 2004, Huff was voted off in fifth place after two renditions of Fred Astaire&#x27;s &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; and Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; during big band week.

===American Idol performances===
==After Idol==
His album, &quot;Miracles&quot;, was released by Word Records, on October 11, 2005. The first single off that album was &quot;Brighter Day&quot;. It sold 18,000 copies.

In 2005, his Louisiana home was affected by Hurricane Katrina. He left New Orleans and stayed at his brother&#x27;s house in Dallas. His recent performances have included an October 2006 concert at West Virginia University and a December 2006 Christmas show in Salinas, California. He also had a recent brief performance at New York&#x27;s Dr. Susan S. Mckinney Secondary School for the Arts on November 10, 2008.

In 2007 Huff&#x27;s song &quot;Brighter Day&quot; was briefly featured in Tyler Perry&#x27;s movie &quot;Why Did I Get Married?&quot; starring Janet Jackson.

On April 7, 2009 George Huff released his self-titled sophomore effort, featuring the songs &quot;I Belong To You(Yours)&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot; (featuring Coko of SWV and Tasha Collins from the first season of BET&#x27;s Sunday Best) and the lead single &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Go&quot;.

On March 24, 2011, Huff performed as a back-up singer to longtime friend and fellow &quot;Idol&quot; alum Jennifer Hudson during the third week of finals on the tenth season of American Idol, where she performed her current album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Where You At.&quot; Huff has been singing background vocals for many of Hudson&#x27;s live performances since then, and works as her vocal arranger for live performances.

<doc id="518737" wikidata="Q696083" url="?curid=518737" title="Crusader tank">
<text>Crusader, in full &quot;Tank, Cruiser Mk VI, Crusader&quot;, also known by its General Staff number A.15, was one of the primary British cruiser tanks during the early part of the Second World War. Over 5,000 tanks were manufactured and they made important contributions to the British victories during the North African campaign. The Crusader only saw active service in Africa but the chassis of the tank was modified to create anti-aircraft, fire support, observation, communication, bulldozer and recovery vehicle variants.

The first Crusader Mark I tanks entered service in 1941 and though manoeuvrable, they were relatively lightly armoured and under-armed. The following Crusader Mark II had a maximum armour of . The main armament for the Crusader Mark I and IIs was a 40 mm Ordnance QF 2-pounder gun; the following Crusader Mark III was fitted with a 57 mm Ordnance QF 6-pounder gun at the expense of one member of the crew in the turret. This variant was more than a match for the mid-generation German Panzer III and Panzer IV medium tanks that it faced in combat. As part of the 1st Armoured Brigade, the Crusader was to prove vital during the Second Battle of El Alamein, at the siege of Tobruk and in the Tunisia campaign.

Retained in service because of delays with its replacement, by late 1942, the lack of armament upgrades, plus reliability problems due to the harsh desert conditions and the appearance of uparmoured and upgunned German tanks in the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot;, saw the Crusader replaced as the main tank by US-supplied M3 Grant and then by the M4 Sherman medium tanks but it was retained in combat use until the end of the war in North Africa and after that for training in Britain.

==Design and development==
In 1938, Nuffield Mechanizations and Aero Limited produced their A16 design for a heavy cruiser tank based on Christie suspension. Looking for a lighter and cheaper tank to build, the General Staff requested alternatives from British industry. To this end, the A13 Mk III cruiser tank, which was to enter service as the &quot;Tank, Cruiser Mk V&quot; (known as the Covenanter), was designed by London Midland and Scottish. Nuffield was, in 1939, offered the opportunity to take part in the production of the Covenanter.

Nuffield, however, preferred to work on its own version of the A13—though it still provided design work for the Covenanter&#x27;s turret. This new tank was adopted as &quot;Tank, Cruiser, Mk VI Crusader&quot;, under General Staff specification A15. Although Crusader is often referred to as an improved version of the Covenanter, in fact it was a parallel design. Both tanks were ordered &quot;off the drawing board&quot; without building prototypes first. Despite a later start, the pilot model of the Crusader was ready six weeks before the first Covenanter.

Unlike earlier &quot;Christie cruisers&quot; (the A13 Mark III and Mark IV tanks and the Mark V Covenanter) that were built with four road wheels, Crusader had five road wheels each side to improve weight distribution in a tank that weighed almost 20 tons instead of the 14 tons of the previous cruisers. The -diameter wheels were of pressed steel with solid rubber tyres. The hull sides were built up of two separated plates, with the suspension arms between them.

It had a different engine from the Covenanter, different steering system and a conventional cooling system with radiators in the engine compartment. Covenanter used a brand new engine design, whereas Crusader adapted the readily available Liberty engine to fit into a lower profile engine compartment. At the left side of the front hull—a place occupied by the engine radiator in the Covenanter—was mounted a small hand-traversed auxiliary turret armed with a Besa machine gun. The auxiliary turret was awkward to use and was often removed in the field or remained unoccupied.

Both the A13 Mk III Covenanter and the A15 Crusader designs used the same main turret. The turret was polygonal—with sides that sloped out then in again—to give maximum space on the limited turret ring diameter. Early production vehicles had a &quot;semi-internal&quot; cast gun mantlet, which was quickly replaced in production by a better protected larger cast mantlet with three vertical slits for the main gun, a coaxial Besa machine gun, and the sighting telescope. There was no cupola for the commander, who instead had a flat hatch with the periscope mounted through it.

The main armament, as in other British tanks of the period, was balanced so that the gunner could control its elevation through a padded shaft against his right shoulder rather than using a geared mechanism. This fitted well with the British doctrine of firing accurately on the move.

When it was understood that there would be delays in the introduction of successor heavy cruiser tanks (the Cavalier, Centaur and Cromwell), the Crusader was adapted with a six-pounder gun.

==Performance==
Initial performance of the Crusader was found to be better than the comparable Stuart light tanks. Despite reliability problems, the tanks formed the primary unit for British cruiser tank armoured regiments, while the Stuart was used for reconnaissance.

The Crusader suffered from chronic reliability problems in desert use as a result of several factors. Tanks arriving in North Africa were missing many of the essential tools and servicing manuals needed to maintain operation—stolen or lost in transit. As tanks broke down, a lack of spare parts meant that many components were replaced with worn parts recovered from other tanks. When the tanks were returned to the base workshops upon reaching service intervals, many were serviced with components that had already achieved their design lifespan.

A rapid ramp-up in manufacturing within the UK caused quality issues as inexperienced workers began assembling tanks. This placed further pressure on the receiving base workshops who had to carry out the necessary re-work.

The new tanks also had a number of design flaws which needed to be worked out. The reconfiguration of the Mk. III Liberty engine into a flatter format to fit into the Crusader engine compartment had badly affected the tank&#x27;s water pumps and cooling fan arrangements, both of which were critical in the hot desert temperatures. Several official and unofficial in-theatre modifications were applied in attempts to improve reliability and conserve water, which otherwise had to be prioritised on keeping the vehicles running. Rectification of these issues took a very long time, by which time confidence in the Crusader had been lost. Calls were made at various points for the vehicles to be replaced with the Valentine infantry tank or US-made M3 Grant tank.

As time moved on, more and more were being returned to base workshops, leading to a shortage of battle-ready tanks and a massive backlog of repair works to be completed. The number of vehicles available on the frontline dwindled, and US-made replacements were brought in.

While the 2-pounder gun had good performance when the tank was introduced, ammunition supply was focused on solid armour-piercing (AP) rounds. When German tanks moved to face-hardened armour, an effective Armour-piercing, Capped, Ballistic Capped (APCBC) ammunition was not available. By the time it was, German tanks had adapted specifically to counter it. Delays in producing the next generation of cruiser tanks meant the Crusader was later up-armed with the 6-pounder, which had much better anti-tank performance.

In keeping with a highly mobile cruiser tank, the vehicle had lighter armour than the Axis tanks that it encountered. It was among the first to have additional armour fitted to the ammunition storage. This greatly improved vehicle survivability with only a slight reduction in the number of rounds that could be carried. A significant area of concern, however, was the driver&#x27;s compartment, the side of which had been left exposed by the removal of the secondary Besa machine gun turret. The angle left behind became a shot trap, with some incoming shells being deflected into the tank.

Despite the many problems, the Crusader was successful in combat against Axis tanks, using its better mobility and greater capability to fire on the move to strike at vehicle weak spots. This caused a change in German tactics, whereby Axis tanks would feign retreat, drawing Crusader units onto a pre-positioned anti-tank gun screen. With no high explosive (HE) ammunition, the Crusader struggled to engage these emplaced enemies. This situation continued until the introduction of US-produced vehicles, such as the Grant and then the Sherman, with dual-purpose 75 mm guns.

==Service history==
===North Africa===
With the Axis forces in North Africa having pushed the British back to the Egyptian border and the remaining British armour being a mixed force of older tanks with a few Matilda infantry tanks, tanks were hurriedly shipped via the Mediterranean arriving on 12 May 1941. There were sufficient Crusaders to equip the 6th Royal Tank Regiment (6RTR) which with the older cruiser tanks of 2nd Royal Tank Regiment (2RTR) formed the 7th Armoured Brigade. The rest of the tanks were Matilda infantry tanks for the 4th Armoured Brigade giving the 7th Armoured Division only four tank regiments.
Although there was pressure from London for the 7th Armoured Division to go into action, outfitting for the desert and training delayed the first use of Crusaders until Operation Battleaxe, an attempt to relieve the siege of Tobruk in June. As the brigade swept round the flank, the Crusaders were caught by concealed anti-tank guns and lost 11 tanks. The 6 RTR lost further tanks to action and defects in the fighting withdrawal during the next two days.

The 7th Armoured Brigade was re-equipped with further Crusaders, but, as the brigade had been expanded by the addition of 7th Hussars, there were not sufficient Crusaders to replace the older cruiser tanks.

The 22nd Armoured Brigade comprising three inexperienced armoured regiments equipped with Crusaders, transferred to North Africa to bring the 7th Armoured up to a strength of three armoured brigades. The 8th Hussars was added to the 4th Armoured Brigade, but these had to be equipped with M3 Stuart light tanks as there were still insufficient cruisers. The 22nd was able to take part in Operation Crusader in November 1941.

In Operation Crusader, the two British corps were disposed such that they could not support each other, but it was expected that, as the British outnumbered the German and Italian forces in tanks, the tank against tank battles would be decided in their favour. However, in the resulting encounters, Rommel did not put his tanks &quot;en masse&quot; into action against the British ones, and the large numbers of German anti-tank (AT) guns working offensively with the tanks and infantry proved effective. The Germans were mostly equipped with the PaK 38, a long-barrelled 50 mm gun with a range of . This superiority in quality and tactical deployment of anti-tank guns was to be a feature of the Afrika Korps throughout the &quot;Desert War&quot;. The Crusader&#x27;s 2-pounder (40 mm) gun was as effective as the short-barrelled 50 mm of the Panzer III, although it was out-ranged by the short-barrelled 75 mm of the Panzer IV.

Although the Crusader was faster than any tanks it opposed, its potential was limited by a relatively light QF 2-pounder gun, thin armour, and mechanical problems. A particular tactical limitation was the lack of a high-explosive shell for the main armament (these existed but were never supplied). Axis tank forces developed an extremely effective method of dealing with attacking tank forces by retiring behind a screen of concealed anti-tank guns. The pursuing tanks could then be engaged by the artillery. With the German anti-tank guns out of range of the tanks&#x27; machine guns and without a high-explosive shell to return fire, the tanks were left with the equally unpalatable options of withdrawing under fire or trying to overrun the gun screen.
The Crusader proved prone to &quot;brew up&quot; when hit, a problem that was identified as being due to the ammunition being ignited by hot metal penetrating the unprotected racks. The angled underside of the turret created shot traps that deflected rounds downward, through the hull roof.

The Crusader proved unreliable in the desert. This started with their transport from the UK to North Africa. Poor preparation and handling caused problems that had to be rectified before they could be passed to the regiments and ate into the supply of spare parts. Once in use, the sand caused erosion in the cooling system and the stresses of hard cross-country travel caused oil leaks between the engine block and the cylinders. Since there were few tank transporters or railways in the desert, the tanks had to travel long distances on their tracks, causing further wear.

By the end of 1941, there was only one brigade, the 2nd, which was operating with only Crusaders. In March 1942, US-built Grant medium tanks arrived and replaced one in three Crusader squadrons. While the Grant with its effective 75 mm gun gave better firepower against anti-tank guns and infantry, had better armour, and was more mechanically reliable, it was slower, limiting the Crusaders when they had to operate together. From May 1942, Mk IIIs (with the 57 mm 6-pounder gun) were delivered. Of the 840 tanks available to the British, 260 were Crusaders. The German tanks they were facing were improved types with face-hardened frontal armour, which caused 2-pounder shot to shatter rather than penetrate.
As part of British deception operations, Crusaders could be issued with &quot;Sunshade&quot;, which was a metal framework with canvas covering that disguised the tank as a lorry to German aerial reconnaissance. Dummy tanks were also deployed.
Later in the campaign, shipping was improved, Nuffield put an engineering team in Egypt, and crews were better at preventing problems but the reputation of the Crusader could not recover.

After Montgomery took over command, the imbalance between British and German armour was redressed by better control and the addition of more American-supplied Grant and Sherman tanks. The Crusader was replaced in the main line of battle and used for &quot;light squadrons&quot; trying to flank the enemy when it engaged the heavier units. The 9th Australian Infantry Division operated Crusaders for reconnaissance and liaison.

The First Army landed as part of the Tunisia campaign; some of its units were using the Crusader and these saw action from 24 November. These were not solely Crusader regiments, but mixed Crusader and Valentine tanks; within each squadron, two troops were Crusader IIIs, and there were Crusader II CSs attached to the Squadron HQ. These units of the 26th Armoured Brigade were used as an independent armoured column, &quot;Blade Force&quot;, with the 78th Infantry Division. The operations of Blade Force were on terrain different from the desert of the earlier campaigns, and the fighting took place with smaller numbers of vehicles. These actions were similar to what would be seen later in Europe. The 1st Army converted to Shermans during the Tunisia campaign, but Crusaders remained in use with the Eighth Army for longer. The last major actions for Crusaders were the Battle of the Mareth Line and the Battle of Wadi Akarit. The North Africa campaign finished shortly afterwards.

===Other use===

After the completion of the North African Campaign, the availability of better tanks, such as the Sherman and Cromwell, relegated the Crusader to secondary duties, such as anti-aircraft mounts or gun tractors. In these roles, it served for the remainder of the war. The Crusader, along with the Covenanter, equipped regiments at home; particularly those of the 11th Armoured Division. A Crusader bulldozer was developed, but not used operationally. One of these bulldozer tanks was converted for removing munitions following a fire at Royal Ordnance Factory Kirkby. 

The Crusader anti-aircraft guns were designed for use in North West Europe but given Allied air supremacy, the AA troops were disbanded. An AA Crusader wireless operator/gun loader recounted arriving in Normandy in Crusaders in Mid July 1944, but were switched to Cromwell fairly quickly, 

The Crusader gun tractors operated with 76.2 mm Ordnance QF 17-pounder 17-pounder anti-tank gun regiments attached to armoured divisions and with XII Corps. One Crusader was used for testing the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, the increased horsepower over the standard Liberty engine giving a maximum speed in excess of . The turret of a Crusader tank was used by the French Far East Expeditionary Corps to defend the city of Hanoi at the beginning of the first Indochina War.

==Variants==
===Crusader I (Cruiser Mk VI)===

Original production version. The auxiliary turret was often removed in the field, eliminating the hull machine gunner position.
* Crusader I CS (Cruiser Mk VI CS) (&#x27;Close Support&#x27;) mounted a Ordnance QF 3 inch howitzer (76.2 mm) in the turret instead of the 2-pounder.

===Crusader II (Cruiser Mk VIA)===
The Crusader II had increased armour on hull front and turret front. As with the Mk I, the auxiliary turret was often removed.
* Crusader II CS (Cruiser Mk VIA CS) mounted a 3-inch (76.2 mm) howitzer in the turret.
* Command tank version existed with dummy gun and two No. 19 radios.

===Crusader III===

Due to delays with the Cruiser Mark VII Cavalier and the need for cruiser tanks, the Crusader was up-gunned with the 57 mm 6-pounder, the first British tank to mount this gun. Design work for a new turret started in March 1941, but Nuffield was not involved until late in the year, when they adapted the existing turret with a new mantlet and hatch.

The turret also received an extractor fan to clear fumes from the firing of the gun. The larger gun restricted turret space, so the crew was reduced to three, with the commander also acting as gun loader, a role previously performed by the wireless operator. The auxiliary turret space was given over to ammunition stowage.

Crusader III also saw the introduction of the Mk. IV Liberty engine, fixing many of the reliability issues previously encountered. This featured the Mk. III engine&#x27;s later updated water pumps along with a shaft drive replacing chain drive for the cooling fans.

Production started in May 1942 and 144 were complete by July. The Crusader III first saw action, with about 100 participating, at the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942.

;Observation post
This was a tank converted to a mobile armoured observation post for direction of artillery. The turret was fixed in place, the gun was removed and a dummy barrel fitted to give it the same outward appearance of a regular tank. With no requirement for ammunition, the interior was given over to the radios, two No. 19 radios and No. 18 radio, map boards and related equipment. The Royal Artillery could then operate the OP tank up front among the fighting units directing artillery fire in their support.

===Crusader III, AA Mk I===
The 6-pounder was replaced with a Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun with an autoloader and powered mounting in an open-topped turret. The crew numbered four: gun commander, gun layer, loader, and driver. However, those Crusader III, AA Mk I used in NW Europe from D-day on did not have the turret, but a 40 mm Bofors gun mounted directly on the hull top with its standard shield.

===Crusader III, AA Mk II / Mk III===
A Crusader armed with twin Oerlikon 20 mm guns for anti-aircraft use and a single .303 (7.7 mm) Vickers GO machine gun. The turret was a small polygonal turret with heavy armour, but poor situational visibility for spotting approaching aircraft. The Mk III only differed from the Mk II by the position of the radio, which was moved to the hull in order to free some space inside the turret.

A variation with triple Oerlikons was produced in very limited quantities but seem to have been used only for training.

Due to Allied air superiority over the battlefields of north-west Europe, none of the AA versions saw much action against aircraft but a few - especially with the 1st Polish Armoured Division - were used against ground targets. The AA troops - attached to HQ squadrons - were disbanded after the Normandy landings.

===Crusader II, Gun Tractor Mk I===

The Crusader gun tractor came out of a need for a vehicle to tow the heavy 76.2 mm QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun. It was a Crusader tank hull with a simple boxy superstructure replacing that of the gun tank. The 14 mm thick structure protected the driver and the gun crew of six. The tractor also carried ammunition on the rear and within the crew area.

Although nearly as heavy as the gun tank, it was still capable of high speed and was officially limited to . This was still hard on the towed 17 pounder guns. They were used in northwest Europe from the Normandy landings of 1944 to the end of the war in 1945.

One such unit was 86 Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, part of XII Corps. In 86, the Crusader gun tractor replaced earlier Morris C8 gun tractors in two out of the four batteries. Unit veterans reported that the Crusader was popular with the crews and were often driven by former Armoured Corps drivers seconded to the Royal Artillery because of their driving experience. Some veterans of regiment 86 claimed they removed the &#x27;governors&#x27; that normally limited tank speeds and credited an empty Crusader with speeds up to . They also claimed to be able to outrun Military Police motorcycles, which were limited to a wartime speed of due to low grade petrol.

Some vehicles were also used by battery commanders as armoured command and reconnaissance vehicles.

===Crusader ARV Mk I===
Armoured recovery vehicle based on turretless Crusader hull. One prototype was built in 1942.

===Crusader self-propelled guns===
* A post-war modification was built, probably for testing purposes only, with a 5.5-inch (140 mm) Medium Gun installed at the front of the vehicle, facing back.
* Some Crusader gun tractors sold after the war to Argentina were converted to self-propelled guns, with French 75 mm or 105 mm gun installed in a large, boxy superstructure.

===Additional variants===
* Crusader with Anti-Mine Roller Attachment (AMRA) Mk Id: a mine clearing device consisting of four heavy rollers suspended from a frame. Weight of the rollers could be increased by filling them with water, sand etc.

Crusaders were used for experimentation such as a flotation kit, consisting of two pontoons attached to hull sides, special blades attached to tracks to propel the vehicle in water and a cowl over engine air intakes and cooling louvres.

==Operators==
* – converted gun tractors
** one squadron of the 9th Division Cavalry Regiment; North Africa (1941–43)
** at least one Crusader was trialled in Australia (1941) by the 1st Armoured Division
* - 2 Battalions - around 60 Tanks of the Egyptian Army Cavalry and Armoured Corps used it till the early 1960s. Along with 1 Battalion of Crusader AA as Anti-Aircraft Artillery from 1944 till the late 1960s. Saw action in the Suez War in Anti-aircraft role.
* – Captured vehicles used in the 15th Panzer Division. Designated &quot;Kreuzer Panzerkampfwagen Mk VI 746 (e)&quot;.
* – captured vehicles used in the 133rd Littorio Armoured Division.
* – Used by the 1st Armoured Division
* 

==Surviving vehicles==

Around 21 tanks survive in various degrees of preservation, ranging from running-condition museum vehicles to wrecks. Eight survive in various collections in South Africa.

Examples include the Crusader III in running condition at The Tank Museum in the United Kingdom. The Musée des Blindés in France preserves a Mk III anti-aircraft Crusader and the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands owns a gun-tractor variant.

<text>Soot ( ) is a mass of impure carbon particles resulting from the incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Soot is considered a hazardous substance with carcinogenic properties. Most broadly, the term includes all the particulate matter produced by this process, including black carbon and residual pyrolysed fuel particles such as coal, cenospheres, charred wood, and petroleum coke classified as cokes or char. It can include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals like mercury.

Soot causes various types of cancer and lung disease.

==Terminology==
===Definition===
Among scientists, exact definitions for soot vary, depending partly on their field. For example, atmospheric scientists may use a different definition compared to toxicologists. Soot&#x27;s definition can also vary across time, and from paper to paper even among scientists in the same field. A common feature of the definitions is that soot is composed largely of carbon based particles resulting from the incomplete burning of hydrocarbons or organic fuel such as wood. Some note that soot may be formed by other high temperature processes, not just by burning. Soot typically takes an aerosol form when first created. It tends to eventually settle onto surfaces, though some parts of it may be decomposed while still airborne. In some definitions, soot is defined purely as carbonaceous particles, but in others it is defined to include the whole ensemble of particles resulting from partial combustion of organic matter or fossil fuels - as such it can include non carbon elements like sulphur and even traces of metal. In many definitions, soot is assumed to be black, but in some definitions it can be composed partly or even mainly of brown carbon, and so can also be medium or even light gray in colour.

===Related terms===
Terms like &quot;soot&quot;, &quot;carbon black&quot;, and &quot;black carbon&quot; are often used to mean the same thing, even in the scientific literature, but other scientists have stated this is incorrect and that they refer to chemically and physically distinct things.

Carbon black is a term for the industrial production of powdery carbonaceous matter which has been underway since the 19th century. Carbon black is composed almost entirely of elemental carbon. Carbon black is not found in regular soot - only in the special soot that is intentionally produced for its manufacture, mostly from specialised oil furnaces.

Black carbon is a term that arose in the late twentieth century among atmospheric scientists, to describe strongly light absorbing carbonaceous particles which have a significant climate forcing affect - second only to itself as a contributor to short term global warming. The term is sometimes used synonymously with soot, but is now used preferentially in atmospheric science, though some prefer more precise terms like &#x27;light-absorbing carbon&#x27;. Unlike carbon black, black carbon is produced unintentionally. The chemical composition of &quot;black carbon&quot; is much more varied, and typically has a much lower proportion of elemental carbon, compared with &quot;carbon black&quot;. In some definitions, black carbon also includes charcoal, a type of matter where the chunks tend to be too large to have an aerosol form as is the case with soot.

== Sources ==
Soot as an airborne contaminant in the environment has many different sources, all of which are results of some form of pyrolysis. They include soot from coal burning, internal-combustion engines, power-plant boilers, hog-fuel boilers, ship boilers, central steam-heat boilers, waste incineration, local field burning, house fires, forest fires, fireplaces, and furnaces. These exterior sources also contribute to the indoor environment sources such as smoking of plant matter, cooking, oil lamps, candles, quartz/halogen bulbs with settled dust, fireplaces, exhaust emissions from vehicles, and defective furnaces. Soot in very low concentrations is capable of darkening surfaces or making particle agglomerates, such as those from ventilation systems, appear black. Soot is the primary cause of &quot;ghosting&quot;, the discoloration of walls and ceilings or walls and flooring where they meet. It is generally responsible for the discoloration of the walls above baseboard electric heating units.

The formation and properties of soot depend strongly on the fuel composition, but may also be influenced by flame temperature. Regarding fuel composition, the rank ordering of sooting tendency of fuel components is: naphthalenes → benzenes → aliphatics. However, the order of sooting tendencies of the aliphatics (alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes) varies dramatically depending on the flame type. The difference between the sooting tendencies of aliphatics and aromatics is thought to result mainly from the different routes of formation. Aliphatics appear to first form acetylene and polyacetylenes, which is a slow process; aromatics can form soot both by this route and also by a more direct pathway involving ring condensation or polymerization reactions building on the existing aromatic structure.

== Description ==
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adopted the description of soot particles given in the glossary of Charlson and Heintzenberg (1995), &quot;Particles formed during the quenching of gases at the outer edge of flames of organic vapours, consisting predominantly of carbon, with lesser amounts of oxygen and hydrogen present as carboxyl and phenolic groups and exhibiting an imperfect graphitic structure&quot;.

Formation of soot is a complex process, an evolution of matter in which a number of molecules undergo many chemical and physical reactions within a few milliseconds. Soot always contains nanoparticles of graphite and diamond, a phenomenon known as gemmy soot. Soot is a powder-like form of amorphous carbon. Gas-phase soot contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The PAHs in soot are known mutagens and are classified as a &quot;known human carcinogen&quot; by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Soot forms during incomplete combustion from precursor molecules such as acetylene. It consists of agglomerated nanoparticles with diameters between 6 and 30 nm. The soot particles can be mixed with metal oxides and with minerals and can be coated with sulfuric acid.

==Soot formation mechanism==
Many details of soot formation chemistry remain unanswered and controversial, but there have been a few agreements:
* Soot begins with some precursors or building blocks.
* Nucleation of heavy molecules occurs to form particles.
* Surface growth of a particle proceeds by adsorption of gas phase molecules.
* Coagulation happens via reactive particle–particle collisions.
* Oxidation of the molecules and soot particles reduces soot formation.

==Hazards==

Soot, particularly diesel exhaust pollution, accounts for over one-quarter of the total hazardous pollution in the air.

Among these diesel emission components, particulate matter has been a serious concern for human health due to its direct and broad impact on the respiratory organs. In earlier times, health professionals associated PM10 (diameter &lt; 10 μm) with chronic lung disease, lung cancer, influenza, asthma, and increased mortality rate. However, recent scientific studies suggest that these correlations be more closely linked with fine particles (PM2.5) and ultra-fine particles (PM0.1).

Long-term exposure to urban air pollution containing soot increases the risk of coronary artery disease.

Diesel exhaust (DE) gas is a major contributor to combustion-derived particulate-matter air pollution. In human experimental studies using an exposure chamber setup, DE has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation. This serves as a plausible mechanistic link between the previously described association between particulate matter air pollution and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Soot also tends to form in chimneys in domestic houses possessing one or more fireplaces. If a large deposit collects in one, it can ignite and create a chimney fire. Regular cleaning by a chimney sweep should eliminate the problem.

==Soot modeling==
Soot mechanism is difficult to model mathematically because of the large number of primary components of diesel fuel, complex combustion mechanisms, and the heterogeneous interactions during soot formation. Soot models are broadly categorized into three subgroups: empirical (equations that are adjusted to match experimental soot profiles), semi-empirical (combined mathematical equations and some empirical models which used for particle number density and soot volume and mass fraction), and detailed theoretical mechanisms (covers detailed chemical kinetics and physical models in all phases).

First, empirical models use correlations of experimental data to predict trends in soot production. Empirical models are easy to implement and provide excellent correlations for a given set of operating conditions. However, empirical models cannot be used to investigate the underlying mechanisms of soot production. Therefore, these models are not flexible enough to handle changes in operating conditions. They are only useful for testing previously established designed experiments under specific conditions.

Second, semi-empirical models solve rate equations that are calibrated using experimental data. Semi-empirical models reduce computational costs primarily by simplifying the chemistry in soot formation and oxidation. Semi-empirical models reduce the size of chemical mechanisms and use simpler molecules, such as acetylene as precursors.
Detailed theoretical models use extensive chemical mechanisms containing hundreds of chemical reactions in order to predict concentrations of soot. Detailed theoretical soot models contain all the components present in the soot formation with a high level of detailed chemical and physical processes.

Finally, comprehensive models (detailed models) are usually expensive and slow to compute, as they are much more complex than empirical or semi-empirical models. Thanks to recent technological progress in computation, it has become more feasible to use detailed theoretical models and obtain more realistic results; however, further advancement of comprehensive theoretical models is limited by the accuracy of modeling of formation mechanisms.

Additionally, phenomenological models have found wide use recently. Phenomenological soot models, which may be categorized as semi-empirical models, correlate empirically observed phenomena in a way that is consistent with the fundamental theory, but is not directly derived from the theory. These models use sub-models developed to describe the different processes (or phenomena) observed during the combustion process. Examples of sub-models of phenomenological empirical models include spray model, lift-off model, heat release model, ignition delay model, etc. These sub-models can be empirically developed from observation or by using basic physical and chemical relations. Phenomenological models are accurate for their relative simplicity. They are useful, especially when the accuracy of the model parameters is low. Unlike empirical models, phenomenological models are flexible enough to produce reasonable results when multiple operating conditions change.

==Applications==
Historically soot was used in manufacturing artistic paints and shoe polish, as well as a blackener for Russia leather for boots. With the advent of the printing press it was used in the printing ink well into the 20th century.

<text>The voiceless velar plosive or stop is a type of consonantal sound used in almost all spoken languages. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is codice_1.

The sound is a very common sound cross-linguistically. Most languages have at least a plain , and some distinguish more than one variety. Most Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindi and Bengali, have a two-way contrast between aspirated and plain . Only a few languages lack a voiceless velar plosive, e.g. Tahitian and Mongolian.

Some languages have the voiceless pre-velar plosive, which is articulated slightly more front compared with the place of articulation of the prototypical velar plosive, though not as front as the prototypical palatal plosive.

Conversely, some languages have the voiceless post-velar plosive, which is articulated slightly behind the place of articulation of the prototypical velar plosive, though not as back as the prototypical uvular plosive.

<text>Georg Wittig (; 16 June 1897 – 26 August 1987) was a German chemist who reported a method for synthesis of alkenes from aldehydes and ketones using compounds called phosphonium ylides in the Wittig reaction. He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Herbert C. Brown in 1979.

==Biography==
Wittig was born in Berlin, Germany; shortly after his birth moved with his family to Kassel, where his father was professor at the applied arts high school. He attended school in Kassel and started studying chemistry at the University of Tübingen 1916. He was drafted and became a lieutenant in the cavalry of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel). After being an Allied prisoner of war from 1918 until 1919, Wittig found it hard to restart his chemistry studies owing to overcrowding at the universities. By a direct plea to Karl von Auwers, who was professor for organic chemistry at the University of Marburg at the time, he was able to resume university study and after three years was awarded the Ph.D. in organic chemistry.

Karl von Auwers was able to convince him to start an academic career, leading to his habilitation in 1926. He became a close friend of Karl Ziegler, who was also doing his habilitation with Auwers during that time. The successor of Karl von Auwers, Hans Meerwein, accepted Wittig as lecturer, partly because he was impressed by the new 400-page book on stereochemistry that Wittig had written. In 1931 Wittig married Waltraud Ernst, a colleague from the Auwers working group. The invitation of Karl Fries brought him as professor to the TU Braunschweig in 1932. The time in Braunschweig became more and more problematic as the Nazis tried to get rid of Karl Fries and Wittig showed solidarity with him. After the forced retirement of Fries, in 1937 Hermann Staudinger offered Wittig a position at the University of Freiburg, partly because he knew Wittig from his book on stereochemistry in which he supported Staudinger&#x27;s highly criticized theory of macromolecules. The foundations of carbanion chemistry were laid during Wittig&#x27;s time in Freiburg.

In 1944 he succeeded the head of the organic chemistry department Wilhelm Schlenk at the University of Tübingen. Most of his scientific work, including the development of the Wittig reaction, was performed during this time in Tübingen. The 1956 appointment of the nearly sixty-year-old Wittig as head of the organic chemistry department at the University of Heidelberg as successor of Karl Freudenberg was exceptional even at that time. The newly built department and the close connection to the BASF convinced Wittig to take this opportunity. He worked at the University of Heidelberg even after his retirement in 1967 and published papers until 1980. Most of his awards were presented during this time at Heidelberg, such as the honorary doctorate of the Sorbonne in 1956 and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1979.

==Work==
Wittig&#x27;s contributions also include the preparation of phenyllithium and the discovery of the 1,2-Wittig rearrangement and the 2,3-Wittig rearrangement.

Wittig was well known in the chemistry community for being a consummate experimenter and observer of chemical transformations, while caring very little for the theoretical and mechanistic underpinnings of the work he produced.

Georg also has his name on a literature work titled on a compound labelled Colopidalol.

Lewis lived in various cities across the United States before leaving home at the age of 18. He graduated from Central High School in Cheyenne, Wyoming in 1998. He starred in the lead role of Thorin Oakenshield in a local children theater&#x27;s production of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; in the summer of 1997. Lewis performed in other numerous theatrical productions and was a band member of various rock and roll bands throughout his high school and college years. Lewis is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and attended Brigham Young University–Idaho for a time hoping to pursue a career in medicine.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
At the age of 23, Lewis cashed in his college loans to audition for the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he sang &#x27;&quot;Crazy Love&quot; by Van Morrison. Praised by Simon Cowell for his &quot;very, very good voice,&quot; Lewis went on to display an uninhibited stage personality that won the hearts of millions of Idol fans. Simon Cowell later hailed Jon as &quot;the dark horse to win the competition,&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine pegged Jon as a &quot;pick to win,&quot; while Elton John praised Lewis&#x27;s voice for his &quot;excellent pitch and phrasing.&quot;

Affectionately known as &#x27;JPL&#x27; by his fans, Lewis was a member of the third group of semi-finalists and performed the Elton John song &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;. After performing &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; in the wild card round, Lewis was put through as a finalist by audience vote, receiving 22% of all votes cast.

On April 15, 2004, Lewis was voted off in eighth place after a flashy rendition of &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; during movie songs week. During the competition, he had displayed a three-octave vocal range and developed a strong fan following. As part of the Top 10, Lewis participated in the 50-city American Idols Live tour in the summer of 2004.

==Post-&quot;Idol&quot;==
Rather than accepting business offers to use his &quot;Idol&quot; fame to release a quick pop album, Lewis decided to work on his own musical style and create original music. From late 2004 to 2006, Lewis spent the majority of his time composing original music working closely with music producer Alex Gibson of Henson Recording Studios, among other notable entities in Hollywood. &quot;Turn to Grey&quot; was among the first songs that he wrote; he composed it while on tour with the &quot;Idol&quot; finalists. Jon recorded part of the song as a homage to Jennifer Hudson after she told him that she loved singing the song around her house.

In 2005, he collaborated with Canadian songwriter/actor James Collins to write and record &quot;It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, which was released by EMI/Universal in Canada as part of the &quot;Now Christmas 2&quot; album. The song went to number thirteen on the Canadian radio charts in two weeks. In addition, a second original holiday song &quot;California Christmas&quot; was recorded by Lewis and released in 2006 for the album &quot;Breaking for the Holidays&quot; by Breaking Records. The upbeat holiday song was called a &quot;Christmas classic&quot; by Chuck Taylor of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

In September 2006, Lewis released his second single containing the songs &quot;If I Go Away&quot; and &quot;Man Like Me&quot; through his independent label, Cockaroo Entertainment. His limited release debut album, &quot;Stories from Hollywood&quot;, was released on his 27th birthday, November 7, 2006, making Jon the first Idol finalist to independently release an album of original songs. The album is a collection of energetic rock and roll and intimate acoustic tracks.

Lewis&#x27; second full-length album, &quot;Break the Silence,&quot; debuted July 22, 2008. The album was released through Cockaroo Entertainment in conjunction with Adrenaline Music Group and Lieber Management. Chris Garcia, who has worked with Santana and Michelle Branch, Dido and Jewel, produced the album under the guidance of executive producer Don Grierson, a former head of A&amp;R for Capitol and Epic Records. Lewis wrote or co-wrote several tracks for the album, featuring musicians such as guitarist Nick Lashley, drummer Kenny Aronoff and Blake Mills. The CD has received critical praise including a &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice&quot; review from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. It was called &quot;one of the best pop/rock CD&#x27;s of the year&quot; by Monica Rizzo of &quot;People&quot; magazine and &quot;a much stronger album&quot; by Ken Barnes of &quot;USA Today&quot;. The title track single hit the top 30 charts on Hot AC radio and in November 2008 was one of only fifty songs pre-programmed into all of the new iPhones on display at Apple Stores and AT&amp;T stores across the country. Lewis went on to release a self-titled EP in February 2010.

In 2009, Lewis launched an internet show titled &quot;American Nobody.&quot; The program takes an inside look at the music business as well as a tongue-in-cheek view of pop culture. The show received early critical praise. American Idol journalist and biographer Richard Rushfield described the show as, &quot;a hilarious romp through Idol land built around the misadventures of a singer who, seven years after Idol, is still searching to find his place in the industry.&quot; &quot;American Nobody&quot; was added to &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Hot Web List&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;the most brilliant and biting satire of Idoldom ever written.&quot;

Jon Peter Lewis met Ryan Hayes in Rexburg, Idaho, and became friends. In 2010, Lewis produced and starred in a rock opera, &quot;Deep Love: A Ghostly Folk Opera&quot;. The production, co-written by Ryan Hayes and Garrett Sherwood, debuted in Idaho in October 2010 and garnered support, which positioned the show into a multi-city theatrical event. Deep Love was chosen as one of ten shows produced for the New York Musical Theatre Festival in July 2015.

In 2015, Lewis released an EP titled &quot;Roughcuts.&quot; According to Lewis, the recordings are in their &quot;roughest and raw forms&quot; and &quot;they are like first drafts from my brain and may end up as Midas Whale songs.&quot;

Lewis has been a contributor to MTV, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and AOL Entertainment.

==Midas Whale==
In 2013, Jon Peter Lewis teamed up Ryan Hayes to become Midas Whale (a pun on &quot;might as well&quot;). According to Lewis, he asked Ryan if he wanted to form a band and be on TV and Ryan replied &quot;Might as well&quot;, which then became the name of the duo.

===&quot;The Voice&quot;===
In 2013, Jon Peter Lewis and Ryan Hayes auditioned for the fourth season of &quot;The Voice&quot; as duo Midas Whale. In their audition, which broadcast on March 26, 2013, they performed the Johnny Cash song &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;. All four judges pressed their &quot;I Want You&quot; button and turned their chairs. Lewis and Hayes chose to join Adam Levine&#x27;s team. They were eliminated in the knockout rounds.

===Post-&quot;The Voice&quot;===
As Midas Whale, Jon Peter Lewis released their first full-length album titled &quot;Sugar House&quot; on February 11, 2014. The album was produced by Stuart Maxfield and funded by fans via Kickstarter where they raised over $30,000.

<doc id="518759" wikidata="Q335218" url="?curid=518759" title="Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel">
<text>Herbert Louis Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel (6 November 1870 – 5 February 1963) was a British Liberal politician who was the party leader from 1931 to 1935.

He was the first nominally-practising Jew to serve as a Cabinet minister and to become the leader of a major British political party. Samuel had promoted Zionism within the British Cabinet, beginning with his 1915 memorandum entitled &quot;The Future of Palestine&quot;. In 1920 he was appointed as the first High Commissioner for Palestine, in charge of the administration of the territory.

Samuel was the last member of the Liberal Party proper to hold one of the four Great Offices of State (as Home Secretary from 1931 to 1932 in the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald). One of the adherents of &quot;New Liberalism&quot;, Samuel helped to draft and present social reform legislation while he was serving as a Liberal cabinet member. Samuel led the party in both the 1931 general election and the 1935 general election, during which period the party&#x27;s number of seats in parliament fell from 59 to 21.

==Early life==

Herbert Samuel was born at &quot;Claremont&quot; No. 11 Belvidere Road, Toxteth, Liverpool, Lancashire, in 1870. The building now houses part of the Belvedere Academy. Around 1775, his great-grandfather, Menachem Samuel, had emigrated from Kempen in Posen (now Kępno), not far from the city of Posen (now Poznań), to Britain and his grandfather, Louis Samuel (1794-1859), was born in London. He was the son of Clara (Yates) and Edwin Louis Samuel (1825–1877). His uncle was born Montagu Samuel, but became better known as Samuel Montagu, founder of the eponymous bank. He was also known by a Hebrew name, Eliezer ben Pinchas Shmuel. His eldest brother, Sir Stuart Samuel, was also a successful Liberal politician; his only sister, Mabel (1862–1938) married the influential art-critic Marion Spielmann, from the Spielmann dynasty of bankers and art-connoisseurs.

He was educated at University College School in Hampstead, London and Balliol College, Oxford, but at home he had a Jewish upbringing. However, in 1892, while at Oxford he renounced all religious belief, writing to his mother to inform her. Samuel worked through the influence of Charles Darwin and the book &quot;On Compromise&quot; by senior Liberal politician John Morley. He remained a member of the Jewish community, however, to please his wife, and observed the Sabbath and Jewish food laws at home &quot;for hygienic reasons&quot;.

==Early political career==
Samuel unsuccessfully fought two general elections before being elected a Member of Parliament at the November 1902 Cleveland by-election, as a member of the Liberal Party. He was appointed to the Cabinet in 1909 by Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, first as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and then as Postmaster General, President of the Local Government Board and eventually Home Secretary.

He put forward the idea of establishing a British protectorate over Palestine in 1915, and his ideas influenced the Balfour Declaration. As Home Secretary, Samuel faced a shortage of manpower needed to fight in World War I, and he initiated legislation to offer thousands of Russian refugees (many of them young Jews) a choice between conscription into the British Army or returning to Russia for military service.

In December 1916, Asquith was replaced as prime minister by Lloyd George. Lloyd George asked Samuel to continue as Home Secretary, but Samuel chose to resign instead. He attempted to strike a balance between giving support to the new government while remaining loyal to Asquith. At the end of the war he sought election at the general election of 1918 as a Liberal in support of the Coalition government. However, the government&#x27;s endorsement was given to his Unionist opponent, and he was defeated.

===Women&#x27;s rights===
Initially he had not been a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage but then changed his position. In 1917, a Speaker&#x27;s Conference was charged with looking into giving women the vote but did not have, in its terms of reference, consideration to women standing as candidates for Parliament. However, Samuel moved a separate motion on 23 October 1918 to allow women to be eligible as Members of Parliament. The vote was passed by 274 to 25, and the government rushed through a bill to make it law in time for the 1918 election.

==High Commissioner for Palestine==
===Background===
One month after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, Samuel met Chaim Weizmann, who was to become the President of the World Zionist Organization and later the first President of Israel. According to Weizmann&#x27;s memoirs, Samuel was already an avid believer in Zionism and believed that Weizmann&#x27;s demands were too modest. Samuel did not want to enter into a detailed discussion of his plans but mentioned that &quot;the Jews would have to build railways, harbours, a university, a network of schools, etc&quot;, as well as potentially a Temple in &quot;modernised form&quot;.

In January 1915, Samuel circulated a memorandum, &quot;The Future of Palestine&quot;, to his cabinet colleagues, suggesting that Britain should conquer Palestine in order to protect the Suez Canal against foreign powers, and for Palestine to become a home for the Jewish people. The memorandum stated, &quot;I am assured that the solution of the problem of Palestine which would be much the most welcome to the leaders and supporters of the Zionist movement throughout the world would be the annexation of the country to the British Empire&quot;. In March 1915, Samuel replaced the January 1915 draft version with the final version of his memorandum, toned down from the earlier draft, explicitly ruling out any idea of immediately establishing a Jewish state and emphasizing that non-Jews must receive equal treatment under any scheme.

===Appointment as High Commissioner===

In 1917, Britain occupied Palestine (then part of the Ottoman Empire) during the course of the First World War. Samuel lost his seat in the election of 1918 and became a candidate to represent British interests in the territory.

He was appointed to the position of High Commissioner in 1920, before the Council of the League of Nations approved a British mandate for Palestine. Nonetheless, the military government withdrew to Cairo in preparation for the expected British Mandate, which was finally granted two years later by the League of Nations. He served as High Commissioner until 1925. Samuel was the first Jew to govern the historic Land of Israel in 2000 years.

He recognised Hebrew as one of the three official languages of the territory. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) on 11 June 1920.

Samuel&#x27;s appointment to High Commissioner for Palestine was controversial. While the Zionists welcomed the appointment of a Zionist Jew to the post, the military government, headed by Edmund Allenby and Louis Bols, called Samuel&#x27;s appointment &quot;highly dangerous&quot;.

Technically, Allenby noted, the appointment was illegal, as a civil administration that would compel the inhabitants of an occupied country to express their allegiance to it before a formal peace treaty (with the Ottoman Empire) was signed violated both military law and the Hague Convention. Bols said the news was received with &quot;consternation, despondency and exasperation&quot; by the Muslims and Christians. Allenby said that the Arabs would see it &quot;as handing country over at once to a permanent Zionist Administration&quot; and predicted massive violence.

Lord Curzon read the last message to Samuel and asked him to reconsider accepting the post. Samuel took advice from a delegation in London representing the Zionists, who told him that the &quot;alarmist&quot; reports were not justified. The Muslim-Christian Association had sent a telegram to Bols: Sir Herbert Samuel regarded as a Zionist leader, and his appointment as first step in formation of Zionist national home in the midst of Arab people contrary to their wishes. Inhabitants cannot recognise him, and Muslim-Christian Society cannot accept responsibility for riots or other disturbances of peace. The wisdom of appointing Samuel was debated in the House of Lords a day before he arrived in Palestine. Lord Curzon said that no &quot;disparaging&quot; remarks had been made during the debate but that &quot;very grave doubts have been expressed as to the wisdom of sending a Jewish Administrator to the country at this moment&quot;.

Questions in the House of Commons of the period also show much concern about the choice of Samuel: &quot;what action has been taken to placate the Arab population... and thereby put an end to racial tension&quot;. Three months after his arrival, &quot;The Morning Post&quot; commented: &quot;Sir Herbert Samuel&#x27;s appointment as High Commissioner was regarded by everyone, except Jews, as a serious mistake.&quot;


===Tenure===
As High Commissioner, Samuel attempted to mediate between Zionist and Arab interests, acting to slow Jewish immigration and win the confidence of the Arab population. He hoped to gain Arab participation in mandate affairs and to guard their civil and economic rights, but refused them any authority that could be used to stop Jewish immigration and land purchase. According to Wasserstein his policy was &quot;subtly designed to reconcile Arabs to the... pro-Zionist policy&quot; of the British.

Islamic custom at the time was that the chief Islamic spiritual leader, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, was to be chosen by the temporal ruler, the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, from a group of clerics nominated by the indigenous clerics. After the British conquered Palestine, Samuel chose Haj Amin al Husseini, who later proved a thorn in the side of the British administration in Palestine. At the same time, he enjoyed the respect of the Jewish community, and he was honoured by being called to the Torah at the Hurva synagogue in the Old City of Jerusalem.

During Samuel&#x27;s administration the Churchill White Paper was published. It supported Jewish immigration within the economic absorptive capacity of the country to accommodate them and defined the Jewish national homeland as:
not the imposition of a Jewish nationality upon the inhabitants of Palestine as a whole, but the further development of the existing Jewish community, with the assistance of Jews in other parts of the world, in order that it may become a centre in which the Jewish people as a whole may take, on grounds of religion and race, an interest and a pride.

Samuel won the confidence of all sections of the population by his noted &quot;impartiality&quot;. He struck a particularly strong relationship with Pinhas Rutenberg, granting him exclusive concessions to produce and distribute electricity in Palestine and Trans-Jordan, often strongly backing Rutenberg in his relations with the Colonial Office in London. Samuel government signed the Ghor-Mudawarra Land Agreement with the Baysan Valley Bedouin tribes, that earmarked for transfer 179,545 dunams of state land to the Bedouin.

Samuel&#x27;s role in Palestine is still debated. According to Wasserstein:
He is remembered kindly neither by the majority of Zionist historians, who tend to regard him as one of the originators of the process whereby the Balfour Declaration in favour of Zionism was gradually diluted and ultimately betrayed by Great Britain, nor by Arab nationalists who regard him as a personification of the alliance between Zionism and British imperialism and as one of those responsible for the displacement of the Palestinian Arabs from their homeland. In fact, both are mistaken.

==Samuel Commission==

On his return to Britain in 1925, Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin asked Samuel to look into the problems of the mining industry. The Samuel Commission published its report in March 1926, recommending a reorganisation of the industry but rejecting the suggestion of nationalisation. The report also recommended the government subsidy to be withdrawn and the miners&#x27; wages reduced. The report was one of the leading factors that led to the 1926 General Strike.

==Later political career==

Samuel returned to the House of Commons following the 1929 general election. Two years later, he became deputy leader of the Liberal Party and acted as leader in the summer of 1931 when Lloyd George was ill. Under Samuel, the party served in the first National Government of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald formed in August 1931, with Samuel himself serving as Home Secretary. However the government&#x27;s willingness to consider the introduction of protectionist tariffs and call a general election to seek a mandate led to the Liberal Party fragmenting into three distinct groups. Sir John Simon had already led a breakaway group of MPs to form the Liberal National Party.

The Liberal leader, Lloyd George, led a small group of Independent Liberals, opposing the National Government. That left Samuel effectively as leader of the parliamentary party and in control of party headquarters. The government&#x27;s moves to introduce tariffs caused further friction for the Liberals, and Samuel withdrew the party from the government in stages, first obtaining the suspension of cabinet collective responsibility on the matter to allow Liberal members of the government to oppose tariffs. In October 1932, the Liberal ministers resigned their ministerial posts but continued to support the National Government in parliament. Finally, in November 1933, Samuel and the bulk of the Liberal MPs crossed the floor of the House of Commons and opposed the government outright. He remained leader of the Liberal Party until he again lost his seat in 1935.

In 1937, he was granted the title Viscount Samuel; later that year, Samuel, despite his Jewish ancestry, aligned himself with Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s appeasement policy towards Adolf Hitler, urged that Germany be cleared of its 1914 war guilt and recommended the return of German colonies lost after the war. His biographer John Edward Bowle noted Samuel&#x27;s recollection of his comments to Lord Halifax in a conversation shortly before the Anschluss in 1938:

I said that I regarded Hitler as a man with a conscience — a conscience that sometimes led him to do things that were very bad; but he was not a man who would do what he knew to be a crime as Napoleon would have. The danger was that, being a mystic and impetuous, he might easily be swept away at some moment of crisis.

He declined a later offer by Chamberlain to return to government. In 1938, he supported the &quot;Kindertransport&quot; movement for refugee children from Europe with an appeal for homes for them.

Samuel later became the leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Lords (1944–1955). During the 1951 general election, on 15 October 1951, Samuel became the first British politician to deliver a party political broadcast on television. He had previously fronted a broadcast on television at the 1950 election, but this was merely a recording of a radio speech he had made earlier the same evening rather than a true party political broadcast.

==Family==
On 17 November 1897 Samuel married his first cousin Beatrice Miriam (1871–1959), daughter of Ellis Abraham Franklin, a banker. They had three sons and one daughter. His son, Edwin, served in the Jewish Legion.

Samuel was great-uncle to the scientist Rosalind Franklin, the co-discoverer of DNA.

==Literary career==
In his later years, he remained concerned over the future of humanity and of science, writing three books: &quot;Essays in Physics&quot; (1951), &quot;In Search of Reality&quot; (1957) and a collaborative work, &quot;A Threefold Cord: Philosophy, Science, Religion&quot; (1961). The three works tended to conflict with the beliefs of the scientific establishment, especially as his collaborator and friend in the last work was Herbert Dingle.
