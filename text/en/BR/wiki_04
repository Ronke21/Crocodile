<text>Eldoret is a city in the Rift Valley region of Kenya. It serves as the capital of Uasin Gishu County. Located in western Kenya, and lying south of the Cherangani Hills, the local elevation varies from about at the Eldoret International Airport to more than in nearby areas. 

As per the 2019 population census, Eldoret has a population of 475,716 people and is the fifth most populated urban area in the country after Nairobi, Mombasa, Nakuru and Ruiru.

A long standing municipality, Eldoret was conferred city status on 15 August 2024, making it the fifth city of Kenya.

The city is a significant urban area in Kenya; it is the second largest medical destination in Kenya after Nairobi and hosts the largest university student population outside of the nation&#x27;s capital. Its international airport is ranked as the second busiest cargo airport after JKIA in Nairobi and has the second largest coverage by financial institutions outside of the capital with over 40 branches in town. The city also hosts a substantial manufacturing sector.

The city was referred to as Farm 64 during the colonial period and is still colloquially referred to by locals as &#x27;Sisibo&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Eldoret&quot; is based on the Maasai word &quot;eldore&quot; meaning &quot;stony river&quot;; a reference to the bed of the Sosiani River (a tributary of the Nile), that runs through the town.

==History==
Eldoret and the plateau around it had been occupied by the Sirikwa for several centuries prior to the era of Maasai ascendancy. Innovation in weaponry was introduced by the Maasai era of the late 18th and 19th centuries. With new weapons and forms of governance, they swept down from their original homelands in the north, closer to Lake Turkana, down to their present homelands south of Kenya. The Maasai clan that took over the Plateau were known as the Ilwasin Kishu, after whom it is presently named.

In August 1908, fifty-eight families of displaced Afrikaners left Nakuru for the Uasin Gishu plateau after a journey from South Africa by sea and by rail from Mombasa. Led by Jan van Rensburg, they traveled using wagons that would often get stuck in mud, finally arriving at Sergoit Hill on 22 October of that year. Jan Ernest Kruger would later own the Sergoit farm, now owned by Sergoit Golf and Wildlife resort.

The land had earlier been surveyed by a certain van Breda and the new arrivals took up leaseholds of between on condition that they would develop it within five years. Each family built a shack, put up fences, in-spanned oxen to simple ploughs and turned the first furrows. They sowed wheat, maize and vegetables. These actions laid the foundation for the transformation of the Plateau into a prosperous agricultural region.

The farms were later officially registered and each was given a number.

Eldoret was established in the midst of the farms they created on what was known to the settlers as &quot;Farm 64&quot;, &quot;64&quot; or &quot;Sisibo&quot; to the locals because at that time it was from the newly built Uganda Railway railhead at Londiani. Willy van Aardt owned the farm. The Central Lounge in Eldoret is all that remains of Willy&#x27;s farm.

The official town site started in 1910 with the development of a Post Office at &quot;Sisibo&quot;. This was followed shortly after by the arrival of 60 more Afrikaner families in 1911. The governor decided to establish an administrative centre in the area in 1912 and thus the Post Office was renamed from &quot;64&quot; to a new official town name: &quot;Eldoret&quot;. Becoming an administrative centre caused an enormous increase in trade within the prospective city. A bank and several shops were built.

The Uganda Railway extension, from Londiani towards Uganda, reached Eldoret in 1924, starting a new era of prosperity and growth. In 1928, a piped water supply from the Sosiani River was installed and in 1933, an electricity generator plant was installed by the East African Power and Lighting Company. By that time, Eldoret had a small airport, and low-cost rental housing had been constructed.

In the 1950s the town was literally divided into two, along the main street (now Uganda Road), with the Afrikaners on the north and the British on the south. The former took their children to Highland School, (now Moi Girls High School) and the latter, to Hill School. Recreation was also along the divide – &#x27;Brits&#x27; used the Lincoln Hotel and the Race-Course near the now &quot;Chinese Area&quot; while the Afrikaners converged at the Wagon Wheel for recreation.

Daniel Arap Moi was born in the neighboring Baringo District, and under his presidency, the town was developed further. The country&#x27;s second institution of higher learning, Moi University, was established by the government in 1984 and the third international airport was subsequently constructed, significantly boosting the fortunes of the town.

By 1987, only two Afrikaner households remained in Eldoret, with the rest having moved back to South Africa in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in the aftermath of the Mau Mau rebellion and in anticipation of independence.

The town was significantly impacted by the 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis when violence gripped Kenya in the aftermath of controversial general elections. The athlete Lucas Sang was murdered about away from the town while on his way home to Chepkoilel. On 1 January 2008, a mob attacked and set fire to a church located near Burnt Forest, a satellite town of Eldoret. Hundreds of people had taken refuge during Kenyan massacres. As a result, about forty to eighty people, mostly Kikuyu, were burnt to death.

William Ruto the current President of the Republic of Kenya was born in Kamagut Ward of Turbo Constituency that straddles Eldoret town. He has previously represented Eldoret North Constituency in parliament.

== Climate ==

Eldoret has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The town, lying over above sea level, has a moderate to cool climate. The temperature falls significantly at night, and in the cold season (May–August) it is regularly in the single digits Celsius. The warm season is the driest and the cool season is the wettest, making the town have a pattern similar to that of a Mediterranean climate. 
==Population==
==Local governance==
Eldoret is governed by the County Government of Uasin Gishu which manages all the town&#x27;s affairs. The city is divided into thirteen wards. Six of them (Huruma, Kamukunji, Kapyemit, Kidiwa/Kapsuswa, and Stadium/Industrial, Market) are in Eldoret North Constituency, Three (Hospital, Kapsoya and Kimumu/Sergoit) are in Eldoret East Constituency, and the remaining four (Kipkenyo, Langas, Pioneer/Elgon View and Race Course) are part of Eldoret South Constituency. All of these three constituencies have more wards within other local authorities than Eldoret municipality.

===Suburbs===
Eldoret has a number of estates. Estates vary in that some are posh and others are resided in by the middle-class community. Almost every estate has its own identity. Some of the estates include Elgon View, Langas, Kapseret, Huruma, Kapsoya, Shauri, Kipkorgot, Kahoya, West Indies, West, Kipkaren, Kimumu, Jerusalem, Annex, Mwanzo,Hawaii, Action, Mailinne, Pioneer, Outspan, Kiplombe, Kamkunji, Samar, Silas, Kenya Service, Cheplaskei, Chinese, Road Block, Peris, Junction, Munyaka, Hillside, Eldoville, Juniorate among many others.

==Economy==

Eldoret is surrounded by prime agricultural lands and acts as a trading centre for Uasin Gishu&#x27;s economy which is driven by large-scale grain farming, dairy and horticultural farming. The town is also a local manufacturing hub with a number of nationally recognised manufacturing concerns, including Raiplywoods, Rupa Textiles, Kenya Pipeline Company, Kenya Co-operative Creameries as well as corn, wheat and pyrethrum factories all within the town.

The city is home to a large market and is known for the &quot;Doinyo Lessos&quot; cheese factory, Moi University and Eldoret International Airport. The runners from Eldoret have also contributed significantly to the economy of Eldoret town, primarily investing in small businesses and real estate, from their winnings in races all over the world. Moses Kiptanui is a stake holder in one of the largest buildings, Komora, that houses a large supermarket chain and many offices.
Notable professional firms include Nyairo and Company, the oldest law firm in the town`, founded by Alfred Momanyi Nyairo in the sixties. Other law firms include Wabomba Masinde and Associates advocates, Gumbo and Associate Advocates, Mburu Maina &amp; Company Advocates, Nyaundi Tuiyott &amp; Company Advocates, Kalya &amp; Company Advocates, Chebii and Company Advocates and Gicheru &amp; Company Advocates.

===Industries===
====Textiles====
The city has an industry that is led by Ken Knit (Kenya). It is the first, fully integrated textile manufacturing company in East and Central Africa and has been based in Eldoret for close to 50 years. It is Kenya&#x27;s leading manufacturer of wool products and with a workforce of 2,000, is presently the largest textile related employer in the North-Rift.

Another notable textile firm is Rivatex EA which was opened in 1975 by then Vice President, Daniel Toroitich arap Moi as Rift Valley Textiles (Rivatex), a parastatal that was the first Kenyan textile mill to operate computerized mills. It quickly became a success, achieving profitability within three years while employing 400 people and consuming 3,000 tons of cotton a year at its peak. By the late 1990s, the liberalization of Kenya&#x27;s market which led to massive imports of cheap used clothing coupled with mismanagement led to the decline of the country&#x27;s textile industry. Rivatex in Eldoret was placed under receivership in 1998 and finally shut its doors in 2000.

The city of Eldoret, through Moi University and its subsidiary firm Rivatex, has played a leading role in the revival of the Kenyan textile industry.

The defunct Rivatex was purchased from the Government of Kenya in 2007 by Moi University as a facility for research, product development, extension and production. The university identified the high cost of imported dyes as a factor affecting profitability. This was resolved in 2008, when Prof Richard Mibey, invented the Tami Dye, a natural dye made from Mexican Marigold which was previously considered a weed in the surrounding regions. The university holds the patent to this dye.

Being able to produce affordable dye in Kenya has been a key contributing factor to the revival of Rivatex East Africa and the wider Kenyan textile industry. The university won a $60 million grant from the World Bank to carry out a face-lift as a result of the work on the Tami Dye. It also secured a pledged investment of $40 million from the Indian Government.

====Digital assembly====
In mid-2019, Rivatex reopened following major renovations and restructuring. As part of this effort, it opened a Digital Assembly Plant with the capacity to produce laptops, tablets, electric meters, smartphones and other digital devices.

====Military====
The city is host to the Moi Barracks for the Kenya Defence Forces. The barracks has a memorial for Kenyan soldiers killed in battle in Somalia. The city is also home to the Kenya Ordnance Factories Corporation since 1997, a military installation that was the first manufacturer of small arms and ammunition in the region. Its customers include the Kenya Police, Wildlife Service, the Army, licensed dealers and carriers as well as friendly governments.

====Fertilizer====
The Toyota Tsusho Corporation built Kenya&#x27;s first full scale fertilizer blending factory at Ngeria on the outskirts of Eldoret. The $15 million plant has the capacity to produce 150,000 tonnes per year which is 25% of Kenya&#x27;s 600,000 annual requirement.

===Services===
====ICT====
In early 2019, Safaricom, Kenya&#x27;s largest mobile network operator, set up its second largest call centre, and its first outside Nairobi, in Eldoret town. The Kshs 900 million facility provides employment to 800 individuals of whom 300 are paid interns from local universities.

The town is also home to the MGW site, located at Kapsoya, the first of Safaricom&#x27;s data centre in the North Rift, set up in 2015.

====Tourism====
Eldoret has traditionally not been known as a tourist destination and does not have much to differentiate it from Kenya&#x27;s other highland centres. Being Kenya&#x27;s fifth-largest town however, it is a great deal bigger and serves as a base for touring the North-Rift circuit. The town has a decent variety of accommodation options, notably the Sirikwa Hotel, Poa Place, The Noble Hotel and Conference Centre and the ultra-modern Boma Inn as well as enough night-life options to interest one for an evening or two.

====Surrounding region====

The town and its surrounding regions has also lately grown into a sports tourism destination thanks to a number of residents, renowned world runners and a high-altitude that makes the local area suitable for athletics training.

Notable attractions within easy distance of Eldoret include the Nandi Hills area to the south, home of the Nandi, the fiercest early opponents to British rule. It is also the home of the Chemosit, a crypto-beast that is said to devour human brains. 
To the north lies the town of Iten, capital of Elgeyo Marakwet county and the world&#x27;s foremost source of elite-middle and long distance runners. It is a popular destination for foreigners looking to hone their athletics talent and time at its high altitude training centres form part of a number of elite athletes training regimens. Notably, altitude training here was a key element of Mo Farah&#x27;s preparations before his 5000m and 10000m gold medals at London 2012 and World Championships 2013.

Elgeyo Marakwet is also increasingly gaining a global reputation as a paragliding destination. It has become the place to go to fly out-and-returns in January with world records across both distances having been set in the Kerio Valley in 2013 and 2014 respectively.

The town of Eldoret is served by two aerodromes, Eldoret International Airport and Eldoret Airstrip.
Eldoret International Airport is a regional airport approximately from Eldoret city. It has daily scheduled flights to Nairobi and Lodwar and weekly international cargo flights operated by Emirates and Etihad Airways.

====Railway====
The town is also served by the Kenya-Uganda railway.Construction began in 1920, reaching Eldoret in 1924 and winding up at Kampala in 1930. This extension put Eldoret town itself 64 miles away from the railhead, an occurrence that birthed the town’s famous moniker of Farm 64 which morphed into Sisibo through vernacular influence. Construction of the Eldoret line paved the way for the extension of other branch lines into areas of high European settlement such as Kitale, Nyahururu, and Nanyuki. Railway presence in these towns created a reliable means of transporting farm produce, thus leading to their growth and development as the colony’s bread baskets. 

====Power====

<text>The First Anglo-Afghan War () was fought between the British Empire and the Emirate of Kabul from 1838 to 1842. The British initially successfully invaded the country taking sides in a succession dispute between emir Dost Mohammad Khan (Barakzai) and former King Shah Shujah (Durrani), whom they reinstalled upon occupying Kabul in August 1839. The main British Indian force occupied Kabul and endured harsh winters. The force and its camp followers were almost completely massacred during the 1842 retreat from Kabul.

The British then sent what was widely termed an &quot;Army of Retribution&quot; to Kabul to avenge the destruction of the previous forces. After recovering prisoners, they left Afghanistan by the end of the year. Dost Mohammed returned from exile in India to resume his rule.

It was one of the first major conflicts during the Great Game, the 19th century competition for power and influence in Central Asia between Britain and Russia.

==Background==
===Causes===
The 19th century was a period of diplomatic competition between the British and Russian empires for spheres of influence in South Asia known as the &quot;Great Game&quot; to the British and the &quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot; to the Russians. With the exception of Emperor Paul (whose 1800 order to invade India was cancelled after his assassination in 1801), no Russian tsar ever seriously considered invading India. However, for most of the 19th century, Russia was viewed as &quot;the enemy&quot; in Britain; any Russian advance into Central Asia, into what is now Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, was always assumed (in London) to be directed towards the conquest of India, as the American historian David Fromkin observed, &quot;no matter how far-fetched&quot; such an interpretation might be. In 1832, the First Reform Bill lowering the franchise requirements to vote and hold office in the United Kingdom was passed, which the ultra-conservative Emperor Nicholas I of Russia openly disapproved of, setting the stage for an Anglo-Russian &quot;cold war&quot;, with many believing that Russian autocracy and British democracy were bound to clash. In 1837, Lord Palmerston and John Hobhouse, fearing the instability of Afghanistan, the Sindh, and the increasing power of the Sikh kingdom to the northwest, raised the spectre of a possible Russian invasion of British India through Afghanistan. The British tended to misunderstand the foreign policy of the Emperor Nicholas I as anti-British and intent upon an expansionary policy in Asia; whereas in fact though Nicholas disliked Britain as a liberal democratic state that he considered to be rather &quot;strange&quot;, he always believed it was possible to reach an understanding with Britain on spheres of influence in Asia, believing that the essentially conservative nature of British society would retard the advent of liberalism. The main goal of Nicholas&#x27;s foreign policy was not the conquest of Asia, but rather upholding the &quot;status quo&quot; in Europe, especially by co-operating with Prussia and Austria, and in isolating France, as Louis Philippe I, the King of the French was a man whom Nicholas hated as an &quot;usurper&quot;. The duc d&#x27;Orleans had once been Nicholas&#x27;s friend, but when he assumed the throne of France after the revolution of 1830, Nicholas was consumed with hatred for his former friend who, as he saw it, had gone over to what he perceived as the dark side of liberalism. The idea that Russia was a threat to the East India Company is one version of events. Scholars now favour a different interpretation that the fear of the East India Company was in fact the decision of Dost Mohammed Khan and the Qajar Ruler of Iran to form an alliance and extinguish Sikh rule in Punjab. The British feared that an invading Islamic army would lead to an uprising in India by the people and princely states therefore it was decided to replace Dost Mohammed Khan with a more pliant ruler. &quot;Rumours could cost lives and Empire itself. Therefore instead of fixating on the oriental other, the East India Company played up the threat of the Russian bear&quot;.

In 1834, Shah Shuja Durrani invaded Kandahar with the aid of the British, but was defeated.

The Company sent an envoy to Kabul to form an alliance with Afghanistan&#x27;s Amir, Dost Mohammad Khan against Russia. Amidst the Afghan civil war, the Sikhs seized Peshawar from the Peshawar sardars and subjugated them. The British feared the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot;, and they considered the Sikh army to be a far more formidable threat than the Afghans who did not have a well-disciplined army, instead of having only a tribal levy where under the banner of &quot;jihad&quot; tribesmen would come out to fight for the Emir. For this reason, Lord Auckland preferred an alliance with the Punjab over an alliance with Afghanistan. The British could have had an alliance with the Punjab or Afghanistan, but not both at the same time.

When Governor-General of India Lord Auckland heard about the arrival of Russian envoy Count Jan Prosper Witkiewicz (better known by the Russian version of his name as Yan Vitkevich) in Kabul and the possibility that Dost Mohammad might turn to Russia for support, his political advisers exaggerated the threat. Alexander Burnes, the Scotsman who served as the East India Company&#x27;s chief political officer in Afghanistan, described Witkiewicz: &quot;He was a gentlemanly and agreeable man, of about thirty years of age, spoke French, Turkish and Persian fluently, and wore the uniform of an officer of the Cossacks&quot;. The presence of Witkiewicz had thrown Burnes into a state of despair, leading one contemporary to note that he &quot;abandoned himself to despair, bound his head with wet towels and handkerchiefs and took to the smelling bottle&quot;. Dost Mohammad had in fact invited Count Witkiewicz to Kabul as a way to frighten the British into making an alliance with him against his archenemy Ranjit Singh, the Maharaja of the Punjab, not because he really wanted an alliance with Russia. The British had the power to compel Singh to return the former Afghan territories he had conquered whereas the Russians did not, which explains why Dost Mohammad Khan wanted an alliance with the British. Burnes wrote home after having dinner with Count Witkiewicz and Dost Mohammad in late December 1837: &quot;We are in a mess home. The emperor of Russia has sent an envoy to Kabul to offer...money [to the Afghans] to fight Rajeet Singh!!! I could not believe my own eyes or ears.&quot; On 20 January 1838, Lord Auckland sent an ultimatum to Dost Mohammad telling him: &quot;You must desist from all correspondence with Russia. You must never receive agents from them, or have aught to do with them without our sanction; you must dismiss Captain Viktevitch [Witkiewicz] with courtesy; you must surrender all claims to Peshawar&quot;. Burnes himself had complained that Lord Auckland&#x27;s letter was &quot;so dictatorial and supercilious as to indicate the writer&#x27;s intention that it should give offense&quot;, and tried to avoid delivering it for long as possible. Dost Mohammad was indeed offended by the letter, but in order to avoid a war, he had his special military advisor, the American adventurer Josiah Harlan, engage in talks with Burnes to see if some compromise could be arranged. Burnes in fact had no power to negotiate anything, and Harlan complained that Burnes was just stalling, which led to Dost Mohammad expelling the British diplomatic mission on 26 April 1838.

British fears of a Persian and Afghan invasion of India took one step closer to becoming a reality when negotiations between the Afghans and Russians broke down in 1838. The Qajar dynasty of Persia, with Russian support, attempted the Siege of Herat. Herat, in Afghanistan, is a city that had historically belonged to Persia; the Qajar shahs had long desired to take it back. It is located in a plain so fertile that is known as the &quot;Granary of Central Asia&quot;; whoever controls Herat and the surrounding countryside also controls the largest source of grain in all of Central Asia. Russia, wanting to increase its presence in Central Asia, had formed an alliance with Qajar Persia, which had territorial disputes with Afghanistan as Herat had been part of the Safavid Persia before 1709. Lord Auckland&#x27;s plan was to drive away the besiegers and replace Dost Mohammad with Shuja Shah Durrani, who had once ruled Afghanistan and who was willing to ally himself with anyone who might restore him to the Afghan throne. At one point, Shuja had hired an American adventurer - Josiah Harlan - to overthrow Dost Mohammad Khan, despite the fact Harlan&#x27;s military experience comprised only working as a surgeon with the East India Company&#x27;s troops in the First Burma War. Shuja Shah had been deposed in 1809 and had been living in exile in British India since 1818, collecting a pension from the East India Company, which believed that he might be useful one day. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, claiming they were merely supporting its &quot;legitimate&quot; Shuja government &quot;against foreign interference and factious opposition.&quot; Shuja Shah by 1838 was barely remembered by most of his former subjects and those that did viewed him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler who, as the British were soon to learn, had almost no popular support in Afghanistan.

On 1 October 1838, Lord Auckland issued the Simla Declaration attacking Dost Mohammed Khan for making &quot;an unprovoked attack&quot; on the empire of &quot;our ancient ally, Maharaja Ranjeet Singh&quot;, going on to declare that Shuja Shah was &quot;popular throughout Afghanistan&quot; and would enter his former realm &quot;surrounded by his own troops and be supported against foreign interference and factious opposition by the British Army&quot;. As the Persians had broken off the siege of Herat and the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia had ordered Count Vitkevich home (he was to commit suicide upon reaching St. Petersburg), the reasons for attempting to put Shuja Shah back on the Afghan throne had vanished. The British historian Sir John William Kaye wrote that the failure of the Persians to take Herat &quot;cut from under the feet of Lord Auckland all ground of justification and rendered the expedition across the Indus at once a folly and a crime&quot;. But at this point, Auckland was committed to putting Afghanistan into the British sphere of influence and nothing would stop him from going ahead with the invasion. On 25 November 1838, the two most powerful armies on the Indian subcontinent assembled in a grand review at Ferozepore as Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Punjab brought out the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; to march alongside the sepoy troops of the East India Company and the British troops in India with Lord Auckland himself present amid much colorful pageantry and music as men dressed in brightly colored uniforms together with horses and elephants marched in an impressive demonstration of military might. Lord Auckland declared that the &quot;Grand Army of the Indus&quot; would now start the march on Kabul to depose Dost Mohammed and put Shuja Shah back on the Afghan throne, ostensibly because the latter was the rightful Emir, but in reality to place Afghanistan into the British sphere of influence. Speaking in the House of Lords, the Duke of Wellington condemned the invasion, saying that the real difficulties would only begin after the invasion&#x27;s success, predicting that the Anglo-Indian forces would rout the Afghan tribal levy, only to find themselves struggling to hold on, as the Hindu Kush mountains and Afghanistan had no modern roads, and calling the entire operation &quot;stupid&quot; since Afghanistan was a land of &quot;rocks, sands, deserts, ice and snow&quot;.

===Forces===
British India at this time was a proprietary colony run by the East India Company, which had been granted the right to rule India by the British Crown. India was only one of several proprietary colonies in the British Empire around the world, where various corporations or individuals had been granted the right to rule by the Crown, with for instance Rupert&#x27;s Land, which was a vast tract covering most of what is now Canada being ruled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, but India was easily the most wealthy and profitable of all the proprietary colonies. By the 19th century, the East India Company ruled 90 million Indians and controlled 70 million acres (243,000 square kilometres) of land under its own flag while issuing its own currency, making it into the most powerful corporation in the world. The East India Company had been granted monopolies on trade by the Crown, but it was not owned by the Crown, though the shares in the East India Company were owned by numerous MPs and aristocrats, creating a powerful Company lobby in Parliament while the Company regularly gave &quot;gifts&quot; to influential people in Britain. The East India Company was sufficiently wealthy to maintain the three Presidency armies, known after their presidencies as the Bengal Army, the Bombay Army and the Madras Army, with the supreme field headquarters for commanding these armies being at Simla. The East India Company&#x27;s army totaled 200,000 men, making it one of the largest armies in the entire world, and was an army larger than those maintained by most European states. The majority of the men serving in the presidency armies were Indian, but the officers were all British, trained at the East India Company&#x27;s own officer school at the Addiscombe estate outside of London. Furthermore, the politically powerful East India Company had regiments from the British Army sent to India to serve alongside the East India Company&#x27;s army. Officers from the British Army serving in India tended to look down on officers serving in the company&#x27;s army, and relations between the two armies were cool at best.

The regiments chosen for the invasion of Afghanistan came from the Bengal and Bombay armies. The commander in India, Sir Henry Fane, chose the regiments by drawing lots. The units from the Bengal Army going into Afghanistan were Skinner&#x27;s Horse, the 43rd Native Infantry and the 2nd Light Cavalry, which were all Company regiments while the 16th Lancers and the 13th Somersethire Light Infantry came from the British Army in India. The units from the Bombay Army chosen for the Grand Army of the Indus were the 19th Native Infantry and the Poona Local Horse, which were Company regiments, and the 2nd Queen&#x27;s Regiment, the 17th Lincolnshire Regiment, and the 4th Dragoons, which were all British Army regiments. Of the two divisions of the Grand Army of the Indus, the Bombay division numbered fifty-six hundred men and the Bengal division numbered ninety-five hundred men. Shuja recruited 6,000 Indian mercenaries (&quot;Shah Shujah&#x27;s Levy&quot;) out of his pocket for the invasion. Ranjit Singh, the elderly and ailing Maharaja of the Punjab and the British assembled in a grand review at Ferozepore as Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Punjab brought out the &quot;Dal Khalsa&quot; to march alongside the sepoy troops of the East India Company and the British troops in India. Ranjit Singh agreed to a treaty with the British viceroy Lord Auckland to restore Shah Shoja to the Afghan throne in Kabul. In pursuance of this agreement, the British army of the Indus entered Afghanistan from the south, while Ranjit Singh&#x27;s troops went through the Khyber Pass and took part in the victory parade in Kabul. Accompanying the invasion force were 38,000 Indian camp followers and 30,000 camels to carry supplies.

The Emirate of Afghanistan had no army, and instead under the Afghan feudal system, the tribal chiefs contributed fighting men when the Emir called upon their services. The Afghans were divided into numerous ethnic groups, of which the largest were the Pashtuns, the Tajiks, the Uzbeks, and the Hazaras, who were all in their turn divided into numerous tribes and clans. Islam was the sole unifying factor binding these groups together, though the Hazaras were Shia Muslims while the rest were Sunni Muslims. The Pashtuns were the dominant ethnic group, and it was with the Pashtun tribes that the British interacted the most. The Pashtun tribesmen had no military training, but the ferociously warlike Pashtuns were forever fighting each other, when not being called up for service for the tribal levy by the Emir, meaning most Pashtun men had at least some experience of warfare. The Pashtun tribes lived by their strict moral code of &quot;Pashtunwali&quot; (&quot;the way of the Pashtuns&quot;) stating various rules for a Pashtun man to live by, one of which was that a man had to avenge any insult, real or imagined, with violence, in order to be considered a man. The standard Afghan weapon was a matchlock rifle known as the jezail.

==War==
===British invasion of Afghanistan===
The &quot;Army of the Indus&quot; which included 21,000 British and Indian troops under the command of John Keane, 1st Baron Keane (subsequently replaced by Sir Willoughby Cotton and then by William Elphinstone) set out from Punjab in December 1838. With them was William Hay Macnaghten, the former chief secretary of the Calcutta government, who had been selected as Britain&#x27;s chief representative to Kabul. It included an immense train of 38,000 camp followers and 30,000 camels, plus a large herd of cattle. The British intended to be comfortable – one regiment took its pack of foxhounds, another took two camels to carry its cigarettes, junior officers were accompanied by up to 40 servants, and one senior officer required 60 camels to carry his personal effects.
By late March 1839 the British forces had crossed the Bolan Pass, reached the southern Afghan city of Quetta, and begun their march to Kabul. They advanced through rough terrain, across deserts and 4,000-metre-high mountain passes, but made good progress and finally set up camps at Kandahar on 25 April 1839. After reaching Kandahar, Keane decided to wait for the crops to ripen before resuming his march, so it was not until 27 June that the Grand Army of the Indus marched again. Keane left behind his siege engines in Kandahar, which turned out to be a mistake as he discovered that the walls of the Ghazni fortress were far stronger than he expected. A deserter, Abdul Rashed Khan, a nephew of Dost Mohammad Khan, informed the British that one of the gates of the fortress was in bad state of repair and might be blasted open with a gunpowder charge. Before the fortress, the British were attacked by a force of the Ghilji tribesmen fighting under the banner of &quot;jihad&quot; who were desperate to kill &quot;farangis&quot;, a pejorative Pashtun term for the British, and were beaten off. The British took fifty prisoners who were brought before Shuja, where one of them stabbed a minister to death with a hidden knife. Shuja had them all beheaded, which led Sir John Kaye, in his official history of the war, to write this act of &quot;wanton barbarity&quot;, the &quot;shrill cry&quot; of the &quot;Ghazis&quot;, would be remembered as the &quot;funeral wail&quot; of the government&#x27;s &quot;unholy policy&quot;.

On 23 July 1839, in a surprise attack, the British-led forces captured the fortress of Ghazni, which overlooks a plain leading eastward into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The British troops blew up one city gate and marched into the city in a euphoric mood. During the battle, the British suffered 200 killed and wounded, while the Afghans suffered 500 killed and 1,500 captured. Ghazni was well-supplied, which eased the further advance considerably.

Following this and an uprising of Tajiks in Istalif, the British marched to Kabul with no resistance from Dost Mohammad&#x27;s troops. With his situation rapidly deteriorating, Dost Mohammed offered to accept Shuja as his overlord in exchange for becoming his wazir (a common practice in Pashtunwali), which was promptly turned down. In August 1839, after thirty years, Shuja was again enthroned in Kabul. Shuja promptly confirmed his reputation for cruelty by seeking to wreak vengeance on all who had crossed him as he considered his own people to be &quot;dogs&quot; who needed to be taught to obey their master.

In the absence of the traditional winter capital of Peshawar, on November 2 Shuja left the Bala Hissar to seek refuge from the cold in Jalalabad.

===Qalat/Kalat===
On 13 November 1839, while en route to India, the Bombay column of the British Indian Army attacked, as a form of reprisal, the Baloch tribal fortress of Kalat, from where Baloch tribes had harassed and attacked British convoys during the move towards the Bolan Pass.

===Dost Mohammed flees to Bukhara and growth of Resistance===
With Shah Shuja&#x27;s regime continuing to grow in unpopularity, resistance already began formulating in Autumn 1839, with raids from Ghilzais attacking the Kabul-Ghazni road led to the death of British Lieutenant Colonel Herring. Beyond the Hindu Kush, diplomats of Dost Mohammad were sent to the rulers of Balkh and Bukhara to appeal to them for aid against the British. These risks forced the British to continue to keep troops they were planning to send back to India. Dost Mohammad&#x27;s request for aid, however, did not come lightly received, as Dost Mohammad had invaded the realm of Balkh just before the British invasion. As from this invasion, Dost Mohammad had annexed Saighan, Balkh, Kahmard, and Duab.

In the winter of 1839, against the advice of Jabbar Khan, Dost Mohammad traveled to Bukhara to be received in person to appeal to the ruler of Bukhara in person. Dost Mohammad along with his sons, Akram Khan and Afzal Khan were initially well received, respected as guests. However, it came clear that the ruler of Bukhara was not willing to support Dost Mohammad. Instead, Dost Mohammad was essentially put under house arrest, and later treated as a prisoner. Suspicions even rose that the ruler of Bukhara would try to have Dost Mohammad and his sons poisoned. It was not until the following summer did Dost Mohammad escape, and through a series of events, made his way to Khulm. However, following this, he found out that Jabbar Khan had accepted Mcnaghten&#x27;s offer of amnesty and took back the women and children of Dost Mohammad&#x27;s camp. Despite his family being in British hands, Dost Mohammad did not show any intent to surrender.

The Mir Wali raised a force of over 6,000 Uzbeks, and in September 1840, marched up to Surkhab, forcing the British to abandon their outposts of Ajar, Kahmard, and Bajgah, falling back on Bamiyan. During the encounter at Bajgah, half of Shah Shuja&#x27;s cavalry while the entire force&#x27;s officers defected to the resistance&#x27;s side, while the remaining Afghan levies were captured and disarmed. Dost Mohammad followed up this success by marching on Bamiyan, however he encountered Colonel Dennie, who had an army of Gurkhas and native cavalrymen. Despite being outnumbered, Dennie ordered his Gurkhas to storm the enemy positions, successfully routing the Uzbek army. Dennie then pursued the retreating army with his cavalrymen, slaying those who had defected and the rest of the Uzbek army.

Following this victory, Dr Lord, the political officer in Bamiyan, offered Dost Mohammad honourable exile in India if he surrendered. Only to be informed that Dost Mohammad was “determined to conquer or fall in the attempt”. The Mir Wali and Murad Beg had sought co-operation, as they believed Dennie posed a threat and could possibly march all the way to Khulm. Dennie, however, was not in a position to do so due to the already overstretched Bamiyan garrison facing shortage of manpower, and as a result, they decided not to garrison Saighan, Kahmard, or Ajar. Threats of a British sponsored attack from Herat by Shah Kamran were a threat, and this forced the Wali of Maimana to pledge allegiance to Shah Shuja&#x27;s rule.

===Battle of Parwan Darra and the “Surrender” of Dost Mohammad Khan (2 November 1840)===

On 2 November 1840, Dost Mohammad finally confronted Sale&#x27;s forces, halting his advance and engaging battle at Parwan Darra. Dost Mohammad held a strong defensive position with over 400 cavalrymen, with his forces dug in on a ridge overlooking Sale&#x27;s advance. Sale sent Captain Fraser and his Bengal horse force to attack the enemy infantry, however, only a handful of men followed the order, leaving the British officers to charge against the Afghan force alone and essentially without any support. Dr Lord, earlier political officer of Bamiyan who offered Dost Mohammad terms of surrender was killed amongst this fighting that broke out. According to British historian William Dalrymple, Lord led a cavalry charge which was too late to realize that the rest of the force fled from the field. Fortunately, Fraser survived this charge and returned to British lines, however, with his sabre nearly severed at the wrist.

Dost Mohammad, seeing what had happened ordered his cavalry to lead a counter-attack, whereupon the disorganized Bengal horse force was routed, with the Afghan Cavalry chasing them in pursuit and killing many. According to the depictions of Jonathan Lee, the 2nd Bengal Horse was disgraced for their inability to follow orders, later disbanded, and erased from records. Nonetheless, following this route, Sale ordered his infantry and Qizilbash to storm the heights, and after heavy fighting and heavy casualties, they secured the ridge, to their dismay where they saw Dost Mohammad withdraw his forces in good order. Both sides withdrew, and later, the Afghans re-occupied the ridge, which was left undefended. With the ridge position, they fired onto the British camp below. As the following day came, Timur Mirza and Burnes urged Sale to abandon the campaign. This was due to the Afghan troops loyal to Shah Shuja who had not deserted, already being on the edge of mutiny, as well as Sale losing hundreds of men and many more wounded with nothing to show for it. With supplies running low as well, he obliged and returned to Charikar, crossing the Panjshir river, with those villages he had campaigned for at great cost quickly being reoccupied.
Despite Sale having little to show for the campaign and the trail of devastation left by him, Sale called Parwan Darra a victory. However he was unable to conceal the fact of the 2nd Bengal horse defying orders, and as a result, many British officers were killed. Atkinson, the armies surgeon general, called the encounter a “disaster”, Kaye also called the battle a defeat. However, early in the evening of 2 November 1840, a horsemen identified as Sultan Muhammad Khan Safi rode up to Macnaghten, as with this, he was followed by another lone horsemen, who came up to Macnaghten. This horsemen was no other than Dost Mohammad Khan.

Dost Mohammad&#x27;s surrender has been given much speculation by historians as to why he surrendered. A number of explanations range from Dost Mohammad&#x27;s surrender, oddly even after his victory at Parwan Darra. According to Jonathan lee, some of these depictions include Dost Mohammad believing that the British were destined to rule between the Indus and more. Others claim according to Jonathan lee, that, after the defeat at Saighan, Dost Mohammad was free to surrender without loss of honour. Another theory being that Dost Mohammad surrendered due to the brave suicidal charge done by Captain Fraser and Dr Lord, where he could have recognized resistance as futile. This theory however, did not make any sense as where the 2nd Bengal horse faced many defy orders to charge with them, the British lost multiple men due to this and inevitably, the battle. Another theory to Dost Mohammad&#x27;s surrender was his family being in custody with the British, and about to be exiled to British India. This theory is even less credible, however, due to the fact that the British promising to treat them honourably, as Dost was in no position regardless to change this. Nonetheless, whatever reason Dost Mohammad had surrendered for, it was clear he was not surrendering as a defeated man, as he had successfully defeated the British at Parwan Darra, and even forced their withdrawal from Bamiyan. The revolt in Kohistan also put the military favor within Dost Mohammad&#x27;s reach, yet for some reason, he decided to give up resistance. Mohan Lal gives the most clear and coherent theory was to why Dost Mohammad surrendered, as according to Lal, Dost Mohammad Khan was plotted against, and in battle, a sniper planned to assassinate him. As further explained by Lal, this was plotted out by Kohistani Amirs, who would then blame the British for this. Lal&#x27;s accounts and claims are supported by letters to Dost Mohammad Khan from Sultan Muhammad Khan of Nijrab, who had warned the Amir of a plot that was circulating from Maliks who were planning to betray and assassinate him. Abd al-Karim Alawi, who wrote a near contemporary account of the First Anglo-Afghan War, elaborates further on the details of this plot. According to Al-Karim, Sales and Burnes were in contact with the Malik of ‘Ali Hissar, who agreed to kill or capture Dost Mohammad and his two sons in exchange for a substantial payment. According to confidential information shared by British officers, Macnaghten and Burnes had been intercepting communications from Sultan Muhammad Khan of Nijrab, and his supporters. As a result, Macnaghten forged a letter from a well-wisher in Kabul, sending a letter to Dost Mohammad Khan, where it warned the Amir of a plot on his life. Dost Mohammad Khan, having read this letter, was convinced that there was indeed, a plot on his life, as he did not have reason to trust the Kohistanis, as decades prior, he attacked and razed the region. As a result, the only person he seemed to have trusted was Sultan Muhammad Khan of Nijrab. As a result, Dost Mohammad’s options were limited, as the Mir Wali and Murad Beg signed a treaty with Shah Shuja, no longer offering sanctuary for Dost Mohammad. His experience in Bukhara and how he had to escape swayed Dost Mohammad from trying to seek refuge in Balkh, as he could be imprisoned, or even killed. Therefore, he went to the only choice he could think of, the British. The British cantonment at Kabul was only a few hours ride from Parwan Darra, and he had already received assurances that he would be treated honourably in captivity and exile. As a result, Dost Mohammad’s “surrender” is treated by Jonathan Lee and many other historians as nothing akin to surrender, rather seeking refuge with the British government through an old tradition of grabbing the stirrup. An old Turco-Mongolian tradition called rikab giriftan. Atkinson states that Dost Mohammad was seeking the protection of the British government through this action, and as a result, a famous sketch was produced showing Macnaghten and Dost Mohammad shaking hands as a sign of friendship. According to Jonathan Lee, Akbar Khan had later stated that his father “Thrown himself upon the honour of the British government, in times of need”. Macnaghten was elated to hear the news, as according to Jonathan Lee, he stated: “The Afghans are gunpowder and the Dost is a lighted match”. Dost Mohammad was treated honourably, and even was housed in the Bala Hissar, with Dost Mohammad allowed to meet his family, and write to his sons that were in open resistance. Dost Mohammad was also allowed to ride on horse with an escort. During his stay in the Bala Hissar, he held a secret court, with many coming to pay their respects to the former Amir. This had shown Dost Mohammad&#x27;s popularity, and opposite to Shah Shuja&#x27;s claims, Shah Shuja was seen as unpopular by many. In Macnaghten&#x27;s letters, it was shown that he expressed sympathy for Dost Mohammad, showing a very clear contrast to what he referred to him now compared to two years prior, where he denounced Dost Mohammad in the Simla declaration. Macnaghten even asked the Governor General to treat Dost Mohammad better than when they had Shah Shuja in his exile, since to his statement: “We ejected the Dost, who never offended us, in support of our policy, of which he was the victim”.

===Occupation and rising of the Afghans===

The majority of the British troops returned to India, leaving 8,000 in Afghanistan, but it soon became clear that Shuja&#x27;s rule could only be maintained with the presence of a stronger British force. The Afghans resented the British presence and the rule of Shah Shuja. As the occupation dragged on, the East India Company&#x27;s first political officer William Hay Macnaghten allowed his soldiers to bring their families to Afghanistan to improve morale; this further infuriated the Afghans, as it appeared the British were setting up a permanent occupation. Macnaghten purchased a mansion in Kabul, where he installed his wife, crystal chandelier, a fine selection of French wines, and hundreds of servants from India, making himself completely at home. Macnaghten, who had once been a judge in a small town in Ulster before deciding he wanted to be much more than a small town judge in Ireland, was known for his arrogant, imperious manner, and was simply called &quot;the Envoy&quot; by both the Afghans and the British. The wife of one British officer, Lady Florentia Sale created an English style garden at her house in Kabul, which was much admired and in August 1841 her daughter Alexadrina was married at her Kabul home to Lieutenant John Sturt of the Royal Engineers. The British officers staged horse races, played cricket and in winter ice skating over the frozen local ponds, which astonished the Afghans who had never seen this before.

Afghanistan had no army, and instead had a feudal system under which the chiefs would maintain a certain number of armed retainers, principally cavalry together with a number of tribesmen who could be called upon to fight in a time of war; when the Emir went to war, he would call upon his chiefs to bring out their men to fight for him. In 1840, the British strongly pressured Shuja to replace the feudal system with a standing army, which threatened to do away with the power of the chiefs, and which the Emir rejected under the grounds that Afghanistan lacked the financial ability to fund a standing army.
Dost Mohammad successfully defeated the British at the battle of Parwan Darra on 2 November 1840. However, following his victory, he surrendered and was sent to India in exile after hearing rumours of assassination plots against him.

In 1839–40, the entire rationale for the occupation of Afghanistan was changed by the Oriental Crisis when Mohammad Ali the Great, the &quot;vali&quot; (governor) of Egypt who was a close French ally, rebelled against the Sublime Porte; during the subsequent crisis, Russia and Britain co-operated against France, and with the improvement in Anglo-Russian relations, the need for a buffer state in Central Asia decreased. The Oriental Crisis of 1840 almost caused an Anglo-French war, which given the long-standing Franco-Russian rivalry caused by Nicholas&#x27;s detestation of Louis-Philippe as a traitor to the conservative cause, inevitably improved relations between London and St. Petersburg, which ultimately led to the Emperor Nicholas making an imperial visit to London in 1844 to meet Queen Victoria and the Prime Minister Lord Peel. As early as 1838, Count Karl Nesselrode, the Russian Foreign Minister, had suggested to the British Ambassador in St. Petersburg, Lord Clanricarde, that Britain and Russia sign a treaty delimiting spheres of influence in Asia to end the &quot;Great Game&quot; once and for all. By 1840 Clanricarde was reporting to London that he was quite certain a mutually satisfactory agreement could be negotiated, and all he needed was the necessary permission from the Foreign Office to begin talks. From Calcutta, Lord Auckland pressed for acceptance of the Russian offer, writing &quot;I would look forward to a tripartite Treaty of the West under which a limit shall be placed to the advance of England, Russia and Persia and under which all shall continue to repress slave dealing and plunder&quot;. Though Britain rejected the Russian offer, after 1840 there was a marked decline in Anglo-Russian rivalry and a &quot;fair working relationship in Asia&quot; had developed. The British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston rejected the Russian offer to end the &quot;Great Game&quot; as he believed that as long as the &quot;Great Game&quot; continued, Britain could inconvenience Russia in Asia to better achieve her foreign policy goals in Europe much more than Russia could inconvenience Britain in Asia to achieve her foreign policy goals in Europe. Palmerston noted that because the British had more money to bribe local rulers in Central Asia, this gave them the advantage in this &quot;game&quot;, and it was thus better to keep the &quot;Great Game&quot; going. Palmerston believed it was Britain that held the advantage in the &quot;Great Game&quot;, that the Russian offer to definitely mark out spheres of influence in Asia was a sign of weakness and he preferred no such treaty be signed. From Palmerston&#x27;s viewpoint accepting the Russian offer would be unwelcome as the end of the &quot;Great Game&quot; in Asia would mean the redeployment of Russian power to Europe, the place that really counted for him, and it was better to keep the &quot;Great Game&quot; going, albeit at a reduced rate given the tensions with France. At the same time, the lowering of Anglo-Russian tension in the 1840s made holding Afghanistan more of an expensive luxury from the British viewpoint as it no longer seemed quite as essential to have a friendly government in Kabul anymore.

By this time, the British had vacated the fortress of Bala Hissar and relocated to a cantonment built to the northeast of Kabul. The chosen location was indefensible, being low and swampy with hills on every side. To make matters worse, the cantonment was too large for the number of troops camped in it and had a defensive perimeter almost two miles long. In addition, the stores and supplies were in a separate fort, 300 yards from the main cantonment. The British commander, Major-General George Keith Ephinstone who arrived in April 1841 was bed-ridden most of the time with gout and rheumatism.

Between April and October 1841, disaffected Afghan tribes were flocking to support resistance against the British in Bamiyan and other areas north of the Hindu Kush mountains. They were organised into an effective resistance by chiefs such as Mir Masjidi Khan and others. In September 1841, Macnaghten reduced the subsidies paid out to Ghilzai tribal chiefs in exchange for accepting Shuja as Emir and to keep the passes open, which immediately led to the Ghazis rebelling and a &quot;jihad&quot; being proclaimed. The monthly subsidies, which were effectively bribes for the Ghazi chiefs to stay loyal, was reduced from 80,000 to 40,000 rupees at a time of rampant inflation, and as the chiefs&#x27; loyalty had been entirely financial, the call of &quot;jihad&quot; proved stronger. Macnaghten did not take the threat seriously at first, writing to Henry Rawlinson in Kandahar on 7 October 1841: &quot;The Eastern Ghilzyes are kicking up a row about some deductions which have been made from their pay. The rascals have completely succeeded in cutting communications for the time being, which is very provoking to me at this time; but they will be well trounced for their pains. One down, t&#x27;other come on, is the principle of these vagabonds&quot;.

Macnaghten ordered an expedition. On 10 October 1841, the Ghazis in a night raid defeated the Thirty-fifth Native Infantry, but were defeated the next day by the Thirteenth Light Infantry. After their defeat, which led to the rebels fleeing to the mountains, Macnaghten overplayed his hand by demanding that the chiefs who rebelled now send their children to Shuja&#x27;s court as hostages to prevent another rebellion. As Shuja had a habit of mutilating people who displeased him in the slightest, Macnaghten&#x27;s demand that the children of the chiefs go to the Emir&#x27;s court was received with horror, which led the Ghazi chiefs to vow to fight on. Macnaghten, who had just been appointed as the governor of Bombay was torn between a desire to leave Afghanistan on a high note with the country settled and peaceful versus a desire to crush the Ghazis, which led him to temporize, at one moment threatening the harshest reprisals and the next moment, compromising by abandoning his demand for hostages. Macnaghten&#x27;s alternating policy of confrontation and compromise was perceived as weakness, which encouraged the chiefs around Kabul to start rebelling. Shuja was so unpopular that many of his ministers and the Durrani clan joined the rebellion.

On the night of 1 November 1841, a group of Afghan chiefs met at the Kabul house of one of their number to plan the uprising, which began in the morning of the next day. In a flammable situation, the spark was provided unintentionally by the East India Company&#x27;s second political officer, Sir Alexander &#x27;Sekundar&#x27; Burnes. A Kashmiri slave girl who belonged to a Pashtun chief Abdullah Khan Achakzai living in Kabul ran away to Burne&#x27;s house. When Ackakzai sent his retainers to retrieve her, it was discovered that Burnes had taken the slave girl to his bed, and he had one of Azkakzai&#x27;s men beaten. A secret &quot;jirga&quot; (council) of Pashtun chiefs was held to discuss this violation of &quot;pashtunwali&quot;, where Ackakzai holding a Koran in one hand stated: &quot;Now we are justified in throwing this English yoke; they stretch the hand of tyranny to dishonor private citizens great and small: fucking a slave girl isn&#x27;t worth the ritual bath that follows it: but we have to put a stop right here and now, otherwise these English will ride the donkey of their desires into the field of stupidity, to the point of having all of us arrested and deported to a foreign field&quot;. At the end of his speech, all of the chiefs shouted &quot;Jihad&quot;. November 2, 1841 actually fell on 17 Ramadan which was the anniversary date for the battle of Badr. The Afghans decided to strike on this date for reasons of the blessings associated with this auspicious date of 17 Ramadan. The call to jihad was given on the morning of 2 November from the Pul-i-khisti mosque in Kabul

Lady Sale wrote in her diary on 2 November 1841: &quot;This morning early, all was in commotion in Kabul. The shops were plundered and the people all fighting.&quot; That same day, a mob &quot;thirsting for blood&quot; appeared outside of the house of the East India Company&#x27;s second political officer, Sir Alexander &#x27;Sekundar&#x27; Burnes, where Burnes ordered his sepoy guards not to fire while he stood outside haranguing the mob in Pashto, attempting unconvincingly to persuade the assembled men that he did not bed their daughters and sisters. Captain William Broadfoot who was with Burnes saw the mob march forward, leading him to open fire with another officer writing in his diary that he &quot;killed five or six men with his own hand before he was shot down&quot;. The mob smashed in to Burnes&#x27;s house, where he, his brother Charles, their wives and children, several aides and the sepoys were all torn to pieces. The mob then attacked the home of the paymaster Johnston who was not present, leading to later write when he surveyed the remains of his house that they &quot;gained possession of my treasury by undermining the wall...They murdered the whole of the guard (one officer and 28 sepoys), all my servants (male, female, and children), plundered the treasury...burnt all my office records...and possessed themselves of all my private property&quot;. The British forces took no action in response despite being only five minutes away, which encouraged further revolt. The only person who took action that day was Shuja who ordered out one of his regiments from the Bala Hissar commanded by a Scots mercenary named Campbell to crush the riot, but the old city of Kabul with its narrow, twisting streets favored the defenders, with Campbell&#x27;s men coming under fire from rebels in the houses above. After losing about 200 men killed, Campbell retreated back to the Bala Hissar. After hearing of the defeat of his regiment, Shuja descended into what Kaye called &quot;a pitiable state of dejection and alarm&quot;, sinking into a deep state of depression as it finally dawned on him that his people hated him and wanted to see him dead. Captain Sturt was sent to the Bala Hissar by Elphinstone to see if it were possible to recover control of the city later that afternoon, where his mother-in-law Lady Sale noted in her diary: &quot;Just as he entered the precincts of the palace, he was stabbed in three places by a young man well dressed, who escaped into a building close-by, where he was protected by the gates being shut.&quot; Sturt was sent home to be cared for by Lady Sale and his wife with the former noting: &quot;He was covered with blood issuing from his mouth and was unable to articulate. He could not lie down, from the blood choking him&quot;, only being capable hours later to utter one word: &quot;bet-ter&quot;. Lady Sale was highly critical of Elphinstone&#x27;s leadership, writing: &quot;General Elphinstone vacillates on every point. His own judgement appears to be good, but he is swayed by the last speaker&quot;, criticising him for &quot;...a very strange circumstance that troops were not immediately sent into the city to quell the affair in the commencement, but we seem to sit quietly with our hands folded, and look on&quot;..&quot; Despite both being in the cantonment, Elphinstone preferred to write letters to Macnaghten, with one letter on 2 November saying &quot;I have been considering what can done tomorrow&quot; (he decided to do nothing that day), stating &quot;our dilemma is a difficult one&quot;, and finally concluding &quot;We must see what the morning brings&quot;. The British situation soon deteriorated when Afghans stormed the poorly defended supply fort inside Kabul on 9 November.

In the following weeks, the British commanders tried to negotiate with Akbar Khan. Macnaghten secretly offered to make Akbar Afghanistan&#x27;s vizier in exchange for allowing the British to stay, while simultaneously disbursing large sums of money to have him assassinated, which was reported to Akbar Khan. A meeting for direct negotiations between Macnaghten and Akbar was held near the cantonment on 23 December, but Macnaghten and the three officers accompanying him were seized and slain by Akbar Khan. Macnaghten&#x27;s body was dragged through the streets of Kabul and displayed in the bazaar. Elphinstone had partly lost command of his troops already and his authority was badly damaged.

===Destruction of Elphinstone&#x27;s army===
On 1 January 1842, following some unusual thinking by Major-General William George Keith Elphinstone, which may have had something to do with the poor defensibility of the cantonment, an agreement was reached that provided for the safe exodus of the British garrison and its dependents from Afghanistan. Five days later, the withdrawal began. The departing British contingent numbered around 16,500, of which about 4,500 were military personnel, and over 12,000 were camp followers. Lieutenant Vincent Eyre commented about the camp followers that &quot;These proved from the very first mile a serious clog on our movements&quot;. Lady Sale brought with her 40 servants, none of whom she named in her diary while Eyre&#x27;s son was saved by a female Afghan servant, who rode through an ambush with the boy on her back, but he never gave her name. The American author James M. Perry noted: &quot;Reading the old diaries and journals, it is almost as if these twelve thousand native servants and sepoy wives and children didn&#x27;t exist individually. In a way, they really didn&#x27;t. They would die, all of them - shot, stabbed, frozen to death - in these mountain passes, and no one bothered to write down the name of even one of them&quot;. The military force consisted mostly of Indian units and one British battalion, 44th Regiment of Foot.

They were attacked by Ghilzai warriors as they struggled through the snowbound passes. On the first day, the retreating force made only five miles and as Lady Sale wrote about their arrival at a village of Begramee: &quot;There were no tents, save two or three small palls that arrived. Everyone scraped away the snow as best they might, to make a place to lie down. The evening and night were intensely cold; no food for man or beast procurable, except a few handfuls of &quot;bhoosay&quot; [chopped stew], for which we had to pay five to ten rupees&quot;. As the night fell and with it, the temperature, dropped well below freezing. The retreating force then learned that they lost all of their supplies of food and their baggage. On the second day all of the men of the Royal Afghan Army&#x27;s 6th regiment deserted, heading back to Kabul, marking the end of the first attempt to give Afghanistan a national army. For several months afterwards, what had once been Shuja&#x27;s army was reduced to begging on the streets of Kabul as Akbar had of all of Shuja&#x27;s mercenaries mutilated before throwing them on the streets to beg. Despite Akbar Khan&#x27;s promise of safe conduct, the Anglo-Indian force was repeatedly attacked by the Ghilzais, with one especially fierce Afghan attack being beaten off with a spirited bayonet charge by the 44th Foot.

While trying to cross the Koord-Kabual pass in the Hindu Kush that was described as five miles long and &quot;so narrow and so shut in on either side that the wintry sun rarely penetrates its gloomy recesses&quot;, the Anglo-Indian force was ambushed by the Ghilzai tribesmen. Johnson described &quot;murderous fire&quot; that forced the British to abandon all baggage while camp followers regardless of sex and age were cut down with swords. Lady Sale wrote: &quot;Bullets kept whizzing by us&quot; while some of the artillerymen smashed open the regimental store of brandy to get drunk amid the Afghan attacks. Lady Sale wrote she drank a tumbler of sherry &quot;which at any other time would have made me very unlady-like, but now merely warmed me.&quot; Lady Sale took a bullet in her wrist while she had to watch as her son-in-law Sturt had &quot;...his horse was shot out from him and before he could rise from the ground he received a severe wound in the abdomen&quot;. With his wife and mother-in-law by his side in the snow, Sturt bled to death over the course of the night. The incompetent, naive and gullible Elphinstone continued to believe that Akbar Khan was his &quot;ally&quot;, and believed his promise that he would send out the captured supplies if he stopped the retreat on 8 January. Adding to the misery of the British, that night a ferocious blizzard blew in, causing hundreds to freeze to death.
On 9 January 1842, Akbar sent out a messenger saying he was willing to take all of the British women as hostages, giving his word that they would not be harmed, and said that otherwise his tribesmen would show no mercy and kill all the women and children. One of the British officers sent to negotiate with Akbar heard him say to his tribesmen in Dari (Afghan Farsi) – a language spoken by many British officers – to &quot;spare&quot; the British while saying in Pashto, which most British officers did not speak, to &quot;slay them all&quot;. Lady Sale, her pregnant daughter Alexandria and the rest of British women and children accepted Akbar&#x27;s offer of safe conduct back to Kabul. As the East India Company would not pay a ransom for Indian women and children, Akbar refused to accept them, and so the Indian women and children died with the rest of the force in the Hindu Kush. The camp followers captured by the Afghans were stripped of all their clothing and left to freeze to death in the snow. Lady Sale wrote that as she was taken back to Kabul she noticed: &quot;The road was covered with awful mangled bodies, all naked&quot;.

In the early morning of 10 January, the column resumed its march, with everyone tired, hungry, and cold. Most of the sepoys by this time had lost a finger or two to frostbite, and could not fire their guns. At the narrow pass of Tunghee Tareekee, which was 50 yards long, and only 4 yards wide, the Ghizye tribesmen ambushed the column, killing without mercy all of the camp followers. The Anglo-Indian soldiers fought their way over the corpses of the camp followers with heavy losses to themselves. From a hill, Akbar Khan and his chiefs watched the slaughter while sitting on their horses, being apparently very much amused by the carnage. Captain Shelton and a few soldiers from the 44th regiment held the rear of the column and fought off successive Afghan attacks, despite being outnumbered. Johnson described Shelton as fighting like a &quot;bulldog&quot; with his sword, cutting down any Afghan who tried to take him on so efficiently that by the end of the day no Afghan would challenge him. On the evening of 11 January 1842, General Elphinstone, Captain Shelton, the paymaster Johnston, and Captain Skinner met with Akbar Khan to ask him to stop his attacks on the column. Akbar Khan provided them with warm tea and a fine meal before telling them that they were all now his hostages as he reckoned the East India Company would pay good ransoms for their freedom, and when Captain Skinner tried to resist, he was shot in the face. Command now fell to Brigadier Thomas Anquetil.

The evacuees were killed in huge numbers as they made their way down the of treacherous gorges and passes lying along the Kabul River between Kabul and Gandamak, and were massacred at the Gandamak pass before a survivor reached the besieged garrison at Jalalabad. At Gandamak, some 20 officers and 45 other ranks of the 44th Foot regiment, together with some artillerymen and sepoys, armed with some 20 muskets and two rounds of ammunition to every man, found themselves at dawn surrounded by Afghan tribesmen. The force had been reduced to fewer than forty men by a withdrawal from Kabul that had become, towards the end, a running battle through two feet of snow. The ground was frozen, the men had no shelter and had little food for weeks. Of the weapons remaining to the survivors at Gandamak, there were approximately a dozen working muskets, the officers&#x27; pistols, and a few swords. The British formed a square and defeated the first couple of the Afghan attacks, &quot;driving the Afghans several times down the hill&quot; before running out of ammunition. They then fought on with their bayonets and swords before being overwhelmed. The Afghans took only 9 prisoners and killed the rest. The remnants of the 44th were all killed except Captain James Souter, Sergeant Fair, and seven soldiers who were taken prisoner. The only soldier to reach Jalalabad was Dr. William Brydon and several sepoys over the following nights. Another source states that over one hundred British were taken prisoner. One British NCO fled from Gandamak to Gujrat India on foot according to a source cited from The Times of 2 March 1843 by Farrukh Husain who writes: &quot;The oddest account of escape from Gundamuck concerns that of a dark-skinned faqir who appeared in India in rags but was in fact a Scottish non commissioned officer who fled all the way to a British army Camp Deesa in Gujrat India, &quot;This morning a strange man came into camp, covered with hair, and almost naked his face burnt very much; he turned out to be Lance-Sergeant Philip Edwards of the Queen&#x27;s 44th Regiment who escaped the general slaughter at Gundamuch, Afghanistan, and after travelling 15 months in a southerly direction by the sun, he found his way into camp here, not knowing where he was.&quot;&quot;

Many of the women and children were taken captive by the Afghan warring tribes; some of these women married their captors, mostly Afghan and Indian camp followers who were wives of British officers. Children taken from the battlefield at the time who were later identified in the early part of the 20th century to be those of the fallen soldiers were brought up by Afghan families as their own children.

===Second British expedition===
At the same time as the attacks on the garrison at Kabul, Afghan forces beleaguered the other British contingents in Afghanistan. These were at Kandahar (where the largest British force in the country had been stationed), Jalalabad (held by a force which had been sent from Kabul in October 1841 as the first stage of a planned withdrawal) and Ghazni. Ghazni was stormed, but the other garrisons held out until relief forces arrived from India, in spring 1842. Akbar Khan was defeated near Jalalabad and plans were laid for the recapture of Kabul and the restoration of British control.

However, Lord Auckland had suffered a stroke and had been replaced as governor-general by Lord Ellenborough, who was under instructions to bring the war to an end following a change of government in Britain. Ellenborough ordered the forces at Kandahar and Jalalabad to leave Afghanistan after inflicting reprisals and securing the release of prisoners taken during the retreat from Kabul.

In August 1842 General William Nott advanced from Kandahar, capturing Ghazni and partially demolishing the city&#x27;s fortifications. Meanwhile, General George Pollock, who had taken command of a demoralized force in Peshawar used it to clear the Khyber Pass to arrive at Jalalabad, where General Sale had already lifted the siege. From Jalalabad, General Pollock inflicted a further crushing defeat on Akbar Khan. As the expedition advanced through Afghanistan, they bore witness to the countless dead comrades who perished following the retreat from Kabul. This enraged the British who took revenge on Afghan civilians by razing villages, murdering men and raping women. Neville Bowles Chamberlain described the killings as &quot;truly wicked.&quot; The combined British forces defeated all opposition before taking Kabul in September. A month later, having rescued the prisoners and demolished the city&#x27;s main bazaar as an act of revenge for the destruction of Elphinstone&#x27;s column, they withdrew from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Dost Muhammad was released and re-established his authority in Kabul. He died on 9 June 1863. During his lifetime no Russian mission was established in Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad is reported to have said:

I have been struck by the magnitude of your resources, your ships, your arsenals, but what I cannot understand is why the rulers of so vast and flourishing an empire should have gone across the Indus to deprive me of my poor and barren country.

==Aftermath==
Many voices in Britain, from Lord Aberdeen to Benjamin Disraeli, had criticized the war as rash and insensate. The perceived threat from Russia was vastly exaggerated, given the distances, the almost impassable mountain barriers, and logistical problems that an invasion would have to solve. In the three decades after the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Russians did advance steadily southward towards Afghanistan. In 1842, the Russian border was on the other side of the Aral Sea from Afghanistan. By 1865 Tashkent had been formally annexed, as was Samarkand three years later. A peace treaty in 1873 with Amir Alim Khan of the Manghit Dynasty, the ruler of Bukhara, virtually stripped him of his independence. Russian control then extended as far as the northern bank of the Amu Darya. The war would also be renowned as the &quot;greatest military humilation of the nineteenth century&quot; for the British.

In 1878, the British invaded again, beginning the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

Lady Butler&#x27;s famous painting of Dr. William Brydon, initially thought to be the sole survivor, gasping his way to the British outpost in Jalalabad, helped make Afghanistan&#x27;s reputation as a graveyard for foreign armies and became one of the great epics of empire.

In 1843, the British army chaplain, G.R. Gleig, wrote a memoir of the disastrous First Anglo-Afghan War, describing it as:
The Church of St. John the Evangelist located in Navy Nagar, Mumbai, India, more commonly known as the Afghan Church, was dedicated in 1852 as a memorial to the dead of the conflict.

==Financial cost of the war==
During the fiscal year of 1840—1841, the campaign in Afghanistan had cost over 1 million British pounds. Furthermore, half a million pounds were used towards the upkeep of garrisons in Sindh. The upkeep cost the Indian government heavily, drawing them into a deficit of over a million pounds, to which the government was borrowing loans heavily. This became increasingly unsustainable, and as a result, British forces in Afghanistan were ordered to be reduced to all but two regiments, with one being in stationed Kabul, and the other in Kandahar. Auckland intended to withdraw most troops by the next year, also informing Macnaghten that by 1842, spending had to be cut from 1 million pounds, to just 30,000.

==Battle honour==
The battle honour of &#x27;Afghanistan 1839&#x27; was awarded to all units of the presidency armies of the East India Company that had proceeded beyond the Bolan Pass, by gazette of the governor-general, dated 19 November 1839, the spelling changed from &#x27;Afghanistan&#x27; to &quot; by Gazette of India No. 1079 of 1916, and the date added in 1914. All the honours awarded for this war are considered to be non-repugnant. The units awarded this battle honour were:
* 4th Bengal Irregular Cavalry – 1st Horse
* 5th Madras Infantry
* Poona Auxiliary Horse – Poona Horse
* Bombay Sappers &amp; Miners – Bombay Engineer Group
* 31st Bengal Infantry
* 43rd Bengal Infantry
* 19th Bombay Infantry
* 1st Bombay Cavalry – 13th Lancers
* 2nd, 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry – mutinied in 1857
* 2nd, 3rd Companies of Bengal Sappers and Miners – mutinied in 1857
* 16th, 35th, 37th, 48th Bengal Infantry – mutinied in 1857
* 42nd Bengal Infantry (5th LI) – disbanded 1922

==Fictional depictions==
* It was depicted in an 1842 panorama in London. The exhibition was advertised as: &quot;a comprehensive and interesting VIEW OF CABUL, including every object of interest in the city, the Bala Hissar, the river Cabul, with a distant view of the Himalaya Mountains and the Pass of Khurd Cabul, where the British army were so treacherously destroyed. The whole illustrated by numerous groups of figures descriptive of the manngers of the Afghanese.&quot;
* The First Anglo-Afghan war is depicted in a work of historical fiction, &quot;Flashman&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser. (This is Fraser&#x27;s first &quot;Flashman&quot; novel.)
* The ordeal of Dr. Brydon may have inspired the story of Dr. John Watson in Conan Doyle‘s first Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, although his wound was suffered in the second war.
* Emma Drummond&#x27;s novel &quot;Beyond all Frontiers&quot; (1983) is based on these events, as are Philip Hensher&#x27;s &quot;Mulberry Empire&quot; (2002) and &quot;Fanfare&quot; (1993), by Andrew MacAllan, a distant relation of Dr William Brydon.
* G.A. Henty&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;To Herat and Kabul&quot; focuses on the Anglo-Afghan War through the perspective of a Scottish expatriate teenager named Angus. Theodor Fontane&#x27;s poem, &quot;Das Trauerspiel von Afghanistan&quot; (&quot;The Tragedy of Afghanistan&quot;) also refers to the massacre of Elphinstone’s army.
* &quot;Victoria&quot; (2017) episode &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter&quot; dramatizes Brydon&#x27;s survival in the retreat. In the show, Queen Victoria responds to the loss of life in the retreat with a speech at the launch of , and by privately meeting and honouring Brydon.

<text>Baron Milford is a title that has been created three times, once in the Peerage of Ireland and twice in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. All three creations have been for members of the same family. The first creation came in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776 when Sir Richard Philipps, 7th Baronet, of Picton Castle was made Baron Milford (there was no territorial designation). However, this title became extinct on his death in 1823, while the baronetcy was passed on to a distant relative (see the Viscount St Davids). The title was revived in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1847 when Sir Richard Philipps, 1st Baronet, of Picton Castle was created Baron Milford, of Picton Castle in the County of Pembroke. Born Richard Bulkeley Philipps Grant, he was the son of John Grant and Mary Philippa Artemisia, daughter of James Child and Mary Philippa Artemisia, daughter of Bulkeley Philipps, uncle of the first Baron of the first creation. He succeeded to the Philipps estates in 1823 and assumed the surname of Philipps the same year. In 1828 he was created a Baronet, of Picton Castle in the County of Pembroke, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. However, Lord Milford was childless and the titles became extinct on his death in 1857. He devised his estates to his half-brother Reverend James Henry Alexander Gwyther, who assumed the surname of Philipps. James&#x27;s daughter Mary Philippa married Charles Edward Gregg Fisher, who assumed the surname of Philipps and was created a Baronet, of Picton, in 1887 (see Philipps Baronets).

The title was revived for a second time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1939, when Sir Laurence Philipps, 1st Baronet, was made Baron Milford, of Llanstephan in the County of Radnor. He had already been created a Baronet, of Llanstephan in the County of Radnor, in 1919. Philipps was the sixth son of Sir James Philipps, 12th Baronet, of Picton Castle, and the younger brother of John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids and Owen Philipps, 1st Baron Kylsant. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He became a Communist and was disinherited by his father. Lord Milford is the only member of the Communist Party of Great Britain to sit in the House of Lords. the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1999.

==Barons Milford; First creation (1776)==
*Richard Philipps, 1st Baron Milford (1744–1823)

==Barons Milford; Second creation (1847)==
*Richard Bulkeley Philipps, 1st Baron Milford (1801–1857)

==Barons Milford; Third creation (1939)==
*Laurence Richard Philipps, 1st Baron Milford (1874–1962)

<doc id="510553" wikidata="Q333591" url="?curid=510553" title="Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett">
<text>Alfred Moritz Mond, 1st Baron Melchett, PC, FRS, DL (23 October 1868 – 27 December 1930), known as Sir Alfred Mond, Bt between 1910 and 1928, was a British industrialist, financier and politician. In his later life he became an active Zionist.

==Early life and education==
Mond was born in Farnworth, Widnes, Lancashire, England, the younger son of Ludwig Mond, a chemist and industrialist who had emigrated from Germany, and his wife Frieda, née Löwenthal, both of Jewish extraction. He was educated at Cheltenham College and St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, but failed his natural sciences tripos. He then studied law at the University of Edinburgh and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1894.

==Business career==
After his law studies, he joined his father&#x27;s business Brunner Mond &amp; Company as a director, later becoming its managing director. His other directorships included the Westminster Bank and the Industrial Finance Investment Corporation.

One of his major business achievements came in 1926, when he worked to create the merger of four companies to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), one of the world&#x27;s largest industrial corporations at the time. He became its first chairman.

Mond was also managing director of his father&#x27;s other company, the Mond Nickel Company, of which he inherited the majority of shares. He was an active director from the outset, and amongst other growth projects he commissioned the Coniston smelter and the Acton, London nickel carbonyl refinery. He saw the sense in Robert C. Stanley&#x27;s overture because of the Frood Mine problem, and recommended the merger of his company into the International Nickel Company, which was accomplished on 1 January 1929. Thereafter he sat as a director of the combined company.

==Political career==
Mond was also involved in politics and sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Chester from 1906 to 1910, for Swansea from 1910 to 1918 and for Swansea West from 1918 to 1923. He served in the coalition government of David Lloyd George as First Commissioner of Works from 1916 to 1921, and as Minister of Health (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1921 to 1922. After losing his seat at the 1923 general election, he returned to Parliament as a Liberal for Carmarthen at a by-election in August 1924, holding the seat until his elevation to the peerage in 1928. Although a supporter of the &quot;New Liberalism&quot; in his early political career and a &quot;vocal proponent of constructive social reform&quot; in the postwar government, Mond became a Conservative in January 1926 after falling out with Lloyd George over the former Prime Minister&#x27;s controversial plans to nationalise agricultural land.

Mond was created a Baronet, of Hartford Hill in Great Budworth in the County of Chester, in 1910, and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1913. In 1928 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Melchett, of Landford in the County of Southampton.

=== Mondism ===
In the aftermath of the 1926 General Strike, Mond led efforts to establish cooperation between workers (represented by trades unions and the General Council of the TUC) and the large employers; this short-lived initiative became known as .

==Benefactions, Zionism and honours==
Mond&#x27;s father had bequeathed a collection of old master paintings to the National Gallery, and Alfred provided housing for them in 1924. In 1929 he provided land in Chelsea for the Chelsea Health Society.

An enthusiastic Zionist, in 1920 Mond donated ten thousand pounds to Vladimir Jabotinsky. The following year he visited Palestine with Chaim Weizmann. He contributed money to the Jewish Colonization Corporation for Palestine and wrote for Zionist publications. He became President of the British Zionist Foundation and made financial contributions to Zionist causes. Melchett founded the town of Tel Mond, now in Israel. He also started building what is now one of the few private houses on the shore of the Sea of Galilee, now known as Villa Melchett. Tel Aviv and several other Israeli cities have a Melchett Street commemorating him.

One of Mond&#x27;s most enduring contributions to Zionism did not come through direct political means but through his enthusiastic and active support of Pinhas Rutenberg, to whom the British Government granted exclusive concessions to produce and distribute electricity in Palestine. Mond sat on the Board of the Palestine Electric Company and promoted the case of the company in London&#x27;s political and industrial circles.

Mond was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1928 and received a number of honorary degrees from Oxford, Paris and other universities.

==Personal life==
In 1894 Mond married Violet Goetze and they had one son, Henry Ludwig, and three daughters, Eva Violet, Mary Angela, and Norah Jena. Mond died in his London home in 1930, and his son succeeded in the barony.

==Literary references==
Mond is mentioned in T. S. Eliot&#x27;s 1920 poem &quot;A Cooking Egg&quot;. He is also – along with the Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Atatürk – widely considered to be the inspiration behind Mustapha Mond, one of the ten world controllers in Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

<text>Baron Moran, of Manton in the County of Wiltshire, is a title in the peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 8 March 1943 for the physician Charles Wilson (10 November 1882 – 12 April 1977). He is chiefly remembered as Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal physician during the Second World War and was president of the Royal College of Physicians from 1941 to 1949. His diary of his association with Churchill—that continued to Winston&#x27;s death in 1965—was published in 1966.

He was succeeded in 1977 by his eldest son, the second baron, a diplomat who notably served as British Ambassador to Hungary and Portugal and as British High Commissioner to Canada from 1981 to 1984. He was one of the 90 hereditary peers elected to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, where he sat as a crossbencher.

In 2014 the title passed to the latter&#x27;s son, James McMoran Wilson, the 3rd Baron Moran.

==Barons Moran (1943–)==

*Charles McMoran Wilson, 1st Baron Moran (1882–1977)
*(Richard) John McMoran Wilson, 2nd Baron Moran (1924–2014)
*James McMoran Wilson, 3rd Baron Moran (b. 1952)

The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son, Hon. David Andrew McMoran Wilson (b. 1990).

<doc id="510567" wikidata="Q369757" url="?curid=510567" title="Marvel 2099">
<text>Marvel 2099 was a Marvel Comics imprint, started in 1992, that was originally about one possible future of the Marvel Universe, but later revealed to be the Earth of the main Marvel continuity in the distant future. It was originally announced by Stan Lee in his &quot;Stan&#x27;s Soapbox&quot; column as a single series entitled &quot;The Marvel World of Tomorrow&quot;, which was being developed by Lee and John Byrne. This later changed to a line of books under the banner &quot;Marvel 2093&quot; (the date being one hundred years from the year in which the titles launched) before finally being published as &quot;Marvel 2099&quot;.

Three of the initial four titles launched—&quot;Doom 2099&quot;, &quot;Punisher 2099&quot;, and &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;—starred futuristic takes on pre-existing characters. The fourth, &quot;Ravage 2099&quot;, featured an all-new superhero, scripted for several months by Stan Lee. The 2099 line soon expanded to include &quot;2099 Unlimited&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four 2099&quot;, &quot;Ghost Rider 2099&quot;, &quot;Hulk 2099&quot;, &quot;X-Men 2099&quot;, and &quot;X-Nation 2099&quot;. While it has been confirmed to be a possible future version of Earth-616, the mainstream Marvel Universe, the 2099 universe has been officially designated as Earth-928 and alternatively dubbed as Earth-616 circa 2099, or simply Earth-2099.

==Publication history==
The initial universe began with &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;, &quot;Ravage 2099&quot;, &quot;Doom 2099&quot;, and &quot;Punisher 2099&quot; being launched in subsequent months. Peter David wrote &quot;Spider-Man&quot; for the bulk of the series, and it was consistently the most popular series. It satirized corporations, with Spider-Man constantly clashing with Alchemax, which employed him in his secret identity. Stan Lee wrote the first eight issues of &quot;Ravage&quot; as an extremely political story about corruption, corporate pollution, and the environment. After Lee left, he was replaced by a series of writers. In 1993, &quot;Wizard&quot; reported that the 2099 line had &quot;gone over fairly well with the fans&quot;.

===Growth and decline===
Fans requested further titles, and Marvel provided &quot;X-Men 2099&quot;. They also introduced a Hulk 2099 in the series &quot;2099 Unlimited&quot;, which featured occasional Spider-Man 2099 stories, as well as early work by Warren Ellis. The comics had a strong degree of interconnectivity that was similar to comics published by Marvel in the 1960s due to the imprint&#x27;s editor Joey Cavalieri. The only cross-title crossover within the 2099 universe, &quot;The Fall of the Hammer&quot;, detailed a plot by the corporations to technologically recreate the Norse pantheon, along with a new Thor, to distract attention from the anti-corporate superheroes.

The 2099 series expanded to include &quot;Ghost Rider 2099&quot;, about a hero whose consciousness had been downloaded into a robotic body. Hulk 2099 was also given a brief chance at his own series. As sales began to flag on all titles besides &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;, Marvel commissioned ideas from various writers, including a proposal by Grant Morrison and Mark Millar, before accepting Warren Ellis&#x27;s idea that Doom 2099, revealed to be, in fact, Victor Von Doom, would take over the United States. Each title had the modifier &quot;A.D.&quot; (&quot;After Doom&quot;) added on the logo to reflect the change. The new storyline allowed Marvel to cancel several low-selling titles (&quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Ravage&quot;, and &quot;The Punisher&quot;). The in-universe reason for the heroes&#x27; deaths was President Rogers (an impostor Captain America who was instated after Doom was violently ousted from office) ordered the execution of the super heroes, including Punisher, Hulk and a handful of low-tier heroes who had appeared in &quot;2099 Unlimited&quot;.

In 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest. With the line floundering, two additional titles were launched: &quot;X-Nation 2099&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;X-Men 2099&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Four 2099&quot;, which featured characters who were apparently the present day Fantastic Four accidentally sent into the future.

Around this time, &quot;Doom 2099&quot; became the only 2099 comic to crossover with a present-day Marvel comic when he traveled back to 1996 and met Daredevil, the Fantastic Four, and Namor in a story partially told in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #413. Spider-Man 2099 met the original Spider-Man in a special one-shot issue, making them the only characters to meet their counterparts.

===End of the imprint===

After sales slumped, the 2099 titles were canceled and replaced by &quot;2099: World of Tomorrow&quot;, a single title featuring the surviving characters from all the titles. The series lasted only eight issues before being canceled.

The 2099 line was concluded with a one-shot, &quot;2099: Manifest Destiny&quot; (March 1998), in which Captain America was found in suspended animation and, with Miguel O&#x27;Hara, assembled various 2099 heroes into a new team of Avengers. The story summarized the years from 2099 to 3099, with humanity transforming the corporate world of 2099 into a utopia and then expanding into space.

===Subsequent appearances===
The 2099 world has been seen occasionally since, most notably in Peter David&#x27;s &quot;Future Tense&quot; storyline in &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, which revisited both Spider-Man 2099 and the alternate future of the Maestro that David created in &quot;The Incredible Hulk: Future Imperfect&quot;, explaining a plot point which had been left dangling since David had abruptly left &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;.

In 2004, writer Robert Kirkman wrote a series of one-shot comics for the fifth anniversary of the Marvel Knights imprint, under the heading &quot;Marvel Knights 2099&quot;. The future portrayed in this series is unconnected to the original 2099 Universe, which included a different Punisher 2099.

In 2005, the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; one-shot designated the Earth of 2099 as Earth-928, with &quot;Marvel Knights 2099&quot; designated as Earth-2992. A cover of a second printing from the Spider-Man storyline &quot;The Other: Evolve or Die&quot; features Miguel O&#x27;Hara / Spider-Man 2099.

In 2006, the Exiles visited the Marvel Universe 2099 in &quot;Exiles&quot; #75-76 as part of the &quot;World Tour&quot; arc. This future split from the mainstream 2099 fairly early, as Doom 2099 had not yet met Spider-Man 2099. Spider-Man 2099 joined the Exiles and left with them.

In 2009 Marvel published miniseries &quot;Timestorm 2009–2099&quot;, crossing the current Marvel Universe with yet another alternate version of 2099. The Spider-Man 2099 of this reality is a teenager.

In 2013, Spider-Man 2099 became trapped in the mainstream Marvel Universe in &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot;. In 2014 he would star in an ongoing series and become involved in the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; storyline, along with numerous other alternate reality Spider-Men. Notably the Spider-Men 2099s of the &quot;Exiles&quot; and &quot;Timestorm 2009–2099&quot; series are killed during this event. At the end of this storyline, the 2099 timeline has been altered.

The 2099 universe is involved in the 2015 storyline &quot;Secret Wars&quot;.

In 2016, a storyline in &quot;Deadpool&quot; debuted the 2099 versions of Deadpool, a moniker shared by Wade&#x27;s daughters, Warda Wilson (his daughter with Shiklah) and Ellie Camacho. The storyline also reveals that Wade Wilson and Iron Fist are still alive in this time period, as they work with Ellie and Wade&#x27;s ally Emily Preston to stop Warda&#x27;s war on the city as she attempts to find out what happened to her mother.

In 2019 in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #25, Dr. Connors is giving a lecture on the negligence of the world and environment due to focus on the countless occurrences of superhero activity will end up negatively impacting the future, to the point of catastrophe. Meanwhile, set to his lecture, strange weather phenomenon is occurring above a burning oil rig. A rift opens in the sky and a figure falls out of it, landing on the dock of the rig. The workers un-bury the figure, revealing an unconscious Spider-Man 2099. There was later a series of one-shots to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Marvel 2099. It incorporated the ongoing storyline from &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; that not only reintroduced Spider-Man 2099, Fantastic Four 2099, Doom 2099, Punisher 2099, and Venom 2099 in individual one-shot issues, but also introduced Conan 2099. Ulana the Watcher narrated that this reality of Earth-2099 is a combination of Earth-928 and the other Marvel 2099 realities which have been rewoven together.

==Setting==
The world of 2099 is a cyberpunk dystopia (similar to the world of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;). North America is a corporate police state ruled by a few huge megacorporations, most notably Alchemax, which owns the private police force the Public Eye (which primarily punishes criminals&#x27; bank accounts). There were, prior to the launch of the comics, no active superheroes in this world, and the previous heroes are mythologized through religion, as with the Church of Thor. The present-day Marvel continuity is referred to as an &quot;Age of Heroes&quot; that abruptly ended in a catastrophe a century before that also set back society (this catastrophe was averted in the present when Miguel O&#x27;Hara—Spider-Man 2099—temporarily swapped places with his past self shortly before the cataclysm, turning Miguel&#x27;s world into an alternate future of the Marvel Universe rather than &quot;the&quot; future).

===Card system===
In the 2099 Universe, the monetary currency system uses implants commonly known as cards, which are credit ID implants. There are aluminum cards, gold cards, and platinum cards. Another type of card are black cards, which give the owner unlimited funds and law immunity.

There is also a status known as &quot;decred&quot;, which denies access to many public places, such as hospitals, hypermarkets, and shopping malls.

<doc id="510581" wikidata="Q866456" url="?curid=510581" title="R-parity">
<text>R-parity is a concept in particle physics. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, baryon number and lepton number are no longer conserved by all of the renormalizable couplings in the theory. Since baryon number and lepton number conservation have been tested very precisely, these couplings need to be very small in order not to be in conflict with experimental data. R-parity is a formula_1 symmetry acting on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) fields that forbids these couplings and can be defined as 
:formula_2

or, equivalently, as
:formula_3

where is spin, is baryon number, and is lepton number. All Standard Model particles have R-parity of +1 while supersymmetric particles have R-parity of −1.

Note that there are different forms of parity with different effects and principles, one should not confuse this parity with any other parity.

==Dark matter candidate==
With R-parity being preserved, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) cannot decay. This lightest particle (if it exists) may therefore account for the observed missing mass of the universe that is generally called dark matter. In order to fit observations, it is assumed that this particle has a mass of to , is neutral and only interacts through weak interactions and gravitational interactions. It is often called a weakly interacting massive particle or WIMP.

Typically the dark matter candidate of the MSSM is a mixture of the electroweak gauginos and Higgsinos and is called a neutralino. In extensions to the MSSM it is possible to have a sneutrino be the dark matter candidate. Another possibility is the gravitino, which only interacts via gravitational interactions and does not require strict R-parity.

==R-parity violating couplings of the MSSM==
The renormalizable R-parity violating couplings of the MSSM are
* formula_4 violates by 1 unit
The strongest constraint involving this coupling alone is from the non-observation of neutron–antineutron oscillations.

* formula_5 violates by 1 unit
The strongest constraint involving this coupling alone is the violation universality of Fermi constant formula_6 in quark and leptonic charged current decays.

* formula_7 violates by 1 unit
The strongest constraint involving this coupling alone is the violation universality of Fermi constant in leptonic charged current decays.

* formula_8 violates by 1 unit
The strongest constraint involving this coupling alone is that it leads to a large neutrino mass.

While the constraints on single couplings are reasonably strong, if multiple couplings are combined together, they lead to proton decay. Thus there are further maximal bounds on values of the couplings from maximal bounds on proton decay rate.

==Proton decay==

Without baryon and lepton number being conserved and taking formula_9 couplings for the R-parity violating couplings, the proton can decay in approximately 10−2 seconds or if minimal flavor violation is assumed the proton lifetime can be extended to 1 year. Since the proton lifetime is observed to be greater than 1033 to 1034 years (depending on the exact decay channel), this would highly disfavour the model. R-parity sets all of the renormalizable baryon and lepton number violating couplings to zero and the proton is stable at the renormalizable level and the lifetime of the proton is increased to 1032 years and is nearly consistent with current observational data.

Because proton decay involves violating both lepton and baryon number simultaneously, no single renormalizable R-parity violating coupling leads to proton decay. This has motivated the study of R-parity violation where only one set of the R-parity violating couplings are non-zero which is sometimes called the single coupling dominance hypothesis.

==Possible origins of R-parity==
A very attractive way to motivate R-parity is with a continuous gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken at a scale inaccessible to current experiments. A continuous formula_10 forbids renormalizable terms which violate and . If formula_10 is only broken by scalar vacuum expectation values (or other order parameters) that carry even integer values of , then there exist an exactly conserved discrete remnant subgroup which has the desired properties. The crucial issue is to determine whether the sneutrino (the supersymmetric partner of neutrino), which is odd under R-parity, develops a vacuum expectation value. It can be shown, on phenomenological grounds, that this cannot happen in any theory where formula_10 is broken at a scale much above the electroweak one. This is true in any theory based on a large-scale seesaw mechanism. As a consequence, in such theories R-parity remains exact at all energies.

This phenomenon can arise as an automatic symmetry in SO(10) grand unified theories. This natural occurrence of R-parity is possible because in SO(10) the Standard Model fermions arise from the 16 dimensional spinor representation, while the Higgs arises from a 10 dimensional vector representation. In order to make an SO(10) invariant coupling, one must have an even number of spinor fields (i.e. there is a spinor parity). After GUT symmetry breaking, this spinor parity descends into R-parity so long as no spinor fields were used to break the GUT symmetry. Explicit examples of such SO(10) theories have been constructed.

<doc id="510585" wikidata="Q522246" url="?curid=510585" title="Yoshiro Nakamatsu">
<text>, also known as , is a Japanese inventor. He regularly appears on Japanese talk shows demonstrating his inventions.

==Creative process==
In some interviews, Nakamatsu has described his &quot;creativity process&quot;, which includes listening to music and concludes with diving underwater, where he says he comes up with his best ideas. He then records them while underwater. Nakamatsu claims to benefit from lack of oxygen to the brain during his dives, making inventions &quot;0.05 seconds before death.&quot; He also claims that his &quot;Calm Room,&quot; a bathroom constructed without nails and tiled in 24-karat gold, encourages creative thinking by blocking television and radio waves. He also has an elevator in his house that he claims helps him think better, although he strictly denies that it is an elevator and describes it as a &quot;vertical moving room&quot;. He predicts that he will live until the age of 144.

==Inventions==
Nakamatsu is a prolific inventor, and he even claims to hold the world record for number of more than 3,200 inventions. While his claim to a &quot;world record&quot; has been described as a record for patents by several media articles, several other sources do not list Nakamatsu among the world&#x27;s most prolific inventors (he has six patent families).

Among Nakamatsu&#x27;s early inventions is the Shoyu Churu Churu, a siphon pump used in the home to move soy sauce from large containers to smaller vessels for cooking and serving. His patented inventions include:
*Juusyoku Record (, ) – An optical sound media which uses printed paper sheet instead of transparent film (1952) 
* &quot;Magnetic record sheet&quot; - &quot;a method for forming signal record track comprising a number of spiral signal track loops ...&quot; (1964)
* &quot;Enerex&quot; - System for generating hydrogen and oxygen
* &quot;PyonPyon&quot; - Jumping shoes with leaf springs on their soles
* &quot;Cerebrex&quot; armchair, a chair that supposedly improves mental function such as calculation and thinking by cooling the head and heating the feet
* A toilet seat lifter
* A condom with an embedded magnet, supposedly &quot;improving sensitivity&quot; as &quot;electricity is generated in the blood vessels in the female organs by Fleming&#x27;s left-hand rule&quot;
* A protective envelope for floppy disk (1975-1983), and a head-cleaning floppy disk (1981-1988)
* A CD for supposedly &quot;enhancing brightness or sexual function&quot;
* A cigarette-like device for supposedly &quot;activating the brain&quot;
* A pillow preventing falling asleep while driving (an air compressor strapped to the cars headrest, forcibly feeding air to the driver)
* A peephole in a sheet of material, described as a &quot;oneway visible shielding object&quot;
* Spectacles in the shape of eyes, so that the user appears to wear no spectacles
* A &quot;wig for self defense&quot; — a strip and a weight are attached to a wig. The wearer swings the wig to hit an attacker.
* Love Jet - A sexual enhancement product which he created out of concern about Japan&#x27;s declining birthrate. In a 1995 interview, he explained that the purpose of the aphrodisiac was &quot;to save Japan&quot;.

===Floppy disk=== 

Upon the basis of the Juusyoku Record patent issued in 1952, Nakamatsu claims to have invented the first floppy disk well before IBM&#x27;s floppy disk patent was filed in 1969. However, what Nakamatsu patented in 1952 was a paper for optical sound player. In contrast to a floppy disk, this Nakamatsu patent discloses the use of printed paper for storage instead of the magnetic material of a floppy disk. It is not rewritable and lacks most elements of the IBM floppy disk patent. Since the paper was &#x27;floppy&#x27; material, he claims he had invented the floppy disk (sometimes he uses the phrase &quot;floppy media&quot;); however, flexible magnetic recording media was well known prior to 1952, in tape and wire recording.

According to Nakamatsu, IBM reached licensing agreements with him in the late 1970s. He also says to have licensed his floppy disk to IBM in 1979, but that the details are &quot;confidential&quot;. An IBM spokesman, Mac Jeffery, confirmed that the company did license some of his patents, but said that they were not for the floppy disk, which he said IBM invented on its own. Another IBM spokesman, Brian Doyle, said that the company licensed 14 patents from Nakamatsu and those patents do not have anything to do with the floppy disk.

==Personal life==
Nakamatsu is the son of Hajime Nakamatsu, a banker, and Yoshino Nakamatsu, a teacher who provided early tutoring in mathematics and science and encouraged him to begin inventing. He studied engineering at the University of Tokyo. He has three children.

In June 2014, Nakamatsu, who has contended that it should be possible for people to reach 144 years of age by taking care of their health, revealed that he is suffering from prostate cancer and that his doctors did not expect him to live past the end of 2015. He has sought a new treatment for the disease. In September 2015, Nakamatsu appeared at the awards ceremony for the Ig Nobel prizes, where he performed a song about his medical condition.

==Political aspirations==
Nakamatsu is a perennial political candidate. In 2004 he told the &quot;Japan Times&quot; that &quot;politics is a part of inventions,&quot; explaining that it is an &quot;invisible invention&quot; along the lines of concepts such as education and happiness. Since 1995 he has unsuccessfully campaigned multiple times to be elected Governor of Tokyo, including, at an age of 96 years, in the 2024 election where he was ranked 11th. He has also campaigned unsuccessfully for election to the House of Councillors, the upper house of the National Diet. In 2010 and 2013 he ran as a candidate of the Happiness Realization Party.

==Media coverage and recognition==
Nakamatsu has appeared on several American TV shows, including &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Make, Create, Innovate&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot;. He also appeared on the BBC show &quot;Adam and Joe Go Tokyo&quot; and the BBC radio show &quot;Jon Ronson On...&quot; In 2005, Nakamatsu was awarded the Ig Nobel Prize (a parody of the Nobel Prize) for Nutrition, for photographing every meal he has consumed during a period of 34 years. In 2009, Danish filmmaker Kaspar Astrup Schröder made a humorous documentary about Nakamatsu titled &quot;The Invention of Dr. NakaMats&quot;. In 2010, Nakamatsu claimed he had been granted an honorary title by the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, and introduces himself as &quot;Sir Dr. NakaMats&quot;, although his claim has been denied by a representative of the order.

In 2013, Nakamatsu was featured on the Sky 1 programme &quot;The Moaning of Life&quot;, where Karl Pilkington travels the world to see how people face up to life&#x27;s biggest issues. In 2015, Full Metal Breakfast released a song called &quot;Dr. NakaMats.&quot; in 2016, Nakamatsu was awarded the first Museum Lifetime Visionary Award &quot;in recognition of a uniquely decorated life dedicated to the pursuit of that which we do not yet know&quot; during a celebration of his 88th birthday. The ceremony, held in Cortlandt Alley in New York City, was planned in conjunction with the museum&#x27;s exhibition of various inventions and personal artifacts of Nakamatsu.

In 2019, Nakamatsu was featured in a mini-documentary by popular YouTube channel Great Big Story, in which Nakamatsu discussed some of his successful inventions and demonstrated his creative process. , it had more than 4.2 million views.

<doc id="510588" wikidata="Q6315486" url="?curid=510588" title="Jury rigging">
<text>In maritime transport and sailing, jury rigging or jury-rigging is making temporary makeshift running repairs with only the tools and materials on board. It originates from sail-powered boats and ships. Jury-rigging can be applied to any part of a ship; be it its super-structure (hull, decks), propulsion systems (mast, sails, rigging, engine, transmission, propeller), or controls (helm, rudder, centreboard, daggerboards, rigging).

Similarly, a jury mast is a replacement mast after a dismasting. If necessary, a yard would also be fashioned and stayed to allow a watercraft to resume making way.

==Rigging==

A sail-powered boat may carry a limited amount of repair materials, from which some form of jury-rig can be fashioned. Additionally, anything salvageable, such as a spar or spinnaker pole, could be adapted to carry a makeshift sail.

Ships typically carried a selection of spare parts such as topmasts. However, due to their much larger size, at up to in diameter, the lower masts were too large to carry as spares. Example jury-rig configurations include:
*A spare topmast
*The main boom of a brig
*Replacing the foremast with the mizzenmast (mentioned in William N. Brady&#x27;s &quot;The Kedge Anchor, or Young Sailors&#x27; Assistant&quot;, 1852)
*The bowsprit set upright and tied to the stump of the original mast.

The jury mast knot may provide anchor points for securing makeshift stays and shrouds to support a jury mast, although there is differing evidence of the knot&#x27;s actual historical use.

Jury-rigs are not limited to sail-powered boats. Any unpowered watercraft can carry jury sail. A rudder, tiller, or any other component can be jury-rigged by improvising a repair out of materials at hand.

==Similar terms==
*&quot;Jerry-built&quot; things, which are things &#x27;built unsubstantially of bad materials&#x27;, has a separate unknown etymology. It is probably linked to earlier pejorative uses of the word &quot;jerry&quot;, attested as early as 1721, and may have been influenced by &quot;jury-rigged&quot;. The blended terms &quot;jerry rigging&quot; and &quot;jerry-rigged&quot; are also common.
*&quot;Afro engineering&quot; (short for &quot;African engineering&quot;) or &quot;nigger-rigging&quot; is a fix that is temporary, done quickly, technically improperly, or without attention to or care for detail. It can also be shoddy, second-rate workmanship, with whatever available materials. &quot;Nigger-rigging&quot; originated in the 1950s United States; the term was euphemized as &quot;afro engineering&quot; in the 1970s and later again as &quot;ghetto rigging&quot;. The terms have been used in the U.S. auto mechanic industry to describe quick makeshift repairs. These phrases have largely fallen out of common usage due to their colloquial nature, but are occasionally used within the African-American community.
* Another American expression is &quot;redneck technology&quot;.
*To &quot;MacGyver&quot; (or &quot;MacGyverize&quot;) something is to rig up something in a hurry using materials at hand, from the title character of the American television show of the same name, who specialized in such improvisation stunts.
*In New Zealand, having a &quot;Number 8 wire&quot; mentality means to have the ability to make or repair something using any materials at hand, such as standard farm fencing wire.
*In British slang, &quot;bodge&quot; and &quot;bodging&quot; refer to doing a job serviceably but inelegantly using whatever tools and materials are at hand; the term derives from bodging, for expedient woodturning using unseasoned, green wood (especially branches recently removed from a nearby tree).
*The chiefly English term &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; (&quot;DIY&quot;) relatedly refers to creating, repairing, or modifying things without professional or expert assistance.
*Similar concepts in other languages include: in Hindi and in Urdu, () in Japanese, in Genoese dialect, () in Chinese, in German, in Portuguese and in Brazilian Portuguese, in French, in Swahili. Several equivalent terms in South Africa are in Afrikaans, in Zulu, in Sotho, and in Tswana.

<text>Touched by an Angel is an American drama television series that premiered on CBS on September 21, 1994, and ran for 211 episodes over nine seasons until its conclusion on April 27, 2003. Created by John Masius and executive produced by Martha Williamson, the series stars Roma Downey as an angel named Monica, and Della Reese as her supervisor Tess. Throughout the series, Monica is tasked with bringing guidance and messages from God to various people who are at a crossroads in their lives. From season three onward, they are frequently joined by Andrew (John Dye), the Angel of Death (who first appeared as a recurring character in season two).

==Plot==
The episodes of the series generally revolved around the &quot;cases&quot; of Monica (Roma Downey), an angel recently promoted from the &quot;search and rescue&quot; division, who works under the guidance of Tess (Della Reese), a sarcastic boss who is sometimes hard on her junior colleague, but is more of a surrogate mother than a supervisor.

Monica in one episode outlines that she started in the choir, then annunciations, followed by search and rescue and then case work. Most cases involve a single person or a group of people who are at a crossroads in their lives and facing a large problem or tough decision. Monica and Tess bring them messages of hope from God and give them guidance to help make decisions. During their first episode, the pair receive a red 1972 Cadillac Eldorado convertible as a gift; they use it for transportation throughout the rest of the series while in the human world, with Tess doing the driving. As the series progresses, Monica continues gaining experience as a case worker and, during some cases must learn lessons of her own.

During the series pilot, an angel of death named Adam is introduced. In the season two premiere, &quot;Interview with an Angel&quot;, a new Angel of Death named Henry is introduced. Then in the season two episode entitled &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;, Andrew (played by John Dye) is introduced as the Angel of Death. Initially a recurring character, he becomes a main character in season three, making him the permanent Angel of Death for the remainder of the series. The original angel of death, Adam, continued to appear in guest appearances over the next few seasons.

In Season 4, a new angel is introduced named Rafael (Alexis Cruz), who appears throughout the series on a recurring basis, often assisting the main trio (Monica, Tess, and Andrew) in their cases. Rafael is a younger looking angel than the others and thus is occasionally involved in situations involving teenagers and young adults so they can relate to each other. Towards the end of the seventh season, a new angel, Gloria (Valerie Bertinelli), is created by God during one of Monica&#x27;s assignments, designed to adapt to life on Earth in the 21st century. She becomes a regular character for seasons eight and nine, as a trainee under Monica and Tess&#x27;s guidance.

In the series finale, Monica is up for promotion to supervisor, pending the outcome of a difficult case in which she must defend Zach (Scott Bairstow), an innocent drifter accused of causing a boiler explosion at a school two years ago in the small town of Ascension, Colorado. The explosion killed most of the children, leaving the citizens devastated. During the case, Monica sees many familiar faces, including Joey Machulis (Paul Wittenburg), one of Monica&#x27;s previous assignments who is a witness to the events, his brother Wayne (Randy Travis), who is now sheriff, Sophie (Marion Ross), a formerly homeless acquaintance, and Mike (Patrick Duffy), a lawyer Monica saved during her search and rescue days who is now the Mayor. An out of town developer claims Zach is the perpetrator and despite the lack of evidence, Zach is put on trial. Monica does all she can to help him, including asking Mike to represent him, but the prosecutor in the case, Jones, is really Satan in disguise, and Zach is eventually convicted.

After the trial, Monica is able to help the citizens realize their mistake and to see that Zach&#x27;s return to the town had helped them finally start living again. They begin going back to church, welcomed by the pastor they had once abandoned. Their change of heart, however, cannot free Zach, so Monica visits him in jail and reveals that she is an angel. She then promises him that she will become his guardian angel, forgoing all future assignments and the coveted promotion, to protect him from harm in prison. When she returns in the morning, however, the cell is empty. The citizens decide not to search for him, and it is revealed that Joey inadvertently caused the explosion after the devil tricked him into turning the boiler too high to warm some kittens he&#x27;d found.

The perplexed Monica returns to the desert to find Tess and Zach. There, she learns that Zach was actually God, and that her defending him was a test, which she passed by being willing to sacrifice herself for him. Monica is promoted to supervisor. As she leaves, she says her goodbyes to Gloria, and to Andrew, who gives her a pocket watch to remember their friendship. Before parting, Tess gives Monica the keys to the Cadillac, as she is leaving her job to sit at God&#x27;s feet. Monica is last shown driving away as the camera pans out over the desert.

==Production==
&quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; was produced by CBS and Moon Water Productions. The network had wanted to do a series about angels after reading a story in &quot;Newsweek&quot; about how belief in angels was becoming popular. Critic Harold Bloom, among others, noted a cultural awareness of angels around those years that began in 1990 with Sophy Burnham&#x27;s international bestseller &quot;A Book of Angels,&quot; and continued with Tony Kushner&#x27;s 1993 play Angels in America, among many other cultural touchstones.

Most episodes of the series were produced in Salt Lake City, Utah. According to &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Caryn James, John Masius created the first pilot episode for the series, but it was a darker, less hopeful story than the producers wanted. It cost the studio $2 million to produce the episode. Masius wrote the show as a reflection of his spiritual anger at the time due to his two children being born disabled. Martha Williamson was approached to be the series executive producer in early 1994. She described the pilot she received as &quot;upsetting&quot; as it &quot;portrayed angels as recycled dead people with power over life and death.&quot; She initially declined the position, but during a lunch with Andy Hill, then President of CBS, she mentioned the show and suggested he find a producer who would create a show with &quot;loving, joyful&quot; angels that the audience would have to believe in.

Williamson stated that she could not stop thinking about the show after that meeting, and eventually called to ask if the position was still open. Though getting the position was no longer a sure thing, she passed up a more lucrative position directing a court drama and went in for an interview with CBS in June 1994. During her interview, she states she emphasized that she was a Christian and could only do a show that depicted angels in a way she felt was true to her view of angels and that was respectful towards God. She also indicated that the pilot should be redone from the beginning, keeping only the characters Monica and Tess, reworked. The studio agreed with her remarks and hired her. Williamson herself wrote a new script for the pilot episode, while also working on hiring the remaining staff for the series, which was due to premiere in September. The pilot was filmed in Salt Lake City and the show was ready on schedule. The first episode aired on September 14, 1994.

===Theme song===
The lyrics to the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Walk with You&quot;, are sung at the beginning of each episode by Della Reese.

===Spin-off===
In 1996, &quot;Promised Land&quot; was launched as a spin-off series, following the Greene family whom Monica had met during one of her cases, as they travel the United States helping those in need. Four crossover episodes aired during &quot;Promised Land&quot;″s three-season run.

==Broadcast and syndication==
The series went into syndication in 1998, and has aired on PAX-TV, Hallmark Channel, CBS Drama, Up, MeTV and Start TV. It has also aired on Hallmark Drama.

==Home media==
Paramount Home Entertainment has released all nine seasons on DVD in Region 1. The DVDs released before 2006 used the main Paramount brand; starting with The Third Season, Volume 2, they use the CBS DVD brand. Seasons 1, 2, 5–9 were released as single season box sets, while seasons 3 &amp; 4 were released as two volume sets.

On February 9, 2016, CBS DVD released &quot;Touched by an Angel: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

==Reception==

===Critical===
Throughout its run, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; received negative reviews from critics, who derided its use of treacly melodrama. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;viewers with low tolerance for precious whimsy will probably find they have overdosed on pixie dust within the first 10 minutes.&quot; Michael Blowen of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote, &quot;If you loved Michael Landon&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Highway to Heaven&quot;&#x27;, a show pooh-poohed by the critics that became a huge hit, you&#x27;ll probably go for this sugary, maudlin, sentimental myth-making.&quot; David Zurawik of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; opined it was &quot;the worst new series of the TV season [...] there&#x27;s absolutely nothing divine about it.&quot; Commenting on frequent shots of Monica&#x27;s bare feet in the first episode, Zurawik wrote, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s all about unless CBS has research showing a large audience of foot fetishists waiting for a reason not to watch ABC&#x27;s &quot;Roseanne&quot;.&quot;

In a retrospective piece titled &quot;Mauled by an Angel&quot; for his column &quot;Religion Dispatches&quot;, W. Scott Poole stated that Downey and Reese &quot;served up a syrupy but powerful advertisement for a greeting-card brand of religious faith with little theological definition, but a healthy serving of &#x27;chicken soup for the soul&#x27; (a franchise that itself became popular in the same era).&quot; He added the show &quot;seemed to suggest that God was deeply concerned but mostly unable or unwilling to get directly involved, sending along his messengers to patch things up for humanity (or select portions of it) now and again.&quot; Writing of the first season, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the show a &quot;C&quot; grade, and said the show &quot;succeeds in being so unpretentiously, innocently pure-minded—this is the &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; of fall &#x27;94—that it&#x27;s possible to feel sympathy for its ratings plight.&quot; Common Sense Media reviewer Emily Ashby gave the series 3 out of 5 stars, and said that &quot;this uplifting, inspirational show is steeped in strong moral messages, life lessons, and Christian overtones that include multiple references to &#x27;God,&#x27; &#x27;Lord,&#x27; and the &#x27;Father.&#x27;&quot;

===Ratings===
&quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; became one of CBS&#x27;s highest-rated series during season three and continued through season six, when it was the ninth most watched network series, with 17,190,000 viewers that amounted to a 15% share of the market as determined by Nielsen Media Research. In season eight, after the series moved from its Sunday time slot to a Saturday one, it dropped to 79th place, with 8.3 million viewers.

===Awards===
The series was nominated for eleven Primetime Emmy Awards between 1997 and 2000, including two nominations each for Downey and Reese in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series categories, respectively. It was also nominated for three Golden Globe Awards, two in 1998 and 1999 for Downey for Best Performance by an Actress in a TV-Series - Drama, and one in 1998 for Reese for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series even though the series was never able to secure either award. Marc Lichtman was awarded five BMI Film and Television Awards for &quot;Television Music&quot; in 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001 for his work as the series composer.

===Email controversy===
In 1999, a chain email emerged that falsely claimed that atheism activist Madalyn Murray O&#x27;Hair (who died in 1995) was circulating a petition for the Federal Communications Commission to ban all religiously themed radio and television shows, including &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. The email claims the petition has the ID number 2493, and calls on readers to write to the FCC to express their objections to it. The hoax was modeled on a chain email from 1996, and variations persisted into the 2000s, with different programs mentioned and different individuals supposedly leading the effort. In reality, the referenced petition (RM 2493) sought to prevent religious organizations from receiving licenses to broadcast on educational channels, it did not demand a ban on all religious programming, O&#x27;Hair was not affiliated with it, and it was rejected by the FCC in 1975.

===In popular culture===
Maria Bamford imitated Monica on the track &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; on her &quot;Burning Tours&quot; album.

It was also spoofed on &quot;MadTV&quot; as &quot;Touched by an Atheist&quot; on an episode guest starring comedian George Carlin.

It was also spoofed on the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Ready, Willing and Disabled&quot;.

Weird Al Yankovic&#x27;s take on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, called &quot;Couch Potato&quot;, changed the title to &quot;Touched by an Uncle&quot;.

It was parodied in the &quot;Birdgirl&quot; episode &quot;Thirdgirl&quot;.

==In other media==
A book on the series, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, was published by Zondervan in November 1997. Written by Williams and Robin Sheets, it contains background information on some of the stories featured, series production information, basic details on the first fifty episodes and profiles of Downey, Reese and Dye. It also has short story versions of four episodes: &quot;Interview with an Angel&quot;, &quot;There, but for the Grace of God&quot;, &quot;An Unexpected Snow&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. A second book, &quot;In the Words of Angels: Twenty Inspiring Stories from Touched by an Angel&quot;, was published by Fireside Books on August 28, 2001. Also written by Williams, it collects twenty short stories based on episodes from the series.

An audio soundtrack, &quot;Touched by an Angel: The Album&quot;, was released on November 3, 1998.

<doc id="510603" wikidata="Q1343303" url="?curid=510603" title="Janes Fighting Ships">
<text>Janes Fighting Ships is an annual reference book of each country&#x27;s navy and coast guard, along with their weapons and aircraft. Included are ship names, construction data, size, speed, range, complement, engineering, armament, and sensors. This is generally followed by relevant commentary. Originally, it was illustrated with ink sketches done by founder, Fred T. Jane (1865–1916). It is his surname &quot;Jane&quot; that makes this title distinctive.

Jane was a struggling commercial artist and journalist with an interest in naval affairs. In the 1880s he set out to record all of the armored warships serving in the world&#x27;s navies. His plan was to publish this record with the title &quot;Ironclads of the World&quot;. Initially &quot;Brassey&#x27;s Naval Annual&quot; and various Royal Navy periodicals were the source of inspiration for his drawings. In later years he became acquainted with a collector of warship photographs, W.A. Bieber. This enabled Jane to complete nearly 500 drawings. The first edition was published in early 1898 as &quot;All The World&#x27;s Fighting Ships.&quot; It cost 10s. 6d. and was an immediate success. Jane&#x27;s book was the first naval almanac/encyclopedia to put the illustrations alongside the technical data, which simplified the reference. It also had a silhouette section that directed the user to ships that shared certain characteristics, such as the number of funnels, aiding in rapid identification of unfamiliar ships at sea.

Since the 1961–1962 edition, navies have been listed in alphabetical order. That had been the policy from 1898 to 1902. However, from 1903 to 1921, the principal navies were listed in order of strength, with the lesser navies following in geographic clusters. From 1922 to 1960–1961, the Royal Navy was listed first, followed by Dominion navies in alphabetical order, and then by the rest of the world. As the Dominions gained independence, they lobbied to be listed separately. As a result, the editors reverted to the 1898 order, conceding that it was more logical as well as handier for the user.

Warship types are listed in a subjective order of importance, which is generally related to size. An exception to this is the submarine, which is now highly regarded, despite tending to be smaller than many surface ships. Type designation is done by the individual navies. This is imperfect, and can be the subject of spirited discussion. Nevertheless, most types (for example: frigate) hold generally true. Ships built to the same general design (class) are listed together. Each class is listed in chronological order, from newest to oldest. The details are assembled by the editors, primarily using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT).

The Jane Naval War Game was produced in 1899 and advertised in that year&#x27;s edition.

The first photo appeared in the 1899 edition. From the 1900 edition, photographs would rapidly replace the sketches. Color photographs were introduced to the Forward with the 1990-91 edition. With the 1997-98 edition color photographs began to appear in individual country listings and soon predominated.

By the 1903 edition, the title on the spine was printed as &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships.&quot; In 1916 the title page followed suit. It was not until 1922 or 23 that the front cover did as well. The apostrophe in &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; was dropped in 2020.

The first two editions were published by Sampson Low (England), and Little Brown (United States). Sampson Low solely published the 1900–1940 editions. Wartime demand brought in Macmillan to publish a North American edition from 1941 to 1947–1948. McGraw Hill took over from Macmillan in publishing the North American edition through the 1973–1974 edition. Both Sampson Low and McGraw Hill ended their association with &quot;Jane&#x27;s&quot; when Jane&#x27;s Yearbooks, Franklin Watts, took over publishing with the 1974–1975 edition. That iteration was succeeded by Jane&#x27;s Publishing Company in 1980–1981, and then by Jane&#x27;s Information Group with the 1990–1991 edition. JIG was acquired by IHS in 2007. IHS was merged with Markit to form IHS Markit Ltd in 2016. In turn, they were acquired by S&amp;P Global in 2022.

Jane&#x27;s has been published every year since 1898, with the exception of the 1940s, when only eight of ten years saw new editions. There were a number of contributing factors to this gap. Vast wartime construction programs were difficult to verify. Extensive modifications were made to warships, again, difficult to verify under wartime conditions. Ships were also sunk or destroyed, a vexing complication. At the end of the war, demobilization and redistribution of naval assets was rapid and complex. After 1942, editions were published with paired, hyphenated years, beginning with 1943-44. This essentially skipped the 1943 edition, as it was published in 1944. The 1944-45 edition was published in 1946, meaning that no edition was actually published in 1945. There was no 1945-46 edition. The 1946-47 edition was published in 1947. with succeeding editions arriving every year to the present, 2024–2025.

The publication&#x27;s success launched many popular, military and commercial reference titles that carry the name &quot;Janes&quot;. As of 2024, IHS Markit has 35 such titles in print. In the past, Sampson Low, Jane&#x27;s Yearbooks, Jane&#x27;s Publishing and JIG have published dozens of similar titles.

Vintage editions of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; are considered collectable. Those published before World War Two are uncommon, while volumes published prior to World War One are scarce.

Ten early editions of Jane&#x27;s (those of 1898, 1905–06, 1906–07, 1914, 1919, 1924, 1931, 1939, 1944–45, and 1950–51) were reissued in facsimile reprints by Arco Publishing starting in 1969. All of these appeared in the landscape format that characterized the series until the 1956-57 edition, while from 1957-58 the present portrait layout was adopted, thus matching the sister Jane&#x27;s publication on aircraft.

In 1996, &quot;Janes&quot; became available on CD-ROM and other forms of electronic delivery.

<text>Working Title Films Limited, formerly Visionensure Limited and Working Title Limited, is a British film and television production company that is a subsidiary of Universal Pictures, a division of NBCUniversal, which is itself a division of Comcast. The company was founded by Tim Bevan and Sarah Radclyffe in 1983. Bevan and Eric Fellner are now the co-chairmen of the company.

==Company history==
Bevan and Radclyffe were partners in pop music promotional company, Aldabra, and set up Working Title Films in London in 1983 where they were commissioned by newly created UK broadcaster, Channel 4, to make a television film, &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot; (1985), directed by Stephen Frears. &quot;My Beautiful Launderette&quot; was a success at the Edinburgh Film Festival and received a theatrical release, where it was successful internationally. Accountant Graham Bradstreet joined as a third partner in 1986.

&quot;A World Apart&quot; was entered in competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and won the Special Grand Prize of the Jury. &quot;The Tall Guy&quot; (1988) saw the feature film debut of screenwriter Richard Curtis and director Mel Smith.

In 1988, Michael Kuhn of PolyGram started to work with the company and in 1989 PolyGram acquired 49% of the company and they jointly launched Manifesto Film Sales. Manifesto&#x27;s first third-party pick up for distribution was the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Barton Fink&quot; (1991). Bradstreet left the company in 1990 and Radclyffe a year later, with Eric Fellner, a fellow independent film producer, joining the company in 1991. The same year, Kuhn set up PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which acquired 100% of Working Title in 1992. The company produced a variety of films for PolyGram Filmed Entertainment which became a major Hollywood competitor.

Paul Webster set up an office in Los Angeles in 1991 and producer Liza Chasin was appointed as president of production. Webster produced the company&#x27;s first American films, &quot;Rubin &amp; Ed&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot;. Working Title also made Tim Robbins&#x27; directorial debut, &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; (1992).

The company was incorporated and registered as a private limited company in the UK on 14 October 1992, as Visionensure Limited. On 18 December 1992 its name was changed to Working Title Limited, before rebranding as Working Title Films Limited on 20 February 1995.

Gramercy Pictures began distributing the company&#x27;s films in the United States, starting with &quot;Posse&quot; (1993). In 1994, the company&#x27;s &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;, written by Curtis, became the highest-grossing British film of all-time with a gross of $245 million. They also made the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot; (1994). In 1996, Robbins&#x27; &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; was the company&#x27;s first film to win an Academy Award, with Susan Sarandon winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. The Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996) won two Academy Awards the following year. The company had another major success with &quot;Bean&quot; (1997) directed by Smith and co-written by Curtis, grossing $251 million.

In 1998, PolyGram was sold to the Seagram company and merged with MCA Music Entertainment, to form Universal Music Group. PolyGram Films was folded into Universal Pictures. In 1999, Seagram sold the bulk of its library of PolyGram films released up until 31 March 1996 to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 1999 also saw the company&#x27;s highest-grossing film to date with &quot;Notting Hill&quot;, again written by Curtis, with a gross of $364 million.

Around 2003, New Zealand-born producer Tim White was appointed head of the Australian branch of Working Title Films, and during this time executive produced Gregor Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;. 

Although contractually allowed to produce any film with a budget of up to $35 million, on a practical basis, Bevan and Fellner consult with studio executives at Working Title&#x27;s parent company NBCUniversal. Working Title company renewed its first look deal with Universal Pictures in 2020.

===WT2 Productions===
In 1999, Bevan and Fellner launched a subsidiary company named Working Title 2 Productions, commonly known as WT2. The company is an independent film production arm run by Natascha Wharton, and has produced films that include &quot;Billy Elliot&quot;, &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; and &quot;The Calcium Kid&quot;.

==Television division==
Working Title has been active in television production since the beginning of the 1990s. In February 2010, Working Title officially launched its television division as a joint venture with parent company NBCUniversal, itself owned by Comcast. Since then, they have produced content for both British and American television. Notable productions and co productions developed by Working Title Television (WTTV) include NBC&#x27;s &quot;About a Boy&quot;, and Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Tudors&quot;.

WTTV has offices in London and Los Angeles.

===TV productions===
==1991 ITV franchise bid==
In 1991, Working Title was involved in a bid for the London Weekend ITV licence. Working Title, Mentorn, Palace and PolyGram wanted to take over from London Weekend Television and broadcast to London under the name London Independent Broadcasting. In the event LWT retained its licence; London Independent Broadcasting&#x27;s proposals were deemed by the Independent Television Commission, which was overseeing the bid process, to fail the quality threshold.

<text>The or RAA, was the largest of the organizations established by Japanese authorities to provide organized prostitution to prevent rapes and sexual violence by Allied occupation troops on the general population, and to create other leisure facilities for occupying Allied troops immediately following World War II. The RAA recruited 55,000 women and was short-lived.

==Background==
On August 21, 1945, Japanese authorities decided to set up a RAA for the benefit of Allied occupation troops. In fact at that time, the Home Ministry had already sent a directive to prefectural governors and police chiefs on August 18 ordering them to make preparations for &quot;comfort facilities&quot; in areas that the Allied occupation troops would be stationed. These facilities (which included dance halls, restaurants, and bars in addition to brothels) were intended to be staffed by women already involved in the &quot;water trade&quot;. However, because there were not enough women in the &quot;water trade&quot; and there were an abundance of women facing food scarcity, recruitment was broadened with newspaper ads that obscured the nature of the work while promising food, clothing, and shelter. Government officials used patriotic language in describing the comfort facility system, extolling the women who sacrifice themselves to be &quot;patriotic dikes&quot; preventing sexual violence against Japanese women and girls. 

Japanese authorities set up the brothels with the intent of reducing the amount of sexual violence committed by the incoming Allied occupation troops.

Some 50,000 women, most of them as prostitutes, worked for the RAA. The first brothel, named &quot;Komachien Garden&quot; and employing 150 women, was opened on September 20, 1945. RAA brothels were placed off limits in March 1946, after just seven months of operation, to stop the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases, and closed down shortly thereafter.

According to Tanaka Yuki, General Ishii Shirō&#x27;s mistress recruited Japanese females as prostitutes for the Recreation and Amusement Association where up to 70,000 Japanese females were forced to serve US soldiers in brothels. However figures given by Tanaka Yuki had been disputed by Brian Walsh.

==Establishment==

Although arrangements in most of the country were left to local officials and police departments, in the case of the Tokyo area, which was to host the largest number of foreign troops, a different approach was taken. Nobuya Saka, Superintendent-General of the Metropolitan Police Headquarters, met with Hamajirō Miyazawa and Genjirō Nomoto, the heads of the , and asked them to help make arrangements for the soon to arrive troops. Miyazawa and Nomoto used their connections to gather together a group of representatives of the nightclub, bar, and brothel industries. These representatives then met with the police on the 21st where they were formally asked to establish &quot;comfort facilities&quot;, but to conceal the government&#x27;s role as much as possible. On August 23, these men formed the &quot;Special Comfort Facilities Association&quot; (renamed the Recreation and Amusement Association shortly later). 

The RAA utilized the patriotic language of the war years in its operations, stressing the &quot;selfless&quot; nature of its employees. At the inauguration of the RAA (which was attended by bureaucrats and police officials), an &quot;oath&quot; was read:

The &quot;Okichi&quot; referenced was the possibly legendary maid of Townsend Harris, the first American consul in Japan from 1856 to 1861, who was pressured into becoming his consort.

The organization was funded through unsecured loans from the arranged by Hayato Ikeda, director of the Ministry of Finance&#x27;s Tax Bureau. 33 million yen were loaned to the RAA, which then distributed shares to its members. The RAA established its first brothel on August 28: the Komachien in Ōmori. By December 1945, the RAA owned 34 facilities, 16 of which were &quot;comfort stations&quot;. The total number of women employed by the RAA amounted to 55,000 at its peak. 

==Recruitment==

As noted above, the women staffing comfort facilities were initially intended to be those already involved in the &quot;water trade&quot; (a euphemism for the Japanese night-time entertainment business). In practice, there were nowhere near enough prostitutes available, especially in the Tokyo area. The government had cracked down on prostitution late in the war, and many women had fled or been evacuated to the countryside following heavy Allied bombing of strategic centers and residential areas. Tokyo&#x27;s most famous red-light district, Yoshiwara, had been reduced from a prewar population of 2,000 prostitutes to only a few dozen by the end of the war. Therefore, it was inevitable that efforts were made to recruit from the general population, a tactic that was authorized by the police. 

The RAA recruited widely, using carefully worded advertisements posted in front of their offices and in newspapers. These boasted of generous work conditions (free accommodation, meals, and clothes) while avoiding details concerning the nature of the work. Given the widespread poverty and food shortages at the time, and the large number of orphaned and widowed young women, the job offers appeared quite attractive. Most women left upon learning of the deception, but some stayed.

In addition to prostitutes, the RAA recruited a large number of &quot;dancers&quot; who were paid to dance with soldiers. Over time, the distinction between &quot;dancer&quot; and &quot;prostitute&quot; became blurred.

Heavy use was made of independent brokers to recruit women. These brokers, many of whom were affiliated with the yakuza, used less ethical recruitment techniques. The , a government organization for mobilizing girls and women ages 14–25 for work in factories, was a popular target as many of these women were left unemployed and stranded by the end of the war. Yuki Tanaka reports that groups of these women would be deceived and delivered to brothels.

Despite these deceptive recruitment practices, most women working in the comfort stations ultimately consented to work as prostitutes. There were also women who were unable to leave their brothels, however, because they had been sold by their impoverished families or because they owed money to the brothel. Some comfort stations used &quot;company store&quot; tactics and to keep women in debt and unable to leave, something a contemporary GHQ official compared to &quot;enslavement&quot;. Contracts forcing women to work at brothels in repayment of debts were eventually abolished by a SCAP order (SCAPIN 642) in January 1946, although some Japanese officials were skeptical of how well such a prohibition could be enforced. 

==Working conditions==

When using the RAA brothels, GIs received a ticket (costing 100) (approx. 8 cents at the contemporary unofficial rate, ) upon entry which was then given to the women who serviced them. The women, who usually had between 15 and 60 clients per day, would take the tickets to the station&#x27;s accounting office each morning where they would receive 50 for each ticket. This 50% rate was considerably better than that for prewar licensed prostitutes, who commonly only received 25% of their price. For example, on the first day, one Japanese worker had 47 American customers and received around 2 US dollars.

Women working in RAA facilities faced the sexual violence common to prostitution in the sex trade (especially under foreign military occupation). Women working as dancers were especially vulnerable targets for rape. Additionally, military police and GIs sometimes demanded free service or refunds. The power inequality between Japanese police and Allied soldiers made it difficult for the women to complain. Many of the victims were induced to create a &quot;Labour Union&quot;, which then allowed them to be further targeted as the Korean War developed.

==Expansion==

On October 14, the Japanese police lifted their restrictions on brothels and night clubs, a &quot;de facto&quot; endorsement of the non-RAA sex industry catering to Occupation troops. The RAA facilities had also been illegal, but had enjoyed police protection. By the end of November, there were 25 non-RAA comfort stations employing 1,500 women in Tokyo (compared to &quot;well over 2,000&quot; for the RAA.) A December 29 GHQ estimate placed the number of prostitutes in Tokyo at 6,000 (not counting street prostitutes, who far outnumbered the number of women working in brothels.) 

==GHQ and disease control==

From the beginning of the Occupation, some Allied military officials cooperated with the Japanese government&#x27;s system. According to the governors of Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures, American commanders contacted them in September 1945 and requested the establishment of brothels for their troops, offering US military police help if necessary. American medical officers established prophylactic stations in red-light districts and inside the larger brothels that distributed tens of thousands of condoms per week. 

Despite these precautions, the problem of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs; primarily gonorrhea and syphilis) became a serious public health issue. By early 1946, nearly a quarter of all US occupation forces were estimated to be infected, and nearly half of some units. The Australian 34th Infantry Brigade had a rate of 55% infection.

In response, GHQ imposed strict STD check procedures for prostitutes, placed certain brothels with high rates of infection off-limits to troops, and helped re-establish clinics and laboratories (many of which had been destroyed during the war) to diagnose infections. Most importantly, the 8th Army authorized the free dispersal of penicillin to infected prostitutes, despite a serious shortage of the drug in the US, and orders from Washington that it only be given to Japanese &quot;as a life saving measure.&quot;

==End of the system==

Not all those in the occupation forces accepted the widespread patronizing of Japanese-sanctioned brothels by US troops. Some unit commanders considered prostitution an &quot;endemic problem that plagued their troops&quot; and tried (with limited success) to prevent their men from fraternizing with the Japanese. By early 1946 military chaplains were condemning SCAP&#x27;s cooperation, citing violations of War Department policies and the moral degradation of US troops it caused. 

The complaints embarrassed Gen. MacArthur, head of the occupation forces, and SCAP issued an order (SCAPIN 642) on January 21 ending licensed brothels for being &quot;in contravention of the ideals of democracy&quot;. The following day a GHQ public health official wrote MacArthur with his concerns that news of the STD problem and GHQ cooperation with prostitution would cause problems as they spread back home. SCAPIN 642 ended the RAA&#x27;s operations, but did not affect &quot;voluntary prostitution&quot; by individuals. As such, non-RAA brothel owners were easily able to circumvent the order by, for example, &quot;renting&quot; space in their former brothels to &quot;voluntary&quot; prostitutes. Ultimately, GHQ responded by making all brothels and other facilities offering prostitution off-limits to Allied personnel on March 25, 1946.

The immediate effects of the end of authorized brothel prostitution was the sudden unemployment of thousands of women, many of whom went on to become &quot;panpan&quot; street prostitutes. The dispersal of prostitution made it harder for GHQ to control STDs and also caused an increase in sexual violence by GIs, from an average of 40 women a day before the SCAP order to an estimated 330 per day immediately after, however these figures cannot be independently confirmed. 

By November 1946, the Japanese government had introduced the new system in which prostitution was permissible in certain designated areas.

==Comfort Woman terminology==
Because the RAA and related systems were inspired by Japanese wartime experiences, their structures and terminologies were based on the pre-existing wartime comfort women system. Brothels were referred to with the euphemisms &quot;comfort stations&quot; and &quot;comfort facilities&quot;, and prostitutes were referred to as &quot;comfort women&quot;. Because of this, many English-language and Japanese scholars of the RAA continue to use those terms in their research.

To what degree the two systems are actually comparable is a matter of debate among historians, however. Some, such as Michael Molasky and Yuki Tanaka, stress the &quot;striking&quot; similarities between the two and refer to the RAA as &quot;systematic exploitation&quot;. Chung-hee Sarah Soh, by contrast, notes that women in the RAA were provided with better living conditions than their wartime counterparts. Sarah Kovner states that a difference between the two systems is that RAA members could not be forced into prostitution for Allied occupation troops. Bob Wakabayashi writes though that coercive recruitment was employed in a manner similar to the wartime system.

Ikuhiko Hata indicates that the two systems were comparable in both methods of recruitment and administration in spite of the difference of the presence or absence of intermediary people.

<text>Cambodia is divided into 25 provinces (, ). The capital Phnom Penh is not a province but an &quot;autonomous municipality&quot; (, ; lit. &#x27;capital&#x27;), equivalent to a province governmentally and administered at the same level as the other 24 provinces.

Phnom Penh has both the highest population and the highest population density of all provinces, but is the second smallest in land area. The largest province by area is Mondulkiri and the smallest is Kep which is also the least populated province. Mondulkiri has the lowest population density.

Each province is administered by a governor, who is nominated by the Ministry of Interior, subject to approval by the Prime Minister.

Provinces are divided into districts (, &quot;srŏk&quot;). The districts in Phnom Penh are called &quot;khan&quot; () normally written as for addresses in English followed by the districts&#x27; names (Ex: Khan Chamkar Mon; lit. &#x27;Chamkar Mon District&#x27;). The number of districts in each province varies, from two in the smallest provinces to 14 in Battambang, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap. Further subdivision levels are &quot;communes&quot; ( &quot;khum&quot;), and further subdivided into villages (, &quot;phum&quot;). In Phnom Penh, &quot;sangkat&quot; () is used in the place of &quot;khum&quot; and, similar to &quot;khan&quot;, normally preferred for writing addresses in English (Ex: Sangkat Mittapheap; lit. &#x27;Mittapheap Commune&#x27;).


== List of provinces ==

== History ==
* 1974: The Khmer Rouge government did away with the former Cambodian traditional administrative divisions. Instead of provinces, Democratic Kampuchea was divided into seven geographic zones (, ): the Northwest, the North, the Northeast, the East, the Southwest, the West, and the Centre. These zones were derived from divisions established by the Khmer Rouge when they fought against the Khmer Republic during the Cambodian Civil War.

* 2008: On 22 December 2008, King Norodom Sihamoni signed a decree that changed the municipalities of Kep, Pailin and Sihanoukville into provincial municipalities, as well as adjusting several provincial borders.

* 2013: On 31 December 2013, King Norodom Sihamoni signed a decree that split Kampong Cham into two provinces: Kampong Cham (west of the Mekong River) and Tboung Khmum (east of the Mekong River).

* 2018: In September 2018, Interior Minister Sar Kheng proposed establishing two more provinces, with areas taken from Kandal, Mondulkiri, and Ratanakiri. Prime Minister Hun Sen rejected the plan.

<text>Bora Bora (French: &quot;Bora-Bora&quot;; Tahitian: &quot;Pora Pora&quot;) is an island group in the Leeward Islands in the South Pacific. The Leeward Islands comprise the western part of the Society Islands of French Polynesia, which is an overseas collectivity of the French Republic in the Pacific Ocean. Bora Bora has a total land area of . The main island, located about northwest of Papeete, is surrounded by a lagoon and a barrier reef. In the center of the island are the remnants of an extinct volcano, rising to two peaks, Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu; the highest point is at . Bora Bora is part of the Commune of Bora-Bora, which also includes the atoll of Tūpai. The main languages spoken in Bora Bora are Tahitian and French. However, due to the high tourist population, many natives of Bora Bora have learned to speak English.

Bora Bora is a major international tourist destination, famous for its seaside (and even offshore) luxury resorts. Its major settlement, Vaitape, is on the western side of the main island, opposite the main channel leading into the lagoon. Produce of the island is mostly limited to what can be obtained from the sea and from the plentiful coconut trees, which were historically of economic importance for the production of copra.

==Name==
In ancient times, the island was called , meaning &quot;created by the gods&quot; in the local Tahitian language. This was often abbreviated as , meaning simply &quot;first born&quot;. The Tahitian language, along with the English, French, and Dutch languages, uses a unique set of phonemes, so the spelling and pronunciation of the name changes as it passes from one language to another. Since Tahitian does not distinguish between the sounds [] and [], the sound represented by lies between the two, and represents a sound not present in English similar in sound to [] and []. English, French, or Dutch speakers can confuse the Tahitian pronunciation of as or . When explorer Jacob Roggeveen first landed on the island, he and his crew adopted the name , which has stood ever since.

==History==

The island was inhabited by Polynesian settlers around the 3rd century CE. The first European sighting was made by Jacob Roggeveen in 1722.

James Cook sighted the island on 29 July 1769, with the help of a Tahitian navigator, Tupaia. The London Missionary Society arrived in 1820 and founded a Protestant church in 1890. Bora Bora was an independent kingdom until 1888, when the French annexed the island as a colony and forced its last queen, Teriimaevarua III, to abdicate.

===World War II===
During World War II, the United States chose Bora Bora as a South Pacific military supply base and constructed an oil depot, an airstrip, a seaplane base, and defensive fortifications. The expedition, known as &quot;Operation Bobcat&quot;, comprised nine ships, of equipment, and nearly 7,000 soldiers.

At least eight 7-inch/44-caliber guns were operated by some members of the 13th Coast Artillery Regiment (later renamed the 276th Coast Artillery Battalion). The guns were set up at strategic points around the island to protect it against a potential military attack. All eight of these guns remain in the area to this day.

However, the island saw no combat. The American presence on Bora Bora went uncontested for the entire course of the war. The base was officially closed on 2 June 1946. The World War II airstrip was never enlarged to accommodate large aircraft, but it was nonetheless French Polynesia&#x27;s only international airport until 1960, when Faa&#x27;a International Airport opened next to Papeete, Tahiti.

== Geography ==

It is located in the so-called Society Islands, which are part of French Polynesia, and is located northwest of Tahiti, about northwest of Papeete, Tahiti. It also has around it several motus ( is a Tahitian word meaning &quot;small islands&quot;), which are small elongated islets that usually have some width and vegetation. One of the most beautiful and photographed motus in Polynesia is Motu Tapu, to the west of the main island, especially before a hurricane carried away part of the tongues of sand at its ends.
=== Dimensions ===
Bora Bora is among the smaller of the islands of the Society archipelago: the main island measures only from north to south and east to west; the total area of Bora Bora, including islets, is less than . Bora Bora has an area of on the mountainous central island, which is an extinct volcano, itself surrounded by a lagoon separated from the sea by a reef. The highest point is Mount Otemanu, at .

=== Description ===
Bora Bora is formed by an extinct volcano, surrounded by a lagoon and a fringing reef. Its summit is Mount Otemanu, located in the center of the atoll; another summit, Mount Pahia, on the main island is high.

The main island has four open bays overlooking the lagoon: Faanui Bay, Tuuraapuo Bay and Povai Bay to the west, and Hitiaa Bay to the northwest. Tuuraapuo Bay separates the main island from two islets of volcanic nature: Toopua and Toopua-iti.

Necklace-shaped coral reefs surround the central island and protect it from the open sea as if it were a dike. It is a barrier reef with only one opening to the ocean: the Teavanui Passage, located west of the main island, which allows most large cargo ships and cruise ships to enter the lagoon.

They must, however, stay in the channel, as much of the lagoon water is shallow outside the Teavanui Passage. The barrier reef is very wide in some sections, where it exceeds two kilometers in width to the southwest of the island. To the east and north of the island, the reef supports a series of islets made up of coral ruins and sand (the motu). One such motu in the north, the Motu Mute, is where the U.S. Army built an air base during the Second World War, which has now become the airport of Bora Bora.

The lagoon, abundant in fish, is remarkable for its breadth and beauty. Its color varies with depth: dark indigo when it is deep (Teavanui Passage, Poofai and Faanui bays) and pastel shades of blue and green elsewhere. Corals, when they are very close to the surface, along with the fauna that colonizes them, come to wear a wide variety of colors: egg yolk, red, blue or purple.

=== Geology ===
Bora Bora is part of a group of volcanic islands linked to the activity of a hazardous area. It is an extinct volcano which was active in the Upper Pliocene (between 3.45 and 3.10 million years ago), and then underwent at least partial depression and strong erosion under a hot and humid tropical climate.

The bay of Tuuraapuo was the main crater of the volcano, whose collapsed southwestern edge only subsists still in the islets Toopua and Toopua-iti, which culminate respectively at and , altitude. The volcanic rocks are of basaltic type, consisting mostly of alkaline basalts, some hawaiites, and some gabbro intrusions, especially on the islet Toopua. They come mostly from voids, with explosive episodes being rare.

=== Climate ===
Bora Bora has a tropical monsoon climate. Temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year, with hot days and warm nights. The dry season lasts from June to October, but there is some precipitation even during those months.

 The rainy season is between November and April, with a heavy atmosphere and sometimes violent storms resulting in heavy rains. These rains can last several days, but this does not preclude many sunny days during the wet season. The humidity level usually ranges from 75% to 90%, sometimes reaching 100%. The dry season is between April and October, with warm and fairly dry weather, but the trade winds sometimes blow strongly. The days are still sunny, but although the dry season is present, this does not prevent the occurrence of some showers or even thunderstorms in the afternoon.

During the dry season, the average humidity level remains between 45 and 60%; sometimes, this level rises spontaneously to 80%, especially at night when the ground heat remains high and exceeds a certain threshold. These &quot;dry season&quot; storms will occur in the afternoon.

==Tourism==

The island&#x27;s economy is driven almost entirely by tourism. Several resorts have been built on the surrounding the lagoon. Hotel Bora Bora opened in 1961, and nine years later the first over-water bungalows on stilts over the lagoon were built. Today, over-water bungalows are a standard feature of most Bora Bora resorts. The bungalows range from relatively inexpensive basic accommodations to luxurious and expensive ones.

Most of the tourist destinations are sea-oriented; however, there are also tourist attractions on land, such as World War II cannons. Air Tahiti operates five or six flights daily between Tahiti and the Bora Bora Airport on Motu Mute (as well as occasional flights to and from other islands). There is no public transport on the island, so rental cars and bicycles are the recommended means of transport. In addition, there are small, two-seater buggies for hire in Vaitape, and motorboats can be rented to explore the lagoon. Vaitape is a village on the west side of the island and is home to a large part of the island&#x27;s population. The village has also become a popular spot for tourism.

Snorkeling and scuba diving in and around Bora Bora&#x27;s lagoon are popular activities. Many species of sharks and rays inhabit the surrounding waters, and a few dive operators on the island offer manta-ray dives and shark-feeding dives. (The species of shark living in the island&#x27;s lagoon are not considered dangerous to people.)

In addition to the existing islands of Bora Bora, the artificial island of Motu Marfo was added in the northeastern corner of the lagoon, on the St. Regis Resort property.

=== Places of interest ===

The main attraction of Bora Bora is the lagoon with its still intact underwater world. Using glass bottom boats, diving, and snorkeling, tourists can explore the reef with thousands of colorful coral fish. In the deep lagoon, tourists can feed barracudas and sharks during guided diving excursions. An attraction for divers is the &quot;Stingray Strait&quot;, an area of the lagoon where several species of stingrays are found in large schools, including numerous manta rays and leopard rays.

Parts of the interior of the island can be explored on jeep safaris. However, the natural beauty of the island is best explored on foot. Several hikes can be done from Vaitape, but it is advisable to rely on a guide to keep one&#x27;s bearings. The hike to the top of Mount Pahia, from where, according to legend, the war god Oro descended on a rainbow, leads through orchards, forests, orchid fields and fern-covered crevices. One can also climb Mount Otemanu, which offers a beautiful panoramic view of the atoll. Below the summit is a large grotto where numerous frigate birds nest.

Another attraction is the remains of what were more than 40 marae (ceremonial platforms). The best preserved are Marae Fare Opu in Faanui Bay and Marae Aehau-tai or Temaruteaoa at the eastern end of Vairau Bay. Another large Aboriginal ceremonial site is Marae Marotitini, in the north of the main island, right on the beach. The stone platform of the complex was originally long and was restored in 1968 by Japanese archaeologist Yosihiko Sinoto. Two stone box tombs of the royal family were found in the area of the complex.

Most beaches (and also the numerous hotels) are located in the two large bays between Pointe Paopao and Pointe Matira, in the southwest of the island. About five kilometers south of Vaitape, directly on the main road, is Bloody Mary&#x27;s, a bar and restaurant frequented by many guests with its own yacht jetty. The two wooden plaques at the entrance list 230 names, including Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda, and Diana Ross.

== Flora and fauna ==

In the relatively densely populated and intensively used lowland regions for a Polynesian atoll, hardly any remnants of the original vegetation remain. In contrast, the flora of the high, steep mountains, which are difficult to access, remains largely untouched.

The back beach areas are fringed with low-lying, heavily vegetated &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot; and &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;. A cultivated form with a straight trunk and a rounded crown, &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot; var. &quot;sterilis&quot;, is often planted as roadside vegetation.

Up to the foot of the steep mountainous region, there is mainly cultivated land, with plantations of coconut palms, breadfruit trees, Tahitian chestnuts (&quot;Inocarpus&quot;), cassava (&quot;Manihot&quot;), and tropical fruits, as well as orchid plantations for the decoration of tourist hotels. Abandoned areas have been conquered by overgrown guavas and the fern &quot;Dicranopteris linearis&quot;.

The crevices and ridges of the island&#x27;s mountains are covered with largely undisturbed remnants of the island&#x27;s original vegetation. These include groves of metrosider trees; stands of &quot;Wikstroemia coriacea&quot;, a species of the daphne family endemic to Polynesia; and a few species of &quot;Glochidion&quot;. The humid and shady crevices are densely populated with ferns.

Historically, Bora Bora&#x27;s virgin forest habitats on the slopes of Mount Otemanu had a very diverse assortment of snail and slug species (gastropods) compared to other islands. Several species of endemic or native species existed in great numbers until relatively recently; however, after &quot; Lissachatina&quot;, &quot;Euglandina&quot;, and various flatworms were introduced to the island, they wiped out the populations of the endemic partulid species &quot;Partula lutea&quot; the late 1990s, &quot;Samoana attenuata&quot; (a species once native to Bora Bora but later not found in surveys of the island), and &quot;Mautodontha boraborensis&quot; (a critically endangered species as of 1996 but most likely extinct, as it was last seen in the 1880s). The above-listed native and endemic species were mostly restricted to the virgin forests, and the only species that remain common (perhaps even extant) are several subulinids and tornatellinids among others, including &quot;Orobophana pacifica (&quot;a helicinid&quot;).&quot;

Many species of sharks and rays inhabit the strip of water surrounding the island. There are dive operators that offer dives to observe the fish and watch the sharks feed.

== Demographics ==
In 2012, the population was 9,858, which increased to 10,605 according to 2017 estimates.
=== Religion ===
Christianity has been the dominant religion since the arrival of Christian missionaries in the 19th century, when it replaced the old traditional beliefs that Europeans considered idolatry. Vaitape was founded by British missionary John Muggridge Orsmond (1788–1856) of the London Missionary Society. He came to Bora Bora from Tahiti in 1824 and built a church, a wharf, roads and houses, and a missionary school made of coral rock. This settlement, called &quot;Beulah&quot;, became what is now Vaitape.

With the establishment of the French protectorate, the presence of the Catholic Church was reinforced. Today, it administers a church island&#x27;s capital (Vaitape), called Saint-Pierre-Célestin Church (). It depends on the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Papeete with its seat in Tahiti.

Numerous pre-Christian relics from the native Polynesians of Bora Bora are still preserved today: remains of 13 ceremonial platforms (marae) – there used to be more than forty – and many petroglyphs, which, however, are mostly hidden in inaccessible bushes. The best preserved ceremonial site is the Marae Fare Opu in Faʻanui Bay, located directly on the beach. Today, a road runs through the area, so the overview of the site, which is quite large, has been lost. The site consisted of a rectangular, level area bounded by boulders and a stone platform. The rectangular platform is bounded by limestone slabs over 1 m high and filled with earth. Two of the slabs on the north side have stone carvings with turtle motifs.

=== Languages ===
French, as in the rest of France, is the sole official language of Bora-Bora; it and Tahitian are the main languages spoken by its inhabitants in a common way. In addition, those in contact with tourists generally have some basic knowledge of English. 

Most visitors to Bora Bora are American, Australian, Japanese, or European.

== Politics and government ==
The atoll has been part of France since the 19th century. Its island capital is Vaitape. The Tupai Atoll, nearby and uninhabited, is an administrative dependency of Bora Bora. The municipality Bora-Bora consists of the island of Bora Bora and the Tupai Atoll. The mayor of Bora Bora has been Gaston Tong Sang since 9 July 1989.

Bora Bora is politically part of French Polynesia. The island is a French overseas territory and is not part of the European Union. It is administered by a subdivision of the High Commissariat of the Republic in French Polynesia () based in Papeete. Bora-Bora is one of the seven municipalities of the Leeward Islands Administrative Subdivision (), and in turn is subdivided into the three submunicipalities () of Nunue, Faʻanui (plus Tupai Atoll, further north) and Anau. The currency is the CFP franc, which is pegged to the euro.

== Transportation ==
Bora Bora can be reached via the Bora Bora Airport. On the main island, rental cars and bicycles are the recommended system of transportation. There are also helicopter tours and off-road vehicle or catamaran rentals in Vaitape. On the main island, a public bus () travels around the island in about an hour along the ring road. Stops are not necessary; the bus stops wherever passengers want. However, the preferred means of transport for tourists are bicycle, moped or motorcycle, and the shuttle service offered by some hotels. Small electric cars can be rented in Vaitape. There is a private helicopter stationed on the island, which is used for tourist flights.

== Sports ==
In terms of sports, Bora Bora is, along with neighboring Huahine, Raiatea, and Tahaa, one of the four islands among which the , an international competition of Polynesian canoes (va&#x27;a), is held.

<text>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) is a British charity that aims to save lives and prevent life-changing injuries which occur as a result of accidents. In the past, it has successfully campaigned on issues of road safety, including playing an integral role in the introduction of drink-drive legislation, the compulsory wearing of seatbelts and the ban on handheld mobile phones while driving, as well as on issues of occupational health and safety.

==History and development==

The origins of RoSPA date to the First World War when, in response to the &#x27;alarming increase in road accidents&#x27; during the blackouts, the London &#x27;Safety First&#x27; Council was established on 1 Dec 1916. In 1917, accident data were collected, there was a call to license all drivers, three children&#x27;s safety competitions were run (involving 57,000 pupils) and a railway safety committee was established. A campaign to change the pedestrian rule so that walkers face oncoming traffic was so successful that fatal accidents caused by pedestrians stepping into the path of vehicles fell by 70 per cent in 12 months.

Also in 1917 a separate body, the Industrial &quot;Safety First&quot; Committee was established, and as a result in 1918 the British Industrial &quot;Safety First&quot; Association (BISFA) was formed to tackle workplace safety on a national scale.

In 1920, the Duke of York became President of the London &quot;Safety First&quot; Council; when his presidency ended in 1923 he became Patron. Also in 1923 The National &quot;Safety First&quot; Association was formed with the London &quot;Safety First&quot; Council and BISFA affiliated to it. The Duke of York became Patron of The National &quot;Safety First&quot; Association in 1926. In 1930, a Scottish &quot;Safety First&quot; Council was set up.

In 1932 the National &quot;Safety First&quot; Association extended its activities to Home Safety, and Caroline Haslett, director of the Electrical Association for Women, was appointed as chair of Home Safety Committee, a post she held until 1936, becoming the first woman vice president in 1937.

In 1936 the Duke of York became King George VI and continued as Patron of the Association. In 1941, with the agreement of the King, the Association changed its name to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents – as it is known today.

RoSPA&#x27;s work concerns safety on the road (the organisation estimates that 550,000 people have died on Britain&#x27;s roads since Bridget Driscoll&#x27;s death in 1896.), at work, in the home, at leisure, on and in the water as well as safety education for the young.

RoSPA is governed by an executive committee and board of Trustees. The organisation employs approximately 120 staff, located in the head office in Birmingham and at regional offices in Edinburgh and Cardiff.

==Cycling Proficiency==
The Cycling Proficiency Test was created by RoSPA in 1947 as a minimum recommended standard for cycling on British roads. The National Cycling Proficiency Scheme was introduced by the government in 1958, with statutory responsibility for road safety being given to local authorities in 1974, including the provision of child cyclist training but the scheme continued to be associated with RoSPA. The scheme was superseded by the National Standards for Cycle Training, branded Bikeability in England.

==RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders==
RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders (RoADAR) constitutes a significant part of the charity&#x27;s impact. It aims to reduce road accidents by improving driving standards, knowledge and skill. To do this, RoSPA Advanced Drivers and Riders have over 65 local groups that provide – often free – training to improve driving and motorcycling skills. After suitable training, the charity offers an optional advanced driving test.

<text>The title Baron Buckhurst has been created twice; once in the Peerage of England and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was first created in 1567 for Thomas Sackville, MP for East Grinstead and Aylesbury. He was later created Earl of Dorset in 1604. That creation became extinct in 1843.

It was next created in 1864 for Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr, the sister of the 4th Duke (and 10th Earl) of Dorset, wife of the 5th Earl De La Warr, with special remainder intended to keep it separate from the earldom. Lady De La Warr was thus succeeded in the barony by her second son. When he also succeeded his brother as 7th Earl De La Warr, the Buckhurst title would have passed immediately to the next brother (Mortimer, later created Baron Sackville), but the House of Lords found such &quot;shifting remainders&quot; invalid (&quot;Buckhurst Peerage Case&quot;) and the titles became inseparable.

<doc id="510723" wikidata="Q808599" url="?curid=510723" title="Baron Brabourne">
<text>Baron Brabourne, of Brabourne in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1880 for the Liberal politician Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen, the second son of Sir Edward Knatchbull, 9th Baronet, of Mersham Hatch. He had previously represented Sandwich in the House of Commons and served as Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs and Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. Lord Brabourne had assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Hugessen (which was that of his maternal grandmother) in 1849. His son, the second Baron, represented Rochester in Parliament as a Liberal.

In 1917, his younger brother, the fourth Baron, who had succeeded his nephew the third Baron in 1915, inherited the Baronetcy of Mersham Hatch. Since then, the titles have remained merged. The fourth Baron was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. He was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Ashford, Governor of Bombay and Governor of Bengal. In 1919, Lord Brabourne assumed by deed poll the surname of Knatchbull only.

His eldest son, the sixth Baron, was killed in the Second World War, when the title passed to the latter&#x27;s younger brother, the seventh Baron. He was a film and television producer. In 1946, he married Patricia Mountbatten, daughter of the naval commander Viscount Mountbatten (later the 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma). Their son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded in 2005, is also the Earl Mountbatten of Burma (since 2017). This means that the Barony of Brabourne is held jointly by the current and future Earls Mountbatten of Burma descended only from male lines of the 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma and her husband, the 7th Baron Brabourne. Should that male line become extinct, the titles will then separate or become extinct, depending on collateral male lines existing from previous holders of the titles.

The Baronetcy, of Mersham Hatch in the County of Kent, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1641 for Sir Norton Knatchbull, who represented Kent and New Romney in the House of Commons. His son, the second Baronet, also represented these constituencies in Parliament. His nephew, the fourth Baronet (who had succeeded his father, a younger brother of the second Baronet), sat as Member of Parliament for Rochester, Kent and Lostwithiel. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baronet, who served as High Sheriff of Kent in 1733. In 1746, he assumed by private act of the Parliament of Ireland the additional surname of Wyndham, pursuant to the will of his mother&#x27;s father, Thomas Wyndham, 1st Baron Wyndham. His son, the sixth Baronet, represented Kent in Parliament. On his death, the title passed to his uncle, the seventh Baronet. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as representative for Armagh. His son, the eighth Baronet, was High Sheriff of Kent in 1785 and later represented Kent in the House of Commons.

He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Baronet, whose daughter married Edward Knight, the nephew of Jane Austen. He represented both Kent and East Kent in Parliament and notably served as Paymaster General in the Tory administrations of Sir Robert Peel. His grandson, the twelfth Baronet, briefly represented East Kent in the House of Commons. On his death in 1917, he was succeeded by his first cousin, the 4th Baron Brabourne, who became the thirteenth Baronet of Mersham Hatch as well.

The 8th Baron Brabourne inherited the peerage of Earl Mountbatten of Burma upon the death of his mother, Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma, on 13 June 2017. As consequence, the Barony of Brabourne, as well the Knatchbull Baronetcy, became subsidiary titles to that of the earldom.

The title of the barony is pronounced &quot;&quot;Bray&quot;-burn&quot;. The family seat is Broadlands, near Romsey, Hampshire.

<doc id="510732" wikidata="Q296003" url="?curid=510732" title="Sancha of Castile, Queen of Aragon">
<text>Sancha of Castile (21 September 1154/5 – 9 November 1208) was the only surviving child of King Alfonso VII of León and Castile by his second wife, Richeza of Poland. On January 18, 1174, she married King Alfonso II of Aragon at Zaragoza; they had at least eight children who survived into adulthood.

A patroness of troubadours such as Giraud de Calanson and Peire Raymond, the queen became involved in a legal dispute with her husband concerning properties which formed part of her dower estates. In 1177, she entered the County of Ribagorza and took forcible possession of various castles and fortresses that belonged to the crown there.

After her husband died at Perpignan in 1196, Sancha was relegated to the background of political affairs by her son, Peter II. She retired from court, withdrawing to the Hospitaller convent for noble ladies, the Royal Monastery of Santa María de Sigena, which she had founded. There she assumed the cross of the Knights Hospitaller, which she wore until the end of her life. The queen mother entertained her widowed daughter, Queen Constance, at Sigena before Constance married Emperor Frederick II in 1208. Sancha died soon afterwards, aged fifty-four, and was interred in front of the high altar of her foundation at the Sigena monastery; her tomb is still there to be seen.

<doc id="510738" wikidata="Q20203288" url="?curid=510738" title="Representativeness heuristic">
<text>The representativeness heuristic is used when making judgments about the probability of an event being representional in character and essence of a known prototypical event. It is one of a group of heuristics (simple rules governing judgment or decision-making) proposed by psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in the early 1970s as &quot;the degree to which [an event] (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population, and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated&quot;. 
The representativeness heuristic works by comparing an event to a prototype or stereotype that we already have in mind. For example, if we see a person who is dressed in eccentric clothes and reading a poetry book, we might be more likely to think that they are a poet than an accountant. This is because the person&#x27;s appearance and behavior are more representative of the stereotype of a poet than an accountant.

The representativeness heuristic can be a useful shortcut in some cases, but it can also lead to errors in judgment. For example, if we only see a small sample of people from a particular group, we might overestimate the degree to which they are representative of the entire group. 
Heuristics are described as &quot;judgmental shortcuts that generally get us where we need to go – and quickly – but at the cost of occasionally sending us off course.&quot; Heuristics are useful because they use effort-reduction and simplification in decision-making.

When people rely on representativeness to make judgments, they are likely to judge wrongly because the fact that something is more representative does not actually make it more likely. The representativeness heuristic is simply described as assessing similarity of objects and organizing them based around the category prototype (e.g., like goes with like, and causes and effects should resemble each other).
This heuristic is used because it is an easy computation. The problem is that people overestimate its ability to accurately predict the likelihood of an event. Thus, it can result in neglect of relevant base rates and other cognitive biases.

==Determinants of representativeness==
The representativeness heuristic is more likely to be used when the judgement or decision to be made has certain factors.

===Similarity===

When judging the representativeness of a new stimulus/event, people usually pay attention to the degree of similarity between the stimulus/event and a standard/process. It is also important that those features be salient. Nilsson, Juslin, and Olsson (2008) found this to be influenced by the exemplar account of memory (concrete examples of a category are stored in memory) so that new instances were classified as representative if highly similar to a category as well as if frequently encountered.
Several examples of similarity have been described in the representativeness heuristic literature. This research has focused on medical beliefs. People often believe that medical symptoms should resemble their causes or treatments. For example, people have long believed that ulcers were caused by stress, due to the representativeness heuristic, when in fact bacteria cause ulcers. In a similar line of thinking, in some alternative medicine beliefs patients have been encouraged to eat organ meat that corresponds to their medical disorder. Use of the representativeness heuristic can be seen in even simpler beliefs, such as the belief that eating fatty foods makes one fat. Even physicians may be swayed by the representativeness heuristic when judging similarity, in diagnoses, for example. The researcher found that clinicians use the representativeness heuristic in making diagnoses by judging how similar patients are to the stereotypical or prototypical patient with that disorder.

===Randomness===

Irregularity and local representativeness affect judgments of randomness. Things that do not appear to have any logical sequence are regarded as representative of randomness and thus more likely to occur. For example, THTHTH as a series of coin tosses would not be considered representative of randomly generated coin tosses as it is too well ordered.

Local representativeness is an assumption wherein people rely on the law of small numbers, whereby small samples are perceived to represent their population to the same extent as large samples . A small sample which appears randomly distributed would reinforce the belief, under the assumption of local representativeness, that the population is randomly distributed. Conversely, a small sample with a skewed distribution would weaken this belief.If a coin toss is repeated several times and the majority of the results consists of &quot;heads&quot;, the assumption of local representativeness will cause the observer to believe the coin is biased toward &quot;heads&quot;.

==Tversky and Kahneman&#x27;s classic studies==

===Tom W.===
In a study done in 1973, Kahneman and Tversky divided their participants into three groups:

*&quot;Base-rate group&quot;, who were given the instructions: &quot;Consider all the first-year graduate students in the U.S. today. Please write down your best guesses about the percentage of students who are now enrolled in the following nine fields of specialization.&quot; The nine fields given were business administration, computer science, engineering, humanities and education, law, library science, medicine, physical and life sciences, and social science and social work.
*&quot;Similarity group&quot;, who were given a personality sketch. &quot;Tom W. is of high intelligence, although lacking in true creativity. He has a need for order and clarity, and for neat and tidy systems in which every detail finds its appropriate place. His writing is rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns and by flashes of imagination of the sci-fi type. He has a strong drive for competence. He seems to feel little sympathy for other people and does not enjoy interacting with others. Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep moral sense.&quot; The participants in this group were asked to rank the nine areas listed in part 1 in terms of how similar Tom W. is to the prototypical graduate student of each area.
*&quot;Prediction group&quot;, who were given the personality sketch described in 2, but were also given the information &quot;The preceding personality sketch of Tom W. was written during Tom&#x27;s senior year in high school by a psychologist, on the basis of projective tests. Tom W. is currently a graduate student. Please rank the following nine fields of graduate specialization in order of the likelihood that Tom W. is now a graduate student in each of these fields.&quot;

The judgments of likelihood were much closer for the judgments of similarity than for the estimated base rates. The findings supported the authors&#x27; predictions that people make predictions based on how representative something is (similar), rather than based on relative base rate information. For example, more than 95% of the participants said that Tom would be more likely to study computer science than education or humanities, when there were much higher base rate estimates for education and humanities than computer science.

===The taxicab problem===

In another study done by Tversky and Kahneman, subjects were given the following problem:

A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.

A witness identified the cab as Blue. The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colours 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.

What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was Blue rather than Green knowing that this witness identified it as Blue?

Most subjects gave probabilities over 50%, and some gave answers over 80%. The correct answer, found using Bayes&#x27; theorem, is lower than these estimates:
*There is a 12% probability (0.12 = 0.15 × 0.80) that the blue cab is (correctly) identified by the witness as blue.
*There is a 17% probability (0.17 = 0.85 × 0.20) that the green cab is (incorrectly) identified by the witness as blue.
*There is therefore a 29% probability (0.29 = 0.12 + 0.17) that the cab is identified by the witness as blue.
*This results in a 41% probability (0.41 ≈ 0.12 ÷ 0.29) that the cab identified as blue was actually blue.

This result can be achieved by Bayes&#x27; theorem which states:

formula_1

where:

P(x) - a probability of x, 

B - the cab was blue,

I - the cab is identified by the witness as blue,

B | I - the cab that is identified as blue, was blue,

I | B - the cab that was blue, is identified by the witness as blue.

Representativeness is cited in the similar effect of the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, the regression fallacy and the conjunction fallacy.

==Biases attributed to the representativeness heuristic==

===Base rate neglect and base rate fallacy===

The use of the representativeness heuristic will likely lead to violations of Bayes&#x27; Theorem:
:formula_2
However, judgments by representativeness only look at the resemblance between the hypothesis and the data, thus inverse probabilities are equated:

formula_3

As can be seen, the base rate P(H) is ignored in this equation, leading to the base rate fallacy. A base rate is a phenomenon&#x27;s basic rate of incidence. The base rate fallacy describes how people do not take the base rate of an event into account when solving probability problems. This was explicitly tested by Dawes, Mirels, Gold and Donahue (1993) who had people judge both the base rate of people who had a particular personality trait and the probability that a person who had a given personality trait had another one. For example, participants were asked how many people out of 100 answered true to the question &quot;I am a conscientious person&quot; and also, given that a person answered true to this question, how many would answer true to a different personality question. They found that participants equated inverse probabilities (e.g., formula_4) even when it was obvious that they were not the same (the two questions were answered immediately after each other). 

A medical example is described by Axelsson. Say a doctor performs a test that is 99% accurate, and the patient tests positive for the disease. However, the incidence of the disease is 1/10,000. The patient&#x27;s actual risk of having the disease is 1%, because the population of healthy people is so much larger than the disease. This statistic often surprises people, due to the base rate fallacy, as many people do not take the basic incidence into account when judging probability. Research by Maya Bar-Hillel (1980) suggests that perceived relevancy of information is vital to base-rate neglect: base rates are only included in judgments if they seem equally relevant to the other information.

Some research has explored base rate neglect in children, as there was a lack of understanding about how these judgment heuristics develop. The authors of one such study wanted to understand the development of the heuristic, if it differs between social judgments and other judgments, and whether children use base rates when they are not using the representativeness heuristic. The authors found that the use of the representativeness heuristic as a strategy begins early on and is consistent. The authors also found that children use idiosyncratic strategies to make social judgments initially, and use base rates more as they get older, but the use of the representativeness heuristic in the social arena also increase as they get older. The authors found that, among the children surveyed, base rates were more readily used in judgments about objects than in social judgments. After that research was conducted, Davidson (1995) was interested in exploring how the representativeness heuristic and conjunction fallacy in children related to children&#x27;s stereotyping. Consistent with previous research, children based their responses to problems off of base rates when the problems contained nonstereotypic information or when the children were older. There was also evidence that children commit the conjunction fallacy. Finally, as students get older, they used the representativeness heuristic on stereotyped problems, and so made judgments consistent with stereotypes. There is evidence that even children use the representativeness heuristic, commit the conjunction fallacy, and disregard base rates. 

Research suggests that use or neglect of base rates can be influenced by how the problem is presented, which reminds us that the representativeness heuristic is not a &quot;general, all purpose heuristic&quot;, but may have many contributing factors. Base rates may be neglected more often when the information presented is not causal. Base rates are used less if there is relevant individuating information. Groups have been found to neglect base rate more than individuals do. Use of base rates differs based on context. Research on use of base rates has been inconsistent, with some authors suggesting a new model is necessary.

===Conjunction fallacy===

A group of undergraduates were provided with a description of Linda, modelled to be representative of an active feminist. Then participants were then asked to evaluate the probability of her being a feminist, the probability of her being a bank teller, or the probability of being both a bank teller and feminist. Probability theory dictates that the probability of being both a bank teller and feminist (the conjunction of two sets) must be less than or equal to the probability of being either a feminist or a bank teller. A conjunction cannot be more probable than one of its constituents. However, participants judged the conjunction (bank teller and feminist) as being more probable than being a bank teller alone. Some research suggests that the conjunction error may partially be due to subtle linguistic factors, such as inexplicit wording or semantic interpretation of &quot;probability&quot;. The authors argue that both logic and language use may relate to the error, and it should be more fully investigated.

===Disjunction fallacy===
From probability theory the disjunction of two events is at least as likely as either of the events individually. For example, the probability of being either a physics or biology major is at least as likely as being a physics major, if not more likely. However, when a personality description (data) seems to be very representative of a physics major (e.g., having a pocket protector) over a biology major, people judge that it is more likely for this person to be a physics major than a natural sciences major (which is a superset of physics). 

Evidence that the representativeness heuristic may cause the disjunction fallacy comes from Bar-Hillel and Neter (1993). They found that people judge a person who is highly representative of being a statistics major (e.g., highly intelligent, does math competitions) as being more likely to be a statistics major than a social sciences major (superset of statistics), but they do not think that he is more likely to be a Hebrew language major than a humanities major (superset of Hebrew language). Thus, only when the person seems highly representative of a category is that category judged as more probable than its superordinate category. These incorrect appraisals remained even in the face of losing real money in bets on probabilities. 

===Insensitivity to sample size===

Representativeness heuristic is also employed when subjects estimate the probability of a specific parameter of a sample. If the parameter highly represents the population, the parameter is often given a high probability. This estimation process usually ignores the impact of the sample size. 

A concept proposed by Tversky and Kahneman provides an example of this bias in a problem about two hospitals of differing size.

The values shown in parentheses are the number of students choosing each answer.

The results show that more than half the respondents selected the wrong answer (third option). This is due to the respondents ignoring the effect of sample size. The respondents selected the third option most likely because the same statistic represents both the large and small hospitals. According to statistical theory, a small sample size allows the statistical parameter to deviate considerably compared to a large sample. Therefore, the large hospital would have a higher probability to stay close to the nominal value of 50%.

<text>USS &quot;Niantic&quot; (CVE-46) was a US escort carrier, that served in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Ranee&quot; (D03).

&quot;Niantic&quot;, originally given the designation AVG-46, was redesignated as ACV-46 on 20 August 1942. The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation at their yard in Tacoma, Washington on 5 January 1943. The vessel was launched on 2 June, sponsored by Mrs. Ray V. Blanco. She was redesignated again to CVE-46 on 15 July that year and transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 8 November, when she was commissioned into the Royal Navy.

As one of the 38 converted C3 escort carriers transferred to the United Kingdom, &quot;Ranee&quot; joined the merchant aircraft carriers guarding the Atlantic convoy routes. Assigned to the Western Approaches, her aircraft helped to turn the tables on foraging U-boats in the North Atlantic and also assisted in operations to close their northern transit into the Atlantic and track them down in the Bay of Biscay. On 27 February 1945 she sailed from San Diego with USMC squadron VMO-7 embarked for Pearl Harbor. Serving with Training Squadron, Western Approaches, at the end of 1945, she was returned to US custody at Norfolk, Virginia on 21 November 1946. She was declared not essential to the defense of the US, and struck from the Navy List on 22 January 1947. She was sold into merchant service 9 June 1947 to the Waterman Steamship Corporation, in Mobile, Alabama as &quot;Friesland&quot; (later &quot;Pacific Breeze&quot;). She was sold for scrap in Taiwan in 1974.

==Design and description==
These ships were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two boilers connected to a steam turbine, which in turn drove one shaft giving ; it could propel the ship at .
Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge/flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. The ship&#x27;s armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 dual purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon in single mounts. She had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine torpedo bombers.

<text>The Regional Assemblies (Preparations) Act 2003 (c 10) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Its core provision was to allow the Deputy Prime Minister to make orders for referendums in each of the Regions of England on the question of whether they wish to have an elected regional assembly. If the answer was &quot;yes&quot;, this would have been implemented by further legislation; and existing two-tier local government areas (shire counties) would have become unitary authorities.

Three such referendums (the Northern England referendums) were expected in 2004, for the regions of North East and North West England and Yorkshire and the Humber. There were no immediate plans for any in the other 5 applicable regions (East of England, East Midlands, South East, South West, West Midlands). Greater London already has the London Assembly.

It contained further consequential provisions, including causing the Boundary Committee for England to make recommendations about what the pattern of unitary authorities should be; and then if a referendum was successful, the composition of the Assemblies. It was expected that the proposed assemblies would have had a similar level of representation to the London Assembly, which has 25 members, 14 of which represent constituencies, the remainder being apportioned on a top-up party list system.

Following the overwhelming defeat of the referendum in North East England, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott told the House of Commons he would not move orders for the other two referendums within the effective time limit of June 2005 permitted by the Act. The Act was repealed by the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009.

<text>The USS &quot;Perdido&quot; (CVE-47) (previously AVG-47, later ACV-47) was a &quot;Bogue&quot;-class escort carrier laid down as ACV-47 under Maritime Commission contract by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington, 1 February 1943; launched 16 June 1943; sponsored by Mrs. H. M. Bemis, reclassified as CVE-47 on 15 July 1943; and completed at the Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon.

Assigned to the United Kingdom under lend lease 23 June 1943, &quot;Perdido&quot; was taken over by the Royal Navy at Portland, 31 January 1944. During the remainder of World War II, she served the Royal Navy as &quot;Ruler&quot;-class escort carrier HMS &quot;Trouncer&quot; (D85) and took part in convoy escort and ASW patrol operations. The escort carrier returned to Norfolk, Virginia, 21 February 1946. &quot;Perdido&quot; was returned to the U.S. Navy 3 March 1946, and on 25 March, the Secretary of the Navy authorized her for disposal. Her name was struck from the Naval Register 12 April 1946. She was sold to William B. St. John, delivered to her purchaser 6 March 1947 and pressed into merchant service as &quot;Greystroke Castle&quot; (renamed &quot;Gallic&quot; in 1954 and &quot;Berinnes&quot; in 1959). She was sold for scrap in Taiwan in 1973.

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>Guy Mountfort (4 December 1905 – 23 April 2003) was an English advertising executive, amateur ornithologist and conservationist. He is known for writing the pioneering &quot;A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe&quot;, published in 1954.

==Biography==

Born in London, Mountfort was the writer of the 1954 &quot;A Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe&quot;, with illustrations by Roger Tory Peterson and distribution maps by Philip Hollom. The book was the first to provide a portable, accurate, illustrated guide to essentially all birds likely to be seen in Britain, and its design influenced all subsequent field guides.

In 1961, he created the World Wide Fund for Nature (back then the World Wildlife Fund) with Victor Stolan, Sir Julian Huxley, Sir Peter Scott and Max Nicholson. In 1956, he led an expedition to the Coto Donana with the resulting Book Portrait of a Wilderness illustrated by Eric Hosking. In 1963, he led a party of naturalists and including Huxley, George Shannon James Ferguson-Lees and D. Ian M. Wallace which made the first ornithological expedition to Azraq in Jordan. The expedition&#x27;s recommendations eventually led to the creation of the Azraq Wetland Reserve and other protected areas. Papers from the expedition are in the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Archives. He was appointed an OBE in 1970, for services to ornithology. In 1972, he led the campaign to save the Bengal tiger, persuading Indira Gandhi to create nine tiger reserves in India, with eight others in Nepal and Bangladesh.

<text>The Boundary Committee for England was a statutory committee of the Electoral Commission, an independent body set up by the UK Parliament. The committee&#x27;s aim was to conduct thorough, consultative and robust reviews of local government areas in England, and for its recommendations to be evidence-based, accurate and accepted. The Boundary Committee was abolished in 2010, with its functions assumed by a new Local Government Boundary Commission for England.

The committee&#x27;s responsibilities related solely to local government boundaries: responsibility for parliamentary boundaries lies with the Boundary Commission for England, a non-departmental public body of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

== History/establishment ==

On 1 April 2002 responsibility for electoral reviews in England transferred to the Electoral Commission. On the same day the Boundary Committee for England became a statutory committee of the commission. The committee undertook electoral reviews and made recommendations to the commission as to whether electoral changes should be made in respect of the area under review. The commission then decided whether to implement the committee&#x27;s recommendations. The decision of the commission would be taken at a commission meeting comprising the Electoral Commissioners as members.

The Boundary Committee for England replaced the Local Government Commission for England, which was the body responsible for reviewing the structure of local government in England from 1992 to 2002. The equivalent bodies operating in other parts of the United Kingdom are the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales, the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland and the Local Government Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland.

The protocol on the relationship between the Boundary Committee for England and the Electoral Commission sets out the roles and responsibilities of each body in terms of securing fair boundary arrangements for local elections in England.

== Responsibilities and objectives ==

The Boundary Committee for England was responsible for three types of review: electoral reviews; administrative boundary reviews; and structural reviews.

== Electoral reviews ==

An electoral review considered whether the boundaries of wards or divisions within a local authority need to be altered to take account of changes in electorate. The Electoral Commission would direct the committee to undertake electoral reviews and was then responsible for implementing them.

The committee also looked at the number of councillors, the number of wards or divisions and whether the wards or divisions should be represented by a single councillor, or jointly by two or three councillors.

== Administrative boundary reviews ==
At the request of the Department for Communities and Local Government or of a local authority, or at the Boundary Committee for England&#x27;s instigation, the committee could undertake administrative boundary reviews, which reviewed the external boundaries of a local authority.

== Structural reviews ==

A structural review was used to establish whether one or more single, all-purpose councils, known as unitary authorities, should be established in an area instead of the district and county councils of the existing two-tier system.

== Organisation ==
Chair and committee members

*Max Caller CBE was appointed chair of the Boundary Committee for England in 2007. He also serves as an Electoral Commissioner.

Boundary Committee members:

:*Jane Earl
:*Joan Jones CBE
:*Professor Colin Mellors
:*Dr Peter Knight CBE DL

*The Director of the Boundary Committee for England was Archie Gall

== LDEDC Act – changes to Boundary Committee structure ==
The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, which received royal assent on 12 November 2009, provided for the establishment of the Local Government Boundary Commission for England (LGBCE), and for the transfer to it of all the boundary-related functions of the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee for England. This reflects the recommendations of the Committee on Standards on Public Life (CSPL), which were supported by the Electoral Commission and the Boundary Committee. This transfer took place in April 2010.

<text>USS &quot;Sunset&quot; (CVE-48) (previously AVG-48 then ACV-48) was a . Assigned on 23 August 1942 to MC hull 259, a modified C3-S-A1 laid down on 23 February 1943 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington; launched on 15 July and redesignated CVE-48 the same day; sponsored by Mrs. C.E. Taylor. She was transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease agreement on 19 November; and commissioned the same day as HMS &quot;Thane&quot; (D48), a in the Royal Navy.

HMS &quot;Thane&quot; operated in the North Atlantic protecting convoys and ferrying aircraft for use in the European Theater. On 15 January 1945, while ferrying aircraft in the Irish Sea, she was torpedoed by the and severely damaged, losing her starboard aft 5 inch gun and its sponson, disabling propulsion, and losing 10 men. Taken to Gare Loch in the Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, she was examined, declared a constructive total loss and decommissioned to reserve. She was returned to United States custody while in the United Kingdom on 12 May. Determined to be of no use to the United States Navy, she was slated for disposal in October; and she was subsequently scrapped.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

The last voyage of &quot;Thane&quot; brought the first helicopters to the UK. Nine Sikorsky R-4B Hoverflys were flown on at Norfolk, Virginia on 29–30 December 1944, snowy weather delaying the loading of half of them to the following day. On arrival of the damaged &quot;Thane&quot;, seven were flown off to RDU Abbotsinch and two, thought to be damaged, were craned off.

<text> (, ; also &#x27;task forces&#x27;) were (SS) paramilitary death squads of Nazi Germany that were responsible for mass murder, primarily by shooting, during World War II (1939–1945) in German-occupied Europe. The had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot; () in territories conquered by Nazi Germany, and were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia and cultural elite of Poland, including members of the Catholic priesthood. Almost all of the people they murdered were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars, Jews, and Romani people, as well as actual or alleged partisans throughout Eastern Europe.

Under the direction of Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS- Reinhard Heydrich, the operated in territories occupied by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; (German armed forces) following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The worked hand-in-hand with the Order Police battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of a few people to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at Babi Yar (with 33,771 Jews murdered in two days), and the Rumbula massacre (with about 25,000 Jews murdered in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; cooperated with the , providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass murders. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the , related agencies, and foreign auxiliary personnel murdered more than two million people, including 1.3 million of the 5.5 to 6 million Jews murdered during the Holocaust.

After the close of World War II, 24 officers, including multiple commanding officers, of the were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen trial in 1947–48, charged with crimes against humanity and war crimes. Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were handed out. However, only four of these death sentences were carried out. Four additional leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.

== Formation and Aktion T4 ==
The were formed under the direction of SS- Reinhard Heydrich and operated by the (SS) before and during World War II. The had their origins in the ad hoc formed by Heydrich to secure government buildings and documents following the in Austria in March 1938. Originally part of the (Security Police; SiPo), two units of were stationed in the Sudetenland in October 1938. When military action turned out not to be necessary due to the Munich Agreement, the were assigned to confiscate government papers and police documents. They also secured government buildings, questioned senior civil servants, and arrested as many as 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens. From September 1939, the (Reich Security Main Office; RSHA) had overall command of the .

As part of the drive by the Nazi regime to remove so-called &quot;undesirable&quot; elements from the German population, from September to December 1939 the and others took part in Aktion T4, a program of systematic murder of persons with physical and mental disabilities and patients of psychiatric hospitals. Aktion T4 mainly took place from 1939 to 1941, but the murders continued until the end of the war. Initially the victims were shot by the and others, but gas chambers were put into use by spring 1940.

== Invasion of Poland ==


In response to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade Poland on 1 September 1939, Heydrich re-formed the to travel in the wake of the German armies. Membership at this point was drawn from the SS, the (Security Service; SD), the police, and the Gestapo. Heydrich placed SS- Werner Best in command, who assigned to choose personnel for the task forces and their subgroups, called , from among educated people with military experience and a strong ideological commitment to Nazism. Some had previously been members of paramilitary groups such as the . Heydrich instructed Wagner in meetings in late July that the should undertake their operations in cooperation with the (Order Police; Orpo) and military commanders in the area. Army intelligence was in constant contact with to coordinate their activities with other units.

Initially numbering 2,700 men (and ultimately 4,250 in Poland), the &#x27;s mission was to murder members of the Polish leadership most clearly identified with Polish national identity: the intelligentsia, members of the clergy, teachers, and members of the nobility. As stated by Hitler: &quot;... there must be no Polish leaders; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed, however harsh that sounds&quot;. SS- Lothar Beutel, commander of IV, later testified that Heydrich gave the order for these murders at a series of meetings in mid-August. The lists of people to be murderedhad been drawn up by the SS as early as May 1939, using dossiers collected by the SD from 1936 forward. The performed these murders with the support of the , a paramilitary group consisting of ethnic Germans living in Poland during Operation Tannenberg. Members of the SS, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, and the also shot civilians during the Polish campaign. Approximately 65,000 civilians were murdered by the end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, they murdered Jews, prostitutes, Romani people, and the mentally ill. Psychiatric patients in Poland were initially murdered by shooting, but by spring 1941 gas vans were widely used.

Seven of battalion strength (around 500 men) operated in Poland. Each was subdivided into five of company strength (around 100 men).
* I, commanded by SS- Bruno Streckenbach, acted with 14th Army
* II, SS- Emanuel Schäfer, acted with 10th Army
* III, SS- Herbert Fischer, acted with 8th Army
* IV, SS- Lothar Beutel, acted with 4th Army
* V, SS- Ernst Damzog, acted with 3rd Army
* VI, SS- Erich Naumann, acted in Wielkopolska
* VII, SS- Udo von Woyrsch and SS- Otto Rasch, acted in Upper Silesia and Cieszyn Silesia

Though they were formally under the command of the army, the received their orders from Heydrich and for the most part acted independently of the army. Many senior army officers were only too glad to leave these genocidal actions to the task forces, as the murders violated the rules of warfare as set down in the Geneva Conventions. However, Hitler had decreed that the army would have to tolerate and even offer logistical support to the when it was tactically possible to do so. Some army commanders complained about unauthorised shootings, looting, and rapes committed by members of the and the , to little effect. For example, when Johannes Blaskowitz sent a memorandum of complaint to Hitler about the atrocities, Hitler dismissed his concerns as &quot;childish&quot;, and Blaskowitz was relieved of his post in May 1940. He continued to serve in the army but never received promotion to field marshal.

The final task of the in Poland was to round up the remaining Jews and concentrate them in ghettos within major cities with good railway connections. The intention was to eventually remove all the Jews from Poland, but at this point their final destination had not yet been determined. Together, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet-controlled territory.

== Preparations for Operation Barbarossa ==
On 13 March 1941, in the lead-up to Operation Barbarossa, the planned invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler dictated his &quot;Guidelines in Special Spheres re: Directive No. 21 (Operation Barbarossa)&quot;. Sub-paragraph B specified that Heinrich Himmler would be given &quot;special tasks&quot; on direct orders from the Führer, which he would carry out independently. This directive was intended to prevent friction between the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the SS in the upcoming offensive. Hitler also specified that criminal acts against civilians perpetrated by members of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; during the upcoming campaign would not be prosecuted in the military courts, and thus would go unpunished.

In a speech to his leading generals on 30 March 1941, Hitler described his envisioned war against the Soviet Union. General Franz Halder, the Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff, described the speech:

Though General Halder did not record any mention of Jews, German historian Andreas Hillgruber argued that because of Hitler&#x27;s frequent contemporary statements about the coming war of annihilation against &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot;, his generals would have understood Hitler&#x27;s call for the destruction of the Soviet Union as also comprising a call for the destruction of its Jewish population. The genocide was often described using euphemisms such as &quot;special tasks&quot; and &quot;executive measures&quot;; victims were often described as having been shot while trying to escape. In May 1941, Heydrich verbally passed on the order to murder the Soviet Jews to the SiPo NCO School in Pretzsch, where the commanders of the reorganised were being trained for Operation Barbarossa. In spring 1941, Heydrich and the First Quartermaster of the , General Eduard Wagner, successfully completed negotiations for co-operation between the and the German Army to allow the implementation of the &quot;special tasks&quot;. Following the Heydrich-Wagner agreement on 28 April 1941, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch ordered that when Operation Barbarossa began, all German Army commanders were to immediately identify and register all Jews in occupied areas in the Soviet Union, and fully co-operate with the .

In further meetings held in June 1941 Himmler outlined to top SS leaders the regime&#x27;s intention to reduce the population of the Soviet Union by 30 million people, not only through direct murder of those considered racially inferior, but by depriving the remainder of food and other necessities of life.

=== Organisation starting in 1941 ===

For Operation Barbarossa, initially four were created, each numbering 500–990 men to comprise a total force of 3,000. A, B, and C were to be attached to Army Groups North, Centre, and South; D was assigned to the 11th Army. The for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941. The were under the control of the RSHA, headed by Heydrich and later by his successor, SS- Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Heydrich gave them a mandate to secure the offices and papers of the Soviet state and Communist Party; to liquidate all the higher cadres of the Soviet state; and to instigate and encourage pogroms against Jewish populations. The men of the were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, (Kripo), Orpo, and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. Each was under the operational control of the Higher SS Police Chiefs in its area of operations. In May 1941, General Wagner and SS- Walter Schellenberg agreed that the in front-line areas were to operate under army command, while the army provided the with all necessary logistical support. Given their main task was defeating the enemy, the army left the pacification of the civilian population to the , who offered support as well as prevented subversion. This did not preclude their participation in acts of violence against civilians, as many members of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; assisted the in rounding up and murdering Jews of their own accord.

Heydrich acted under orders from Himmler, who supplied security forces on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis to the local SS and Police Leaders. Led by SD, Gestapo, and Kripo officers, included recruits from the Orpo, Security Service and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, augmented by uniformed volunteers from the local auxiliary police force. Each was supplemented with &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and Order Police battalions as well as support personnel such as drivers and radio operators. On average, the Order Police formations were larger and better armed, with heavy machine-gun detachments, which enabled them to carry out operations beyond the capability of the SS. Each death squad followed an assigned army group as they advanced into the Soviet Union. During the course of their operations, the commanders received assistance from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Activities ranged from the murder of targeted groups of individuals named on carefully prepared lists, to joint citywide operations with which lasted for two or more days, such as the massacres at Babi Yar, perpetrated by the Police Battalion 45, and at Rumbula, by Battalion 22, reinforced by local (auxiliary police). The SS brigades, wrote historian Christopher Browning, were &quot;only the thin cutting edge of German units that became involved in political and racial mass murder.&quot;

Many leaders were highly educated; for example, nine of seventeen leaders of A held doctorate degrees. Three were commanded by holders of doctorates, one of whom (SS- Otto Rasch) held a double doctorate.

Additional were created as additional territories were occupied. E operated in Independent State of Croatia under three commanders, SS- , SS- Günther Herrmann, and lastly SS- Wilhelm Fuchs. The unit was subdivided into five located in Vinkovci, Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Knin, and Zagreb. F worked with Army Group South. G operated in Romania, Hungary, and Ukraine, commanded by SS- . H was assigned to Slovakia. K and L, under SS- Emanuel Schäfer and SS- Ludwig Hahn, worked alongside 5th and 6th Panzer Armies during the Ardennes offensive. Hahn had previously been in command of in Greece.

Other and included (operated in Carinthia, on the border between Slovenia and Austria) under SS- Paul Blobel, (Yugoslavia) (Luxembourg), (Norway) commanded by SS- Franz Walter Stahlecker, (Yugoslavia) under SS- Wilhelm Fuchs and SS- August Meysner, &quot;&quot; (Lithuania, Poland), and (Tunis), commanded by SS- Walter Rauff.

== Killings in the Soviet Union ==

After the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the &#x27;s main assignment was to kill civilians, as in Poland, but this time its targets specifically included Soviet Communist Party commissars and Jews. In a letter dated 2 July 1941 Heydrich communicated to his SS and Police Leaders that the were to execute all senior and middle ranking Comintern officials; all senior and middle ranking members of the central, provincial, and district committees of the Communist Party; extremist and radical Communist Party members; people&#x27;s commissars; and Jews in party and government posts. Open-ended instructions were given to execute &quot;other radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.).&quot; He instructed that any pogroms spontaneously initiated by the population of the occupied territories were to be quietly encouraged.

On 8 July, Heydrich announced that all Jews were to be regarded as partisans, and gave the order for all male Jews between the ages of 15 and 45 to be shot. On 17 July Heydrich ordered that the were to murder all Jewish Red Army prisoners of war, plus all Red Army prisoners of war from Georgia and Central Asia, as they too might be Jews. Unlike in Germany, where the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish anyone with at least three Jewish grandparents, the defined as Jewish anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent; in either case, whether or not the person practised the religion was irrelevant. The unit was also assigned to exterminate Romani people and the mentally ill. It was common practice for the to shoot hostages.

As the invasion began, the Germans pursued the fleeing Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area, with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration. Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, some of which were orchestrated by the , broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, 10,000 Jews had been murdered in 40 pogroms, and by the end of 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by B in Russia and Belarus and C in Ukraine; the further east the travelled, the less likely the residents were to be prompted into murdering their Jewish neighbours.

All four main took part in mass shootings from the early days of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of legality given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being murdered by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some started to use automatic weapons, with survivors being murdered with a pistol shot.

As word of the massacres got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the invasion was so successful that the had insufficient forces to immediately murder all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews were members of the Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would have a negative impact on the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established to make use of the Jews as slave labour until they were all dead, a goal that was postponed until 1942.

The used public hangings as a terror tactic against the local population. An B report, dated 9 October 1941, described one such hanging. Due to suspected partisan activity near Demidov, all male residents aged 15 to 55 were put in a camp to be screened. The screening produced seventeen people who were identified as &quot;partisans&quot; and &quot;Communists&quot;. Five members of the group were hanged while 400 local residents were assembled to watch; the rest were shot.

=== Babi Yar ===

The largest mass shooting perpetrated by the took place on 29 and 30 September 1941 at Babi Yar, a ravine northwest of Kyiv city center in Ukraine that had fallen to the Germans on 19 September. The perpetrators included a company of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; attached to C under Rasch, members of 4a under SS- Friedrich Jeckeln, and some Ukrainian auxiliary police. The Jews of Kyiv were told to report to a certain street corner on 29 September; anyone who disobeyed would be shot. Since word of massacres in other areas had not yet reached Kyiv and the assembly point was near the train station, they assumed they were being deported. People showed up at the rendezvous point in large numbers, laden with possessions and food for the journey.

After being marched northwest of the city centre, the victims encountered a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where they were forced to strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot in the back of the head or the neck by members of the execution squads.

The murders continued for two days, claiming a total of 33,771 victims. Sand was shovelled and bulldozed over the bodies and the sides of the ravine were dynamited to bring down more material. Anton Heidborn, a member of 4a, later testified that three days later that there were still people alive among the corpses. Heidborn spent the next few days helping smooth out the &quot;millions&quot; of banknotes taken from the victims&#x27; possessions. The clothing was taken away, destined to be re-used by German citizens. Jeckeln&#x27;s troops shot more than 100,000 Jews by the end of October.

== Killings in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia ==
 A operated in Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia (the three Baltic countries which had been occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940–1941). According to its own reports to Himmler, A murdered almost 140,000 people in the five months following the 1941 German invasion: 136,421 Jews, 1,064 Communists, 653 people with mental illnesses, 56 partisans, 44 Poles, five Romani, and one Armenian were reported murdered between 22 June and 25 November 1941.

Upon entering Kaunas, Lithuania, on 25 June 1941, the released the criminals from the local jail and encouraged them to join the pogrom which was underway. Between 23 and 27 June 1941, 4,000 Jews were murdered on the streets of Kaunas and in nearby open pits and ditches. Particularly active in the Kaunas pogrom was the so-called &quot;Death Dealer of Kaunas&quot;, a young man who murdered Jews with a crowbar at the Lietukis Garage before a large crowd that cheered each murder with much applause; he occasionally paused to play the Lithuanian national anthem &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; on his accordion before resuming the murders.

As A advanced into Lithuania, it actively recruited local nationalists and antisemitic groups. In July 1941, local Lithuanian collaborators, pejoratively called &quot;White Armbands&quot; (), joined the massacres. A pogrom in the Latvian capital Riga in early July 1941 killed 400 Jews. Latvian nationalist Viktors Arājs and his supporters undertook a campaign of arson against synagogues. On 2 July, A commander Stahlecker appointed Arājs to head the , a of about 300 men, mostly university students. Together, A and the murdered 2,300 Jews in Riga on 6–7 July. Within six months, Arājs and collaborators would murder about half of Latvia&#x27;s Jewish population.

Local officials, the , and the (Auxiliary Police) played a key role in rounding up and massacring local Jews in German-occupied Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. These groups also helped the and other killing units to identify Jews. For example, in Latvia, the , consisting of auxiliary police organised by the Germans and recruited from former Latvian army and police officers, ex-, members of the Pērkonkrusts, and university students, assisted in the murder of Latvia&#x27;s Jewish citizens. Similar units were created elsewhere, and provided much of the manpower for the Holocaust in Eastern Europe.

With the creation of units such as the in Latvia and the in Lithuania, the attacks changed from the spontaneous mob violence of the pogroms to more systematic massacres. With extensive local help, A was the first to attempt to systematically exterminate all the Jews in its area. Latvian historian Modris Eksteins wrote:
In late 1941, the settled into headquarters in Kaunas, Riga, and Tallinn. A grew less mobile and faced problems because of its small size. The Germans relied increasingly on the Latvian and similar groups to perform massacres of Jews.

Such extensive and enthusiastic collaboration with the has been attributed to several factors. Since the Russian Revolution of 1905, the and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence. The 1940–1941 Soviet occupation had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that had been part of Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.

Historian Erich Haberer has suggested that many survived and made sense of the &quot;totalitarian atomization&quot; of society by seeking conformity with communism. As a result, by the time of the German invasion in 1941, many had come to see conformity with a totalitarian regime as socially acceptable behaviour; thus, people simply transferred their allegiance to the German regime when it arrived. Some who had collaborated with the Soviet regime sought to divert attention from themselves by naming Jews as collaborators and murdering them.

=== Rumbula ===
In November 1941 Himmler was dissatisfied with the pace of the exterminations in Latvia, as he intended to move Jews from Germany into the area. He assigned SS- Jeckeln, one of the perpetrators of the Babi Yar massacre, to liquidate the Riga ghetto. Jeckeln selected a site about southeast of Riga near the Rumbula railway station, and had 300 Russian prisoners of war prepare the site by digging pits in which to bury the victims. Jeckeln organised around 1,700 men, including 300 members of the , 50 German SD men, and 50 Latvian guards, most of whom had already participated in mass-murdering of civilians. These troops were supplemented by Latvians, including members of the Riga city police, battalion police, and ghetto guards. Around 1,500 able-bodied Jews would be spared execution so their slave labour could be exploited; a thousand men were relocated to a fenced-off area within the ghetto and 500 women were temporarily housed in a prison and later moved to a separate nearby ghetto, where they were put to work mending uniforms.

Although Rumbula was on the rail line, Jeckeln decided that the victims should travel on foot from Riga to the execution ground. Trucks and buses were arranged to carry children and the elderly. The victims were told that they were being relocated, and were advised to bring up to of possessions. The first day of executions, 30 November 1941, began with the perpetrators rousing and assembling the victims at 4:00 am. The victims were moved in columns of a thousand people toward the execution ground. As they walked, some SS men went up and down the line, shooting people who could not keep up the pace or who tried to run away or rest.

When the columns neared the prepared execution site, the victims were driven some from the road into the forest, where any possessions that had not yet been abandoned were seized. Here the victims were split into groups of fifty and taken deeper into the forest, near the pits, where they were ordered to strip. The victims were driven into the prepared trenches, made to lie down, and shot in the head or the back of the neck by members of Jeckeln&#x27;s bodyguard. Around 13,000 Jews from Riga were murdered at the pits that day, along with a thousand Jews from Berlin who had just arrived by train. On the second day of the operation, 8 December 1941, the remaining 10,000 Jews of Riga were murdered in the same way. About a thousand were murdered on the streets of the city or on the way to the site, bringing the total number of victims for the two-day extermination to 25,000 people. For his part in organising the massacre, Jeckeln was promoted to Leader of the SS Upper Section, Ostland.

== Second sweep ==
 B, C, and D did not immediately follow A&#x27;s example in systematically murdering all Jews in their areas. The commanders, with the exception of A&#x27;s Stahlecker, were of the opinion by the fall of 1941 that it was impossible to murder the entire Jewish population of the Soviet Union in one sweep, and thought the murders should stop. An report dated 17 September advised that the Germans would be better off using any skilled Jews as labourers rather than shooting them. Also, in some areas poor weather and a lack of transportation led to a slowdown in deportations of Jews from points further west. Thus, an interval passed between the first round of massacres in summer and fall, and what American historian Raul Hilberg called the second sweep, which started in December 1941 and lasted into the summer of 1942. During the interval, the surviving Jews were forced into ghettos.

 A had already murdered almost all Jews in its area, so it shifted its operations into Belarus to assist B. In Dnepropetrovsk in February 1942, D reduced the city&#x27;s Jewish population from 30,000 to 702 over the course of four days. The German Order Police and local collaborators provided the extra manpower needed to perform all the shootings. Haberer wrote that, as in the Baltic states, the Germans could not have murdered so many Jews so quickly without local help. He points out that the ratio of Order Police to auxiliaries was 1 to 10 in both Ukraine and Belarus. In rural areas the proportion was 1 to 20. This meant that most Ukrainian and Belarusian Jews were murdered by fellow Ukrainians and Belarusians commanded by German officers rather than by Germans.

The second wave of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed resistance in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, so there was no way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and murdered.

== Transition to gassing ==

After a time, Himmler found that the killing methods used by the were inefficient: they were costly, demoralising for the troops, and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough. Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform. Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems, and many turned to drink. As much as possible, the leaders militarized the genocide. The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility. Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt. Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators: those who were eager to participate right from the start, those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so, and a significant minority who refused to take part. A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task. Commander of D, SS- Otto Ohlendorf, particularly noted this propensity towards excess, and ordered that any man who was too eager to participate or too brutal should not perform any further executions.

During a visit to Minsk in August 1941, Himmler witnessed an mass execution first-hand and concluded that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men. By November he made arrangements for any SS men suffering ill health from having participated in executions to be provided with rest and mental health care. He also decided a transition should be made to gassing the victims, especially the women and children, and ordered the recruitment of expendable native auxiliaries who could assist with the murders. Gas vans, which had been used previously to murder mental patients, began to see service by all four main from 1942. However, the gas vans were not popular with the , because removing the dead bodies from the van and burying them was a horrible ordeal. Prisoners or auxiliaries were often assigned to do this task so as to spare the SS men the trauma. Some of the early mass murders at extermination camps used carbon monoxide fumes produced by diesel engines, similar to the method used in gas vans, but by as early as September 1941 experiments were begun at Auschwitz using Zyklon B, a cyanide-based pesticide gas.

Plans for the total eradication of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalised at the Wannsee Conference, held on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death, and the rest would be murdered in the implementation of the Final Solution of the Jewish question (). Permanent killing centres at Auschwitz, Belzec, Chelmno, Majdanek, Sobibor, Treblinka, and other Nazi extermination camps replaced mobile death squads as the primary method of mass-murder. The remained active, however, and were put to work fighting partisans, particularly in Belarus.

After the defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler realised that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of a special task force, &quot;Sonderaktion 1005&quot;, under SS- Paul Blobel. The unit&#x27;s assignment was to visit mass graves all along the Eastern Front to exhume bodies and burn them in an attempt to cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished at the end of the war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.

By 1944 the Red Army had begun to push the German forces out of Eastern Europe, and the retreated alongside the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. By late 1944, most personnel had been folded into &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the and related agencies killed more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.

== Plans for the Middle East and Britain ==
According to research by German historians Klaus-Michael Mallmann and , Einsatzkommando Egypt, led by Walter Rauff, was formed in 1942 in Athens. The unit was to enter Egypt and Mandatory Palestine once German forces arrived there. According to Mallmann and Cüppers, the unit&#x27;s purpose was to carry out mass-murder of the Jewish populations in those areas. Given its initially small staff of only 24 men, Mallmann and Cüppers point to the further history of the unit, when it was quickly enlarged to more than four times its original strength during its deployment in Tunisia. Furthermore they assume that the commando would have been supported in the annihilation of the Jews by local collaborators, like it happened with the Einsatzgruppen in Eastern Europe. 

Former Iraqi prime minister Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini played roles, engaging in antisemitic radio propaganda, preparing to recruit volunteers, and in raising an Arab-German Battalion that would also follow Egypt to the Middle East. On 20 July 1942 Rauff was sent to Tobruk to report to Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, Commander of the . Since Rommel was 500 km away at the First Battle of El Alamein, it is unlikely that the two met. The plans for Egypt were set aside after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.

Had Operation Sea Lion—the German plan for an invasion of the United Kingdom—been launched, six were scheduled to follow the invasion force into Britain. They were provided with a list called the (&#x27;Special Search List, G.B&#x27;), known as The Black Book after the war, of 2,300 people to be immediately imprisoned by the Gestapo. The list included Churchill, members of the cabinet, prominent journalists and authors, and members of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile.

== Jäger Report ==

The kept official records of many of their massacres and provided detailed reports to their superiors. The Jäger Report, filed by Commander SS- Karl Jäger on 1 December 1941 to his superior, Stahlecker (head of A), covers the activities of III in Lithuania over the five-month period from 2 July 1941 to 25 November 1941.

Jäger&#x27;s report provides an almost daily running total of the liquidations of 137,346 people, the vast majority of them Jews. The report documents the exact date and place of massacres, the number of victims, and their breakdown into categories (Jews, Communists, criminals, and so on). Women were shot from the very beginning, but initially in fewer numbers than men. Children were first included in the tally starting in mid-August, when 3,207 people were murdered in Rokiškis on 15–16 August 1941. For the most part the report does not give any military justification for the murders; people were murdered solely because they were Jews. In total, the report lists over 100 executions in 71 different locations. Jäger wrote: &quot;I can state today that the goal of solving the Jewish problem in Lithuania has been reached by 3. There are no more Jews in Lithuania, apart from working Jews and their families.&quot; In a February 1942 addendum to the report, Jäger increased the total number of victims to 138,272, giving a breakdown of 48,252 men, 55,556 women, and 34,464 children. Only 1,851 of the victims were non-Jewish.

Jäger escaped capture by the Allies when the war ended. He lived in Heidelberg under his own name until his report was discovered in March 1959. Arrested and charged, Jäger committed suicide on 22 June 1959 in Hohenasperg Fortress while awaiting trial for his crimes.

==Involvement of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;==

The murders took place with the knowledge and support of the German Army in the east. As ordered by Hitler, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; cooperated with the , providing logistical support for their operations, and participated in the mass killings. On 10 October 1941 Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the German Sixth Army on the Eastern Front. Now known as the Severity Order, it read in part:

Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt of Army Group South expressed his &quot;complete agreement&quot; with the order. He sent out a circular to the generals under his command urging them to release their own versions and to impress upon their troops the need to exterminate the Jews. General Erich von Manstein, in an order to his troops on 20 November, stated that &quot;the Jewish-Bolshevist system must be exterminated once and for all.&quot; Manstein sent a letter to D commanding officer Ohlendorf complaining that it was unfair that the SS was keeping all of the murdered Jews&#x27; wristwatches for themselves instead of sharing with the Army.

Beyond this trivial complaint, the Army and the worked closely and effectively. On 6 July 1941 4b of C reported that &quot;Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews&quot;. Few complaints about the murders were ever raised by &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers. On 8 September, D reported that relations with the German Army were &quot;excellent&quot;. In the same month, Stahlecker of A wrote that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with the exterminations and that relations with the 4th Panzer Army, commanded by General Erich Hoepner, were &quot;very close, almost cordial&quot;. In the south, the Romanian Army worked closely with D to massacre Ukrainian Jews, murdering around 26,000 Jews in the Odessa massacre. The German historian Peter Longerich thinks it probable that the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, along with the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), incited the Lviv pogroms, during which 8,500 to 9,000 Jews were murdered by the native population and C in July 1941. Moreover, most people on the home front in Germany had some idea of the massacres being committed by the . British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper noted that although Himmler had forbidden photographs of the murders, it was common for both the men of the and for bystanders to take pictures to send to their loved ones, which he felt suggested widespread approval of the massacres.

Officers in the field were well aware of the killing operations being conducted by the . The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; tried to justify their considerable involvement in the massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.

== &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; trials ==
Most of the surviving perpetrators of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German government only charged about 100 former members with war crimes. As time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and were less likely to be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.

=== 1947–1948 trial ===

After the close of World War II, 24 senior leaders of the were prosecuted in the Einsatzgruppen trial in 1947–48, part of the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials held under United States military authority. The men were charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and membership in the SS (which had been declared a criminal organization). Fourteen death sentences and two life sentences were among the judgments; only four executions were carried out, on 7 June 1951; the rest were reduced to lesser sentences. Four additional leaders were later tried and executed by other nations.

Several leaders, including Ohlendorf, claimed at the trial to have received an order before Operation Barbarossa requiring them to murder all Soviet Jews. To date no evidence has been found that such an order was ever issued. German prosecutor Alfred Streim noted that if such an order had been given, post-war courts would only have been able to convict the leaders as &quot;accomplices&quot; to mass murder. However, if it could be established that the had committed mass murder without orders, then they could have been convicted as &quot;perpetrators&quot; of mass murder, and hence could have received stiffer sentences, including capital punishment.

Streim postulated that the existence of an early comprehensive order was a fabrication created for use in Ohlendorf&#x27;s defence. This theory is now widely accepted by historians. Longerich notes that most orders received by the leaders—especially when they were being ordered to carry out criminal activities—were vague, and couched in terminology that had a specific meaning for members of the regime. Leaders were given briefings about the need to be &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;firm&quot;; all Jews were to be viewed as potential enemies who had to be dealt with ruthlessly. British historian Ian Kershaw argues that Hitler&#x27;s apocalyptic remarks before Barbarossa about the necessity for a war without mercy to &quot;annihilate&quot; the forces of &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; were interpreted by commanders as permission and encouragement to engage in extreme antisemitic violence, with each commander to use his own discretion about how far he was prepared to go. According to Erwin Schulz, one of only two of Ohlendorf&#x27;s codefendants to not attest to his version of events, he only received an order to exterminate all Jews in mid-August 1941. Unlike Ohlendorf, however, Schulz, unwilling to kill women and children, had refused to carry out this order and was subsequently discharged.

Prior to the invasion, Schulz testified that Heydrich had told him:&quot;That every one should be sure to understand that, in this fight, Jews would definitely take their part and that, in this fight, everything was set at stake, and the one side which gave in would be the one to be overcome. For that reason, all measures had to be taken against the Jews in particular. The experience in Poland had shown this.&quot;
===1958 trial===

The crimes of the Einsatzgruppen came into wider public awareness with the Ulm Einsatzkommando trial in 1958. At the trial, ten former members of were on trial accused of murdering around 5,500 Jewish men, women, and children in the German-Lithuanian border area in mid-1941. Among them were the heads of the Tilsit task force , , and the head of the Tilsit SD section . The responsible senior public prosecutor, , used as evidence documents from the American Einsatzgruppen trial in Nuremberg, existing specialist literature, SS personnel files, and surviving &quot;USSR event reports&quot;.

<doc id="510765" wikidata="Q610845" url="?curid=510765" title="British Overseas Territories Act 2002">
<text>The British Overseas Territories Act 2002 (c.8) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which superseded parts of the British Nationality Act 1981. It makes legal provision for the renaming of the &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot; as British Overseas Territories, and the renaming of associated citizenship.

As a result of the act, all who were British Overseas Territories citizens (apart from those solely connected with the Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas) immediately prior to 21 May 2002 &quot;automatically&quot; became full British citizens on that date (previously full British citizenship was either automatically accorded or granted without conditions on request only to people from Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands).

The law was enacted five years after the end of British sovereignty over Hong Kong, whose population had been vastly greater than all other British Dependent Territories put together.

The &quot;qualifying territories&quot; for the purposes of the 2002 Act include the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) and the British Antarctic Territory. At the time, there was discussion as to whether either of these territories should be treated as &quot;qualifying territories&quot; for the purposes of the Act, when neither has a permanent population and in the case of the British Antarctic Territory there are competing territorial claims that are held in abeyance.

Although it is not normally possible under either territory&#x27;s immigration laws to acquire British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC) by naturalization in that territory, the former inhabitants of the BIOT still hold BOTC by virtue of their birth, or a parent&#x27;s birth, in that territory.

Although it was possible for BOTCs to voluntarily acquire British citizenship under the previous provisions of British Nationality Act 1981 through section 4 registration by meeting UK residency and good character requirements prior to 2002, the enactment of the 2002 act means that every BOTC who was not already a British citizen on enactment day automatically acquired that status without satisfying residency and character requirements. This, effectively, means that BOTCs are in a unique position of simultaneously holding two forms of British nationality. The only exception to this are for those connected solely with the sovereign military bases in Cyprus, and those who acquired BOTC status voluntarily (i.e., through naturalization) after 21 May 2002.

This has allowed residents of British Overseas Territories to apply for and travel on a separate British passport describing them as a British citizen, to reside in the UK permanently without being subject to UK immigration control, to join the British armed forces and police forces, and to exercise rights under the Human Rights Act. Although not explicitly stated, the act also granted them EU citizenship through UK&#x27;s membership in the European Union, which (until UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU was finalized) meant that BOTCs with British citizen passports were afforded all rights accorded to EU citizens in any EU country.

South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands was included in the scope of the Act mainly due to its former association with the Falkland Islands. The 2002 Act is similar in scope to the British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 and repealed some of that Act (without affecting the validity of any acquisition of British citizenship under that legislation).

Those naturalizing as British overseas territories citizens after 21 May 2002 may submit an application to be registered as British citizens under section 4A of the 1981 Act, subject only to good character requirements. However, the application must be made voluntarily. Hence, it is still theoretically possible for a person to hold only BOTC status but not British citizenship after 2002, if they had never filed such an application or their application is refused by the UK government.

While BOTCs of all the Overseas Territories (except the Sovereign Base Areas) are now either British citizens or eligible to acquire British citizenship (and therefore gain right of abode in the UK by virtue of being a British citizen), British citizens visiting Overseas Territories are still subject to local immigration controls and are, in most cases, given limited leave to remain by the territory&#x27;s immigration officers.

<text>The National Assembly () is the federal legislature of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, which was first elected in 2000 under the 1999 constitution. It is a unicameral body made up of a variable number of members, who are elected by a &quot;universal, direct, personal, and secret&quot; vote partly by direct election in state-based voting districts, and partly on a state-based party-list proportional representation system. 

Each of the 23 States and the Capital District elects no less than three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country. Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela&#x27;s indigenous peoples and elected separately by all citizens, not just those with indigenous backgrounds. For the 2010 to 2015 the number of seats was 165. 

Deputies to the National Assembly serve a five-year term and may be re-elected for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The National Assembly meets in the Federal Legislative Palace in Venezuela&#x27;s capital, Caracas.

==Legislative history==

===1961 Constitution===

Under its previous , Venezuela had a bicameral legislature, known as the Congress &quot;(Congreso)&quot;. This Congress was composed of a Senate of Venezuela &quot;(Senado)&quot; and a Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies &quot;(Cámara de Diputados)&quot;.

The Senate was made up of two senators per state, two for the Federal District, and a number of &quot;ex officio&quot; senators intended to represent the nation&#x27;s minorities. In addition, former presidents (those elected democratically or their replacements legally appointed to serve at least half a presidential term) were awarded lifetime senate seats.
Senators were required to be Venezuelan-born citizens and over the age of 30.

The members of the Chamber of Deputies were elected by direct universal suffrage, with each state returning at least two. Deputies had to be at least 21 years old.

The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were each led by a President, and both performed their functions with the help of a Directorial Board. The President of Senate of Venezuela held the additional title of &quot;President of the Congress&quot;, and was the constitutional successor of the President of Venezuela in case of a vacancy. This succession took place in 1993, when Octavio Lepage succeeded Carlos Andrés Pérez.

===1999 Constitution===
President Hugo Chávez was first elected in December 1998 on a platform calling for a National Constituent Assembly to be convened to draft a new constitution for Venezuela. Chávez&#x27;s argument was that the existing political system, under the earlier 1961 Constitution, had become isolated from the people. In the Constituent Assembly elections held on 25 July 1999, all but six seats were given to candidates associated with the Chávez movement. The National Constituent Assembly (ANC), consisting of 131 elected individuals, convened in August 1999 to begin rewriting the constitution. The ANC&#x27;s proposed constitution was approved in a referendum on 15 December 1999 and came into effect the following 20 December.

====2017 constitutional crisis====
On 29 March 2017, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ) stripped the elected National Assembly of its constitutional powers, ruling that all powers would be transferred to the Supreme Court. The previous year the court found the assembly in contempt for swearing in legislators whose elections had been deemed invalid by the court. The 2017 court judgement declared that the &quot;situation of contempt&quot; meant that the assembly could not exercise its powers. The action transferred powers from the Assembly, which had an opposition majority since January 2016, to the Supreme Court, which has a majority of government loyalists. The move was denounced by the opposition with Assembly President Julio Borges describing the action as a coup d&#x27;état by President Nicolás Maduro. However, after public protests and condemnation by international bodies, the court&#x27;s decision was reversed a few days later on 1 April.

On 4 August 2017, Venezuela convened a new Constituent National Assembly after a special election which was boycotted by the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) and other opposition parties. The new Constituent Assembly is intended to rewrite the constitution; it also has wide legal powers allowing it to rule above all other state institutions. The Constituent Assembly met within the Federal Legislative Palace; while the leadership of the National Assembly had said it would continue its work as a legislature and it would still continue to meet in the same building.

On 18 August the Constituent Assembly summoned the members of the National Assembly to attend a ceremony acknowledging its legal superiority; the opposition members of the National Assembly boycotted the event. In response, the Constituent Assembly stripped the National Assembly of its legislative powers, assuming them for itself. It justified the move by claiming that the National Assembly had failed to prevent what it called &quot;opposition violence&quot; in the form of the 2017 Venezuelan protests. The constitutionality of this move has been questioned, and it has been condemned by several foreign governments and international bodies.

==== 2020 contested leadership election ====

The 2020 Venezuelan National Assembly Delegated Committee election of 5 January, to elect the Board of Directors of the National Assembly was disrupted. The events resulted in two competing claims for the Presidency of the National Assembly: one by deputy Luis Parra and one by Juan Guaidó. Parra was formerly a member of Justice First, but was expelled from the party on 20 December 2019 based on corruption allegations, which he denies. From inside the legislature, Parra declared himself president of the National Assembly; a move that was welcomed by Maduro administration. The opposition disputed this outcome, saying that quorum had not been achieved and no votes had been counted. Police forces had blocked access to parliament to some opposition members, including Guaidó, and members of the media. Later in the day, a separate session was carried out at the headquarters of &quot;El Nacional&quot; newspaper, where 100 of the 167 deputies voted to re-elect Guaidó as president of the parliament. In his speech, Guaidó announced his resignation from Popular Will.

Guaidó was sworn in a session on 7 January after forcing his way in through police barricades. Parra has reiterated his claim to the presidency of the parliament.

==Membership==
Any Venezuelan citizen by birth or naturalization, with at least fifteen years of residence in Venezuelan territory, who is 21 years of age or older, is eligible to be elected as a deputy to the National Assembly. However, the same person cannot hold the office of President or Vice President of the Republic, Minister, Secretary of the Presidency, or hold senior positions in Autonomous Institutes or State-owned companies, until three months after leaving these positions. Additionally, state governors, secretaries of government, and other officials at the municipal, state, or national level in the jurisdiction where the election takes place are also ineligible unless holding accidental, assistance, teaching, or academic positions.

A deputy of the National Assembly cannot own, manage, or direct companies that contract with state entities, nor can they manage private lucrative interests with such entities. Deputies are obliged to abstain from voting on issues where they have an economic conflict of interest. Moreover, they are not allowed to accept or exercise other public offices without losing their status as deputies, except for teaching, academic, or assistance activities that do not require full-time dedication.

==Structure and powers==
Under the current Bolivarian 1999 Constitution, the legislative branch of Government in Venezuela is represented by a unicameral National Assembly. The Assembly is currently made up of 277 seats&quot;.&quot; Officials are elected by &quot;universal, direct, personal, and secret&quot; vote on a national party-list proportional representation system. In addition, three deputies are returned on a state-by-state basis, and three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela&#x27;s indigenous peoples.

All deputies serve five-year terms and must appoint a replacement &quot;(suplente)&quot; to stand in for them during periods of incapacity or absence. Under the 1999 constitution deputies could be reelected on up to two terms (Art. 192); under the 2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum these term limits were removed. Deputies must be Venezuelan citizens by birth, or naturalized Venezuelans with a period of residency in excess of 15 years; older than 21 on the day of the election; and have lived in the state for which they seek election during the previous four years (Art. 188).

Beyond passing legislation (and being able to block any of the president&#x27;s legislative initiatives), the National Assembly has a number of specific powers outlined in Article 187, including approving the budget, initiating impeachment proceedings against most government officials (including ministers and the Vice President, but not the President, who can only be removed through a recall referendum) and appointing the members of the electoral, judicial, and prosecutor&#x27;s branches of government. Among others it also has the power to authorize foreign and domestic military action and to authorize the President to leave the national territory for more than 5 days.

The Assembly is led by a President with 2 Vice Presidents, and together with a secretary and an assistant secretary, they form the Assembly Board of Directors (BoD-NAVEN), and when it is on recess twice a year, they lead a Standing Commission of the National Assembly together with 28 other MPs.

Since 2010 the Assembly&#x27;s 15 Permanent Committees, created by the 2010 Assembly Rules, are composed by MPs (ranging from the minimum of 7 to the maximum of 25) tackling legislation of various issues. The Committees&#x27; offices are housed in the José María Vargas Building in Caracas, few hundred yards from the Federal Legislative Palace, the former building is also where the offices of the Assembly leadership are located.

==Electoral system==
In the 2000 Venezuelan parliamentary election, representatives were elected under a mixed member proportional representation, with 60% elected in single seat districts and the remainder by closed party list proportional representation. This was an adaptation of the system previously used for the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies, which had been introduced in 1993, with a 50-50 balance between single seat districts and party lists, and deputies per state proportional to population, but with a minimum of three deputies per state.

==Political composition==
The first election of deputies to the new National Assembly took place on 30 July 2000. President Hugo Chávez&#x27; Fifth Republic Movement won 92 seats (56%). The opposition did not participate in the 2005 elections, and as a result gained no seats, while the Fifth Republic Movement gained 114 (69%). In 2007 a number of parties, including the Fifth Republic Movement, merged to create the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which in January 2009 held 139 of the 169 seats (82%). In the 2010 election, for which the number of deputies was reduced to 165, the PSUV won 96 seats (58%), the opposition electoral coalition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) 65, and Patria Para Todos won 2.

At the 2015 parliamentary election, the MUD won 109 of the 164 general seats and all three indigenous seats, which gave them a supermajority in the National Assembly; while the government&#x27;s own coalition, the Great Patriotic Pole (GPP), won the remaining 55 seats. Voter turnout exceeded 70 percent.

The result, however, was marred by the January 2016 suspension from the National Assembly by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of 4 elected members of Parliament (MPs) from Amazonas state due to alleged voter fraud and election irregularities. 3 of the 4 were opposition deputies and one was from the government&#x27;s coalition (GPP). 

Following the 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election the new Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly was inaugurated which has the power to rule over all other state institutions and rewrite the constitution. As of May 2019, the Constituent Assembly mandate is expected to expire on 31 December 2020 (after next National Assembly elections), a measure that replaces the previous resolution of August 2017 that established its validity for at least two years.

In 2020, Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela and allied parties claimed to have captured 67 percent of seats in the National Assembly, but that election was also disputed by EU and U.S. officials. Nevertheless, since then Maduro has exercised majority control of the Venezuelan parliament, displacing Juan Guaidó from his oppositional presidency.

<text>Bihar was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary and a county of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom and Principality of Transylvania (since the 16th century, when it was under the rule of the Princes of Transylvania). Most of its territory is now part of Romania, while a smaller western part belongs to Hungary. The capital of the county was Nagyvárad (now Oradea in Romania). Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s father was from this county.

== Geography ==

Bihar County was situated along the upper courses of the rivers Körös, Sebes-Körös, Fekete-Körös and Berettyó. The medieval county also included &quot;Kalotaszeg&quot; region (now Țara Călatei in Romania). The total territory of the medieval county was around .

After 1876, Bihar county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Békés, Hajdú, Szabolcs, Szatmár, Szilágy, Kolozs, Torda-Aranyos and Arad. The western half of the county was in the Pannonian plain, while the eastern half was part of the Apuseni mountains (Erdélyi-középhegység). Its area was around 1910, making it the third largest county of Hungary.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The origin of the name of Bihar is uncertain, however more theories exist. It could take its name from an ancient fortress in the current commune of Biharia. Or, the Hungarian Bihar derived from the word vihar (tempest, storm), that is of Slavic origin; vihor (whirlwind). A less probable theory is that Biharea is of Daco-Thracian etymology (&quot;bi&quot;meaning &quot;two&quot; and &quot;harati&quot; &quot;take&quot; or &quot;lead&quot;), possibly meaning two possessions of land in the Duchy of Menumorut.

In the 730s the Khazar Khaganate was ruled by Bihar Khagan, called Viharos in Armenian sources. “Viharos” is a currently used Hungarian word meaning stormy.

The castle of &quot;Byhor&quot;, or Bihar (now Biharia in Romania), was the center of the duchy of Menumorut at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin in the 890s, according to the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;. The &quot;Gesta&quot;—the only primary source which mentions Menumorut—describes him as a ruler &quot;with Bulgarian heart&quot; who was the vassal of the Byzantine Emperor. Menumorut&#x27;s subjects were Khazars, and the Székelys joined the invading Hungarians in his duchy. Historian Tudor Sălăgean writes that other peoples (including Romanians) must have also lived in Menumorut&#x27;s realm. Menumorut was forced to give his daughter in marriage to Zoltán, son of Árpád, Grand Prince of the Hungarians. When he died, his son-in-law inherited his duchy. Modern scholars debate whether Menumorut and his duchy actually existed or the anonymous author of the &quot;Gesta&quot; invented them. For instance, historian György Györffy says that Menumorut&#x27;s name preserved the memory of the Moravians who dominated parts of the Carpathian Basin in the . According to historians György Györffy and Victor Spinei, the presence of Kabars in the region could have given rise to Anonymous&#x27; reference to Menumorut&#x27;s &quot;Khazars&quot;.

Place names of Slavic origin—for instance, &quot;Zomlyn&quot; (near modern Darvas in Hungary), Csatár and Szalacs (now Cetariu and Sălacea in Romania)—show that Slav communities lived along the rivers Ér and Berettyó and around Bihar. Graves of 10th-century warriors, buried together with parts of their horses, have been excavated, for instance, at Bihar, Hajdúböszörmény, and Nagyszalonta (now Salonta in Romania). According to archaeologist Thomas Nägler, the small number of graves which can be attributed to 10th-century Hungarian warriors shows that few Hungarians settled in the region after the Hungarian conquest. Archaeologist Erwin Gáll writes that the cemetery at Bihar may represent a &quot;peripheral centre&quot; of a core region which was located along the upper courses of the river Tisza, because the burial customs were similar in the two territories. Almost a dozen medieval villages—for instance, Felkér, Köröskisjenő and Köröstarján (now Felcheriu, Ineu and Tărian in Romania)—bore the name of a Hungarian tribe, suggesting that Hungarian groups settled in the region in the late 10th and early , according to György Györffy.

Written sources and toponyms implies the presence of Székelys. The castle folk of &quot;Ebey&quot;—a village, located near Nagyszalonta, which was later abandoned—were grouped into a &quot;hundred&quot;, or &quot;centurionatus&quot;, named Székelyszáz around 1217. The Seat of Telegd was most probably named after the village Telegd (now Tileagd in Romania). If this scholarly theory is valid, the ancestors of the Székelys of Telegd had lived in Bihar County before they moved to eastern Transylvania. Historian Florin Curta writes that the Székelys settled in the county only in the early .

Modern historians agree that the county was established between 1020 and 1050, most probably by Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, or possibly by his successor, Peter. According to a version of a royal charter, issued in 1203, mentioned that &quot;the whole Bihar County&quot; was located partly around Bihar and partly around Zaránd (now Zărand in Romania), suggesting that Bihar County had originally included Zaránd County, or at least its territories north of the river Fehér-Körös. Another version of the same charter also mentioned Békés besides Bihar and Zaránd, implying that Bihar County had also included the lands which developed into the separate Békés County.

=== Middle Ages ===

The 11th-century Bihar Castle, made of earth and timber, was the first center of the county. The earliest royal charter that mentioned the &quot;ispán&quot;, or head, of the county was issued around 1067. The county was included in the &quot;ducatus&quot;, or duchy, that Andrew I of Hungary granted to his younger brother, Béla, around 1050. Béla&#x27;s son, Géza, ruled the duchy from 1064. Nomadic Turks—Pechenegs or Ouzes—plundered the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the region around Bihar Castle in 1068. Duke Géza, his brother, Ladislaus, and their cousin, King Solomon of Hungary, joined their forces and chased the marauders as far as Doboka (now Dăbâca in Romania). Six years later, &quot;the troops from &quot;Byhor&quot;&quot; were under the command of Duke Ladislaus in the Battle of Mogyoród which ended with the decisive victory of Géza and Ladislaus over King Solomon. The first document that mentioned the county was issued in 1075.

According to György Györffy, the county seems to have originally been included in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Eger, because the Deanery of Zsomboly, located to the south of Bihar County, formed an exclave of the Eger bishopric during the Middle Ages. The separate Roman Catholic Diocese of Bihar was set up between 1020 and 1061. Its see was transferred to Várad (now Oradea in Romania) before 1095. There were four deaneries in the county; the Deanery of Bihar was the first to have been documented (in 1213). Pilgrims frequented the shrine of King St Ladislaus in the Várad Cathedral after his canonization in 1192 and trials by ordeal were also held there.

Emeric, King of Hungary approached Pope Innocent III, asking him to make &quot;Latins&quot; abbot of the Greek monasteries in the Kingdom of Hungary to restore discipline. In a letter, written on 16 May 1204, the pope ordered Simon, the Catholic Bishop of Várad to visit the &quot;Greek&quot; monasteries and to set up a separate diocese, directly subjected to the Holy See, for them. According to historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, those &quot;Greek&quot; monasteries actually belonged to the local Orthodox Romanians&#x27;. Pop also writes that the Orthodox bishopric &quot;in the country of Knez Bela&quot;, mentioned in a letter that Pope Innocent wrote to the Archbishop of Kalocsa in 1205, was located north of Oradea.

At least 19 villages—including Köröskisjenő, Mezőgyán and Mezősas in Bihar County, and Gyulavarsánd and Vadász (now Vărșand and Vânători) in Zaránd County—made up the honour of Bihar Castle in the early . The &quot;Várad Register&quot;—a codex which preserved the minutes of hundreds of ordeals held at the Várad Chapter between 1208 and 1235—provides information of the life of the commoners in the honour. The castle folk who were divided in &quot;hundreds&quot; provided well-specified services to the &quot;ispán&quot;. The &quot;Register&quot; mentioned the gatekeepers and the hunters of Bihar Castle. The &quot;Register&quot; also referred to &quot;guest settlers&quot; of foreign—Rus&#x27;, German or &quot;Latin&quot;—origin. For instance, Walloon &quot;guests&quot; established Olaszi near Várad (now Olasig neighborhood in Oradea) before 1215.

The kings started to give away parcels of the royal domain already in the . Prelates and ecclesiastic institutions—including the bishops of Várad, the Dömös Chapter and the Garamszentbenedek Abbey—were the first beneficiaries. According to György Györffy, the noble Ákos, Borsa, Gutkeled and Hont-Pázmány clans received their first estates in the county in the ; the Geregyes, the Telegdis and most other lords only in the late . The western and southwestern lowlands were distributed among dozens of noble families, each holding only one village.

The Mongols captured and destroyed Várad during their invasion of Hungary in 1241, according to Roger of Torre Maggiore, who was archdeacon of the Várad Chapter at that time. At least 18% of the nearly 170 settlements documented in the county before 1241 disappeared during the Mongol invasion. Stephen V of Hungary exempted the peasants living in the estates of the bishop of Várad of royal taxation and granted the bishop the right to open mines in his estates in 1263 to promote the economic recovery of the bishopric. A silver mine was in short opened at the bishop&#x27;s domains at Belényes (now Beiuș in Romania).

New fortresses were built during the decades following the withdrawal of the Mongols. Judge royal Paul Geregye erected Sólyomkő Castle at Élesd (now Aleșd in Romania); his sons held further 2 newly built fortresses in the 1270s. Their power was crushed during King Ladislaus the Cuman&#x27;s reign; he granted their fortresses and domains to the Borsas. James Borsa, one of the semi-independent &quot;oligarchs&quot;, was the actual ruler of Bihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, Szatmár and Szolnok counties in the early . After James Borsa&#x27;s fall in the late 1310s, the noble Czibak, Debreceni and Telegdi families became the wealthiest lay landowners in the county. The center of the Debrecenis&#x27; ancestral estates, Debrecen, developed into a market town.

One of the earliest references to the presence of Romanians in the county—the place name &quot;Olahteluk&quot; (&quot;Vlachs&#x27; Plot&quot;)—was recorded in a non-authentic charter, dated to 1283. The first authentic document mentioning Romanians was issued in 1293. They lived in the region of the bishop&#x27;s castle at Várasfenes (now Finiș in Romania). Next a charter of 1326 referred to the Romanian Voivode Neagul who &quot;settled and lived&quot; &quot;(considet and commoratur)&quot; in Nicholas Telegdi&#x27;s estate at Káptalanhodos (now Hodiş in Romania). Historian Ioan Aurel Pop writes that the latter charter proves that Nicholas Telegdi&#x27;s estate had originally owned by Voivode Neagul.

=== Modern Times ===

Soon after the Battle of Mohács in 1526 the Kingdom of Hungary was partitioned; the county&#x27;s territory became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, then from 1570 the Principality of Transylvania. A large part of it was ruled by the Ottoman Empire as Varat Eyalet between 1660–1692, before it became part of the Kingdom of Hungary again. Within Hungary Bihar was part of the (&#x27;district/circle beyond the Tisza&#x27;; ), one of four such districts; in the early 19th century this district also contained eleven other counties: Máramaros, Ugocsa, Szatmár, Szabolcs, Békés, Csongrád, Csanád, Arad and the three Banat counties of Krassó, Temes and Torontál.

Following the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, in 1850 Bihar was provisionally partitioned into and (Upper- and Lower-Bihar) as part of the District of Großwardein. These later became and (South- and North-Bihar). The border between and mostly followed the Berettyó/Barcău river. was centred on the of Großwardein (, ) and also included the (districts) of Ártánd, Élesd, Margita, Szalonta, Belényes and Tenke. was centred on the and of Debreczin and also included the of Dorogh, Diószegh, Derecske and Püspök-Ladány. Part of &#x27;s territory had previously belonged to the Hajdúság (see Hajdú County) and Szabolcs County. The pre-1848 counties of Hungary, including Bihar, were restored in October 1860.

In 1876 the Kingdom of Hungary was divided into seven Circles, with a total of 64 counties. The Circle on the left bank of the Tisza contained eight counties, including Bihar, with the other seven being Békés, Hajdú, Máramaros, Szabolcs, Szatmár, Szilágy and Ugocsa. Bihar county in the Austro-Hungarian Empire contained Debrecen and Nagyvárad.

In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon about 75% of the county became part of Romania. The west of the county remained in Hungary. The capital of this smaller county Bihar was Berettyóújfalu. In 1940, by the Second Vienna Award, the county&#x27;s territory have been extended by its former parts gained from Romania.

In 1950, the Hungarian county Bihar was merged with Hajdú County to form Hajdú-Bihar county. The southernmost part of Hungarian Bihar (the area around Sarkad and Okány) went to Békés County.

The Romanian part of former Bihar County now forms the Romanian Bihor County, except the southernmost part (around Beliu), which is in Arad County.

<text>The USS &quot;St. Andrews&quot; (CVE-49) (originally AVG-49, later ACV-49) was assigned to MC hull 260 on 23 August 1942, a ship to be built to modified C3-S-A1 plans. She was laid down on 12 March 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Tacoma, Washington; redesignated CVE-49 on 15 July; and launched on 31 July; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Morse; transferred to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 7 December; and commissioned the same day as HMS &quot;Queen&quot; (D19) in the Royal Navy.

HMS &quot;Queen&quot; served British and Allied escort forces in protecting the vital convoy supply effort across the North Atlantic in 1944, and in the Pacific campaigns in 1945. On 4 May 1945 aircraft of &quot;Queen&quot;″s 853 Squadron, Fleet Air Arm, took part in Operation Judgement, the last air-raid of the European war, at Kilbotn, Norway. After hostilities ceased, she was converted to a troop carrier and used to bring British forces back from the Far East, before being returned to the United States at Norfolk, Virginia, 31 October 1946.

On arrival, &quot;Queen&quot; was decommissioned by the Royal Navy and was taken over by the U.S. Navy. In excess of Navy needs, CVE-49 was slated, in December, for disposal; struck from the Navy Register in July 1947, sold to the N.V. Stoomv, Maats, Nederland Co., Amsterdam, Netherlands and pressed into merchant service as &quot;Roebiah&quot; on 29 July 1947 (renamed &quot;President Marcos&quot; in 1967 and &quot;Lucky One&quot; in 1972). She was scrapped in Taiwan in 1972.

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided a steam turbine, two boilers connected to one shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>Yolande Thibeault (born October 8, 1939) is a Canadian politician and journalist who was elected a member of Parliament of the House of Commons of Canada for the Saint-Lambert Riding in the 1997 general election. She was re-elected in the 2000 election with considerable majority over other candidates.

Thibeault was born on October 8, 1939, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She is a former freelance journalist for the Canadian Press. She also volunteered as assistant to the Chief Organizer of the NO committee in Saint-Lambert during the 1995 Quebec referendum, and was a volunteer on the YES committee during the 1992 Charlottetown Accord referendum. She served as Co-Chair for Jacques Saada&#x27;s federal election campaign in the 1993 election, and was &quot;city leader&quot; for the Quebec Liberal Party in Saint-Lambert for the 1994 provincial election.

During her first mandate as Member of Parliament (MP), she was assistant deputy chair of the Committees of the Whole House. For her second term, she was vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, a member of the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities, chair of the Prime Minister&#x27;s caucus Task Force on Seniors, chair of the Canada-Germany Friendship Group, chair of the Canada-Cyprus Friendship Group, executive member of the Canada-France Inter-Parliamentary Association, and executive member of Canada-Africa Parliamentary Group.

She won the Liberal nomination for Saint-Lambert in 2004 against Carole Marcil. She was subsequently defeated in the election of 2004, losing by 5,370 votes to Cameroonian-born sovereigntist Maka Kotto of the Bloc Québecois. Thibault&#x27;s defeat was remarkable because the riding had been considered a &quot;Liberal fortress.&quot;

<doc id="510778" wikidata="Q7819266" url="?curid=510778" title="Tommy Burks">
<text>Fred Thomas Burks (May 22, 1940 – October 19, 1998) was a farmer and Democratic Party politician in Tennessee, United States. He served in the Tennessee House of Representatives from 1970 until 1978 and in the Tennessee State Senate from 1978 until his assassination in 1998.

==Biography==
Born in Cookeville, Tennessee, Burks was one of the most conservative Democrats in the state legislature. He was very conservative even by Tennessee Democratic standards of the time, opposing the teaching of evolution in school science classes (twice introducing legislation to restrict its teaching), legal abortion, gambling, and a state lottery. His views seemed to have been very popular and in line with a large number of voters within his rural district.

Burks was an energetic legislator who almost never missed a floor or committee session. He reportedly would on some occasions arrive at a session having already gotten up on his farm, delivered a load of hogs to Knoxville (about 90 miles east of his home), and then driven to the State Capitol in Nashville (100 miles west of his home and 190 miles west of Knoxville). Despite the 100-mile distance, and unlike most legislators from parts of the state a considerable distance from Nashville, Burks made it a practice to go home to his district and his farm almost every night, even during legislative sessions.

==Death==
Burks was shot dead by his Republican Party opponent, Byron Looper, on Burks&#x27;s own property before the next election. An eyewitness to the murder helped seal the conviction of Looper, who was, at the time, Putnam County tax assessor. Burks&#x27; widow, Charlotte, ran for his seat and won, becoming the first Tennessee state senator and one of very few American politicians to win as a write-in candidate. She was re-elected in 2002, 2006, and 2010. The gun used to kill Burks was found by a highway work crew near Highway 111 and Interstate 40, and is believed to have been thrown out of Looper&#x27;s car window along I-40 between Monterey and Cookeville following the murder.

Interstate 40 through Wilson, Smith, Putnam, and Cumberland Counties is named the Tommy Burks Memorial Highway.

<doc id="510786" wikidata="Q5634146" url="?curid=510786" title="HMS Ruler">
<text>HMS &quot;Ruler was the [[lead ship]] of [[Ruler-class escort carrier|her class]] of [[escort carrier]] of the [[Royal Navy during the Second World War]]. She was built in the United States as the carrier St. Joseph&quot; (AVG/CVE/ACV-50) for Lend-Lease to the United Kingdom.

==Construction==
The name &quot;St. Joseph&quot; (making her the first United States Navy ship named for St. Joseph Bay, Florida) was assigned to MC hull 261, a converted C3-S-A1 cargo ship, on 23 August 1942. She was laid down on 25 March 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Tacoma, Washington. She was redesignated CVE-50 on 15 July, launched on 21 August 1943 and sponsored by Mrs. W.W. Smyth. The carrier was transferred to the United Kingdom on 22 December 1943 and commissioned into Royal Navy service the same day as HMS &quot;Ruler&quot;, with the pennant number D72.

==Operational history==
After completing sea trials HMS &quot;Ruler&quot; went to Burrard Dry Dock, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, for refit to Royal Navy standards, as a transport carrier. Following a work-up period HMS &quot;Ruler&quot; went to Norfolk, Virginia, via the Panama Canal. It departed on 20 April 1944 with a number of Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair, transferring them to RNAS Speke in Liverpool, England, the aircraft disembarking on 6 May 1944. HMS &quot;Ruler&quot; returned to the United States, to New York, to fetch a batch of Grumman TBF Avenger and Grumman F6F Hellcat aircraft, embarking them between the 20 and 23 May 1944 and again transferring to RNAS Speke, on 11 June. HMS &quot;Ruler&quot; later made a third trip, fetching Grumman F6F Hellcat and Vought F4U Corsair from Norfolk, Virginia, between 20 and 29 October, this time arriving at Greenock to unload on 18 November.

HMS &quot;Ruler&quot; served in the North Atlantic during 1944, protecting the vital flow of men and war from the United States to Great Britain and to fighting fronts on the European continent. In early 1945, she transferred to the Pacific Theatre where she supported a raid on Truk and the campaign to take Okinawa.

From March to August 1945 was part of the British Pacific Fleet attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron. She entered Tokyo Bay on 31 August 1945 prior to the Surrender of Japan. On 13 September, the ship brought onboard some 450 ex Prisoners of War and sailed for Sydney in Australia, arriving 27 September where she was greeted by the Governor-General of Australia, Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester.

After the war ended, &quot;Ruler&quot; returned to the United States at Norfolk, Virginia, on 28 January 1946. She was decommissioned from RN service on 29 January, and was accepted by the US Navy the same day. In excess of the Navy’s needs, she was slated for disposal and struck from the Navy Register on 20 March 1946. The ship was sold on 13 May and scrapped within the year.

==Design and description==
These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. The ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two boilers which were connected to a steam turbine; it drove a shaft giving 9,350 brake horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge/flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. &quot;Ruler&quot;″s armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. Each ship had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlets, Vought F4U Corsairs or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine torpedo bombers.

<doc id="510791" wikidata="Q2607828" url="?curid=510791" title="List of cognitive biases">
<text>Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm and/or rationality in judgment. They are often studied in psychology, sociology and behavioral economics.

Although the reality of most of these biases is confirmed by reproducible research, there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them. Several theoretical causes are known for some cognitive biases, which provides a classification of biases by their common generative mechanism (such as noisy information-processing). Gerd Gigerenzer has criticized the framing of cognitive biases as errors in judgment, and favors interpreting them as arising from rational deviations from logical thought.

Explanations include information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called &quot;heuristics&quot;, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive (&quot;cold&quot;) bias, such as mental noise, or motivational (&quot;hot&quot;) bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill; a way to establish a connection with the other person.

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some studies have found bias in non-human animals as well. For example, loss aversion has been shown in monkeys and hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.

== Belief, decision-making and behavioral ==
These biases affect belief formation, reasoning processes, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general.

=== Anchoring bias ===

The anchoring bias, or focalism, is the tendency to rely too heavily—to &quot;anchor&quot;—on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).
Anchoring bias includes or involves the following:
* Common source bias, the tendency to combine or compare research studies from the same source, or from sources that use the same methodologies or data.
* Conservatism bias, the tendency to insufficiently revise one&#x27;s belief when presented with new evidence.
* Functional fixedness, a tendency limiting a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used.
* Law of the instrument, an over-reliance on a familiar tool or methods, ignoring or under-valuing alternative approaches. &quot;If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&quot;

=== Apophenia ===

The tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things.
The following are types of apophenia:
* Clustering illusion, the tendency to overestimate the importance of small runs, streaks, or clusters in large samples of random data (that is, seeing phantom patterns).
* Illusory correlation, a tendency to inaccurately perceive a relationship between two unrelated events.
* Pareidolia, a tendency to perceive a vague and random stimulus (often an image or sound) as significant, e.g., seeing images of animals or faces in clouds, the man in the Moon, and hearing non-existent hidden messages on records played in reverse.

=== Availability heuristic ===

The availability heuristic (also known as the availability bias) is the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater &quot;availability&quot; in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be. The availability heuristic includes or involves the following:
* Anthropocentric thinking, the tendency to use human analogies as a basis for reasoning about other, less familiar, biological phenomena.
* Anthropomorphism is characterization of animals, objects, and abstract concepts as possessing human traits, emotions, or intentions. The opposite bias, of not attributing feelings or thoughts to another person, is dehumanised perception, a type of objectification.
* Attentional bias, the tendency of perception to be affected by recurring thoughts.
* Frequency illusion or Baader–Meinhof phenomenon. The frequency illusion is that once something has been noticed then every instance of that thing is noticed, leading to the belief it has a high frequency of occurrence (a form of selection bias). The Baader–Meinhof phenomenon is the illusion where something that has recently come to one&#x27;s attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards. It was named after an incidence of frequency illusion in which the Baader–Meinhof Group was mentioned.
* Implicit association, where the speed with which people can match words depends on how closely they are associated.
* Salience bias, the tendency to focus on items that are more prominent or emotionally striking and ignore those that are unremarkable, even though this difference is often irrelevant by objective standards. See also von Restorff effect.
* Selection bias, which happens when the members of a statistical sample are not chosen completely at random, which leads to the sample not being representative of the population.
* Survivorship bias, which is concentrating on the people or things that &quot;survived&quot; some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility.
* Quantification bias, the tendency to ascribe more weight to measured/quantified metrics than to unquantifiable values. See also: McNamara fallacy.
* Well travelled road effect, the tendency to underestimate the duration taken to traverse oft-travelled routes and overestimate the duration taken to traverse less familiar routes.

=== Cognitive dissonance ===

Cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory information and the mental toll of it.
* Normalcy bias, a form of cognitive dissonance, is the refusal to plan for, or react to, a disaster which has never happened before.
* Effort justification is a person&#x27;s tendency to attribute greater value to an outcome if they had to put effort into achieving it. This can result in more value being applied to an outcome than it actually has. An example of this is the IKEA effect, the tendency for people to place a disproportionately high value on objects that they partially assembled themselves, such as furniture from IKEA, regardless of the quality of the end product.
* Ben Franklin effect, where a person who has performed a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person than they would be if they had &quot;received&quot; a favor from that person.

=== Confirmation bias ===

Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one&#x27;s preconceptions. There are multiple other cognitive biases which involve or are types of confirmation bias:
* Backfire effect, a tendency to react to disconfirming evidence by strengthening one&#x27;s previous beliefs.
* Congruence bias, the tendency to test hypotheses exclusively through direct testing, instead of testing possible alternative hypotheses.
* Experimenter&#x27;s or expectation bias, the tendency for experimenters to believe, certify, and publish data that agree with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve, discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to conflict with those expectations.
* Observer-expectancy effect, when a researcher expects a given result and therefore unconsciously manipulates an experiment or misinterprets data in order to find it (see also subject-expectancy effect).
* Selective perception, the tendency for expectations to affect perception.
* Semmelweis reflex, the tendency to reject new evidence that contradicts a paradigm.

=== Egocentric bias ===

Egocentric bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on one&#x27;s own perspective and/or have a different perception of oneself relative to others. The following are forms of egocentric bias:
* Bias blind spot, the tendency to see oneself as less biased than other people, or to be able to identify more cognitive biases in others than in oneself.
* False consensus effect, the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which others agree with them.
* False uniqueness bias, the tendency of people to see their projects and themselves as more singular than they actually are.
* Forer effect or Barnum effect, the tendency for individuals to give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, graphology, and some types of personality tests.
* Illusion of asymmetric insight, where people perceive their knowledge of their peers to surpass their peers&#x27; knowledge of them.
* Illusion of control, the tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s degree of influence over other external events.
* Illusion of transparency, the tendency for people to overestimate the degree to which their personal mental state is known by others, and to overestimate how well they understand others&#x27; personal mental states.
* Illusion of validity, the tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one&#x27;s judgments, especially when available information is consistent or inter-correlated.
* Illusory superiority, the tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s desirable qualities, and underestimate undesirable qualities, relative to other people. (Also known as &quot;Lake Wobegon effect&quot;, &quot;better-than-average effect&quot;, or &quot;superiority bias&quot;.)
* Naïve cynicism, expecting more egocentric bias in others than in oneself.
* Naïve realism, the belief that we see reality as it really is—objectively and without bias; that the facts are plain for all to see; that rational people will agree with us; and that those who do not are either uninformed, lazy, irrational, or biased.
* Overconfidence effect, a tendency to have excessive confidence in one&#x27;s own answers to questions. For example, for certain types of questions, answers that people rate as &quot;99% certain&quot; turn out to be wrong 40% of the time.
* Planning fallacy, the tendency for people to underestimate the time it will take them to complete a given task.
* Restraint bias, the tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s ability to show restraint in the face of temptation.
* Trait ascription bias, the tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality, behavior, and mood while viewing others as much more predictable.
* Third-person effect, a tendency to believe that mass-communicated media messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves.

=== Extension neglect ===

Extension neglect occurs where the quantity of the sample size is not sufficiently taken into consideration when assessing the outcome, relevance or judgement. The following are forms of extension neglect:
* Base rate fallacy or base rate neglect, the tendency to ignore general information and focus on information only pertaining to the specific case, even when the general information is more important.
* Compassion fade, the tendency to behave more compassionately towards a small number of identifiable victims than to a large number of anonymous ones.
* Conjunction fallacy, the tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than a more general version of those same conditions.
* Duration neglect, the neglect of the duration of an episode in determining its value.
* Hyperbolic discounting, where discounting is the tendency for people to have a stronger preference for more immediate payoffs relative to later payoffs. Hyperbolic discounting leads to choices that are inconsistent over time—people make choices today that their future selves would prefer not to have made, despite using the same reasoning. Also known as current moment bias or present bias, and related to Dynamic inconsistency. A good example of this is a study showed that when making food choices for the coming week, 74% of participants chose fruit, whereas when the food choice was for the current day, 70% chose chocolate.
* Insensitivity to sample size, the tendency to under-expect variation in small samples.
* Less-is-better effect, the tendency to prefer a smaller set to a larger set judged separately, but not jointly.
* Neglect of probability, the tendency to completely disregard probability when making a decision under uncertainty.
* Scope neglect or scope insensitivity, the tendency to be insensitive to the size of a problem when evaluating it. For example, being willing to pay as much to save 2,000 children or 20,000 children.
* Zero-risk bias, the preference for reducing a small risk to zero over a greater reduction in a larger risk.

=== False priors ===

False priors are initial beliefs and knowledge which interfere with the unbiased evaluation of factual evidence and lead to incorrect conclusions. Biases based on false priors include:
* Agent detection bias, the inclination to presume the purposeful intervention of a sentient or intelligent agent.
* Automation bias, the tendency to depend excessively on automated systems which can lead to erroneous automated information overriding correct decisions.
* Gender bias, a widespread set of implicit biases that discriminate against a gender. For example, the assumption that women are less suited to jobs requiring high intellectual ability. Or the assumption that people or animals are male in the absence of any indicators of gender.
* Sexual overperception bias, the tendency to overestimate sexual interest of another person in oneself, and sexual underperception bias, the tendency to underestimate it.
* Stereotyping, expecting a member of a group to have certain characteristics without having actual information about that individual.

=== Framing effect ===

The framing effect is the tendency to draw different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented. Forms of the framing effect include:
* Contrast effect, the enhancement or reduction of a certain stimulus&#x27;s perception when compared with a recently observed, contrasting object.
* Decoy effect, where preferences for either option A or B change in favor of option B when option C is presented, which is completely dominated by option B (inferior in all respects) and partially dominated by option A.
* Default effect, the tendency to favor the default option when given a choice between several options.
* Denomination effect, the tendency to spend more money when it is denominated in small amounts (e.g., coins) rather than large amounts (e.g., bills).
* Distinction bias, the tendency to view two options as more dissimilar when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them separately.
* Domain neglect bias, the tendency to neglect relevant domain knowledge while solving interdisciplinary problems.
* Context neglect bias, the tendency to neglect the human context of technological challenges 

=== Logical fallacy ===

* Berkson&#x27;s paradox, the tendency to misinterpret statistical experiments involving conditional probabilities.
* Escalation of commitment, irrational escalation, or sunk cost fallacy, where people justify increased investment in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence suggesting that the decision was probably wrong.
* G. I. Joe fallacy, the tendency to think that knowing about cognitive bias is enough to overcome it.
* Gambler&#x27;s fallacy, the tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the law of large numbers. For example, &quot;I&#x27;ve flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads.&quot;
* Hot-hand fallacy (also known as &quot;hot hand phenomenon&quot; or &quot;hot hand&quot;), the belief that a person who has experienced success with a random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.
* Plan continuation bias, failure to recognize that the original plan of action is no longer appropriate for a changing situation or for a situation that is different from anticipated.
* Subadditivity effect, the tendency to judge the probability of the whole to be less than the probabilities of the parts.
* Time-saving bias, a tendency to underestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively low speed, and to overestimate the time that could be saved (or lost) when increasing (or decreasing) from a relatively high speed.
* Zero-sum bias, where a situation is incorrectly perceived to be like a zero-sum game (i.e., one person gains at the expense of another).

=== Prospect theory ===
The following relate to prospect theory:
* Ambiguity effect, the tendency to avoid options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown.
* Disposition effect, the tendency to sell an asset that has accumulated in value and resist selling an asset that has declined in value.
* Dread aversion, just as losses yield double the emotional impact of gains, dread yields double the emotional impact of savouring.
* Endowment effect, the tendency for people to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.
* Loss aversion, where the perceived disutility of giving up an object is greater than the utility associated with acquiring it. (see also Sunk cost fallacy)
* Pseudocertainty effect, the tendency to make risk-averse choices if the expected outcome is positive, but make risk-seeking choices to avoid negative outcomes.
* Status quo bias, the tendency to prefer things to stay relatively the same.
* System justification, the tendency to defend and bolster the status quo. Existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred, and alternatives disparaged, sometimes even at the expense of individual and collective self-interest.

=== Self-assessment ===
* Dunning–Kruger effect, the tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability and the tendency for experts to underestimate their own ability.
* Hot-cold empathy gap, the tendency to underestimate the influence of visceral drives on one&#x27;s attitudes, preferences, and behaviors.
* Hard–easy effect, the tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s ability to accomplish hard tasks, and underestimate one&#x27;s ability to accomplish easy tasks.
* Illusion of explanatory depth, the tendency to believe that one understands a topic much better than one actually does. The effect is strongest for explanatory knowledge, whereas people tend to be better at self-assessments for procedural, narrative, or factual knowledge.
* Impostor Syndrome, a psychological occurrence in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud. Also known as impostor phenomenon.
* Objectivity illusion, the phenomena where people tend to believe that they are more objective and unbiased than others. This bias can apply to itself – where people are able to see when others are affected by the objectivity illusion, but unable to see it in themselves. See also &quot;bias blind spot.&quot;

=== Truth judgment ===
* Belief bias, an effect where someone&#x27;s evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is biased by the believability of the conclusion.
* Illusory truth effect, the tendency to believe that a statement is true if it is easier to process, or if it has been stated multiple times, regardless of its actual veracity. These are specific cases of truthiness.
* Rhyme as reason effect, where rhyming statements are perceived as more truthful.
* Subjective validation, where statements are perceived as true if a subject&#x27;s belief demands it to be true. Also assigns perceived connections between coincidences. (Compare confirmation bias.)

=== Other ===
=== Social ===
==== Association fallacy ====

Association fallacies include:
* Authority bias, the tendency to attribute greater accuracy to the opinion of an authority figure (unrelated to its content) and be more influenced by that opinion.
* Cheerleader effect, the tendency for people to appear more attractive in a group than in isolation.
* Halo effect, the tendency for a person&#x27;s positive or negative traits to &quot;spill over&quot; from one personality area to another in others&#x27; perceptions of them (see also physical attractiveness stereotype).

==== Attribution bias ====

Attribution bias includes:
* Actor-observer bias, the tendency for explanations of other individuals&#x27; behaviors to overemphasize the influence of their personality and underemphasize the influence of their situation (see also Fundamental attribution error), and for explanations of one&#x27;s own behaviors to do the opposite (that is, to overemphasize the influence of our situation and underemphasize the influence of our own personality).
* Defensive attribution hypothesis, a tendency to attribute more blame to a harm-doer as the outcome becomes more severe or as personal or situational similarity to the victim increases.
* Extrinsic incentives bias, an exception to the &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot;, where people view others as having (situational) extrinsic motivations and (dispositional) intrinsic motivations for oneself
* Fundamental attribution error, the tendency for people to overemphasize personality-based explanations for behaviors observed in others while under-emphasizing the role and power of situational influences on the same behavior (see also actor-observer bias, group attribution error, positivity effect, and negativity effect).
* Group attribution error, the biased belief that the characteristics of an individual group member are reflective of the group as a whole or the tendency to assume that group decision outcomes reflect the preferences of group members, even when information is available that clearly suggests otherwise.
* Hostile attribution bias, the tendency to interpret others&#x27; behaviors as having hostile intent, even when the behavior is ambiguous or benign.
* Intentionality bias, the tendency to judge human action to be intentional rather than accidental.
* Just-world hypothesis, the tendency for people to want to believe that the world is fundamentally just, causing them to rationalize an otherwise inexplicable injustice as deserved by the victim(s).
* Moral luck, the tendency for people to ascribe greater or lesser moral standing based on the outcome of an event.
* Puritanical bias, the tendency to attribute cause of an undesirable outcome or wrongdoing by an individual to a moral deficiency or lack of self-control rather than taking into account the impact of broader societal determinants .
* Self-serving bias, the tendency to claim more responsibility for successes than failures. It may also manifest itself as a tendency for people to evaluate ambiguous information in a way beneficial to their interests (see also group-serving bias).
* Ultimate attribution error, similar to the fundamental attribution error, in this error a person is likely to make an internal attribution to an entire group instead of the individuals within the group.

==== Conformity ====

Conformity is involved in the following:
* Availability cascade, a self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or &quot;repeat something long enough and it will become true&quot;). See also availability heuristic.
* Bandwagon effect, the tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior.
* , the tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one&#x27;s true opinion, so as to avoid offending anyone.
* Groupthink, the psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.
* Groupshift, the tendency for decisions to be more risk-seeking or risk-averse than the group as a whole, if the group is already biased in that direction
* Social desirability bias, the tendency to over-report socially desirable characteristics or behaviours in oneself and under-report socially undesirable characteristics or behaviours. See also: .
* Truth bias is people&#x27;s inclination towards believing, to some degree, the communication of another person, regardless of whether or not that person is actually lying or being untruthful.

==== Ingroup bias ====

Ingroup bias is the tendency for people to give preferential treatment to others they perceive to be members of their own groups. It is related to the following:
* Not invented here, an aversion to contact with or use of products, research, standards, or knowledge developed outside a group.
* Outgroup homogeneity bias, where individuals see members of other groups as being relatively less varied than members of their own group.

==== Other social biases ====
== Memory ==
In psychology and cognitive science, a memory bias is a cognitive bias that either enhances or impairs the recall of a memory (either the chances that the memory will be recalled at all, or the amount of time it takes for it to be recalled, or both), or that alters the content of a reported memory. There are many types of memory bias, including:

=== Misattribution of memory ===
The misattributions include:
* Cryptomnesia, where a memory is mistaken for novel thought or imagination, because there is no subjective experience of it being a memory.
* False memory, where imagination is mistaken for a memory.
* Social cryptomnesia, a failure by people and society in general to remember the origin of a change, in which people know that a change has occurred in society, but forget how this change occurred; that is, the steps that were taken to bring this change about, and who took these steps. This has led to reduced social credit towards the minorities who made major sacrifices that led to a change in societal values.
* Source confusion, episodic memories are confused with other information, creating distorted memories.
* Suggestibility, where ideas suggested by a questioner are mistaken for memory.
* The Perky effect, where real images can influence imagined images, or be misremembered as imagined rather than real

<text>Fellowship of the Royal Society (FRS, ForMemRS and HonFRS) is an award granted by the Fellows of the Royal Society of London to individuals who have made a &quot;substantial contribution to the improvement of natural knowledge, including mathematics, engineering science, and medical science&quot;.

== Overview ==

Fellowship of the Society, the oldest known scientific academy in continuous existence, is a significant honour. It has been awarded to many eminent scientists throughout history, including Isaac Newton (1672), Benjamin Franklin (1756), Charles Babbage (1816), Michael Faraday (1824), Charles Darwin (1839), Ernest Rutherford (1903), Srinivasa Ramanujan (1918), Jagadish Chandra Bose (1920), Albert Einstein (1921), Paul Dirac (1930), Winston Churchill (1941), Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1944), Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis (1945), Dorothy Hodgkin (1947), Alan Turing (1951), Lise Meitner (1955), Satyendra Nath Bose (1958), and Francis Crick (1959). More recently, fellowship has been awarded to Stephen Hawking (1974), David Attenborough (1983), Tim Hunt (1991), Elizabeth Blackburn (1992), Raghunath Mashelkar (1998), Tim Berners-Lee (2001), Venki Ramakrishnan (2003), Atta-ur-Rahman (2006), Andre Geim (2007), Bai Chunli (2014), James Dyson (2015), Ajay Kumar Sood (2015), Subhash Khot (2017), Elon Musk (2018), Elaine Fuchs (2019) and around 8,000 others in total, including over 280 Nobel Laureates since 1900. , there are approximately 1,689 living Fellows, Foreign and Honorary Members, of whom 85 are Nobel Laureates.

Fellowship of the Royal Society has been described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the equivalent of a lifetime achievement Oscar&quot; with several institutions celebrating their announcement each year.

== Fellowships ==

Up to 60 new Fellows (FRS), honorary (HonFRS) and foreign members (ForMemRS) are elected annually in late April or early May, from a pool of around 700 proposed candidates each year. New Fellows can only be nominated by existing Fellows for one of the fellowships described below:

=== Fellow ===
Every year, up to 52 new fellows are elected from the United Kingdom, the rest of the Commonwealth of Nations, and Ireland, which make up around 90% of the society. Each candidate is considered on their merits and can be proposed from any sector of the scientific community. Fellows are elected for life on the basis of excellence in science and are entitled to use the post-nominal letters FRS.

=== Foreign member ===
Every year, fellows elect up to ten new foreign members. Like fellows, foreign members are elected for life through peer review on the basis of excellence in science. , there are around 165 foreign members, who are entitled to use the post-nominal ForMemRS.

=== Honorary fellow ===
Honorary Fellowship is an honorary academic title awarded to candidates who have given distinguished service to the cause of science, but do not have the kind of scientific achievements required of Fellows or Foreign Members. Honorary Fellows include the World Health Organization&#x27;s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (2022), Bill Bryson (2013), Melvyn Bragg (2010), Robin Saxby (2015), David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville (2008), Onora O&#x27;Neill (2007), John Maddox (2000), Patrick Moore (2001) and Lisa Jardine (2015). Honorary Fellows are entitled to use the post nominal letters HonFRS.

=== Former statute 12 fellowships ===
Statute 12 is a legacy mechanism for electing members before official honorary membership existed in 1997. Fellows elected under statute 12 include David Attenborough (1983) and John Palmer, 4th Earl of Selborne (1991).

=== Royal Fellow ===
The Council of the Royal Society can recommend members of the British royal family for election as Royal Fellow of the Royal Society. there are four royal fellows:
# Charles III, elected 1978 
#Anne, Princess Royal, elected 1987 
#Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, elected 1990 
#William, Prince of Wales, elected 2009

Elizabeth II was not a Royal Fellow, but provided her patronage to the society, as all reigning British monarchs have done since Charles II of England. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (1951) was elected under statute 12, not as a Royal Fellow.

==Election of new fellows==
The election of new fellows is announced annually in May, after their nomination and a period of peer-reviewed selection.

=== Nomination===
Each candidate for Fellowship or Foreign Membership is nominated by two Fellows of the Royal Society (a proposer and a seconder), who sign a certificate of proposal. Previously, nominations required at least five fellows to support each nomination by the proposer, which was criticised for supposedly establishing an old boy network and elitist gentlemen&#x27;s club. The certificate of election (see for example) includes a statement of the principal grounds on which the proposal is being made. There is no limit on the number of nominations made each year. In 2015, there were 654 candidates for election as Fellows and 106 candidates for Foreign Membership.

=== Selection===
The Council of the Royal Society oversees the selection process and appoints 10 subject area committees, known as Sectional Committees, to recommend the strongest candidates for election to the Fellowship. The final list of up to 52 Fellowship candidates and up to 10 Foreign Membership candidates is confirmed by the Council in April, and a secret ballot of Fellows is held at a meeting in May. A candidate is elected if they secure two-thirds of votes of those Fellows voting.

An indicative allocation of 18 Fellowships can be allocated to candidates from Physical Sciences and Biological Sciences; and up to 10 from Applied Sciences, Human Sciences and Joint Physical and Biological Sciences. A further maximum of six can be &#x27;Honorary&#x27;, &#x27;General&#x27; or &#x27;Royal&#x27; Fellows. Nominations for Fellowship are peer reviewed by Sectional Committees, each with at least 12 members and a Chair (all of whom are Fellows of the Royal Society). Members of the 10 Sectional Committees change every three years to mitigate in-group bias. Each Sectional Committee covers different specialist areas including:

# Computer science
# Mathematics
# Astronomy and physics
# Chemistry
# Engineering
# Earth science and environmental science
# Molecules of Life
# Cell biology
# Multicellular organisms
# Patterns in Populations

===Admission===
New Fellows are admitted to the Society at a formal admissions day ceremony held annually in July, when they sign the Charter Book and the Obligation which reads:
&quot;We who have hereunto subscribed, do hereby promise, that we will endeavour to promote the good of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge, and to pursue the ends for which the same was founded; that we will carry out, as far as we are able, those actions requested of us in the name of the Council; and that we will observe the Statutes and Standing Orders of the said Society. Provided that, whensoever any of us shall signify to the President under our hands, that we desire to withdraw from the Society, we shall be free from this Obligation for the future&quot;.

Since 2014, portraits of Fellows at the admissions ceremony have been published without copyright restrictions in Wikimedia Commons under a more permissive Creative Commons license which allows wider re-use.

==Research fellowships and other awards==
In addition to the main fellowships of the Royal Society (FRS, ForMemRS &amp; HonFRS), other fellowships are available which are applied for by individuals, rather than through election. These fellowships are research grant awards and holders are known as Royal Society Research Fellows.
* University research fellowships (URFs): Royal Society University Research Fellowships are for outstanding scientists in the UK who are in the early stages of their research career and have the potential to become leaders in their field. Previous holders of URFs to have been elected FRS at a later date include Richard Borcherds (1994), Jean Beggs (1998), Frances Ashcroft (1999), Athene Donald (1999) and John Pethica (1999). More recent awardees include Terri Attwood, Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Brian Cox, Sarah Bridle, Shahn Majid, Tanya Monro, Beth Shapiro, David J. Wales and Katherine Willis. 
* Royal Society Leverhulme Trust senior research fellowships are for scientists who would benefit from a period of full-time research without teaching and administrative duties, supported by the Leverhulme Trust.
* Newton advanced fellowships provide established international researchers with an opportunity to develop the research strengths and capabilities of their research group. These are provided by the Newton Fund as part of the UK&#x27;s official development assistance.
* Industry fellowships are for academic scientists who want to work on a collaborative project with industry, and for scientists in industry who want to work on a collaborative project with an academic organisation. 
* Dorothy Hodgkin fellowships are for outstanding scientists in the UK at an early stage of their research career who require a flexible working pattern due to personal circumstances. These fellowships are named after Dorothy Hodgkin.

In addition to the award of Fellowship (FRS, HonFRS &amp; ForMemRS) and the Research Fellowships described above, several other awards, lectures and medals of the Royal Society are also given.

<doc id="510796" wikidata="Q4346548" url="?curid=510796" title="HMS Arbiter">
<text>USS &quot;St. Simon&quot; (CVE-51) (originally AVG-51 then later ACV-51), an escort aircraft carrier originally classified as an auxiliary aircraft carrier, was laid down on 26 April 1943 at Tacoma, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 262); reclassified as an escort aircraft carrier, CVE-51, on 15 July 1943; launched on 9 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. R. H. Lewis, the wife of Major General R. H. Lewis, Commanding General, Northwestern Sector, Fort Lewis, Washington; assigned to the Commercial Iron Works, Portland, Oregon, for the completion of construction; and delivered to the Royal Navy, under lend-lease, on 31 December 1943.

Renamed HMS &quot;Arbiter&quot; (D31) (while being carried on the United States&#x27; Naval Vessel Register with the classification BCVE-51), the escort carrier served in the Royal Navy for the duration of World War II. She earned &quot;battle honors&quot; in the Atlantic during 1944, serving on the western approaches to the British Isles, and in 1945 served as one of seven similar ships engaged in operating as an aircraft ferry supporting the British Pacific Fleet&#x27;s train, bringing up replacement aircraft or providing combat air patrol for replenishment ships.

Returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 February 1946, she was accepted by the United States Navy on 3 March 1946. Struck from the Navy list on 12 April 1946, the ship was sold to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News, Virginia, on 30 January 1947. Converted to the cargo ship &quot;Coracero&quot;, the former escort carrier served under two more names, &quot;President Macapagal&quot; from 1965 to 1972 and &quot;Lucky Two&quot; in 1972 before she was scrapped in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 1972.

==Design and description==
These ships were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American-built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced standard and full load. Propulsion was provided by a General Electric geared steam turbinefed with steam by two Foster Wheeler boilers, and driving one shaft. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge/flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft elevators by in size, one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. &quot;Arbiter&quot; was armed with two 5&quot;/38 caliber guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and 35 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon (14 twin and 7 single mounts). The ship could operate a maximum of 30 aircraft or carry as many as 90 in the ferry role.
==Construction and service==
The ship was laid down at the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation&#x27;s Seattle shipyard on 26 April 1943. The carrier was originally planned to be operated by the US Navy with the name USS &quot;St Simon&quot;, with the hull number AVC-51 (for Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier), which was changed to CVE-51 (for Escort Carrier) on 15 July 1943. She was launched on 9 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. R. H. Lewis, the wife of Major General R. H. Lewis, Commanding General, Northwestern Sector, Fort Lewis, Washington and was completed at the Commercial Ironworks of Portland, Oregon. The ship was handed over to the Royal Navy under the Lend Lease programme on 31 December 1943, commissioning as HMS &quot;Arbiter&quot; on the same day, with the Pennant number D31.

Following commissioning, &quot;Arbiter&quot; underwent modification for Royal Navy service at Esquimalt in Western Canada, before transferring to the East coast of the United States via the Panama Canal. In May 1944, she embarked the Grumman Avengers of 853 Naval Air Squadron and the Curtiss Helldivers of 1820 Naval Air Squadron, both recently formed in the United States, and crossed the Atlantic to Britain. In September 1944, &quot;Arbiter&quot; entered refit at Belfast, with changes including a modified fuel system incorporating the lessons on the loss of the carrier from an internal explosion in 1943.

At the end of January 1945, &quot;Arbiter&quot; was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF) as a Ferry Carrier, supporting operations by the BPF&#x27;s Fleet Carriers. She sailed for Australia on 1 March 1945, carrying the Vought Corsairs of 1843 Naval Air Squadron for the passage, arriving in Australia in May that year. She carried out her first ferry operation to the BPF in July, and later that month was fitted with hoses to act as a tanker in replenishment at sea operations using the astern method, to make up for a shortage of dedicated tankers. After the end of the war against Japan, she returned to Australia, where she was used for deck landing training for ex-RAAF pilots transferred to the nascent Australian Fleet Air Arm. From October 1945 to January 1946, &quot;Arbiter&quot; was used to repatriate Prisoners of War from Hong Kong to Australia and the Great Britain.

&quot;Arbiter&quot; was handed back to the US Navy on 3 March 1946 at Norfolk, Virginia and was struck from the US Navy on 30 April 1946. She was sold on 30 January 1947 and converted to the merchant ship &quot;Cocacero&quot;, joining the shipping company Compania Argentina de Navegacion Dodero. The ship was renamed &quot;President Macapagal&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Lucky Two&quot; in 1972, and was broken up at Kaohsiung, Taiwan from May 1972.

<text>Sailing ships frequently encounter difficult conditions, whether by storm or combat, and the crew frequently called upon to cope with accidents, ranging from the parting of a single line to the whole destruction of the rigging, and from running aground to fire.

==Steering==
The sailboat is particularly vulnerable to capsizing or hitting a shoal or rock in the water when the steering fails. In heavy chop there is a lot of force on the rudder as it is pushed by the water. If the ship is flying a Spinnaker and it loses steering, the boat will most likely broach (head up into wind), which will, on most boats, cause a capsize in heavy weather. It is possible to sail smaller dinghies without a rudder using only sail adjustment.

==Rigging==
Running rigging is often subject to parting, especially during bad weather, or when attempting to carry too much sail in a strong wind. For instance, the brace on the weather side is under a considerable strain, and its parting would allow the entire yard to swing free, a rather ugly prospect for a spar up to 30 meters long. In general, for each line there is a procedure to a) reduce the forces at play, b) use other lines to bring loose items under control, and c) run a replacement line (retying is not usually an option, since the knot will not fit through the blocks). The most critical lines will sometimes have a backup in the form of a &quot;preventer&quot; line serving the same function.

Standing rigging is a structural element that holds up the masts, and loss of standing rigging puts them at risk of being sprung (cracked) or simply snapped off. By the end of the age of sail, most stays had preventers, and warships equipped themselves with &quot;rigging stoppers&quot; or &quot;fighting stoppers&quot;, small lengths of rope arranged so they could be attached to shrouds quickly and tightened.

In the days of wooden construction, sprung masts were a serious problem, because their structural integrity was compromised, and the next gust of wind could easily bring them down. Upper masts were usually just replaced by spares carried for the purpose. The usual recourse for the lower mast was to &quot;fish&quot; it by lashing a special set of spars to the mast along the cracked area.

If the mast was gone altogether, it had to be replaced with a jury rig assembled from whatever spars were available.

==Cargo shift==
On a ship, cargo must be stowed evenly so that the ship floats upright. All ships are vulnerable to cargo shifting, causing the ship to develop a list to one side. However sailing ships are particularly vulnerable because the ship naturally heels over in reaction to the force of the wind on the sails. If the cargo is not adequately secured the cargo may fall to the leeward side of the ship. Loose cargos (e.g. grain) flow downhill like water if not adequately secured (e.g. by shifting boards) and are particularly prone to shifting. If a large quantity of cargo shifts the ship may develop such a heavy list that she capsizes. A catastrophic cargo shift caused the loss of the tall ship Pamir in 1957.

==Grounding==
Ship grounding is a type of marine accident that involves the impact of a ship on the seabed, resulting in damage of the submerged part of her hull and in particularly the bottom structure, potentially leading to water ingress and compromise of the ship&#x27;s structural integrity and stability. Grounding induces extreme loads onto marine structures and is a marine accident of profound importance due to its impact:
* The environmental impact, especially in the case where large tanker ships are involved.
* The loss of human life.
* Financial consequences to local communities close to the accident.
* The financial consequences to ship-owners, due to ship loss or penalties. The grounding, depending on the maneuvers of the master before the impact, may result in the ship being stranded. Depending on the nature of the relief of the seabed at the location, i.e. being muddy or rocky, different measures have to be taken to release the ship and carry it to a safe harbor.

==Capsizing==
A capsize is when a vessel rolls over beyond the limit angle of positive static stability.
The severity of a capsize depends on the size and design of a vessel. A small dinghy is designed to capsize and be righted by her crew. Yachts are typically built to right themselves even if heeled over beyond 90 degrees. However a large sailing ship will typically lose all stability at a smaller angle of heel, and will be vulnerable to downflooding and sinking if heeled beyond this point.

Ballasted monohull sailing yachts will capsize very easily if they lose their external ballast keel. Fortunately, this is rare, but if it does, it is a life-threatening danger, as seen in the case of the sunken &quot;Cheeki Rafiki&quot;.

==Fire==
Fire is a serious threat to all ships, but to a ship made of wood, rope, and canvas, it was the greatest danger of all. Cooking fires in the galley were watched constantly, and put out instantly if the weather turned ugly, or an enemy ship appeared in the distance. Warships had an elaborate set of procedures for handling their gunpowder; the magazines were deep in the ship and the lanterns kept in another room, with a window between.

The introduction of steam power in the mid-19th century was attended by the use of &quot;fire-engines&quot; consisting of pumps and hoses. Even so, fire was fatal to a ship far more often than not.

<doc id="510803" wikidata="Q1801110" url="?curid=510803" title="Lake Winnebago">
<text>Lake Winnebago (, , ) is a shallow freshwater lake in the north central United States, located in east central Wisconsin. At 137,700 acres, it is the largest lake entirely within the state, covering an area of about 30 miles by 10 miles with 88 miles of shoreline, an average depth of 15.5 feet, and a maximum depth of 21 feet. It has many shallow reefs along the west shore and a drop-off type shoreline on the east. There are several islands along the west shore.

The lake has two primary tributaries, the Wolf and Fox Rivers, which combine at Lake Butte des Morts. The Fox River flows east through Oshkosh and into Lake Winnebago at its west central shore, then flows out at the northwest shore, around Doty Island at Neenah-Menasha to Little Lake Butte des Morts. The river then flows northeast and empties into Green Bay and serves as part of the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway. Lake Winnebago is part of a larger system of lakes in Wisconsin known as the Winnebago Pool.

Cities on its shores include the aforementioned Oshkosh, Neenah, and Menasha, as well as Fond du Lac at the south shore. Municipal drinking water systems serving over 200,000 people draw directly from the lake, including systems serving the cities of Oshkosh, Neenah, Menasha, and Appleton.

==History==
The lake is a remnant of Glacial Lake Oshkosh approximately 12,000 years ago. Ice blocked water from entering Lake Michigan at Green Bay, and the glacial lake ponded against ice since it had no outlet.

The Niagara Escarpment is a few miles east of Lake Winnebago. The softer Ordovician rocks that underlie the lake have eroded away, and the stronger Silurian rocks stand as a ridge that formed the lake basin.

In 1634, the French encountered the Ho-Chunk on the shores of Green Bay, inhabiting the area stretching to Lake Winnebago. Although &quot;Ho-Chunk&quot; is the people&#x27;s own name for themselves, their Algonquian neighbors called them &quot;Winnebago&quot;, which means &quot;[people of the] stinking water.&quot; This term was used by the Algonquians because Lake Winnebago had a strong fish odor in the summer.

The steamer B. F. Carter made a trip from the east shore to the west shore at Oshkosh every two weeks in the 1880s during the summer season.

Lake Winnebago is known for having occasional ice shoves on very windy days in March as the winter ice breaks up. Residents have described that it &quot;sounds like a freight train.&quot; Buildings directly on the shoreline have been wrecked by the shoves, which are up to 25 feet high.

==Locks and dams==
Lake Winnebago is not man-made, but its level was raised about three feet (0.9 m) by two dams on either side of Doty Island, erected in 1850 and 1930. The lake level is today regulated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to meet demands for flood control, to reduce ice damage to private property, to release water for hydropower and pollution dilution downstream, and to extend the high water season for boating.

A system of seventeen locks connects Lake Winnebago to Lake Michigan at Green Bay, an elevation drop of about . This lock system is located along the lower Fox River and starts at the northwest corner of Lake Winnebago in the city of Menasha and ends at the mouth of Green Bay. One of the locks, the Rapid Croche Lock, is permanently sealed as a barrier to prevent the movement of sea lamprey upstream, and only three of the remaining locks were being maintained. Lock reconstruction is underway and is being supervised by the Fox River Navigation Authority.

==Recreation==
Many annual events take place on the Winnebago Pool, including shoreline concerts, fishing tournaments, power boat events, pleasure boating rallies, windsurfing, sail runs and ice racing.

===Boating===
Along with the upper lakes of Big Lake Butte des Morts, Winneconne, Poygan, the Wolf River and the upper and lower Fox River, it is a popular pleasure boating area. A 1989 survey of boating intensity by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ranked the Winnebago Pool as the state&#x27;s busiest inland waterway, surpassing the Mississippi River.

===Parks===

High Cliff State Park on the lake&#x27;s northeast shore offers camping, hiking trails, views of the lake, a marina, beach, an observation tower, and picnic areas. Camping is available at Calumet County Park and Columbia County Park in Fond du Lac County. Effigy mounds overlook the lake at High Cliff and Calumet County Park.

Lakeside Park in Fond du Lac is a municipal park on the southern shore of Lake Winnebago with picnic areas, shelters/gazebos, a playground, a deer park, baseball diamonds, a marina, and boat launch ramps. Train rides, an old fashioned carousel, bumper boats, aqua bikes, and canoes are available for rides. A petting zoo is open Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. The Fond du Lac River enters Lake Winnebago on the eastern border of the park.

Menominee Park in Oshkosh features trails, fishing piers, boat launches, a zoo, a small amusement park, and softball, tennis and basketball facilities. It is the former site of the city&#x27;s Sawdust Days Festival in July.

===Fishing===
Lake Winnebago is one of the more heavily fished lakes in the state. Many fishermen consider it one of the nation&#x27;s top walleye fisheries. Other species present include bluegill, largemouth bass, muskellunge, northern pike, perch, burbot, white bass, crappie, freshwater drum, channel catfish, flathead catfish, and smallmouth bass. In June 2010, Oshkosh hosted an event recognized by Guinness World Records as history&#x27;s largest fishing tournament. A 2007 study put the economic value of recreational fishing at approximately $300 million per year.
====Winter====
Ice fishing is popular on Lake Winnebago, and it is not uncommon for 10,000 cars to park on it during the ice fishing season. Expansion cracks on the ice are bridged, and many cities along the east and west shores plow roads on the icy surface. Sauger and walleye predominate, with rare perch and white bass catches.

The spearfishing season for lake sturgeon is in February. The first year of regulated sturgeon spearing was 1903, when an eight-pound limit was introduced. All sturgeon spearing was banned from 1915 to 1931. The lake had the largest population of sturgeon in the United States in 2003. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources regulates the number of fish taken each year.

====Other seasons====
Late spring (between May 5 and June 30) is dominated by walleye and sauger fishing. Sauger, also known as sand pike, bite the best in cooler water. June fishing is the peak time for white bass, and July for perch. Fishing declines in fall.

== In popular culture ==
The setting for Dr. Seuss&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s book &quot;Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose&quot; is &quot;Lake Winna-Bango&quot; on the &quot;far northern shore.&quot;

The lake is one of thirteen shown in James Benning&#x27;s film &quot;13 Lakes&quot;.

<doc id="510806" wikidata="Q888215" url="?curid=510806" title="Dinuzulu KaCetshwayo">
<text>Dinuzulu kaCetshwayo ( – 18 October 1913, commonly misspelled Dinizulu) was the king of the Zulu nation from 20 May 1884 until his death in 1913. He succeeded his father Cetshwayo, who was the last king of the Zulus to be officially recognised as such by the British. Zululand had been broken up into thirteen smaller territories by the British government after the Anglo-Zulu War, and Cetshwayo, and subsequently Dinuzulu, administered one of them. The British later realised the futility of breaking up Zululand into the territories and restored Cetshwayo as paramount leader of the territories. However, they left one of Cetshwayo&#x27;s relatives, Usibepu (Zibhebhu), alone with his lands intact. On 22 July 1883, Usibepu attacked Cetshwayo&#x27;s new kraal in Ulundi, wounding the king and causing him to flee.

==Dinuzulu&#x27;s volunteers==
To contest the succession, Dinuzulu first appealed to the British, but received no response. He then offered rewards of land to Boer farmers of the Vryheid and Utrecht districts, to come and fight on his side and restore the Zulu Kingdom. In 1884 a group of Boer farmers from the districts of Utrecht and Vryheid undertook to help restore order, in return for land for the formation of an independent republic with access to the sea. Led by General Louis Botha, they formed Dinuzulu&#x27;s Volunteers and after several clashes with Zibhebhu, defeated him at the Battle of Ghost Mountain (also known as the Battle of Tshaneni) on 5 June 1884.
The Nieuwe Republiek, established in northern Natal on land awarded to Boers by Dinuzulu, was recognized by Germany and Portugal. It was later incorporated on its request by the ZAR because of financial problems, after the British annexed the coastal plains from the Thukela river (Tugela) northwards in order to prevent the Boers from building a harbor. After considerable dispute in a Natal arbitration court, Britain eventually recognized the New Republic, but reduced it in size after annexing the coastal plains to the Cape Colony, along with the republic&#x27;s claims to St Lucia for a harbor. The Niewe Republiek was incorporated on its own request with the Zuid Afrikaanse Republiek in 1888. No major conflict would occur in the region until the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899.

==Exile==
In 1890 Dinuzulu was captured by the British and exiled to the island of Saint Helena for seven years, for leading a Zulu army against the British due to annexation of the coastal plains of Zululand.

When Zululand was formally incorporated into Natal in 1897, Dinuzulu was released. The following year he was installed as the British government&#x27;s InDuna.

==Bambatha rebellion==
In 1906 the so-called Bambatha rebellion broke out. After the rebellion had been put down, Dinuzulu was accused of giving orders to Bambatha to start the rebellion and was put on trial for treason. Although he steadfastly protested his innocence, he was found guilty and sentenced to four years imprisonment in March, 1908.

Two years later an old friend of his, General Louis Botha, became Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Botha ordered that Dinuzulu be released and transported to the farm &quot;Uitkyk&quot; in the Transvaal, where he died on 18 October 1913 at the age of 44 or 45. After a state funeral, he was buried at Nobamba in the Khosini Valley (31°16&#x27;E; 28°26&#x27;S), which lies in the upper White Umfolozi drainage system.
He was succeeded by his son Solomon kaDinuzulu.

==Statue==
A statue of Dinuzulu has been erected next to the statue of General Louis Botha, the first prime minister of the Transvaal colony, at the corner of Berea Road and Warwick Avenue in Durban.

==Wood Badge beads==
Beads from Dinuzulu&#x27;s necklace—claimed to have been found by Robert Baden-Powell—were later presented to Scout leaders following Wood Badge leadership training. Today the Wood Badge beads are replicas of the original beads. To date, there is conflicting evidence as to how Baden-Powell came upon the beads as well as the specific purpose and owner of the beads. Alternative stories include that Baden-Powell took the beads improperly, and that the beads were not war beads but actually belonged to a woman, such as a wife of Dinuzulu.

<text>Sydney Hillel Schanberg (January 17, 1934 July 9, 2016) was an American journalist who was best known for his coverage of the war in Cambodia. He was the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, two George Polk awards, two Overseas Press Club awards, and the Sigma Delta Chi prize for distinguished journalism. Schanberg was portrayed by Sam Waterston in the 1984 film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; based on the experiences of Schanberg and the Cambodian journalist Dith Pran in Cambodia.

==Early life and career==
Sydney Schanberg was born to a Jewish family in Clinton, Massachusetts, the son of Freda (Feinberg) and Louis Schanberg, a grocery store owner. He studied at Clinton High School in 1951 before receiving a B.A. in Government from Harvard University in 1955. After initially enrolling at Harvard Law School, he requested to be moved up the draft list and undertook basic military training at Fort Hood in Texas.

Schanberg joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a journalist in 1959. He spent much of the early 1970s in Southeast Asia as a correspondent for the &quot;Times&quot;. For his reporting, he won the George Polk Award for excellence in journalism twice, in 1971 and 1974. In 1971, he wrote about the Pakistani genocide in then-East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) as New Delhi bureau chief (1969–1973). Upon becoming Southeast Asia correspondent (1973–1975), he covered the Vietnam War.

Following years of combat, Schanberg wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about the departure of the Americans and the coming regime change, writing about the Cambodians that &quot;it is difficult to imagine how their lives could be anything but better with the Americans gone.&quot; A dispatch he wrote on April 13, 1975, written from Phnom Penh, ran with the headline &quot;Indochina without Americans: for most, a better life.&quot;

Writing about his experiences following the Khmer Rouge takeover, Schanberg acknowledged that &quot;I watched many Cambodian friends being herded out of Phnom Penh. Most of them I never saw again. All of us felt like betrayers, like people who were protected and didn&#x27;t do enough to save our friends. We felt shame. We still do.&quot;, and utterly condemned the &quot;maniacal Khmer Rouge guerrillas&quot;. He was one of the few American journalists to remain behind in Phnom Penh after the city fell. He and his assistant were threatened with death, and took sanctuary in the French embassy. Two weeks later, he left by truck for Thailand.

==Later life==
Schanberg won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting for his Cambodia coverage. The citation reads, &quot;For his coverage of the Communist takeover in Cambodia, carried out at great risk when he elected to stay at his post after the fall of Phnom Penh.&quot; His 1980 book &quot;The Death and Life of Dith Pran&quot; was about the struggle for survival of his colleague Dith Pran in the Khmer Rouge regime. The book inspired the 1984 film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; in which Schanberg was played by Sam Waterston.

Schanberg served as the &quot;Times&quot; metropolitan editor (1977–1980) before joining the editorial pages as a columnist specializing in the New York metropolitan area in 1981. Although he was initially considered to be a leading candidate to succeed executive editor A.M. Rosenthal after receiving his Pulitzer Prize, their relationship was soon strained by Schanberg&#x27;s innovative approach to local coverage (including a proposed 1977 series on upper middle class gay professionals that was ultimately suppressed by Rosenthal) and increasingly vitriolic critiques of New York&#x27;s real estate industry. In September 1985, Schanberg&#x27;s column was cancelled by Rosenthal after he criticized the paper&#x27;s coverage of the Westway highway development. He refused a proposed writer-at-large post at &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and resigned from the &quot;Times&quot;.

Between 1986 and 1995, he was an associate editor and columnist for &quot;Newsday&quot;. He covered the United States Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs hearings and became engrossed in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue; writing for &quot;Penthouse&quot;, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, Schanberg became a leading advocate of the &quot;live prisoners left behind&quot; conspiracy theory in that matter. He published many articles on the subject and outlined reasons why no POWs were ever found, alleging that government officials never seriously investigated reports of live POWs due to fear of public outrage, and to save embarrassment and prevent damage to their reputations and careers. He further said in his articles that the Vietnamese never admitted to holding prisoners in order to be accepted by the international community, and that they&#x27;d initially tried to ransom them for reparations once the war ended.

In 1992, Schanberg received the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award as well as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Colby College. After leaving &quot;Newsday&quot;, he worked as head of investigations for APBNews.com, shepherding the fledgling digital publication to a 1999 Investigative Reporters and Editors award. He settled in exurban New Paltz, New York after serving as the inaugural James H. Ottaway Sr. Visiting Professor of Journalism at the State University of New York at New Paltz in 2001.

In 2006, Schanberg resigned from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (where he had served as a staff writer and &quot;Press Clips&quot; columnist since 2002) in protest over the editorial, political and personnel changes made by the new publisher, New Times Media.

In the July 1, 2010, issue of &quot;American Conservative&quot;, Schanberg wrote an article about his struggle to advance his position that the United States government left behind hundreds of POWs being held by North Vietnam at the end of the Vietnam War. He died on July 9, 2016, after suffering a heart attack in the previous week.

<doc id="510809" wikidata="Q5004413" url="?curid=510809" title="Byron Looper">
<text>Byron (Low Tax) Looper (born Byron Anthony Looper; September 15, 1964 – June 26, 2013) was a Democratic turned Republican politician in Tennessee and convicted murderer. To advance his political career, he legally changed his middle name from &quot;Anthony&quot; to &quot;(Low Tax)&quot;, including the parentheses. After being convicted for the October 1998 murder of his election opponent, incumbent Tennessee State Senator Tommy Burks, he was given a life sentence in prison. He died in prison in 2013.

== Early life, education and early career ==

Byron Looper was born in Cookeville, Tennessee. He spent most of his childhood in Georgia, where his father, Aaron Looper, was a school superintendent.

Looper attended the U.S. Military Academy at West Point from 1983 to 1985, but he was given an honorable discharge following what he said was a serious knee injury. After being discharged, he moved to Georgia, where he attended the University of Georgia and worked for the state legislature after graduation.

In 1988, Looper ran for the Georgia House of Representatives as a Democrat, losing to Wyc Orr in the Democratic primary. He enrolled as a graduate student in the Stetson School of Business and Economics at Mercer University in Atlanta. He continued his political involvement as an officer in the Georgia Young Democrats organization and as a campaign worker in Al Gore&#x27;s 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination and the 1992 Clinton–Gore presidential campaign.

== Career ==
In 1992, Looper returned to Tennessee and became a Republican. He lost a race for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1994, when he ran against incumbent legislator Jere Hargrove.

In 1996, he legally changed his middle name from Anthony to &quot;(Low Tax)&quot; and ran successfully for the post of Putnam County tax assessor, defeating a 14-year incumbent after a campaign in which he did not make any public appearances nor participate in debates, instead relying heavily on negative campaign ads.

As tax assessor, Looper used his office&#x27;s equipment to send numerous press releases to Tennessee news media, making positive claims about himself and alleging various shortcomings on the part of other local officials. He seldom went to work, and many instances of irregularities in property tax assessments were reported. 

In March 1998, following an investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, Looper was indicted on 14 counts of official misconduct, theft of services and official oppression for theft, misuse of county property, and misuse of county employees. He claimed the charges were politically motivated due to Democratic control of Putnam County politics and the Tennessee General Assembly. The &quot;Cookeville Herald-Citizen&quot; newspaper regularly reported the Republican tax assessor&#x27;s bizarre antics and public verbal assaults of Putnam County elected officials. The Tennessee Republican Party soon claimed no connection with Looper.

The ouster suit led to Looper&#x27;s removal from office in January 1999.

Looper also faced legal problems from a former girlfriend, who sued him for $1.2 million, saying that she became pregnant and bore a child after he raped her and that he had used his official position to steal her house. Earlier, he had run campaign ads in which he falsely represented the same girlfriend as his wife.

After Looper&#x27;s removal from office and conviction for murder, prosecutors decided not to pursue the criminal indictments filed in March 1998.

== 1998 political candidacies ==

In the August 1998 primary, Looper sought the Republican nominations for both Tennessee&#x27;s 6th congressional district and Tennessee&#x27;s 15th Senate district. He failed to obtain the congressional nomination, finishing third in a field of four candidates, but he was unopposed for the state senate nomination. This set up his campaign against incumbent Democratic State Senator Tommy Burks.

Burks had represented Putnam County in the state legislature for 28 years, including four two-year terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives and five four-year terms in the Tennessee State Senate. A farmer and an old-style conservative Southern Democrat, he was popular in his district. He usually won re-election with ease, and the 1998 campaign was expected to be no different.

== Assassination of Tommy Burks ==

On the morning of October 19, 1998, authorities were called to investigate an apparent murder at the Burks farm. Tommy Burks&#x27; body was found with his head resting on the steering wheel of his pickup truck and a single bullet wound above his left eye. Burks had been speaking moments earlier with a farmhand, Wesley Rex, about work that needed to be done on the farm.

Both men had seen a black car drive by the farm on multiple occasions that morning, driven by a man in sunglasses and black gloves. The car had later sped by Rex&#x27;s truck, allowing Rex to get a view of the driver.

Cumberland County authorities could not initially find anyone with a plausible motive for murdering Burks, but after seeing a picture of Looper on television, Rex told Burks&#x27;s widow, Charlotte Burks, that Looper was the man he had seen speeding away in the black car on the morning of the murder.

Looper later turned up in Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he met with a friend, United States Marine Corps recruiter Joe Bond. Bond and Looper had been friends as children, and Looper had rekindled the friendship in the summer of 1998, largely on the basis of wanting Bond&#x27;s expertise in small arms. Bond would eventually become a key witness for the prosecution in Looper&#x27;s murder trial. Looper had stayed with Bond for a while, talking a great deal about how he had murdered his senate opponent and how he needed, among other things, to change the tires on the car he had used in the murder, as well as hide the car. 

Looper was arraigned at a hearing that featured Bond as a surprise witness for the state. During the pretrial phase, Looper attempted to have his former friend disgraced, and shuffled through at least six lawyers, one of whom filed a sealed court document explaining why, for ethical reasons, he could no longer be Looper&#x27;s attorney. 

== Campaign after the murder ==

Tennessee state law required that the name of a candidate who died before the election be removed from the ballot, and it did not allow the candidate&#x27;s party to replace a deceased candidate who died within 30 days of the election. Accordingly, after Burks&#x27;s death, Looper became the only candidate listed on the official ballot for Burks&#x27;s senate seat.

Several people tried to have Looper&#x27;s name stricken from the ballot, claiming that Looper&#x27;s arrest constituted moral turpitude. The state Republican Party distanced itself from Looper. To prevent Looper from winning the state senate seat on a technicality, Burks&#x27;s widow was put forth as a write-in candidate for her husband&#x27;s seat. Dozens of volunteers helped her campaign, including some Republicans. On election day, Charlotte Burks, as a write-in candidate, won the seat with 30,252 votes (95.18%) against Looper&#x27;s 1,531 votes (4.82%). One of her first initiatives as state senator was to introduce legislation to ensure that the name of any candidate who dies within 40 days of an election could remain on the ballot, thus preventing the situation that occurred after her husband&#x27;s death. Charlotte Burks won re-election in 2002, 2006, and 2010. She retired after the 2014 election.

== Murder conviction and sentence ==

Looper&#x27;s jury trial for murder finally occurred in 2000 after several delays because he repeatedly changed attorneys, most of whom filed a variety of motions requesting a different judge, as well as change of venue. Ultimately, Looper&#x27;s trial was not moved; jurors were brought in from Sullivan County to reduce the chance that they had been influenced by pretrial publicity. By the time of the trial, a work crew had found the weapon apparently used in the murder, near the junction of Tennessee State Route 111 and I-40.

Wes Rex and Joe Bond were both prominent witnesses for the prosecution, as were two political consultants, who reported having been contacted at various times by Looper, who had told both men that he wanted to run a political race, and felt the surest way to win would be to murder his opponent. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation expert Sandy Evans testified that the tire tracks at the scene came from Looper&#x27;s Audi. The prosecuting attorney, Tony Craighead, told the jury that Looper had intended to &quot;win this election with a Smith &amp; Wesson.&quot; For his defense, Looper tried to rely on testimony from his mother and her neighbors, who said he was visiting his mother&#x27;s home in Flowery Branch, Georgia, on the morning that Burks died, but witnesses he produced to support his alibi were excluded from testifying because they had not been identified to the court before the trial, as required by Tennessee law. Despite forensic and eyewitness evidence presented at trial, Looper&#x27;s mother maintained her son&#x27;s innocence to his death, and beyond.

In August 2000, Looper was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole. The victim&#x27;s family had requested that prosecutors not seek the death penalty. Following his conviction and sentencing, he was transferred to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Petros, Tennessee. When the Brushy Mountain Penitentiary closed in 2009, Looper was moved to the Morgan County Correctional Complex.

In late 2001, Looper sued a TV station and individual station personnel for depicting him unfavorably in a broadcast interview. Meanwhile, Looper was also the subject of &quot;Eliminating the Competition&quot;, episode 163 of the TV series &quot;American Justice&quot;.

He also filed a lawsuit against Tennessee Department of Correction personnel and the contractor that provided medical services in Tennessee prisons, charging that the conditions of his confinement were unconstitutional and that he was not receiving adequate medical care. In that suit, he asked for $47 million in damages. He also filed several unsuccessful motions to overturn his conviction.

== Death ==

Looper was found dead in his prison cell on June 26, 2013. A prison incident report shows that he assaulted a pregnant female counselor less than two hours before his body was found; Looper had to be restrained during that incident. An autopsy revealed that he had a heart condition caused by a combination of high blood pressure and hardening arteries; he also had a toxic level of antidepressants in his system.

== &quot;Low Tax&quot; name imitators ==

Other political candidates and public personalities have emulated Looper&#x27;s adopted name or have independently adopted similar names. Among these were Something Awful founder Richard &quot;Lowtax&quot; Kyanka, who adopted his nickname as a humorous reference to Byron Looper, for whom Kyanka nearly worked as an intern in the summer of 1997. In 1998, a candidate with the name Craig &#x27;Tax Freeze&#x27; Freis ran for the California Board of Equalization. He finished in fourth place (out of six candidates running) in the Democratic primary for the office. 

In Los Angeles County, a candidate named John &quot;Lower Taxes&quot; Loew ran in every election for county assessor from 2000 through 2018. He explained that he changed his name to send a message about his political positions. In 2000, Loew received less than 1% of the vote in the special election to fill a vacancy in the office. In 2002 and 2006, Loew lost the elections to incumbent Rick Auerbach by margins of 70%–11% and 77%–23% respectively. Loew ran again in 2010, where he finished in third place with 10.6% of the vote. In 2014, he finished in fourth place with 9.47% of the vote. In 2018 Loew again ran with the name &quot;Lower Taxes&quot; on the ballot and ended up in second place with 23.58%, forcing incumbent Jeffrey Prang into a runoff. Loew lost the runoff to Prang by a margin of a little over 20%.

<text>USS &quot;Vermillion&quot; (CVE-52) (previously AVG-52 then later ACV-52) was laid down on 10 May 1943 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation as a auxiliary aircraft carrier; redesignated an escort aircraft carrier, on 10 June 1943; assigned to the United Kingdom under Lend-Lease on 23 June 1943; launched on 27 September 1943; and accepted by Britain on 20 January 1944.

==Service history==
Commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Smiter&quot; (D55) (pronounced &quot;smite·er&quot;), designated a , she served the British throughout the remainder of World War II. She returned to the United States at Norfolk Naval Base, Virginia on 20 March 1946 and was officially transferred back to the United States Navy on 6 April 1946. She was immediately determined to be surplus to the needs of the Navy and was designated for sale. Her name was struck from the Navy Registry on 6 May 1946.

On 28 January 1947, she was sold to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Norfolk, Virginia, for conversion to mercantile service. She was subsequently resold to Compania Argentina de Navigacion Dodero, S.A., and entered mercantile service in 1948 at Buenos Aires as SS &quot;Artillero&quot; (renamed &quot;President Garcia&quot; in 1965). She was wrecked off Guernsey in July 1967, deemed a total loss and was scrapped at Hamburg in November of the same year.

==Design and description==

These ships were all larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft, two boilers and a steam turbine giving 9,350 shaft horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannon in single mounts. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Vought F4U Corsair or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>USS &quot;Willapa&quot; (AVG-53/ACV-53/CVE-53) was a escort carrier (originally an auxiliary aircraft carrier) built during World War II for the United States Navy. Never seeing American service, the ship was transferred to the United Kingdom as part of Lend-Lease. The escort carrier was renamed HMS &quot;Puncher&quot; (D79) of the British and crewed by the Royal Canadian Navy with aircrew from the Fleet Air Arm. Primarily used as an aircraft transport, &quot;Puncher&quot; took part in operations along the Norwegian coast towards the end of the war. Following the war the ship was converted for mercantile service and renamed Muncaster Castle, Bardic and Ben Nevis, before being broken up in 1973.

==Design and description==

The &quot;Bogue&quot; class were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American-built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. The &quot;Ruler&quot; type vessels were essentially a repeat version of the . Based on the Type C3 design, the &quot;Ruler&quot; class were acquired by the Royal Navy as part of Lend-Lease after delays in the construction of the , which the Royal Navy had intended to acquire. All the vessels in the class had a complement of 646 officers and ratings and an overall length of , a beam of at the waterline and total with a mean draught of . The escort carriers had a standard displacement of and a deep load displacement of . Propulsion was provided by one shaft turned by an Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbine powered by two Foster Wheeler boilers, rated at , which could propel the ship at maximum . The escort carrier could carry of fuel oil and had a maximum range of at or at maximum speed.

Aircraft operations were commanded from a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side of the ship. The flight deck was long and wide. The H4C hydraulic aircraft catapult was capable of launching aircraft at . To receive aircraft the ship was equipped with nine arrestor wires capable of taking aircraft at , backed up by three aircraft barriers. Two aircraft elevators accessed the hangar, with the forward elevator being long by wide and the aft elevator being 34 feet wide and 42 feet long with both capable of taking aircraft. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. However, the sloping contour of the hangar combined with the elevator arrangement made handling and storage of aircraft difficult and time-consuming. The escort carriers could store of avgas. They had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of fighter and anti-submarine (ASW) aircraft, though up to 90 could be ferried.

Armament comprised two Mark 9 /51 calibre guns, eight twin-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns, fourteen twin-mounted 20 mm Oerlikon cannon and seven single-mounted 20 mm Oerlikon cannon. Since the escort carriers came as part of Lend-Lease, they retained their American radar systems, with the SG surface radar and the SK air search radar.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Willapa&quot; was laid down on 21 May 1943 at Seattle, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation and reclassified CVE-53 on 10 June 1943. &quot;Willapa&quot; was launched on 8 November 1943. The ship was completed and transferred under lend-lease to the Royal Navy on 5 February 1944 and commissioned as HMS &quot;Puncher&quot; with the pennant number D79. On 15 March 1944, &quot;Puncher&quot; arrived at Vancouver to undergo conversion to Royal Navy standards. The British Admiralty had determined that, post-World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy would have its own aircraft carriers. For this reason, &quot;Puncher&quot; and were crewed by Royal Canadian Navy personnel to establish the knowledge base for the future carriers. However, as the Royal Canadian Navy lacked trained air personnel, the aircrew was from the Fleet Air Arm. &quot;Puncher&quot; remained under British control due to stipulations in the Lend-Lease act that prevented the Royal Navy from transferring Lend-Lease equipment to a third party.

&quot;Puncher&quot; spent the war in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. In June 1944, the escort carrier transported motor launches from New Orleans to New York. The following month, the ship transported United States Army Air Force aircraft from Norfolk, Virginia, to Casablanca in North Africa, then returned to Norfolk. From there, &quot;Puncher&quot; made two more ferry trips, taking the Vought Corsairs meant for 1845 Naval Air Squadron to the United Kingdom. Following the ferry trips, &quot;Puncher&quot; put in for repairs to builder&#x27;s defects. On 21 November 1944, &quot;Puncher&quot; embarked 821 Naval Air Squadron for trials in the Clyde area. However, on 22 November, the ship suffered a main gear failure and was forced to return to port for repairs. The gearbox proved too damaged for repair, and her sister ship, &quot;Nabob&quot;, had been laid up at Firth of Forth due to being torpedoed off Norway in August 1944, so a gearbox was removed from &quot;Nabob&quot; and installed aboard &quot;Puncher&quot;.

On 1 February 1945, &quot;Puncher&quot; joined the British Home Fleet at Scapa Flow, embarking 881 Naval Air Squadron in Grumman Wildcats and 821 Naval Air Squadron in Fairey Barracudas. Initially serving in a training role, within the year, &quot;Puncher&quot; was re-tasked to both airstrike and convoy air protection (CAP), as the damaged &quot;Nabob&quot; had been decommissioned. &quot;Puncher&quot;″s CAP service included protection of six different Arctic convoys on the Murmansk/Arkhangelsk route. Operations also included strikes against German occupied Norway, hitting industrial and shipping targets such as the steel works at Narvik. On 11 February, &quot;Puncher&quot;″s Wildcats formed part of the fighter escort for a minelaying airstrike along the western coast of Norway. The escort carrier&#x27;s aircraft then provided fighter cover for a British minesweeping mission clearing German-laid mines along the Norwegian coast. On 24 March, &quot;Puncher&quot;″s aircraft took part in an airstrike in the area of Trondheim. A second strike was planned for 3 April but was cancelled due to bad weather. Beginning on 25 June 1945, following the surrender of Germany, &quot;Puncher&quot; was utilized as a troop transport, carrying Canadian soldiers back to Canada. Her hangar had bunks welded into them and was used in this role until the end of 1945.

Paid off on 16 February 1946 at Norfolk, Virginia and returned to American custody that day, the escort carrier was struck from the Navy Registry on 12 March 1946, having never seen active service with the United States Navy. The vessel was initially sold to William B. St. John, of New York City, on 9 January 1947. The ship was subsequently resold to the British firm J. Chambers &amp; Co on 4 February 1947 and converted for mercantile service. The ship reappeared as &quot;Muncaster Castle&quot; in 1949 and was renamed &quot;Bardic&quot; in 1954. The vessel was sold to Ben Line Steamers in 1959 and renamed &quot;Ben Nevis&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;Bennevis&quot;). The vessel sailed under that name until she was sold for scrap and broken up at Kaoshiung, Taiwan on 11 June 1973 by Swie Horng Steel Enterprise Co.

<doc id="510826" wikidata="Q4219397" url="?curid=510826" title="Claudia J. Kennedy">
<text>Claudia Jean Kennedy (born July 14, 1947) is an active lieutenant general in the United States Army. She is the first woman to reach the rank of three-star general in the United States Army. She retired in 2000 after 31 years of military service.

==Early life==
Claudia Kennedy was born on July 14, 1947, in Frankfurt, during the American occupation of southern Germany after World War II. She attended Southwestern at Memphis (now Rhodes College), where she became a member of Kappa Delta sorority and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy in 1969. She was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army in June 1969.

==Military career==
After receiving her commission in 1969, Kennedy served two tours in Germany and one tour in South Korea and focused much of her military career in the fields of intelligence and cryptology.

On May 21, 1997, Kennedy became the first woman in the United States Army to hold a three-star rank. (United States Air Force Lieutenant General Leslie F. Kenne, United States Navy Vice Admiral Patricia Tracey, United States Coast Guard Vice Admiral Vivien Crea, and United States Marine Corps Lieutenant General Carol Mutter held equal ranks in other branches of the military.) She was named Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence.

Kennedy is a member of the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame.

===Accusation against another general===
In 1999, Kennedy made a sexual harassment claim against fellow officer, Major General Larry Smith, stemming from an incident in 1996 when she was a major general and he was a brigadier general. Kennedy made the accusation after Smith was slated for promotion to the position of army Deputy Inspector General, the position responsible for investigation of sexual harassment claims. Kennedy claimed that Smith had attempted to grope and kiss her; Smith&#x27;s appointment to the inspector general&#x27;s office was later withdrawn. In 2000, an inquiry by the United States Army&#x27;s Inspector General concluded that Kennedy was a victim of inappropriate sexual advances from Smith.

==Awards and decorations==
Kennedy&#x27;s awards include the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, Army Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit (three Oak Leaf Clusters), the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal (three Oak Leaf Clusters), the Army Commendation Medal (three Oak Leaf Clusters), and the Army Staff Identification Badge.

==After retirement==

Kennedy retired from the military in June 2000 after 31 years. During the 2000 United States presidential election, Kennedy was critical of George W. Bush&#x27;s proposed military policies, especially as they related to the status of women in the armed forces. According to Kennedy: &quot;If Mr. Bush becomes president, his campaign platform says he will move us back to a much earlier time.&quot; In other matters of military policy, Kennedy supported repealing the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy.

In 2002, Democrats actively sought to recruit Kennedy to challenge Senator John Warner, a Republican from Virginia. Kennedy passed on the race.

She contributed the piece &quot;Redefining the Warrior Mentality: Women in the Military&quot; to the 2003 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women&#x27;s Anthology for a New Millennium&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

Kennedy endorsed Senator John Kerry for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination in September 2003, and served as an advisor to the Kerry campaign. She sometimes was mentioned as a possible nominee for Secretary of Defense in a Kerry administration. She endorsed military veteran candidates Eric Massa and Patrick Murphy in 2006. In 2007 and 2008 she endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama in their respective campaigns for the presidency. She was discussed as a potential vice presidential choice for the Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama.

In June 2010, she was appointed as chairwoman of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a committee which is appointed by the United States Secretary of Defense and which reports to the United States Department of Defense.

Kennedy also served as co-chair of the Platform Committee of the 2012 Democratic National Convention.

<doc id="510828" wikidata="Q7448101" url="?curid=510828" title="Self-governing colony">
<text>In the British Empire, a self-governing colony was a colony with an elected government in which elected rulers were able to make most decisions without referring to the colonial power with nominal control of the colony. This was in contrast to a Crown colony, in which the British Government ruled and legislated via an appointed Governor, with or without the assistance of an appointed Council. Most self-governing colonies had responsible government.

Self-governing colonies for the most part had no formal authority over constitutional matters such as the monarchy and the constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London serves as the ultimate avenue of appeal in matters of law and justice.

Colonies have sometimes been referred to as &quot;self-governing&quot; in situations where the executive has been under the control of neither the imperial government nor a local legislature elected by universal suffrage but by a local oligarchy state. In most cases such control had been exercised by a ruling class from a settler community.

In 1983, the then-remaining British colonies, self-governing (notably Bermuda) or Crown (notably Hong Kong), were re-designated as British Dependent Territories, and in 2002 as British Overseas Territories.

==History==

=== North America (1619–1949) ===
The term &quot;self-governing colony&quot; has sometimes been used in relation to the direct rule of a Crown colony by an executive governor, elected under a limited franchise, such as in Massachusetts between 1630 and 1684.

The first local legislatures raised in the English overseas possessions were the House of Burgesses of Virginia (1619) and the House of Assembly of Bermuda (1620), originally part of Virginia. The Parliament of Bermuda, which now also includes a Senate, is the third-oldest in the Commonwealth of Nations, after the Tynwald and Westminster (currently the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Of the three, only Bermuda&#x27;s has legislated continuously, with the Royalist camp maintaining control of the archipelago during the Commonwealth of England and the Protectorate.

However, in the modern sense of the term, the first self-governing colony is generally considered to have been the Province of Canada, in 1841; the colony gained responsible government in 1849. All the colonies of British North America became self-governing between 1848 and 1855, except the Colony of Vancouver Island. Nova Scotia was the first colony to achieve responsible government in January–February 1848 through the efforts of Joseph Howe, followed by the Province of Canada later that year. They were followed by Prince Edward Island in 1851, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland in 1855 under Philip Francis Little. The Canadian colonies were federated as a Dominion in stages between 1867 and 1873, except for Newfoundland, which remained a separate self-governing colony, was a separate Dominion in 1907–1934, reverted to being a crown colony in 1934, and joined Canada in 1949. However, the term &quot;self-governing colony&quot; is not widely used by Canadian constitutional experts.

=== Australasia (1852–1907) ===
In Australasia, the term self-governing colony is widely used by historians and constitutional lawyers in relation to the political arrangements in the British settler colonies of Australasia — New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia — between 1852 and 1901, when the six colonies agreed to Federation and became a Dominion.

=== Southern Africa (1852–1980) ===
In southern Africa, the Cape Colony was granted representative government in 1852, followed by responsible government in 1872. Natal became self-governing in 1893, Transvaal in 1906 and Orange River Colony in 1908. These four colonies were united as a unitary Dominion, the Union of South Africa, in 1910). Southern Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe), became a self-governing colony in 1923.

=== Europe (1921–1964) ===
Malta was also a self-governing colony between 1921 and 1933, 1947 and 1958, and 1962 until independence two years later.

=== Singapore (1958–1963) ===
=== Dominions/Commonwealth realms ===
Dominions were self-governing entities during the mid-to-late-19th century and early 20th century, with much more autonomy than self-governing colonies. In the Dominions, prior to the Statute of Westminster in 1931, a Governor General, officially the monarch&#x27;s representative, was an officer of the British government.

After the agreement on the Balfour Declaration 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931, the Dominions were recognized as equal to the United Kingdom. After that time, the Dominions were largely free to act in matters of defence and foreign affairs, if they so chose and &quot;Dominion&quot; gradually acquired a new meaning: a state which was independent of Britain, but which shared the British monarch as the official head of state. The term Dominion has since largely fallen out of use and been replaced with the term Realm.

=== Modern times (1981–present) ===
In 1981, under the British Nationality Act 1981 and reflecting the change in status toward devolved self-government (and depriving colonials of the rights of abode and work in the United Kingdom), self-governing and Crown colonies were renamed &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot;. This terminology caused offence to both loyalists and nationalists in the territories and was changed in 2002, by the means of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, to British Overseas Territories.

<text>Bennett Alfred Cerf (May 25, 1898 – August 27, 1971) was an American writer, publisher, and co-founder of the American publishing firm Random House. Cerf was also known for his own compilations of jokes and puns, for regular personal appearances lecturing across the United States, and for his weekly television appearances for over 17 years on the panel game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;

==Early life and education==

Cerf was born on May 25, 1898, in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family of Alsatian and German ethnicity. Cerf&#x27;s father Gustave Cerf was a lithographer; his mother, Frederika Wise, was heiress to a tobacco-distribution fortune. She died when Bennett was 15; shortly afterward, her brother Herbert moved into the Cerf household and became a strong literary and social influence on the teenager.

Cerf graduated from Townsend Harris Hall Prep School in Hamilton Heights in 1916, the same public school as publisher Richard Simon, author Herman Wouk, and playwright Howard Dietz. He spent his teenage years at 790 Riverside Drive, an apartment building in Washington Heights, which was home to two of his friends who became prominent as adults: Howard Dietz and Hearst newspapers financial editor Merryle Rukeyser. Cerf received his Bachelor of Arts from Columbia College of Columbia University (1919) and his Litt.B. (1920) from its School of Journalism.

==Career==
After graduating from Columbia University, Cerf worked briefly as a reporter for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; and for some time in a Wall Street brokerage. He then was named a vice president at Boni &amp; Liveright, a publishing company.

In 1925, Cerf and Donald S. Klopfer formed a partnership to purchase the rights to the Modern Library from Boni &amp; Liveright, and they went into business for themselves. The two increased the popularity of the series, and in 1927, they began publishing general trade books that they had selected at random.

===Random House===

Cerf and Klopfer&#x27;s acquisition of Modern Library was the beginning of their publishing business, which they later named Random House. The publishing company used as its logo a little house drawn by Cerf&#x27;s friend and fellow Columbia alumnus Rockwell Kent.

Cerf&#x27;s talent in building and maintaining relationships brought contracts with such writers as William Faulkner, John O&#x27;Hara, Eugene O&#x27;Neill, James Michener, Truman Capote, Theodor Seuss Geisel, and others. He published &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; written by Ayn Rand, though he vehemently disagreed with her philosophy of Objectivism. He admired her &quot;sincerity&quot; and &quot;brillian[ce]&quot;, and the two became lifelong friends.

In 1933, Cerf won &quot;United States v. One Book Called Ulysses,&quot; a landmark court case against government censorship, and thereafter he was the first in the United States to publish James Joyce&#x27;s unabridged &quot;Ulysses&quot;. (Originally published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. One chapter from its previous serialization in Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap&#x27;s Chicago-based literary magazine, &quot;The Little Review&quot;, had led to its being found &quot;a work of obscenity&quot;.)

Random House had the rights to publish the book in the United States in 1932, and they arranged for a test case to challenge the implicit ban so as to publish the work without fear of prosecution. The publisher, therefore, made an arrangement to import the book and to have a copy seized by the United States Customs Service when it arrived. After seizure, the United States attorney took seven months before deciding whether to proceed further; although the assistant U.S. attorney assigned to assess the work&#x27;s obscenity considered it a &quot;literary masterpiece&quot;, he also felt it was obscene within the meaning of the law. The office then sued under the Tariff Act of 1930, which allowed a district attorney to bring an action against obscene literature. Cerf later presented the book in question to Columbia University.

In 1944, Cerf published the first of his books of jokes and anecdotes, &quot;Try and Stop Me&quot;, with illustrations drawn by Carl Rose. A second book, &quot;Shake Well Before Using&quot;, was published in 1949. Then, he became a member of the Peabody Awards board of jurors, where he served from 1946 to 1967 and 1970–1971. He was chair juror of the Peabody Jurors Board from 1954 to the end of his first term in 1967, and published a weekly column, &quot;The Cerf Board&quot;, in the Sunday supplement magazine &quot;This Week&quot;. Cerf was also inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa in 1967 at Florida Southern College.

In 1959, Maco Magazine Corporation published what became known as &quot;The Cream of the Master&#x27;s Crop&quot;, a compilation of Cerf&#x27;s jokes, gags, stories, puns, and wit.

==Television appearances==

Before 1951, Cerf was an occasional panelist on the NBC game show &quot;Who Said That?&quot;, on which celebrities tried to identify the speakers of quotations taken from recent news reports. In 1951, he began appearing weekly on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, where he stayed for 16 years, until the show ended its run on CBS, in 1967. Until his death, Cerf continued to appear regularly on the CBS Films (now Viacom) syndicated version of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, along with Arlene Francis. Cerf was known as &quot;Bennett Snerf&quot; in a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; puppet parody of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; During his time on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Cerf received an honorary degree from the University of Puget Sound, and an honorary doctorate of letters in November 1965 from William Jewell College, in Liberty, Missouri.

Cerf twice was a juror at the Miss America pageant.

Cerf was interviewed in 1967 and 1968 by Robin Hawkins, a freelancer working for the Oral History Research Office at Columbia University. Cerf said that he was &quot;genuinely proud of&quot; the awards that had been bestowed on him by &quot;The Yale Record&quot; and &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;.

In July 1970, Cerf was the subject of an exposé by Jessica Mitford, published in &quot;Atlantic Monthly,&quot; which denounced the business practices of the Famous Writers School, which Cerf founded.

===Characterizations===
S. J. Perelman&#x27;s 1945 feuilleton &quot;No Dearth of Mirth, Fill Out the Coupon&quot;, describes Perelman&#x27;s fictionalized encounter with a jokebook publisher named Barnaby Chirp. Perelman&#x27;s 1962 play &quot;The Beauty Part&quot; features the caricature Emmett Stagg of the book-publishing empire Charnel House, who was based on Cerf and played on Broadway by William LeMessena. He was similarly portrayed as publisher Bennett Blake on &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot; in the 1964 episode &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. In 2006, Peter Bogdanovich portrayed Cerf in the film &quot;Infamous&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cerf married actress Sylvia Sidney on October 1, 1935; they divorced six months later, on April 9, 1936.

On September 17, 1940, he married actress Phyllis Fraser, a cousin of Ginger Rogers, with whom he had two sons, Christopher and Jonathan.

In the early 1950s, while maintaining a Manhattan residence, Bennett and Phyllis Cerf bought an estate at Mount Kisco, New York, which became his country home for the rest of his life. A Mount Kisco street named Cerf Lane, named after him, runs from Croton Avenue in Mount Kisco.

==Death==
Cerf died of natural causes in Mount Kisco, on August 27, 1971, aged 73. He had undergone surgery shortly before his death. He was survived by his wife and sons.

==Legacy==
Random House published his posthumous autobiography, &quot;At Random: The Reminiscences of Bennett Cerf&quot;, in 1977, which Phyllis Cerf and a former Random House Editor Albert Erskine put together from his interviews for Columbia&#x27;s oral history program along with his diaries and scrapbooks.

Bennett Cerf Drive, just outside the City of Westminster in Carroll County, Maryland, is named after him. This is the location of the Random House Westminster Distribution Center and Offices, one of two Random House distribution facilities in the U.S., as well as the location of Bennett Cerf Park.

<text>USS &quot;Winjah&quot; (CVE-54) (originally AVG-54, later ACV-54), was a of the United States Navy, leased to the Royal Navy during World War II.

&quot;Winjah&quot; was laid down on 5 June 1943 at Tacoma, Washington, by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding. She was assigned to the United Kingdom under lend-lease on 23 June; she was redesignated CVE-54 on 15 July; launched on 22 November; and delivered to the British on 18 February 1944. From March to August 1945 she was part of the British Pacific Fleet attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron.

Renamed HMS &quot;Reaper&quot; (D82), the carrier operated in the Royal Navy for the duration of World War II. After arriving at Norfolk, Virginia, on 13 May 1946, &quot;Reaper&quot; was decommissioned on 20 May and returned to the United States Government. Authorized for disposal on 14 June, &quot;Winjah&quot; was struck from the Navy Registry on 8 July and sold to the Waterman Steamship Company of Mobile, Alabama, on 12 February 1947 as &quot;South Africa Star&quot;. She was scrapped in Japan in May 1967.

Just after World War II, &quot;Reaper&quot; was responsible for bringing from Cherbourg Harbour many examples of former German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; aircraft captured by the American military&#x27;s Operation Lusty over to North America, such as the sole examples of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance bomber, and the Heinkel He 219 night fighter, that exist in American aviation museums in the 21st century. The aircraft arrived by air from Germany to Querqueville Airfield which is under a kilometer away from Cherbourg.

==Design and description==
These ships were larger and had a greater aircraft capacity than all the preceding American built escort carriers. They were also all laid down as escort carriers and not converted merchant ships. All the ships had a complement of 646 men and an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Propulsion was provided by two boilers and a steam turbine connected to one shaft, giving 9,350 shaft horsepower (SHP), which could propel the ship at .
Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge/flight control on the starboard side, two aircraft lifts by , one aircraft catapult and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the by hangar below the flight deck. Her armament comprised: two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 Dual Purpose guns in single mounts, sixteen 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty 20 mm Oerlikon anti-aircraft cannons in single mounts. The ship had a maximum aircraft capacity of twenty-four aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlets, Vought F4U Corsairs or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine torpedo bombers.

<text>Jean-Luc Nancy ( ; ; 26 July 1940 – 23 August 2021) was a French philosopher. Nancy&#x27;s first book, published in 1973, was &quot;Le titre de la lettre&quot; (&quot;The Title of the Letter&quot;, 1992), a reading of the work of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, written in collaboration with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe. Nancy is the author of works on many thinkers, including &quot;La remarque spéculative&quot; in 1973 (&quot;The Speculative Remark&quot;, 2001) on Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, &quot;Le Discours de la syncope&quot; (1976) and &quot;L&#x27;Impératif catégorique&quot; (1983) on Immanuel Kant, &quot;Ego sum&quot; (1979) on René Descartes, and &quot;Le Partage des voix&quot; (1982) on Martin Heidegger.

In addition to &quot;Le titre de la lettre&quot;, Nancy collaborated with Lacoue-Labarthe on several other books and articles. Nancy is credited with helping to reopen the question of the ground of community and politics with his 1985 work &quot;La communauté désoeuvrée&quot; (&quot;The Inoperative Community&quot;), following Blanchot&#x27;s &quot;The Unavowable Community&quot; (1983) and Agamben responded to both with &quot;The Coming Community&quot; (1990). One of the very few monographs that Jacques Derrida ever wrote on a contemporary philosopher is &quot;On Touching, Jean-Luc Nancy&quot;.

== Biography ==
Jean-Luc Nancy graduated in philosophy in 1962 from the University of Paris. He taught for a short while in Colmar before becoming an assistant at the Strasbourg Institut de Philosophie in 1968. In 1973, he received his doctorate with a dissertation on Kant under the supervision of Paul Ricœur. Nancy was then promoted to &quot;Maître de conférences&quot; (associate professor) at the Université des Sciences Humaines de Strasbourg. In the 1970s and 1980s, Nancy was a guest professor at universities all over the world, from the University of California to the Freie Universität in Berlin. He has been invited as a cultural delegate of the French Ministry of External Affairs to speak in Eastern Europe, Britain and the United States. In 1987, Nancy became a &quot;Docteur d&#x27;État&quot; at the Université de Toulouse-Le-Mirail for a thesis on freedom in Heidegger under the supervision of Gérard Granel. The jury was composed of Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Derrida. It was published as &quot;L&#x27;expérience de la liberté&quot; (1988).

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Nancy suffered serious medical problems. He underwent a heart transplant and his recovery was made more difficult by a long-term cancer diagnosis. He stopped teaching and participating in almost all of the committees with which he was engaged, but continued to write. Many of his best known texts were published during this time. An account of his experience, &quot;L&#x27;intrus&quot; (&quot;The Intruder&quot;), was published in 2000. Nancy was a professor at the University of Strasbourg. Nancy was also Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Chair and Professor of Philosophy at The European Graduate School.

Filmmaker Claire Denis has made at least two movies inspired by Jean-Luc Nancy and his works. Many other artists have worked with Nancy as well, such as Simon Hantaï, Soun-gui Kim and Phillip Warnell. Nancy has written about the filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami and featured prominently in the film &quot;The Ister&quot;.

Nancy died on 23 August 2021 at the age of 81.

== Major works ==

===&quot;Les Fins de l&#x27;homme&quot;===
In 1980, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe organized a conference at Centre culturel international de Cerisy-la-Salle on Derrida and politics entitled &quot;Les Fins de l&#x27;homme&quot; (&quot;The Ends of Man&quot;). The conference solidified Derrida&#x27;s place at the forefront of contemporary philosophy, and was a place to begin an in-depth conversation between philosophy and contemporary politics. Further to their desire to rethink the political, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe set up in the same year the &quot;Centre de Recherches Philosophiques sur la Politique&quot; (Centre for Philosophical Research on the Political). The centre was dedicated to pursuing philosophical rather than empirical approaches to political questions, and supported such speakers as Claude Lefort and Jean-François Lyotard. By 1984, however, Nancy and Lacoue-Labarthe were dissatisfied with the direction work at the centre was taking, and it was closed down.

During that period Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy produced several important papers, together and separately. Some of these texts appear in &quot;Les Fins de l&#x27;homme à partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 août 1980&quot; (1981), &quot;Rejouer le politique&quot; (1981), &quot;La retrait du politique&quot; (1983), and &quot;Le mythe nazi&quot; (1991, revised edition; originally published as &quot;Les méchanismes du fascisme&quot;, 1981). Many of these texts are gathered in translation in &quot;Retreating the Political&quot; (1997).

===&quot;La Communauté désœuvrée&quot;===
Nancy&#x27;s first book on the question of community, &quot;La Communauté désœuvrée&quot; (&quot;The Inoperative Community&quot;, 1986), is perhaps his best-known work. This text is an introduction to some of the main philosophical themes Nancy continued to work with. Nancy traces the influence of the notion of community to concepts of experience, discourse, and the individual, and argues that it has dominated modern thought. Discarding popular notions, Nancy redefines community, asking what can it be if it is reduced neither to a collection of separate individuals, nor to a hypostasized communal substance, e.g., fascism. He writes that our attempt to design society according to pre-planned definitions frequently leads to social violence and political terror, posing the social and political question of how to proceed with the development of society with this knowledge in mind. &quot;La Communauté désœuvrée&quot; means that community is not the result of a production, be it social, economic or even political (nationalist) production; it is not &quot;une œuvre&quot;, a &quot;work of art&quot; (&quot;œuvre d&#x27;art&quot;, but &quot;art&quot; is here understood in the sense of &quot;artifice&quot;).

===&quot;L&#x27;Expérience de la liberté&quot;===
Nancy&#x27;s dissertation for his &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; looked at the works of Kant, Schelling, Sartre and Heidegger, and concentrated on their treatment of the topic of freedom. It was published in 1988 as &quot;L&#x27;Expérience de la Liberté&quot; (&quot;The Experience of Freedom&quot;). Since then, Nancy has continued to concentrate on developing a reorientation of Heidegger&#x27;s work. Nancy treats freedom as a property of the individual or collectivity, and looks for a &quot;non-subjective&quot; freedom which would attempt to think the existential or origin for every freedom. Nancy argues that it is necessary to think freedom in its finite being, because to think of it as the property of an infinite subject is to make any finite being a limit of freedom. The existence of the other is the necessary condition of freedom, rather than its limitation.

===&quot;Le sens du monde&quot;===
Nancy addresses the world in its contemporary global configuration in other writings on freedom, justice and sovereignty. In his 1993 book &quot;Le sens du monde&quot; (&quot;The Sense of the World&quot;), he asks what we mean by saying that we live in one world, and how our sense of the world is changed by saying that it is situated within the world, rather than above or apart from it. To Nancy, the world, or existence, is our ontological responsibility, which precedes political, judicial and moral responsibility. He describes our being in the world as an exposure to a naked existence, without the possibility of support by a fundamental metaphysical order or cause. Contemporary existence no longer has recourse to a divine framework, as was the case in feudal society where the meaning and course of life was predetermined. The contingency of our naked existence as an ontological question is the main challenge of our existence in contemporary global society.

All of these themes relating to world are taken up again by Nancy in his 2002 book &quot;La création du monde ou la mondialisation&quot; (&quot;The Creation of the World or Globalization&quot;), where he makes the distinction between globalization as a deterministic process and mondialisation as an open-ended &quot;world-forming&quot; process. Here, he connects his critique with Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy, which saw &quot;free labour&quot; as what produces the world. Nancy argues that an authentic &quot;dwelling&quot; in the world must be concerned with the creation of meaning (enjoyment) and not final purposes, closed essences, and exclusive worldviews. The present system of expanding cities and nodes in the planetary techno-scientific network (tied to capitalism) leads to the loss of world, because the world is treated as an object (globe), even though the self-deconstruction of ontotheology increasingly made it the &quot;subject&quot; of its own creation.

=== &quot;Être singulier pluriel&quot; ===
In his book &quot;Être singulier pluriel&quot; (&quot;Being Singular Plural&quot;, 2000), Nancy tackles the question of how we can speak of a plurality of a &quot;we&quot; without making the &quot;we&quot; a singular identity. The premise of the title essay in this book is that there is no being without &quot;being-with,&quot; that &quot;I&quot; does not come before &quot;we&quot; (i.e., &quot;Dasein&quot; does not precede &quot;Mitsein&quot;) and that there is no existence without co-existence. In an extension from his thoughts on freedom, community, and the sense of the world, he imagines the &quot;being-with&quot; as a mutual exposure to one another that preserves the freedom of the &quot;I&quot;, and thus a community that is not subject to an exterior or pre-existent definition.

The five essays that follow the title piece continue to develop Nancy&#x27;s philosophy through discussions of sovereignty, war and technology, ecotechnics, identity, the Gulf War and Sarajevo. Nancy&#x27;s central concern in these essays remains the &quot;being-with&quot;, which he uses to discuss issues of psychoanalysis, politics and multiculturalism, looking at notions of &quot;self&quot; and &quot;other&quot; in current contexts.

== Artistic analysis ==
Nancy has also written for art catalogues and international art journals, especially on contemporary art. He also writes poetry and for the theatre and has earned respect as an influential philosopher of art and culture. In his book &quot;Les Muses&quot; published in 1994 (&quot;The Muses&quot;, 1996), he begins with an analysis of Hegel&#x27;s thesis on the death of art. Among the essays in &quot;The Muses&quot; is a piece on Caravaggio, originally a lecture given at the Louvre. In this essay, Nancy looks for a different conception of painting where painting is not a representation of the empirical world, but a presentation of the world, of sense, or of existence. Nancy has published books on film and music, as well as texts on the problem of representation, on the statute of literature, on image and violence, and on the work of On Kawara, Charles Baudelaire, and Friedrich Hölderlin.

==Film theory==
Nancy&#x27;s text &quot;L&#x27;intrus&quot; formed the basis for French director Claire Denis&#x27;s film of the same name.

He has written extensively on film, including &quot;The Evidence of Film,&quot; a short work on Abbas Kiarostami.

Nancy appears in the film &quot;The Ister&quot;, based on Martin Heidegger&#x27;s 1942 lectures on Friedrich Hölderlin&#x27;s poem &quot;Der Ister&quot; (published as &quot;Hölderlin&#x27;s Hymn &quot;The Ister&quot;&quot;). The film focuses on the relation of politics, technology and myth.

Nancy has developed three films in conjunction with artist-filmmaker Phillip Warnell. He appears in their 2009 film Outlandish: &#x27;Strange Foreign Bodies&#x27;, which also features a text he wrote specifically for the project, Étranges Corps Étrangers. Nancy contributed a poem, &#x27;Oh The Animals of Language&#x27; to Warnell&#x27;s 2014 feature-length film &#x27;Ming of Harlem: Twenty One Storeys in the Air&#x27;. Warnell and Nancy worked on a new text-film collaboration which was completed in 2017, &#x27;The Flying Proletarian&#x27;.

<text>Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore in the County of Stafford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1897 for the prominent brewer, philanthropist and Liberal politician Michael Bass, 1st Baron Burton. He had already been created a baronet in 1882 and Baron Burton in 1886. However, the three titles had different remainders. The Bass family descended from William Bass, who founded the brewery business of Bass &amp; Co in Burton upon Trent in 1777. His grandson Michael Thomas Bass transformed the company into one of the largest breweries in the United Kingdom. He also represented Derby in Parliament as a Liberal for thirty-five years and was a great benefactor to the town of Burton. However, Bass declined every honour offered to him, including a baronetcy and a peerage.

His son, Michael Arthur Bass, was also involved with the family business (which now had become Bass, Ratcliff, Gretton and Co), and sat as Liberal Member of Parliament for Stafford, East Staffordshire and Burton. Like his father he was also a benefactor of Burton. In 1882 Bass was created a Baronet of Stafford in the County of Stafford, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The title was in honour of his father (who was then still alive), and was created with remainder to his younger brother Hamar Alfred Bass. In 1886 Bass was further honoured when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Burton, of Rangemore and of Burton-on-Trent in the County of Stafford, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. In 1897 he was also created Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent and of Rangemore in the County of Stafford, with remainder, in default of male issue, to his daughter and her issue male. On Lord Burton&#x27;s death in 1909 he was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet, on whose death in 1952 the title became extinct.

The barony of 1886 became extinct as he had no sons, while he was succeeded in the barony of 1897 according to the special remainder by his daughter Nellie Lisa Baillie, the second Baroness. She was the wife of Colonel James Evan Bruce Baillie (d. 1931) of Dochfour in Inverness-shire. After her first husband&#x27;s death she married as her second husband Major William Eugene Melles (d. 1953). Her eldest son from her first marriage, George Evan Michael Baillie, was a Brigadier in the British Army, but was killed during the Second World War. Lady Burton was therefore succeeded by her grandson (the son of George Evan Michael Baillie), the third holder of the barony. He was notably a member of the Inverness-shire County Council and of the Inverness District Council and also served as Deputy Lieutenant of Inverness-shire.

From about 1870, Glenquoich Estate was rented by Lord Burton, and &quot;at his hands it has had careful nursing, with all the benefits and advantages of large outlays in numerous improvements, for even in the single matter of roads alone upwards of a hundred and thirty miles of carriage drives and pony tracks have been made, by which means the lodge on the shore of Loch Quoich has been placed in communication with all parts of the deer ground&quot;. Glenquoich is a very large sporting estate west of Invergarry, Inverness-shire.

<text>Baron Burnham, of Hall Barn in the Parish of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 31 July 1903 for the influential newspaper magnate Sir Edward Levy-Lawson, 1st Baronet, owner of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He had already been created a Baronet, of Hall Barn in The Parish of Beaconsfield in the County of Buckingham and of Peterborough Court in the City of London, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 13 October 1892. Levy-Lawson was the son of Joseph Moses Levy, who acquired &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; only months after its founding.

Lord Burnham was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He followed his father in the management and ownership of the newspaper, but sold it in 1928 to Lord Camrose and partners. Lord Burnham also sat as a Member of Parliament. On 16 May 1919, he was created Viscount Burnham, of Hall Barn in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

However, he had no surviving male issue and the viscountcy became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his younger brother, the third Baron. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Baron. He was a Major-General in the Territorial Army. His younger son, the sixth Baron (who succeeded his elder brother in 1993), was active on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served as a Deputy Speaker between 1995 and 2001 and 2002 and 2005 and as Conservative Deputy Chief Whip from 1997 to 2001. Lord Burnham was one of the 90 elected hereditary peers who were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. , the title is held by his son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2005.

The family retained an interest in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; after it was sold in 1928. The fourth Baron and his son the sixth Baron were both executives of the newspaper until the Camrose interests were in turn displaced by Conrad Black in 1986.

The first Baron&#x27;s sons retained the name Levy-Lawson though predominantly using Lawson, and the fourth Baron was registered with it at birth, but subsequently they have used Lawson only.

<text>Bernard William Tucker ( - ) was an English ornithologist. He was lecturer in zoology at Oxford University, a long-time editor of British Birds and one of the authors of &quot;The Handbook of British Birds&quot;. He was the first Secretary of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) and founder of the Oxford Ornithological Society in 1921.

Tucker was born at Northaw, Hertfordshire to William and Constance Susan Tucker and was educated at Harrow School and Magdalen College, Oxford, gaining first class honours in 1923. He took an interest in birds even as a young boy. He spent 1924 at the Zoological Station in Naples investigating parasitism in crustaceans. In 1925 he was appointed Demonstrator in the Zoological Laboratory, Cambridge. In 1926 he became Demonstrator in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy at Oxford University. In 1946 he became the first person to be appointed as a reader in ornithology in a British University. Tucker along with Max Nicholson played a key role in leading the collaborative Oxford Bird Census in 1927. According to the Nicholson and J D Witherby in their obituary, Tucker was &quot;the least dramatic of men, but he did much to bring about a revolution in ornithology and to guard it against the reaction which awaits a revolution if it goes too far and too fast.&quot;

During his stint in Naples he met Gladys Allen whom he married on 11 July 1925.

A subspecies of the Bornean treepie was named after him as &quot;Dendrocitta sinensis tuckeri&quot; by Tom Harrisson and C.H. Hartley in 1934 but this is no longer considered a valid subspecies. The BTO awards a &quot;Bernard Tucker Medal&quot; in his memory.

<text>Baron Biddulph, of Ledbury in the County of Hereford, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 1 August 1903 for the banker and politician Michael Biddulph. He was a partner in the London banking firm of Cocks, Biddulph and Co and also sat in the House of Commons for Herefordshire as a Liberal from 1868 to 1885 and for Ross from 1885 to 1900 as a Liberal Unionist. His father Robert Biddulph had previously represented Hereford in Parliament while his younger brother Sir Robert Biddulph was Governor of Gibraltar. the title is held by the first Baron&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1988. In 1978 he assumed the additional surname of Maitland, which is the maiden surname of his mother, Lady Mary Helena Maitland, granddaughter of Ian Colin Maitland, 15th Earl of Lauderdale. She is a Patroness of the Royal Caledonian Ball.

The Barons Biddulph are related to the Biddulph baronets of Westcombe. The first Baron Biddulph was a descendant of Anthony Biddulph, uncle of Sir Theophilus Biddulph, 1st Baronet, of Westcombe.

<doc id="510871" wikidata="Q1769502" url="?curid=510871" title="Michiana">
<text>Michiana ( ) is a region in northern Indiana and southwestern Michigan centered on the city of South Bend, Indiana. The Chamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County, Indiana defines Michiana as St. Joseph County and &quot;counties that contribute at least 500 inbound commuting workers to St. Joseph County daily.&quot; Those counties include Elkhart, La Porte, Marshall, St. Joseph, and Starke in Indiana, and Berrien and Cass in Michigan. As of the 2020 census, those seven counties had a population of 867,747 (661,842 in Indiana and 205,905 in Michigan).

The name is a portmanteau of &quot;Michigan&quot; and &quot;Indiana&quot; and was chosen as the winning entry, purportedly submitted by Indiana politician Thurman C. Crook, among others, in a contest to name the area held by the Associated South Bend Merchants in 1934. The term is frequently used throughout the area, particularly by local radio and television stations based in South Bend that serve the entire area, but also by businesses that seek to draw customers from Indiana into Michigan or vice versa. A 2016 report stated that residents in the Michigan portion are particularly fond of the term because it contains part of the state name as opposed to generic terms for the area such as &quot;the South Bend region.&quot;

==Government==
The Michiana Area Council of Governments (MACOG) is the official Metropolitan Planning Organization for north central Indiana and the South Bend-Mishawaka metropolitan area. MACOG conducts planning for transportation, water quality, and economic development. Currently, 22 cities and towns as well as 29 townships participate in MACOG. Despite the Michiana name, none of these participants are currently from the state of Michigan, although Berrien and Cass Counties were until they along with Van Buren County were combined into their own MPO, what is now called the Southwest Michigan Planning Commission.

==Counties==

* St. Joseph County: Population: 272,912 (as of 2020)

==Greater Michiana==
Greater Michiana includes the following 15 counties in Indiana and Michigan:

The Chamber of Commerce of St. Joseph County (Indiana) defines Greater Michiana as &quot;counties within a 60-mile driving distance to St. Joseph County&quot; that are not included in the seven counties making up Michiana &quot;proper.&quot; However, the driving distance presumably refers to the distance between the metropolitan South Bend area and significant population centers in outlying areas, since a strict definition allowing for 60 miles from any point in St. Joseph County would add even more counties to the Greater Michiana area. For example, Walkerton in southwestern St. Joseph County is located approximately 30 miles from Monterey in northeastern Pulaski County, yet Pulaski is not included in the Chamber&#x27;s list of Greater Michiana counties.

Because Michiana is not a legal or political entity, opinions differ about what counties and communities constitute the region. Some definitions of the entire Michiana area include fewer than 15 counties; others include Pulaski County and exclude some other outlying counties, notably, those in extreme Northwest Indiana, whose residents identify more closely with Chicago than with the South Bend area.

Michiana&#x27;s borders overlap with those of the Chicago metropolitan area, and the two regions have significant cultural ties. South Bend in particular has strong ties to Chicago: it is home to the last stop on the South Shore Line, a commuter rail line connecting Chicago&#x27;s downtown and south side to Indiana, and the nearby University of Notre Dame is noted for its strong connection with Chicago. Berrien County, Michigan, is known as a common summer vacation destination for wealthy Chicagoans; the Wall Street Journal called the area &quot;the Hamptons of the Midwest&quot;.

==Economy==
Throughout the twentieth century, the economy of Michiana was based on heavy industry, especially as connected to the automobile industry centered in nearby Detroit. In 1960, 41% of the employment was in manufacturing, followed by 17% in hospitality 8% in business services, 6% in transportation, 5% in education, and 5% in agriculture, with healthcare at 4% and government at 2%. Deindustrialization had a major impact after 1970, and by 2013, only 27% of the employment was in manufacturing, 20% was in hospitality, 12% in healthcare, 11% in government, 8% in business services, 5% in transportation, and 4% in education. In 2013, three of the top 10 Michiana employers were in the Elkhart area and focused on recreational vehicles, trailers, and related products, including Forest River with 7600 employees, Thor Industries with 7500, and Drew industries with 4700. Many hospitals were consolidated, as health spending doubled and tripled. By 2013 three health systems were among the top 10 employers: Beacon Health System (7000 employees; based in Elkhart and South Bend); Lakeland Regional Health System (4100 employees; based in St. Joseph and Niles), and Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center (2700; based in Mishawaka and Plymouth). The University of Notre Dame had 5700 employees in the educational sector, and the South Bend Community School Corporation had 3000. Whirlpool Corporation, the appliance maker, with 3400 employees, is based in Benton Harbor. Martin&#x27;s Super Markets operated 21 grocery stores in the region with 3100 employees. With the loss of manufacturing, per capita income in Michiana has declined from 105% of the national average in 1960 to 82% in 2013.

<text>Baron Beaverbrook, of Beaverbrook in the Province of New Brunswick in the Dominion of Canada and of Cherkley in the County of Surrey, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1917 for the prominent media owner and politician Sir Max Aitken, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Cherkley in the County of Surrey, on 3 July 1916. When Aitken died, his son disclaimed the barony three days later, stating that &quot;there shall only be one Lord Beaverbrook in my lifetime&quot;. Since 1985, the title has been held by the latter&#x27;s son, the third Baron.

The first Baron Beaverbrook&#x27;s daughter, Janet Gladys Aitken, was the mother of John Edward Aitken Kidd. He is the father of Jemma Wellesley, Marchioness of Douro, and Jodie Kidd. Another member of the Aitken family is the Conservative politician Jonathan Aitken, who is the great-nephew of the first Baron Beaverbrook.

The family seat is Denchworth Manor, near Wantage in Oxfordshire. Replicas of the first Baron&#x27;s two favourite cats can be viewed in the public research room of the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick.

<doc id="510877" wikidata="Q495729" url="?curid=510877" title="King's German Legion">
<text>The King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL; ) was a formation of the British Army during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Consisting primarily of expatriate Germans, it existed from 1803 to 1816 and achieved the distinction of being the only German military force to fight without interruption against the French and their allies during the Napoleonic Wars.

Formed within months of the French dissolution of the Electorate of Hanover in 1803, the KGL was constituted as a combined arms corps by the end of the year. Although it never fought autonomously and remained a part of the British army for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars, the KGL played a vital role in several campaigns, most notably the Peninsular War, Walcheren Campaign and Hundred Days.

The KGL was disbanded in 1816, and many of its units were incorporated into the Hanoverian Army, which later became part of the Imperial German Army after the unification of Germany into the German Empire 1871. The British German Legion, raised during the Crimean War, has sometimes been erroneously referred to as the &quot;King&#x27;s German Legion&quot;.

== History ==
After the occupation of Hanover by Napoleonic troops the Convention of Artlenburg, also called the Convention of the Elbe, was signed on 5 July 1803 and formally dissolved the Electorate of Hanover. Consequently, the Elector&#x27;s army was disbanded. Many former Hanoverian officers and soldiers fled the French occupation of Hanover to Britain; George III, the deposed Elector of Hanover, was also King of the United Kingdom.
The same year, Major Colin Halkett and Colonel Johann Friedrich von der Decken were issued warrants to raise a corps of light infantry, to be named &quot;The King&#x27;s German Regiment&quot;. On 19 December 1803, Halkett&#x27;s and von der Decken&#x27;s levies were combined as a basis of a mixed corps (includes all arms: mounted, infantry, artillery) renamed the King&#x27;s German Legion. The KGL infantry were quartered in Bexhill-on-Sea and the cavalry in Weymouth, Dorset. Some units were involved in a street fight in Tullamore, Ireland with a British Light infantry unit in the so-called &quot;Battle of Tullamore.&quot;

The number of officers and other ranks grew over time to approximately 14,000, but during the 13 years of its existence, close to 28,000 men served in the legion at one time or another. Initially, most of the officers were appointed with temporary rank, but in 1812 all the officers of the legion were given permanent rank in the British Army for &quot;having so frequently distinguished themselves against the enemy&quot;. It saw active service as an integral part of the British Army from 1805 to 1816, after which its units were disbanded. In November 1813 Hanover was liberated from French rule and the Hanoverian Army revived. At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 two distinct Hanoverian forcesthe KGL and the Hanoverian Armyserved under the Duke of Wellington.

* 1st Line Battalion
* 2nd Line Battalion
* 3rd Line Battalion
* 4th Line Battalion

* 7th Line Battalion
* 8th Line Battalion

===Artillery and engineers===
* King&#x27;s German Artillery
** 2 horse batteries
** 4 foot batteries
* King&#x27;s German Engineers

== Campaigns ==
Although the legion never fought autonomously or as a single unit, its units participated in campaigns in Hanover, Pomerania, Copenhagen and Walcheren, the Peninsular War under General Sir John Moore; and the retreat to Corunna; the Peninsular Campaign under the Duke of Wellington, including the battles of Bussaco, Barrosa, Fuentes de Onoro, Albuera, Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca, Garcia Hernandez, Burgos, Venta del Pozo, Vittoria, San Sebastian, Nivelle, Orthez, Sicily, and the eastern parts of Spain, Northern Germany and Göhrde.

In the Peninsular Campaign, the Germans enhanced the veteran core of the British army. At Sabugal, in April 1811, several hundred German hussars augmented the Light Division, and the Hussars found the proper ford of the Coa River.
 At the Battle of Garcia Hernandez, the Dragoons performed the unusual feat of smashing two French square formations in a matter of minutes.
At the Battle of Waterloo, the 2nd Light Battalion – with members of the 1st Light Battalion and the 5th Line Battalion – defended the farmhouse and road at La Haye Sainte. As the 5th Line Battalion under Oberst Ompteda
was on its way to reinforce the defenders of Haye Sainte, the French cavalry attached to Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s Corp I rode them down; only a few of the intended relievers survived. After a six-hour defence, without ammunition, or reinforcements, the Germans were forced to abandon the farm, leaving the buildings in shambles and their dead behind.

== Legacy ==
The legion was known for its excellent discipline and fighting ability. The cavalry was reputed to be among the best in the British army. According to the historian Alessandro Barbero, the King&#x27;s German Legion &quot;had such a high degree of professionalism that it was considered equal in every way to the best British units.&quot; After the victory at Waterloo, the Electorate of Hanover was re-founded as the Kingdom of Hanover. However, the Army of Hanover had been reconstituted even before the final battle, so that there were two Hanoverian armies in existence including at the Battle of Waterloo. In 1816 the legion was dissolved and some officers and men were integrated into the new Hanoverian army.

<text>Kirk Cyron Johnson (born June 29, 1972) is a Canadian former professional boxer who competed from 1993 to 2010, and challenged once for the WBA heavyweight title in 2002.

==Amateur career==
Johnson represented Canada at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, where he lost in the quarter-finals against eventual silver medallist David Izon (Nigeria).

==Professional career==
Johnson had his first professional bout on April 24, 1993, against Andre Smiley.

In his first title fight in 2002 Johnson faced John Ruiz for the WBA Heavyweight Title. In the tenth round Johnson was disqualified for low blows while losing on all of the judges&#x27; scorecards. Johnson appealed the disqualification to the WBA, on the grounds that referee Joe Cortez had erred in calling some of the low blows and did not act impartially (both Ruiz and Cortez are of Puerto Rican descent). Though many boxing commentators agreed that the disqualification was unwarranted, the appeal was ultimately denied by the WBA.

On December 6, 2003, Johnson faced the Ukrainian contender and future champion Vitali Klitschko in New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. He was easily defeated by Klitschko, losing by a second-round knockout.

Johnson compounded the Klitschko embarrassment by coming into this fight at 260 pounds — an all-time high for him. Johnson weighed 232 pounds in his biggest win, over future WBC Heavyweight Champion Oleg Maskaev, in 2000.

===Comeback===
After the Klitschko fight, Johnson staged a comeback. He knocked out Mexican heavyweight Gilbert Martinez in July 2004 and won a technical decision over Cuban Yanqui Díaz in June 2005, although he lost his next bout (later changed to a technical decision) against Californian Javier Mora in March 2006. Mora appeared to have accidentally stepped on Johnson&#x27;s foot, causing Johnson to dislocate his knee. This decision was subsequently appealed and the result changed to a No Decision. Johnson has since recovered from his knee injury.

On April 29, 2010, Johnson returned to the ring after a four-year absence and fought journeyman Douglas Robertson defeating him via first-round TKO.

Johnson finished his career with a record of 37–2–1 (27 KOs), with one no contest.

==Halifax Regional Police lawsuit==
In 2003, after dropping out of a planned fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis because of an injury, Johnson launched a protracted legal battle against the Halifax Regional Police. During the inquiry, Johnson claimed that because of racism and racial profiling by the Halifax Regional Police he had his car stopped 28 times over five years while in Halifax. Johnson was awarded $10,000 in damages, in addition to $4,790 to cover his travel expenses. The police service was also ordered to create a scholarship in Johnson&#x27;s name. It is awarded annually to a student from North Preston. Since 2003, 16 students have received awards.
