<text>Donald Herod Peterson (October 22, 1933 – May 27, 2018) was a United States Air Force officer and NASA astronaut. Peterson was originally selected for the Air Force Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program, but, when that was canceled, he became a NASA astronaut in September 1969. He was a mission specialist on STS-6 on board &quot;Challenger&quot;. During the mission Peterson performed a spacewalk to test the new airlock and space suits. He logged 120 hours in space. Peterson retired from NASA in 1984.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Donald Peterson was born in Winona, Mississippi, on October 22, 1933. Peterson graduated from Winona High School in 1951. One of his high school teachers said, &quot;I never did hear any adverse criticism of him by students or teachers. He was just superior.&quot;

Peterson desired financial help for college, and after listening to a Navy recruiter&#x27;s speech, elected to join a service academy. He enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1955, electing to join the Air Force. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant.

After working with Air Training Command until 1960, he was asked if he would be interested in getting a degree in nuclear engineering so he could join a program involving aircraft powered by a nuclear reactor. He enrolled in nuclear engineering at the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology of Air University. Six months before graduation, the program was cancelled. He earned his Master of Science degree in 1962. He also worked towards his Ph.D. at the University of Texas.

===USAF career===
After graduating from West Point in 1955, his assignments included four years as a flight instructor and military training officer with the Air Training Command, three years as a nuclear systems analyst with the Air Force Systems Command, and one year as a fighter pilot with Tactical Air Command, including three months of combat weapons training.

He was a graduate of the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was one of the third group of astronauts assigned to the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program.

He logged over 5,300 hours flying time, including more than 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.

===NASA career===

Peterson became part of NASA Astronaut Group 7 in September 1969 after the MOL program was cancelled. He served on the astronaut support crew for Apollo 16.

Peterson retired from the United States Air Force with the rank of colonel after having completed more than 24 years of active service, but continued his assignment as a NASA astronaut in a civilian capacity. His areas of responsibility included engineering support, man/machine interface, and safety assessment.

Medical issues likely prevented Peterson from training as a space shuttle pilot. He was a mission specialist on STS-6, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 4, 1983. He was accompanied by Paul J. Weitz (spacecraft commander), Col. Karol J. Bobko (Pilot), and Dr. Story Musgrave (Mission Specialist). The crew had a combined 111 years of flying experience and an average age of 48 years and 5 months. The crew was dubbed &quot;The Geritol Bunch&quot; for their high experience.

During this maiden voyage of the spacecraft &quot;Challenger&quot;, the STS-6 crew conducted numerous experiments in materials processing, recorded lightning activities, deployed the first tracking and data relay satellite (TDRS-A), and activated three Getaway Specials. Peterson and Musgrave conducted the Shuttle program&#x27;s first extravehicular activity (EVA) to test the new suit, the Shuttle airlock, and new tools and techniques for construction and repair outside a spacecraft. After 120 hours of orbital operations STS-6 landed on the concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 9, 1983. With the completion of this flight, Don Peterson had logged 4 hours 15 minutes in extravehicular activity and a total of 120 hours in space.

===Post-NASA career===
Peterson resigned from the NASA Astronaut Corps in November 1984 and worked as a consultant in the area of crewed aerospace operations.

===Personal life and death===
Peterson married Bonnie Ruth Love in 1957. They had three children. She died in 2017. He died on May 27, 2018, at his home in El Lago, Texas, of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and bone cancer, at the age of 84.

==Honors==
He was awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the JSC Group Achievement Award (1972).

<text>The MKM Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Kingston upon Hull, England. It has a current capacity of 25,586. The stadium is home to both association football club Hull City A.F.C. of the EFL Championship and rugby league club Hull F.C. of the Super League.

It was previously known as the KC Stadium, but was renamed the KCOM Stadium as part of a major rebrand on 4 April 2016 by the stadium&#x27;s sponsor KCOM. In June 2021, it was renamed to its current name, the MKM Stadium, as part of a five-year sponsorship with MKM Building Supplies. During UEFA competitions, the stadium is known as the Hull City Stadium due to sponsorship regulations.

Conceived in the late 1990s, it was completed in 2002 at a cost of approximately £44 million. The stadium is owned by Hull City Council and operated by the Stadium Management Company (SMC), who have previously considered expanding the stadium capacity up to 34,000. The bowl-shaped stadium contains a continuous single tier of seats with a second tier on the west side.

The stadium occasionally hosts international association football and rugby league competitions and acts as a venue for concerts by musical artists. Previous performances at the stadium include Elton John and The Who.

==History==

The idea of a new stadium for Kingston upon Hull, whose professional football club Hull City had played at Boothferry Park since 1946, was first mooted in 1997. However, funds to finance such a project only became available when the city council sold a portion of its holdings in Kingston Communications. The council provided most of the funds, more than £42 million, with the rest stemming from government single regeneration budget grants and from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund.

The council appointed John Topliss to head the stadium construction project. He and his team partnered with consulting firm Drivers Jonas to explore preliminary issues such as stadium location, seating capacity, and facilities offered. Topliss stated that his team had &quot;a totally blank canvas&quot; and by working with consultants they made &quot;a thorough assessment&quot; of what was needed.

The project team considered over a dozen sites, inside and outside of the city, before settling on The Circle in West Park. Factors contributing to the decision include transport guidance, central government planning guidelines, existing athletic facilities, isolation from residential areas, and council ownership. The stadium site is located around from the original &#x27;Circle&#x27; Stadium, one of Hull City&#x27;s previous home grounds.
The final recommendation of Drivers Jonas included additional facilities for both indoor and outdoor sports for the people of West Hull in addition to the main stadium, planned to seat from 25,000 to 30,000 spectators. Professional services firm Arup Associates provided initial concept proposals for the stadium. The Miller Partnership, an architectural and interior design firm, adopted these proposals during the stadium&#x27;s design. The construction work was undertaken by Birse Group.

There were a handful of obstacles during the course of the project, including Hull City A.F.C.&#x27;s receivership in 2001, just after the granting of planning permission. Despite this, the stadium complex was completed on time after fourteen months of work and on budget, sitting at approximately £44 million. The stadium officially opened its doors on 18 December 2002.

That day, there were 22,467 spectators in attendance as Hull City beat Sunderland A.F.C. 1–0 in a friendly match to mark the occasion. Steve Melton scored the only goal of the game, consequently the first at the new stadium. Furthermore, the clubs contested for the &#x27;Raich Carter Trophy&#x27; in honour of the late Raich Carter, who played for both of the clubs during his playing career, eventually also managing Hull between 1948 and 1951.

Twenty years later, almost to the day, on 17 December 2022, the clubs met again at the now MKM Stadium in the EFL Championship. Both sides agreed to recontest the Raich Carter Trophy to mark two decades at the Tigers&#x27; new stadium. The game ended 1–1 with Hull retaining the trophy, in front of a crowd of 18,120 spectators.

==Structure and facilities==
The all-seater stadium consists of a single-tier, asymmetrical bowl that can seat approximately 20,000, with a second tier on the West Stand that can seat approximately 5,000. The stadium&#x27;s current capacity is 25,586. Plans have previously been prepared for the potential extension of the stadium following Hull City&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League. A further 4,500 seats could be added to create a second tier to the East Stand, whilst there is also a possibility of adding extensions to both the North Stand and the South Stand of around 2,000 seats each. This would make the stadium a completed two-tier bowl with an overall capacity of approximately 34,000 seats.
Each stand has a name for corporate sponsorship purposes. On 4 July 2011, Hull City revealed that the stadium&#x27;s West Stand would be sponsored by the local Cranswick plc under a two-year agreement, which was extended on 26 July 2013.
On 10 July 2013 it was announced the East Stand would be sponsored by Ideal Standard and become known as the Ideal Standard Community East Stand. Ahead of the home fixture against West Bromwich Albion on 5 March 2022, the stand was renamed the Chris Chilton Stand, in honour of Hull City&#x27;s all-time record goalscorer, Chris Chilton.

Corporate hospitality is provided by 28 executive boxes located between the two tiers of the Cranswick plc West Stand, while security of the stadium is handled using 57 closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras that cover the stadium. Over the summer of 2007, SMC installed an LED screen in the Smith &amp; Nephew North Stand to replace the old electronic scoreboard. The screen has an area of approximately 40 m2 (430 ft.2) and displays such content as live home game feeds, match highlights, interviews, and action replays.

The stadium&#x27;s seats are mostly black, with a band of white and amber seats around the circumference. White and amber seats form the word &quot;Hull&quot; in both the North Stand and the South Stand. In the Ideal Standard Community East Stand, the seats form an image of a coronet, a symbol of the city that also appears in the club crest for Hull F.C. and in the coat of arms of the city council. Black, white, and amber were chosen to remain neutral toward the colours of its two tenants: black and white for Hull F.C. and black and amber for Hull City A.F.C. The blue and gold of owner Hull City Council appear in the stadium&#x27;s four external columns.

The size of the playing surface is 114 x 74 metres (125 x 81 yd) and made of rye grass with a 3% additive of artificial grass. This provides ample room for a FIFA-regulation association football pitch of 105 x 68 metres (115 x 74 yd) and a standard rugby league football pitch of 100 x 68 metres (109 x 74 yd) plus the minimum 6 metre (6.56 yd) long in-goals at each end. The playing surface has an automated watering system and below-surface heating.

Set within Hull&#x27;s West Park, the stadium is the first in England to be built in a parkland setting. The stadium complex also includes the 1,500 capacity Bonus Arena, a skate park, two multi-use all-weather pitches, a community learning zone complete with classrooms, a health &amp; fitness suite, a cyber cafe, and a library.

The stadium has received several honours. It was named the chief new development in Yorkshire at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Pro-Yorkshire Awards. It was also on the shortlist for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Better Public Building and received a high commendation in the British Construction Industry Awards in the Best Value category. In a 2005 poll that was carried out by Drivers Jonas and decided by football fans from across the country, the KC Stadium was rated highest in comfort, services and view among all grounds in the Football League and was also rated the most-improved venue.

In 2011, the then-Hull City owner Assem Allam announced that he wanted to buy the stadium freehold so he could develop, as he stated, &quot;a sports park&quot; on the site. After Hull City Council refused, Allam stated &quot;I had in mind £30 million to spend on the infrastructure of the club, to increase the stadium by 10,000 and to have commercial activities around the stadium – cafeterias, shops, supermarkets – to have all this to create income for the club so that in the future it can be self-financing and not relying on me.&quot;

On 13 August 2013 a Goal Decision System by Hawk-Eye was installed in the ground ahead of the 2013–14 Premier League season which requires the use of goal-line technology to indicate if a goal is scored.

On 25 June 2021, it was announced that local firm MKM Building Supplies had agreed a five-year sponsorship deal for the stadium&#x27;s naming rights, leading to the new name of the MKM Stadium.

In February 2023, Tan Kesler, Hull City&#x27;s vice chairman, announced that the club were exploring the plans that had been made during the stadium&#x27;s construction to upgrade the area surrounding the ground. These plans included &quot;community pitches&quot; and &quot;multi-dimensional sports facilities&quot;, similar to those seen at the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester, albeit on a smaller scale. Kesler stated that the club would work closely with the local council to ensure that the Hull Fair would not be impacted by any upgrades, as it occupies an area of land that could be used for potential development. However, in September 2024, the fair&#x27;s organisers deemed the early plans to upgrade the area as &quot;unacceptable&quot; and that they were even willing to begin a boycott in retaliation, if action was not taken to change the plans.

==Tenants==

===Hull City===

Hull City moved into the stadium upon its opening and it soon became the backdrop for the club&#x27;s rapid climb through the Football League. It first hosted the Tigers&#x27; home games during the second half of the 2002–03 season, with the first competitive match against Hartlepool United, a game that City won 2–0. The Tigers attracted an average attendance of almost 17,000 in their first full season at the then-KC Stadium, the 2003–04 season. This figure was more than three times the average attendance for Third Division sides that season, and was only matched or exceeded by clubs in the Premier League and the First Division. The stadium hosted Premier League football for the first time in the 2008–09 season, with all 20,500 available season tickets selling out shortly after Hull City&#x27;s play-off victory at Wembley Stadium.

Attendances for Hull City&#x27;s league games at the stadium have averaged above 16,000 in each full season they have played there, apart from a five year period between 2017 and 2022, where a mixture of protests against Assem Allam&#x27;s ownership of the club and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced crowds significantly. The club has seen an upturn in home attendances since the sale of the club to Acun Ilıcalı, with an average of 17,973 supporters attending City games during the first full-season with Ilıcalı as owner, the 2022–23 campaign. The following year, the 2023–24 season, the average home attendance grew yet further to 21,980.

Allocated segregation between home and away fans prevents the stadium&#x27;s full-stated capacity from ever being reached. As a result, the record attendance set at the MKM Stadium is 25,030, which was recorded on 9 May 2010 for City&#x27;s last match of the 2009–10 season against Liverpool, which ended 0–0. This marginally beat the previous record of 25,023, set just under two months earlier on 13 March 2010 in the 2–1 defeat to Arsenal. While playing in the Championship, the record stands at 24,605, set on 9 March 2024 when Leicester City drew 2–2 with the Tigers.

===Hull F.C.===

Hull F.C. moved into the stadium two months after the football club did, ahead of the 2003 Super League season. On 9 February 2003, they played their first match at the then-KC Stadium, a 24–16 fourth round Challenge Cup victory over Halifax in front of 15,310 spectators. In the Black and Whites&#x27; first four seasons after they left the Boulevard, they maintained good results. In 2003, the team narrowly missed out on the play-offs, before a third-placed finish in 2004 and a fourth-placed finish in 2005. However in the latter year they won the Challenge Cup, beating Leeds Rhinos 25–24 in a thrilling final. They came agonisingly close to victory again the following season, reaching the Super League Grand Final but ultimately losing 26–4 to St Helens. Aside from back-to-back Challenge Cup wins in 2016 and 2017, more recent years have been much less successful for the Black and Whites, only managing to reach the league play-offs three times since 2014, winning on none of those occasions.

The average attendance of rugby league games at the MKM Stadium are often significantly lower than the football games played there. This is largely explained by the fact that Kingston upon Hull as a city is home to two separate professional rugby league sides, the other being Hull Kingston Rovers. Therefore, half of the city&#x27;s rugby league fanbase does not follow the Black and Whites, unlike in the football where there is only one professional side. However, the stadium does in turn see a rise in attendance when the Hull derby is contested. It is therefore unsurprising that the highest attendance for a Hull F.C. game at the MKM Stadium was on 2 September 2007, when Hull K.R. thrashed the home side 42–6 in front of 23,004 spectators.

In April 2024, Hull F.C. chairman Adam Pearson discussed the possibility of the club leaving the MKM Stadium, as attendances for the Black and Whites&#x27; games have generally averaged far below full capacity since arriving. Pearson admitted that although he would be happy to explore the proposed idea of having a smaller stadium that was owned by the club, it was simply a &quot;pipe dream&quot; and not a currently viable option. He noted that if it were to happen, the new ground could be built similarly to both the Halliwell Jones Stadium and the York Community Stadium, at a suitable site in Hull like the Costello Stadium.

The MKM Stadium has previously hosted five England U-21 matches, four of which came relatively soon after the stadium&#x27;s opening. Most recently, the Young Lions played Kosovo U-21 in front of a crowd of 15,225 spectators in 2019.

In 2009, the then-KC Stadium was shortlisted as a possible venue for games at the 2018 FIFA World Cup should England win the right to host it. However, when the finalised list of venues was announced on 16 December 2009, the stadium was not among those included in the bid.

===Rugby league===
The MKM Stadium has previously hosted several rugby league matches at international level. These include one match at the 2013 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup, two at the 2021 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup and one at the 2021 Women&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup.
The MKM Stadium has become an occasional host venue for international rugby league games, including Great Britain matches in both the Tri-Nations and the Ashes competitions. The stadium hosted the 2004 Tri-Nations match in which New Zealand lost by a score of 26–24. The stadium also hosted the Tri-Nations game between Great Britain and Australia in 2005; the final score was 26–14 to Australia.

On 9 November 2013, the stadium hosted its only game of the 2013 Men&#x27;s Rugby League World Cup. Hosts England beat Fiji 34–12 in front of a crowd of 25,114. Before the match, there was a minute&#x27;s silence, followed by a spontaneous applause, to mark the sudden death of former Hull F.C. and England player Steve Prescott who had died earlier that day.

Due to the unavailability of its usual venue of Old Trafford, the stadium also hosted the 2020 Super League Grand Final.

==Concerts==
As well as serving as a sporting venue, the MKM Stadium also hosts musical events, including such artists as Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams, Neil Diamond, R.E.M., Bon Jovi, and The Who.

JLS have also performed here in front of 20,000 fans as part of their 2010 JLS Tour.

Rod Stewart performed at the stadium on 14 June 2016 and Jeff Lynne&#x27;s ELO played at the stadium on 1 July 2017.

<text>Rod cells are photoreceptor cells in the retina of the eye that can function in lower light better than the other type of visual photoreceptor, cone cells. Rods are usually found concentrated at the outer edges of the retina and are used in peripheral vision. On average, there are approximately 92 million rod cells (vs ~6 million cones) in the human retina. Rod cells are more sensitive than cone cells and are almost entirely responsible for night vision. However, rods have little role in color vision, which is the main reason why colors are much less apparent in dim light.

==Structure==
Rods are a little longer and leaner than cones but have the same basic structure. Opsin-containing disks lie at the end of the cell adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium, which in turn is attached to the inside of the eye. The stacked-disc structure of the detector portion of the cell allows for very high efficiency. Rods are much more common than cones, with about 120 million rod cells compared to 6 to 7 million cone cells.

Like cones, rod cells have a synaptic terminal, an inner segment, and an outer segment. The synaptic terminal forms a synapse with another neuron, usually a bipolar cell or a horizontal cell. The inner and outer segments are connected by a cilium, which lines the distal segment. The inner segment contains organelles and the cell&#x27;s nucleus, while the rod outer segment (abbreviated to ROS), which is pointed toward the back of the eye, contains the light-absorbing materials.

A human rod cell is about 2 microns in diameter and 100 microns long. Rods are not all morphologically the same; in mice, rods close to the outer plexiform synaptic layer display a reduced length due to a shortened synaptic terminal.

==Function==

===Photoreception===
In vertebrates, activation of a photoreceptor cell is a hyperpolarization (inhibition) of the cell. When they are not being stimulated, such as in the dark, rod cells and cone cells depolarize and release a neurotransmitter spontaneously. This neurotransmitter hyperpolarizes the bipolar cell. Bipolar cells exist between photoreceptors and ganglion cells and act to transmit signals from the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells. As a result of the bipolar cell being hyperpolarized, it does not release its transmitter at the bipolar-ganglion synapse and the synapse is not excited.

Activation of photopigments by light sends a signal by hyperpolarizing the rod cell, leading to the rod cell not sending its neurotransmitter, which leads to the bipolar cell then releasing its transmitter at the bipolar-ganglion synapse and exciting the synapse.

Depolarization of rod cells (causing release of their neurotransmitter) occurs because in the dark, cells have a relatively high concentration of cyclic guanosine 3&#x27;-5&#x27; monophosphate (cGMP), which opens ion channels (largely sodium channels, though calcium can enter through these channels as well). The positive charges of the ions that enter the cell down its electrochemical gradient change the cell&#x27;s membrane potential, cause depolarization, and lead to the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Glutamate can depolarize some neurons and hyperpolarize others, allowing photoreceptors to interact in an antagonistic manner.

When light hits photoreceptive pigments within the photoreceptor cell, the pigment changes shape. The pigment, called rhodopsin (conopsin is found in cone cells) comprises a large protein called opsin (situated in the plasma membrane), attached to which is a covalently bound prosthetic group: an organic molecule called retinal (a derivative of vitamin A). The retinal exists in the 11-cis-retinal form when in the dark, and stimulation by light causes its structure to change to all-trans-retinal. This structural change causes an increased affinity for the regulatory protein called transducin (a type of G protein). Upon binding to rhodopsin, the alpha subunit of the G protein replaces a molecule of GDP with a molecule of GTP and becomes activated. This replacement causes the alpha subunit of the G protein to dissociate from the beta and gamma subunits of the G protein. As a result, the alpha subunit is now free to bind to the cGMP phosphodiesterase (an effector protein). The alpha subunit interacts with the inhibitory PDE gamma subunits and prevents them from blocking catalytic sites on the alpha and beta subunits of PDE, leading to the activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase, which hydrolyzes cGMP (the second messenger), breaking it down into 5&#x27;-GMP. Reduction in cGMP allows the ion channels to close, preventing the influx of positive ions, hyperpolarizing the cell, and stopping the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Though cone cells primarily use the neurotransmitter substance acetylcholine, rod cells use a variety. The entire process by which light initiates a sensory response is called visual phototransduction.

Activation of a single unit of rhodopsin, the photosensitive pigment in rods, can lead to a large reaction in the cell because the signal is amplified. Once activated, rhodopsin can activate hundreds of transducin molecules, each of which in turn activates a phosphodiesterase molecule, which can break down over a thousand cGMP molecules per second. Thus, rods can have a large response to a small amount of light.

As the retinal component of rhodopsin is derived from vitamin A, a deficiency of vitamin A causes a deficit in the pigment needed by rod cells. Consequently, fewer rod cells are able to sufficiently respond in darker conditions, and as the cone cells are poorly adapted for sight in the dark, night-blindness can result.

===Reversion to the resting state===
Rods make use of three inhibitory mechanisms (negative feedback mechanisms) to allow a rapid revert to the resting state after a flash of light.

Firstly, there exists a rhodopsin kinase (RK) which would phosphorylate the cytosolic tail of the activated rhodopsin on the multiple serines, partially inhibiting the activation of transducin. Also, an inhibitory protein, arrestin, then binds to the phosphorylated rhodopsins to further inhibit the rhodopsin activity.

While arrestin shuts off rhodopsin, an RGS protein (functioning as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP)) drives the transducin (G-protein) into an &quot;off&quot; state by increasing the rate of hydrolysis of the bonded GTP to GDP.

When the cGMP concentration falls, the previously open cGMP sensitive channels close, leading to a reduction in the influx of calcium ions. The associated decrease in the concentration of calcium ions stimulates the calcium ion-sensitive proteins, which then activate the guanylyl cyclase to replenish the cGMP, rapidly restoring it to its original concentration. This opens the cGMP sensitive channels and causes a depolarization of the plasma membrane.

===Desensitization===
When the rods are exposed to a high concentration of photons for a prolonged period, they become desensitized (adapted) to the environment.

As rhodopsin is phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase (a member of the GPCR kinases (GRKs) ), it binds with high affinity to the arrestin. The bound arrestin can contribute to the desensitization process in at least two ways. First, it prevents the interaction between the G protein and the activated receptor. Second, it serves as an adaptor protein to aid the receptor to the clathrin-dependent endocytosis machinery (to induce receptor-mediated endocytosis).

===Sensitivity===
A rod cell is sensitive enough to respond to a single photon of light and is about 100 times more sensitive to a single photon than cones. Since rods require less light to function than cones, they are the primary source of visual information at night (scotopic vision). Cone cells, on the other hand, require tens to hundreds of photons to become activated. Additionally, multiple rod cells converge on a single interneuron, collecting and amplifying the signals. However, this convergence comes at a cost to visual acuity (or image resolution) because the pooled information from multiple cells is less distinct than it would be if the visual system received information from each rod cell individually.
Rod cells also respond more slowly to light than cones and the stimuli they receive are added over roughly 100 milliseconds. While this makes rods more sensitive to smaller amounts of light, it also means that their ability to sense temporal changes, such as quickly changing images, is less accurate than that of cones.

Experiments by George Wald and others showed that rods are most sensitive to wavelengths of light around 498 nm (green-blue), and insensitive to wavelengths longer than about 640 nm (red). This is responsible for the Purkinje effect: as intensity dims at twilight, the rods take over, and before color disappears completely, peak sensitivity of vision shifts towards the rods&#x27; peak sensitivity (blue-green).

<text>Ibrox Stadium is a football stadium on the south side of the River Clyde in the Ibrox area of Glasgow, Scotland. The home of Scottish Premiership team Rangers, Ibrox is the third-largest football stadium in Scotland, with an all-seated capacity of 51,700. The stadium was designed by renowned football stadium architect Archibald Leitch, with renovations to the stadium between 1978 and 1981, as well as 1990 and 1991, being designed by The Miller Partnership and Gareth Hutchison respectively.

Opened as Ibrox Park in 1899, it suffered a disaster in 1902 when a wooden terrace collapsed. Vast earthen terraces were built in its place, and a main stand, now a listed building, in 1928. A British record crowd of 118,567 gathered in January 1939 for a league match with Celtic. After another disaster in 1971, the stadium was largely rebuilt. The vast bowl-shaped terracing was removed and replaced by three rectangular, all-seated stands by 1981. After renovations were completed in 1997, the ground was renamed Ibrox Stadium.

A UEFA category four stadium, Ibrox hosted the Scotland national team when Hampden Park was redeveloped in the 1990s, and three Scottish cup finals in the same period, and has also been a concert venue. The stadium hosted the Rugby Sevens at the 2014 Commonwealth Games held in Scotland.

==History==
===First Ibrox (1872–1902)===
Rangers played its first match in May 1872, on Glasgow Green. The club then played home matches on public pitches across Glasgow, first moving to a regular home ground at Burnbank in 1875. A year later, Rangers played at the Clydesdale cricket ground in Kinning Park. This ground was improved to give a capacity of 7,000, but it was not owned by Rangers. After hints by the landlords that they wished to develop the site, Rangers left in February 1887. The club shared Cathkin Park with Third Lanark for the remainder of the 1886–87 season.

Rangers first moved to the Ibrox area later in 1887, playing on a site immediately to the east of the current stadium. The first match at this stadium was an 8–1 defeat to English side Preston North End on 20 August 1887, watched by a capacity crowd of over 15,000. This inaugural match had to be abandoned after 70 minutes due to a pitch invasion. The first Ibrox Park was a success in the short term, as three Scotland international matches and the 1890 Scottish Cup Final were played at the ground. Celtic Park, built in 1892, was more advanced, however. Rangers opted to construct a new stadium, raising funds by forming a limited company. The last match at the old ground was played on 9 December 1899. The new Ibrox Park was formally opened with a 3–1 victory over Hearts on 30 December.

===Ibrox Park and Ibrox disaster (1902–1928)===
Ibrox Park, as it was known between 1899 and 1997, is almost completely different from the Ibrox Stadium of today. It followed the model of most Scottish stadiums of the time, comprising an oval track around the pitch, with a pavilion and one stand along one side. The ground had a capacity of 40,000. Celtic Park, Ibrox and Hampden Park all competed with each other to host Scottish Cup Finals and Scotland matches, one of which could generate up to £1,000 in revenue for the host club. To aid their chances of gaining that revenue, Rangers constructed a large terracing, holding 36,000 people, behind the western goalmouth. The terracing, designed by Archibald Leitch, was formed by wooden planks bolted onto a framework made of iron. A similar wooden terracing was constructed at the eastern end, giving a total capacity of 75,000.

The structure was passed by the Govan Burgh Surveyor in March 1902, but there were newspaper reports that it was unstable. A crowd of 68,114 assembled for a Scotland v England match on 5 April 1902, but shortly after the kick-off one section of the terracing &quot;collapsed like a trap door&quot;. A gap of 20 square yards appeared, causing about 125 people to fall to the ground 50 feet below the terracing. Most survived due to the fact they fell on top of other bodies, but 25 people were killed. 517 people were injured, some due to being crushed in the panic caused by the collapse.

Most people in the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox disaster had happened. People even re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly because there was no public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and the supplier was tried for culpable homicide, but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.

===Renovations (1928–1953)===
The next major redevelopment occurred in 1928, after Rangers had won their first double. A new Main Stand, to the south side of the ground, was opened on 1 January 1929. The Main Stand, which has the familiar Leitch style criss-cross balcony and a red-brick facade, seated 10,000 people and provided standing accommodation in an enclosure. Simon Inglis, a writer on football stadia, commented in 2005 that the Main Stand is Leitch&#x27;s &quot;greatest work&quot; and is &quot;still resplendent today in its red brick glory under a modern mantle of glass and steel&quot;. The architectural significance of the Main Stand was reflected when it became a Category B listed building in 1987. Original seats in the Main Stand were made of cast iron and oak. One was auctioned in 2011 for £1,080.

The banking of the terracing continued to increase in the 1930s. On 2 January 1939, the Old Firm game against Celtic attracted a crowd of 118,567, the record attendance for any league match played in Britain. At this point, Ibrox was the second-largest stadium in Britain.

===Post-war, re-design and new name (1953–1997)===
Floodlights were first used at Ibrox in December 1953, for a friendly match against Arsenal. The first floodlit Scottish league match was played at Ibrox, in March 1956. Covers were built over the north and east terracing during the 1960s. No structural changes were made to Ibrox, but capacity was cut to approximately 80,000 by safety legislation.

Ibrox Park had the worst fan safety record in Britain before its complete redesign and renaming in 1997. Two fans died in September 1961 when a barrier collapsed on Stairway 13, resulting in a crush. Stairway 13 was a popular exit from the East Terracing due to its proximity to Copland Road subway station and parking areas for the Rangers supporters&#x27; coaches, but it was often overcrowded and very steep. After this incident, Rangers installed safety measures, but further injuries were sustained in crushes on Stairway 13 in both 1967 and 1969. On 23 October 1968, the main stand at Ibrox was hit by fire. Just seven months later there was another fire, which destroyed more than 200 seats behind the directors box. The worst disaster to date to affect football in Britain happened after the Old Firm game on 2 January 1971, when 66 people died of asphyxiation due to another crush on Stairway 13. The game itself ended in a 1–1 draw, with Colin Stein scoring a late equalising goal for Rangers. This led to a widespread belief that the crush had been caused by fans who had left the game early, but had turned back when they heard the roar that greeted the Rangers goal. A public inquiry discounted this initial story. It established that the crowd had been travelling in the same direction when the crush happened, with it perhaps being precipitated by some bending over to pick up items that had been discarded during the goal celebrations. The downward force of the crowd leaving the stadium meant that when people started to fall there was no means of preventing a crush.

The inquiry and subsequent compensation cases found that Rangers had been inept in their administration and complacent after the incidents in the 1960s. The disaster also highlighted, however, the fact that there were no established safety standards that should be adhered to, let alone any means of enforcing such standards. This had been first recommended nearly 50 years earlier, after the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1973, and legislation was enacted with the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. This law cut the capacity of Ibrox to 65,000. In the short term, Rangers took the stopgap measure of installing benches in the North Stand, which was renamed the Centenary Stand.

===Ibrox Stadium (1997–present)===

The 1971 Ibrox disaster led to the club developing a modern, safe stadium. Willie Waddell visited modern grounds in West Germany during the 1974 World Cup and believed that steep terracing and exits, such as Stairway 13, had to be replaced. The cut in capacity and boardroom changes led to radical plans by architects Miller Partnership, which were published in November 1977. The plans were modelled on the Westfalenstadion, home ground of Borussia Dortmund. They involved a radical reshaping of the stadium, with the old bowl-shaped terracing to be replaced by three new all-seated structures. Only the old Main Stand would remain, with its enclosure providing the only standing room in the ground.

Although later events, such as the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent Taylor Report, vindicated this plan, Rangers were taking a significant risk. The whole plan was estimated to cost £6 million, which no other club could have afforded in a short period of time. The development was funded by the Rangers football pools operation, which was the largest club-based scheme in Britain. The first phase of the plan, which began in 1978, was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand. The same process was repeated on the west side of the ground a year later, with the two identical stands each holding 7,500 seats. The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10,300 capacity Govan Stand.

The new Ibrox had a capacity of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the development cost had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a difficult period in the history of Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general, but also because of Rangers&#x27; generally poor performance at the time - between 1979 and 1986, Rangers never finished higher than 3rd. Despite this, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.

This all changed when a new regime, chaired by David Holmes, took control of Rangers in 1986. Graeme Souness was appointed player–manager, while several English stars, including Terry Butcher and Chris Woods, were signed. Season ticket sales rose from 7,000 in 1986 to over 30,000 in the 1990s, while commercial income increased from £239,000 in 1986 to over £2 million in 1989. The introduction of computerised ticketing, zonal public address systems and closed-circuit television for monitoring turnstile areas meant that Ibrox was at the forefront of stadium management. Rangers also adopted the American technique of analysing the types of fans in each area of the stadium and adjusted their food stalls accordingly. Greater success on the pitch meant that Ibrox demonstrated that seated stadiums would be welcomed by most fans, if designed and fitted well.

==Structure and facilities==
===Stadium design===
The Ibrox pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Bill Struth Main (south), Broomloan Road (west), Sandy Jardine (north) and Copland Road (east) Stands. Each stand has two tiers, with the exception of the Bill Struth Main Stand, which has had three tiers since the Club Deck was added in 1991. The two corner areas, known as the West and East areas of the Sandy Jardine Stand, have one tier of seating below a JumboTron screen.

The Bill Struth Main Stand, formerly known as the Main Stand, faces onto Edmiston Drive (A8 road). The red-brick facade, designed by Archibald Leitch, is a Category B listed building. Simon Inglis, writing in 1996, described it as an &quot;imposing red-brick facade, with its mock neo-classical arched, square and pedimented windows, exudes prestige and power.&quot; On each end wall the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic. Stairtowers leading to the Club Deck (third tier) stand at each end of the Main Stand. These towers are also framed in red-brick, but deliberately contrast with the main body of the stand. The two stairtowers also support a long and truss, claimed to be the longest and heaviest clear span girder in the world.

Through the main doors of the Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A marble staircase leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power with a sense of tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. The front wall of the middle tier is one of the last surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.

Opposite the Bill Struth Main Stand is the Sandy Jardine Stand formerly known as the Govan Stand. It is a two-tier stand, similar in style to the two end stands, which was completed in 1981. To the rear of the Govan Stand is the Argyle House extension, completed in 1990, which provides executive boxes, hospitality areas and office space. The Bar 72 area was added to the rear section of the Govan Stand in 2006. The Copland Road Stand, at the east end of the stadium, was completed in 1979 and now accommodates just over 8,000 fans. It is traditionally the &#x27;Rangers end&#x27; of the ground and the team normally chooses to attack that end in the second half of matches. The western Broomloan Road Stand, which was completed in 1980, is identical to the opposite end. Although constructed as separate structures, the three stands have been linked since the mid-1990s, when two additional areas of seating were added to the corner areas. All of the stands are designed using the &#x27;goalpost&#x27; structure, in which a large portal frame supports perpendicular beams on which roof cladding is secured. &quot;The Rangers Store&quot; is located in the corner between the Copland Road and Govan Stands.

Away fans are normally accommodated in the corner of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors. Celtic fans were normally given the whole of the Broomloan Stand for Old Firm derbies until 2018, when Rangers opted to restrict their allocation to the much smaller corner section.
===Club Deck===

David Murray acquired control of Rangers in November 1988. Argyle House, a £4 million extension behind the Govan Stand, was opened in 1990. This added executive boxes, office space and hospitality suites. A further series of developments was started in the early 1990s to increase capacity to over 50,000. Murray commissioned architect Gareth Hutchison to find a way of adding a third tier to the Main Stand. This was a highly complex process, as the Main Stand facade had become a listed building and Murray wanted the existing structure to remain open during construction. The contractors removed the original roof and added a temporary cover while the work carried on above. The Club Deck, which cost approximately £20 million, was opened with a league match against Dundee United in December 1991. The redevelopment of the Main Stand was partially financed by a Football Trust grant of £2 million and a debenture issue that raised £8.5 million. Ordinary fans bought debentures for between £1,000 and £1,650 each, which guaranteed the right to buy season tickets for at least 30 years, along with some other minor benefits.

Four columns were built through the existing Main Stand to support the Club Deck, which resulted in approximately 1,000 seats having a restricted view. After opening the Club Deck, Ibrox had a capacity of 44,500. When a new playing surface was installed in 1992, Rangers were able to add a further 1,300 seats to the front of three stands by lowering the pitch slightly. The only standing area of the ground, the enclosure of the Main Stand, was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations. The multi-coloured seats were replaced in 1995 with uniform blue seats. A further 1,200 seats were added in this process by reconfiguring passageways, giving a total capacity of 47,998.

The two spaces between the Govan, Copland and Broomloan Stands were filled in with seats and Jumbotron screens. The ground was officially renamed Ibrox Stadium after renovations were completed in 1997, when Ibrox had a capacity of just over 50,000.

===Capacity and developments===

Rangers have explored options to increase capacity at Ibrox. A report in the &quot;Daily Record&quot; in April 2007 claimed that Rangers were planning to increase capacity to 57,000, principally by removing the JumboTron screens and lowering the pitch to accommodate more seating. These plans were said to be dependent for finance upon improved performance by the team. In January 2008, Rangers announced that they were investigating three options to further develop Ibrox. One of the proposals would have resulted in a capacity of 70,000, by replacing three of the stands with a bowl-type structure. These plans were delayed in October 2008 due to the Great Recession.

Alongside changes to the stadium itself, Rangers have also sought to develop land around Ibrox. In partnership with the Las Vegas Sands corporation, the club received outline planning permission from Glasgow City Council for the development of land adjoining Ibrox as the home of a super casino. The casino was planned to be accompanied by a Rangers-themed leisure complex. Britain&#x27;s Casino Advisory Panel reviewed bids from eight short-listed cities, including Glasgow, and in 2007 awarded the first licence to Manchester. There is no immediate prospect of the Ibrox proposal being resurrected, as Gordon Brown dropped the plans for super casinos soon after becoming Prime Minister. Rangers were given approval by Glasgow City Council in October 2008 to purchase land around Ibrox and redevelop the area with hotel and retail outlets. This scheme stalled, however, as regulations constrained what could be built in the area.

Three rows of seating were added to the front of the Govan Stand upper tier in 2006, linked to a new &#x27;Bar 72&#x27; area, increasing the capacity to its present figure of . After opening the Bar 72 area in 2006, chief executive Martin Bain said that the scheme could be replicated in the Copland Stand. The Main Stand was renamed the Bill Struth Main Stand in September 2006, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death.

In January 2023, Rangers added 170 new seats in the Sandy Jardine Rear Stand by removing hospitality boxes in the former Argyle House Restaurant (rebranding it as the Blue Sky Lounge) adding three rows of seats to the rear of the stand and more disabled seating, taking the capacity up to 50,987.

In June 2023, a fan engagement meeting at New Edmiston House was told that Rangers were investigating various options to increase capacity. Beyond the previously announced plan to radically improve disabled facilities that would provide a net gain of 600 seats, Rangers costed both partial and complete infills of the corners between the Sandy Jardine stand and the Broomloan and Copland stands. The partial infills could deliver an increase of 1,300 seats per corner (2,600 total), with full infills delivering 3–4,000 seats per corner (6-8,000 total). In addition, there was an option to lower the playing surface to increase capacity by 4,500 seats, but this would involve the team having to relocate for matches until the work was completed.

In September 2024 the capacity of Ibrox Stadium increased to 51,700 with the addition of a further 600+ general access seats in the new Copland Rear cantilever and 30 disabled access seats being installed in the Copland Front.

===Sale of Ibrox Stadium, 2012===

Rangers became insolvent in February 2012 and was unable to reach a company voluntary arrangement with its creditors, principally HM Revenue and Customs. Ibrox Stadium, along with the business and other assets of Rangers, was sold in June 2012 to a new company run by Charles Green.

===Tributes and statues===

On 16 July 2014, the club paid a tribute to Sandy Jardine by renaming the Govan Stand in his honour. Jardine won the league championship three times and the Scottish Cup five times with Rangers.

On 25 May 2024, a statue of former manager Walter Smith was unveiled in front of Ibrox&#x27;s Copland Road Stand. Smith won ten league championships and five Scottish Cups with Rangers.

==Other uses==
===Football===
Ibrox has been a home venue for the Scotland national football team 18 times, the third most of any ground. The first Ibrox Park (1887–99) hosted three internationals, giving an overall Ibrox total of 21. The ground most recently hosted a Scotland game in October 2014 (a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifier against Georgia, won 1–0) when Hampden Park was unavailable due to its temporary conversion to hold athletics in the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Ibrox hosted several internationals during the 1990s, particularly during two phases of redevelopment works at Hampden. Ibrox hosted four Scotland games in the first phase, starting with a 1994 World Cup qualifier against Portugal in October 1992. It was not a happy interlude for Scotland fans, however, as the team failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1970. Although the attendances at Ibrox were higher than at Hampden, some fans resented the fact that they were helping the finances of Rangers. and there were complaints about high ticket prices. During the second phase of work at Hampden, Scotland won an important 1998 World Cup qualifier against Sweden at Ibrox.

During these periods of redevelopment to Hampden, Ibrox also hosted the 1997 Scottish Cup Final, and the 1994 and 1997 Scottish League Cup Finals. Ibrox was on the approved UEFA list to host major European finals in the 1990s, but it lost out in a bid to host the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final because a convention threatened a shortage of hotel rooms in Glasgow. Ibrox continued to hold the top UEFA rating, but the Scottish Football Association instead proposed Hampden as a venue for European finals during the 2000s.

===Non-football===
King George V &amp; Queen Mary visited Ibrox Park on 17 September 1917, to thank Glasgow and Clydeside for its efforts in the First World War. In the first ever public investiture in Scotland, and in front of 100,000, the King awarded medals to servicemen including three Victoria Crosses, 46 Military Medals and 33 Military Crosses. Four-fifths of the gathering were women - munitions workers, nurses and other war workers.
For the 1938 Empire Exhibition being held in Bellahouston Park and which attracted over 13 million visitors, his son King George VI suggested the official opening ceremony be held in Ibrox Park, allowing 146,000 spectators to see the opening. His speech was broadcast live to the nation and throughout the Empire on the morning of 3 May 1938. This was used as source material by Colin Firth for his performance in &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; movie.

Ibrox has been used for athletics competitions, Empire Games, and concerts, including performances by Simple Minds (1986), Frank Sinatra (1990), Rod Stewart (1995), Elton John (1998), Billy Joel (also 1998), Bon Jovi (1996, 2003 &amp; 2007) and Harry Styles (2022).

In 1980, Ibrox hosted a world championship boxing match between Jim Watt and Howard Davis. Ibrox hosted the rugby sevens event at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, won by South Africa. There was a total attendance of 171,000 for the four sessions of play, which set a new record for a rugby sevens tournament.

The stadium hosted the 1983 Centenary Celebrations of The Boys&#x27; Brigade.

==Transport==

The main railway stations in Glasgow, Central and Queen Street, are both approximately two miles from Ibrox. The Ibrox and Cessnock stations on the Glasgow Subway both serve Ibrox. It is also served by First Glasgow buses on Paisley Road West. Ibrox sits near to the M8 motorway, with junction 23 being the closest exit, but the roads around Ibrox become congested on matchdays. There was an Ibrox railway station, on the main line linking Glasgow and Paisley, which was closed in 1967 under the Beeching cuts.

<text>Freundeskreis (meaning &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;) also known as FK, were a German hip hop group from Stuttgart. They performed songs in German, English, French and Esperanto. The members were Max Herre, Don Philippe and DJ Friction.

They were a socially conscious German rap group that released three top twenty albums.

==History==

===Freundeskreis===
Freundeskreis were primarily known for their political lyrics, in which they advocate equality and international understanding. After the much-noticed first album, &quot;Quadratur des Kreises (Squaring the Circle)&quot;, and its hit single &quot;A-N-N-A&quot; which peaked at #6 in the German charts, the band released its second album, &quot;Esperanto&quot;, named after the constructed language Esperanto. The reasoning for the name was that the group wished to show that they believe that hip hop should be the Esperanto of youth.

In 1999 and 2000, the band was back in the charts with the singles &quot;Mit Dir&quot; (&quot;With you&quot;; featuring Joy Denalane, who later become Herre&#x27;s wife) and &quot;Tabula Rasa Pt. II&quot;. For the soundtrack of the film &quot;23&quot;, Freundeskreis covered the song &quot;Halt dich an deiner Liebe fest&quot; (&quot;Hold on to your love&quot;) written by Rio Reiser, voicing it on Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry&#x27;s police &amp; thieves riddim. Freundeskreis was one of the first bands to take part in the Kolchose, a group of hip hop artists from Stuttgart.

In 2001, the band took a break for the members to pursue solo careers, the most active being Herre, who has released a solo album and works as producer for his wife.

A Freundeskreis greatest hits album was released in July 2007 under the title &quot;FK10&quot;. After announcing their breakup in summer 2007, Freundeskreis gave their last concert in Stuttgart on 19 September 2007.

==Conscious lyrics==
Freundeskreis have been considered as a conscious hip-hop artist as their lyrics have educational themes. The song &quot;Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte&quot; (lay your ear on the tracks of history) asks listeners to look beyond what they were taught in history lessons and learn the real lessons of history.

Excerpts from &quot;Leg Dein Ohr Auf Die Schiene Der Geschichte&quot;&quot;

:&quot;viele Menschen schrecken zurück wenn sie &quot;Geschichte&quot; hör&#x27;n&quot;

:&quot;vier langweilige Stunden pro Woche in der Schule&quot;

:&quot;neunzehnhundertdreiundsiebzig Geburtsjahr wichtig für mich&quot;

:&quot;als auch geschichtlich denn da wurd&#x27; klar dass die C.I.A. &#x27;ne Hure war&quot;

Rough translation:

:&quot;many people step away when they hear &quot;history&quot;&quot;

:&quot;History...&quot;

:&quot;Four boring lessons in school a week &quot;

:&quot;nineteenseventythree, birth year, important for me,&quot;

:&quot;as well as historically, because then it became clear that the CIA was a whore&quot;

The rest of the song takes into account other historical events important to his year of birth, as well as other events throughout his childhood which are often overlooked. The chorus implores,

:&quot;you&#x27;re just a part of it so get to the heart of it&quot;

:&quot;&#x27;cause if you don&#x27;t go you won&#x27;t know&quot;

:&quot;you&#x27;re just a part of it get to the heart of it&quot;

:&quot;&#x27;cause if you don&#x27;t go you never ever never ever gonna know&quot;

<text>Norman Earl Thagard (born July 3, 1943; Capt, USMC, Ret.) is an American scientist and former U.S. Marine Corps officer and naval aviator and NASA astronaut. He is the first American to ride to space on board a Russian vehicle, and can be considered the first American cosmonaut. He did this on March 14, 1995, in the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft for the Russian Mir-18 mission.

==Experience==
Thagard held a number of research and teaching posts while completing the academic requirements for various earned degrees.

In September 1966 he entered active duty with the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He achieved the rank of captain in 1967, was designated a Naval Aviator in 1968 and was subsequently assigned to duty flying F-4 Phantom IIs with VMFA-333 at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina. He flew 163 combat missions in Vietnam while assigned to VMFA-115 from January 1969 to 1970. He returned to the United States and an assignment as aviation weapons division officer with VMFA-251 at the Marine Corps Air Station at Beaufort, South Carolina.

Thagard resumed his academic studies in 1971, pursuing additional studies in Electrical Engineering, and a degree in medicine. Before joining NASA, he was interning in the Department of Internal Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina. He is a licensed physician.

He is a pilot and has logged more than 2,200 hours flying time, of which the majority was in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==
Thagard was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in January 1978. In August 1979, he completed a one-year training and evaluation period, making him eligible for assignment as a mission specialist on future Space Shuttle flights. A veteran of five space flights, he logged over 140 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-7 in 1983, STS-51-B in 1985, STS-30 in 1989, was the payload commander on STS-42 in 1992, and was the cosmonaut/researcher on the Russian Mir EO-18 mission in 1995, which saw him launch aboard Soyuz TM-21 (the first American to launch in a Soyuz) and land on STS-71.

Thagard first flew on the crew of STS-7, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 18, 1983. This was the second flight for the Orbiter &quot;Challenger&quot; and the first mission with a crew of five. During the mission, the STS-7 crew deployed satellites for Canada (ANIK C-2) and Indonesia (Palapa B1); operated the Canadian-built Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to perform the first deployment and retrieval exercise with the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS-01); conducted the first formation flying of the Orbiter with a free-flying satellite (SPAS-01); carried and operated the first U.S./German cooperative materials science payload (OSTA-2); and operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System (CFES) and the Monodisperse Latex Reactor (MLR) experiments, in addition to activating seven &quot;Getaway Specials.&quot; During the flight, Thagard conducted various medical tests and collected data on physiological changes associated with astronaut adaptation to space. He also retrieved the rotating SPAS-01 using the RMS. Mission duration was 147 hours before landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1983.

Thagard then flew on STS-51-B, the Spacelab-3 science mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985, aboard &quot;Challenger&quot;. During the mission he served as flight engineer, sitting on the flight deck and assisting the commander and pilot during ascent and entry. Mission duration was 168 hours. Duties on orbit included satellite deployment operation with the NUSAT satellite as well as animal care for the 24 rats and two squirrel monkeys contained in the Research Animal Holding Facility (RAHF). Other duties were operation of the Geophysical Fluid Flow Cell (GFFC), Urinary Monitoring System (UMS) and the Ionization States of Solar and Galactic Cosmic Ray Heavy Nuclei (IONS) experiment. After 110 orbits of the Earth, &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985.

He next served on the crew of STS-30, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989, aboard the Orbiter &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Thagard again served as flight engineer. During this four-day mission, crew members deployed the &quot;Magellan&quot; Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. &quot;Magellan&quot; arrived at Venus in mid-1990 and mapped the entire surface of Venus using specialized radar instruments. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry and electrical storm studies. Mission duration was 97 hours. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989.

Thagard served as payload commander on STS-42, aboard the orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot;, which lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the STS-42 crew accomplished the mission&#x27;s primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, crew members worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992.

On his last mission, Thagard was a crew member for the Russian Mir EO-18 mission. Twenty-eight experiments were conducted in the course of the 115-day flight. The crew lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan aboard Soyuz TM-21 on March 14, 1995. The mission culminated in a landing at the Kennedy Space Center on the Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; flight STS-71 on July 7, 1995.

<doc id="514384" wikidata="Q1018644" url="?curid=514384" title="Byronic hero">
<text>The Byronic hero is a variant of the Romantic hero as a type of character, named after the English Romantic poet Lord Byron. Historian and critic Lord Macaulay described the character as &quot;a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his brow, and misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection&quot;.

Both Byron&#x27;s own persona as well as characters from his writings are considered to provide defining features to the character type.

The Byronic hero first reached a very wide public in Byron&#x27;s semi-autobiographical epic narrative poem &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot; (1812–1818). Despite Byron&#x27;s clarifying Childe was a fictitious character in the preface of the work, &quot;the public immediately associated Byron with his gloomy hero&quot;, with readers &quot;convinced ... that Byron and Childe were one and the same&quot;.

Byron&#x27;s poems with Oriental settings show more &quot;swashbuckling&quot; and decisive versions of the type. Later works show Byron progressively distancing himself from the figure by providing alternative hero types, like Sardanapalus (&quot;Sardanapalus&quot;), Juan (&quot;Don Juan&quot;) or Torquil (&quot;The Island&quot;), or, when the figure is present, by presenting him as less sympathetic (Alp in &quot;The Siege of Corinth&quot;) or criticising him through the narrator or other characters. Byron would later attempt such a turn in his own life when he joined the Greek War of Independence, with fatal results, though recent studies show him acting with greater political acumen and less idealism than previously thought. The actual circumstances of his death from disease in Greece were unglamorous in the extreme, but back in England these details were ignored in the many works promoting his myth.

== Origins ==
The initial version of the type in Byron&#x27;s work, Childe Harold, draws on a variety of earlier literary characters including Hamlet, Goethe&#x27;s Werther (1774), and William Godwin&#x27;s Mr. Faulkland in &quot;Caleb Williams&quot; (1794); he was also noticeably similar to René, the hero of Chateaubriand&#x27;s novella of 1802, although Byron may not have read this. Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;unrepentant&quot; Gothic villains (beginning in 1789 with the publication of &quot;The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne, a Highland Story&quot;) also foreshadow a moody, egotistical Byronic &quot;villain&quot; nascent in Byron&#x27;s own juvenilia, some of which looks back to Byron&#x27;s Gordon relations, Highland aristocrats or Jacobites now lost between two worlds. For example, in Byron&#x27;s early poem &quot;When I Roved a Young Highlander&quot; (1808), we see a reflection of Byron&#x27;s youthful Scottish connection, but also find these lines:

&lt;poem&gt;As the last of my race, I must wither alone,
And delight but in days, I have witness&#x27;d before:&lt;/poem&gt;

These lines echo William Wordsworth&#x27;s treatment of James Macpherson&#x27;s Ossian in &quot;Glen-Almain&quot; (1807):

&lt;poem&gt;That Ossian, last of all his race!
Lies buried in this lonely place.&lt;/poem&gt;

Thus Byron&#x27;s poem seems to show that a brooding, melancholy influence not only from Wordsworth but also from Macpherson was very much on his mind at an early date.

After &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, the Byronic hero made an appearance in many of Byron&#x27;s other works, including his series of poems on Oriental themes: &quot;The Giaour&quot; (1813), &quot;The Corsair&quot; (1814) and &quot;Lara&quot; (1814); and his closet play &quot;Manfred&quot; (1817). For example, Byron described Conrad, the pirate hero of his &quot;The Corsair&quot; (1814), as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;That man of loneliness and mystery,
Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh— (I, VIII)&lt;/poem&gt;
and&lt;poem&gt;He knew himself a villain—but he deem&#x27;d
The rest no better than the thing he seem&#x27;d;
And scorn&#x27;d the best as hypocrites who hid
Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
He knew himself detested, but he knew
The hearts that loath&#x27;d him, crouch&#x27;d and dreaded too.
Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt
From all affection and from all contempt: (I, XI)&lt;/poem&gt;

==Public reaction and following==
Admiration of Byron continued to be fervent in the years following his death, despite claims from author Peter L. Thorslev that the literary culture of the Byronic Hero &quot;died in England almost with Byron&quot;. Notable fans included Alfred Tennyson: fourteen at the time of Byron&#x27;s death, and so grieved at the poet&#x27;s passing, he carved the words &quot;Byron is dead&quot; on a rock near his home in Somersby, declaring the &quot;world had darkened for him&quot;. However, the admiration of Byron as a character led some fans to emulate characteristics of the Byronic hero. Foremost was Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, who took the Byron cult to remarkable extremes. His marriage to Byron&#x27;s granddaughter, taking a &quot;Byron pilgrimage&quot; around the Continent, and his anti-imperialist stance that saw him become an outcast just like his hero, cemented his commitment to emulating the Byronic character. For professor David Michael Jones, the Byronic Hero becomes an expression of masculinity that &quot;is changed, repressed, and reformatted through the long nineteenth century&quot;.

==Literary usage and other influences==

Byron&#x27;s influence is manifest in many authors and artists of the Romantic movement and writers of Gothic fiction during the 19th century. Lord Byron was the model for the title character of &quot;Glenarvon&quot; (1816) by Byron&#x27;s erstwhile lover Lady Caroline Lamb; and for Lord Ruthven in &quot;The Vampyre&quot; (1819) by Byron&#x27;s personal physician, John William Polidori. Edmond Dantes from Alexandre Dumas&#x27; &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; (1844), Heathcliff from Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847), and Rochester from Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847) are other later 19th-century examples of Byronic heroes.

In later Victorian literature, the Byronic character only seemed to survive as a solitary figure, resigned to suffering. However, Charles Dickens&#x27; representation of the character is more complex than that. Steerforth in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; manifests the concept of the &quot;fallen angel&quot; aspect of the Byronic hero; his violent temper and seduction of Emily should turn the reader, and indeed David, against him. But it does not. He still retains a fascination, as David admits in the aftermath of discovering what Steerforth has done to Emily. He may have done wrong, but David cannot bring himself to hate him. Steerforth&#x27;s occasional outbreaks of remorse reveal a tortured character, echoing a Byronic remorse. Harvey concludes that Steerforth is a remarkable blend of both villain and hero, and exploration of both sides of the Byronic character.

Scholars have also drawn parallels between the Byronic hero and the so-called superfluous man, solipsist heroes of Russian literature. In particular, Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s famous character Eugene Onegin echoes many of the attributes seen in &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, such as solitary brooding and disrespect for traditional privilege. The first stages of Pushkin&#x27;s poetic novel &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; appeared twelve years after Byron&#x27;s &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;, and Byron was of obvious influence (Vladimir Nabokov argued in his &quot;Commentary to Eugene Onegin&quot; that Pushkin had read Byron during his years in exile just prior to composing &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;). The same character themes continued to influence Russian literature, particularly after Mikhail Lermontov invigorated the Byronic hero through the character Pechorin in his 1839 novel &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot;.

The Byronic hero is also featured in many contemporary novels, and has played a role in modern literature as the precursor to a popular form of antihero. Erik, the Phantom from Gaston Leroux&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1909–1910) is a well-known example from the first half of the twentieth century, while Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond (if not his cinematic incarnations) shows all the earmarks in the second half: &quot;Lonely, melancholy, of fine natural physique, which has become in some way ravaged ... dark and brooding in expression, of a cold and cynical veneer, above all &quot;enigmatic,&quot; in possession of a sinister secret.&quot;

===Modernity===

Different iterations of the Byronic Hero are also recognisable in pop culture. Many researchers have already connected the figure of the Byronic Hero to mainstream Hollywood characters: Christopher Nolan&#x27;s interpretation of Bruce Wayne as superhero vigilante Batman has been described as embodying “the dark side of human possibilities”, where his “moral code does not align with the law.” Christian Bale&#x27;s portrayal of the character in the &quot;Dark Knight&quot; trilogy was described by Nolan as &quot;exactly the balance of darkness and light that we were looking for.&quot; The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise has also repeatedly dealt with themes of temptation and corruption relating to the central conflict between a &quot;Light Side&quot; and a &quot;Dark Side&quot;, as embodied by the character of Anakin Skywalker. The undisputed villain of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy achieves some sense of redemption when audiences get insight of the manipulation and mind control he became the victim of, which inevitably led him to become the infamous Darth Vader. This ambiguity and his close relationship with darkness (literal and figuratively) places him right in the centre of the Byronic Hero archetype. 

==Byronic heroine==
There are also suggestions of the potential of a Byronic heroine in Byron&#x27;s works. Charles J. Clancy argues that Aurora Raby in &quot;Don Juan&quot; possesses many of the characteristics typical of a Byronic hero. Described as &quot;silent, lone&quot; in the poem, her life has indeed been spent in isolation – she has been orphaned from birth. She validates Thorslev&#x27;s assertion that Byronic heroes are &quot;invariably solitaries&quot;. Yet, like her male counterpart, she evokes an interest from those around her, &quot;There was awe in the homage which she drew&quot;. Again, this is not dissimilar to the description of the fascination that Byron himself encountered wherever he went. Her apparent mournful nature is also reminiscent of the regretful mien of the Byronic hero. She is described as having deeply sad eyes, &quot;Eyes which sadly shone, as Seraphs&#x27; shine&quot;. This was a specific characteristic of the Byronic hero. This seems to express a despair with humanity, not unlike the despair present in Byron&#x27;s &quot;Cain&quot;, as Thorslev notes. She herself admits to despairing at &quot;man&#x27;s decline&quot;, therefore this brings her into direct comparison with Cain&#x27;s horror at the destruction of humanity.

<text>The Youth Action Network (formerly the National Federation of Youth Action Agencies) was a UK-wide youth organisation that promotes volunteering by young people in their communities.

The organisation was set up in 1989 under the name World Affairs Canada as a support network for Youth Action Agencies across the country, it later changed name to Youth Action Network in 1995. It was supported itself by the National Youth Agency, though this support ceased with the launch of Millennium Volunteers in 1999.

One of the chief successes of the organisation has been the development of a quality assurance model, based on PQASSO, for its members.

It merged into NCVYS on 9 March 2012 

Youth Action Network members include:
*Aylesbury Youth Action (founder member)
*Youth Action Cambridge (founder member)
*Solent Youth Action
*The Ivy Project

Youth Action Network currently has around 100 member organisations which pay an annual fee to be a member of the network.

May also stand for young adult novel, in certain circumstances, including and not limited to fanfictions. These fanfictions often refer to movies in the late 20th century.

<text>The Wisconsin State Assembly is the lower house of the Wisconsin Legislature. Together with the smaller Wisconsin Senate, the two constitute the legislative branch of the U.S. state of Wisconsin.

Members of the Assembly are elected to two-year terms during the fall elections. In the event of a vacancy in an Assembly seat between elections, a special election may be held to fill the position.

The Wisconsin Constitution limits the size of the State Assembly to between 54 and 100 members inclusive. Since 1973, the state has been divided into 99 Assembly districts apportioned amongst the state based on population as determined by the decennial census, for a total of 99 representatives. From 1848 to 1853 there were 66 assembly districts; from 1854 to 1856, 82 districts; from 1857 to 1861, 97 districts; and from 1862 to 1972, 100 districts. The size of the Wisconsin State Senate is tied to the size of the Assembly; it must be between one-fourth and one-third the size of the Assembly. Presently, the Senate has 33 members, with each Senate district formed by combining three neighboring Assembly districts.

The Assembly chamber is located in the west wing of the Wisconsin State Capitol building, in Madison, Wisconsin.

==History==
The United States first organized Wisconsin in 1787 under the Northwest Ordinance after Great Britain yielded the land to them in the Treaty of Paris. It became the Wisconsin Territory in 1836. The then-territorial assembly, after elections, was seated in Burlington for three sessions before they relocated to the permanent capital, Madison. 

During the period of territorial assembly, the assembled members helped to set up the court system, established the borders and number of counties, and regularized the spelling of Wisconsin. In 1842, an assemblyman (Charles Arndt, a Whig of Brown County) was shot dead by another assemblyman, James Vineyard, a Democrat of Grant County, over an appointment for Grant County sheriff. 

Wisconsin became a U.S. state on May 29, 1848, and special elections were held to fill the first session of the State Assembly; at the time, the body consisted of 66 members. The Assembly was expanded to 82 seats in 1852, and then to 97 seats in 1856, then to 100 seats in 1861, which is the maximum allowed in the Constitution of Wisconsin. The membership remained at 100 seats until the 1971 redistricting act, which decreased membership to 99 in order to comply with federal equal representation requirements within the limits of the Wisconsin Constitution. The current number of 99 seats is set in order to maintain a 3:1 ratio of Assembly to Senate seats.

In the 2010s, the Assembly was heavily gerrymandered, with a 53–45% Democratic majority in the popular vote in the 2018 election translating into a 63–36 Republican majority in the Assembly. According to the &quot;Oshkosh Northwestern&quot;, many experts recognized Wisconsin as the most gerrymandered state in the United States, a claim rated &quot;Mostly True&quot; by Politifact. After the Republican redistricting in 2021, the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism reported the efficiency gap had further increased to 16.6% in favor of Republicans.

On July 8, 2015, a case was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin arguing that Wisconsin&#x27;s 2011 state assembly map was unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering favoring the Republican-controlled legislature which discriminated against Democratic voters. This case became filed with the court as &quot;Whitford v Gill.&quot; The case made it to the United States Supreme Court, which vacated and remanded the case. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiff challenging the state assembly map did not have standing to sue. In the Opinion of the Court, Chief Justice John Roberts stated that &quot;[a] federal court is not &#x27;a forum for generalized grievances,&quot; and the requirement of such a personal stake &#x27;ensures that courts exercise power that is judicial in nature.&quot; &quot;Gill v. Whitford, 128 S.Ct. 1916 (2018).&quot; We enforce that requirement by insisting that a plaintiff [have] Article III standing...&quot; Justice Elena Kagan filed a concurring opinion, in which Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor joined. Justice Clarence Thomas filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgment, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch joined.
On December 22, 2023, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Clarke v. Wisconsin Elections Commission&quot; that the gerrymandered districts were unconstitutional and must be redrawn before the 2024 legislative elections.

==Salary and benefits==

Representatives elected or re-elected in the fall of 2016 receive an annual salary of $57,408.

In addition to their salaries, representatives are allowed to claim a per diem for travel expenses. The maximum rate is set by the 2001 Wisconsin Act 16 to 90% of the U.S. General Services Administration rate, but the houses are permitted to establish additional criteria for determining per diem. The State Assembly per diem is set to $155.70 per overnight stay and $77.85 for day visits. A maximum of 153 days may be claimed for per diem in 2023, and 80 days may be claimed in 2024. Over two years, each representative is allotted $12,000 to cover general office expenses, printing, postage and district mailings.

According to a 1960 study, at that time Assembly salaries and benefits were so low that in Milwaukee County, positions on the County Board of Supervisors and the Milwaukee Common Council were considered more desirable than seats in the Assembly, and an average of 23% of Milwaukee legislators did not seek re-election. This pattern was not seen to hold to the same extent in the rest of the state, where local offices tended to pay less well.

<doc id="514402" wikidata="Q192475" url="?curid=514402" title="IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry">
<text>In chemical nomenclature, the IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry is a method of naming organic chemical compounds as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). It is published in the &quot;Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry&quot; (informally called the Blue Book). Ideally, every possible organic compound should have a name from which an unambiguous structural formula can be created. There is also an IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry.

To avoid long and tedious names in normal communication, the official IUPAC naming recommendations are not always followed in practice, except when it is necessary to give an unambiguous and absolute definition to a compound. IUPAC names can sometimes be simpler than older names, as with ethanol, instead of ethyl alcohol. For relatively simple molecules they can be more easily understood than non-systematic names, which must be learnt or looked over. However, the common or trivial name is often substantially shorter and clearer, and so preferred. These non-systematic names are often derived from an original source of the compound. Also, very long names may be less clear than structural formulas.

==Basic principles==
In chemistry, a number of prefixes, suffixes and infixes are used to describe the type and position of the functional groups in the compound.

The steps for naming an organic compound are: 
# Identification of the most senior group. If more than one functional group, if any, is present, the one with highest group precedence should be used.
# Identification of the ring or chain with the maximum number of senior groups. 
# Identification of the ring or chain with the most senior elements (In order: N, P, Si, B, O, S, C).
# Identification of the parent compound. Rings are senior to chains if composed of the same elements.
## For cyclic systems: Identification of the parent cyclic ring. The cyclic system must obey these rules, in order of precedence:
### It should have the most senior heteroatom (in order: N, O, S, P, Si, B).
### It should have the maximum number of rings. 
### It should have the maximum number of atoms.
### It should have the maximum number of heteroatoms.
### It should have the maximum number of senior heteroatoms (in order: O, S, N, P, Si, B).
## For chains: Identification of the parent hydrocarbon chain. This chain must obey the following rules, in order of precedence:
### It should have the maximum length.
### It should have the maximum number of heteroatoms.
### It should have the maximum number of senior heteroatoms (in order: O, S, N, P, Si, B).
##For cyclic systems and chains after previous rules:
###It should have the maximum number of multiple, then double bonds. 
###It should have the maximum number of substituents of the suffix functional group. By suffix, it is meant that the parent functional group should have a suffix, unlike halogen substituents. If more than one functional group is present, the one with highest group precedence should be used.
# Identification of the side-chains. Side chains are the carbon chains that are not in the parent chain, but are branched off from it.
# Identification of the remaining functional groups, if any, and naming them by their ionic prefixes (such as hydroxy for , oxy for , oxyalkane for , etc.).Different side-chains and functional groups will be grouped together in alphabetical order. (The multiplier prefixes di-, tri-, etc. are not taken into consideration for grouping alphabetically. For example, ethyl comes before dihydroxy or dimethyl, as the &quot;e&quot; in &quot;ethyl&quot; precedes the &quot;h&quot; in &quot;dihydroxy&quot; and the &quot;m&quot; in &quot;dimethyl&quot; alphabetically. The &quot;di&quot; is not considered in either case). When both side chains and secondary functional groups are present, they should be written mixed together in one group rather than in two separate groups.
# Identification of double/triple bonds.
# Numbering of the chain. This is done by first numbering the chain in both directions (left to right and right to left), and then choosing the numbering which follows these rules, in order of precedence. Not every rule will apply to every compound, rules can be skipped if they do not apply. 
## Has the lowest-numbered locant (or locants) for heteroatoms. Locants are the numbers on the carbons to which the substituent is directly attached.
## Has the lowest-numbered locants for the indicated hydrogen. The indicated hydrogen is for some unsaturated heterocyclic compounds. It refers to the hydrogen atoms not attached to atoms with double bonds in the ring system. 
## Has the lowest-numbered locants for the suffix functional group. 
## Has the lowest-numbered locants for multiple bonds (&#x27;ene&#x27;, &#x27;yne&#x27;), and hydro prefixes. (The locant of a multiple bond is the number of the adjacent carbon with a lower number).
## Has the lowest-numbered locants for all substituents cited by prefixes.
## Has the lowest-numbered locants for substituents in order of citation (for example: in a cyclic ring with only bromine and chlorine functional groups, alphabetically bromo- is cited before chloro- and would receive the lower locant).
# Numbering of the various substituents and bonds with their locants. If there is more than one of the same type of substituent/double bond, a prefix is added showing how many there are (di – 2, tri – 3, tetra – 4, then as for the number of carbons below with &#x27;a&#x27; added at the end)

The numbers for that type of side chain will be grouped in ascending order and written before the name of the side-chain. If there are two side-chains with the same alpha carbon, the number will be written twice. Example: 2,2,3-trimethyl- . If there are both double bonds and triple bonds, &quot;en&quot; (double bond) is written before &quot;yne&quot; (triple bond). When the main functional group is a terminal functional group (a group which can exist only at the end of a chain, like formyl and carboxyl groups), there is no need to number it.

# Arrangement in this form: Group of side chains and secondary functional groups with numbers made in step 6 + prefix of parent hydrocarbon chain (eth, meth) + double/triple bonds with numbers (or &quot;ane&quot;) + primary functional group suffix with numbers.Wherever it says &quot;with numbers&quot;, it is understood that between the word and the numbers, the prefix (di-, tri-) is used.
# Adding of punctuation:
## Commas are put between numbers (2 5 5 becomes 2,5,5)
## Hyphens are put between a number and a letter (2 5 5 trimethylheptane becomes 2,5,5-trimethylheptane)
## Successive words are merged into one word (trimethyl heptane becomes trimethylheptane) Note: IUPAC uses one-word names throughout. This is why all parts are connected.

The resulting name appears as:
:#,#-di&lt;side chain&gt;-#-&lt;secondary functional group&gt;-#-&lt;side chain&gt;-#,#,#-tri&lt;secondary functional group&gt;&lt;parent chain prefix&gt;&lt;If all bonds are single bonds, use &quot;ane&quot;&gt;-#,#-di&lt;double bonds&gt;-#-&lt;triple bonds&gt;-#-&lt;primary functional group&gt;

where each &quot;#&quot; represents a number. The group secondary functional groups and side chains may not look the same as shown here, as the side chains and secondary functional groups are arranged alphabetically. The di- and tri- have been used just to show their usage. (di- after #,#, tri- after #,#,#, etc.)

=== Example ===
Here is a sample molecule with the parent carbons numbered:
For simplicity, here is an image of the same molecule, where the hydrogens in the parent chain are removed and the carbons are shown by their numbers:
Now, following the above steps:
# The parent hydrocarbon chain has 23 carbons. It is called tricosa-.
# The functional groups with the highest precedence are the two ketone groups.
## The groups are on carbon atoms 3 and 9. As there are two, we write 3,9-dione.
## The numbering of the molecule is based on the ketone groups. When numbering from left to right, the ketone groups are numbered 3 and 9. When numbering from right to left, the ketone groups are numbered 15 and 21. 3 is less than 15, therefore the ketones are numbered 3 and 9. The smaller number is always used, not the sum of the constituents numbers.
# The side chains are: an ethyl- at carbon 4, an ethyl- at carbon 8, and a butyl- at carbon 12. Note: the at carbon atom 15 is not a side chain, but it is a methoxy functional group.
#* There are two ethyl- groups. They are combined to create, 4,8-diethyl.
#* The side chains are grouped like this: 12-butyl-4,8-diethyl. (But this is not necessarily the final grouping, as functional groups may be added in between to ensure all groups are listed alphabetically.)
# The secondary functional groups are: a hydroxy- at carbon 5, a chloro- at carbon 11, a methoxy- at carbon 15, and a bromo- at carbon 18. Grouped with the side chains, this gives 18-bromo-12-butyl-11-chloro-4,8-diethyl-5-hydroxy-15-methoxy.
# There are two double bonds: one between carbons 6 and 7, and one between carbons 13 and 14. They would be called &quot;6,13-diene&quot;, but the presence of alkynes switches it to 6,13-dien. There is one triple bond between carbon atoms 19 and 20. It will be called 19-yne.
# The arrangement (with punctuation) is: 18-bromo-12-butyl-11-chloro-4,8-diethyl-5-hydroxy-15-methoxytricosa-6,13-dien-19-yne-3,9-dione
# Finally, due to cis-trans isomerism, we have to specify the relative orientation of functional groups around each double bond. For this example, both double bonds are trans isomers, so we have (6&quot;E&quot;,13&quot;E&quot;)

The final name is (6&quot;E&quot;,13&quot;E&quot;)-18-bromo-12-butyl-11-chloro-4,8-diethyl-5-hydroxy-15-methoxytricosa-6,13-dien-19-yne-3,9-dione.

==Hydrocarbons==

===Alkanes===
Straight-chain alkanes take the suffix &quot;-ane&quot; and are prefixed depending on the number of carbon atoms in the chain, following standard rules. The first few are:

For example, the simplest alkane is methane, and the nine-carbon alkane is named nonane. The names of the first four alkanes were derived from methanol, ether, propionic acid and butyric acid, respectively. The rest are named with a Greek numeric prefix, with the exceptions of nonane which has a Latin prefix, and undecane which has mixed-language prefixes.

Cyclic alkanes are simply prefixed with &quot;cyclo-&quot;: for example, is cyclobutane (not to be confused with butene) and is cyclohexane (not to be confused with hexene).
Branched alkanes are named as a straight-chain alkane with attached alkyl groups. They are prefixed with a number indicating the carbon the group is attached to, counting from the end of the alkane chain. For example, , commonly known as isobutane, is treated as a propane chain with a methyl group bonded to the middle (2) carbon, and given the systematic name 2-methylpropane. However, although the name 2-methylpropane &quot;could&quot; be used, it is easier and more logical to call it simply methylpropane – the methyl group could not possibly occur on any of the other carbon atoms (that would lengthen the chain and result in butane, not propane) and therefore the use of the number &quot;2&quot; is unnecessary.

If there is ambiguity in the position of the substituent, depending on which end of the alkane chain is counted as &quot;1&quot;, then numbering is chosen so that the smaller number is used. For example, (isopentane) is named 2-methylbutane, not 3-methylbutane.
If there are multiple side-branches of the same size alkyl group, their positions are separated by commas and the group prefixed with multiplier prefixes depending on the number of branches. For example, (neopentane) is named 2,2-dimethylpropane. If there are different groups, they are added in alphabetical order, separated by commas or hyphens. The longest possible main alkane chain is used; therefore 3-ethyl-4-methylhexane instead of 2,3-diethylpentane, even though these describe equivalent structures. The di-, tri- etc. prefixes are ignored for the purpose of alphabetical ordering of side chains (e.g. 3-ethyl-2,4-dimethylpentane, not 2,4-dimethyl-3-ethylpentane).

===Alkenes===


Alkenes are named for their parent alkane chain with the suffix &quot;-ene&quot; and a numerical root indicating the position of the carbon with the lower number for each double bond in the chain: is but-1-ene.
Multiple double bonds take the form -diene, -triene, etc., with the size prefix of the chain taking an extra &quot;a&quot;: is buta-1,3-diene. Simple cis and trans isomers may be indicated with a prefixed &quot;cis-&quot; or &quot;trans-&quot;: &quot;cis&quot;-but-2-ene, &quot;trans&quot;-but-2-ene. However, &quot;cis-&quot; and &quot;trans-&quot; are &quot;relative&quot; descriptors. It is IUPAC convention to describe all alkenes using &quot;absolute&quot; descriptors of &quot;Z-&quot; (same side) and &quot;E-&quot; (opposite) with the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules (see also E–Z notation).

===Alkynes===


Alkynes are named using the same system, with the suffix &quot;-yne&quot; indicating a triple bond: ethyne (acetylene), propyne (methylacetylene). 

==Functional groups==
===Haloalkanes and haloarenes===


In haloalkanes and haloarenes (), Halogen functional groups are prefixed with the bonding position and take the form of fluoro-, chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, etc., depending on the halogen. Multiple groups are dichloro-, trichloro-, etc., and dissimilar groups are ordered alphabetically as before. For example, (chloroform) is trichloromethane. The anesthetic halothane () is 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane.

===Alcohols===


Alcohols () take the suffix &quot;-ol&quot; with a numerical suffix indicating the bonding position: is propan-1-ol. The suffixes , , , etc., are used for multiple groups: Ethylene glycol is ethane-1,2-diol.

If higher precedence functional groups are present (see &quot;order of precedence&quot;, below), the prefix &quot;hydroxy&quot; is used with the bonding position: is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. 

===Ethers===


Ethers () consist of an oxygen atom between the two attached carbon chains. The shorter of the two chains becomes the first part of the name with the -ane suffix changed to -oxy, and the longer alkane chain becomes the suffix of the name of the ether. Thus, is methoxymethane, and is methoxyethane (&quot;not&quot; ethoxymethane). If the oxygen is not attached to the end of the main alkane chain, then the whole shorter alkyl-plus-ether group is treated as a side-chain and prefixed with its bonding position on the main chain. Thus is 2-methoxypropane.

Alternatively, an ether chain can be named as an alkane in which one carbon is replaced by an oxygen, a replacement denoted by the prefix &quot;oxa&quot;. For example, could also be called 2-oxabutane, and an epoxide could be called oxacyclopropane. This method is especially useful when both groups attached to the oxygen atom are complex.
===Aldehydes===


Aldehydes () take the suffix &quot;-al&quot;. If other functional groups are present, the chain is numbered such that the aldehyde carbon is in the &quot;1&quot; position, unless functional groups of higher precedence are present.

If a prefix form is required, &quot;oxo-&quot; is used (as for ketones), with the position number indicating the end of a chain: is 3-oxopropanoic acid. If the carbon in the carbonyl group cannot be included in the attached chain (for instance in the case of cyclic aldehydes), the prefix &quot;formyl-&quot; or the suffix &quot;-carbaldehyde&quot; is used: is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. If an aldehyde is attached to a benzene and is the main functional group, the suffix becomes benzaldehyde.

===Ketones===


In general ketones () take the suffix &quot;-one&quot; (pronounced &quot;own&quot;, not &quot;won&quot;) with a suffixed position number: is pentan-2-one. If a higher precedence suffix is in use, the prefix &quot;oxo-&quot; is used: is 3-oxohexanal. 

===Carboxylic acids===

In general, carboxylic acids () are named with the suffix &quot;-oic acid&quot; (etymologically a back-formation from benzoic acid). As with aldehydes, the carboxyl functional group must take the &quot;1&quot; position on the main chain and so the locant need not be stated. For example, (lactic acid) is named 2-hydroxypropanoic acid with no &quot;1&quot; stated. Some traditional names for common carboxylic acids (such as acetic acid) are in such widespread use that they are retained in IUPAC nomenclature, though systematic names like ethanoic acid are also used. Carboxylic acids attached to a benzene ring are structural analogs of benzoic acid () and are named as one of its derivatives.
If there are multiple carboxyl groups on the same parent chain, multiplying prefixes are used: Malonic acid, , is systematically named propanedioic acid. Alternatively, the suffix can be used in place of &quot;oic acid&quot;, combined with a multiplying prefix if necessary – mellitic acid is benzenehexacarboxylic acid, for example. In the latter case, the carbon atoms in the carboxyl groups do &quot;not&quot; count as being part of the main chain, a rule that also applies to the prefix form &quot;carboxy-&quot;. Citric acid serves as an example: it is formally named rather than .
===Carboxylates===


Salts of carboxylic acids are named following the usual cation-then-anion conventions used for ionic compounds in both IUPAC and common nomenclature systems. The name of the carboxylate anion () is derived from that of the parent acid by replacing the &quot;–oic acid&quot; ending with &quot;–oate&quot; or &quot;carboxylate.&quot; For example, , the sodium salt of benzoic acid (), is called sodium benzoate. Where an acid has both a systematic and a common name (like , for example, which is known as both acetic acid and as ethanoic acid), its salts can be named from either parent name. Thus, can be named as potassium acetate or as potassium ethanoate. The prefix form, is &quot;carboxylato-&quot;.

===Esters===


Esters () are named as alkyl derivatives of carboxylic acids. The alkyl (R&#x27;) group is named first. The part is then named as a separate word based on the carboxylic acid name, with the ending changed from &quot;-oic acid&quot; to &quot;-oate&quot; or &quot;-carboxylate&quot; For example, is methyl pentanoate, and is ethyl 4-methylpentanoate. For esters such as ethyl acetate (), ethyl formate () or dimethyl phthalate that are based on common acids, IUPAC recommends use of these established names, called retained names. The &quot;-oate&quot; changes to &quot;-ate.&quot; Some simple examples, named both ways, are shown in the figure above.

If the alkyl group is not attached at the end of the chain, the bond position to the ester group is suffixed before &quot;-yl&quot;: may be called butan-2-yl propanoate or butan-2-yl propionate.. The prefix form is &quot;oxycarbonyl-&quot; with the (R&#x27;) group preceding. 

===Acyl groups===


Acyl groups are named by stripping the &quot;-ic acid&quot; of the corresponding carboxylic acid and replacing it with &quot;-yl.&quot; For example, is called ethanoyl-R.

===Acyl halides===


Simply add the name of the attached halide to the end of the acyl group. For example, is ethanoyl chloride. An alternate suffix is &quot;-carbonyl halide&quot; as opposed to &quot;-oyl halide&quot;. The prefix form is &quot;halocarbonyl-&quot;.

===Acid anhydrides===


Acid anhydrides () have two acyl groups linked by an oxygen atom. If both acyl groups are the same, then the name of the carboxylic acid with the word acid is replaced with the word &quot;anhydride&quot; and the IUPAC name consists of two words. If the acyl groups are different, then they are named in alphabetical order in the same way, with &quot;anhydride&quot; replacing &quot;acid&quot; and IUPAC name consists of three words. For example, is called &quot;ethanoic anhydride&quot; and is called &quot;ethanoic propanoic anhydride&quot;.

===Amines===


Amines () are named for the attached alkane chain with the suffix &quot;-amine&quot; (e.g., methanamine). If necessary, the bonding position is suffixed: propan-1-amine, propan-2-amine. The prefix form is &quot;amino-&quot;.

For secondary amines (of the form ), the longest carbon chain attached to the nitrogen atom becomes the primary name of the amine; the other chain is prefixed as an alkyl group with location prefix given as an italic &quot;N&quot;: is &quot;N&quot;-methylethanamine. Tertiary amines () are treated similarly: is &quot;N&quot;-ethyl-&quot;N&quot;-methylpropanamine. Again, the substituent groups are ordered alphabetically.

===Amides===


Amides () take the suffix &quot;-amide&quot;, or &quot;-carboxamide&quot; if the carbon in the amide group cannot be included in the main chain. The prefix form is &quot;carbamoyl-&quot;. e.g., methanamide, ethanamide.

Amides that have additional substituents on the nitrogen are treated similarly to the case of amines: they are ordered alphabetically with the location prefix &quot;N&quot;: is &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylmethanamide, is &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylethanamide.

===Nitriles===


Nitriles () are named by adding the suffix &quot;-nitrile&quot; to the longest hydrocarbon chain (including the carbon of the cyano group). It can also be named by replacing the &quot;-oic acid&quot; of their corresponding carboxylic acids with &quot;-carbonitrile.&quot; The prefix form is &quot;cyano-.&quot; Functional class IUPAC nomenclature may also be used in the form of alkyl cyanides. For example, is called pentanenitrile or butyl cyanide.

===Cyclic compounds===


Cycloalkanes and aromatic compounds can be treated as the main parent chain of the compound, in which case the positions of substituents are numbered around the ring structure. For example, the three isomers of xylene , commonly the &quot;ortho-&quot;, &quot;meta-&quot;, and &quot;para-&quot; forms, are 1,2-dimethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, and 1,4-dimethylbenzene. The cyclic structures can also be treated as functional groups themselves, in which case they take the prefix &quot;cyclo&quot;alkyl&quot;-&quot; (e.g. &quot;cyclohexyl-&quot;) or for benzene, &quot;phenyl-&quot;.

The IUPAC nomenclature scheme becomes rapidly more elaborate for more complex cyclic structures, with notation for compounds containing conjoined rings, and many common names such as phenol being accepted as base names for compounds derived from them.

==Order of precedence of group==
When compounds contain more than one functional group, the order of precedence determines which groups are named with prefix or suffix forms. The table below shows common groups in decreasing order of precedence. The highest-precedence group takes the suffix, with all others taking the prefix form. However, double and triple bonds only take suffix form (-en and -yn) and are used with other suffixes.

Prefixed substituents are ordered alphabetically (excluding any modifiers such as di-, tri-, etc.), e.g. chlorofluoromethane, &quot;not&quot; fluorochloromethane. If there are multiple functional groups of the same type, either prefixed or suffixed, the position numbers are ordered numerically (thus ethane-1,2-diol, &quot;not&quot; ethane-2,1-diol.) The &quot;N&quot; position indicator for amines and amides comes before &quot;1&quot;, e.g., is &quot;N&quot;,2-dimethylpropanamine.

The order of remaining functional groups is only needed for substituted benzene and hence is not mentioned here.

==Common nomenclature – trivial names==
Common nomenclature uses the older names for some organic compounds instead of using the prefixes for the carbon skeleton above. The pattern can be seen below.
===Ketones===
Common names for ketones can be derived by naming the two alkyl or aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group as separate words followed by the word &quot;ketone&quot;.
*Acetone
*Acetophenone
*Benzophenone
*Ethyl isopropyl ketone
*Diethyl ketone

The first three of the names shown above are still considered to be acceptable IUPAC names.

===Aldehydes===
The common name for an aldehyde is derived from the common name of the corresponding carboxylic acid by dropping the word &quot;acid&quot; and changing the suffix from -ic or -oic to -aldehyde.
*Formaldehyde
*Acetaldehyde

==Ions==
The IUPAC nomenclature also provides rules for naming ions.

===Hydron===
Hydron is a generic term for hydrogen cation; protons, deuterons and tritons are all hydrons.
The hydrons are not found in heavier isotopes, however.

===Parent hydride cations===
Simple cations formed by adding a hydron to a hydride of a halogen, chalcogen or pnictogen are named by adding the suffix &quot;-onium&quot; to the element&#x27;s root: is ammonium, is oxonium, and H2F+ is fluoronium. Ammonium was adopted instead of nitronium, which commonly refers to .

If the cationic center of the hydride is not a halogen, chalcogen or pnictogen then the suffix &quot;-ium&quot; is added to the name of the neutral hydride after dropping any final &#x27;e&#x27;. is methanium, is dioxidanium (HO-OH is dioxidane), and is diazanium ( is diazane).

===Cations and substitution===
The above cations except for methanium are not, strictly speaking, organic, since they do not contain carbon. However, many organic cations are obtained by substituting another element or some functional group for a hydrogen.

The name of each substitution is prefixed to the hydride cation name. If many substitutions by the same functional group occur, then the number is indicated by prefixing with &quot;di-&quot;, &quot;tri-&quot; as with halogenation. is trimethyloxonium. is trifluoromethylammonium.

<doc id="514406" wikidata="Q2756457" url="?curid=514406" title="VF-1 Valkyrie">
<text>In the &quot;Macross&quot; Japanese anime series and its English adaptation &quot;Robotech&quot;, the first mass-produced transforming aerospace fighter mecha is called the VF-1 Valkyrie. The VF-1 Valkyrie is referred to as a &quot;variable fighter&quot; in &quot;Macross&quot;.

==Background==
The VF-1 was created between 1980 and 1982 by Japanese mecha designer Shoji Kawamori with contributions by his Studio Nue partner Kazutaka Miyatake. The VF-1 Valkyrie was to be the centerpiece mecha design for the anime series &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; which aired between 1982 and 1983. The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle and Grumman F-14 Tomcat with its variable-sweep wing design, served as the main design inspiration of the VF-1. When it came to naming &quot;Valkyrie&quot; was used as a tribute to the real world XB-70 Valkyrie, which was an experimental supersonic strategic bomber developed in the United States in the 1960s. The VF-1 was created entirely by Kawamori and Studio Nue.

==Fictional fighter design==
===Macross===
In &quot;Macross&quot;, the VF-1 was developed by Stonewell/Bellcom/Shinnakasu for the U.N. Spacy by using alien &quot;Overtechnology&quot; obtained from the SDF-1 Macross alien spaceship. It was preceded into production by an aerodynamic proving version of its airframe, the VF-X. Unlike all later VF vehicles, the VF-X was strictly a jet aircraft, built to demonstrate that a jet fighter with the features necessary to convert to Battroid mode was aerodynamically feasible. After the VF-X&#x27;s testing was finished, an advanced concept atmospheric-only prototype, the VF-0 Phoenix, was flight-tested from 2005 to 2007 and briefly served as an active-duty fighter from 2007 to the VF-1&#x27;s rollout in late 2008, while the bugs were being worked out of the full-up VF-1 prototype (VF-X-1). The VF-1&#x27;s combat debut was on February 7, 2009, during the Battle of South Ataria Island - the first battle of Space War I, and was the mainstay fighter of the U.N. Spacy for the entire conflict. Introduced in 2008, the VF-1 would be out of frontline service just five years later, replaced by the far more advanced VF-4 Lightning III. However, the fighter would continue to show its worthiness years later when, during the events of Macross 7, Milia Jenius (a major character in the original series) would use her old fighter in defense of the colonization fleet.

===Robotech===
In &quot;Robotech&quot;, development of the Valkyrie began at the end of the Global Civil War, when an alien spaceship crashed into Macross Island in the South Pacific. After learning of the existence of large aggressive humanoid aliens, a United Earth Government was formed and development began on the mecha by the Robotech Defense Force to combat the alien threat by using &quot;Robotechnology&quot; obtained from the SDF-1 alien ship.

In the &quot;Robotech&quot; continuity, the VF-0 did not exist; the non-transformable VF-X was followed by a version which had only fighter and Guardian mode. Not until June 2007 was the final version of the VF-1, which could transform into battloid mode, released. It unofficially saw its first combat in early 2007, when test pilot Roy Fokker &quot;borrowed&quot; the first production-model aircraft - a VF-1S that would remain his mount for the rest of his life, and become Rick Hunter&#x27;s aircraft after his death - to thwart an Anti-Unification plot to destroy the three primary symbols of UEG power. Officially, the first combat of the VF-1 was, like &quot;Macross&quot;, February 7, 2009, during the Battle of Macross Island - the first battle of the First Robotech War. Much like its &quot;Macross&quot; counterpart, the VF-1 would remain in service for the remainder of the conflict.

===Modes===
The VF-1 is different from modern fighter aircraft in that it can transform into three different configurations or modes for different combat environments, and can perform the task of more than one fighting vehicle: In Fighter mode it can act as a jet fighter or a space fighter; in GERWALK (or Guardian in &quot;Robotech&quot;) mode it acts as a VTOL unit or a &quot;chicken walker&quot; mecha; in Battroid mode (or Battloid in &quot;Robotech&quot;) it acts as a humanoid mecha.

====Fighter mode====

The VF-1&#x27;s Fighter mode is its basic mode and is the typical mode employed when the craft is parked at a military base and is the primary mode used in high altitude aerial combat planetside and in space combat.

In this mode, it features a basic fuselage similar to the real-world F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, including underslung intakes and variable-sweep wing, but with outward-canted vertical stabilizers similar to the F/A-18 Hornet&#x27;s, swiveling under-wing hardpoints (last seen on the F-111 Aardvark, Su-24 Fencer, and Panavia Tornado), and a total lack of tailplanes. It is armed with 1, 2, or 4 (depending on model) Mauler RÖV-20 laser cannons mounted on a ventral turret, a GU-11 55mm three-barrelled gun pod holding 200 rounds, four underwing hardpoints holding up to twelve medium-range AMM-1 missiles, twelve Mk-82 LDGP bombs, six RMS-1 large anti-ship reaction missiles or four UUM-7 micro-missile pods containing up to 15 Bifors HMM-01 &quot;micro-missiles&quot;. Like most of the VF-1&#x27;s nomenclature, the &quot;GU&quot; and &quot;AMM&quot; designations of its weapons are references to current US military designations (GPU for Gun Pod Unit and AIM for Air Intercept Missile).

In fighter mode the VF-1&#x27;s thermonuclear engines and the several vernier rockets on its fuselage make it capable of operating as an aerospace fighter. It can reach a maximum speed of Mach 3.87 at high altitude (above ), and Mach 2.71 at medium altitude (). Its wings, similar to those of the F-14 Tomcat, sweep between 20 degrees back and 72 degrees back. Unlike the F-14, the wings can sweep 90 degrees back for storage, with the tail module folding up over the fighter&#x27;s back. Although the VF-1 technically has an unlimited service ceiling and atmospheric range (since it can operate in space), the VF-1&#x27;s internal tanks cannot carry enough propellant to achieve a stable orbit and needs the help of a booster pack to reach Low Earth Orbit.

While in fighter mode, the VF-1 can also be equipped with a FAST (Fuel And Sensor Tactical) Pack space booster and weaponry system. This system vastly improves the speed and survivability of the fighter as well as giving it access to extra ammunition. The FAST pack isn&#x27;t adapted for atmospheric use, due to its impact on a Valkyrie&#x27;s aerodynamics and its weight; as such, it needs to be discarded before atmospheric entry. Contrary to the GBP-1S (see below), the FAST pack doesn&#x27;t prevent transformation.

Fighter mode has two sub-modes:
* In atmospheric mode the engine air intakes are open; wings geometry is flexible.
* In space mode the engine air intakes are closed. Wings remain extended but fixed due to the presence of vernier thrusters on the wing tips, and wing-carried ordnance.

The shield that covers the cockpit in Battroid mode is usually absent, except on pilot&#x27;s request for use as a heat shield, for example in case of atmospheric re-entry (seen performed in the original &quot;Macross&quot; series in episode 27).

====GERWALK mode====

In GERWALK (Ground Effective Reinforcement of Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint) mode (called &quot;Guardian Mode&quot; in &quot;Robotech&quot;), the VF-1 looks like the nose and wings of a fighter plane stuck on &quot;chicken walker&quot; legs with two arms. The legs are formed by the aircraft&#x27;s engines and intakes, bent down and forward. The arms are stored between the engines in fighter mode and fold out to the sides, reaching around from behind the legs. In GERWALK mode, the gun pod is held by the fighter&#x27;s manipulator &quot;hands&quot; and acts in all respects as a very large automatic rifle. This mode is the intermediate one which was originally intended to simply allow the craft to land in a combat zone with a maximum of defensive ability. However, many pilots soon realized that this mode&#x27;s considerable maneuverability combined with its speed made it formidable in low level aerial combat as well as when making flanking maneuvers on the ground, and most took advantage of these characteristics for such situations. Valkyrie pilots also have the option to deploy the legs alone, leaving the arms in storage.

According to an article in &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine, the form came about partially by accident. Early in the development cycle for &quot;Macross&quot;, the creators planned a main mecha called &quot;GA-WALK&quot;, with an ostrich-like leg configuration (similar to the enemy battle pods from the finished series). However, the idea met with resistance from the initial sponsor, which wanted a more conventional robot for the hero to pilot. When creator Shoji Kawamori designed the transforming &quot;Breast Fighters&quot; (later redesigned and renamed the &quot;VF-1 Valkyrie&quot; fighters) instead, he had no real thoughts of a third mode. But when the manufacturer Takatoku Toys sent along the prototype of a Valkyrie toy for his input, the prototype&#x27;s legs were not yet locked into place in Fighter mode, causing the legs to swing down. This was reminiscent to him of the discarded &quot;GA-WALK&quot; mecha idea that had been shot down early in pre-production. He liked the idea, and worked to incorporate the third mode, now renamed &quot;GERWALK,&quot; into &quot;Macross&quot;. In GERWALK mode, the VF-1 has a maximum speed of flying, walking.

====Battroid mode====

In Battroid mode (called &quot;Battloid Mode&quot; in &quot;Robotech&quot;), the VF-1 looks like a fighter airplane folded up to resemble a 12.7-meter-tall (42-foot-tall) humanoid. The legs are now straight and bend in the normal direction; the sides of the nose now resemble a human chest and shoulders (where the arms attach), and the laser turret is now a head.

While the Battroid mode has some limited altitude control, its primary purpose is for ground hand-to-hand combat, which enabled Earth forces to fight the giant alien invaders on their own scale as the military had anticipated they would need. As shown in the original TV series, this mode allowed the humans to disguise their VF-1 as a Zentradi officer and to infiltrate one of their warships during a rescue operation. The VF-1 valkyrie in battroid mode is also much stronger than the average Zentradi soldier and is able to defeat them in unarmed combat with ease. However, the superior size, physical strength, endurance and resistance to space vacuum of Commander Type Zentradi makes them much more dangerous and equal opponents for the Valkyrie.

In Battroid mode, the VF-1 has a maximum airspeed of . Its maximum running speed is . In this mode, the Valkyrie can also be equipped with a reactive armor package called the GBP-1S Ground Battle Protector weapon system. Manufactured by &quot;Shinnakasu Heavy Industries&quot; this pack is armed with fifty-six diameter &quot;Erlikon&quot; GH-32 Grenade Crusher high maneuverability micro-missiles (twenty-two mounted in two shoulder launchers, ten mounted in two chest launchers, sixteen mounted in side leg launchers, and eight mounted in rear leg launchers), eighteen &quot;Erlikon&quot; GA-100 Crusher high-speed armor-penetrating projectiles mounted in two lower arm launchers, and six &quot;Remington&quot; H-22T large hand grenades mounted on torso. This armor pack has to be ejected to allow the Valkyrie&#x27;s transformation into GERWALK and Fighter modes.

===Variants===
The VF-1 &quot;Valkyrie&quot; is a variable geometry aerospace fighter built in four main variants). The four models differ slightly in engines, avionics, and armament:
* VF-1A: a standard soldier&#x27;s fighter. Has one laser cannon on its head.
* VF-1D: a two-seat variant of the VF-1A. Has two lasers. (used as a trainer in &quot;Robotech&quot;).
* VF-1J: a team leader/squadron commander&#x27;s fighter. Has two lasers.
* VF-1S: a squadron commander/Commander Air Group&#x27;s fighter. Has four lasers.
* VF-1R: a variation of the VF-1A as a mid-life upgrade to improve survivability. It features powerplant and armor upgrades, as well as an additional pulse cannon mounted as a third cannon on the head which will automatically target incoming missiles without pilot input and free up the pilot&#x27;s mind for more important tasks. Originally thought to be an animation mistake in Episode 32, but Harmony Gold capitalized on it in the 2000s to introduce a new character (Jack Archer from the Robotech: Battlecry video game) and model.
* VT-1: a two-seat unarmed primary trainer (&quot;Macross&quot; only).
* There are several less frequently used variants.

===Toys===
====Takatoku Toys/Bandai====
In 1983, Takatoku Toys released a range of &quot;Macross&quot; toys. Their first release was the 1/55 VF-1 Battroid Valkyrie, which was the first fully transformable replica of the VF-1. The toy was licensed by Hasbro for release in their markets as part of the &quot;Transformers&quot; toyline, and was retooled to become the character Jetfire. Due to Hasbro licensing the toy, Matchbox was unable to release it as part of the &quot;Robotech&quot; toyline (instead, Matchbox opted to release a semi-transformable version scaled to fit a 3 3/4&quot; action figure with the Valkyrie/Veritech&#x27;s proportions selectively compressed). Takatoku released the smaller 1/100 VF-1S Battroid Valkyrie later in the same year. In 1984, Bandai acquired the molds of the Valkyrie toy from Matsushiro Toys (which had obtained them from a bankrupt Takatoku Toys months prior) and used them as the basis for a new range. To coincide with the release of the film &quot;&quot;, Bandai released the 1/55 Hi-Metal VF-1A Valkyrie with the newer paint scheme used by Hikaru Ichijyo. This was followed in the same year by the VT-1 Super Ostrich and VE-1 ELINT Seeker, as well as the VF-1S Strike Valkyrie.

Throughout the years, Bandai has reissued the 1/55 VF-1 Valkyrie toy line in Japan during anniversary celebrations of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise - most recently in 2008 as part of &quot;Macross&quot;&#x27;s 25th anniversary and the launch of &quot;Macross Frontier&quot;.

In 2010, Bandai released an all-new transformable 1/100 VF-1 Valkyrie toy under their VF Hi-Metal line.

====Yamato Toys/Arcadia====
In 2001, Yamato Toys released their 1/60 VF-1 Valkyrie line. Two years later, they unveiled their 1/48 scale Valkyrie, which went into production until 2007 with limited reissues in 2010. In 2008, Yamato used design and engineering cues from the 1/48 line to release newer versions of their 1/60 line. An unpainted, unassembled kit version of their 1/60 VF-1S Valkyrie was released in 2010. This kit is targeted to collectors who are into customizing their Valkyrie collection.

In 2009, Yamato Toys released their Valkyrie Battroid figures on their GN-U Dou line to compete with Kaiyodo&#x27;s Revoltech figures. Despite being non-transformable, these figures boast exceptional articulation and poseability.

In 2013, Yamato Toys was restructured into Arcadia. The company is in the process of reissuing their 1/60 VF-1 Valkyrie replicas.

====Toynami====
In 2002, Toynami released a &quot;Robotech Masterpiece Collection&quot; range of products. Included in this range was a series of fully transformable VF-1 models in collector&#x27;s packaging. Following the end of the &quot;Macross Saga&quot; of the Masterpiece Collection, Toynami released 1/100 scale VF-1 toys in 2006 that were marketed as &quot;Macross&quot; toys rather than &quot;Robotech&quot; toys. This lineup also included the &quot;Do You Remember Love?&quot; variants. These toys were released mainly for the North American market.

====Kaiyodo====
Kaiyodo released a series of VF-1 Valkyrie Battroid figures on their Revoltech line in 2006. Despite not being transformable, these figures boast extreme points of articulation and poseability. Transformable versions of the Revoltech VF-1 Valkyrie figures were released in early 2010. These figures are currently being offered in the United States by Harmony Gold USA through Robotech.com.

====ThreeZero====
ThreeZero released the fully transformable VF-1J and VF-1S figures as part of Robo-Dou line under license from Harmony Gold USA and Crunchyroll.

===Model kits===
During the run of the original &quot;Macross&quot; series, model kits of the VF-1 Valkyrie were released in Japan by Arii, Imai, and Nichimo. Most of these were non-transformable and required glue and paint to assemble, but variable types were also released in 1/100 and 1/72 scale. These transformed into all three modes, but required swapping the front fuselage for Battroid mode. Many of these kits were imported into the U.S. by Revell under the &quot;Robotech Defenders&quot; line. When Imai went out of business, the molds of their &quot;Macross&quot; model kits were acquired by Bandai, who reissued the kits throughout the 1990s. In 1999, Arii released the 1/24 scale VF-1S Valkyrie fighter kit, which is the largest scale replica of the Valkyrie to date.

In 2001, Big West commissioned Hasegawa Corporation to manufacture new 1/72 model kits of the VF-1. As Hasegawa&#x27;s products are geared towards more experienced modelers, their Valkyrie kits are very accurately detailed. Since the VF-1, Hasegawa has released kits of variable fighters from most of the other Macross series as well.

In 2013, Bandai released an all-new 1/72 scale transforming kit of the VF-1 Valkyrie to celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Macross&quot;. Unlike previous transforming kits, this model is capable of perfect transformation without the need of swapping parts. In addition, the transformation to Battroid mode utilizes retractable actuators that are accurate to the original line art.

<text>An epithet (, ), also a byname, is a descriptive term (word or phrase) commonly accompanying or occurring in place of the name of a real or fictitious person, place, or thing. It is usually literally descriptive, as in Alfred the Great, Suleiman the Magnificent, Richard the Lionheart, and Ladislaus the Short, or allusive, as in Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Æthelred the Unready, John Lackland, Mehmed the Conqueror and Bloody Mary.

The word &quot;epithet&quot; also may refer to an abusive, defamatory, or derogatory word or phrase. This use is criticized by Martin Manser and other proponents of linguistic prescription. H. W. Fowler noted in 1926 that &quot;&quot;epithet&quot; is suffering a vulgarization that is giving it an abusive imputation.&quot;

==Linguistics==
Epithets are sometimes attached to a person&#x27;s name or appear in place of their name, as what might be described as a glorified nickname or sobriquet, and for this reason some linguists have argued that they should be considered as pronouns. It has also been argued that epithets are a phenomenon with the syntax–semantics interface, because they have components of both, and also a pragmatic dimension.

An epithet is linked to its noun by long-established usage. Not every adjective is an epithet. An epithet is especially recognizable when its function is largely decorative, such as if &quot;cloud-gathering Zeus&quot; is employed other than in reference to conjuring up a storm. &quot;The epithets are decorative insofar as they are neither essential to the immediate context nor modeled especially for it. Among other things, they are extremely helpful to fill out a half-verse&quot;, Walter Burkert has noted.

Some epithets are known by the Latin term , as they are required to distinguish the bearers, as an alternative to numbers after a prince&#x27;s name—such as Richard the Lionheart (Richard I of England), or Charles the Fat alongside Charles the Bald. The same epithet can be used repeatedly joined to different names, such as Alexander the Great as well as Constantine the Great.

Other epithets can easily be omitted without serious risk of confusion and are therefore known as . Thus, the classical Roman author Virgil systematically called his main hero , the epithet being , meaning religiously observant, humble and wholesome, as well as calling the armsbearer of Aeneas , the epithet being , which means faithful or loyal.

==Literature==
Epithets are characteristic of the style of ancient epic poetry, notably in that of Homer or the northern European sagas (see above, as well as epithets in Homer). When James Joyce uses the phrase &quot;the snot-green sea&quot; he is playing Homer&#x27;s familiar epithet &quot;the wine-dark sea&quot;. The phrase &quot;Discreet Telemachus&quot; is also considered an epithet.

The Greek term , in rhetoric, means substituting any epithet or phrase for a proper name, as &quot;Pelides&quot;, signifying the &quot;son of Peleus&quot;, to identify Achilles. An opposite substitution of a proper name for some generic term is also sometimes called , as a Cicero for an orator. The use of a father&#x27;s name or ancestor&#x27;s name, such as &quot;Pelides&quot; in the case of Achilles, or &quot;Saturnia&quot; in the case of the goddess Juno in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, is specifically called a patronymic device and is in its own class of epithet.

In William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, epithets are used in the prologue, such as &quot;star-cross&#x27;d lovers&quot; and &quot;death-mark&#x27;d love.&quot;

Epithets were in layman&#x27;s terms glorified nicknames that could be used to represent one&#x27;s style, artistic nature, or even geographical reference. They originated to simply serve the purpose of dealing with names that were hard to pronounce or just unpleasant. It from there went to something that could be very significant assigned by elders or counterparts to represent one&#x27;s position in the community, or it could be a representation of whomever one wanted to be or thought he was. The elegance of this movement was used throughout history and even modern day, with many examples ranging from &quot;Aphrodite the Heavenly &amp; Zeus the Protector of Guests&quot; all the way to &quot;Johnny Football &amp; King James&quot;.

American comic books tend to give epithets to superheroes, such as The Phantom being &quot;The Ghost Who Walks&quot;, Superman called &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;, and &quot;The Dynamic Duo&quot; Batman and Robin, who are individually known as &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;The Boy Wonder&quot;.

Additionally, , the Spanish version of epithet, is commonly used throughout poems in Castilian literature.

==Religion==

In many polytheistic religions, such as those of ancient India and Iran (the most ancient of which go back to a common Indo-Iranian period), Greece and Rome, a deity&#x27;s epithets generally reflected a particular aspect of that god&#x27;s essence and role, for which their influence may be obtained for a specific occasion: Apollo is &quot;Apollo, [as] leader of the Muses&quot; and therefore patron of the arts and sciences, while &quot;Phoibos&quot; Apollo is the same deity, but as shining sun-god. &quot;Athena protects the city as , oversees handicrafts as , joins battle as and grants victory as .&quot;

Alternatively, the epithet may identify a particular and localized aspect of the god, such as a reference to the mythological place of birth or numinous presence at a specific sanctuary: sacrifice might be offered on one and the same occasion to Pythian Apollo (&quot;Apollo Pythios&quot;) and Delphic Apollo (&quot;Apollo Delphinios&quot;). A localizing epithet refers simply to a particular center of veneration and the cultic tradition there, as the god manifested at a particular festival, for example: Zeus Olympios, Zeus as present at Olympia, or Apollo Karneios, Apollo at the Spartan Carneian festival.

Often the epithet is the result of fusion of the Olympian divinity with an older one. Poseidon Erechtheus and Artemis Orthia reflect intercultural equations of a divinity with an older one that is generally considered its pendan. Thus, most Roman gods and goddesses, especially the Twelve Olympians, had traditional counterparts in Greek, Etruscan, and most other Mediterranean pantheons, such as Jupiter as head of the Olympian Gods with Zeus. But in specific cults there may be a different equation, based on one specific aspect of the divinity. Thus, the Greek word (&quot;thrice grand&quot;) was first used as a Greek name for the Egyptian god of science and invention, Thoth, later as an for the Greek Hermes and, finally, the fully equated Roman Mercurius Mercury (both were messenger of the gods). Among the Greeks, T.H. Price notes that the nurturing power of might be invoked in sacrifices and recorded in inscription, without specifically identifying Hera or Demeter.

Some epithets were applied to several deities of the same pantheon rather accidentally if they had a common characteristic, or deliberately, emphasizing their blood or other ties. Thus, in pagan Rome, several divinities gods and heroes were given the &quot;Comes&quot; as companion of another (usually major) divinity. An epithet can even be meant for collective use, e.g., in Latin , &quot;the felt hat-wearers&quot; for the brothers Castor and Pollux. Some epithets resist explanation.

Catholics, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Christians of other churches practice the use of epithets in the veneration of Jesus (e.g., &quot;Christ&quot;; &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;; &quot;The Good Shepherd&quot;), of Mary, Mother of Jesus (e.g., &quot;Mother of God&quot;; &quot;Panagia&quot;), and of the saints (e.g., &quot;Pope Saint John Paul the Great, Saint Theophan the Recluse&quot;). &quot;Our Lady of Lourdes&quot; is essentially periphrasis, except where some aspect of the Virgin is invoked.

==Rhetoric==

An epithet is an adjective or adjectival phrase that characterizes a place, a thing, or a person that helps make the characteristics of this thing more prominent. These descriptive phrases can be used in a positive or negative way that benefits the orator. &quot;It will generally happen, that the Epithets employed by a skillful orator, will be found to be, in fact, so many abridged arguments, the force of which is sufficiently conveyed by a mere hint; e.g., if any one says, &#x27;We ought to take warning from the bloody revolution of France,&#x27; the Epithet suggests one of the reasons for our being warned; and that, not less clearly, and more forcibly, than if the argument had been stated at length.&quot; With persuasion being a key component of rhetoric, it is rational to use epithets. The use of persuasive wording gives leverage to one&#x27;s arguments. Knowledge along with descriptive words or phrases can be a powerful tool. This is supported in Bryan Short&#x27;s article when he states, &quot;The New Rhetoric derives its empiricist flavor from a pervasive respect for clarity and directness of language.&quot; Rhetoricians use epithets to direct their audience to see their point of view, using verbal forms of imagery as a persuasive tactic.

Orators have a variety of epithets that they can employ that have different meanings. The most common are fixed epithets and transferred epithets. A fixed epithet is the repetitive use of the same word or phrase for the same person or object. A transferred epithet qualifies a noun other than the person or thing it is describing. This is also known as a hypallage. This can often involve shifting a modifier from the animate to the inanimate; for example, &quot;cheerful money&quot; and &quot;suicidal sky&quot;.

Orators take special care when using epithets so as to not use them as smear words. Orators could be accused of racial or abusive epithets if used incorrectly. American journalist William Safire discussed the use of the word in a 2008 column in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;&#x27;I am working on a piece about nationalism with a focus on epithet as a smear word,&#x27; writes David Binder, my longtime Times colleague, &#x27;which was still a synonym for &#x27;delineation&#x27; or &#x27;characterization&#x27; in my big 1942 Webster&#x27;s but now seems to be almost exclusively a synonym for &#x27;derogation&#x27; or &#x27;smear word.&#x27; ... In the past century, [epithet] blossomed as &#x27;a word of abuse,&#x27; today gleefully seized upon to describe political smears.&quot;

==Usage prior to surnames==

Descriptive bynames were given to a person to distinguish them from other people of the same name. In England, bynames were used during the period when the use of surnames had not been extensively adopted. As an example, the Domesday Book of 1086 identifies 40 individuals with the given name of &quot;Richard&quot;. Most (40%), such as &quot;Richard of Coursey&quot; are identified with a locational byname, indicating where they came from, or in some cases where they lived. Others (25%), such as &quot;Richard the butler&quot; and &quot;Richard the bald&quot; are identified with an occupational or a personally descriptive byname. Some of the individuals, such as Richard Basset, made use of what would now be recognized as a surname.

The distinction between a byname and a surname is that the byname is not usually heritable, and may change for any given person as his circumstances change. Richard the Bald, for example, was presumably not always bald, and Richard of Brampton may not have always lived at Brampton.

The use of bynames did not end with the adoption of surnames. In some cases, before the adoption of middle names, government records, such as taxes lists, included people with both the same given name and the same surname. This led to the use of bynames to further distinguish the person. For example, one &quot;John Smith&quot; might be described as &quot;John Smith of the mill&quot;, while another might be described as &quot;John Smith the short&quot;.

<text>Paul James O&#x27;Grady (14 June 1955 – 28 March 2023) was an English comedian, broadcaster, drag queen, actor, and writer. He achieved notability in the London gay scene during the 1980s with his drag persona Lily Savage, through which he gained wider popularity in the 1990s. O&#x27;Grady subsequently dropped the character and in the 2000s became the presenter of various television and radio shows, including &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.
Born to a working-class Irish migrant family in Tranmere, Cheshire, O&#x27;Grady moved to London in the late 1970s, initially working as a peripatetic care officer for Camden Council. He developed his drag act in 1978, basing the character of Lily Savage upon traits found among female relatives. Touring England as part of drag mime duo the Playgirls, O&#x27;Grady then went solo as a stand-up comedian in the early 1980s. Performing as Savage for eight years at a South London gay pub, the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT), he gained a popular following among London&#x27;s gay community and used his character to speak out for gay rights. After being nominated for a 1992 Perrier Comedy Award, O&#x27;Grady attracted mainstream attention and made various television, radio, and theatrical appearances. As Savage, he presented the television shows &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; (1995–1996), &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; (1997–2002), and &quot;Lily Live!&quot; (2000–2001), earning various awards and becoming a well known public figure.
Wishing to diversify from Savage, O&#x27;Grady starred in the BBC One sitcom &quot;Eyes Down&quot; (2003–2004) and presented two travel documentaries for ITV. In 2004, he began presenting ITV&#x27;s daytime chat show &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. After the network refused to transfer creative control of the series to O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s production company Olga TV, he moved to Channel 4 in 2006, where the show was rebranded as &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show,&quot; airing until 2009. O&#x27;Grady presented the late night ITV show &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot; (2010–2011) and BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady on the Wireless&quot; (2009–2022). Additional television shows included &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady: For the Love of Dogs&quot; (2012–2023), &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Animal Orphans&quot; (2014–2016), &quot;Blind Date&quot; (2017–2019), and &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Great British Escape&quot; (2020). He also published several books, including a four-volume memoir.
O&#x27;Grady was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours for services to entertainment. In 2020 he became president of the British Music Hall Society, taking over the role from Roy Hudd. On 31 October 2022 he was appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant for the County of Kent, where he lived for many years.

==Early life==

=== 1955–1971: Childhood ===
O&#x27;Grady was born on 14 June 1955 at St. Catherine&#x27;s Hospital in the Tranmere area of Birkenhead, Cheshire (now Merseyside). His father, Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Grady (1912–1973), was Irish and had grown up in Ballincurry, County Roscommon, before moving to England in 1936 and settling in the working-class area of Birkenhead. His name was changed from &quot;Grady&quot; to &quot;O&#x27;Grady&quot; in a paperwork mistake when he joined the Royal Air Force, and he kept the new name. Patrick married Mary &quot;Molly&quot; Savage (1916–1988), who was born in England to Irish immigrants from County Louth. Paul was their third child; his birth came over a decade after those of brother Brendan (born 1941) and sister Sheila (born 1944).

O&#x27;Grady spent his early life at the family&#x27;s rented home at 23 Holly Grove in Higher Tranmere. He later said, &quot;When I look back on my childhood I have no bad memories. Our family was loving and full of affection. I never knew what divorce was until I moved to London. I was an indulged child and completely protected from anything bad.&quot; Attending St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, O&#x27;Grady excelled in all subjects except mathematics. Hoping that he had a good future ahead of him, his parents budgeted to send him to a private school, the Catholic-run Redcourt, but his grades dropped. Failing the eleven plus exam, he was unable to enter a grammar school so attended the Blessed Edward Campion R.C. Secondary Modern and the Corpus Christi High School. It was at the school that O&#x27;Grady experienced his first homosexual encounter, enjoying a brief romance with another boy, although he still assumed he was heterosexual.

A fan of the popular television series &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, O&#x27;Grady was enrolled in the Cub Scouts by his mother, but he hated it, leaving after a month. An altar boy at a local Catholic church, he was dismissed after laughing during a funeral service. He then joined the Marine Cadet Section of the Sea Cadet Corps, later commenting that he was following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, the cartoon character Popeye. He enjoyed the cadets, and at the advice of his captain joined the Boys&#x27; Amateur Boxing Club, developing a lifelong love of the sport. Playing truant from school, he got into trouble with his parents, and subsequently with the police after burgling a house with three friends. O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s first job was a paper round that he kept for a week, and through this and other jobs, he saved up to afford Mod clothes, for a time becoming a suedehead.

=== 1972–1977: Early adulthood ===
Leaving school aged 16, O&#x27;Grady obtained a job in the civil service, working as a clerical assistant for the DHSS at their Liverpool office; he commuted in from his parents&#x27; Tranmere home. Supplementing this income, he worked part-time at the bar of the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA) club in Oxton. Called for a disciplinary hearing at the DHSS and accused of incompetent behaviour and tardiness, he resigned. Obtaining a job at the Wheatsheaf Hotel in Virginia Water, Surrey, aged 17, O&#x27;Grady moved there; the management accused him of stealing, which he denied.

Promptly returning to Birkenhead, he increasingly socialised within the Liverpudlian gay scene, attending meetings of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality and working at a gay bar called the Bear&#x27;s Paw; this was kept a secret from his parents, to whom he was not &quot;out of the closet&quot;. He also had casual sex with a female friend, Diane Jansen, who became pregnant, news which O&#x27;Grady discovered in the same week that both his parents suffered heart attacks; his mother made a recovery, but his father died. Following the birth of his daughter, Sharon Lee Jansen, in May 1974, O&#x27;Grady agreed to pay towards her upkeep, but refused to marry Jansen, recognising his homosexuality.

Briefly working as an assistant clerk at Liverpool Magistrates&#x27; Court, O&#x27;Grady subsequently worked as a barman at Yates&#x27;s Wine Lodge, supplementing the income with the occasional night at the Bear&#x27;s Paw. Realising this wage was insufficient to support both himself and his daughter, he travelled to London, lodging in Westbourne Green, but found only poorly paid work as a barman. In London, he began associating with drag queens, particularly a couple who used the stage name of the Harlequeens. Although making friends in the city, O&#x27;Grady was homesick and returned to Birkenhead. Employed as an accountant in a FMC Meats Merseyside abattoir, he then worked for three years at the Children&#x27;s Convalescent Home and School in West Kirby, a home for disabled and abused children.

Returning to London, he rented a flat in Crouch End and began busking with a friend in Camden Town before obtaining a job as a physiotherapist&#x27;s assistant at the Royal Northern Hospital. Made redundant by public sector cuts, O&#x27;Grady took up a job at a gay club called the Showplace, befriending a Portuguese lesbian named Teresa Fernandes. In May 1977, they married to prevent her deportation; they lost contact and only legally divorced in 2005. Taking up jobs as a cleaner and a waiter at private functions, he began working for Camden Council as a peripatetic care officer. Living in with elderly people and dysfunctional families would have a lasting effect on him.

==Career in drag==

=== 1978–1984: Lily Savage and the drag circuit ===

While working for Camden Social Services, O&#x27;Grady made his first attempt at putting together a drag act, creating the character of Lily Savage; he later said, &quot;I wanted to get up there but be larger than life, a creature that was more cartoon than human.&quot; His debut was on the afternoon of 7 October 1978 at The Black Cap gay pub in Camden, where his act involved miming the words to Barbra Streisand&#x27;s &quot;Nobody Makes a Pass at Me&quot; from the show &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;. Following a holiday to Poland, he visited an ex-boyfriend in Manila in the Philippines, there working briefly as a barman and waiter at a brothel.

Returning to London, O&#x27;Grady moved to Purley and then Streatham with a drag act, the Glamazons. With one of them, nicknamed &quot;Hush&quot;, he founded a two-man drag mime act, the Playgirls, although found little work in London. Agreeing to a tour of northern England, they moved to Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, also accepting a month&#x27;s work at a club in Copenhagen, Denmark. Diversifying their act, O&#x27;Grady learned fire eating and developed a striptease while wearing a fat suit he named &quot;Biddy&quot;. After Hush returned to London, O&#x27;Grady continued his drag performance as a solo act under the name of &quot;Paul Monroe&quot;, a reference to Marilyn Monroe. Under financial strain, O&#x27;Grady moved back in with his mother in Birkenhead. Amid mass unemployment, O&#x27;Grady briefly lived off the dole before resurrecting the Playgirls with his friend Vera; initially performing in Liverpool, where they were caught up in the 1981 Toxteth riots, they began touring other parts of northern England until returning to London.

Again working as a support worker for Camden Council Social Services, O&#x27;Grady lived in Vauxhall and then Brixton before reviving the Playgirls with Hush, devising an act based upon the film &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; At the end of the year, he appeared as an Ugly Sister in a drag pantomime of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In March 1983 he joined the Equity union, allowing him to take a role in the theatrical adaptation of &quot;If They&#x27;d Asked for a Lion Tamer&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse. The Playgirls gained bookings to appear across London, and also in Amsterdam and Copenhagen; O&#x27;Grady and Hush joined with drag artist David Dale to form an act known as &quot;LSD&quot;, which stood for &quot;Lily, Sandra, and Doris&quot;. Devising an act that parodied children&#x27;s television show &quot;Andy Pandy&quot;, they gained bookings across London and in Edinburgh.

=== 1984–1992: Residency in Vauxhall ===

In 1984, O&#x27;Grady began work as a barman at a Vauxhall gay pub, the Elephant and Castle. As Lily, he compered &quot;Ladies Night&quot; each Tuesday, where amateur drag acts would perform. As compere, he tried out comedy routines, becoming known for insulting both the acts and the audience; he attracted growing crowds and he was interviewed by artist Patrick Procktor. After six months, he transferred his act to the nearby Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT) gay pub, re-opening his show on Thursday nights as &quot;Stars of the Future&quot;. In 1985 he obtained his own council flat in Vauxhall&#x27;s Victoria Mansions. During the mid-1980s, he entered a relationship with Brendan &quot;Murph&quot; Murphy, the manager of a gay sauna near the Oval, Kennington. Murphy subsequently became O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s manager.

Eventually appearing at the RVT three times a week, on Sundays O&#x27;Grady began performing at the Union Tavern in Camberwell and the Goldsmiths Tavern in New Cross, where he often preceded Vic Reeves&#x27; three-hour show &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;. Quitting his council work, he focused full-time on his career as Lily, taking his act across the country and abroad. Other venues he performed at included the Madame Jojo&#x27;s club in Soho, the Bloomsbury Theatre, and the Heaven nightclub. Befriending American drag queen Divine and his manager Bernard Jay, Jay booked O&#x27;Grady to appear in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As Divine had done, O&#x27;Grady also recorded his own Hi-NRG song, &quot;Tough at the Top&quot;, which was produced by DJ Ian Levine. In 1988, he performed as Madame in &quot;The Scythe of Reason&quot;, and appeared at the Glasgow Mayfest, where he developed a lifelong friendship with actor Ian McKellen.

O&#x27;Grady used his act to speak out on issues affecting the gay community, especially during the HIV/AIDS crisis. In April 1988 he took part in a march against Section 28, a policy introduced by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government that many denounced as homophobic. Regularly doing charity fundraisers for HIV/AIDS research, many of his friends died from AIDS-related complications; he later related that &quot;People my age will never get over the horrors.&quot; He performed in a play about the disease at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in Islington, befriending co-star Amanda Mealing.

From 1989 to 1992 O&#x27;Grady performed annually as Lily at the Edinburgh Fringe, gaining increasing recognition. He was nominated for the 1991 Perrier Award alongside Jack Dee, Eddie Izzard, and (the ultimate winner) Frank Skinner. He later related that &quot;The Edinburgh Festival changed my life. The experience opened doors for me that would otherwise have been firmly closed, exposing me to a much wider audience than I&#x27;d previously been used to.&quot; O&#x27;Grady followed this with a show titled &quot;Lily Savage Live from the Hackney Empire&quot;; a sell-out, it was the first time that his performance was recorded. In 1992 he embarked on an Australian tour, performing alongside the Australian comedian Mark Trevorrow, and proceeded to Los Angeles, where he was present for the 1992 riots in that city.

O&#x27;Grady obtained his breakthrough into television when he played the character of a
transvestite prostitute informant, Roxanne, in three episodes of ITV&#x27;s police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; between 1988 and 1990. Just before filming on the first episode, O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s mother died. In 1990 he appeared in the ITV miniseries &quot;Chimera&quot; as a social worker; during filming he befriended co-star Liza Tarbuck. He followed this with a performance as a Marlene Dietrich-style cabaret singer in an episode of Rik Mayall&#x27;s ITV comedy &quot;The New Statesman&quot;. He had continued to perform regularly at the RVT, and after the proprietors Pat and Breda McConnor decided to move on, he and Murphy unsuccessfully sought to replace them. O&#x27;Grady never compered at the RVT again after the McConnors left.

=== 1992–1998: Mainstream success ===
After leaving the RVT, O&#x27;Grady continued to tour as Lily and released VHS videos of his performances. Gaining further public exposure through an appearance on the late-night Channel 4 comedy show &quot;Viva Cabaret!&quot;, he appeared on an episode of BBC quiz show &quot;That&#x27;s Showbusiness&quot;. Moving into radio, he began making regular appearances as Lily on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; and &quot;Loose Ends&quot;. Also moving into film, he travelled to Dublin, Ireland to play an inmate in the 1993 film &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;; although not in the Lily character, he was credited as &quot;Paul Savage&quot;. In character as Lily, he appeared on an October 1994 episode of BBC series &quot;The Steve Wright People Show&quot;, had a cameo in the soap &quot;Brookside&quot; the following month, and presented an episode of BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. He also appeared as a female pirate in an episode of BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Pirates&quot;.

Employed to narrate the BBC 2 series &quot;Life Swaps&quot;, he was also given his own late-night Channel 4 series, &quot;Live from the Lilydrome&quot;, which was filmed in a working men&#x27;s club in Blackpool. Given top billing at the gay rights charity Stonewall&#x27;s 1994 Equality Show in Albert Hall, he also played the role of Nancy in the London Palladium&#x27;s performance of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot;. Reflecting his increasing success in mainstream British comedy, in 1994 he was nominated for both Top Live Stand-Up Comedian and Top Television Comedy Newcomer at the British Comedy Awards. Some in the South London gay scene were critical of O&#x27;Grady, accusing him of being a sell out; he fiercely denied these accusations, stating that &quot;I&#x27;ve done nearly ten years on the factory floor and now I feel I deserve a shot in the office.&quot;

After Paula Yates resigned as presenter of the Channel 4 morning television program &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, its production company Planet 24 employed O&#x27;Grady to replace her. A four-week &quot;Lie-in with Lily&quot; was commissioned as a trial run. As Lily, O&#x27;Grady ignored the suggested questions of PR agents and instead asked personal questions of his guests; having attracted 2 million viewers, Planet 24 renewed his contract to keep him on as presenter. Through contacts made in showbusiness, he befriended many A-list celebrities, among them Elton John and Cher. O&#x27;Grady found the early morning starts difficult, particularly as he was also appearing as Lily in a musical version of &quot;Prisoner Cell Block H&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. When the musical then toured the UK, O&#x27;Grady took a break from &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; to accompany it.

He took his new dog, a shih tzu-bichon frisé cross named Buster, with him on tour; O&#x27;Grady later commented that &quot;He was never happier than in a TV studio or theatre... Buster knew all the theatre doormen and loved being fussed over. He was a smashing dog.&quot; At the time, O&#x27;Grady had been making greater attempts to get to know his teenage daughter; the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; tabloid treated her existence as a headline scandal in autumn 1994. Critical of the media, O&#x27;Grady condemned them for solely referring to him as a drag queen; he commented that Barry Humphries, who played the character of Dame Edna Everage, was &quot;never called a drag act because he&#x27;s a heterosexual male. But I&#x27;m called one because I&#x27;m a gay man. It&#x27;s homophobic and it&#x27;s wrong as there is nothing remotely sexual about what I do. I dress up as a woman for financial purposes, nothing else.&quot;

In April 1996, O&#x27;Grady filmed a performance at the LWT Tower as &quot;An Evening with Lily Savage&quot;, broadcast on ITV in November. A hit, it was awarded Best Entertainment Program at the 1997 National Television Awards. He turned down ITV&#x27;s subsequent offer of a weekly show because it would air before the watershed and thus force him to drastically alter his act into a form of light entertainment. With Murphy he then established a production company, Wildflower. Returning to theatre, he performed &quot;The Lily Savage Show&quot; for a 16-week sell-out run at Blackpool&#x27;s North Pier Theatre and then &quot;Lily&#x27;s Christmas Cracker&quot; at the Blackpool Opera House, the latter filmed for broadcast by the BBC. At this juncture, he agreed to appear as Lily in adverts for the Ford Escort, subsequently appearing in ad campaigns for Pretty Polly tights, the soft drink Oasis, and a bingo company. Earnings from these performances allowed him to move out of his Vauxhall council flat and into a house near Tower Bridge in South London. He also purchased a flat in Saltaire.

==Television==

=== 1998–2003: &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, travel shows, and &quot;Eyes Down&quot; ===
In 1998, the BBC produced a six-week Sunday series titled &quot;The Lily Savage Show&quot;, during which he interviewed guests like Elton John, Alan Yentob, and Anthea Turner. O&#x27;Grady found the scripted, non-spontaneous nature of the series difficult, and it was not well received. As Lily, O&#x27;Grady was invited on to other television chat shows, such as &quot;Richard and Judy&quot;; he appeared in a Christmas special of cookery show &quot;Ready, Steady, Cook&quot;. He went on an eight-week tour as Lily, before starring as Miss Hannigan in a West End revival of the musical &quot;Annie&quot;. He subsequently accompanied the show&#x27;s tour of the UK, before appearing in pantomime in Birmingham.

The BBC decided to revive the quiz show &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, previously hosted by Terry Wogan and Les Dawson. They selected O&#x27;Grady to present the show as Lily, allowing him to ad lib rather than follow a script. Screened on primetime Saturday night, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; proved a ratings winner, attracting an audience of 9 million. ITV then purchased it, offering O&#x27;Grady a two-year deal for £1 million. ITV let him be more risque in his use of humour on &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, and also commissioned a new comedy series, &quot;Lily Live!&quot;. This show also proved a success, earning O&#x27;Grady nominations for both the Best Comedy Entertainment Personality and Programme at the 2000 British Comedy Awards. With increased earnings—his assets were estimated to total £4 million—in 1999 O&#x27;Grady purchased a house in Aldington, Kent from comedian Vic Reeves, decorating it in an art nouveau style and establishing a smallholding.

Tired of appearing as Lily, O&#x27;Grady decided to try to make a career for himself outside of drag. He appeared as himself in an advert campaign for Double Two shirt-makers, before pitching a six-part travelogue series to ITV, who agreed to part-fund it. The project resulted in &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Orient&quot;, for which he travelled throughout East and Southeast Asia. Although poorly received by the tabloid press, it achieved good ratings, and ITV commissioned a second series, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s America&quot;, in which he visited various U.S. cities. Again it received poor tabloid reviews. O&#x27;Grady suffered a bout of clinical depression, but recovered in time to perform alongside Cilla Black and Barbara Windsor in a burlesque rendition of &quot;You Gotta Get a Gimmick&quot; at the 2001 Royal Variety Performance; the televised event attracted 11.5 million viewers.

In April 2002, O&#x27;Grady had a heart attack, which doctors attributed to a combination of a congenital family heart problems with stress, heavy smoking, and caffeine. His recovery meant missing the Heritage Foundation Awards ceremony, where he was awarded television personality of the year award. Returning to work, he appeared as the Child Catcher in a twelve-week run of the musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the London Palladium, receiving good reviews. He followed this with a Christmas season as the Wicked Queen in the pantomime &quot;Snow White&quot; at Manchester Opera House.

In 2003, O&#x27;Grady appeared in &quot;Celebrity Driving School&quot;, a BBC Comic Relief show in which he learned to drive, alongside Nadia Sawalha and Jade Goody. One of his tantrums on the shows was nominated for a Best Television Moment of the Year Award. Although turning down most offers to appear in a sitcom, he agreed to play the manager of a Merseyside bingo hall in the BBC series &quot;Eyes Down&quot;, commenting: &quot;He&#x27;s an evil, twisted man who hates everything that moves. Not exactly a challenge for me&quot;. Screened in the prime Friday night slot, the show was popular with viewers, if not reviewers, and was renewed for a second series in 2004. The BBC were also planning on reviving &quot;The Generation Game&quot;; O&#x27;Grady presented two pilot episodes in late 2003 but left the project, unhappy with the result. O&#x27;Grady ended 2003 in pantomime at the Bristol Hippodrome.

=== 2004–2011: &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; and &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot; ===


O&#x27;Grady temporarily stood in for Des O&#x27;Connor on ITV&#x27;s lunchtime chat show &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot;, enjoying the feeling of presenting live. ITV executives then offered him his own daytime chat show: &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. There was initial press concern that O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s style of adult humour would not be appropriate for a daytime slot, but ITV&#x27;s controller of entertainment, Mark Wells, declared that &quot;Paul is one of the funniest people on television – he deserves to be on it far more than he is.&quot;

The show first aired in October 2004 from 5 pm to 6 pm and saw O&#x27;Grady interviewing celebrity guests; it represented &quot;a glorious mix of seemingly unscripted banter, chat and slapstick humour&quot;. In producing the show, O&#x27;Grady worked with many old friends, including warm-up man Andy Collins. The series was a hit, attaining between 2.5 and 2.7 million viewers daily. According to O&#x27;Grady biographer Neil Simpson, the series was &quot;a riotous, endearingly kitsch romp with no pretensions to be anything other than pure entertainment. In some ways it was pure vaudeville[...] There were novelty acts, talking dogs, whistling goldfish, extraordinary stories. His audience laughed like drains at his anecdotes and were brought right into the heart of the show.&quot; The inclusion of his dog, Buster, on the show proved particularly popular with audiences. The show gained a devoted following, with many fans attending the screenings; often, as many as a hundred had to be turned away. Describing those attending the screenings, Simpson noted that &quot;Groups of middle aged women dominate—but they are joined by beautiful twenty-something women with flawless make-up, flash City boys with Louis Vuitton briefcases, hip-looking students out for a good time and pensioners just wanting a laugh in the afternoon.&quot;

The show&#x27;s viewing figures exceeded those of Channel 4&#x27;s daytime chat show, &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;. Tabloids stoked the rivalry between the shows, calling it the &quot;Chat Wars&quot;. O&#x27;Grady claimed that tabloids had been publishing false quotations attributed to him, describing Richard and Judy as &quot;a lovely couple and we certainly haven&#x27;t fallen out.&quot; At Christmas 2004, O&#x27;Grady starred in a pantomime, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. After the second series of &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; was commissioned, in March 2005 it was awarded Best Daytime Programme by the Royal Television Society, and O&#x27;Grady was subsequently awarded Best Entertainment Performance at the BAFTAs. In August controversy arose after it was revealed that the staff member responsible for interviewing the show&#x27;s prospective child reporters had written derogatory notes about them; O&#x27;Grady dismissed the staff member responsible and issued a public apology.

In June 2005, Murphy died of brain cancer. Prior to Murphy&#x27;s death, O&#x27;Grady had promised him that his production company—now named Olga TV after one of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s dogs—would take creative control over &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. ITV refused to allow this, and so O&#x27;Grady moved the show to Channel 4, where it was renamed &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. Press accused O&#x27;Grady of moving in pursuit of a higher salary; Channel 4 offered him a contract for £2 million a year, making him one of Britain&#x27;s highest-paid television stars.

In June 2006, O&#x27;Grady suffered a second massive heart attack, undergoing an angioplasty; he received around 7000 get-well-soon cards and letters from fans. He returned to work for the second series of &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; in September, during which the show&#x27;s viewing figures hit a new peak. To deal with his health issues, he began taking a week off mid-series, where he was replaced by guest presenters. O&#x27;Grady subsequently won the Ten Years at the Top award at the TV Quick and TV Choice awards.

The tabloids tried to re-ignite the &quot;chat wars&quot; by claiming a rivalry between O&#x27;Grady and other daytime television shows such as &quot;The Sharon Osbourne Show&quot; and &quot;The Brian Conley Show&quot;. Amid the later News International phone hacking scandal, police from Operation Weeting informed him that &quot;News of the World&quot; reporter Glenn Mulcaire had hacked his mobile phone. He decided not to sue. 2006 also saw the start of his relationship with future-husband André Portasio, a ballet dancer.
In 2008, O&#x27;Grady had a cameo as himself in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, and appeared in &quot;Ghosthunting with Paul O&#x27;Grady and Friends&quot;, filmed in Palermo, Sicily. 2008 also saw publication of the first volume of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;At My Mother&#x27;s Knee ... And Other Low Joints&quot;, published by Bantam. The second volume, &quot;The Devil Rides Out: The Second Coming&quot;, followed in 2010.

After budget talks broke down with Channel 4, O&#x27;Grady ended &quot;The New Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. In October 2009, O&#x27;Grady agreed to an £8 million deal with ITV to host a Friday prime-time chat-show, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot;. The first series aired from September to November 2010. In October, O&#x27;Grady attracted media attention after calling the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government &quot;bastards&quot; on his show for mass cuts to social services. He also voiced his support for student protesters who had occupied and vandalised the Conservative Party headquarters. Ofcom received several complaints over the incident. &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot; was picked up for a second series from April to July 2011, and included a special devoted to American pop star Lady Gaga. In October, ITV axed &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady Live&quot;. O&#x27;Grady stated that ITV had asked him to return for a third series, but that he had refused, claiming that he had had enough of the chat show format, and that he was fed up with the &quot;interference&quot; from the show&#x27;s producers.
That month, he also performed in &quot;Drama at Inish&quot; at the Finborough Theatre in Earl&#x27;s Court.

=== 2012–2023: Animal shows, &quot;Blind Date&quot;, and final works ===

2012 saw the launch of ITV documentary series &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady: For the Love of Dogs&quot;, covering life at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in south London. O&#x27;Grady commented that he had wanted to do such a show for years and that he took to it with an &quot;enthusiasm that surprised everyone except me&quot;. Although scheduled to initially film at the centre for six days, he stayed as a volunteer for six months. At the end of the first series, O&#x27;Grady was invited to become an ambassador for the centre, and a bronze statue of his late dog, Buster, was erected on a plinth at the centre. He also adopted a dog from the home; a Jack Russell–Chihuahua cross named Eddy. Through the series he developed a friendship with actor Tom Hardy, who appeared in one episode.

In April 2012, O&#x27;Grady appeared on &quot;The One and Only Des O&#x27;Connor&quot;, a one-off special for ITV which looked back on the life of Des O&#x27;Connor. In October 2012, the third volume of his memoirs, &quot;Still Standing: The Savage Years&quot;, was released.
In 2012, O&#x27;Grady also revived his Lily Savage character for a cameo in &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Little Cracker&quot;, a Christmas short story. He later expressed criticism of the show &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; and the contemporary drag performers on it, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s all about shading and contouring your face now and being like supermodels [...] This new brigade who just parade around going, sashay, shantay—that&#x27;s not drag to me&quot;, lacking the comedic element common to drag queens of his generation.

In July 2013, O&#x27;Grady narrated the ITV documentary &quot;Me and My Guide Dog&quot; following the work of Guide Dogs. In April 2013, O&#x27;Grady presented a documentary about burlesque performer Gypsy Rose Lee as part of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives&quot; series. That month, he also presented ITV&#x27;s &quot;British Animal Honours&quot; award ceremony.

In 2013, ITV revived &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. In November, O&#x27;Grady suffered an angina attack and underwent further heart surgery.

In 2013, O&#x27;Grady guest starred as cancer patient Tim Connor in three episodes of the BBC medical drama &quot;Holby City&quot;. On 31 October 2013, O&#x27;Grady recorded a non-broadcast pilot for a BBC One sitcom called &quot;Led Astray&quot;, starring alongside Cilla Black. The show was not commissioned for a full series due to the pair&#x27;s busy schedules. In 2013, O&#x27;Grady presented two-part BBC documentary series &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Working Britain&quot;, which was nominated for a National Television Award in January 2014. On 16 October 2013, O&#x27;Grady presented &quot;The One and Only Cilla Black&quot;, a 90-minute ITV special celebrating Cilla Black&#x27;s 50 years in show business. The show was later repeated shortly after Cilla Black&#x27;s death in August 2015, with O&#x27;Grady presenting a short tribute to her to introduce the show.

The first series of &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Animal Orphans&quot; screened in 2014, with O&#x27;Grady travelling to see wildlife in Africa; a second series followed in 2015 and a third in 2016. The first series averaged 3.29 million viewers while the second averaged 2.75 million. In 2014, he appeared in a &quot;Gogglebox&quot; special for Stand Up to Cancer. In December 2014, O&#x27;Grady appeared in ITV&#x27;s documentary &quot;Rita &amp; Me&quot; celebrating Barbara Knox&#x27;s fifty years as the character Rita Tanner in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

In September 2015, O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s fourth book &quot;Open the Cage, Murphy!: Further Savage Adventures&quot; was released. In 2015, O&#x27;Grady presented &quot;Bob Monkhouse: The Million Joke Man&quot;, a three-part factual series for Gold, exploring the life of comedian and presenter Bob Monkhouse.

That year, he also presented a Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s 100 Years of Movie Musicals&quot;, and another for ITV, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Favourite Fairy Tales&quot;. That same evening he appeared on ITV in &quot;Hilda Ogden&#x27;s Last Ta-ra&quot;, which was a tribute to the late &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Jean Alexander.

In August 2017, O&#x27;Grady married Portasio in a ceremony at London&#x27;s Goring Hotel, although the pair continued to live separately. That year also saw the screening of two-part ITV series &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady: For the Love of Animals – India&quot;, and the three-part Channel 4 series &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, as well as a Channel 5 documentary about his life, &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Story&quot;. It also saw the publication of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Country Life&quot;. In 2017, Channel 5 revived the game show &quot;Blind Date&quot; with O&#x27;Grady as its presenter. The first series was watched by an average of 1.5 million viewers. A Christmas episode aired on 23 December 2017, before the second series aired from 30 December 2017. A third series was filmed in February 2018.

In 2020, O&#x27;Grady presented the six-part ITV series &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Great British Escape&quot;, in which he visited sites across Kent. In September 2021, he began hosting &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Saturday Night Line-Up&quot;.

In May 2023, O&#x27;Grady appeared alongside Paul Hollywood, King Charles and Queen Camilla, Sister Sister and Ricky Tomlinson in a pre-recorded segment for the opening of the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2023, which was hosted in Liverpool. This was O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s final television work before his death.

A final series of &quot;For The Love of Dogs&quot; that O&#x27;Grady recorded in summer 2022 aired from April to September 2023 on ITV, and on 30 January 2024, it was announced that the show would continue with a new presenter, Alison Hammond. Plus, a new 2 part documentary series for ITV, &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s Great Elephant Adventure&quot;, that O&#x27;Grady also filmed in 2022, aired on 31 March and 7 April 2024.

==Radio==

In 2008 and 2009, O&#x27;Grady occasionally sat in for Elaine Paige on her BBC Radio 2 show &quot;Elaine Paige on Sunday&quot;. From April 2009, O&#x27;Grady presented his own two-hour long programme on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Paul O&#x27;Grady on the Wireless&quot; which was broadcast on Sundays from 5 pm to 7 pm.

O&#x27;Grady was a guest on Kate Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Paper Cuts&quot; in 2015. In September 2017, O&#x27;Grady presented a two-part documentary for BBC Radio 2 called &quot;The Story of the Light&quot;. The show saw O&#x27;Grady celebrate the 50th anniversary of Radio 2 by looking back at the BBC Light Programme that the channel replaced.

In August 2022, it was announced that O&#x27;Grady was resigning from BBC Radio 2 due to his unhappiness with having to share his slot with Rob Beckett. His final show aired that same month. On 21 November 2022, it was announced that O&#x27;Grady would join Boom Radio to present a show on Christmas Day, similar to the festive show he presented for Radio 2. Prior to his death, O&#x27;Grady had been due to present another special show on Easter Sunday before joining the station permanently in May 2023.

== Charity work ==
O&#x27;Grady supported philanthropic causes for carers. From 2008 onwards, he was an ambassador for Save the Children.

In 2012, O&#x27;Grady became an ambassador for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home following his series &quot;For the Love of Dogs&quot;, which was filmed in the home. In 2013, he took part in the Pedigree Feeding Brighter Futures campaign with Amanda Holden, which aimed to give a million meals to rescue dogs nationwide.

In 2014, O&#x27;Grady co-starred in a Dementia Friends TV advertisement campaign to raise awareness about the disease.

In October 2015, following his work on &quot;Animal Orphans&quot;, O&#x27;Grady became a patron of Orangutan Appeal UK.

In September 2016, O&#x27;Grady was recognised for his work with animals when he won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Animal Welfare at the RSPCA&#x27;s Animal Hero Awards.
As an unofficial ambassador for the county of Kent (where he lived for 20 years) and which he readily promoted (including an ITV series) he accepted the unpaid position of Deputy Lieutenant of Kent in 2022.

==Personal life==
In 1974, with his friend Diane Jansen, O&#x27;Grady had a daughter. From 1977 to 2005, he was in a marriage of convenience with a Portuguese woman, Teresa Fernandes, although he was not in an active relationship with her.

His long-term lover and business partner was Brendan Frank Murphy (b. 4 March 1956; d. 9 June 2005). In the fourth volume of his biography, he noted that he has &quot;always had a penchant for the bad boys&quot;. In 2017 he married André Portasio.

Known to many friends as &quot;Lily&quot; or &quot;Lil&quot;, O&#x27;Grady was known for having had many high-profile and celebrity friends, including politician Mo Mowlam, actresses Amanda Mealing and Barbara Windsor, comedian Brenda Gilhooly and singer and television presenter Cilla Black.

O&#x27;Grady divided his time between his Central London flat and his rural Kentish farmhouse, where he grew organic fruit and vegetables and a variety of herbs, having a keen interest in herbal medicine. A lifelong animal lover, as a child O&#x27;Grady kept rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, a ferret and a rat as pets; he commented that his mother thought him &quot;a bit weird&quot; as a result. At his farm, he owned sheep, pigs, goats, donkeys, ducks, chickens, geese, ferrets, bats, mice and dogs.

Two of O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s pet dogs became well known to the British public through appearances on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;. The first was a rescue dog, Buster Elvis Savage, a Shih Tzu/Bichon Frisé cross. Buster was euthanised in November 2009 as a result of his cancer. O&#x27;Grady dedicated the second volume of his autobiography to Buster, describing him as &quot;The greatest canine star since Lassie&quot;. A second dog, the Cairn Terrier Olga, also attracted attention. In 2013, it was revealed that she was undergoing chemotherapy due to cancer. Olga was euthanised in April 2018 after suffering from kidney failure.

In an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2006, O&#x27;Grady admitted that smoking forty cigarettes a day for several decades had contributed to his two heart attacks.

In 2013, O&#x27;Grady expressed his support for the Labour Party, championing Labour leader Ed Miliband as a better candidate for UK Prime Minister than Conservative incumbent David Cameron. He lambasted the Cameron–Clegg coalition government then in power, describing them as &quot;absolutely disgusting. They have no idea what the common working man and woman are doing. They are not in touch with the working-classes. They have led privileged lives – they&#x27;ve had public schools and have never been on the shop floor.&quot; He also praised Miliband&#x27;s successor, Jeremy Corbyn.

In 2015, he told a reporter that despite his wealth, he still felt &quot;very much&quot; working-class; &quot;I know that probably sounds strange. Mentally, I still am. I&#x27;m still thinking, have I got the rent for Friday?&quot; Raised as a Roman Catholic, in his autobiography he related having &quot;grown out of Catholicism&quot; after his mother&#x27;s death, but had &quot;always been interested in alternative religions&quot;, citing a particular interest in Wicca. He also reported seeing unexplained lights over his Kent home, considering the possibility that he was being observed by extraterrestrials.

==Death==
O&#x27;Grady died at his home in Kent on 28 March 2023, aged 67, from sudden cardiac arrhythmia. He had previously had three heart attacks, in 2002, 2006 and 2014. His death was announced by his husband, André Portasio, and tributes poured in from global figures and celebrities, including from Queen Camilla, television presenter Lorraine Kelly and LGBT rights campaigner Peter Tatchell. O&#x27;Grady has been hailed by many as a national treasure.

O&#x27;Grady&#x27;s final performance was as Miss Hannigan in &quot;Annie&quot; at the Edinburgh Playhouse just days before his death. His funeral was held at the Church of St Rumwold, Bonnington, Kent, on 20 April 2023; after the service he was buried there, next to his late partner Brendan Murphy.

=== Other ===
In September 2016, O&#x27;Grady was recognised for his work with animals when he won the award for Outstanding Contribution to Animal Welfare at the RSPCA&#x27;s Animal Hero Awards.

In October 2023, Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home announced that they would be naming a new veterinary hospital after O&#x27;Grady, and a &quot;tribute fund&quot; set up in his honour would go towards &quot;life-saving and transformative medical procedures&quot; for dogs and cats which need specialist care and treatment.

<text>Dame Cleo Laine, Lady Dankworth (born Clementine Dinah Hitching; 28 October 1927) is an English singer and actress known for her scat singing. She is the widow of jazz composer and musician Sir John Dankworth and the mother of bassist Alec Dankworth and singer Jacqui Dankworth.

==Early life==
Laine was born Clementine Dinah Hitching on 28 October 1927, in Southall, Middlesex (now London), to Alexander Sylvan Campbell, a Jamaican who worked as a building labourer and regularly busked, and Minnie Bullock, an English farmer&#x27;s daughter from Swindon, Wiltshire, whose maiden name was reportedly Hitching. 

The family moved constantly, but most of Laine&#x27;s childhood was spent in Southall. It was not until 1953, when she was 26 and applying for a passport for a forthcoming tour of Germany, that Laine found out her real birth name, owing to her parents not being married at the time and her mother registering her under her own name (Hitching).

==Education==
Laine attended the Board School on Featherstone Road, Southall (later known as Featherstone Primary School), and was sent by her mother for singing and dancing lessons at an early age. She went on to attend Mellow Lane Senior School in Hayes before going to work as an apprentice hairdresser, a hat-trimmer, a librarian, and in a pawnbroker&#x27;s shop.

==Career==

Laine auditioned successfully at the age of 24 for John Dankworth&#x27;s small group, the Johnny Dankworth Seven. Laine later played with his big bands, Johnny Dankworth &amp; His Orchestra as well as Johnny Dankworth &amp; His New Radio Orchestra, with which she performed until 1958. Dankworth and Laine married that year. She played the lead in Barry Reckord&#x27;s &quot;Flesh to a Tiger&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre, home of the new wave of playwrights of the 1950s such as John Osborne and Harold Pinter. The same year, she played the title role in &quot;The Barren One,&quot; Sylvia Wynter&#x27;s adaptation of Federico García Lorca&#x27;s &quot;Yerma.&quot; This led to other stage performances, such as the musical &quot;Valmouth&quot; in 1959, the play &quot;A Time to Laugh&quot; (with Robert Morley and Ruth Gordon) in 1962, &quot;Boots With Strawberry Jam&quot; (with John Neville) in 1968, and eventually to her role as Julie in Wendy Toye&#x27;s production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre in London in 1971. &quot;Show Boat&quot; had its longest run to date in that London season with 910 performances staged.

During this period, she had two major recording successes. &quot;You&#x27;ll Answer to Me&quot; reached the British Top 10 while Laine was &quot;prima donna&quot; in the 1961 Edinburgh Festival production of Kurt Weill&#x27;s opera/ballet &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins&quot;, directed and choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan. In 1964, her &quot;Shakespeare and All that Jazz&quot; album with Dankworth was well received. Dankworth and Laine founded the Stables theatre in 1970, in what was the old stables block in the grounds of their home. It eventually hosted over 350 concerts per year.

Laine&#x27;s international activities began in 1972, with a successful first tour of Australia, where she released six top-100 albums throughout the 1970s. Shortly afterwards, her career in the United States was launched with a concert at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center, followed in 1973 by the first of many Carnegie Hall appearances. Coast-to-coast tours of the US and Canada soon followed, and with them a succession of record albums and television appearances, including &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1977. This led, after several nominations, to her first Grammy award, in recognition of the live recording of her 1983 Carnegie concert. She kept touring into the 21st century, including in Australia in 2005. She performed live in the UK as late as 2018.

She has collaborated with James Galway, Nigel Kennedy, Julian Lloyd Webber and John Williams. Other important recordings during that time were duet albums with Ray Charles (&quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;) as well as Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;, for which she received a Grammy Award nomination.

Laine&#x27;s relationship with the musical theatre started in Britain and continued in the United States with starring performances in Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; and Franz Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (Michigan Opera). In 1980 she starred in &quot;Colette&quot;, a musical by Dankworth. The show began at the Stables theatre, Wavendon, in 1979 and transferred to the Comedy Theatre, London, in September 1980. In 1985 she originated the role of Princess Puffer in the Broadway musical &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;, for which she received a Tony nomination. In 1989, she received the Los Angeles critics&#x27; acclaim for her portrayal of the Witch in Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. In May 1992, Laine appeared with Frank Sinatra for a week of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
Derek Jewel of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; dubbed her &quot;quite simply the best singer in the world.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1946, Laine married George Langridge, a roof tiler, with whom she had a son, Stuart. The couple divorced in 1957. 

In 1958, she married John Dankworth. They were married until his death in 2010. On that day, Laine performed at a concert at The Stables to mark the venue&#x27;s 40th anniversary. She then announced Dankworth&#x27;s death at the end of the show.

, Laine resides in Wavendon, Buckinghamshire.

<text>Russell W. &quot;Russ&quot; Howard, CM, ONL (born February 19, 1956, in Midland, Ontario) is a Canadian curler and Olympic champion, based in Regina, Saskatchewan, but originally from Midland, Ontario. He lived in Moncton, New Brunswick, from 2000 to 2019. Known for his gravelly voice, Howard has been to the Brier 14 times (8 as Ontario, 6 as New Brunswick), winning the title twice (both as Ontario). He is also a two-time world champion, winning in 1987 and 1993. He has also won three TSN Skins Games in 1991, 1992, and 1993, and participated in two Canadian Mixed Curling Championships in 2000 and 2001. He won gold at the 2006 Winter Olympics. He played in two Canadian Senior Curling Championships in 2008 and 2009 finishing with a silver medal both of those years. Russ Howard was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. He is currently a curling analyst and commentator for TSN’s Season of Champions curling coverage.

==Career==
In 2005, he joined team Gushue to call the shots for Brad Gushue&#x27;s team at the Canadian Olympic Trials, while he played second. Howard, along with Gushue (who throws last rocks), lead Jamie Korab and third Mark Nichols, went on to win the trials, giving them the right to represent Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where they won the gold medal, defeating Finland 10–4 in the final match. It was the first time that a Canadian team had won the gold medal for men&#x27;s curling. Howard, who turned 50 during the Olympics, is also the oldest Canadian to win an Olympic gold medal. The oldest person ever to win a gold medal was Robin Welsh, aged 54, who won gold in curling at the 1924 Winter Olympics.

As a skip (captain), Howard has been in three previous trials (in 1987, 1997, and 2001), but never went on to the Olympics. Howard is also the innovator of the &quot;Moncton Rule&quot;, which evolved into the &quot;free guard zone&quot;, part of international and Olympic rules. This makes his 2006 medal particularly significant, as it is likely that without the excitement this rule adds to the sport it would not have become an Olympic event in the 1990s.

In the 2009-10 curling season, although he played in bonspiels throughout the year, Howard did not curl in the New Brunswick Tankard due to his broadcasting commitments with The Sports Network (TSN). Howard has been commentating curling events for TSN since 2001.

In 2006, he was inducted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame. In 2013, he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada and inducted into the WCF Hall of Fame in 2015.

===Brier records===
At the end of the 2009 Brier, Howard had appeared in more Briers than any other player (14), and played more games at the Brier than any other player (174). The 2012 Brier saw his brother Glenn Howard tying his record for Brier appearances and breaking his record for most career games played at the Brier. As of 2017, Russ had appeared in the second most Brier games ever, behind his brother Glenn.

===Broadcasting career===
Howard stepped into the broadcast booth for the first time in 2001, serving as an analyst for TSN’s coverage of the Brier. Since 2008, he has been a mainstay analyst on the network, also providing colour commentary for TSN’s Season of Champions curling.

Howard handled colour commentating duties for Canada’s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium during the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.

==Personal life==
Howard&#x27;s grand-aunt, Jean Thompson, was an Olympic runner. His brother, Glenn Howard, is also a well known curler. Howard&#x27;s daughter, Ashley Howard, is a competitive curler and the executive director of CurlSask, the governing body of curling in Saskatchewan.

Outside of curling, Howard worked as a real estate agent for Royal LePage Atlantic, in addition to his commentator work with TSN, and as a curling coach in Switzerland. He moved to Regina, Saskatchewan in 2019 to be closer to his children.

==Teams==
==Publications==
Howard has released two books: &quot;Hurry Hard: The Russ Howard Story&quot; (2007), an autobiography that vividly describes his journey to becoming an Olympic gold medallist, and &quot;Curl to Win&quot; (2008).

<doc id="514458" wikidata="Q1509074" url="?curid=514458" title="Wound healing">
<text>Wound healing refers to a living organism&#x27;s replacement of destroyed or damaged tissue by newly produced tissue.

In undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface, epithelial layer) and dermis (deeper, connective layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage. This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (cell proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation and cell differentiation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage. 

The wound-healing process is not only complex but fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing chronic wounds. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.

Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient&#x27;s needs, it can range from the simplest first aid to entire nursing specialties such as wound, ostomy, and continence nursing and burn center care.

==Stages==
* Hemostasis (blood clotting): Within the first few minutes of injury, platelets in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of fibrin, which forms a mesh and acts as &quot;glue&quot; to bind platelets to each other. This makes a clot that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.
* Inflammation: During this phase, damaged and dead cells are cleared out, along with bacteria and other pathogens or debris. This happens through the process of phagocytosis, where white blood cells engulf debris and destroy it. Platelet-derived growth factors are released into the wound that cause the migration and division of cells during the proliferative phase.
* Proliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, granulation tissue formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur. In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form new blood vessels. In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, fibroblasts grow and form a new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM) by excreting collagen and fibronectin. Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which epithelial cells proliferate and &#x27;crawl&#x27; atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue. In wound contraction, myofibroblasts decrease the size of the wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting using a mechanism that resembles that in smooth muscle cells. When the cells&#x27; roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo apoptosis.
* Maturation (remodeling): During maturation and remodeling, collagen is realigned along tension lines, and cells that are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or apoptosis.

==Timing and re-epithelialization==
Timing is important to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound re-epithelialization can decide the outcome of the healing. If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.

==Early vs cellular phase==

Wound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the &quot;early phase&quot; and the &quot;cellular phase&quot;:

The early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural staging for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.

The cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer. Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:
# Macrophages and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days)
# Epithelial-mesenchymal interaction: re-epithelialization (phenotype change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2)
# Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14)
# Endothelial cells and angiogenesis (begins on day 4)
# Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size).

== Inflammatory phase ==
Just before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the clotting cascade occurs in order to achieve hemostasis, or the stopping of blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract cells that phagocytise debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.

===Clotting cascade===
When tissue is first wounded, blood comes in contact with collagen, triggering blood platelets to begin secreting inflammatory factors. Platelets also express sticky glycoproteins on their cell membranes that allow them to aggregate, forming a mass.

Fibrin and fibronectin cross-link together and form a plug that traps proteins and particles and prevents further blood loss. This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited. Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors. The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with granulation tissue and then later with collagen.

Platelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including cytokines and growth factors. Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like serotonin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxane, and histamine, which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing blood vessels to become dilated and porous. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue macrophages and mast cells exposed to microbial molecular signatures in infection: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators – vasoactive amines, eicosanoids, and cytokines – that initiate the inflammatory process.

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
Immediately after a blood vessel is breached, ruptured cell membranes release inflammatory factors like thromboxanes and prostaglandins that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area. This vasoconstriction lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by vasodilation, a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding. Vasodilation is the result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is histamine. Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become edematous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area. Increased porosity of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like leukocytes into the wound site from the bloodstream.

===Polymorphonuclear neutrophils===
Within an hour of wounding, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day. They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as kinins. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing free radicals in what is called a respiratory burst. They also cleanse the wound by secreting proteases that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around two days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by macrophages.

Other leukocytes to enter the area include helper T cells, which secrete cytokines to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability. T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.

===Macrophages===
One of the roles of macrophages is to phagocytize other expended phagocytes, bacteria and damaged tissue, and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases.

Macrophages function in regeneration and are essential for wound healing. They are stimulated by the low oxygen content of their surroundings to produce factors that induce and speed angiogenesis and they also stimulate cells that reepithelialize the wound, create granulation tissue, and lay down a new extracellular matrix. By secreting these factors, macrophages contribute to pushing the wound healing process into the next phase. They replace PMNs as the predominant cells in the wound by two days after injury.

The spleen contains half the body&#x27;s monocytes in reserve ready to be deployed to injured tissue. Attracted to the wound site by growth factors released by platelets and other cells, monocytes from the bloodstream enter the area through blood vessel walls. Numbers of monocytes in the wound peak one to one and a half days after the injury occurs. Once they are in the wound site, monocytes mature into macrophages. Macrophages also secrete a number of factors such as growth factors and other cytokines, especially during the third and fourth post-wounding days. These factors attract cells involved in the proliferation stage of healing to the area.

In wound healing that result in incomplete repair, scar contraction occurs, bringing varying gradations of structural imperfections, deformities and problems with flexibility. Macrophages may restrain the contraction phase. Scientists have reported that removing the macrophages from a salamander resulted in failure of a typical regeneration response (limb regeneration), instead bringing on a repair (scarring) response.

=== Decline of inflammatory phase ===
As inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site. These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway. In vitro evidence, obtained using the dermal equivalent model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.

Because inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to tissue damage if it lasts too long. Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual&#x27;s immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial biofilm is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a chronic wound.

== Proliferative phase ==

About two or three days after the wound occurs, fibroblasts begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended. As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.

===Angiogenesis===

Also called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound. Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is erythematous) due to the presence of capillaries.

Angiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:
# Latent period: During the haemostatic and inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, vasodilation and permeabilisation allow leukocyte extravasation and phagocytic debridement and decontamination of the wound area. Tissue swelling aids later angiogenesis by expanding and loosening the existing collagenous extracellular matrix.
# Endothelial activation: As the wound macrophages switches from inflammatory to healing mode, it begins to secrete endothelial chemotactic and growth factors to attract adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells respond by retracting and reducing cell junctions, loosening themselves from their embedded endothelium. Characteristically the activated endothelial cells show enlarged nucleoli.
# Degradation of endothelial basement membrane: The wound macrophages, mast cells and the endothelial cells themselves secrete proteases to break down existing vascular basal lamina.
# Vascular sprouting: With the breakdown of endothelial basement membrane, detached endothelial cells from pre-existing capillaries and post-capillary venules can divide and migrate chemotactically towards the wound, laying down new vessels in the process. Vascular sprouting can be aided by ambient hypoxia and acidosis in the wound environment, as hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate angiogenic genes such as VEGF and GLUT1. Sprouted vessels can self-organise into luminal morphologies, and fusion of blind channels give rise to new capillary networks.
# Vascular maturation: the endothelium of vessels mature by laying down new endothelial extracellular matrix, followed by basal lamina formation. Lastly the vessel establishes a pericyte layer.

Stem cells of endothelial cells, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop pseudopodia and push through the ECM into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.

Endothelial cells are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin and chemotactically by angiogenic factors released by other cells, e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by hypoxia, and presence of lactic acid in the wound. For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate a set of proliferative genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1).

To migrate, endothelial cells need collagenases and plasminogen activator to degrade the clot and part of the ECM. Zinc-dependent metalloproteinases digest basement membrane and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.

When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors. Thus, when tissue is adequately perfused, migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by apoptosis.

===Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation===
Simultaneously with angiogenesis, fibroblasts begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding. By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound. Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.

As a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.

In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site. Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors). Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin. Fibroblasts then deposit ground substance into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.

Granulation tissue functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered. Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional extracellular matrix (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts. Such components include fibronectin, collagen, glycosaminoglycans, elastin, glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Its main components are fibronectin and hyaluronan, which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration. Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.

Growth factors (PDGF, TGF-β) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site. Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic scarring.

====Collagen deposition====
One of fibroblasts&#x27; most important duties is the production of collagen.

Collagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to traumatic injury. Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.

Type III collagen and fibronectin generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours and 3 days, depending mainly on wound size. Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks. They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger type I collagen.

Even as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain. This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done. At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.

===Epithelialization===
The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment. Basal keratinocytes from the wound edges and dermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous (oil) glands are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing. They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles and nerves do not form. With the lack of hair follicles, nerves and sweat glands, the wound, and the resulting healing scar, provide a challenge to the body with regards to temperature control.

Keratinocytes migrate without first proliferating. Migration can begin as early as a few hours after wounding. However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue. Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding. Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.

If the basement membrane is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the stratum basale in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin. However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the dermis that are lined with viable keratinocytes. If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.

Migration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of contact inhibition and by chemicals such as nitric oxide. Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, which normally anchor the cells by intermediate filaments in their cytoskeleton to other cells and to the ECM. Transmembrane receptor proteins called integrins, which are made of glycoproteins and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its cytoskeleton, are released from the cell&#x27;s intermediate filaments and relocate to actin filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for pseudopodia during migration. Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.

Before they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like lamellipodia and wide processes that look like ruffles. Actin filaments and pseudopodia form. During migration, integrins on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along. The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and filopodia.

Epithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate. This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue. The first cells to attach to the basement membrane form the stratum basale. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well. The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.

Fibrin, collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate. Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across.
As keratinocytes migrate, they move over granulation tissue but stay underneath the scab, thereby separating the scab from the underlying tissue. Epithelial cells have the ability to phagocytize debris such as dead tissue and bacterial matter that would otherwise obstruct their path. Because they must dissolve any scab that forms, keratinocyte migration is best enhanced by a moist environment, since a dry one leads to formation of a bigger, tougher scab. To make their way along the tissue, keratinocytes must dissolve the clot, debris, and parts of the ECM in order to get through. They secrete plasminogen activator, which activates plasminogen, turning it into plasmin to dissolve the scab. Cells can only migrate over living tissue, so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet. Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.

As keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet. Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues. Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.

Growth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges. Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing. Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes.

Keratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point contact inhibition causes them to stop migrating. When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane. Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and become anchored once again to the basement membrane. Basal cells begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.

===Contraction===

Contraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function. Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the collagen gel contraction assay or the dermal equivalent model.

Contraction commences approximately a week after wounding, when fibroblasts have differentiated into myofibroblasts. In full thickness wounds, contraction peaks at 5 to 15 days post wounding. Contraction can last for several weeks and continues even after the wound is completely reepithelialized. A large wound can become 40 to 80% smaller after contraction. Wounds can contract at a speed of up to 0.75 mm per day, depending on how loose the tissue in the wounded area is. Contraction usually does not occur symmetrically; rather most wounds have an &#x27;axis of contraction&#x27; which allows for greater organization and alignment of cells with collagen.

At first, contraction occurs without myofibroblast involvement. Later, fibroblasts, stimulated by growth factors, differentiate into myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction. Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in smooth muscle cells.

Myofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges. They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by desmosomes. Also, at an adhesion called the fibronexus, actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen. Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size. In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.

As the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together. Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract. The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis. The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating. These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.

== Maturation and remodeling ==
When the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun. During maturation, type III collagen, which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen. Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along tension lines. The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open, ranging from approximately three days to three weeks. The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.

As the phase progresses, the tensile strength of the wound increases. Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after three weeks, increasing to 80% after 12 months. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin. Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as blood vessels that are no longer needed are removed by apoptosis.

The phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a chronic wound such as a venous ulcer or pathological scarring such as a keloid scar.

==Factors affecting wound healing==
Many factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.

===Local factors===
* Moisture; keeping a wound moist rather than dry makes wound healing more rapid and with less pain and less scarring
* Mechanical factors
* Oedema
* Ionizing radiation
* Faulty technique of wound closure
* Ischemia and necrosis
* Foreign bodies. Sharp, small foreign bodies can penetrate the skin leaving little surface wound but causing internal injury and internal bleeding. For a glass foreign body, &quot;frequently, an innocent skin wound disguises the extensive nature of the injuries beneath&quot;. First-degree nerve injury requires a few hours to a few weeks to recover. If a foreign body passes by a nerve and causes first-degree nerve injury during entry, then the sensation of the foreign body or pain due to internal wounding may be delayed by a few hours to a few weeks after entry. A sudden increase in pain during the first few weeks of wound healing could be a sign of a recovered nerve reporting internal injuries rather than a newly developed infection.
* Low oxygen tension
* Perfusion

===Systemic factors===
* Inflammation
* Diabetes – Individuals with diabetes demonstrate reduced capability in the healing of acute wounds. Additionally, diabetic individuals are susceptible to developing chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes which affects 15% of people with diabetes and accounts for 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations. The impaired healing abilities of diabetics with diabetic foot ulcers and/or acute wounds involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms. This impaired healing involves hypoxia, fibroblast and epidermal cell dysfunction, impaired angiogenesis and neovascularization, high levels of metalloproteases, damage from reactive oxygen species and AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), decreased host immune resistance, and neuropathy.
* Nutrients – Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies have a recognizable impact on wound healing post trauma or surgical intervention. Nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, arginine, glutamine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron all play significant roles in wound healing. Fats and carbohydrates provide the majority of energy required for wound healing. Glucose is the most prominent source of fuel and it is used to create cellular ATP, providing energy for angiogenesis and the deposition of new tissues. As the nutritional needs of each patient and their associated wound are complex, it is suggested that tailored nutritional support would benefit both acute and chronic wound healing.
* Metabolic diseases
* Immunosuppression
* Connective tissue disorders
* Smoking – Smoking causes a delay in the speed of wound repair notably in the proliferative and inflammatory phases. It also increases the likelihood of certain complications such as wound rupture, wound and flap necrosis, decrease in wound tensile strength and infection. Passive smoking also impairs a proper wound healing process.
* Age – Increased age (over 60 years) is a risk factor for impaired wound healing. It is recognized that, in older adults of otherwise overall good health, the effects of aging causes a temporal delay in healing, but no major impairment with regard to the quality of healing. Delayed wound healing in patients of increasing age is associated with altered inflammatory response; for example delayed T-cell infiltration of the wound with alterations in the production of chemokines, and reduced macrophage phagocytic capacity.
* Alcohol – Alcohol consumption impairs wound healing and also increases the chances of infection. Alcohol affects the proliferative phase of healing. A single unit of alcohol causes a negative effect on re-epithelialization, wound closure, collagen production and angiogenesis.

In the 2000s there arose the first Mathematical models of the healing process, based on simplified assumptions and on a system of differential equations solved through MATLAB. The models show that the &quot;rate of the healing process&quot; appears to be &quot;highly influenced by the activity and size of the injury itself as well as the activity of the healing agent.&quot;

== Research and development ==
Up until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving stem cells restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of adult stem cells having cellular &quot;plasticity&quot; or the ability to differentiate into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation. To be more specific, hematopoietic progenitor cells (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability &quot;de-differentiate&quot; back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or &quot;transdifferentiate&quot; into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.

===Stem cells and cellular plasticity===
Multipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood. Stem cell injection leads to wound healing primarily through stimulation of angiogenesis.

It is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of rete ridges (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of hair follicles (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells). Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.

In rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair. These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and (2) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation (endothelial progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels. Moreover, it is thought that extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of leukocytes (circulating fibrocytes) to the injured region, where they perform various functions related to wound healing.

=== Wound repair versus regeneration ===
An injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration. Tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin. Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.

There is a subtle distinction between &#x27;repair&#x27; and &#x27;regeneration&#x27;. &quot;Repair&quot; means &quot;incomplete regeneration&quot;. Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue.
&quot;True tissue regeneration&quot; or &quot;complete regeneration&quot;, refers to the replacement of lost/damaged tissue with an &#x27;exact&#x27; copy, such that both morphology and functionality are completely restored. Though after injury mammals can completely regenerate spontaneously, they usually do not completely regenerate. An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the endometrium; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.

In some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable (collagen-glycoaminoglycan) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to extracellular matrix (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis. Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction. In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off myofibroblast differentiation.

A new way of thinking derived from the notion that heparan sulfates are key player in tissue homeostasis: the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. Heparan sulfate analogues cannot be degraded by all known heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.

Repair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury HIF-1a is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.

===Scarless wound healing===
&quot;Scarless wound healing&quot; is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively &quot;less&quot; scar tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of &quot;scar free healing,&quot; which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (&quot;free&quot; of scarring). However they are different concepts.

A reverse to scarless wound healing is scarification (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive; however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to plastic surgery clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on scar type, treatment may be invasive (intralesional steroid injections, surgery) and/or conservative (compression therapy, topical silicone gel, brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy). Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a placebo effect, and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.

Since the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in wound repair and tissue regeneration have expanded due to advances in cellular and molecular biology. Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring. However, the ultimate goal of wound healing biology is to induce a more perfect reconstruction of the wound area. Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues and complete regeneration is limited to lower vertebrates, such as salamanders, and invertebrates. In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by collagen deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation. Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.

The etymology of the term scarless wound healing has a long history. In print the antiquated concept of scarless healing was brought up in the early 20th century and appeared in a paper published in the London Lancet. This process involved cutting at a surgical slant to the skin surface, rather than at a right angle it; the process was described in various Newspapers.

===Cancer===
After inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system. An example of the importance of the wound healing response within tumors is illustrated in work by Howard Chang and colleagues at Stanford University studying breast cancers.

===Oral collagen supplements===
Preliminary results are promising for the short and long-term use of oral collagen supplements for wound healing and skin aging. Oral collagen supplements also increase skin elasticity, hydration, and dermal collagen density. Collagen supplementation is generally safe with no reported adverse events. Further studies are needed to elucidate medical use in skin barrier diseases such as atopic dermatitis and to determine optimal dosing regimens.

=== Wound dressings ===
Modern wound dressing to aid in wound repair has undergone considerable research and development in recent years. Scientists aim to develop wound dressings which have the following characteristics:
* Provide wound protection
* Remove excess exudate
* Possess antimicrobial properties
* Maintain a humid environment
* Have high permeability to oxygen
* Are easily removed from a wound site
* Possess non-anaphylactic characteristics

Cotton gauze dressings have been the standard of care, despite their dry properties that can adhere to wound surfaces and cause discomfort upon removal. Recent research has set out to improve cotton gauze dressings to bring them closer in line to achieve modern wound dressing properties, by coating cotton gauze wound dressing with a chitosan/Ag/ZnO nanocomposite. These updated dressing provide increase water absorbency and improved antibacterial efficacy.

=== Wound cleansing ===
Dirt or dust on the surface of the wound, bacteria, tissue that has died, and fluid from the wound may be cleaned. The evidence supporting the most effective technique is not clear and there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether cleaning wounds is beneficial for promoting healing or whether wound cleaning solutions (polyhexamethylene biguanide, aqueous hydrogen peroxide, etc.) are better than sterile water or saline solutions to help venous leg ulcers heal. It is uncertain whether the choice of cleaning solution or method of application makes any difference to venous leg ulcer healing.  

==Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective==
Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships. The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells. The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring. It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.

The growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view. The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles. The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation. Here the following equation is used:

Dtρ0 = Div (R) + R0,

where &quot;ρ&quot; represents mass density, &quot;R&quot; represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and &quot;R0&quot; represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement). Relationships like these can be incorporated into an agent-based models, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.

==Wound closure intentions==
Successful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.

===Primary intention===
Primary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss. In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.

Primary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.

This process is faster than healing by secondary intention. There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue, though some granulation tissue will form.
* Examples of primary intention include: well-repaired lacerations, well reduced bone fractures, healing after flap surgery.
* Early removal of dressings from clean or clean-contaminated wounds does affect primary healing of wounds.

===Secondary intention===
* Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible because of significant tissue damage or loss, usually due to the wound having been created by major trauma.
* The wound is allowed to granulate.
* Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.
* Granulation results in a broader scar.
* Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.
* Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation.
* Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial.
* Examples: gingivectomy, gingivoplasty, tooth extraction sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers.
* There is insufficient evidence that the choice of dressings or topical agents affects the secondary healing of wounds.
* There is lack of evidence for the effectiveness of negative pressure wound therapy in wound healing by secondary intention.

===Tertiary intention===
(Delayed primary closure):
* The wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.
* The wound is purposely left open.
* Examples: healing of wounds by use of tissue grafts.

If the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, or the scab is eaten, and if the &quot;cleansing&quot; of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.

==Overview of involved growth factors==
Following are the main growth factors involved in wound healing:

==Complications of wound healing==

The major complications are many:

# Deficient scar formation: Results in wound dehiscence or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.
# Excessive scar formation: Hypertrophic scar, keloid, desmoid.
# Exuberant granulation (proud flesh).
# Deficient contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).
# Others: Dystrophic calcification, pigmentary changes, painful scars, incisional hernia

Other complications can include infection and Marjolin&#x27;s ulcer.

==Biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds==
Advancements in the clinical understanding of wounds and their pathophysiology have commanded significant biomedical innovations in the treatment of acute, chronic, and other types of wounds. Many biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds have been developed to facilitate wound healing through various mechanisms. This includes a number of products under the trade names such as &quot;Epicel&quot;, &quot;Laserskin&quot;, &quot;Transcyte, Dermagraft, AlloDerm/Strattice, Biobrane, Integra, Apligraf, OrCel, GraftJacket and PermaDerm.&quot;

<text>Tayeb Salih (; 12 July 1929 – 18 February 2009) was a Sudanese writer, novelist, cultural journalist for the BBC Arabic programme as well as for Arabic journals, and a staff member of UNESCO. He is best known for his novel &quot;Season of Migration to the North&quot;, considered to be one of the most important novels in Sudanese Arabic literature. His novels and short stories have been translated into English and more than a dozen other languages.

==Biography==
Born in Karmakol, a village on the Nile near Al Dabbah, Sudan, in the Northern Province of Sudan, he graduated from University of Khartoum with a Bachelor of Science, before leaving for the University of London in the United Kingdom. Coming from a background of small farmers and religious teachers, his original intention was to work in agriculture. However, excluding a brief spell as a schoolmaster before moving to England, he worked in journalism and the promotion of international cultural exchange.

For more than ten years, Salih wrote a weekly column for the London-based Arabic language newspaper &quot;al Majalla&quot;, in which he explored various literary themes. He worked for the BBC&#x27;s Arabic Service and later became director general of the Ministry of Information in Doha, Qatar. The last ten years of his working career, he spent at UNESCO headquarters in Paris, where he held various posts and was UNESCO&#x27;s representative for the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.

==Literary career==

Salih&#x27;s writing draws important inspiration from his youth in a Sudanese village; life that is centered on rural people and their complex relationships. &quot;At various levels and with varying degrees of psychoanalytic emphasis, he deals with themes of reality and illusion, the cultural dissonance between the West and the exotic Orient, the harmony and conflict of brotherhood, and the individual&#x27;s responsibility to find a fusion between his or her contradictions.&quot; Furthermore, the motifs of his books are derived from his religious experience as a Muslim in 20th-century Sudan, both pre- and post-colonial. Another, more general subject of Salih&#x27;s writing is the confrontation of the Arab Muslim and the Western European world.

In 1966, Salih published his novel &quot;Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shimâl (Season of Migration to the North)&quot;, for which he is best known. It was first published in the Beirut journal &quot;Hiwâr&quot;. The main concern of the novel is with the impact of British colonialism and European modernity on rural African societies in general, and on Sudanese culture and identity in particular. His novel reflects the conflicts of modern Sudan and depicts the brutal history of European colonialism as shaping the reality of contemporary Sudanese society. &quot;Season of Migration to the North&quot; is a story told to an unspecified audience by the unnamed narrator, a “traveled man” and an African who has returned after having spent years abroad. He returns to his Sudanese village of Wad Hamid on the Nile in the 1950s after having written a PhD thesis on ‘the life of an obscure English poet’. Mustafa Sa&#x27;eed, the main protagonist of the novel, is a child of British colonialism, and a fruit of colonial education.

In his essay &quot;The New Novel in Sudan&quot;, published in Banipal magazine&#x27;s issue of spring 1966 on &quot;Sudanese Literature today&quot;, Sudanese writer Emad Blake remarked that Salih &quot;confronted the crucial issues of his time, such as the clash of Eastern and Western civilizations, as well as boldly employing sex and a style of writing we might term the &#x27;impossible easy&#x27;.&quot;

The Damascus-based Arab Literary Academy named it one of the best novels in Arabic of the twentieth century. Upon its publication, it was banned in Salih&#x27;s native Sudan for several years, because of its partly sexual content and despite the fact that it won him prominence and international fame. 

&quot;Urs&#x27; al-Zayn&quot; (published in English as The Wedding of Zein) is a novella, published in 1966, centering on the unlikely nuptials of the town eccentric Zein. Tall and odd-looking, with just two teeth in his mouth, Zein has made a reputation for himself as the man who falls in love over and over with girls who promptly marry other men, – to the point where mothers seek him out in hopes that he will draw the eye of available suitors to their eligible daughters. &quot;The Wedding of Zein&quot; was made into a drama in Libya and won Kuwaiti filmmaker Khalid Siddiq an award at the Cannes Film Festival in the late 1970s.

In his reflections on Salih&#x27;s literary style, his translator Denys Johnson-Davies wrote that Salih &quot;exploited to the full the richness of the literary language in his narrative and uses the vivid local dialect for his dialog. [...] Tayeb Salih’s work shows his wide reading in the byways of Arabic literature, including poetry, which has helped to fashion a style which is direct and fluent, a style which an Arab critic has described as being closer to dramatic writing than that of the novel.&quot;

== Awards in honour of Tayeb Salih ==

In 1998, a group of Salih&#x27;s friends formed a committee to honour him, and collected $20,000 for his personal use. He chose to use the money to establish the Tayeb Salih Creative Writing Award. 

Awarded since 2002, the &quot;al-Tayeb Salih Prize for Literary Creativity&quot; is a literary prize for Sudanese novels, presented by the Abdel Karim Mirghani Cultural Center in Omdurman, and is dedicated to first novels by emerging Sudanese writers.

Since 2010, another award, called the &quot;al-Tayeb Salih Award&quot; &quot;for&quot; &quot;Creative Writing&quot;, has been granted to outstanding modern Arab writers in the fields of novel, short story, and critical studies. The award has been sponsored by telecommunications company Zain Sudan and has been critically seen by some Sudanese intellectuals, calling it “an attempt to control the Sudanese cultural scene” by the Ministry of Culture.

<text>King of Egypt (), officially referred to as, King of Egypt, Sovereign of [[Nubia]], [[Sudan]], [[Kordofan]], and [[Darfur]], was the title used by the ruler of Egypt between 1922 and 1951. When the United Kingdom issued the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence on 28 February 1922, thereby ending its protectorate over Egypt, Egypt&#x27;s Sultan Fuad I issued a decree on 15 March 1922 whereby he adopted the title of &quot;King of Egypt&quot;. It has been reported that the title change was due not only to Egypt&#x27;s newly independent status, but also to Fuad I&#x27;s desire to be accorded the same title as the newly installed rulers of the newly created kingdoms of Hejaz, Syria and Iraq. The second monarch to be styled &quot;King of Egypt&quot; was Fuad I&#x27;s son Farouk I, whose title was changed to &quot;King of Egypt and the Sudan&quot; in October 1951 following the Wafdist government&#x27;s unilateral abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The monarchy was abolished on 18 June 1953 following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the establishment of a republic. The third king, the infant Fuad II of Egypt (Farouk having abdicated following the revolution), went into exile in Italy. The position was replaced by the President of Egypt on June 18, 1953.

The rulers of ancient Egypt may be described using the title &quot;King&quot; (a translation of the Egyptian word &quot;&quot;) or &quot;pharaoh&quot; (derived from &quot;&quot;). The story of Moses in the Quran includes his interaction with the ruler of Egypt, named Pharaoh (). The earlier story of Joseph in Islam refers to the Egyptian ruler as a king ().

<doc id="514483" wikidata="Q774692" url="?curid=514483" title="Spiderhunter">
<text>The spiderhunters are birds of the genus Arachnothera, part of the sunbird family Nectariniidae. The genus contains thirteen species found in the forests of south and southeastern Asia. They are large representatives of the sunbird family, with drab plumage and long strongly curved bills. They feed on both nectar and a range of small arthropods.

==Distribution and habitat==
Unlike the rest of the family, which is more widespread, the spiderhunters are confined to the Oriental zoogeographic region, occurring from India east to the Philippines and from the Himalayas south to Java; they reach their greatest species diversity in the Thai-Malay peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. The spiderhunters are mostly forest birds, occupying a wide range of forest types including true rainforest, dipterocarp forest, swamp forest, bamboo forest, secondary forest, forest edge and other highly degraded forest. In addition several species occur in human-created habitat such as gardens or plantations. Most species are lowland species, but the Whitehead&#x27;s spiderhunter is more of a montane species.

==Description==

The spiderhunters are amongst the largest of their family, measuring between in length. The spectacled spiderhunter is the heaviest of the sunbirds, weighing as much as . The bills of the spiderhunters are long, at least twice the length of the head, and are decurved and stout. The tongue forms a complete tube for most of its length. The plumage is much drabber than the other brightly coloured sunbirds, is the same for both sexes, and contains no iridescence. The uppersides of most species are olive-green and the undersides dull white or yellow - in half the species the undersides are streaked. The most atypical spiderhunter plumage is that of the Whitehead&#x27;s spiderhunter, which is dark brown with white streaking on the undersides and back and a yellow rump.

The calls of the spiderhunters are very simple, typically a metallic &quot;chip&quot; which is repeated multiple times to form the song. The song of the little spiderhunter is described as an &quot;incessant squeaky whistle&quot;.

==Diet and feeding==
The spiderhunters are omnivorous. As their name suggests they will eat spiders, and are capable of extracting spiders from the centre of their webs, a tricky task. They also consume a wide range of other small arthropod prey including crickets, caterpillars, butterflies, ants and other insects. In addition to animal prey they also consume nectar from flowers. Their tubular tongue is pushed against the top of the upper mandible of the bill, then pulled in and out, creating a pressure difference which allows the nectar to be sucked into the mouth. Spiderhunters may be important pollinators of some species of plants, and species pollinated by spiderhunters have long tubular flowers. They may also participate in nectar robbing, which consists of inserting the bill into the side of the flower to extract nectar without being dabbed with pollen. Little is known about their territorial behaviour, but there have been reports of some species defending territories. The spiderhunters are less gregarious than other sunbirds, and are usually seen alone or as part of a pair.

==Breeding==
The spiderhunters are thought to be monogamous like most of the rest of the family. They vary from the other sunbirds in the nature of their nest, which is suspended underneath a large leaf, usually a banana leaf but sometimes a palm frond or even a branch. The style of nest can be quite variable, a simple cup in the case of the streaked spiderhunter, an elongated tube for the yellow-eared spiderhunter and a bottle shape for the long-billed spiderhunter. The nests are suspended from the leaf by using spider web or by pushing plant fibres through the leaf. The nests are made of grasses and leaves and lined with soft materials. Nest construction, as is typical of the family, is carried out by the female alone. Unlike the other sunbirds, however, both the male and female incubate the eggs. The spiderhunters lay two or three eggs. Their nests are sometimes parasitised by cuckoos.

==Species== 
The genus contains 13 species:

<doc id="514488" wikidata="Q2360178" url="?curid=514488" title="Norbiton railway station">
<text>Norbiton Railway Station is a railway station located in Norbiton, a suburb in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, in southwest London. It is on the Kingston Loop Line, down the line from . The station and all trains serving it are operated by South Western Railway. It is in Travelcard Zone 5 and is a short walk from Kingston Hospital. It is also the most convenient station for the Kingsmeadow football ground.

==History==
Coaching interests in Kingston were opposed to having a railway in the town and consequently, the London and South Western Railway built its line to Southampton further south through Surbiton. This opposition continued even during the laying of the line from Twickenham although this line did reach a terminus in Kingston in 1863. In 1869 the line was extended through Norbiton to connect to the central line southwest of the present station.

When Queen Victoria visited distinguished residents in the Coombe Hill area, the royal train stopped at Norbiton, the only station in the area where the platform is at ground level. New Malden and Kingston have many steps.
It is the only remaining Victorian railway architecture in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.

==Station facilities==
In February and March 2012 a secure, swipe-card accessible cycle park for 50 cycles was built on Platform 1 replacing the previous set of shelters and bike racks

In August 2009 the platforms were fenced with high steel railings before the installation of ticket barriers. In 2011 the single-width &#x27;off-peak&#x27; gated exit from platform 2 was doubled in width to cope with the large numbers of passengers leaving the station when the barriers are not operational. In 2014 the gated exit was widened again.

During the autumn of 2014, platforms 1 and 2 were raised and the edges reconstructed to reduce the step and gap for passengers getting on and off the trains. Earlier in 2014, the platforms were extended in preparation for longer trains.

There is a 38-space car park and space for 5 vehicles reserved for South Western Railway staff.

== Platforms ==

Norbiton station has two platforms.

*Platform 1 – Trains to London Waterloo via Wimbledon.
*Platform 2 – Trains to London Waterloo via Kingston &amp; Richmond and trains to Shepperton.

== Services ==
All services at Norbiton are operated by South Western Railway.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 
* 2 tph to , returning to London Waterloo via 

On Sundays, the services to and from London Waterloo via Wimbledon are reduced to 2 tph and the services to and from Shepperton and Teddington are reduced to hourly.

==Popular culture references==
In the British sitcom &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;, the station was used as the filming location from which the title character caught his train each morning (with decreasing punctuality). Although Reggie&#x27;s home town in the series was called Climthorpe, a panning shot of the front of the station in the first episode shows him walking into Norbiton station. (The area remains largely unchanged, with the Frederick W. Paine funeral parlour and the zebra crossing across Coombe Road still in place, although a small number of buildings in front of the main station entrance have since been demolished.) David Nobbs may have thought of Climthorpe as near Norbiton, since various other stations between New Malden and London are named in Reggie&#x27;s multiple excuses to explain his poor punctuality .

The station also appeared briefly in a 1971 episode of the Rodney Bewes sitcom &quot;Dear Mother...Love Albert&quot;.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 57, K2, K3, K4 and K5 serve the station.

<text>Add Insult to Injury is the fourth studio album by British electronic musicians Add N to (X). It was released on 16 October 2000 by Mute Records. The album is essentially two mini-albums fused together, as half was written and performed by Ann Shenton and Steve Claydon, while the other half was written and performed by Barry 7, with occasional help from Dean Honer from The All Seeing I.

Early prints of the album came with &#x27;scratch and sniff&#x27; panels (it smelt of grass), and stickers.

<text>Sebastinae is a subfamily of marine fish belonging to the family Scorpaenidae in the order Scorpaeniformes. Their common names include rockfishes, rock perches, ocean perches, sea perches, thornyheads, scorpionfishes, sea ruffes and rockcods. Despite the latter name, they are not closely related to the cods in the genus &quot;Gadus&quot;, nor the rock cod, &quot;Lotella rhacina&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Sebastinae, or Sebastidae, was first formally recognised as a grouping in 1873 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Some authorities recognise this family as distinct from Scorpaenidae. FishBase, a finfish database generated by a consortium of academic institutions, does, but the United States Federal government&#x27;s Integrated Taxonomic Information System and the 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; do not, FotW classify it as a subfamily of the Scorpaenidae.

==Tribes and genera==
Sebastinae is divided into two tribes and seven genera:

* Tribe Sebastini 
** &quot;Helicolenus&quot; 
** &quot;Hozukius&quot; 
** &quot;Sebastes&quot; 
** &quot;Sebastiscus&quot; 
* Tribe Sebastolobini 
** &quot;Adelosebastes&quot; 
** &quot;Sebastolobus&quot; 
** &quot;Trachyscorpia&quot; 

==Characteristics==
Sebastinae species have a compressed body with the head typically having ridges and spines. The gill membranes are not attached to the isthmus. There is a venom gland in the spines of the dorsal, anal and pelvic fins. The largest species is the shortraker rockfish (&quot; Sebastes borealis&quot;) which attains a maximum total length of while the smallest species is &quot;Sebastes koreanus&quot; which reaches a maximum total length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
Sebastinae rockfishes are found in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Oceans with most species in the largest genus, the ovoviviparous &quot;Sebastes&quot; with over 100 species, in the North Pacific. They can be found in marine and brackish waters.

<text>A spinnaker is a sail designed specifically for sailing off the wind on courses between a reach (wind at 90° to the course) to downwind (course in the same direction as the wind). Spinnakers are constructed of lightweight fabric, usually nylon, and are often brightly colored. They may be designed to perform best as either a reaching or a running spinnaker, by the shaping of the panels and seams. They are attached at only three points and said to be &quot;flown&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Some dictionaries suggest that the origin of the word could be traced to the first boat to commonly fly a spinnaker, a yacht called &quot;Sphinx&quot;, mispronounced as &quot;Spinx&quot;. &quot;Sphinx&quot; first set her spinnaker in the Solent in 1865, and the first recorded use of the word was in 1866 in the August edition of &quot;Yachting Calendar and Review&quot; (p. 84). In addition, the term may have been influenced by the spanker, originally a gaff rigged fore-and-aft sail.

Another suggestion is that the idea for the sail was conceived in 1865 by William Gordon, owner of the racing yacht &quot;Niobe&quot;. He wanted to name the sail after his yacht but a crewman&#x27;s comment, &quot;Now there&#x27;s a sail to make her spin&quot; became &quot;spin maker&quot; which developed into the commonly accepted term spinnaker. Gordon was widely known in the yachting world of the time as &quot;Spinnaker Gordon&quot;.

It has been pointed out, however, that the skippers of Thames sailing barges also used the term &quot;spinnaker&quot; for their jib staysails. Unlike the other, tanned sails of these boats, the &quot;spinnakers&quot; were usually white. It has thus been suggested that the term could be &quot;connected with the obsolete word &quot;spoon&quot;, meaning to &quot;run&quot; before the wind (cf. &quot;spindrift&quot;).&quot; Early usage of the verb &quot;to spoon&quot; can be traced back to the 16th century; the change from &quot;spoon&quot; to &quot;spin&quot; in the term &quot;spindrift&quot; is attributed to a local Scottish pronunciation. According to Merriam Webster&#x27;s dictionary, however, &quot;spindrift&quot; derives from a local Scottish pronunciation of &quot;speen&quot; (not &quot;spoon&quot;), meaning &quot;to drive before a strong wind.&quot;

According to Merriam-Webster&#x27;s etymology, the origin of the word &quot;spinnaker&quot; is simply unknown.

== Types ==
There are two main categories of spinnakers, symmetric and asymmetric depending on whether a plane of symmetry exists for that particular sail. Asymmetric spinnakers operate more like a jib, generating lift from the side, rather than the top like a symmetric spinnaker. This makes asymmetrics a better choice on reaching courses than symmetric spinnakers, which excel when running. While a fully equipped racing boat might have a number of spinnakers, both symmetric and asymmetric, to cover all courses and wind conditions, cruising boats almost always use an asymmetric, due to the broader application and easier handling afforded by the asymmetric.

=== Symmetric ===
The symmetric one is the most classic type, running symmetrically alongside the boat controlled by lines known as a sheet and a guy running from the lower two corners of the sail. The windward line, or guy, is attached to the corner called the tack of the sail, and is stabilized by a spinnaker pole. The leeward (downwind) line is called the sheet. It attaches to the clew of the spinnaker and is used to control the shape of the sail. The spinnaker pole must be moved in each gybe, and is quite difficult for beginners to use. However, it can be sailed in all downwind wind directions.

Symmetric spinnakers when sailing across the wind (reaching) develop most of their lift on the forward quarter, where the airflow remains attached. When correctly set for reaching, the leading edges of a symmetric spinnaker should be nearly parallel to the wind, so the flow of air over the leading edge remains attached. When reaching, the sail camber allows only some attached flow over the leeward side of the spinnaker. On running the spinnaker is angled for maximum drag, with the spinnaker pole at right angles to the apparent wind. The symmetric spinnaker also requires care when packing, since the three corners must be available on the top of the packing.

==== Parasailor ====
A Parasailor is a symmetrical spinnaker with a paraglider wing inserted into a gap in the sail approximately mid-way up. This feature makes the sail easier to keep inflated, but detracts from its performance. The sail may be flown on a spinnaker pole or with the tack attached to the bow of the boat.

=== Asymmetric ===

Asymmetrical spinnakers resembling large jibs and flown from spinnaker poles are not a new idea and date back to at least the 19th century. However, in the 1980s a new concept appeared, starting with the Sydney Harbour 18ft Skiff fleet.

Since the 1960s, many faster sailing craft, starting with catamaran classes, have discovered that it is faster to sail downwind on a series of broad reaches with efficient airflow across the sail rather than directly downwind with the sails stalled. This technique had developed to the extent that in bar conversation at the end of one season Andrew Buckland observed that the 18s had sailed all season without pulling the spinnaker pole back from the forestay and that all the systems could be simplified by eliminating the pole and setting the spinnaker from a fixed (but often retractable) bowsprit. The concept quickly evolved to a sail with a loose luff much more like a conventional spinnaker than the old jib-style asymmetric sails. Julian Bethwaite was the first to rig and sail a boat with one the next season, followed shortly by Andrew Buckland. The first modern offshore sailboats to incorporate a retractable bow sprit and an asymmetric spinnaker was the J/Boats J/105.

The concept has spread rapidly through the sailing world. The tack of the sail may be attached at the bow like a genoa but is frequently mounted on a bowsprit, often a retracting one. If the spinnaker is mounted to a special bowsprit, it is often possible to fly the spinnaker and the jib at the same time; if not, then the spinnaker will be shadowed by the jib, and the jib should be furled when the spinnaker is in use.

The asymmetric has two sheets, very much like a jib, but is not attached to the forestay along the length of the luff, but only at the corners. Unlike a symmetric spinnaker, the asymmetric does not require a spinnaker pole, since it is fixed to the bow or bowsprit. The asymmetric is very easy to gybe since it only requires releasing one sheet and pulling in the other one, passing the sail in front of the forestay. Asymmetrics are less suited to sailing directly downwind than spinnakers, and so instead the boat will often sail a zig-zag course downwind, gybing at the corners. An asymmetric spinnaker is particularly effective on fast planing dinghies as their speed generates an apparent wind on the bow allowing them to sail more directly downwind. It is also particularly useful in cruising yachts in the form of a &quot;cruising spinnaker&quot; or &quot;cruising chute&quot;, where the ease of handling is important.

==== Cruising ====
A cruising chute is a form of asymmetric spinnaker used by cruising yachts and designed for easy use when short-handed. Two sheets are used, with the tack line eased by a foot or so before gybing. Alternatively, only one sheet is used, with the sail snuffed before a gybe.

==== Code Zero ====
A Code Zero is a light-weight sail that approaches the dimensions of a genoa jib, for light airs and points of sail up to a close reach. It may be launched furled on its own stay.

===Ratings===
The following codes are used for both symmetric and asymmetric sails.

* Code 1 is a light air reaching sail, where the apparent wind angles at low speeds has a significant effect to create angles of less than 90 degrees.
* Code 2 is a medium air running sail, used for apparent wind angles over 90 degrees.
* Code 3 is a medium air reaching sail, used for apparent wind angles near 90 degrees.
* Code 4 is a heavy air running sail, used in the heaviest winds normally expected.
* Code 5 is a heavy air reaching sail, used in the heaviest winds normally expected.
* Code 6 is a storm sail, for running in storm conditions.

== Setting the sail ==
Since they will only be used on certain points of sail, raising and lowering the spinnaker is a task that is often performed while under sail. Due to the size of spinnakers (the spinnaker is often double or more the size of the mainsail) this can be a difficult operation, since the sail will immediately catch the wind.

===Symmetric ===
Typically the symmetric spinnaker is packed in its own bag, called a &quot;turtle&quot;, with the three corners on top for ready access. The clews (lower corners) are controlled by lines called &quot;sheets&quot;. The sheets are run in front (outside) of the forestay and lead to the back of the boat. The head (top corner) is attached to the spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise the sail up the mast.

Symmetric spinnakers have the windward clew secured to a spinnaker pole. The pole is attached to the mast and holds the windward edge of the sail in position. Lines that control the spinnaker pole are called &quot;guys&quot; or &quot;braces&quot;. The spinnaker pole may be allowed to raise and lower with the force of the wind, or it may have lines attached to it to raise (the &quot;topping lift&quot;) and lower (the &quot;foreguy&quot; or &quot;downhaul&quot;) the angle of the pole. If these lines are used, they are generally set up before setting sail and left in place even when the spinnaker is stowed.

Since spinnakers are downwind sails, they are never tacked, they are only jibed. When jibing a symmetric, the pole is removed from one corner and attached to the opposite corner. This corner now becomes the windward corner. There are two ways this is done. Generally on smaller boats, an end-for-end jibe is accomplished by disconnecting the pole at the mast-end and connecting the mast end to the opposite side of the sail. The old sail end is disconnected and then attached to the mast. This prevents the pole from getting loose during the procedure and allows the use of only two control lines that alternate as sheet and guy (more on this below). End-for-end jibing requires a pole with identical fittings at either end. Larger boats do a dip-pole gybe (jibe) in which the pole remains attached to the mast and the outer end is lowered until it can clear the head-stay and is then raised back up on the other side of the boat to the proper height with the topping lift. The guys are adjusted as before to set the sail angle on the new course. Dip-pole jibing can use a pole with one mast end and one sail end.

Smaller boats tend to use only one line on each clew (a combination &quot;guy&quot; and &quot;sheet&quot;). The windward line that runs through the jaw of the spinnaker pole is referred to as &quot;the guy&quot; (as opposed to foreguy) and the one on the free-flying corner is referred to as &quot;the sheet&quot;. During a jibe, these roles and thus the names are reversed. Larger boats may choose to use both a sheet and guy on each corner, with &quot;the guy&quot; being a heavier line. Having 2 sets of lines will makes the jibe easier as the kite is flown by the two sheets while the crew at the bow and at the mast are removing one guy from the pole and attaching it to the other with no tension on them.

Retrieving the spinnaker is a multi-step process, and the take-down depends on wind position. First, the windward corner is detached from the spinnaker pole and the guy is released. This step is referred to as &quot;blowing the guy&quot;. This allows the spinnaker to collapse into the shadow of the mainsail, where the foot is gathered by a crew member. The halyard is then lowered, and a crew member gathers the sail and stuffs it carefully into the turtle, corners out, and ready for the next deployment. There are, however many other ways to retrieve the spinnaker depending on the conditions and intent. It may or may not go into a turtle. It may be pulled back into the cockpit &amp; then down below to be repacked for the next hoist or be pulled in a foredeck hatch and left free for the next hoist.

===Asymmetric ===
Like the symmetric, the asymmetrical spinnaker is often stored in a turtle, with the corners on top for easy access. While a symmetric spinnaker is flown with a &quot;guy&quot; and a &quot;sheet&quot;, an asymmetric spinnaker is flown with a tackline and a &quot;sheet.&quot; The tack attaches to the bow or (often retractable) bowsprit, and the two sheets attach to the clew. The head of the sail is attached to the spinnaker halyard, which is used to raise the sail. The sheets are passed to either side of the forestay, attached to the clew; they may be passed forward of the luff of the asymmetric, or aft of the luff of the asymmetric, between the tack line and the forestay. The sheet on the downwind (lee) side of the hull is used to trim the sail, and the opposite sheet is left slack. Often a &quot;tack line&quot; is used at leading edge to provide adjustable tension on the luff of the spinnaker. To keep the tack near the centerline of the boat, it may be attached to the forestay with a sliding collar (often riding over the furled jib on parrel beads, tacker or similar device) adjustable with a down haul, or tack line. This allows the tack to slide up and down the forestay to adjust the luff tension. On racing boats, the tack of the asymmetric is often rigged to a retractable bowsprit, which increases the foretriangle area and prevents interference with the jib. As this trend becomes more popular in racing boats, it may result in similar adaptations to cruising boats as well.

Jibing with the asymmetric is much less complex than the symmetric, due to the lack of the spinnaker pole. Much like a jib, all that is required is to change sheets; however, since the asymmetric still flies in front of the forestay, the operation is reversed. The loaded sheet is slackened, and the opposite (lazy) sheet is pulled in, which allows the sail to pass around in front of the forestay, and then be sheeted in on the new lee side of the boat.

Retrieving the asymmetric is similar to the process for the symmetric. The sheets are released, allowing the sail to collapse to the front of the boat. The foot of the sail is then gathered, the halyard released and the head of the sail lowered, where it is packed into the turtle.

===Dousing socks===
The &quot;dousing sock&quot;, &quot;spinnaker sleeve&quot;, &quot;snuffer&quot;, or just &quot;sock&quot;, is a device used to make deploying and retrieving the spinnaker a much easier task. The sock is a long fabric tube with a ring in one end to hold it open. Since the spinnaker is stored in the sock, the first step is to set up the sock. Two lines are attached to the sock; one is attached to a bridle on the ring, for pulling the sock down, and one is up the inside, from the ring, through the top, and back down, for raising the sock; these lines may be two ends of the same line, to form a loop. The head of the spinnaker is attached to the top of the sock and the ring runs down to the tack. The resulting bundle is stuffed into the spinnaker bag. The top of the sock will have provisions for attaching to the spinnaker halyard.

The spinnaker is raised as normal, but with the sock in place, the spinnaker is unable to catch the wind. Once the spinnaker is raised and the guys are ready to set, the sock is raised, releasing the spinnaker. The sock remains bundled up at the head of the sail while the spinnaker is deployed. To retrieve the spinnaker, the sheet or the tack is released and the sock is pulled down, gathering the sail. The halyard is then dropped and the sail may be packed away.

==Spinnaker launching and dousing systems==
As of 2006, there were a variety of means to aid the launching (hoisting) and dousing (taking down) of a spinnaker—a sail which, in lacking luff support, is &quot;more unstable and more difficult&quot; to handle in these and related situations. One system focuses on the launching of the spinnaker, only, and it makes use of special sail-packing and a funnel system that places breakable elastic bands as the sail is launched, bands that break as sheet and guy of the filled spinnaker are trimmed.

Other systems use means that assist with both launching and dousing, and such systems include:

* sail modification to include a center patch and cringle to attach a retriever line (also termed a &quot;takedown line&quot;) to use in sail launching and dousing, and use of a funnel-terminating, hull-affixed tubular launcher for storage and launching (through which the retriever passes); and
* used of a tubular, ring-ended sleeve or &quot;sock&quot; which also stores the sail, which after launching (sock hoisting) is rigged such that the sock&#x27;s top ring is toward the halyard and bottom ring toward the deck, where release of the spinnaker is accomplished by rigging that draws the bottom ring toward the halyard, allowing the bottom of the sail to fill, a design that leaves the collapsed sock aloft &quot;at the head of the spinnaker while it is flying&quot;.

===Spinnaker chutes===
A &quot;spinnaker chute&quot; is a means of launching and dousing (recovering) the spinnaker. Found most commonly on modern dinghy designs and updated older classes, it often consists of a tube or an aperture mounted on the deck close to the forestay. To allow recovery of the spinnaker into the chute during dousing, the spinnaker is fitted with one or more &quot;recovery patches&quot; to, or through which, the tail of the spinnaker halyard is attached or passed; the spinnaker head and its halyard form a continuous loop, passing through the chute.

If the spinnaker chute is within the hull and is required to be watertight, it takes the form of a hard tube sealed to the hull at both ends. If a watertight arrangement is not required, a cloth tube may be used to contain the lowered spinnaker.

==Other uses==
A masthead, symmetrical spinnaker is occasionally used for entertainment at anchor to loft a person hanging beneath it above the water. To work, the vessel must be anchored stern to the wind to allow the sail to extend out over the bow.

<text>The 2003 Quebec general election was held on April 14, 2003, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec (Canada). The Parti libéral du Québec (PLQ), led by Jean Charest, defeated the incumbent Parti Québécois, led by Premier Bernard Landry, in a landslide.

In Champlain there was a tie between PQ candidate Noëlla Champagne and Liberal candidate Pierre-A. Brouillette; although the initial tally was 11,867 to 11,859, a judicial recount produced a tally of 11,852 each. A new election was held on May 20 and was won by Champagne by a margin of 642 votes.

==Unfolding==

In January 2001, Lucien Bouchard announced that he would resign from public life, citing that the results of his work were not very convincing. In March 2001, the Parti Québécois selected Bernard Landry as leader by acclamation, thus becoming premier of Quebec. In 2002, the Parti Québécois (PQ) government had been in power for two mandates. It was seen as worn-out by some, and its poll numbers fell sharply. It placed third at its lowest point. An important part of its support was going to the Action Démocratique du Québec (ADQ) and its young leader, Mario Dumont. Some PQ supporters had left for the Liberal party.

Landry, leader of the PQ, undertook a revitalization of the party and its image. As the ideas of the conservative nature of ADQ&#x27;s platform became more apparent, that party&#x27;s popularity declined. Social democratic measures taken by the PQ government, like the passing of the &quot;Law against poverty&quot; helped improve the PQ&#x27;s standing in the public opinion polls. PLQ leader Jean Charest initially continued to be unpopular with voters.

The 2003 election happened against the backdrop of the war in Iraq. The battles of that war took place during the first half of the campaign, diverting the attention of the media and the population. Landry became known for his custom of wearing the white ribbon (which in 2003 was worn by people in favour of peace). This custom was shortly followed by the two other main party leaders, Charest and Dumont. Landry was the most outspoken critic of the war. The other two were more discreet on the matter. Charest once stated that it was an opportunity to reaffirm his &quot;belief in peace&quot;. Dumont acted in a similar way, while also addressing criticism to Landry, saying that Quebecers should refrain from criticizing Americans too harshly since Americans were historical friends of Quebecers.

The desire for change was considered an important factor of the campaign (see &quot;Change&quot;, below). However, while reminding voters that the fundamental change was at the core of its primary ideal, sovereignty, the PQ focused its message and publicity not on change, but on stability. Its campaign slogan emphasized this (see the Campaign slogans below). Landry also tried to portray the vote as being a choice between the left wing PQ and &quot;two parties of the right&quot;. The PLQ portrayed itself as centrist. The PLQ produced dynamic ads and material, and released a new, &quot;younger&quot; logo. The ADQ put forward its young, underdog leader, and denied being too much to the right. It first broadcast a negative advertisement (a bleak television spot speaking of &quot;deaths&quot; in the hospitals) that backfired substantially, with criticism from opponents and citizens. It shortly released a brighter, more positive advertising.

Despite the PQ&#x27;s recovery of support, Charest appeared as a viable alternative for people in desire of change, especially during the Leaders&#x27; Debate. Also, the Parizeau Affair sparked by Charest is said to have harmed Landry&#x27;s campaign up to election day. The PQ lead in the public opinion polls vanished by mid-campaign.

The Parti Libéral won the election, while Parti Québécois won a respectable number of seats. The ADQ won four seats, which was a considerable improvement from previous general elections. It was nonetheless a disappointment for the party since it had five sitting members as a result of by-election victories in the previous year. It had also had a high standing in the polls of that same year. This was the first general election for the new left-wing Union des forces progressistes.

A documentary about Bernard Landry&#x27;s point of view of the campaign was released in 2003 called À Hauteur d&#x27;homme. It was directed by Jean-Claude Labrecque.

==Issues==

===Health care===
Jean Charest and the PLQ focused their campaign upon the issue of health care and reducing waiting lists. The other major parties criticized Charest for planning to invest only in health care and education, while freezing other budgets. Landry argued that money for health care would be available when the fiscal imbalance was solved by sovereignty. He vowed to fight for money from Ottawa until then, as he had done earlier that year (see the &quot;Fiscal Imbalance&quot;, below). Charest portrayed Landry as putting sovereignty ahead of health care, and presented his party as the one that would make health care its first priority. He also accused Landry&#x27;s government of using waiting lists as an administration procedure for hospitals.

===Change===
The desire for change was considered by the media to be a major deciding factor of the vote. The media were criticized by the PQ and some citizens as &quot;wanting change for the sake of change&quot;, since the government had ended its term with an economy doing well and high satisfaction polls for an outgoing administration. Landry reminded voters that, while voting for his party did not change the government right away, the first ideal of the PQ, sovereignty, was &quot;the greatest of changes&quot;. At the Leaders&#x27; Debate, Charest told viewers that those wanting change should vote for the PLQ since &quot;A vote for the ADQ is a vote for the PQ&quot;. At the time, the ADQ was considered to be too low in the polls to be a potential victor. Charest&#x27;s reminder of the spoiler effect is said to have been partly responsible for his victory on election day. The results on election day appear to have demonstrated the voters&#x27; desire for change.

===Income tax===
Charest presented a plan of major reduction of income tax, which Landry opposed. Quebec&#x27;s income taxes are the highest in North America, but its social programs are also relatively generous, and the gap between rich and poor is the lowest of the North American continent. The ADQ presented a flat tax plan in 2002. This proved to be highly unpopular, and contributed to the image of the party as being too conservative. This plan, in its pure form, was dropped in the beginning of 2003. The ADQ claimed that, after further examination, the Quebec government did not have the resources to implement it. This, again, hurt the party further by giving it the image of flip flopping.

===State size and intervention===
The PQ government was criticized by the two other major parties for being too interventionist, maintaining an overly large government, and for practising statism. Dumont spoke of Landry and the PQ&#x27;s &quot;Social bureaucracy&quot;, a pun on the Social democracy the PQ defends. Landry responded to Charest and Dumont that &quot;Quebecers do not want less state, they want better state&quot;. Dumont had previously proposed a drastic reduction in the size of the civil service, but this was also softened before the campaign.

===Family-work conciliation===
The &quot;conciliation famille-travail&quot; became an important issue of the campaign as a result of Landry&#x27;s &quot;Four day work-week&quot; plan. This proposal would have required Quebec employers to offer the option of a four-day work week to parents. This was presented by the PQ as a way to enhance family life, lower the stress on parents, and of counteracting the fall in Quebec&#x27;s birthrate since the Quiet Revolution. The plan was attacked by the PLQ and ADQ as being &quot;improvised&quot; since it was only presented near the beginning of the election. It attracted some interest and support from voters, enough for Charest to declare, days before voting day, that he could consider implementing a four-day week, although the PLQ has not mentioned this since the election.

===Fiscal imbalance===
The theory of a fiscal imbalance between Ottawa and Quebec City was maintained and denounced by all major parties. Charest argued that the co-operative approach of a federalist party like the PLQ would be more effective solving the problem. As proof that the PQ would be able to solve the fiscal imbalance, Landry pointed to his success of early 2003, when he, along with the English Canadian Premiers, managed to come to an agreement with Prime Minister of Canada Jean Chrétien for more money to finance health care. He promised to continue the &quot;battle&quot; to solve the imbalance until independence is achieved.
===City mergers===
The PQ government, during the premiership of Landry&#x27;s predecessor Lucien Bouchard, had merged the major cities of Quebec. The government argued that the mergers would allow a better division of the wealth and responsibilities between richer suburban communities and poorer parts of the main cities. The mergers occurred despite widespread opposition in some municipalities. Many Quebecers were still disgruntled, especially in wealthier and anglophone communities. The PLQ proposed to allow referendums on de-amalgamation in communities where there was sufficient support. The PQ and the ADQ strongly opposed the idea.

===Sovereignty and autonomy===
While the PQ continued to promote sovereignty for Quebec with its usual arguments (dignity, culture, globalization, etc.), it was also presented by the PQ as a way to solve the fiscal imbalance problem. The ADQ made great efforts to avoid taking a position on the subject of independence in order to attract both sides of the National Question spectrum. The ADQ positioned itself as a &quot;third way&quot; to Quebecers between what Dumont called &quot;radical separation&quot; and &quot;knelt down federalism&quot;. The ADQ had worked in favour of sovereignty during the 1995 Quebec referendum, but had been equivocal on the subject since then.

The PLQ criticized the PQ for using the politics of confrontation because of its sovereignty position, and argued that a PLQ government would restore Quebec&#x27;s &quot;leadership role&quot; in the federation. Landry promised a third referendum on independence &quot;in 1000 days&quot;, confirming the plan he had set out in the Declaration of Gatineau, with support for independence running very low and support for a referendum running even lower in opinion polls; this did not prove to be a popular position. An argument of Landry for this timetable was that he wanted Quebec to be present at the Summit of the Americas in Buenos Aires in 2005. Representation for Quebec had been denied by Ottawa at the previous summit held in Quebec City, an act that angered many Quebecers. At the same time, Landry kept the door opened to federalist support for the PQ and stated that he would only hold a referendum if he had the &quot;moral assurance&quot; of winning it. This lead Charest to accuse him of having a &quot;hidden agenda&quot;, during the Leaders&#x27; Debate.

===Parizeau Affair===
On the day of the leaders&#x27; debate, Charest&#x27;s advisors gave him an article from the website of the Trois-Rivières newspaper &quot;Le Nouvelliste&quot; that spoke of past PQ leader Jacques Parizeau restating his controversial remarks about &quot;money and the ethnic vote&quot; which he had made in his 1995 referendum concession speech. The truth of the article was later disputed, yet despite the uncertainty surrounding this article, Charest surprised Landry with it during the leaders&#x27; debate on live television. This created a new controversy that ran for some days following the debate, and was said to have hurt Landry&#x27;s campaign. The PQ denounced Charest for launching an &quot;immoral attack&quot; on Parizeau&#x27;s reputation and dignity, saying that the article was incorrect in concluding that he had repeated his comments, but this method of response was not enough to defuse the controversy. The aftermath of the leaders&#x27; debate is thoroughly treated in the &quot;À Hauteur d&#x27;homme&quot; documentary, and became known as the Parizeau Affair.

===Day care===
The &quot;five dollar-a-day child care&quot; program implemented by the PQ government of Lucien Bouchard was one of the most appreciated achievements of the recent PQ administration. Some parents still did not have access to it, however, because of a lack of sufficient places. Landry, who had been Minister of Finance when the plan was implemented, vowed to continue creating more spaces. Charest presented his team as the most capable for this task. He also vowed to keep the price at $5 a day. He broke this promise later that year. See Opposition to the Charest government.

===Public debt===
The Action Démocratique insisted that the Government of Quebec should pay down the public debt. The other major leaders did not see it as a priority.

<text>A mainsail is a sail rigged on the main mast of a sailing vessel.

* On a square rigged vessel, it is the lowest and largest sail on the main mast.

* On a fore-and-aft rigged vessel, it is the sail rigged aft of the main mast. The sail&#x27;s foot is normally attached to a boom. (In extremely heavy weather, the mainsail may be lowered, and a much smaller trysail hoisted in its place).

Historical fore-and-aft rigs used a four-sided gaff rigged mainsail, sometimes setting a gaff topsail above it.

Whereas once the mainsail was typically the largest sail, today the mainsail may be smaller than the jib or genoa; Prout catamarans typically have a mainmast stepped further aft than in a standard sloop, so that the mainsail is much smaller than the foresail.

== Bermuda rig ==

The modern Bermuda rig uses a triangular mainsail aft of the mast, closely coordinated with a jib for sailing upwind. A large overlapping jib or genoa is often larger than the mainsail. In downwind conditions (with the wind behind the boat) a spinnaker replaces the jib.

Some mainsails are &quot;full-batten&quot; mainsails, meaning the batten extends all the way from the mast to the leach of a sail. A partial batten extends from the leech partway to the mast. Battens enable the mainsail to project farther away from the mast. However, there is some cost associated with the battens themselves, &quot;batten pockets&quot; need to be sewn into the sail, and &quot;batten cars&quot; may be needed to allow the sail to be raised and lowered.

Before Nathanael Greene Herreshoff&#x27;s invention of sail tracks and slides in the 1880s, mainsails were limited in height. Traditional mainsails were held against the mast by hoops that went the full way around the mast. This meant a traditional mainsail could be raised no higher than the first point a rope or wire was required to keep the mast upright. Further mainsail area (and height) was obtained by adopting a gaff rig.

A mainsail may be fixed to the boom via slugs, cars, or a bolt-rope, or may be &quot;loose-footed,&quot; meaning it is only attached at the tack and clew.

<doc id="514505" wikidata="Q2068759" url="?curid=514505" title="Jor-El">
<text>Jor-El is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, Jor-El first appeared in the &quot;Superman&quot; newspaper comic strip in 1939.

Jor-El is Superman&#x27;s biological father, the husband of Lara, and a leading scientist on the planet Krypton before its destruction. He foresees his planet&#x27;s fate but is unable to convince his colleagues in time to rescue most of Krypton&#x27;s inhabitants. Jor-El is able to save his infant son Kal-El (Superman) by launching him towards Earth in a homemade spaceship just moments before Krypton explodes. When Superman later constructs his headquarters, the Fortress of Solitude, he honors his biological parents with the inclusion of a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a globe of Krypton. The fortress also holds a holographic copy of Jor-El&#x27;s consciousnesses, letting Superman interact with his father for advice and knowledge.

Jor-El was portrayed by Marlon Brando in the films &quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;Superman II&quot;. Archival footage cut from the prior films was used with the permission of Brando&#x27;s estate to insert the deceased Brando into 2006&#x27;s &quot;Superman Returns&quot; in a reprise of the role. Terence Stamp played the voice or Jor-El in the television series Smallville and was portrayed by Julian Sands. The character was then portrayed by Russell Crowe in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Angus Macfadyen portrayed the character in the first season of the television series &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;.

== Fictional character biography ==
=== Precursor (&quot;New Adventure Comics&quot;) ===
Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegel, the creators of both Superman and Jor-L, first introduced a character named &quot;Jor-L&quot; in 1936, more than a year before the first Superman story was published. The original &quot;Jor-L&quot; appeared in &quot;New Adventure Comics&quot; (released in 1936, cover-dated January 1937), a re-titled issue #12 of the previous &quot;New Comics&quot;, which would be re-titled again, starting with issue #32, as the 45-year-long &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; series.

Featured in the four-page Shuster and Siegel strip &quot;Federal Men&quot;, this &quot;Jor-L&quot; is not an extraterrestrial but, instead, a far-future &quot;ace sleuth&quot; in the service of &quot;Interplanetary Federation Headquarters&quot;. The character battles &quot;Nira-Q&quot;, the outer-space-faring &quot;bandit queen&quot;, in the year 3000 A.D. The 1936 &quot;Jor-L&quot; exists as part of a story within a story, as Shuster and Siegel&#x27;s strip presents the tale as a scientist&#x27;s forecast of future crime-fighting told to the contemporary 1930s-era G-man heroes of &quot;Federal Men&quot;.

=== &quot;Golden Age&quot; and &quot;Silver Age&quot; versions ===
Jor-El was first referred to indirectly in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 in 1938, which only mentioned a scientist who sends his son to Earth. He made his first full-fledged appearance in the &quot;Superman&quot; newspaper comic strip on January 16, 1939, where his name was spelled as &quot;Jor-L&quot;. His name first appeared as being spelled &quot;Jor-el&quot; in the &quot;Superman&quot; novel &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; (1942) written by George Lowther. Later comic books capitalized the &quot;E&quot; in &quot;El.&quot; Jor-El&#x27;s first appearance in a comic book was in &quot;More Fun Comics&quot; #101. 
In the 1960s, now known as part of the Silver Age of Comic Books, DC Comics introduced to its superhero stories the fictional concept of different versions of characters from real-world publication history existing in separate &quot;universes&quot; that could communicate with each other. As DC developed this concept through further stories, the version of Superman&#x27;s father during the previous Golden Age of Comic Books was identified as &quot;Jor-&quot;L&quot;&quot;, matching the original spelling of the character&#x27;s name, who lived on the Krypton of the Earth-Two &quot;universe&quot; (derived from the versions of characters and stories that appeared during the earlier &quot;Golden Age&quot; period of publication history). In contrast, the concept presented &quot;Jor-&quot;El&quot;&quot; as no longer another spelling of the same name but a different character entirely: the father of the then-contemporary &quot;Silver Age&quot; version of Superman, who lived on the Krypton of the Earth-One &quot;universe&quot; (used to describe the setting for then-current &quot;Silver Age&quot; stories and characters, some of which had been substantially changed from their &quot;Golden Age&quot; versions).

A retelling of Superman&#x27;s origin story in 1948 first delved into detail about Jor-El. However, his formal and more familiar Silver Age aspects were firmly established starting in the late 1950s. Over the course of the next several decades, there was a definitive summarization in the miniseries &quot;World of Krypton&quot; in 1979 (not to be confused with the similarly-named post-&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; late-1980s comic miniseries).

==== His accomplishments ====
As presented in the &quot;World of Krypton&quot; miniseries and other stories from the Silver Age of Comic Books, Jor-El is Krypton&#x27;s leading scientist, inventing, among other devices, a self-titled hovercar. He also discovers a parallel plane of existence which he calls the Phantom Zone and invents a device that can open portals to it. This device gets him a seat on the Science Council, Krypton&#x27;s ruling body. He lives in Krypton&#x27;s major city of Kryptonopolis.

Even before Jor-El&#x27;s birth, the El family is renowned for its contributions to Kryptonian society. Ancestors of Jor-El include Val-El, an explorer; Sul-El, the inventor of Krypton&#x27;s first telescope; Tala-El, the author of Krypton&#x27;s first planetary constitution; Hatu-El, the inventor of Krypton&#x27;s first electromagnet and electric motor; and Gam-El, the father of modern Kryptonian architecture.

==== Family life ====

Jor-El has two brothers: Zor-El, who lives in Argo City and eventually becomes the father of Kara, alias Supergirl, and an identical twin brother named Nim-El, who lives in Kandor. In several stories, Jor-El&#x27;s father is established as Jor-El I, and his mother as Nimda (née An-Dor). Jor-El eventually meets and marries Lara, the daughter of Lor-Van and a young astronaut in Krypton&#x27;s fledgling space program, which is shut down after Jax-Ur destroys Krypton&#x27;s moon Wegthor.

==== Jor-El&#x27;s warnings of Krypton&#x27;s doom ====
When Krypton begins experiencing a series of earthquakes, Jor-El investigates. He soon discovers, to his horror, that Krypton&#x27;s core is extremely unstable and radioactive, and will eventually reach critical mass and explode, taking the entire planet and its populace with it. Jor-El tries to convince the members of the Science Council of this impending disaster and urges re-establishing Krypton&#x27;s space program so giant spacecraft can be built to carry the populace to another habitable world. However, the Council is dismissive of Jor-El&#x27;s findings and refuses to comply with his plan. Some even accuse him of treachery, trying to cause chaos so he can take over. This had been General Zod&#x27;s failed plot, causing his banishment to the Phantom Zone. Thus, the Council is wary of Jor-El&#x27;s motives.

Around the time he discovers Krypton&#x27;s impending doom, Jor-El meets his own son Kal-El without realizing it, after Kal-El accidentally travels back in time. There are supporters of Jor-El&#x27;s theory, but when a ship is constructed to evacuate them, the city of Kandor is shrunken and stolen by Brainiac, removing the people who believe in Jor-El&#x27;s work.

Frustrated, Jor-El continues his work on space travel on his own, hoping to build a spacecraft to save his family. This work includes launching several smaller test rockets; one of these rockets includes the family dog Krypto. However, as time runs short, Jor-El only has enough time to build a spacecraft to save his son Kal-El. He decides to send Kal-El to Earth, realizing he will gain superhuman powers under Earth&#x27;s yellow sun and lower gravity. As Krypton goes through its final destructive stages, Jor-El and Lara place their son in the rocket and launch him toward Earth, before they are killed along with almost all the rest of the planet&#x27;s population. Lara could have fit inside the rocket as well, but chose to stay behind to improve Kal-El&#x27;s chances of reaching Earth.

=== Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; ===
After the 1985-1986 miniseries &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and John Byrne&#x27;s 1986 miniseries &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; rewrote Superman&#x27;s origins, details about Jor-El&#x27;s background and character were changed. In Byrne&#x27;s version, Jor-El inhabits a cold and emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact is forbidden. Indeed, Jor-El himself is considered a &quot;throwback&quot; for actually expressing emotions toward his mate Lara and favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. Another change in this version is Jor-El genetically altering his son&#x27;s fetus (gestating in a &quot;birthing matrix&quot;) to allow him to leave Krypton (in this version of the mythos, Kryptonians are genetically &quot;bonded&quot; to the planet itself, not allowing them to leave) and merely attaching a warp engine to the matrix instead of constructing a ship wholesale. The result is that Kal-El is &quot;born&quot; when the birthing matrix opens on Earth.

In the 1990s series &quot;Starman&quot; Jor-El meets a time-traveling Jack Knight and Mikaal Tomas, two individuals who both bear at various points the name &quot;Starman&quot;, and are accidentally sent 70 years back in time and hurled across space. Jor-El thereby first learns of Earth&#x27;s existence; in return, Jor-El helps Knight and Tomas escape from his overbearing father Seyg-El.

In the 2004 miniseries &quot;&quot;, Jor-El, along with Krypton and Lara, was, more or less, reinstated to his Silver Age versions, though with such updated touches as Lara contributing equally to the effort of sending Kal-El, once again an infant while on Krypton, to Earth. In this version, Jor-El discovers Earth moments before launching his son&#x27;s spacecraft. Also, the conclusion of the miniseries has the adult Superman, on Earth, seeing his parents through Lex Luthor&#x27;s time-space communicator, and on Krypton, seconds before its destruction, Jor-El and Lara see their son alive and well on Earth and know that their efforts are successful. As with Byrne&#x27;s conflicting view of Krypton, the &quot;Birthright&quot; origins of Jor-El, Krypton, and Luthor have been retconned, and, following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, they are no longer valid in comics canon.

However, a more recent storyline co-written by Geoff Johns and &quot;Superman&quot; director Richard Donner presented yet another version of Jor-El and Krypton which reintroduced General Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals. With art by Adam Kubert, Jor-El is depicted for the first time with a beard and the design of Kryptonian society is distinct yet again from &quot;Birthright&quot; and &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, incorporating elements of Donner&#x27;s work on the first two Christopher Reeve films, in particular the notion of Krypton&#x27;s Council threatening Jor-El with harsh penalty of exile to the very Phantom Zone he himself discovered if he is to make public his predictions of their planet&#x27;s imminent doom or otherwise attempt to &quot;create a climate of panic.&quot;

Jor-El is shown here to have been mentored by friend and noted scientist Non, who corroborates Jor-El&#x27;s findings regarding Krypton&#x27;s impending destruction, when the two are arrested and brought to trial before the Council by Zod and Ursa. When Non defies the Council&#x27;s dire prohibitions and elects to spread the word of the coming apocalypse, he is abducted by Council agents and apparently lobotomized, thus explaining the character&#x27;s mute simple-mindedness, brutality and destructiveness in line with Jack O&#x27;Halloran&#x27;s performance as Non in the first two Reeve films. Appalled, Zod and Ursa propose to Jor-El that they band together and overthrow the Council, but Jor-El will have none of it. When their murderous insurrection fails, the Council forces Jor-El to exile them to the Phantom Zone and never speak of his findings again, lest he face the same fate. For this perceived betrayal, Zod declares that he will escape and conquer Krypton (confident that Jor-El will discover some way to save the planet) and force the scientist and his son to kneel before him one day.

Having been re-built via a Kryptonian crystal during the &quot;One Year Later&quot; story arc, the current version of the Fortress of Solitude, which is also designed to essentially be visually identical to the Donner and Bryan Singer films, now contains an advanced interactive &quot;recording&quot; of Jor-El which, although visually dissimilar to Marlon Brando, is otherwise identical in function to that featured in &quot;Superman Returns&quot;.

&quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #50 presents Jor-El sending a probe to Earth that makes contact with Thomas Wayne while he is on a drive with a pregnant Martha, the probe holographically transmitting Thomas&#x27; consciousness to Krypton so that Jor-El can better learn what kind of world Earth is to help him decide which of many possible candidates he should send his son to. Thomas tells Jor-El that the people of Earth are not perfect, but are essentially a good and kind race who will raise the child right, convincing Jor-El to send Kal-El there. Thomas records his encounter in a diary, which is discovered by his son Bruce Wayne in the present day.

=== &quot;The New 52&quot; and &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; ===

Following two line-wide revisions of DC superhero comic books, branded by DC Comics as “New 52” and “DC Rebirth”, the character Jor-El was revised to be still alive due to being rescued by Doctor Manhattan. After being nursed back to health by locals, Jor-El sees firsthand the atrocities of man, as a dictator usurps all of what the people own, causing them to starve. After witnessing these atrocities, Jor-El is forced to watch the horrors of mankind over the centuries and becomes Mister Oz. Jor-El becomes dissatisfied with humanity and attempts to force his son and his family to leave in the belief that Earth cannot be saved, but when Superman forces him to acknowledge that he is attacking his own son, he withdraws. It is later established that Jor-El is a member of the Circle, a clandestine organization composed of five powerful cosmic beings and intergalactic rulers including the Guardian of the Universe Appa Ali Apsa, Sardath, and Rogol Zaar, the being who destroyed Krypton. Jor-El is later discovered to have created Rogol Zaar and is transported back in time to die.

===Films===
====Live-action====
* Jor-El appears in &quot;Superman&quot; (1948), portrayed by Nelson Leigh.

=====1978 series=====
* Jor-El appears in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978), portrayed by Marlon Brando. The film originated the idea of Superman&#x27;s iconic &quot;S&quot;-shield symbol originally being the family crest of the House of El, which resembles an Earth &quot;S&quot; by coincidence. Originally conceived by Brando himself and suggested on-set, this origin of the famous Superman symbol has been used in many stories since. In the current comics, however, the shield is the Kryptonian symbol for &quot;hope,&quot; and not only is it worn by Jor-El in a similar manner to Brando of the first feature film, but it adorns all manner of Kryptonian flags, clothing, spaceships, and equipment.
* Brando filmed additional footage for &quot;Superman II&quot;, before differences behind the scenes caused his footage to be cut. However, it was later restored for the 2006 revised version, &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;. In the &quot;Richard Donner Cut&quot;, Jor-El again appears as an image, posthumously attempting to guide and inform Kal-El. Jor-El&#x27;s historical crystals reveal to Lex Luthor the existence of the three Phantom Zone criminals General Zod, Ursa and Non, which makes Luthor realize just who and what they are (and that it was Superman who caused their release). Jor-El is asked by Clark if he can live a life as a human with Lois, and he tries to persuade Clark not to wish so, but Clark is firm in his wish. Jor-El then reveals the crystal chamber with the rays of Krypton&#x27;s red sun which will make Clark human forever. Later, Clark returns to find all the crystals and information regarding Krypton destroyed, but finds the original crystal and is able to bring back Jor-El. Jor-El sacrifices his remaining life-force to restore his son&#x27;s powers so that Superman can save Earth from Zod. Superman later destroys the Fortress after it has been breached by Luthor and the Phantom Zone criminals, but then goes back in time, where it remains normal.
* Jor-El appears in &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, portrayed again by Marlon Brando via archival footage.

=====DC Extended Universe=====
* Jor-El appears in &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, portrayed by Russell Crowe. Rejecting the Kryptonian tradition of eugenics and artificial birth, this version stole the Kryptonian genetic codex to preserve the Kryptonian race and provide his son with the distinction of choosing his own destiny, creating Kal-El, who is then sent to Earth before Krypton&#x27;s destruction. Following a 33-year imprisonment in stasis for an attempted coup in which he murdered Jor-El, General Zod and his lieutenants pursue the infant to Earth, where Clark Kent first encounters his father via an interactive computer hologram that simulates his father&#x27;s personality and knowledge. The AI of Jor-El was later destroyed by General Zod.

===Novels===
====&quot;Superman: Last Son of Krypton&quot;====
In the Elliot S. Maggin 1978 novel &quot;&quot;, Jor-El is shown as having sent a navigation probe ahead of Kal-El&#x27;s spaceship, to find a suitable foster parent on his new planet. In Kryptonian society, scientific achievement was a preeminent virtue, so Jor-El&#x27;s probe was programmed to seek out the leading scientific mind on Earth, presumably to adopt Kal-El. The probe landed (in the early 1950s, although the date is non-specific) in Princeton, New Jersey, where it soon appeared outside the window of Albert Einstein and communicated its mission to him through telepathy, along with precise details of where Kal-El&#x27;s rocket would land (near Smallville, Kansas), several days later.

====&quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot;====
In the 2007 novel &quot;The Last Days of Krypton&quot; by Kevin J. Anderson, Jor-El is shown as a science hero who is respected and admired by all of the people of Krypton and has a standing offer of a place on the Council. Yet his clashing with this conservative Council over new discoveries supplies much of the tension in the book. General Zod and his two minions make a bid to take over Krypton, first posing as Krypton&#x27;s saviors.

<doc id="514507" wikidata="Q927770" url="?curid=514507" title="Argumentum ad captandum">
<text>In rhetoric, an argumentum ad captandum, &quot;for capturing&quot; the gullibility of the naïve among the listeners or readers, is an unsound, specious argument designed to appeal to the emotions rather than to the mind. It is used to describe &quot;claptrap or meretricious attempts to catch popular favor or applause.&quot; 

The longer form of the term is ad captandum vulgus (Latin, &quot;to ensnare the vulgar&quot; or &quot;to captivate the masses&quot;); the shorter and longer versions of the phrase are synonymous. The word &quot;vulgus&quot; in Latin meant the common people, the multitude; it was also sometimes used contemptuously to imply a rabble or a mob. 

The &quot;ad captandum&quot; approach is commonly seen in political speech, advertising, and popular entertainment. The classic example of something &quot;ad captandum vulgus&quot; was the &quot;bread and circuses&quot; by which the Roman emperors maintained the support of the people of Rome.

<doc id="514509" wikidata="Q536554" url="?curid=514509" title="Vaginal lubrication">
<text>Vaginal lubrication is a naturally produced fluid that lubricates the vagina. Vaginal lubrication production increases significantly during sexual arousal in anticipation of sexual intercourse. Vaginal dryness is the condition in which this lubrication is insufficient, and sometimes artificial lubricants are used to augment it. Without sufficient lubrication, sexual intercourse can be painful. The vaginal lining has no glands, and therefore the vagina must rely on other methods of lubrication. Plasma from the vaginal walls due to vascular engorgement is considered to be the chief lubrication source, and the Bartholin&#x27;s glands, located slightly below and to the left and right of the introitus (vaginal opening), also secrete mucus to augment vaginal wall secretions. Near ovulation, cervical mucus provides additional lubrication.

==Mechanism==
===Composition===

Vaginal lubrication fluid is a plasma transudate which diffuses across the vaginal wall. Composition varies with the length of arousal.

During arousal, vaginal lubrication, also sometimes called &quot;arousal fluid&quot;, is produced. This is clear, thin, and slippery. It typically only lasts up to an hour. It can sometimes be confused with cervical mucus.

===Production===
The human vagina is serviced by nerves that respond to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). As a result, VIP induces an increase in vaginal blood flow accompanied by an increase in vaginal lubrication. The findings suggest that VIP may participate in the control of the local physiological changes observed during sexual arousal: genital vasodilation and an increase in vaginal lubrication. Neuropeptide Y is also involved in producing it.

==Vaginal dryness==
Insufficient lubrication or vaginal dryness can cause dyspareunia, which is a type of sexual pain disorder. While vaginal dryness is considered an indicator for sexual arousal disorder, vaginal dryness may also result from insufficient excitement and stimulation or from hormonal changes caused by menopause (potentially causing atrophic vaginitis), pregnancy, or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sexual intimacy. Vaginal dryness can also be a symptom of Sjögren syndrome (SS), a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body destroys moisture-producing glands.

Certain medications, including some over-the-counter antihistamines, as well as life events such as pregnancy, lactation, menopause, aging or diseases such as diabetes, will inhibit lubrication. Medicines with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic effects will dry out the mucosal or &quot;wet&quot; tissues of the vagina. Such medicines include many common drugs for allergenic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, and other medical conditions. Oral contraceptives may also increase or decrease vaginal lubrication.

In seemingly rare cases, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been reported to cause a long-lasting iatrogenic disorder known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, the symptoms of which include reduced vaginal lubrication in females.

Vaginal dryness affects 3-43% of women, and it is more common after menopause. Post-menopausal women produce less vaginal lubrication and reduced estrogen levels may be associated with increased vaginal dryness.

==Management strategies==

Hormonal

Estrogen treatments are considered the gold standard for managing vaginal dryness. They are available in systemic and vaginal forms, with systemic estrogen addressing multiple issues such as vasomotor symptoms and osteoporosis, albeit with a higher risk profile. Vaginal estrogen, which includes creams, pills, rings, and inserts, is more commonly prescribed due to its lower risk. DHEA (prasterone) is a promising alternative that enhances vaginal health with minimal side effects and does not significantly alter hormone levels. Testosterone therapy is also an option, though it is off-label and lacks FDA-approved formulations, with limited data on its efficacy and safety.

Non-Hormonal

The treatment of vaginal dryness includes over-the-counter (OTC) options of vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, non-estrogenic prescription treatments, laser and ultrasound devices, as well as lifestyle changes. Non-hormonal vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, which have minimal side effects and are easy to obtain, are the primary recommendation, especially for those contraindicated for hormone treatments. They aim to mimic natural vaginal conditions and provide temporary relief during intercourse, while regular use of moisturizers helps maintain moisture. Prescription treatments include non-estrogenic options for women who can&#x27;t use estrogen. Ospemifene is a notable FDA-approved medication for vaginal dryness and discomfort, although concerns about long-term safety remain. Vaginal laser therapy and ultrasound devices are emerging options, particularly for those who do not respond to traditional methods. While initial results appear promising, evidence for their long-term efficacy is still limited. Lifestyle modifications can also alleviate vaginal dryness; quitting smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and maintaining a healthy weight is beneficial. Additionally, regular sexual activity can enhance tissue health and moisture levels, further aiding in symptom relief.

==Dry sex==
Some people practice dry sex, which involves the removal of vaginal lubrication in some way. The rationale for the practice seems to be for cleansing purposes and to enhance the sexual pleasure of the penetrating partner. However, besides making sexual intercourse painful for the female, the practice is believed to increase the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted infections for both partners, such as HIV, with which the risk of transmission is increased by lacerations in the vaginal tissue resulting from the lack of lubrication.

<doc id="514534" wikidata="Q1366892" url="?curid=514534" title="Canonical transformation">
<text>In Hamiltonian mechanics, a canonical transformation is a change of canonical coordinates that preserves the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations. This is sometimes known as &quot;form invariance&quot;. Although Hamilton&#x27;s equations are preserved, it need not preserve the explicit form of the Hamiltonian itself. Canonical transformations are useful in their own right, and also form the basis for the Hamilton–Jacobi equations (a useful method for calculating conserved quantities) and Liouville&#x27;s theorem (itself the basis for classical statistical mechanics).

Since Lagrangian mechanics is based on generalized coordinates, transformations of the coordinates do not affect the form of Lagrange&#x27;s equations and, hence, do not affect the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations if the momentum is simultaneously changed by a Legendre transformation into
formula_1
where formula_2 are the new co‑ordinates, grouped in canonical conjugate pairs of momenta formula_3 and corresponding positions formula_4 for formula_5 with formula_6 being the number of degrees of freedom in both co‑ordinate systems.

Therefore, coordinate transformations (also called &quot;point transformations&quot;) are a &quot;type&quot; of canonical transformation. However, the class of canonical transformations is much broader, since the old generalized coordinates, momenta and even time may be combined to form the new generalized coordinates and momenta. Canonical transformations that do not include the time explicitly are called &quot;restricted canonical transformations&quot; (many textbooks consider only this type).

Modern mathematical descriptions of canonical transformations are considered under the broader topic of symplectomorphism which covers the subject with advanced mathematical prerequisites such as cotangent bundles, exterior derivatives and symplectic manifolds.

==Notation==
Boldface variables such as represent a list of generalized coordinates that need not transform like a vector under rotation and similarly represents the corresponding generalized momentum, e.g.,
formula_7

A dot over a variable or list signifies the time derivative, e.g.,
formula_8and the equalities are read to be satisfied for all coordinates, for example:formula_9

The dot product notation between two lists of the same number of coordinates is a shorthand for the sum of the products of corresponding components, e.g.,
formula_10

The dot product (also known as an &quot;inner product&quot;) maps the two coordinate lists into one variable representing a single numerical value. The coordinates after transformation are similarly labelled with for transformed generalized coordinates and for transformed generalized momentum.

== Conditions for restricted canonical transformation ==
Restricted canonical transformations are coordinate transformations where transformed coordinates and do not have explicit time dependence, i.e., formula_11 and formula_12. The functional form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations isformula_13
In general, a transformation does not preserve the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations but in the absence of time dependence in transformation, some simplifications are possible. Following the formal definition for a canonical transformation, it can be shown that for this type of transformation, the new Hamiltonian (sometimes called the Kamiltonian) can be expressed as:formula_14where it differs by a partial time derivative of a function known as a generator, which reduces to being only a function of time for restricted canonical transformations. 

In addition to leaving the form of the Hamiltonian unchanged, it is also permits the use of the unchanged Hamiltonian in the Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion due to the above form as:

formula_15

Although canonical transformations refers to a more general set of transformations of phase space corresponding with less permissive transformations of the Hamiltonian, it provides simpler conditions to obtain results that can be further generalized. All of the following conditions, with the exception of bilinear invariance condition, can be generalized for canonical transformations, including time dependance.

=== Indirect conditions ===
Since restricted transformations have no explicit time dependence (by definition), the time derivative of a new generalized coordinate is

formula_16
where is the Poisson bracket.
Similarly for the identity for the conjugate momentum, &quot;Pm&quot; using the form of the &quot;Kamiltonian&quot; it follows that:

formula_17
Due to the form of the Hamiltonian equations of motion,

formula_18

if the transformation is canonical, the two derived results must be equal, resulting in the equations:
formula_19

The analogous argument for the generalized momenta &quot;Pm&quot; leads to two other sets of equations:
formula_20

These are the indirect conditions to check whether a given transformation is canonical.

=== Symplectic condition ===
Sometimes the Hamiltonian relations are represented as:

formula_21

Where formula_22 

and formula_23. Similarly, let formula_24.

From the relation of partial derivatives, converting the formula_25 relation in terms of partial derivatives with new variables gives formula_26 where formula_27. Similarly for formula_28,

formula_29
Due to form of the Hamiltonian equations for formula_28,

formula_31
where formula_32 can be used due to the form of Kamiltonian. Equating the two equations gives the symplectic condition as:

formula_33The left hand side of the above is called the Poisson matrix of formula_34, denoted as formula_35. Similarly, a Lagrange matrix of formula_36 can be constructed as formula_37. It can be shown that the symplectic condition is also equivalent to formula_38 by using the formula_39 property. The set of all matrices formula_40 which satisfy symplectic conditions form a symplectic group. The symplectic conditions are equivalent with indirect conditions as they both lead to the equation formula_41, which is used in both of the derivations.

=== Invariance of the Poisson bracket ===
The Poisson bracket which is defined as:formula_42can be represented in matrix form as:formula_43Hence using partial derivative relations and symplectic condition gives:formula_44

The symplectic condition can also be recovered by taking formula_45 and formula_46 which shows that formula_47. Thus these conditions are equivalent to symplectic conditions. Furthermore, it can be seen that formula_48, which is also the result of explicitly calculating the matrix element by expanding it. 

=== Invariance of the Lagrange bracket ===
The Lagrange bracket which is defined as:

formula_49

can be represented in matrix form as:

formula_50

Using similar derivation, gives:

formula_51The symplectic condition can also be recovered by taking formula_52 and formula_53 which shows that formula_54. Thus these conditions are equivalent to symplectic conditions. Furthermore, it can be seen that formula_55, which is also the result of explicitly calculating the matrix element by expanding it.

=== Bilinear invariance conditions ===
These set of conditions only apply to restricted canonical transformations or canonical transformations that are independent of time variable.

Consider arbitrary variations of two kinds, in a single pair of generalized coordinate and the corresponding momentum:

formula_56
The area of the infinitesimal parallelogram is given by:

formula_57
It follows from the formula_38 symplectic condition that the infinitesimal area is conserved under canonical transformation:

formula_59

Note that the new coordinates need not be completely oriented in one coordinate momentum plane.

Hence, the condition is more generally stated as an invariance of the form formula_60 under canonical transformation, expanded as:formula_61If the above is obeyed for any arbitrary variations, it would be only possible if the indirect conditions are met. 
The form of the equation, formula_62 is also known as a symplectic product of the vectors formula_63 and formula_64 and the bilinear invariance condition can be stated as a local conservation of the symplectic product.

== Liouville&#x27;s theorem ==
The indirect conditions allow us to prove Liouville&#x27;s theorem, which states that the &quot;volume&quot; in phase space is conserved under canonical transformations, i.e.,
formula_65

By calculus, the latter integral must equal the former times the determinant of Jacobian formula_66Where formula_27
Exploiting the &quot;division&quot; property of Jacobians yieldsformula_68

Eliminating the repeated variables givesformula_69

Application of the indirect conditions above yields .

==Generating function approach==

To &quot;guarantee&quot; a valid transformation between and , we may resort to a direct generating function approach. Both sets of variables must obey Hamilton&#x27;s principle. That is the action integral over the Lagrangians formula_70 and formula_71, obtained from the respective Hamiltonian via an &quot;inverse&quot; Legendre transformation, must be stationary in both cases (so that one can use the Euler–Lagrange equations to arrive at Hamiltonian equations of motion of the designated form; as it is shown for example here):
formula_72

One way for both variational integral equalities to be satisfied is to have
formula_73

Lagrangians are not unique: one can always multiply by a constant and add a total time derivative and yield the same equations of motion (as ). In general, the scaling factor is set equal to one; canonical transformations for which are called extended canonical transformations. is kept, otherwise the problem would be rendered trivial and there would be not much freedom for the new canonical variables to differ from the old ones.

Here is a generating function of one old canonical coordinate ( or ), one new canonical coordinate ( or ) and (possibly) the time . Thus, there are four basic types of generating functions (although mixtures of these four types can exist), depending on the choice of variables. As will be shown below, the generating function will define a transformation from old to new canonical coordinates, and any such transformation is guaranteed to be canonical.

The various generating functions and its properties tabulated below is discussed in detail:
===Type 1 generating function===
The type 1 generating function depends only on the old and new generalized coordinates
formula_74
To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above
formula_75

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following equations must hold
formula_76

These equations define the transformation as follows: The &quot;first&quot; set of equations
formula_77
define relations between the new generalized coordinates and the old canonical coordinates . Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each as a function of the old canonical coordinates. Substitution of these formulae for the coordinates into the &quot;second&quot; set of equations
formula_78
yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta in terms of the old canonical coordinates . We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the &quot;old&quot; canonical coordinates as functions of the &quot;new&quot; canonical coordinates . Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
formula_79
yields a formula for as a function of the new canonical coordinates .

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple. For example, let 
formula_80
This results in swapping the generalized coordinates for the momenta and vice versa 
formula_81
and . This example illustrates how independent the coordinates and momenta are in the Hamiltonian formulation; they are equivalent variables.

===Type 2 generating function===
The type 2 generating function formula_82 depends only on the old generalized coordinates and the new generalized momenta
formula_83
where the formula_84 terms represent a Legendre transformation to change the right-hand side of the equation below. To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above
formula_85

Since the old coordinates and new momenta are each independent, the following equations must hold
formula_86

These equations define the transformation as follows: The &quot;first&quot; set of equations
formula_87
define relations between the new generalized momenta and the old canonical coordinates . Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each as a function of the old canonical coordinates. Substitution of these formulae for the coordinates into the &quot;second&quot; set of equations
formula_88
yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates in terms of the old canonical coordinates . We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the &quot;old&quot; canonical coordinates as functions of the &quot;new&quot; canonical coordinates . Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
formula_89
yields a formula for as a function of the new canonical coordinates .

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple. For example, let 
formula_90
where is a set of functions. This results in a point transformation of the generalized coordinates
formula_91

===Type 3 generating function===
The type 3 generating function formula_92 depends only on the old generalized momenta and the new generalized coordinates 
formula_93
where the formula_94 terms represent a Legendre transformation to change the left-hand side of the equation below. To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above
formula_95

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following equations must hold
formula_96

These equations define the transformation as follows: The &quot;first&quot; set of equations
formula_97
define relations between the new generalized coordinates and the old canonical coordinates . Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each as a function of the old canonical coordinates. Substitution of these formulae for the coordinates into the &quot;second&quot; set of equations
formula_98
yields analogous formulae for the new generalized momenta in terms of the old canonical coordinates . We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the &quot;old&quot; canonical coordinates as functions of the &quot;new&quot; canonical coordinates . Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation formula_99 yields a formula for as a function of the new canonical coordinates .

In practice, this procedure is easier than it sounds, because the generating function is usually simple.

===Type 4 generating function===
The type 4 generating function formula_100 depends only on the old and new generalized momenta
formula_101
where the formula_102 terms represent a Legendre transformation to change both sides of the equation below. To derive the implicit transformation, we expand the defining equation above
formula_103

Since the new and old coordinates are each independent, the following equations must hold
formula_104

These equations define the transformation as follows: The &quot;first&quot; set of equations
formula_105
define relations between the new generalized momenta and the old canonical coordinates . Ideally, one can invert these relations to obtain formulae for each as a function of the old canonical coordinates. Substitution of these formulae for the coordinates into the &quot;second&quot; set of equations
formula_106
yields analogous formulae for the new generalized coordinates in terms of the old canonical coordinates . We then invert both sets of formulae to obtain the &quot;old&quot; canonical coordinates as functions of the &quot;new&quot; canonical coordinates . Substitution of the inverted formulae into the final equation 
formula_107
yields a formula for as a function of the new canonical coordinates .

=== Limitations on the four types of generating functions ===
Considering formula_82 as an example, using generating function of second kind: formula_109 and formula_110, the first set of equations consisting of variables formula_111, formula_112 and formula_113 has to be inverted to get formula_114. This process is possible when the matrix defined by formula_115 is non-singular using the inverse function theorem, and can be restated as the following relation.

formula_116

Hence, restrictions are placed on generating functions to have the matrices: formula_117, formula_118, formula_119 and formula_120, being non-singular. These conditions also correspond to local invertibility of the coordinates. From these restrictions, it can be stated that type 1 and type 4 generating functions always have a non-singular formula_121 matrix whereas type 2 and type 3 generating functions always have a non-singular formula_122 matrix. Hence, the canonical transformations resulting from these four generating functions alone are not completely general.

=== Generalized use of generating functions ===

In other words, since and are each independent functions, it follows that to have generating function of the form formula_123 and formula_100 or formula_82 and formula_92, the corresponding Jacobian matrices formula_127 and formula_128 are restricted to be non singular, ensuring that the generating function is a function of independent variables. However, as a feature of canonical transformations, it is always possible to choose such independent functions from sets or , to form a generating function representation of canonical transformations, including the time variable. Hence, it can be proven that every finite canonical transformation can be given as a closed but implicit form that is a variant of the given four simple forms.

== Canonical transformation conditions ==

=== Canonical transformation relations ===
From: formula_129, calculate formula_130:

formula_131

Since the left hand side is formula_132 which is independent of dynamics of the particles, equating coefficients of formula_133 and formula_134 to zero, canonical transformation rules are obtained. This step is equivalent to equating the left hand side as formula_135.

Similarly:

formula_136Similarly the canonical transformation rules are obtained by equating the left hand side as formula_137. 

The above two relations can be combined in matrix form as: formula_138 (which will also retain same form for extended canonical transformation) where the result formula_139, has been used. The canonical transformation relations are hence said to be equivalent to formula_138 in this context.
The canonical transformation relations can now be restated to include time dependance:formula_141formula_142Since formula_135 and formula_137, if and do not explicitly depend on time, formula_145 can be taken. The analysis of restricted canonical transformations is hence consistent with this generalization.

=== Symplectic condition ===
Applying transformation of co-ordinates formula for formula_146, in Hamiltonian&#x27;s equations gives:formula_147

Similarly for formula_28:formula_149or:formula_150Where the last terms of each equation cancel due to formula_138 condition from canonical transformations. Hence leaving the symplectic relation: formula_152 which is also equivalent with the condition formula_153. It follows from the above two equations that the symplectic condition implies the equation formula_138, from which the indirect conditions can be recovered. Thus, symplectic conditions and indirect conditions can be said to be equivalent in the context of using generating functions. 

=== Invariance of the Poisson and Lagrange brackets ===
Since formula_155 and formula_156 where the symplectic condition is used in the last equalities. Using formula_157, the equalities formula_158 and formula_159 are obtained which imply the invariance of Poisson and Lagrange brackets.

== Extended canonical transformation ==

=== Canonical transformation relations ===
By solving for:formula_73with various forms of generating function, the relation between K and H goes as formula_161 instead, which also applies for formula_162 case. 

All results presented below can also be obtained by replacing formula_163, formula_164 and formula_165 from known solutions, since it retains the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations. The extended canonical transformations are hence said to be result of a canonical transformation (formula_162) and a trivial canonical transformation (formula_167) which has formula_168 (for the given example, formula_169 which satisfies the condition).

Using same steps previously used in previous generalization, with formula_161 in the general case, and retaining the equation formula_171, extended canonical transformation partial differential relations are obtained as:formula_172formula_173

=== Symplectic condition ===
Following the same steps to derive the symplectic conditions, as: formula_147and 
formula_149
where using formula_161 instead gives:formula_177The second part of each equation cancel. Hence the condition for extended canonical transformation instead becomes: formula_168.

=== Poisson and Lagrange brackets ===
The Poisson brackets are changed as follows:formula_179whereas, the Lagrange brackets are changed as:

formula_180
Hence, the Poisson bracket scales by the inverse of formula_181 whereas the Lagrange bracket scales by a factor of formula_181.

== Infinitesimal canonical transformation ==
Consider the canonical transformation that depends on a continuous parameter formula_183, as follows:

formula_184

For infinitesimal values of formula_183, the corresponding transformations are called as &quot;infinitesimal canonical transformations&quot; which are also known as differential canonical transformations.

Consider the following generating function:

formula_186

Since for formula_187, formula_188 has the resulting canonical transformation, formula_189 and formula_190, this type of generating function can be used for infinitesimal canonical transformation by restricting formula_183 to an infinitesimal value. From the conditions of generators of second type:formula_192Since formula_193, changing the variables of the function formula_194 to formula_195 and neglecting terms of higher order of formula_183, gives:formula_197Infinitesimal canonical transformations can also be derived using the matrix form of the symplectic condition.

=== Active canonical transformations ===

In the passive view of transformations, the coordinate system is changed without the physical system changing, whereas in the active view of transformation, the coordinate system is retained and the physical system is said to undergo transformations. Thus, using the relations from infinitesimal canonical transformations, the change in the system states under active view of the canonical transformation is said to be:

formula_198
or as formula_199 in matrix form.
For any function formula_200, it changes under active view of the transformation according to:

formula_201

Considering the change of Hamiltonians in the active view, i.e., for a fixed point,formula_202where formula_203 are mapped to the point, formula_204 by the infinitesimal canonical transformation, and similar change of variables for formula_205 to formula_195 is considered up-to first order of formula_183. Hence, if the Hamiltonian is invariant for infinitesimal canonical transformations, its generator is a constant of motion.

=== Examples of ICT ===

==== Time evolution ====
Taking formula_208 and formula_209, then formula_210. Thus the continuous application of such a transformation maps the coordinates formula_211 to formula_212. Hence if the Hamiltonian is time translation invariant, i.e. does not have explicit time dependence, its value is conserved for the motion.

==== Translation ====
Taking formula_213, formula_214 and formula_215. Hence, the canonical momentum generates a shift in the corresponding generalized coordinate and if the Hamiltonian is invariant of translation, the momentum is a constant of motion.

==== Rotation ====
Consider an orthogonal system for an N-particle system:

formula_216

Choosing the generator to be: formula_217 and the infinitesimal value of formula_218, then the change in the coordinates is given for x by:

formula_219

and similarly for y:

formula_220

whereas the z component of all particles is unchanged: formula_221.

These transformations correspond to rotation about the z axis by angle formula_222 in its first order approximation. Hence, repeated application of the infinitesimal canonical transformation generates a rotation of system of particles about the z axis. If the Hamiltonian is invariant under rotation about the z axis, the generator, the component of angular momentum along the axis of rotation, is an invariant of motion.

== Motion as canonical transformation ==
Motion itself (or, equivalently, a shift in the time origin) is a canonical transformation. If formula_223 and formula_224, then Hamilton&#x27;s principle is automatically satisfiedformula_225since a valid trajectory formula_226 should always satisfy Hamilton&#x27;s principle, regardless of the endpoints.

== Examples ==
* The translation formula_227 where formula_228 are two constant vectors is a canonical transformation. Indeed, the Jacobian matrix is the identity, which is symplectic: formula_229.
* Set formula_230 and formula_231, the transformation formula_232 where formula_233 is a rotation matrix of order 2 is canonical. Keeping in mind that special orthogonal matrices obey formula_234 it&#x27;s easy to see that the Jacobian is symplectic. However, this example only works in dimension 2: formula_235 is the only special orthogonal group in which every matrix is symplectic. Note that the rotation here acts on formula_236 and not on formula_237 and formula_238 independently, so these are not the same as a physical rotation of an orthogonal spatial coordinate system.
* The transformation formula_239, where formula_240 is an arbitrary function of formula_238, is canonical. Jacobian matrix is indeed given by formula_242 which is symplectic.

==Modern mathematical description==
In mathematical terms, canonical coordinates are any coordinates on the phase space (cotangent bundle) of the system that allow the canonical one-form to be written as
formula_243
up to a total differential (exact form). The change of variable between one set of canonical coordinates and another is a canonical transformation. The index of the generalized coordinates is written here as a &quot;superscript&quot; (formula_244), not as a &quot;subscript&quot; as done above (formula_245). The superscript conveys the contravariant transformation properties of the generalized coordinates, and does &quot;not&quot; mean that the coordinate is being raised to a power. Further details may be found at the symplectomorphism article.

==History==
The first major application of the canonical transformation was in 1846, by Charles Delaunay, in the study of the Earth-Moon-Sun system. This work resulted in the publication of a pair of large volumes as &quot;Mémoires&quot; by the French Academy of Sciences, in 1860 and 1867.

<text>Huell Burnley Howser (October 18, 1945 – January 7, 2013) was an American television personality, actor, producer, writer, singer, and voice artist, best known for hosting, producing, and writing &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; and his human interest show &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;, produced by KCET in Los Angeles for California PBS stations. The archive of his video chronicles offers an enhanced understanding of the history, culture, and people of California. He also voiced the Backson in &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Howser was born in Gallatin, Tennessee, on October 18, 1945, to Harold Chamberlain and Jewell Havens (Burnley) Howser. Howser&#x27;s first name is a portmanteau of his parents&#x27; given names, Harold and Jewell, as Howser explained in the &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; episode &quot;Smartsville.&quot;

Howser graduated from the University School of Nashville in 1963, then studied history and political science at the University of Tennessee, where he served as student body president.

==Career==
After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve and on the staff of U.S. Senator Howard Baker, Howser began his television career at WSMV-TV in Nashville, Tennessee, where he produced shows focused on human interest stories, such as &quot;Happy Features&quot; and &quot;The Happy World of Huell Howser&quot;. Howser was also a television personality working for the University of Tennessee.

After working in New York City as the host of WCBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Real Life&quot; show, Howser moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1981 to work as a reporter for KCBS-TV. During 1982 and 1983, he served as weekend host and correspondent for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. In 1983, he joined KCET (then a PBS affiliate) as host and producer of &quot;Videolog&quot;, a series of brief human-interest segments running less than 10 minutes each, that aired in between the station&#x27;s shorter programs to fill up air time. &quot;Videolog&quot; eventually became one of the more popular programs on KCET, and in 1990, the show was expanded to half hour-long episodes. Included in Videolog was lint artist Slater Barron among other topics relevant to Los Angeles and adjacent communities.

===&quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot;===

In 1991, after spending his vacation driving across the Golden State and visiting with all 13 PBS stations in California, &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; premiered in April of that year. &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; highlights small towns, landmarks, events, or places of interest throughout California that are not well known to the general public. Howser conducted informal, often impromptu, interviews with locals involved with the sites he visited. He also produced &quot;California&#x27;s Communities&quot;, &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Fairs&quot;, &quot;Downtown&quot;, &quot;California&#x27;s Water&quot;, &quot;California&#x27;s Green&quot;, &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Coast&quot;, &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Parks&quot;, &quot;Road Trip&quot;, &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;, &quot;California Missions&quot;, &quot;Palm Springs&quot;, &quot;Our Neighborhoods&quot;, &quot;The Bench&quot;, and various specials.

===&quot;Visiting...with Huell Howser&quot;===

&quot;Visiting...with Huell Howser&quot; was a weekly PBS series hosted by Howser that originally aired from 1991 until his retirement in 2012 that focused on &quot;the diverse people, places, and events that make southern California such a unique community.&quot;

, KCET and other southern California PBS stations continue to rerun this popular series. Episodes can be viewed on demand on the web sites of Chapman University and select PBS affiliates. Randomly shuffled episodes can also be seen around the clock on KCET&#x27;s &quot;24/7 Huell Howser Live Stream&quot; YouTube channel.

===Other work===

Articles written by Howser appeared in &quot;Westways&quot;, the magazine of the Automobile Club of Southern California.

In 1997, he featured prominently as himself alongside Tracey Ullman in character as Ruby Romaine in the &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot; episode &quot;Hollywood.&quot;

Howser spearheaded an unsuccessful effort to stop the demolition of buildings designed by Paul Williams at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard.

He appeared in &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car?&quot; (2006) in his capacity as a reporter, witnessing the demolition and shredding of a Honda EV Plus.

In 2009, Howser appeared as himself in the twenty-first season Simpsons episode &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?&quot;, where he hosted Under the Wrapper, a program similar to Food Network&#x27;s Unwrapped. 

In 2011, Howser voiced the Backson in the post-credits scene of Walt Disney Animation Studios&#x27; feature film &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot;.

==Personal life==
Howser lived in the historic El Royale apartments in Los Angeles, California, in an apartment which had previously been home to character actor William Frawley. Howser also had homes in Palm Springs and Twentynine Palms.

On June 29, 2015, Howser&#x27;s Twentynine Palms home became available for rentals and weddings.

Howser mentioned that he was a Methodist during his episode covering the Nevada County Fair on &quot;California&#x27;s Golden Fairs&quot;.

===Volcano House===

In 2003, Howser purchased the Volcano House, situated on a volcanic cinder cone just outside Barstow in Newberry Springs, along with of desert and a man-made lake. In 2010, Howser put the unusual residence on the market for $650,000.

In June 2012, &quot;The Panther&quot;, a student-run newspaper for Chapman University, announced that Howser had donated the Volcano House to the school. On September 3, 2015, Chapman University sold the Volcano House for $750,000.

==Retirement and death==
On November 27, 2012, &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; reported that Howser was retiring from making new shows, amid speculation in the television community that he was seriously ill.

On January 7, 2013 at 2:35 AM, Howser died at his Palm Springs home, at the age of 67. He had been battling cancer for several years and his death certificate listed metastatic prostate cancer as the cause. Howser&#x27;s body was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea off the coast of Los Angeles County.

On January 15, 2013, a memorial was held for Howser, who said before his death that he did not want a funeral as he did not want attention.

==Legacy==

Howser donated his videotaped collection of &quot;California&#x27;s Gold&quot; episodes, as well as those of his other series, to Chapman University in 2011. He also donated his personal papers, and a large collection of books on California history to the university. The school established the Huell Howser Archives, which, when completed, will offer the public free access to the entire digitized collection of his life&#x27;s work. The archives can be accessed at Chapman University as well as on the internet. He also gave his extensive art collection, which consists mostly of &quot;found-object&quot; art collected during his travels, to the university, and endowed the California&#x27;s Gold Scholarship Fund. Upon his death he bequeathed his remaining two homes to the university, the proceeds from the sale of which will be added to the scholarship fund.

Testimonials to Howser&#x27;s unique contribution to the celebration of California history and culture were acknowledged in numerous media sources upon word of his death. Gustavo Arellano, then-editor of the &quot;OC Weekly&quot;, called Howser &quot;the greatest Californian since Hiram Johnson,&quot; noting that for Howser, &quot;California was the ultimate temple of the American dream.&quot; This reflects the high regard in which many Californians hold Howser&#x27;s unabashedly enthusiastic promotion of their state&#x27;s heritage.

In 2015, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

==In popular culture==
Howser&#x27;s enthusiastic style as host of his various travel shows led to him being impersonated and lampooned by comedians and radio personalities, such as Adam Carolla, Dana Gould, Ralph Garman, and James Adomian.

Matt Groening has stated he is a fan of Howser and featured him in two episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Marrying,&quot; in which a character named Howell Huser (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) falls off a turnip truck, and &quot;O Brother, Where Bart Thou?,&quot; in which the real Howser presents a program similar to Marc Summers&#x27; &quot;Unwrapped&quot; television program titled &quot;Under the Wrapper&quot;. Howser received a voice credit for the episode. The &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Test Before Trying&quot; commemorated his death with a quick cartoon memorial shot at the end of the episode, stating: &quot;In Memory of Huell Howser, Friend of the Simpsons and a friend of California.&quot;

<doc id="514538" wikidata="Q2607804" url="?curid=514538" title="Champion (supermarket)">
<text>Champion was a French supermarket chain and owned by the international retailer Carrefour. There were also Champion supermarkets in Belgium, Spain, Poland, Greece, Turkey, Argentina and Brazil.
Champion was the second-largest supermarket chain in France in 2008, achieving an annual turnover of €12.2 billion. The chain operated more than 1,000 stores and employed 60,000 people.

In Belgium, the Champion brand was managed by the Mestdagh Group, with most locations situated in Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region. Flanders had three Champion locations, specifically in Aarschot, Sint-Truiden, and Tienen.&lt;br&gt;
As of September 2013, all Champion stores were rebranded as Carrefour Market, under the brand name &quot;Carrefour Market-Mestdagh Group&quot;.

==History==
In 1993, Champion became the main sponsor of the polka dot jersey in the Tour de France until 2008. From 2009, Carrefour took over the sponsorship.

In 1999, Champion is taken over by the Carrefour Group after the fusion of Promodès and Champion grows by absorbing the Stoc chain.

In 2006, Carrefour closed most Brazilian Champion stores and rebranded the remainder to the Carrefour Bairro. Also, all Spanish and Turkish Champion supermarkets were rebranded as Carrefour Express in 2006; some of them became Maxi DIA.

In 2008, Champion was the second largest supermarket chain in France, its annual turnover was €13.5bn. There were over 1,000 stores and 45,000 employees.

In 2008, it was announced that most stores would be rebranded to Carrefour Market between September 2008 and October 2009.

In 2009, there were 135 supermarkets, in 2011 there were less than 100 stores.

By 2013, only two Champion stores were left in European France (excluding French overseas islands), in Paris (18th arrondissement) and in Pouzac. In 2018, after a legal battle filed against Carrefour was concluded, the last remaining (Paris) store was also rebranded, marking the end of the &quot;Champion&quot; supermarket brand in Europe.

=== Champion in Belgium ===
In Belgium, the Champion stores are owned by Carrefour and Groupe Mestdagh. In 2009, there were 67 Champion stores. From 2013, it was decided by Carrefour that most Champion stores in Belgium would be rebranded as &quot;Carrefour Market-Groupe Mestdagh&quot;.

As of July 2013, there are 21 stores were left; 7 in Hainaut, 5 in Namur, 4 in Liège, 3 in Walloon Brabant, 1 in Limburg and Luxembourg. The rebranding was complete the following year (2014) when the last single remaining Champion store in Wallonia was renamed Carrefour.

<doc id="514539" wikidata="Q3819936" url="?curid=514539" title="The Eleventh Hour (Canadian TV series)">
<text>The Eleventh Hour is a Canadian television drama series which aired weekly on CTV from 2002 to 2005.

The show revolves around the reporters and producers at a fictional television news magazine series, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. Unhappy with the newsmagazine&#x27;s shrinking audience, the network has brought in a new executive producer, Kennedy Marsh, to reorient the show in a more ratings-driven tabloid journalism direction.

The tension between the ratings imperative and the more traditional journalistic ethics of the show&#x27;s senior staff is the primary conflict that drives the show, but storylines also include the team&#x27;s efforts to get the stories that will make it to air each week.

&quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; was produced by Alliance Atlantis, Canada&#x27;s largest film and television production house. It aired in the U.S. on Sleuth, under the title Bury the Lead, to distinguish it from a CBS series with a similar name.

==Ratings==

Although the show started off poorly in the Canadian television ratings, attracting an average of just 400,000 viewers each week, its audience during the start of its 2004 season was sufficiently high that CTV ordered a third season. However, ratings did not improve further. The third season, already ordered, aired irregularly on Saturday nights with very little promotion, and proved to be its last. The final season also received a &quot;Best Dramatic Series&quot; Gemini Award despite the cancellation.

&quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; was the latest in a lengthy line of drama series at CTV which had high-profile launches but were quickly marginalized to little-watched weekend timeslots and ultimately cancelled. However, it outlasted several other recent CTV dramas, including &quot;Power Play&quot;, &quot;The City&quot;, and &quot;The Associates&quot;, which each lasted two seasons.

The show&#x27;s theme song for season 3 is &quot;Weapon&quot;, by Matthew Good.

<text>μClinux is a variation of the Linux kernel, previously maintained as a fork, that targets microcontrollers without a memory management unit (MMU). It was integrated into the mainline kernel as of 2.5.46; the project continues to develop patches and tools for microcontrollers. The homepage lists Linux kernel releases for 2.0, 2.4 and 2.6 (all of which are end-of-life in mainline).

The letters &quot;μC&quot; are for &quot;microcontroller&quot;: the name is pronounced &quot;you-see-Linux&quot;, rather than pronouncing the letter mu as in Greek.

== History ==
μClinux was originally created by D. Jeff Dionne and Kenneth Albanowski in 1998. Initially, they targeted the Motorola DragonBall family of embedded 68k processors (specifically the 68EZ328 series used in the 3Com PalmPilot) on a 2.0.33 Linux kernel. After releasing their initial work, a developer community quickly sprang up extending their work to newer kernels and other microprocessor architectures. In early 1999, support was added for the Motorola (now NXP) ColdFire family of embedded microprocessors. ARM processor support was added later.

Although originally targeting 2.0 series Linux kernels, it now has ports based on Linux 2.4 and Linux 2.6. The Linux 2.4 ports were forward ported from the 2.0.36 Linux kernel by Michael Leslie and Evan Stawnyczy during their work at Rt-Control. There were never any μClinux extensions applied to the 2.2 series kernels.

Since version 2.5.46 of the Linux kernel, the major parts of μClinux have been integrated with the mainline kernel for a number of processor architectures.

Greg Ungerer (who originally ported μClinux to the Motorola ColdFire family of processors) continued to maintain and actively push core μClinux support into the 2.6 series Linux kernels. In this regard, μClinux is essentially no longer a separate fork of Linux.

μClinux had support for many architectures, and forms the basis of many products, like network routers, security cameras, DVD or MP3 players, VoIP phone or gateways, scanners, and card readers.

Support for several of the original target architectures was dropped in 2018. The obsolete CPU architectures set to be removed in Linux 4.17 and subsequent releases included ADI Blackfin, Etrax CRIS, Fujitsu FR-V, Mitsubishi M32R, Matsushita/Panasonic MN10300, Imagination META (Metag), and Tilera TILE.

===Hardware projects===
The leanXCam was an open-source programmable smart camera used for industrial applications in the field of machine vision that ran under μClinux; the camera won an award at the 2008 VISION tradeshow. As of 2015, the project was discontinued.

== Supported architectures ==
The current list includes:
* Altera Nios/Nios II
* Amber (open FPGA core)
* ARM ARM7TDMI, ARM Cortex-M3/M4/M7, ARM Cortex-R
* Lattice Mico32
* NXP 680x0 (Motorola/Freescale 680x0)
* Hyperstone E1/E2 (called hyLinux)
* Intel i960
* MIPS
* NXP ColdFire (Motorola/Freescale ColdFire)
* Xilinx MicroBlaze

=== No longer supported ===
* NEC V850E - removed in Linux 2.6.27.
* Hitachi/Renesas H8 (h8300) - removed in Linux 5.19.

Before Linux 4.17 the following architectures were also supported:
* ADI Blackfin (blackfin)
* Axis ETRAX (cris)
* Fujitsu FR-V (frv)
* Mitsubishi/Renesas M32R (m32r)

<text>The Equality Party () was a political party in Quebec, Canada, that promoted the use of English in Quebec on an equal basis with French. Four Equality Party members were elected to Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly in 1989, as part of an anglophone reaction to changes made by the governing Liberals to Quebec&#x27;s language law. The party had no success in subsequent elections, and stopped organizing after the 2003 Quebec election.

==History==

=== Foundation to 1989 election ===
The party was formed in 1989 as a reaction to then-Premier Robert Bourassa invoking the &quot;Notwithstanding clause&quot; of the Canadian constitution to override a Supreme Court ruling overturning parts of the Charter of the French Language (commonly known as &quot;Bill 101&quot;). The court ruling would have allowed languages other than French to appear on store signs and outdoor advertising; the government instead allowed other languages only on small signs inside shops. Another issue that fed Equality Party support was the Quebec Liberal Party&#x27;s forcing anglophone Members of the Quebec National Assembly (MNAs) to condemn a report from the Official Languages Commissioner suggesting Quebec anglophones felt &quot;humiliated&quot; by laws such as Bill 101.

The Equality Party&#x27;s platform called for equality of both languages (French and English) in Quebec, opposing Bill 101 which made French the sole official language of Quebec, imposed restrictions on the use of English on public signs, and required children to attend school in French unless one of their parents went to school in English in Canada. The Equality Party drew virtually all of its support from elements of Quebec&#x27;s anglophone minority, and only ran candidates in electoral districts with very high anglophone populations.

The party first came to prominence in the 1989 general election, when it won four seats on Montreal Island in the National Assembly with 3.7% of the popular vote. Along with its then-sister party, the Unity Party (which ran candidates outside the Montreal Island), it won 4.7% of the provincial popular vote. The winning candidates were Gordon Atkinson, Neil Cameron, Richard Holden and party leader Robert Libman, who won popular votes ranging from 41 percent to 58 percent in their respective ridings.

=== In the National Assembly 1989-1994 ===
The party did not receive official party status in Quebec&#x27;s National Assembly, being eight members short of the required twelve necessary for recognition, nor had they received 20% of the popular vote which would have otherwise qualified them for official status. The Liberals and Parti Quebecois agreed that the Equality Party caucus would receive some of the privileges of an &quot;official party&quot;, including having their members&#x27; seats in the National Assembly placed together and office space allocated close to each other, as well as some research funding; however, they were not allocated a guaranteed number of questions in the National Assembly&#x27;s daily Question Period, meaning that their opportunity to speak was left to the Speaker&#x27;s discretion. (This arrangement was repeated in later elections when Action démocratique du Québec won fewer seats in the National Assembly than required for official status).

The four members took an active role in National Assembly debates, most notably when Party leader Robert Libman made headlines by using his parliamentary privilege to reveal the details of confidential, money-losing contracts signed between Hydro-Québec and some of Quebec&#x27;s aluminum producers.

The party voted against Bill 150, a law providing for a referendum on sovereignty for Quebec, (which was later cancelled in favour of a referendum on the Charlottetown Accord).

The Unity Party merged with the Equality Party on May 7, 1990, increasing the party&#x27;s membership to what the party reported as 16,000. The party&#x27;s published financial statements, however, reported that only $7795 in membership dues were collected in 1990, down 75% from 1989 and enough to account for only 1,559 dues-paying members.

From 1990 onward, the party suffered from frequent and public infighting, clashing over personalities and over issues such as whether to support the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord. This peaked when Richard Holden, Equality MNA for the overwhelmingly Anglophone Westmount riding, left the party and eventually defected to the Parti Québécois, a party which had little support in Westmount due to its support of Bill 101 and Quebec independence.
Three of the Equality Party&#x27;s four elected members, including Libman, the party&#x27;s leader, quit the party before the next election.

In addition to the infighting and defections, the Equality Party&#x27;s &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; arguably vanished when the government amended the Charter of the French Language in 1993 to allow for more prominent English language text on commercial signs, so that the law no longer needed the use of the &quot;notwithstanding clause&quot; to withstand constitutional challenge. 
Furthermore, opinion polls prior to the 1994 election showed a close race between the two largest parties (the Liberals and the Parti Québécois), with the PQ explicitly promising an independence referendum if it was victorious. All of these factors encouraged Equality Party voters from 1989 to switch their support back to the Liberals in 1994.

=== Post-1994 activities ===
The Equality Party never repeated its electoral success of 1989. Cameron, the party&#x27;s sole remaining MNA, was defeated in the 1994 general election. Two subsequent general elections in 1998 and 2003 did nothing to improve the party&#x27;s fortunes.

The party continued to exist for another decade in a desultory fashion. Its remaining members held meetings, maintained a website and ran candidates for office until 2003. During these years, the party promoted political positions such as the reversal of the 2002 municipal mergers on the island of Montreal. Following the party&#x27;s poor showing in the 2003 election, its leader, Keith Henderson, announced he would resign once a new leader was chosen, which never occurred. The party stopped holding meetings, updating its website or running candidates in elections, but continued to file annual reports with the Director General of Elections until it was removed from the list of registered political parties at the end of 2012.

In 2013, a group attempted to restart the party under the name of &quot;Equality Party 2.0 - Parti Égalité 2.0&quot;, but abandoned efforts due to lack of support.

<doc id="514571" wikidata="Q3586425" url="?curid=514571" title="1998 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1998 Quebec general election was held on November 30, 1998, to elect members of the National Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Parti Québécois, led by Premier Lucien Bouchard, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Charest. To date this is the last election where the Parti Québécois won a majority of seats in the Quebec Assembly, although not the last in which it formed a government.

After the narrow defeat of the PQ&#x27;s proposal for political independence for Quebec in an economic union with the rest of Canada in the 1995 Quebec referendum, PQ leader Jacques Parizeau resigned. In January 1996, Bouchard left federal politics, where he was leader of the Bloc Québécois in the House of Commons of Canada, to lead the Parti Québécois and become premier.

Jean Charest had also left federal politics, where he had been leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Charest was initially seen as a bad fit for the Quebec Liberal Party, and for provincial politics. He later overcame this perception.

In terms of the number of seats won by each of the two parties, the result was almost identical to the previous 1994 general election. However, this time the Liberals won a slightly larger percentage of the popular vote, but nonetheless far fewer seats.

Mario Dumont, leader of the Action démocratique du Québec, repeated his success in winning his own seat, as he had done in the 1994 general election. However, his party also repeated its failure to elect any other member apart from its leader.

<text>The 1994 Quebec general election was held on September 12, 1994, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec. The Parti Québécois, led by Jacques Parizeau, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Premier Daniel Johnson Jr.

Johnson had succeeded Robert Bourassa as Liberal leader and Premier. Both his father, Daniel Sr., and brother, Pierre-Marc, had previously served as premiers of Quebec as leaders of different parties.

The election set the stage for the 1995 Quebec referendum on independence for Quebec from Canada. The referendum would see the PQ government&#x27;s proposals for sovereignty very narrowly defeated.

Mario Dumont, a former president of the Liberal party&#x27;s youth wing, and then leader of the newly formed Action démocratique du Québec, won his own seat, but no other members of his party were elected.

In Saint-Jean, there was a tie between incumbent Liberal candidate Michel Charbonneau and PQ candidate Roger Paquin. A new election was held on October 24 and was won by Paquin by a margin of 532 votes.

==1992 redistribution of ridings==
The &quot;Commission de la représentation électorale&quot; performed a redistribution in 1992, which maintained the number of seats in the National Assembly at 125 for the next general election, making the following alterations:

<text>Table Mountain pine, Pinus pungens, also called hickory pine, prickly pine, or mountain pine, is a small pine native to the Appalachian Mountains in the United States.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; is a tree of modest size (), and has a rounded, irregular shape. The needles are in bundles of two, occasionally three, yellow-green to mid green, fairly stout, and long. The pollen is released early compared to other pines in the area which minimizes hybridization. The cones are very short-stalked (almost sessile), ovoid, pale pinkish to yellowish buff, and long; each scale bears a stout, sharp spine long. Sapling trees can bear cones in as little as 5 years.

Buds ovoid to cylindric, red-brown, , resinous.

=== Morphology ===
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; is a native, slow-growing conifer. It is often small in stature and exceedingly limby. It rarely grows beyond 66 feet (20 m) tall, though the tallest individual recorded was 95 feet (29 m). &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; is typically around diameter at breast height (DBH). The maximum recorded DBH was . The trunks of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; are often crooked and have irregularly shaped cross-sections. Older trees tend to be flat-topped, while young trees can vary in form from that of a large bush when open-grown, to slender with relatively small limbs when grown in a dense stand. Table Mountain pine typically has long, thick limbs on much of the trunk even in closed canopy stands.

Male cones are long. Female cones are sessile and range from long. Cone scales are tough and armed with broad, upwardly curving spines.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; was described by British botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert (1761–1842) in 1805.

== Distribution and habitat ==

=== Distribution ===
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; distribution is centered in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States, primarily in the Blue Ridge and Valley-and-Ridge provinces of the Appalachian Highlands. Its range extends from central Pennsylvania, southwest to eastern West Virginia and southward into North Carolina, Tennessee, and the extreme northeast corner of Georgia. There are outlying populations of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; to the east of the Appalachians in the piedmont often on isolated peaks and monadnocks

=== Habitat ===
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; prefers dry conditions and is mostly found on rocky slopes and peaks, favoring higher elevations averaging of ~300-1700 meters.

== Ecology ==

&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; prefers dry conditions and is mostly found on rocky slopes, rocky knobs, and peaks, favoring higher elevations, from altitude. It commonly grows as single scattered trees or small groves, not in large forests like most other pines, and needs periodic disturbances for seedling establishment. Throughout the Appalachian Mountain range, &quot;P. pungens&quot; is a component of conifer-dominated communities along combination with other pine species. The three tallest known &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; are in Paris Mountain State Park, South Carolina; they are tall.

== Fire ecology ==
Fire histories developed for two &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; communities in southwestern Virginia revealed that between 1758 and 1944, fires burned approximately every 5 to 10 years during the dormant season. Lack of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; and increasing dominance of trees belonging to the Fagaceae (Oaks &amp; Beeches) appear to coincide with fire exclusion practices initiated after 1950 resulting in a lack of regeneration.

=== Fire adaptations ===
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; has adaptations to fire that are consistent with both long- and short-return-interval fire regimes. Medium-thick to thick bark, a large rooting habit, self sufficient self-pruning limbs, and pitch/sap production to seal wounds are characteristics of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; that suggest it is adapted to survive frequent, low-severity fire up to medium intensity fire. One major adaptation of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; to fire are the long dormant serotinous cones that open and spread seeds after high heat exposure.

=== Fire regime ===
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; was historically subject to a full range of fire frequencies and types: frequent low-severity surface fires, mixed-severity fires, and stand-replacement fires. Fire occurs infrequently on contemporary Appalachian landscapes where &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; is common.

Current age structure of &quot;Pinus pungens&quot; suggest fire is an important influence on stand structure and regeneration as it regulates and clears the land periodically. This can be seen in areas of the Chattahoochee National Forest, Georgia where large Table Mountain pines have not regenerated due to lack of needed conditions to rejuvenate both the soil and trees. Large gaps in year tree classes are the result of fire suppression.

== Conservation status ==
&quot;Pinus pungens&quot; is considered secure in Virginia and apparently secure in North Carolina, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. Its considered Vulnerable in Georgia, Critically Imperiled in New Jersey, and Exotic in Illinois.

<text>The 1989 Quebec general election was held on September 25, 1989, to elect members of the National Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Premier Robert Bourassa, won re-election, defeating the Parti Québécois, led by Jacques Parizeau.

This election was notable for the arrival of the Equality Party, which advocated English-speaking minority rights. It won four seats, but never had any success in any subsequent election.

The &quot;Commission de la représentation électorale&quot; performed a redistribution in 1988, which increased the number of seats in the National Assembly from 122 to 125 for the next general election:

<text>The 1985 Quebec general election was held on December 2, 1985, to elect members of the National Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by former premier Robert Bourassa, defeated the incumbent Parti Québécois, led by Premier Pierre-Marc Johnson.

This election marked the comeback of Robert Bourassa, whose political career had been thought to be over after losing the 1976 general election and resigning as Liberal leader. However, Bourassa personally failed to win his own seat in the Bertrand electoral district, and had to run in a by-election one month later in the safe Saint-Laurent electoral district. The 1985 Quebec general election result produced by far the largest majority of any Canadian legislative election (in terms of the number of seats) by a winning party whose leader failed to win his own seat. It was also the only modern election in Quebec history where the leader of the winning party lost their seat.

Johnson, son of former Union Nationale premier Daniel Johnson Sr. was unable to revive the PQ&#x27;s fortune after he succeeded René Lévesque as party leader and premier. Pierre-Marc&#x27;s brother, Daniel Johnson Jr., later became leader of the Liberal Party and briefly served as premier.

This election was the last contested by the Union Nationale. It only ran candidates in 19 ridings, none of whom came close to being elected. The party would be wound up by election authorities in 1989. It is also the last Quebec general election to date where the largest party won a majority government while also getting over 50% of the popular vote.

<text>The 1981 Quebec general election was held on April 13, 1981, to elect members of the National Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;, led by Premier René Lévesque, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Claude Ryan.

The PQ won re-election despite having lost the 1980 Quebec referendum on sovereignty-association, the party&#x27;s proposal for political independence for Quebec in an economic union with the rest of Canada. To some extent, they were helped by Claude Ryan&#x27;s old-fashioned campaign style: he refused to tailor sound bites for the evening news and ran a campaign generally unsuited for television coverage. Despite finishing only three percent behind the PQ, the Liberals still finished a distant second, with 42 seats to the PQ&#x27;s 80. Historically, provincial elections in Quebec produce large disparities between the popular vote and the actual seat count.

The Union Nationale, which had won 11 seats in a modest comeback in the 1976 general election, was reduced to five seats at dissolution by numerous floor crossings, retirements and resignations. Among the departures was that of its leader in the 1976 election, Rodrigue Biron, who crossed the floor to the PQ. The once-proud party lost all of its remaining seats, never to return. The party essentially ended at this point, though it lingered in desultory fashion until 1989.

==Redistribution of ridings==
A 1979 Act provided for the creation of the &quot;Commission de la représentation électorale&quot;, charged with the task of the redistribution of riding boundaries for elections to the National Assembly. For its initial work, it had to create a sufficient number of ridings that would have an average of 34,000 electors. In April 1980, the Commission increased the number of electoral districts from 110 to 122, effective with the next election:


==Campaign==
The Liberals and &quot;péquistes&quot; fielded full slates, while the Unionists decided not to run a candidate in the new riding of Ungava. The &quot;Parti national populaire&quot; ceased operations after its co-founder and only MNA Fabien Roy decided to leave the Legislature in 1979 for the federal level to lead the Social Credit Party of Canada.

The &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; dissolved in 1978 when its leader Camil Samson created &quot;Les Démocrates&quot;, but that party failed to secure enough nominations for the coming election and thus dissolved in 1980. Samson would later join the Liberals, and would run as a candidate for that party in Rouyn-Noranda–Témiscamingue.

Other disaffected &quot;créditistes&quot; opted to join the United Social Credit which had been revived by Jean-Paul Poulin.

==Results==
All seats were won by either the PQ or the Liberals, and no other party received better than a third-place result. The UN was once more shut out of the National Assembly. The election was notable for a large number of fringe parties, none of which received as much as 0.2% of the popular vote.

<text>Pinus densiflora, also called the Japanese red pine, the Japanese pine, or Korean red pine, is a species of pine tree native to East Asia and Siberia. In China, the plant is known as 赤松 (pinyin: chì sōng, literally &quot;red pine&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;P. densiflora&quot; has a home range that includes Japan, the Korean Peninsula, northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong and northeastern Jiangsu) and the extreme southeast of Russia (in Siberia, southern Primorsky Krai). 

==Description==
The leaves are needle-like, long, with two per fascicle. The short leaves are 5–6 cm. There are stomatal lines on both sides of the leaf, two vascular bundles, about three to nine resin canals, and fine serrations on the edge of the leaf. Branchlets with more or less white powder. Male cones are light reddish yellow, clustered in the lower part of new branches, female cones are light reddish purple, solitary or clustered in two to three clusters. The cones are dark brown yellow or light brown yellow when mature, they dehiscent at maturity, seed scales usually thin, seed winged. The bark is orange-red, cracked into irregular scale-like pieces. Heartwood reddish brown, sapwood light reddish yellow. The height of the tree is . The crown can reach . 

&quot;The distribution of &quot;P. densiflora&quot; in China has the following pattern of variation: the more northward it is distributed, the needles are relatively shorter, the white powder on the branchlets is sometimes less obvious or partly obvious, and the color of the cones is lighter. It is light brown yellow&quot;.

The cones are long. It is closely related to Scots pine, differing in the longer, slenderer leaves which are mid-green without the glaucous-blue tone of Scots pine. This pine has become a popular ornamental and has several cultivars, but in the winter it becomes yellowish. The plant prefers full sun on well-drained, slightly acidic soil.

==Uses==
Strong wind resistance, &quot;P. densiflora&quot; is an excellent tree species for afforestation in stony mountains, barren soil and sandy land. The timber can be used for construction, electric poles, sleepers, ore pillars, furniture, and wood fiber industrial raw materials. The trunk is rich in resin, from which rosin and turpentine can be extracted. Essential oil can be extracted from the leaves. In northeast China, matsutake relies on &quot;P. densiflora&quot; for growth. &quot;Jilin Tianfozhishan National Nature Reserve/Jilin Tianfozhishan National Nature Reserve&quot; takes &quot;Matsutake&quot;, &quot;P. densiflora&quot; and ecosystem as the main protection objects. &quot;P. densiflora&quot; wood has natural anti-corrosion and anti-mildew properties, and natural preservatives and natural wood anti-mold agents can be extracted. &quot;P. densiflora&quot; has non-stinging needles and soft branches, making it easy to shape as a penjing.

<doc id="514615" wikidata="Q1453010" url="?curid=514615" title="Frederick Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead">
<text>Frederick Winston Furneaux Smith, 2nd Earl of Birkenhead (7 December 1907 – 10 June 1975) was a British biographer and Member of the House of Lords. He is best known for writing a biography of Rudyard Kipling that was suppressed by the Kipling family for many years, and which he never lived to see in print.

==Background==
The son of F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead, he born in London and known was known as Viscount Furneaux from 1922, when his father, then 1st Viscount Birkenhead, was created Earl of Birkenhead. He had two sisters, Eleanor (1902–1945) and Pamela (1914–1982). Lord Furneaux was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He inherited his father&#x27;s peerages in 1930.

For the first three years of the Second World War, Lord Birkenhead served with a Territorial Army Anti-Tank unit. Following a course at the Staff College, Camberley, Major &quot;Freddy&quot; Birkenhead was assigned to the Foreign Office&#x27;s Political Intelligence Department, popularly known as the Political Warfare Executive, or PWE for short. He saw action in Croatia, as second-in-command of a sub-mission headed by Randolph Churchill, under Brigadier Fitzroy Maclean&#x27;s 37th Military Mission, which included Evelyn Waugh. As a result, he plays a prominent role in Waugh&#x27;s diaries.

==Career==
Lord Birkenhead served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Halifax (1938–1939), and as Lord-in-waiting to King George VI (1938–1940 and 1951–1952) and Queen Elizabeth II (1952–1955).

As a writer, Lord Birkenhead primarily authored political biographies, including books on Lord Cherwell and Lord Halifax. In the late 1940s, Lord Birkenhead was commissioned by Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s daughter Elsie Bambridge to write a biography of Kipling. An agreement with Lord Birkenhead gave Bambridge control over the contents, ownership of copyright, and two-thirds of any profits. Ultimately, Bambridge did not accept Lord Birkenhead&#x27;s work, and it remained unpublished through his death in 1975 and her death in 1976. The biography was finally published in 1978 with the agreement of Bambridge&#x27;s heirs.

==Personal life and death==
In 1935, he married The Hon Sheila Berry (1913–1992), second daughter of the 1st Viscount Camrose. The couple had a son, Frederick William Robin Smith, 3rd Earl of Birkenhead, in 1936 and a daughter, Lady Juliet Margaret Smith (later Lady Juliet Townsend), in 1941. Lady Juliet served as Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret from 1965 to 2002; her daughter Eleanor Townsend is a god-child of the Princess. Lady Juliet was made a Dame Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) in the 2014 Birthday Honours having previously received the LVO in 1981 and was Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire from 1998 to 2014. She died on 29 November 2014.

Lord Birkenhead died at a nursing home in Oxford on 10 June 1975, at age 67. At the time of his death, he was working on a biography of Winston Churchill (who was his godfather); the completed portion, covering Churchill&#x27;s life until 1922, was published in 1989.

<doc id="514619" wikidata="Q153899" url="?curid=514619" title="Enver Pasha">
<text>İsmail Enver (; ; 23 November 1881 – 4 August 1922), better known as Enver Pasha, was an Ottoman Turkish military officer, revolutionary, and convicted war criminal who was a part of the dictatorial triumvirate known as the &quot;Three Pashas&quot; (along with Talaat Pasha and Cemal Pasha) in the Ottoman Empire.

While stationed in Ottoman Macedonia, Enver joined the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), an organization affiliated with the Young Turks movement that was agitating against Sultan Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s despotic rule. He was a key leader of the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, which reestablished the Constitution and parliamentary democracy in the Ottoman Empire. Along with Ahmed Niyazi, Enver was hailed as &quot;hero of the revolution&quot;. However, a series of crises in the Empire, including the 31 March Incident, the Balkan Wars, and the power struggle with the Freedom and Accord Party, left Enver and the Unionists disillusioned with liberal Ottomanism. After the 1913 Ottoman coup d&#x27;état brought the CUP directly to power, Enver became War Minister, while Talaat assumed control over the civilian government.

As war minister and &quot;de facto&quot; Commander-in-Chief (despite his role as the &quot;de jure&quot; Deputy Commander-in-Chief, as the Sultan formally held the title), Enver was one of the most powerful figures in the Ottoman government. He initiated the formation of an alliance with Germany, and was instrumental in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry into World War I. He then led a disastrous attack on Russian forces in the Battle of Sarikamish, after which he blamed Armenians for his defeat. Along with Talaat, he was one of the principal perpetrators of the Late Ottoman Genocides and thus is held responsible for the death of between 800,000 and 1,800,000 Armenians, 750,000 Assyrians and 500,000 Greeks. Following defeat in World War I, Enver, along with other leading Unionists, escaped the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Military Tribunal convicted him and other Unionists and sentenced them to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for bringing the Empire into World War I and organizing massacres against Greeks and Armenians. Enver ended up in Central Asia, where he was killed leading the Basmachi Revolt against the Bolsheviks. In 1996, his remains were reburied in Turkey. Enver was subsequently rehabilitated by Turkish president Süleyman Demirel, who praised his contributions to Turkish nationalism. 

As Enver rose through the ranks of the military, he was known by increasingly esteemed titles, including Enver Efendi (), Enver Bey (), and finally Enver Pasha. &quot;Pasha&quot; was the honorary title granted to Ottoman military officers upon promotion to the rank of Mirliva (major general).

==Early life and career==

Enver was born in Constantinople (Istanbul) on 22 November 1881. Enver&#x27;s father, Ahmed ( 1860–1947), was either a bridge-keeper in Monastir (modern Bitola) or an Albanian small town public prosecutor in the Balkans. His mother Ayşe Dilara was a Tatar. According to Şuhnaz Yilmaz, he was of Gagauz descent. His uncle was Halil Pasha (later Kut). Enver had two younger brothers, Nuri and Mehmed Kamil, and two younger sisters, Hasene and Mediha. He was the brother-in-law of Lieutenant Colonel Ömer Nâzım. At age six, Enver moved with his father to Monastir, where he attended primary school. He studied at several military institutions. In 1902, he graduated from the Ottoman Military Academy as a &quot;Mektebli&quot;.

Between 1903 and 1908, Enver was stationed in Ottoman Macedonia, where he helped suppress the Macedonian Struggle. He fought no less than 54 engagements, mostly against Bulgarian bands, developing a reputation as an expert counterinsurgent. During his service, he became convinced of the need for reforms in the Ottoman military.

== Joining the CUP ==

Enver, through the assistance of his uncle, Halil Kut, became the twelfth member of the nascent Ottoman Freedom Society (OFS). The OFS later merged with the Paris-based Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) led by Ahmed Rıza. The CUP gained access to the Third Army through Enver. Upon his return to Monastir in 1906, Enver formed a CUP cell within the town and worked closely with Ottoman officer Kâzım Karabekir. Enver became the main figure in the CUP Monastir branch, and he initiated Ottoman officers like Ahmet Niyazi bey and Eyüp Sabri into the CUP organisation.

In the early twentieth century some prominent Young Turk members such as Enver developed a strong interest in the ideas of Gustave Le Bon. For example, Enver saw deputies as mediocre and in reference to Le Bon he thought that as a collective mind they had the potential to become dangerous and be the same as a despotic leader. As the CUP shifted away from the ideas of members who belonged to the old core of the organisation to those of the newer membership, this change assisted individuals like Enver in gaining a larger profile in the Young Turk movement.

In Ohri (modern Ohrid) an armed band (çete) called the Special Muslim Organisation (SMO) composed mostly of notables was created in 1907 to protect local Muslims and fight Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) bands. Enver along with Sabri recruited the SMO and turned it into the Ohri branch of the CUP with its band becoming the local CUP band. CUP Internal headquarters proposed that Enver go form a CUP band in the countryside. Approving the decision by the committee to assassinate his brother in law Lieutenant Colonel Ömer Nâzım, Enver under instructions from CUP headquarters traveled from Selanik (Thessaloniki) to Tikveş on 26 June 1908 to establish a band. CUP headquarters conferred upon Enver the title of &quot;CUP Inspector General of Internal Organisation and Executive Forces&quot;.

== Young Turk Revolution ==
On 3 July 1908, Niyazi, protesting the rule of Abdul Hamid II, fled with his band from Resne (modern Resen) into the mountains where he initiated the Young Turk Revolution and issued a proclamation that called for the restoration of the constitution of 1876. Following his example, Enver in Tikveş, and other officers such as Sabri in Ohri, also went into the mountains and formed guerilla bands. It is unclear whether the CUP had a fixed date for the revolution; in comments made in an interview following the event Enver stated that they planned for action in August 1908, yet events had forced them to begin the revolution at an earlier time. For the revolt to get local support Enver and Niyazi played on fears of possible foreign intervention. Enver led a band composed of volunteers and deserters. For example, he allowed a deserter who had engaged in brigandage in areas west of the river Vardar to join his band at Tikveș. Throughout the revolution, guerilla bands of both Enver and Niyazi consisted of Muslim (mostly Albanian) paramilitaries.

Enver sent an ultimatum to the Inspector General on 11 July 1908 and demanded that within 48 hours Abdul Hamid II issue a decree for CUP members that had been arrested and sent to Constantinople to be freed. He warned that if the ultimatum was not complied with by the Inspector General, he would refuse to accept any responsibility for future actions. In Tikveș a handwritten appeal was distributed to locals calling for them to either stay neutral or join with him. Enver possessed strong authority among fellow Muslims in the area where he resided and could communicate with them as he spoke both Albanian and Turkish. During the revolution, Enver stayed in the homes of notables, and as a sign of respect they would kiss his hands since he had earlier saved them from an attack by an IMRO band. He stated that the CUP had no support in the countryside apart from a few large landowners with CUP membership that lived in towns, yet they retained influence in their villages and were able to mobilise the population for the cause. Whole settlements were enrolled into the CUP through councils of village elders convened by Enver in Turkish villages of the Tikveş region. As the revolution spread by the third week and more officers deserted the army to join the cause, Enver and Niyazi got like minded officials and civilian notables to send multiple petitions to the Ottoman palace. Enver wrote in his memoirs that while he still was involved in band activity in the days toward the end of the revolution he composed more detailed rules of engagement for use by paramilitary units and bands. 

On 23 July he proclaimed an age of liberty in front of the government mansion of Köprülü. In Salonica, he spoke from the balconies of the &quot;Grand Hôtel D&#x27;Angleterre&quot; to a crowd in the city center, where he declared that absolutism was finished, and Ottomanism would prevail. The square would be named Eleftherias Square, or the Square of Liberty thereafter. Facing a deteriorating situation in the Balkans, on 24 July Sultan Abdul Hamid II restored the constitution of 1876.

== Aftermath ==

In the aftermath of the revolution, Niyazi and Enver remained in the political background due to their youth and junior military ranks with both agreeing that photographs of them would not be distributed to the general public; however, this decision was rarely honoured. Instead, Niyazi and Enver as leaders of the revolution elevated their positions to near legendary status, with their images placed on postcards and distributed throughout the Ottoman state. Toward the latter part of 1908, photographs of Niyazi and Enver had reached Constantinople and school children of the time played with masks on their faces that depicted the revolutionaries. In other images produced at the same time, the sultan is presented in the centre, flanked by Niyazi and Enver to either side. As the actions of both men carried the appearance of initiating the revolution, Niyazi, an Albanian, and Enver, a Turk, later received popular acclaim as &quot;heroes of freedom&quot; (&quot;hürriyet kahramanları&quot;) and symbolised Albanian-Turkish cooperation.

As a tribute to his role in the Young Turk Revolution that began the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire, Niyazi is mentioned along with Enver in the March of the Deputies ( or &quot;Meclis-i Mebusan Marşı&quot;), the anthem of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Ottoman parliament. It was performed in 1909 upon the opening of the new parliament. The fourth line of the anthem reads &quot;Long live Niyazi, long live Enver&quot; (). The Ottoman newspaper &quot;Volkan&quot;, a strong supporter of the constitution published adulatory pieces about Enver and Niyazi in 1909.

Following the revolution, Enver rose within the ranks of the Ottoman military and had an important role within army–committee relations. By 1909 he was the military attaché at Berlin and formed personal ties with high ranking German state officials and the Kaiser. It was during this time that Enver came to admire the culture of Germany and power of the German military. He invited German officers to reform the Ottoman Army. In 1909 a reactionary conspiracy to organise a countercoup culminated in the 31 March Incident; the countercoup was put down. Enver for a short time in April 1909 returned to Constantinople and joined the Action Army. As such he took an active role in the suppression of the countercoup, which resulted in the overthrow of Abdul Hamid II, who was replaced by his brother Mehmed V, while the power of the CUP was consolidated. Throughout the Young Turk era, Enver was a member of the CUP central committee from 1908 to 1918.

== Italo-Turkish War ==
In 1911, Italy launched an invasion of the Ottoman vilayet of Tripolitania (&quot;Trablus-i Garb&quot;, modern Libya), starting the Italo-Turkish War. Enver decided to join the defense of the province and left Berlin for Libya. There, he assumed the overall command after successfully mobilizing 20,000 troops. Because of the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, however, Enver and other Ottoman generals in Libya were called back to Constantinople. This allowed Italy to take control of Libya. In 1912, thanks to his active role in the war, he was made lieutenant colonel.

However, the loss of Libya cost the CUP in popularity, and it fell from government after rigging the 1912 elections (known as the &quot;Sopalı Seçimler&quot;, &quot;Election of Clubs&quot;), to be replaced by the Freedom and Accord Party (which was helped by its military arm, the Savior Officers, that denounced the CUP&#x27;s actions during the 1912 elections).

== Balkan Wars and 1913 coup ==
In October 1912, the First Balkan War broke out, and the Ottoman armies suffered severe defeats at the hands of the Balkan League. These military reversals weakened the government, and gave the committee the chance to seize power from Freedom and Accord. In a coup in January 1913, Enver and CUP leader Mehmed Talaat regained power for the committee and introduced a triumvirate that came to be called the &quot;Three Pashas&quot; which included Enver, Talaat, and Ahmed Cemal Pasha. Turkey then withdrew from the peace negotiations then under way in London and did not sign the Treaty of London (1913), resuming the First Balkan War. The change in government did not change the fact that the war was lost, and the Ottoman Empire gave up almost all of its Balkan territory to the Balkan League. Afterwards the Grand Vizier Mahmud Shevket Pasha was assassinated, allowing the CUP to take full control over the empire.

In June 1913, however, the Second Balkan War broke out between the Balkan Allies. Enver Bey took advantage of the situation and led an army into Eastern Thrace, recovering Adrianople (Edirne) from the Bulgarians, who had concentrated their forces against the Serbs and Greeks, with the Treaty of Constantinople (1913). Enver is therefore recognised by some Turks as the &quot;conqueror of Edirne&quot;.

In 1914, he became Minister of War in the cabinet of Said Halim Pasha, and married HIH Princess Emine Naciye Sultan (1898–1957), the daughter of Prince Süleyman, thus entering the royal family as a &quot;damat&quot; (&quot;bridegroom&quot; to the ruling House of Osman).

==World War I==

Being able to communicate in German, Enver Pasha, along with Talaat and Halil Bey were architects of the Ottoman-German Alliance, and expected a quick victory in the war that would benefit the Ottoman Empire. Without informing the cabinet, he allowed the two German warships SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau, under the command of German admiral Wilhelm Souchon, to enter the Dardanelles to escape British pursuit; the subsequent &quot;donation&quot; of the ships to the neutral Ottomans worked powerfully in Germany&#x27;s favor, despite French and Russian diplomacy to keep the Ottoman Empire out of the war. Finally on 29 October, the point of no return was reached when Admiral Souchon, now Commander-in-Chief of the Ottoman navy, took &quot;Goeben&quot;, &quot;Breslau&quot;, and a squadron of Ottoman warships into the Black Sea and bombed the Russian ports of Odessa, Sevastopol, and Theodosia. Russia declared war on Ottoman Empire on 2 November, and Britain followed suit on 5 November. Most of the Turkish cabinet members and CUP leaders were against such a rushed entry to the war, but Enver Pasha held that it was the right course of action.

As soon as the war started, 31 October 1914, Enver ordered that all men of military age report to army recruiting offices. The offices were unable to handle the vast flood of men, and long delays occurred. This had the effect of ruining the crop harvest for that year.

===Battle of Sarikamish, 1914===

Enver Pasha assumed command of the Ottoman forces arrayed against the Russians in the Caucasus theatre. He wanted to encircle the Russians, force them out of Ottoman territory, and take back Kars and Batumi, which had been ceded after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. Enver thought of himself as a great military leader, while the German military adviser, Liman von Sanders, thought of him as incompetent. Enver ordered a complex attack on the Russians, placed himself in personal control of the Third Army, and was utterly defeated at the Battle of Sarikamish in December 1914 – January 1915. His strategy seemed feasible on paper, but he had ignored external conditions, such as the terrain and the weather. Enver&#x27;s army (118,000 men) was defeated by the Russian force (80,000 men), and in the subsequent retreat, tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers died. This was the single worst Ottoman defeat of World War I. On his return to Constantinople, Enver Pasha blamed his failure on his Armenian soldiers, although in January 1915, an Armenian named Hovannes had saved his life during a battle by carrying Enver through battle lines on his back. Nonetheless, Enver Pasha later initiated the deportations and sporadic massacres of Western Armenians, culminating in the Armenian genocide.

===Commanding the forces of the capital, 1915–1918===

After his defeat at Sarıkamısh, Enver returned to Istanbul (Constantinople) and took command of the Turkish forces around the capital. He was confident that the capital was safe from any Allied attacks. The British and French were planning on forcing the approaches to Constantinople in the hope of knocking the Ottomans out of the war. A large Allied fleet assembled and staged an attack on the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915. The attack (the forerunner to the failed Gallipoli campaign) was a disaster, resulting in the loss of several ships. As a result, Enver turned over command to Liman von Sanders, who led the successful defence of Gallipoli. Enver then left to attend to pressing concerns on the Caucasus Front. Later, after many towns on the peninsula had been destroyed and women and children killed by the Allied bombardment, Enver proposed setting up a concentration camp for the remaining French and British citizens in the empire. Henry Morgenthau, the American ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, convinced Enver not to go through with this plan.

===Yildirim===
Enver&#x27;s plan for Falkenhayn&#x27;s Yildirim Army Group was to retake Baghdad, recently taken by Maude. This was nearly impossible for logistical reasons. Turkish troops were deserting freely, and when Enver visited Beirut in June 1917, soldiers were forbidden to be stationed along his route for fear that he would be assassinated. Lack of rolling stock meant that troops were often detrained at Damascus and marched south.

===Army of Islam===


During 1917, due to the Russian Revolution and subsequent Civil War, the Russian army in the Caucasus fell apart and dissolved. At the same time, the CUP managed to win the friendship of the Bolsheviks with the signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918). Enver looked for victory when Russia withdrew from the Caucasus region. When Enver discussed his plans for taking over southern Russia, he ordered the creation of a new military force called the Army of Islam which would have no German officers. Enver&#x27;s Army of Islam avoided Georgia and marched through Azerbaijan. The Third Army under Vehib Pasha was also moving forward to pre-war borders and towards the First Republic of Armenia, which formed the frontline in the Caucasus. General Tovmas Nazarbekian was the commander on the Caucasus front, and Andranik Ozanian took the command of Armenia within the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman advance was halted at the Battle of Sardarabad.

The Army of Islam, under the control of Nuri Pasha, moved forward and attacked Australian, New Zealand, British, and Canadian troops led by General Lionel Charles Dunsterville at Baku. General Dunsterville ordered the evacuation of the city on 14 September, after six weeks of occupation, and withdrew to Iran. As the Army of Islam and their Azerbaijani allies entered the city on September 15 following the Battle of Baku, up to 30,000 Armenian civilians were massacred. 

However, after the Armistice of Mudros between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire on 30 October, Ottoman troops were obliged to withdraw and replaced by the Triple Entente. These conquests in the Caucasus counted for very little in the war as a whole but they did however ensure that Baku remained within the boundaries of Azerbaijan while a part of the Soviet Union and later as an independent nation.

==Armistice and exile==

Faced with defeat, the Sultan dismissed Enver from his post as War Minister on 4 October 1918, while the rest of Talaat Pasha&#x27;s government resigned on 14 October 1918. On 30 October 1918, the Ottoman Empire capitulated by signing the Armistice of Mudros. Two days later, the &quot;Three Pashas&quot; all fled into exile. On 1 January 1919, the new government expelled Enver Pasha from the army. He was tried &quot;in absentia&quot; in the Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20 for crimes of &quot;plunging the country into war without a legitimate reason, forced deportation of Armenians and leaving the country without permission&quot; and condemned to death.

Enver first attempted to link up with Halil and Nuri to reopen the Caucasus campaign, but his boat ran aground and hearing the army was demobilizing he gave up and went to Berlin like the other Unionists émigrés did. He settled in Babelsberg, and in April 1919 after meeting with Karl Radek with Talaat, he took on the role of a secret envoy for his friend General Hans von Seeckt who wished for a German-Soviet alliance. In August 1920, Enver sent Seeckt a letter in which he offered on behalf of the Soviet Union the partition of Poland in return for German arms deliveries to Soviet Russia. Besides working for General von Seeckt, Enver envisioned cooperation between the new Soviet Russian government against the British, and went to Moscow.

Accompanying Mehmed Ali Sâmi, Enver&#x27;s new pseudonym, was his Unionist comrade Bahaeddin Şakir. Sâmi would be a doctor representing the Turkish Red Crescent in Russia. On 10 October 1919, their plane flight took off from the German border and stopped in Königsberg and then Šiauliai but crashed in the outskirts of Kaunas, Lithuania. Stranded in a country teeming with Allied soldiers, they weren&#x27;t recognized by journalists or occupation forces until they were about to escape. They were eventually arrested for two months, but Enver and Şakir managed to escape from the Lithuanian prison back to Berlin. Enver and Şakir tried again to enter Russia by air but their plane broke down and crashed not even beyond the German border. After tending to their wounds in a near by village, they returned to Berlin. Enver&#x27;s insistence to arrive to Moscow by plane costed them another plane crash in flight trials. Eventually Cemal joined the duo, and using a plane that successfully passed flight tests they set off once again for Moscow. But hearing strange noises from the engine, Enver asked the pilot to turn back. After small repairs to the plane Enver attempted a fifth flight to Moscow, where the plane disintegrated one hour into the flight. While Enver was determined to make a grand entrance from the sky, Şakir and Cemal gave up and instead joined a Russian prisoner of war convoy heading back to their homeland. Enver&#x27;s new alias was now Herr Altman, &quot;a German Jewish Communist of no importance&quot;. In his sixth attempt, a one-seat plane carrying Enver and a pilot malfunctioned in mid-air and landed in British-occupied Danzig. Enver begged the pilot to repair the plane lest he would be captured by the British. Taking off once again, they only made it as far as Königsburg. The plane once again repaired, they made it to Bolshevik occupied Estonia to refill on gas, but the Bolsheviks arrested Enver, mistaking him for a fugitive Baltic German count that fled to Germany, and imprison him in the city of Reval. Enver&#x27;s case for his identity was not helped when an Estonian peasant identified him as the abusive count. Enver took up painting in prison, at one point painting a portrait of the warden and his family. With the Estonian-German peace treaty, Enver was repatriated to Germany as the German count.

Enver finally made it to Moscow in August 1920 (he came by land in the end). There he was well-received, and established contacts with representatives from Central Asia and other exiled CUP members as the director of the Soviet Government&#x27;s Asiatic Department. He also met with Bolshevik leaders, including Georgy Chicherin, Radek, Grigory Zinoviev and Vladimir Lenin. He tried to support the Turkish national movement and corresponded with Mustafa Kemal, giving him the guarantee that he did not intend to intervene in the movement in Anatolia. Between 1 and 8 September 1920, he was in Baku for the Congress of the Peoples of the East, representing Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. His appearance was a personal triumph, but the congress failed in its aim to create a mass pro-Bolshevik movement among Muslims. Victor Serge, a witness, recorded that:

==Relations with Mustafa Kemal==

Much has been written about the poor relations between Enver and Mustafa Kemal, two men who played pivotal roles in the Turkish history of the 20th century. Both hailed from the Balkans, and the two served together in North Africa during the wars preceding World War I, Enver being Mustafa Kemal&#x27;s senior. Enver disliked Mustafa Kemal for his circumspect attitude toward the political agenda pursued by his Committee of Union and Progress, and regarded him as a serious rival. Mustafa Kemal (later known as Atatürk) considered Enver to be a dangerous figure who might lead the country to ruin; he criticized Enver and his colleagues for their policies and their involvement of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. In the years of upheaval that followed the Armistice of October 1918, when Mustafa Kemal led the Turkish resistance to occupying and invading forces, Enver sought to return from exile, but his attempts to do so and join the military effort were blocked by the Ankara government under Mustafa Kemal.

== Last years ==

On 30 July 1921, with the Turkish War of Independence in full swing, Enver decided to return to Anatolia. He went to Batum to be close to the new border. However, Mustafa Kemal did not want him among the Turkish revolutionaries. Mustafa Kemal had stopped all friendly ties with Enver Pasha and the CUP as early as 1912, and he explicitly rejected the pan-Turkic ideas and what Mustafa Kemal perceived as Enver Pasha&#x27;s utopian goals. Enver Pasha changed his plans and traveled to Moscow where he managed to win the trust of the Soviet authorities. In November 1921 he was sent by Lenin to Bukhara in the Bukharan People&#x27;s Soviet Republic to help suppress the Basmachi Revolt against the local pro-Moscow Bolshevik regime. Instead, however, he made secret contacts with some of the rebellion&#x27;s leaders and, along with a small number of followers, defected to the &quot;Basmachi&quot; side. His aim was to unite the numerous Basmachi groups under his own command and mount a co-ordinated offensive against the Bolsheviks in order to realise his pan-Turkic dreams. After a number of successful military operations he managed to establish himself as the rebels&#x27; supreme commander, and turned their disorganized forces into a small but well-drilled army. His command structure was built along German lines and his staff included a number of experienced Turkish officers.

According to David Fromkin:
On 4 August 1922, as he allowed his troops to celebrate the Kurban Bayramı (Eid al-Adha) holiday while retaining a guard of 30 men at his headquarters near the village of Ab-i-Derya near Dushanbe, the Red Army Bashkir cavalry brigade under the command of ethnic Armenian, Yakov Melkumov (Hakob Melkumian), launched a surprise attack. According to some sources, Enver and some 25 of his men mounted their horses and charged the approaching troops, when Enver was killed by machine-gun fire. In his memoirs, Enver Pasha&#x27;s aide Yaver Suphi Bey stated that Enver Pasha died of a bullet wound right above his heart during a cavalry charge. Alternatively, according to Melkumov&#x27;s memoirs, Enver managed to escape on horseback and hid for four days in the village of Chaghan. His hideout was located after a Red Army officer infiltrated the village in disguise. Melkumov&#x27;s troops ambushed Enver at Chaghan, and in the ensuing combat he was killed by machine gun fire. Some sources write that Melkumov personally killed Enver Pasha with his sabre, although Melkumov does not claim this in his memoirs.
Fromkin writes:
Enver&#x27;s body was buried near Ab-i-Derya in Tajikistan. In 1996, his remains were brought to Turkey and reburied at Abide-i Hürriyet (Monument of Liberty) cemetery in Şişli, Istanbul. He was re-buried on the 4 August, the anniversary of his death in 1922. Enver Pasha&#x27;s image remains controversial in Turkey, since Enver and Atatürk had a personal rivalry at the end of the Ottoman Empire and his memory was cultivated by the Kemalists. But upon his body&#x27;s arrival in Turkey, he was rehabilitated by the Turkish President Süleyman Demirel who held a speech acknowledging his contributions to Turkish nationalism. Following renewed hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno Karabakh region in 2020, Enver Pasha&#x27;s role during World War I was praised by Turkish President Erdoğan during an Azeri victory parade in Baku. In 2023, Azerbaijani officials issued a map of the formerly Armenian Stepanakert, renaming one of the streets after Enver Pasha.

==Family==
After Enver&#x27;s death, three of his four siblings, Nuri (1889–1949), Mehmed Kamil (1900–62), and Hasene Hanım, adopted the surname &quot;Killigil&quot; after the 1934 Surname Law required all Turkish citizens to adopt a surname.

Enver&#x27;s sister Hasene Hanım married Nazım Bey. Nazım Bey, an aid-de-camp of Abdul Hamid II, survived an assassination attempt by Talaat during the 1908 Young Turk Revolution of which his brother-in-law Enver was a leader. With Nazım, Hasene gave birth to (1910–2000), who would become a famous Turkish film director and producer.

Enver&#x27;s other sister, Mediha Hanım (later Mediha Orbay; 1895–1983), married Kâzım Orbay, a prominent Turkish general and politician. On 16 October 1945, their son Haşmet Orbay, Enver&#x27;s nephew, shot and killed a physician named Neşet Naci Arzan, an event known as the &quot;&quot;. At the urging of the Governor of Ankara, Nevzat Tandoğan, Haşmet Orbay&#x27;s friend Reşit Mercan initially took the blame. After a second trial revealed Haşmet Orbay as the perpetrator, however, he was convicted. The murder became a political scandal in Turkey after the suicide of Tandoğan, the suspicious death of the case&#x27;s public prosecutor , and the resignation of Kâzım Orbay from his position as Chief of the General Staff of Turkey after his son&#x27;s conviction.

Djevdet Bey who was the Vali of Van in 1915, was also a brother-in-law of his.&quot;&quot;

== Marriage==
Around 1908, Enver Pasha became the subject of gossip about an alleged romance between him and Princess Iffet of Egypt. When this story reached Istanbul, the grand vizier, Hüseyin Hilmi Pasha decided to exploit Enver&#x27;s marital eligibility by arranging a rapprochement between the Committee for Union and Progress and the imperial family. After a careful search, the grand vizier chose the twelve-year-old Naciye Sultan, a granddaughter of Sultan Abdulmejid I, as Enver&#x27;s future bride. Both the grand vizier and Enver&#x27;s mother then notified him of this decision. Enver had never seen Naciye, and he did not trust his mother&#x27;s letters, since he suspected her of being enamored with the idea of having a princess as her daughter-in-law.

Therefore, he asked a reliable friend, Ahmed Rıza Bey, who was a member of the Turkish Parliament to investigate. When the latter reported favorably on the prospective bride&#x27;s education and beauty, as well as on the prospective dowry, Enver took a practical view of this marriage and accepted the arrangement. Naciye had been previously engaged to Şehzade Abdurrahim Hayri. However, Sultan Mehmed V broke off the engagement, and in April 1909, when Naciye was just twelve years old, engaged her to Enver, fifteen years older than her. Following the old Ottoman pattern of life and tradition, the engagement ceremony was celebrated in Enver&#x27;s absence as he remained in Berlin.

The marriage took place on 15 May 1911 in the Dolmabahçe Palace, and was performed by Şeyhülislam Musa Kazım Efendi. Head clerk of the sultan Halid Ziya Bey served as Naciye&#x27;s deputy, and her witnesses were director of the imperial kitchen Galib Bey, and the personal physician of the sultan Hacı Ahmed Bey. Minister of war Mahmud Şevket Pasha served as Enver&#x27;s deputy, and his witnesses were aide-de-camp of the sultan Binbaşı Re&#x27;fet Bey and chamberlain of the imperial gates Ahsan Bey. The wedding took place about three years later on 5 March 1914 in the Nişantaşı Palace. The couple were given one of the palaces of Kuruçeşme. The marriage was very happy.

On 17 May 1917, Naciye gave birth to the couple&#x27;s eldest child, a daughter, Mahpeyker Hanımsultan. She was followed by a second daughter, Türkan Hanımsultan, born on 4 July 1919. Both of them were born in Istanbul. During Enver&#x27;s stay in Berlin, Naciye and her daughters Mahpeyker and Türkan joined him. When Enver left for Russian SSR his family remained there. His son, Sultanzade Ali Bey was born in Berlin on 29 September 1921, after Enver&#x27;s departure and he never saw him. Naciye was widowed at Enver&#x27;s death on 4 August 1922.

After his death, Naciye remarried his brother Mehmed Kamil Killigil (1900–1962) in 1923, and had one other daughter, Rana Hanımsultan.

==Issue ==
By his wife, Enver had two daughters and a son:
* Mahpeyker Hanımsultan (17 May 1917 – 3 April 2000). Married once, had a son.
* Türkan Hanımsultan (4 July 1919 – 25 December 1989). Married once, had a son.
* Sultanzade Ali Bey (29 September 1921 – 2 December 1971). Married twice, had a daughter.

==In arts and culture==
Enver Pasha plays an important role in &quot;The Golden House of Samarkand&quot;, a comic book by Hugo Pratt, from the Italian series &quot;Corto Maltese&quot;.

==Works==
* Enver authored a book in German, &quot;Enver Pascha «um Tripolis»,&quot; which is his diaries during the war in Libya (1911–12).

<text>The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was a Royal Navy formation that saw action against Japan during the Second World War. It was formed from aircraft carriers, other surface warships, submarines and supply vessels of the RN and British Commonwealth navies in November 1944.

After formation in Ceylon, the BPF began with operations against Japanese resources in Sumatra before moving to Australia where it made its headquarters at Sydney with a forward base at Manus Island off Papua New Guinea. The fleet supported the invasion of Okinawa in March 1945 by neutralising the Sakishima Islands. Though subjected to heavy attacks by Japanese aircraft, their well-armoured carriers and modern fighter aircraft gave effective protection. Submarines attached to the fleet sank Japanese shipping, and in July 1945 the fleet joined in the bombardment of the Japanese home islands. By the time Japan surrendered in August 1945, the fleet included four battleships, six fleet carriers, fifteen smaller carriers and over 750 aircraft.

==Background==
Following their retreat to the western side of the Indian Ocean in 1942, British naval forces did not return to the South West Pacific theatre until 17 May 1944, when an Allied carrier task force implemented Operation Transom, a joint raid on Surabaya, Java.

The US was liberating British territories in the Pacific and extending its influence. It was therefore seen as a political and military imperative by the British Government to restore a British presence in the region and to deploy British forces against Japan. The British Government was determined that British territories, such as Hong Kong, should be recaptured by British forces.

The British Government was not initially unanimous on the commitment of the BPF. Churchill, in particular, argued against it, not wishing to be a visibly junior partner in what had been exclusively the United States&#x27; battle. He also considered that a British presence would be unwelcome and should be concentrated on Burma and Malaya. Naval planners, supported by the Chiefs of Staff, believed that such a commitment would strengthen British influence and the British Chiefs of Staff considered mass resignation, so strongly held were their opinions.

The Admiralty had proposed a British role in the Pacific in early 1944 but the initial USN response had been discouraging. Admiral Ernest King, Commander-in-Chief United States Fleet and Chief of Naval Operations, was reluctant to concede any such role and raised a number of objections, and insisted that the BPF should be self-sufficient. These were eventually overcome or discounted and at a meeting, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt &quot;intervened to say that the British Fleet was no sooner offered than accepted. In this, though the fact was not mentioned, he overruled Admiral King&#x27;s opinion.&quot;

The Australian Government had sought US military assistance in 1942, when it was faced with the possibility of Japanese invasion. While Australia had made a significant contribution to the Pacific War, it had never been an equal partner with its US counterparts in strategy. It was argued that a British presence would act as a counterbalance to the powerful and increasing US presence in the Pacific.

===Allied co-operation===
British and American political objectives were in conflict: Britain needed to &quot;show the flag&quot; in an effective way while the US wished to demonstrate, beyond question, its own pre-eminence in the Pacific. In practice, there were cordial relations between the fighting fleets and their sea commanders. Although Admiral King had stipulated that the BPF should be wholly self-sufficient, in practice, material assistance was freely given.

==Fleet==
===Constituent forces===
The fleet was founded when Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser struck his flag at Trincomalee as Commander-in-Chief of the British Eastern Fleet and hoisted it in the gunboat , a worn out ship in use as offices, as Commander-in-Chief British Pacific Fleet. He later transferred his flag to a more suitable vessel, the battleship .

The Eastern Fleet was based in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and reorganised into the British East Indies Fleet, subsequently becoming the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). The BPF operated against targets in Sumatra, (operations Robson and Meridian) gaining experience until early 1945, when it departed Trincomalee for Sydney.

The Royal Navy provided the majority of the fleet&#x27;s vessels and all the capital ships but elements and personnel included contributions from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA), as well as the Commonwealth nations, including the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). With its larger vessels integrated with United States Navy (USN) formations since 1942, the RAN&#x27;s contribution was limited. A high proportion of naval aviators were New Zealanders and Canadians. The USN also contributed to the BPF, as did personnel from the South African Navy (SAN). Port facilities in Australia and New Zealand also made vital contributions in support of the British Pacific Fleet.

During World War II, the fleet was commanded by Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser. In practice, command of the fleet in action devolved to Vice-Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings, with Vice-Admiral Sir Philip Vian in charge of air operations by the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm (FAA). The fighting end of the fleet was referred to as Task Force 37 from 28 May 1945 (previously 57) and the Fleet Train was Task Force 113. The 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron was the lead carrier formation.

No. 300 Wing RAF was established in Australia in late 1944 to fly transport aircraft in support of the BPF, and came under the direct command of Fraser. The wing was expanded to a group in 1945 and conducted regular flights from Sydney to the fleet&#x27;s forward bases.

The aviation squadrons were formed into air groups from June 1945 for administering each carrier&#x27;s embarked squadrons.

===Supply===
The requirement that the BPF be self-sufficient meant the establishment of a fleet train that could support a naval force at sea for weeks or months. The Royal Navy had been accustomed to operating close to its bases in Britain, the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Infrastructure and expertise were lacking in the Pacific rim. In the north Atlantic and Mediterranean, the high risk of submarine and air attack precluded routine refuelling at sea. Fortunately for the BPF &quot;the American logistics authorities... interpreted self-sufficiency in a very liberal sense.&quot; American officers told Rear Admiral Douglas Fisher, commander of the British Fleet Train, that he could have anything and everything &quot;that could be given without Admiral King&#x27;s knowledge.&quot;

The Admiralty sent Vice Admiral Charles Daniel to the United States for consultation about the supply and administration of the fleet. He then proceeded to Australia where he became Vice Admiral, Administration, British Pacific Fleet, a role that &quot;if unspectacular compared with command of a fighting squadron, was certainly one of the most arduous to be allocated to a British Flag officer during the entire war.&quot; The US Pacific Fleet had assembled an enormous fleet of oilers and supply ships of every type. Even before the war, it had been active in the development of underway replenishment techniques.

In February 1944 the Admiralty estimated that the Fleet Train would require 134 merchant ships, of about 1½ million gross tons. As only 20 ships could be provided &quot;in due course&quot; the remainder would have to come from: the United States, the Admiralty&#x27;s resources (although only a &quot;handful&quot; of its 560 merchant ships were actually available), or the general pool of merchant shipping (on which there were &quot;many demands&quot;). And the Admiralty requirements increased from 80 ships (totalling 590,000 tons) in January to 134 then by the end of March to 158. The Prime Minister had been alarmed for the original requirements for 80 ships, and on 9 April he issued a minute defining the limits of the Fleet Train based on a minimum of 24 million tons of imports &quot;this year&quot;. He referred to the Navy getting 230,000 tons of new merchant shipping in about a year. The minute referred to operations &quot;in the Indian ocean or in the South-West Pacific&quot;, reflecting his own preference for Operation Culverin against northern Sumatra and Malaya rather than the &quot;Middle Strategy&quot;.

The Admiralty realised that it needed a great deal of new equipment and training, in a short time and with whatever it had to hand. Lacking specialist ships, it had to improvise a fleet train from RN, RFA and merchant ships. On 8 February 1944, the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Cunningham, informed the Defence Committee that 91 ships would be required to support the BPF. This was based on an assumption that the BPF would be active off the Philippines or would have a base there. By March, the war zone had moved north and the Americans were unwilling to allow the British to establish facilities in the Philippines. The estimate had grown to 158 ships, as it was recognised that operations eventually would be fought close to Japan. This had to be balanced against the shipping needed to import food for the population of the UK. In January 1945, the War cabinet was forced to postpone the deployment of the fleet by two months due to the shortage of shipping.

The BPF found that its tankers were too few, too slow and in some cases unsuitable for the task of replenishment at sea. Its oiling gear, hoses and fittings were too often poorly designed. British ships refuelled at sea mostly by the over-the-stern method, a safer but less efficient technique compared with the American method of refuelling in parallel. Lack of proper equipment and insufficient practice meant burst hoses or excessive time at risk to submarine attack, while holding a constant course during fuelling. As the Royal Australian Navy had discovered, British-built ships had only about a third of the refrigeration space of a comparable American ship. They also suffered from limited fuel tankage and less efficient machinery, particularly the capital ships (A comparison of HMS &quot;King George V&quot; and USS &quot;Washington&quot; conducted in 1942 found the British ship burned 39 per cent more fuel at cruising speed and 20 per cent at high speed, giving her half the action radius.) British ships therefore required replenishment more frequently than American ships. In some cases even American-built equipment was not interchangeable, for FAA aircraft had been &quot;Anglicized&quot; by the installation of British radios and oxygen masks, while Vought Corsairs had their wing-folding arrangements modified to fit into the more cramped hangars of British carriers. Replacement aircraft therefore had to be brought from the UK.

The British Chiefs of Staff decided early on to base the BPF in Australia rather than India. While it was apparent that Australia, with its population of only about seven million could not support the projected 675,000 men and women of the BPF, the actual extent of the Australian contribution was undetermined. The Australian government agreed to contribute to the support of the BPF but the Australian economy was fully committed to the war effort and manpower and stores for the BPF could only come from taking them from American and Australian forces fighting the Japanese.

Unfortunately, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser arrived in Sydney on 10 December 1944 under the mistaken impression that Australia had asked for the BPF and promised to provide for its needs. Two days later, the Acting Prime Minister of Australia Frank Forde announced the allocation of £21,156,500 for the maintenance of the BPF. In January 1945, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur agreed to release American stockpiles in Australia to support the BPF. The Australian government soon became concerned at the voracious demands of the BPF works programme, which was criticised by Australian military leaders. In April 1945, Fraser publicly criticised the Australian government&#x27;s handling of waterside industrial disputes that were holding up British ships. The government was shocked and angered but agreed to allocate £6,562,500 for BPF naval works. Fraser was not satisfied. On 8 August 1945, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Clement Attlee felt obliged to express his regret for the misunderstandings to the Australian government.

After bombarding the Sumatra oil refineries for Nimitz, the Fleet arrived in Australia on 4 February 1945; it comprised two battleships, four fleet carriers, three cruisers and accompanying destroyers. The Fleet Train comprised over 300,000 tons of shipping as built or converted since the beginning of 1944. In June 1945 the Fleet was to comprise four battleships, ten aircraft carriers, sixteen cruisers (including two from New Zealand and one from Canada), forty destroyers and about ninety escorts (including Canadian escorts).

The distance from Sydney was too far to allow efficient fleet support so with much American support, a forward base was established at Seeadler Harbor, Manus atoll, in the Admiralty Islands, which was described as &quot;Scapa Flow with bloody palm trees&quot;. As well as its base at Sydney, the Fleet Air Arm established Mobile Naval Air Bases (MONABs) in Australia to provide supplies and technical support for the aircraft. The first of these became active in Sydney in January 1945.

==Operations==
Major actions in which the fleet was involved included Operation Meridian, air strikes in January 1945 against oil production at Palembang, Sumatra. These raids, conducted in bad weather, succeeded in reducing the oil supply of the Japanese Navy. A total of 48 FAA aircraft were lost due to enemy action and crash landings against claims of 30 Japanese aeroplanes destroyed in dogfights and 38 on the ground.

The United States Navy (USN), which had control of Allied operations in the Pacific Ocean Areas, gave the BPF combat units the name Task Force 57 (TF-57) when it joined Admiral Raymond Spruance&#x27;s United States Fifth Fleet on 15 March 1945. On 27 May 1945, it became Task Force 37 (TF-37) when it became part of Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s United States Third Fleet.

In March 1945, while supporting the invasion of Okinawa, the BPF had sole responsibility for operations in the Sakishima Islands. Its role was to suppress Japanese air activity, using gunfire and air attack, at potential &quot;kamikaze&quot; staging airfields that would otherwise be a threat to US Navy vessels operating at Okinawa. The British fleet carriers with their armoured flight decks were subject to heavy and repeated &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks, but they proved highly resistant, and returned to action relatively quickly. The USN liaison officer on commented: &quot;When a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits a US carrier it means 6 months of repair at Pearl [Harbor]. When a &quot;kamikaze&quot; hits a Limey carrier it&#x27;s just a case of &#x27;Sweepers, man your brooms&#x27;.&quot;

Fleet Air Arm Supermarine Seafires saw service in the Pacific campaigns. Due to their good high altitude performance, short range and lack of ordnance-carrying capabilities (compared to the Hellcats and Corsairs of the Fleet) the Seafires were allocated the defensive duties of combat air patrol (CAP) over the fleet. Seafires were vital in countering the &quot;kamikaze&quot; attacks during the Iwo Jima landings and beyond. The Seafires&#x27; best day was 15 August 1945, shooting down eight attacking aircraft for one loss.
In April 1945, the British 4th Submarine Flotilla was transferred to the big Allied submarine base at Fremantle, Western Australia, as part of the BPF. Its most notable success in this period was the sinking of the heavy cruiser , on 8 June 1945 in Banka Strait, off Sumatra, by the submarines and . On 31 July 1945, in Operation Struggle, the British midget submarine &quot;XE3&quot;, crewed by Lieutenant Ian Fraser, Acting Leading Seaman James Magennis, Sub-Lieutenant William James Lanyon Smith, RNZNVR and Engine Room Artificer Third Class, Charles Alfred Reed, attacked Japanese shipping at Singapore. They seriously damaged the heavy cruiser , while docked at her berth at Selatar Naval Base. Fraser and Magennis were awarded the Victoria Cross, Smith received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Reed the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal (CGM).

Battleships and aircraft from the fleet also participated in the Allied naval bombardments on Japanese home islands. For the assaults on Japan, the British commanders accepted the BPF should become a component element of the US 3rd Fleet, commanded by Admiral William Halsey. Battleship bombarded Hitachi, about 80 mi (130 km) northeast of Tokyo, and Hamamatsu, near Toyohashi. This was the last time a British battleship fired in action; the US fleet commander, William Halsey, excluded British forces from the bombing of Kure naval base. Halsey wrote in his memoirs: &quot;it was imperative that we forestall a possible postwar claim by Britain that she had delivered even a part of the final blow that demolished the Japanese fleet... an exclusively American attack was therefore in American interests&quot;. Carrier strikes by British naval aircraft were carried out against land and harbour targets during the attacks on Kure and the Inland Sea, 24–28 July 1945. Naval aircraft attacked the port of Osaka, airfields, and, notably, sank Japanese escort carrier &quot;Shimane Maru&quot; and disabled the &quot;Kaiyō&quot;. Two escort ships and several smaller vessels were also sunk.

The BPF would have played a major part in a proposed invasion of the Japanese home islands, known as Operation Downfall, which was cancelled after Japan surrendered. The last naval air action in World War II was on VJ-Day when British carrier aircraft shot down Japanese Zero fighters.

By August 1948, the Fleet had shrunk to comprise cruisers &quot;London&quot;, ; destroyers , ; &quot;Concord&quot;, &quot;Consort&quot;, ; frigates , Ametheyst, and ; submarines , , ; despatch vessel ; fleet tug ; RFA salvage vessels RFA King Salvor (A291), RFA Prince Salvor (A292); survey ship ; controlled minesweeper &quot;Dabchick&quot; and seven minesweepers, including &quot;Michael&quot; and &quot;Flying Fish&quot;.

<doc id="514631" wikidata="Q3586421" url="?curid=514631" title="1976 Quebec general election">
<text>The 1976 Quebec general election was held on November 15, 1976 to elect members to National Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. It was one of the most significant elections in Quebec history, rivalled only by the 1960 general election, and caused major repercussions in the rest of Canada. The Parti Québécois, led by René Lévesque, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Premier Robert Bourassa.

The Parti Québécois&#x27;s campaign focused on providing good government, in contrast to the many scandals that had plagued the Liberals since 1973. The PQ&#x27;s stated goal of achieving independence for Quebec from Canada was portrayed as only secondary, but the election of a sovereigntist government in Quebec caused great upset in the rest of Canada and led to extensive discussions about reforming the Canadian Confederation and finding ways of accommodating Quebec.

The Parti Québécois used its term in office to introduce numerous bills to implement its agenda. The first bill introduced in the new session of the National Assembly was legislation to confirm French as the sole official language of Quebec, and to implement measures to make this a social reality. The legislative number of this bill, &quot;Bill One,&quot; was intended to signify the importance of the bill for the new government. The bill was withdrawn and significantly altered, however, and was eventually re-introduced as &quot;Bill 101&quot; (or &quot;la Loi 101&quot; in French), also known as the Charter of the French Language. With some modifications, the Charter of the French Language remains in effect today and has shaped modern Quebec society in far-reaching ways.

The 1976 election also set the stage for the 1980 Quebec referendum on the PQ&#x27;s proposal for political independence in an economic union with the rest of Canada called sovereignty-association. The proposal was soundly defeated in the referendum.

Bourassa had called the election after only three years, well before the maximum possible term of five years. It is possible that he may have counted on a boost from his successful rescue of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal after cost overruns and construction delays by the Montreal municipal government of Mayor Jean Drapeau. If so, he badly miscalculated. He not only lost the election, but was resoundingly defeated in his own riding by a PQ challenger. Bourassa resigned as Liberal leader, and his political career appeared to be over. He left Quebec and took up teaching positions in the United States and Europe. However, he later made a remarkable comeback in the 1985 general election.

The once-powerful Union Nationale made a modest comeback after being evicted from the legislature three years earlier. It won 11 seats under Rodrigue Biron and, for the first time, won significant support from some anglophone voters. An anglophone UN member, William Shaw was elected to the National Assembly. However, this proved to be the party&#x27;s last hurrah. Successive floor-crossings, retirements, and resignations reduced the UN to only five members during the term. The party lost all of those remaining seats five years later, never to return; it would continue to exist nominally until 1989.

==Campaign==
The Liberals and &quot;péquistes&quot; both fielded full slates. The Unionists and the &quot;créditistes&quot; decided not to nominate candidates in Beauce-Sud, in order to clear the way for the &quot;pénépiste&quot; Fabien Roy to hold the riding. The Unionists did not have a candidate in Outremont. Otherwise, all other constituencies experienced at least four-way contests.

The election also saw the emergence of two other political groups. The Democratic Alliance, led by Nick Auf der Maur, ran 13 candidates in the anglophone areas of the Island of Montreal, while the &quot;Parti national populaire&quot; (founded by Fabien Roy and Jérôme Choquette) had 36 candidates provincewide but ran a less-organized campaign. The PNP had attempted to merge with the UN earlier in August, but the effort was called off in September because of a falling-out between Choquette and the UN leader Rodrigue Biron.

<doc id="514637" wikidata="Q543028" url="?curid=514637" title="Battle of the Washita River">
<text>The Battle of the Washita River (also called Battle of the Washita or the Washita Massacre) occurred on November 27, 1868, when Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s 7th U.S. Cavalry attacked Black Kettle&#x27;s Southern Cheyenne camp on the Washita River (the present-day Washita Battlefield National Historic Site near Cheyenne, Oklahoma).

The Cheyenne camp was the most isolated band of a major winter encampment along the river of numerous Native American tribal bands, totaling thousands of people. Custer&#x27;s forces attacked the village because scouts had found it by tracking the trail of an Indian party that had raided white settlers. Black Kettle and his people had been at peace and were seeking peace. Custer&#x27;s soldiers killed women and children in addition to warriors, although they also took many captive to serve as hostages and human shields. The number of Cheyenne killed in the attack has been disputed since the first reports.

==Background==
After the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty, they wereaccording to the final treaty text as affirmed by Congressrequired to move south from present-day Kansas and Colorado to a new reservation in Indian Territory (modern Oklahoma). The actual oral accord of the treaty negotiations, however, had guaranteed the Cheyennes their traditional hunting lands as long as there was sufficient buffalo to justify the chase, a crucial treaty stipulation which was tacitly dropped in the subsequent ratification process. This forced them to give up their traditional territory for one with little arable land and away from buffalo, their main source of meat and a center of their culture. Months of fragile peace survived raids between warring Kaw Indians and Southern Cheyennes.

But in summer 1868, war parties of Southern Cheyenne and allied Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, Northern Cheyenne, Brulé, Oglala, and Pawnee warriors attacked white settlements in western Kansas, southeast Colorado, and northwest Texas. Among these raids were those along the Solomon and Saline rivers in Kansas, which began August 10, 1868. The warriors killed at least 15 white settlers, wounded others, and were reported to have raped some women, as well as taking others captive to be adopted into their tribes.

In 1897, Kansas Rep. Horace L. Moore remarked at a meeting of the Kansas State Historical Society that &quot;The total of losses from September 12, 1868, to February 9, 1869, exclusive of casualties incident to military operations, was 158 men murdered, sixteen wounded and forty-one scalped. Three scouts were killed, fourteen women outraged, one man was captured, four women and twenty-four children were carried off. Nearly all of these losses occurred in what we then called western Kansas, although the Saline, Solomon and Republican do not seem so very far west now&quot;.

On August 19, 1868, Colonel Edward W. Wynkoop, Indian Agent for the Cheyenne and Arapaho at Fort Larned, Kansas, , a chief in Black Kettle&#x27;s Cheyenne village. Little Rock told what he had learned about the raids along the Saline and Solomon rivers. According to Little Rock&#x27;s account, a war party of about 200 Cheyenne from a camp above the forks of Walnut Creek departed camp intending to go out against the Pawnee. Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle&#x27;s camp. Little Rock learned from them what took place. Little Rock identified the warriors most responsible for the raids and agreed to try to have them delivered to white authorities.

=== Winter camps on the Washita River===
By early November 1868, Black Kettle&#x27;s camp joined other Southern Cheyenne and other tribal bands at the Washita River, which they called Lodgepole River, after local pine trees. Black Kettle&#x27;s village was the westernmost of a series of winter camps, of Cheyenne, Arapaho, Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa-Apache bands, that ran ten to 15 miles along the Washita River.

Black Kettle&#x27;s village was several miles west of the rest of the camps and consisted of around 50 Cheyenne lodges, plus one or two lodges of visiting Arapaho and two of visiting Lakota, for a total of about 250 inhabitants. Little Rock, the only council chief who had remained with Black Kettle since the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864, lived with his family in the village. It also included the families of Big Man, Wolf Looking Back, Clown, Cranky Man, Scabby Man, Half Leg, Bear Tongue, and Roll Down.

Downriver from Black Kettle&#x27;s camp, the Washita River looped northward in a large oxbow. At its northern portion was the Arapaho camp of Little Raven, Big Mouth, Yellow Bear, and Spotted Wolf, a total of about 180 lodges. At the bottom of the loop was a large Southern Cheyenne camp under Medicine Arrows. Followers of Little Robe, Sand Hill, Stone Calf, Old Little Wolf (Big Jake), and Black White Man made up one large village, and nearby was a smaller Cheyenne village consisting of the followers of Old Whirlwind. These two Cheyenne villages, together comprising about 129 lodges, were situated along the oxbow southeast of Little Raven&#x27;s Arapaho camp and west of a small Kiowa camp headed by Kicking Bird.

The Kiowa leaders Satanta, Lone Wolf, and Black Eagle had moved their villages to the Fort Cobb area. Downriver were other camps of Comanche and Kiowa-Apache. Overall, a total of about 6,000 Native Americans were in winter camp along the upper Washita River.

In mid-November, a party headed by Black Kettle and Little Robe of the Cheyenne, and Big Mouth and Spotted Wolf of the Arapaho, arrived at Fort Cobb to visit the post trader, William &quot;Dutch Bill&quot; Griffenstein. Griffenstein&#x27;s wife Cheyenne Jennie, a Cheyenne originally of Black Kettle&#x27;s camp, had died around October 10. Griffenstein had sent runners to inform her parents of her death, perhaps also sending a message to urge Black Kettle to come to talk with Colonel (Brevet Major General) William B. Hazen about making peace. The four chiefs met with Hazen on November 20, with Captain Henry Alvord of the Tenth Cavalry documenting the conversations.

Black Kettle began by saying to Hazen, &quot;The Cheyennes, when south of the Arkansas, do not wish to return to the north side because they feared trouble there, but were continually told that they had better go there, as they would be rewarded for so doing.&quot; Hardoff notes that by the terms of the Medicine Lodge Treaty, the Cheyenne-Arapaho reservation had the Arkansas River as its northern boundary. In April 1868, the U.S. Army distributed food provisions due the Cheyenne and Arapaho at Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, both north of the Arkansas. On August 9, 1868, they had distributed treaty annuities in the form of arms and ammunition at Fort Larned rather than south of the Arkansas.

Black Kettle continued, asking if he might move his people south to Fort Cobb:

The Cheyennes do not fight at all this side of the Arkansas; they do not trouble Texas, but north of the Arkansas they are almost always at war. When lately north of the Arkansas, some young Cheyennes were fired upon and then the fight began. I have always done my best to keep my young men quiet, but some will not listen, and since the fighting began I have not been able to keep them all at home. But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp. My camp is now on the Washita, 40 miles east of the Antelope Hills, and I have there about 180 lodges. I speak only for my own people; I cannot speak nor control the Cheyenne north of the Arkansas.

Big Mouth of the Arapaho spoke next, saying in part:

I never would have gone north of the Arkansas again, but my father there [the agent] sent for me time after time, saying it was the place for my people, and finally I went. No sooner had we got there than there was trouble. I do not want war, and my people do not, but although we have come back south of the Arkansas, the soldiers follow us and continue fighting, and we want you to send out and stop these soldiers from coming against us.

Hazen&#x27;s October 13 orders from General William Tecumseh Sherman, commander of the Military Division of the Missouri, had charged Hazen with making provision for Native Americans who wanted to stay out of the war. The orders stated if General Philip Sheridan had to invade the reservation to pursue hostile Native Americans, he needed to spare the &quot;well-disposed&quot;. Sherman recommended that non-belligerent Native Americans camp near Fort Cobb. Hazen knew that Sheridan had already declared the Cheyenne and Arapaho to be &quot;hostile&quot;, meaning they were subject to attack by the U.S. Army. Hazen told the four chiefs he could not make peace with them. He recommended against their coming to Fort Cobb, as their presence would jeopardize the peace of the Kiowa and Comanche already camped there. He told them,

I am sent here as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and he has all the soldiers who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must go back to your country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him you must make peace.

Reporting to Sherman on November 22, Hazen said, &quot;[T]o have made peace with them would have brought to my camp most of those now on the war path south of the Arkansas; and as General Sheridan is to punish those at war and might follow them in afterwards, a second Chivington affair might occur, which I could not prevent.&quot; Hazen reported that while the chiefs seemed sincere, the Kiowa and Comanche at Fort Cobb said the young warriors who accompanied the chiefs were pleased that peace had not been made. They boasted that the Lakota and other northern bands would come down the following spring to &quot;clean out the entire country.&quot; Hazen took the young warriors&#x27; boasts so seriously that he requested two more companies of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Arbuckle and two howitzers to remain for a week or two at Fort Cobb.

=== Black Kettle&#x27;s return to the Washita ===
Black Kettle and the other chiefs departed Fort Cobb on about November 21 with food supplied by Griffenstein, traveling through storm conditions. They reached their villages on the Washita on the evening of November 26.

The evening before, on November 25, a war party of as many as 150 warriors, which included young men of the camps of Black Kettle, Medicine Arrows, Little Robe, and Old Whirlwind, had returned to the Washita encampments. They had raided white settlements in the Smoky Hill River country with the Dog Soldiers.

Major Joel Elliott of the Seventh Cavalry found the trail of the raiders on November 26, which drew Custer and his forces to the Washita. On November 26, the same day that Black Kettle returned to the Washita, a party of Kiowa returning from raiding the Utes passed through Black Kettle&#x27;s camp on their way to their own village. They told the Cheyenne that as they had passed near the Antelope Hills on the Canadian River, they had seen a large trail leading southward toward the Washita camps. The Cheyenne discounted the information, as they did not believe U.S. soldiers would operate so far south in such wintry conditions. The Kiowa proceeded to their own village further east along the river, but Trails the Enemy decided to stay overnight with friends in Black Kettle&#x27;s camp.

Also on November 26, Crow Neck, a returning warrior, told Bad Man (also known as Cranky Man) that he had left an exhausted horse along the trail to rest. When he went back to retrieve the horse that day, he saw moving figures to the north who looked like soldiers. Fearful, he turned back without getting his horse. Bad Man doubted Crow Neck had seen soldiers; he said perhaps he had a guilty conscience from having gone against the chiefs&#x27; wishes by joining the war party. Crow Neck told no one else what he had seen, fearing that he might be laughed at, or chastised by Black Kettle for having been part of the raid.

On the evening of November 26, Black Kettle held a council in his lodge with the principal men of his village to convey what he had learned at Fort Cobb about Sheridan&#x27;s war plans. Discussion lasted into the early morning hours of November 27. The council decided that after the foot-deep snow cleared, they would send out runners to talk with the soldiers. They wanted to clear up misunderstandings and make it clear that Black Kettle&#x27;s people wanted peace. Meanwhile, they decided to move camp the next day downriver to be closer to the other Indian camps.

According to Moving Behind Woman, who was about 14 at the time of the attack at the Washita camp, Black Kettle&#x27;s wife Medicine Woman stood outside the lodge for a long time. She was angry that the camp was not moving that night, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t like this delay, we could have moved long ago. The Agent sent word for us to leave at once. It seems we are crazy and deaf, and cannot hear.&quot; Black Hawk&#x27;s brother White Shield (also known as Gentle Horse) had a vision of a wolf wounded on the right side of its head mourning its little ones, which had been scattered and killed by a powerful enemy. He tried to persuade Black Kettle to move camp immediately, but was unsuccessful. But five of Black Kettle&#x27;s children (four daughters and a son) moved to the camp of Black Kettle&#x27;s nephew Whirlwind, which was ten miles downriver (five miles straight-line distance).

==Sheridan&#x27;s offensive==
General Philip Sheridan, in command of the U.S. Army&#x27;s Department of the Missouri, decided upon a winter campaign against the Cheyenne. While difficult, a winter campaign offered chances for decisive results, since it was the only time of year the Plains Indians were immobilized. If their shelter, food, and livestock could be destroyed or captured, not only the warriors but their women and children would be at the mercy of both the Army and the elements. They would be forced to surrender. Sheridan planned to have three columns converge on the Indian wintering grounds just east of the Texas Panhandle: one from Fort Lyon in Colorado, one from Fort Bascom in New Mexico, and one from a supply camp to be established (Camp Supply). There, Lt. Col. George A. Custer commanded the 7th Cavalry&#x27;s 800 soldiers against the various bands on the Washita River. They set out on November 23, 1868, in the midst of heavy snow, and headed south.

==Custer&#x27;s attack==

On November 26, 1868, Custer&#x27;s Osage scouts located the trail of an Indian war party. Custer&#x27;s troops followed this trail all day without a break until nightfall, when they rested briefly until there was sufficient moonlight to continue. They followed the trail to Black Kettle&#x27;s village, where Custer divided his force into four parts, moving each into position so that at first daylight they could simultaneously converge on the village. At daybreak, as the columns attacked, Double Wolf awoke and fired his gun to alert the village; he was among the first to die in the charge. The cavalry musicians played &quot;Garryowen&quot; to signal the attack. The Cheyenne warriors hurriedly left their lodges to take cover behind trees and in deep ravines. Custer soon controlled the village, but it took longer to quell all remaining resistance.

The Osage, enemies to the Cheyenne, were at war with most of the Plains tribes. The Osage scouts led Custer toward the village, hearing sounds and smelling smoke from the camp long before the soldiers. The Osage did not participate in the initial attack, fearing that the soldiers would mistake them for Cheyenne and shoot them. Instead, they waited behind the color-bearer of the 7th US Cavalry on the north side of the river until the village was taken. The Osage rode into the village, where they took scalps and helped the soldiers round up fleeing Cheyenne women and children.

Black Kettle and his wife, Medicine Woman, were shot in the back and killed while fleeing on a pony. Following the capture of Black Kettle&#x27;s village, Custer was in a precarious position. As the fighting began to subside, he saw large groups of mounted Indians gathering on nearby hilltops and learned that Black Kettle&#x27;s village was only one of many Indian encampments along the river, where thousands of Indians had gathered. Fearing an attack, he ordered some of his men to take defensive positions while the others seized the Indians&#x27; property and horses. They destroyed what they did not want or could not carry, slaughtering about 675 ponies and horses. They spared 200 horses to carry prisoners.

Near nightfall, fearing the outlying Indians would find and attack his supply train, Custer began marching his forces toward the other encampments. The surrounding Indians retreated, at which point Custer turned around and returned to his supply train.

In his first report of the battle to Gen. Sheridan on November 28, 1868, Custer reported that by &quot;actual and careful examination after the battle&quot;, his men had found the bodies of 103 warriorsa figure repeated by Sheridan when he relayed news of the Washita fight to Bvt. Maj. Gen. W.A. Nichols the following day. In fact, no count of the dead had been made. The reported number was based on Custer&#x27;s reports from his officers the day after the attack, during their return to Camp Supply. Cheyenne and other Indian estimates of the Indian casualties at the Washita, as well as estimates by Custer&#x27;s civilian scouts, are much lower.

According to a modern account by the U.S. Army Center of Military History, the 7th Cavalry had 21 officers and men killed and 13 wounded at the Washita. They estimated the Indians had perhaps 50 killed and as many wounded. Twenty of the soldiers killed were part of a small detachment led by Major Joel Elliott, who was among the dead. Elliott had separated from the three companies he led, apparently without Custer&#x27;s approval. Yelling &quot;Here&#x27;s for a brevet or a coffin!&quot;, Elliott and his small band pursued a group of fleeing Cheyenne. Elliott&#x27;s contingent ran into a mixed party of Cheyenne, Kiowa, and Arapaho warriors who were rushing from villages up the river to aid Black Kettle&#x27;s encampment. The warriors overwhelmed the small troop in a single charge.

Custer&#x27;s abrupt withdrawal without determining the fate of Elliott and the missing troopers darkened Custer&#x27;s reputation among his peers. There was deep resentment within the 7th Cavalry that never healed. In particular, Frederick Benteen, Eliott&#x27;s friend and H Company captain, never forgave Custer for &quot;abandoning&quot; Elliott and his troopers. Eight years later, when Benteen failed to race to Custer&#x27;s aid at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, his actions were closely examined in light of his long-standing anger toward Custer for the events at the Washita River.

==Role of Indian noncombatants in Custer&#x27;s strategy==
The Southern Cheyenne encampment on the Washita River comprised a key component in Custer&#x27;s field strategyIndian noncombatants included many women, children, and the elderly or disabled. Custer targeted them for capture to serve as hostages and human shields. Custer&#x27;s battalions intended to &quot;ride into the camp and secure noncombatant hostages&quot; and &quot;forc[e] the warriors to surrender&quot;. Custer demonstrated the value at the Battle of the Washita of a strategy that used &quot;capture[d] women and children&quot; to &quot;neutralize&quot; the Southern Cheyenne superiority in numbers over the US military.

Author James Donovan describes the 53 women and children seized at the Washita as &quot;captives&quot; or &quot;prisoners.&quot; They were used by Custer to ensure the escape of his regiment as Cheyenne forces from nearby villages began &quot;pressing his position&quot;. Historian Jerome Greene spelled out their function: &quot;... fifty-three women and children taken captive at the Washita served as assurance against attack from the downriver [Indians] during Custer&#x27;s extrication of his command from the scene late on November 27.&quot; As Custer advanced with his regiment in a mock assaultmounted women and children hostages riding among his troopsthe warriors dispersed, &quot;afraid that shots directed against the column might hit the prisoners&quot;.

Larry Sklenar, in his narrative of the Washita battle, also describes the role of &quot;hostages&quot; as human shields:
Custer probably could not have pulled off this tactical coup [at the Washita] had he not had in his possession the fifty-some women and children captives. Although not hostages in the narrowest meaning of the word, doubtlessly it occurred to Custer that the family-oriented [Cheyenne] warriors would not attack the Seventh [Cavalry] with the women and children marching in [the middle of his column].

Custer provided the military logic for tactical use of human shields in his book &quot;My Life on the Plains&quot;, published two years before the Battle of the Little Big Horn:
Indians contemplating a battle, either offensive or defensive, are always anxious to have their women and children removed from all danger…For this reason I decided to locate our [military] camp as close as convenient to [Chief Black Kettle&#x27;s Cheyenne] village, knowing that the close proximity of their women and children, and their necessary exposure in case of conflict, would operate as a powerful argument in favor of peace, when the question of peace or war came to be discussed.

General Phil Sheridan, commander of the Department of the Missouri, issued orders for the Washita River expedition, including the following: &quot;to destroy [Indian] villages and ponies, to kill or hang all warriors, and to bring back all woman and children [survivors].&quot; The purpose of this &quot;total war&quot; strategy was to make &quot;all segments of Indian society experience the horrors of war as fully as the warriors&quot;.

Benjamin &quot;Ben&quot; Clark, the highly regarded scout and guide attached to the Seventh Cavalry, recalled that women and children were not spared being killed at the Washita: &quot;[T]he regiment galloped through the tepees ... firing indiscriminately and killing men and women alike.&quot; One cavalry unit was seen pursuing &quot;a group of women and children,&quot; shooting at them and &quot;killing them without mercy&quot;. Lieutenant Edward Godfrey observed that soldiers made no effort &quot;to prevent hitting women&quot; during the attack.

Ben Clark reported &quot;the loss of seventy-five [Cheyenne] warriors dead, and fully as many women and children killed&quot;. Greene notes that &quot;all warriors who lay wounded in the villagepresumably no matter the extent of their injuries&quot; were (according to Clark&#x27;s testimony) &quot;promptly shot to death&quot;. This was consistent with Sheridan&#x27;s orders to kill or summarily hang all [captured] warriors. The Seventh Cavalry tactical engagement of noncombatants contributed to the effective &quot;destruction&quot; of Black Kettle&#x27;s villageit &quot;ceased to exist&quot;.

Colonel Ranald Mackenzie, with elements of the Fourth Cavalry, emulated the successand methodsof the Battle of the Washita in the lead-up to the Red River War at the battle of North Fork, near McClellan Creek, Texas, in 1872. Applying similar tactics of taking captives, Mackenzie&#x27;s command of 284 men attacked a Comanche village of 262 lodges and 500 warriors, capturing 130 women and children. The captives served both as human shields, as Mackenzie withdrew to his supply base, and as hostages, offered as a &quot;bargaining tool to force the off-reservation Indians back to reservation, and to force them to free white captives&quot;.

==Controversies==

=== Indian casualties at the Washita ===
The number of Indian casualties at the Washita reported by Custer has been controversial. In his first report of the battle to Gen. Sheridan on November 28, 1868, Custer reported that by &quot;actual and careful examination after the battle,&quot; the bodies of 103 warriors were founda figure echoed by Sheridan when from Camp Supply he relayed news of the Washita fight to Bvt. Maj. Gen. W.A. Nichols the following day. In fact, no battlefield count of the dead was made. According to Lt. Edward S. Godfrey, no estimate of Indian warrior fatalities was made until the evening of the day following the battle, after the soldiers made camp during their march back to Camp Supply. &quot;On [the] second night [after the battle],&quot; Godfrey told interviewer Walter M. Camp in 1917, &quot;Custer interrogated the officers as to what Indians they had seen dead in the village, and it was from these reports that the official report of Indians killed was made up. The dead Indians on the field were not counted by the troops then, but guessed at later, as explained.&quot;

In his 1928 memoir, Godfrey related, &quot;After supper in the evening, the officers were called together and each one questioned as to the casualties of enemy warriors, locations, etc. Every effort was made to avoid duplications. The total was found to be one hundred and three.&quot; Captain Benteen stated, in annotations to his personal copy of W.L. Holloway&#x27;s &quot;Wild Life on the Plains and Horrors of Indian Warfare&quot;, that &quot;Custer assembled the officers to inquire of each how many dead Indians &quot;each&quot; had seen; then what each had seen were added. &quot;They had all seen the same dead Indians&quot;.&quot; [emphasis in original].

John Poisal and Jack Fitzpatrick, mixed-blood scouts attached to the Seventh Cavalry, reported a different number of Indian casualties to scout J.S. Morrison when they arrived at Fort Dodge with the Cheyenne prisoners. In a letter to Indian Agent Col. Edward W. Wynkoop on December 14, 1868, Morrison wrote,

John Smith, John Poysell [Poisal], and Jack Fitzpatrick have got in today. John S. was not in the [Washita] fight, but John P. and Jack were. They all agree in stating that the official reports of the fight were very much exaggerated; that there were not over twenty bucks killed; the rest, about 40, were women and children.The Cheyenne prisoners, interviewed by Gen. Sheridan at Camp Supply, reported 13 Cheyenne men, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed at the Washita, a figure which Sheridan subsequently reported to Bvt. Maj. Gen. Nichols. The journalist DeB. Randolph Keim interviewed the women prisoners with the help of interpreter Richard Curtis. He obtained the names of those killed and arrived at the same figure of 13 Cheyenne, two Sioux, and one Arapaho killed. Later information from various Cheyenne sources, most of them independent of each other, tended to confirm the figures given by the Cheyenne women prisoners. Few of the military reports noted casualties among the women and children. Custer acknowledged in his report, &quot;In the excitement of the fight, as well as in self-defence, it so happened that some of the squaws and a few of the children were killed and wounded...&quot;

After Custer and Sheridan visited the battlefield in December, Custer revised his initial estimate of 103 warriors killed upward. He wrote from Fort Cobb,
The Indians admit a loss of 140 killed, besides a heavy loss of wounded. This, with the Indian prisoners we have in our possession, makes the entire loss of the Indian in killed, wounded, and missing not far from 300.

Hoig points out that if true, the number would mean that virtually everyone in Black Kettle&#x27;s village was killed or captured. Greene states, &quot;Custer&#x27;s figures were inflated, and the specific sources of his information remain unknown.&quot;

Hardorff notes questions about this total.
This new number was based on information obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, it seems likely that these men would have said anything to avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted in the case of the Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.

Greene finds the Cheyenne and other Indian estimates most reliable. He writes, &quot;As might be expected, the best estimates must come from the people who suffered the losses,&quot; though noting, &quot;even these do not agree.&quot; Utley, however, writes, &quot;Indian calculationsa dozen warriors and twice as many women and children killedare as improbably low as Custer&#x27;s are high.&quot; Hoig writes, &quot;Even though the number 103 was not arrived at by a precise battlefield count, it is a definite figure which has already been placed on historical markers of the battlefield. Since it will likely never be proved absolutely incorrect, the figure will undoubtedly remain accepted as the number of Indians killed by Custer at the Washita. History should make it clear, however, that the dead were by no means all warriors who were met in open battle and defeated.&quot;

Several of the Cheyenne accounts provide names of men killed at the Washita. In his book on the Washita, Greene provides an appendix of &quot;Known Village Fatalities at the Washita.&quot; He compiled a list of all unique names, for a total of 40 men, 12 women (of whom 11 are unidentified), and six unidentified children. Greene notes that some individuals might have more than one name, so some entries might be duplicates. Using the same sources, Richard G. Hardorff has compiled a &quot;Composite List of Names.&quot; It partially reconciles multiple names (or multiple translations of the same name) among the different sources; for example, the Mexican &quot;Pilan&quot;, with Indian names White Bear and Tall White Man; or Bitter Man/Cranky Man, also known as Bad Man. Writes Hardorff, &quot;Some of the dead may have been identified by their birth name by one informant and by their nickname by another. Variations in the translation of personal names add to the confusion in the identification...&quot;

===Battle or massacre?===
Following the event, a controversy arose as to whether the event was best described as a military victory or as a massacre. This discussion endures among historians to this day.

The Indian Bureau described the event as a &quot;massacre of innocent Indians&quot;, and humanitarian groups denounced it as &quot;cold-blooded butchery&quot;. The Cheyenne survivors considered it a horrifying event that gravely impacted their lives and community; the loss of many tribal elders, in particular, was profoundly damaging to Cheyenne families and society. Modern Cheyenne consider the event a massacre and are campaigning to change the name of the historical site to reflect that view.

Custer himself did not consider Washita a massacre, stating that he did not kill every Indian in the village, though he said his forces could not avoid killing a few women in the middle of the hard fight. He said that some women took up weapons and were subsequently killed and that he took women and children prisoners. In his book about the encounter, published in 2004 for the National Park Service, historian Jerome Greene concluded that &quot;Soldiers evidently took measures to protect the women and children.&quot;

By early December 1868, the attack had provoked debate and criticism in the press. In the December 9 &quot;Leavenworth Evening Bulletin&quot;, an article noted: &quot;Gen. S. Sandford and Tappan, and Col. Taylor of the Indian Peace Commission, unite in the opinion that the late battle with the Indians was simply an attack upon peaceful bands, which were on the march to their new reservations&quot;. The December 14 &quot;New York Tribune&quot; reported, &quot;Col. Wynkoop, agent for the Cheyenne and Arapahos Indians, has published his letter of resignation. He regards Gen. Custer&#x27;s late fight as simply a massacre, and says that Black Kettle and his band, friendly Indians, were, when attacked, on their way to their reservation.&quot; The scout James S. Morrison wrote Indian Agent Col. Wynkoop that twice as many women and children as warriors had been killed during the attack.

In Custer&#x27;s direct frontal assault on an armed and ostensibly hostile encampment, the only fatality in the 7th Cavalry in the fighting in the village itself was squadron commander Captain Louis McLane Hamilton, a grandson of American founding father Alexander Hamilton. The rest of the dead were with the detached command of Maj. Joel Elliott, who (as noted above) were killed more than a mile from the fighting in the village. Companies A and D, composed of 120 officers and men, suffered only four wounded in the assault, and attacking Companies C and K, also totaling 120 officers and men, suffered no casualties.

Historian Paul Andrew Hutton wrote, &quot;Although the fight on the Washita was most assuredly one-sided, it was not a massacre. Black Kettle&#x27;s Cheyennes were not unarmed innocents living under the impression that they were not at war. Several of Black Kettle&#x27;s warriors had recently fought the soldiers, and the chief had been informed by Hazen that there could be no peace until he surrendered to Sheridan. The soldiers were not under orders to kill everyone, for Custer personally stopped the slaying of noncombatants, and fifty-three prisoners were taken by the troops.&quot;

Historian Joseph B. Thoburn considers the destruction of Black Kettle&#x27;s village too one-sided to be called a battle. He reasons that had a superior force of Indians attacked a white settlement containing no more people than were in Black Kettle&#x27;s camp, with like results, the incident would doubtless have been heralded as &quot;a massacre&quot;. Historian Stan Hoig argues that the conflict fit the definition of a massacre because a group of people, even one in possession of weapons as the Cheyenne were, were killed &quot;indiscriminately, mercilessly and in large numbers&quot;.

==In popular culture==
During the late 20th century, a time of activism for Native American and minority civil rights, and protests about the Vietnam War, film and other media reflected changes in historians&#x27; perspective on the Battle of Washita River. They also used the event to reflect on contemporary issues. In the 1970 film &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, based on the 1964 novel by Thomas Berger, director Arthur Penn depicted the Seventh Cavalry&#x27;s attack on Black Kettle&#x27;s village on the Washita as a massacre resembling the 1968 My Lai massacre by U.S. troops in Vietnam.

John Jakes described the battle as a massacre in the final book of the &quot;North and South&quot; trilogy, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, published in 1987.

The 1991 television film &quot;Son of the Morning Star&quot;, based on Evan S. Connell&#x27;s non-fiction book of the same name, presented the battle from the points of view of Kate Bighead (Cheyenne) and Elizabeth Custer. It depicted Chief Black Kettle as being killed by Custer&#x27;s troopers, and Custer&#x27;s not waiting for word of Major Elliott. The fourth episode of the 2005 TV miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot; depicts Custer attacking and Black Kettle fleeing the village.

The television series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; aired a special double-episode entitled &quot;Washita&quot; on April 29, 1995. The episode set the scene of the Washita attack in Colorado instead of Oklahoma, the site of the battle. It fictionalized Custer as deliberately misleading Colorado settlers about the difference between Black Kettle and his band, depicted as peaceful, and the Dog Soldiers, who were attacking farms and railroad crews. Lead character Dr. Michaela &quot;Mike&quot; Quinn made futile attempts to argue with Custer and to warn Black Kettle of impending massacre.

In the 2003 film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a veteran of the 7th Cavalry of the 1860s. His participation in the Washita action, depicted as a massacre, leaves him haunted by nightmares.

In season 6, episode 2 of the television show &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Incident of the Iron Bull&quot;, James Whitmore plays a mythical colonel who commanded the US troopers at Washita. His participation leaves him mentally unbalanced.

<doc id="514642" wikidata="Q1063937" url="?curid=514642" title="Pitch (baseball)">
<text>In baseball, the pitch is the act of throwing the baseball toward home plate to start a play. The term comes from the Knickerbocker Rules. Originally, the ball had to be thrown underhand, much like &quot;pitching in horseshoes&quot;. Overhand pitching was not allowed in baseball until 1884.

The biomechanics of pitching have been studied extensively. The phases of pitching include the windup, early cocking, late cocking, early acceleration, late acceleration, deceleration, and follow-through.

Pitchers throw a variety of pitches, each of which has a slightly different velocity, trajectory, movement, hand position, wrist position and/or arm angle. These variations are introduced to confuse the batter and ultimately aid the defensive team in getting the batter or baserunners out. To obtain variety, and therefore enhance defensive baseball strategy, the pitcher manipulates the grip on the ball at the point of release. Variations in the grip cause the seams to catch the air differently, thereby changing the trajectory of the ball, making it harder for the batter to hit.

The selection of which pitch to use can depend on the type of hitter who is being faced; whether there are any base runners; how many outs have been made in the inning; and the existing score. Pitchers may bounce their pitches in the dirt before they reach the batter, but these pitches are ruled balls even if they pass through the strike zone.

==Signaling==
The responsibility for selecting the type of pitch is traditionally made by the catcher, who gives hand signals to the pitcher with his fingers, usually one finger for fastball or the pitcher&#x27;s best pitch, with the pitcher having the option to ask for another selection by shaking his head.

Alternatively, the manager or a coach relays the pitch selection to the catcher, via secret hand signals, to prevent the opposing team from having the advantage of knowing what the next pitch will be.

==Fastballs==
The fastball is the most common pitch in baseball, and most pitchers have some form of a fastball in their arsenal. Most pitchers throw four-seam fastballs. It is basically a pitch thrown very fast, generally as hard as a given pitcher can throw while maintaining control. Some variations involve movement or breaking action, some do not and are simply straight, high-speed pitches. While throwing the fastball it is very important to have proper mechanics, because this increases the chance of getting the ball to its highest velocity, making it difficult for the opposing player to hit the pitch. The cut fastball, split-finger fastball, and forkball are variations on the fastball with extra movement, and are sometimes called sinking-fastballs because of the trajectories. The most common fastball pitches are:

* Cutter
* Four-seam fastball
* Sinker
* Split-finger fastball
* Two-seam fastball

==Breaking balls==

Well-thrown breaking balls have movement, usually sideways or downward. A ball moves due to the changes in the pressure of the air surrounding the ball as a result of the kind of pitch thrown. Therefore, the ball keeps moving in the path of least resistance, which constantly changes. For example, the spin from a properly thrown slider (thrown by a right-handed pitcher) results in lower air pressure on the pitcher&#x27;s left side, resulting in the ball moving to the left (from the pitcher&#x27;s perspective). The goal is usually to make the ball difficult to hit by confusing the batters. Most breaking balls are considered off-speed pitches. The most common breaking pitches are:

* 12–6 curveball
* Curveball
* Knuckle curve
* Screwball
* Slider
* Slurve

==Changeups==
The changeup is an off-speed pitch, usually thrown to look like a fastball, but arriving much slower to the plate. Its reduced speed coupled with its deceptive delivery is meant to confuse the batter&#x27;s timing. It is thrown the same as a fastball, but simply further back in the hand, which makes it release from the hand slower, but still retaining the look of a fastball. A changeup is generally thrown 8–15 miles per hour slower than a fastball. If thrown correctly, the changeup will confuse the batter because the human eye cannot discern that the ball is coming significantly slower until it is around 30 feet from the plate. For example, a batter swings at the ball as if it was a 90 mph fastball, but it is coming at 75 mph which means he is swinging too early to hit the ball well, making the changeup very effective. The most common changeups are:

* Circle changeup
* Forkball
* Fosh
* Palmball
* Straight changeup
* Vulcan changeup

==Other pitches==
Other pitches which are or have been used in baseball are:

* Gyroball
* Junk pitches
** Eephus pitch
** Knuckleball
* Shuuto
* Illegal pitches
** Beanball
** Emery ball
** Shine ball
** Spitball
* Purpose pitches
** Brushback pitch
** Pickoff
** Pitchout

==Pitching deliveries==
The most common pitching delivery is the three-quarters delivery. Other deliveries include the submarine (underhand) and the sidearm deliveries. There is also the crossfire pitch, which only works for sidearm delivery.

A pickoff move is the motion the pitcher goes through in making pickoff.

==Pitching positions==
There are two legal pitching positions:
*the windup
*the set which is often referred to as the stretch.
Typically, pitchers from the set use a high leg kick, but may instead release the ball more quickly by using the slide step.

== See also ==

* First-pitch strike
* Bowling, the equivalent in cricket
** Throwing (cricket), an illegal action in cricket similar to baseball pitching
* Pitch (softball)

<text>The 1973 Quebec general election was held on October 29, 1973 to elect members to National Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Premier Robert Bourassa, won re-election, defeating the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;, led by René Lévesque, and the &quot;Union Nationale&quot; (UN).

The Liberals won the largest majority government in the province&#x27;s history, with 102 seats. In the process, they reduced the opposition to just eight seats (six PQ, two créditistes) in total. The &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; held its own, losing only one seat, and despite having fewer seats, became the official Opposition, although PQ leader René Lévesque failed to win a seat in the Assembly.

The &quot;Union Nationale,&quot; which had held power until the previous 1970 general election, was wiped off the electoral map, losing all 17 of its seats. It would be the first time since the UN&#x27;s founding in 1935 that the party was without representation in the legislature. However, UN candidate Maurice Bellemare later won a seat in a 1974 by-election.

The popular vote was not as lopsided as the seat count would indicate, even though the Liberals won 54 percent of the popular vote. The Parti Québécois, for instance, won 30% of the popular vote, a significant improvement over their previous showing of 23% in the 1970 election. However, their support was spread out across the entire province, and was not concentrated in enough areas to translate into more seats. Quebec elections have historically produced significant disparities in seat counts.

==Legislative reforms (19701973)==
===Abolition of protected ridings===
Upon Confederation in 1867, section 80 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot; provided for the following ridings in the Legislative Assembly to be protected from having their boundaries altered without the consent of the majority of the members representing them:

* Argenteuil
* Brome
* Compton
* Huntingdon
* Mégantic
* Missisquoi
* Ottawa
** Labelle was carved out in 1912
*** Papineau was carved out from Labelle in 1922
** Ottawa was divided into Hull and Papineau in 1919
* Pontiac
** Témiscaming was carved out in 1912
*** Abitibi was carved out from Témiscamingue in 1922
* Richmond and Wolfe (divided into Richmond and Wolfe in 1890)
* Shefford
* Sherbrooke
* Stanstead

Consent by a majority of the members of the 18 districts concerned was finally secured in December 1970, and the constitutional restrictions were accordingly revoked. Work would then proceed on a comprehensive redistribution for the next ensuing election.

===Redistribution of ridings===
A 1972 Act increased the number of MNAs from 108 to 110 through the following changes:


==Campaign==
The Liberals, Unionists and &quot;péquistes&quot; all fielded full slates, while the &quot;créditistes&quot; failed to nominate a candidate only in Saint-Laurent (because a traffic accident prevented that candidate from presenting his nomination papers before the deadline), so virtually all constituencies experienced at least four-way contests:

<doc id="514650" wikidata="Q1395645" url="?curid=514650" title="Secondary mirror">
<text>A secondary mirror (or secondary) is the second deflecting or focusing mirror element in a reflecting telescope. Light gathered by the primary mirror is directed towards a focal point typically past the location of the secondary. Secondary mirrors in the form of an optically flat &quot;diagonal mirror&quot; are used to re-direct the light path in designs such as Newtonian reflectors. They are also used to re-direct and extend the light path and modify the final image in designs such as Cassegrain reflectors.

The secondary is typically suspended by X-shaped struts (sometimes called a &quot;spider&quot;) in the path of light between the source and the primary, but can be mounted on other types of mounts or optical elements such as optical windows, or schmidt and meniscus corrector plates. Employing secondary mirrors in optical systems causes some image distortion due to the obstruction of the secondary itself, and distortion from the spider mounts, commonly seen as cross-shaped diffraction spikes radiating from bright stars seen in astronomical images.

For large telescopes, the secondary mirror can reach a significant size. At the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the secondary for the Simonyi Survey Telescope is nearly four meters in diameter.

<text>The 1970 Quebec general election was held on April 29, 1970, to elect members of the National Assembly of Quebec. The former Legislative Assembly had been renamed the &quot;National Assembly&quot; in 1968, with its members now known in English as Members of the National Assembly (MNAs). 

In the election, the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Robert Bourassa, defeated the incumbent Union Nationale, led by Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand.

This election marked the first appearance by a new party, the sovereigntist Parti Québécois, led by former Liberal cabinet minister René Lévesque. The PQ won a modest seven seats and came second in the popular vote, although Lévesque was defeated in his own riding.

Only a few months after the election, Quebec faced a severe test with the October Crisis, in which Liberal cabinet minister Pierre Laporte was kidnapped and assassinated by the Front de libération du Québec, a violent pro-independence group.

The Union Nationale, which had governed Quebec through most of the 1940s and 1950s, would never come close to winning power again. This was partly because a significant number of the Union Nationale&#x27;s younger supporters had embraced sovereigntism and shifted their support to the PQ.

==Campaign==
The Liberals, Unionists and &quot;péquistes&quot; all fielded full slates, and the &quot;créditistes&quot; also nominated 99 candidates, so most constituencies experienced at least four-way contests:

<text>The 1966 Quebec general election was held on June 5, 1966, to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, Canada. The Union Nationale (UN), led by Daniel Johnson, Sr, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Jean Lesage.

In terms of the number of seats won, the election was one of the closest in recent history, with the UN winning 56 seats to the Liberals&#x27; 50. Generally, Quebec&#x27;s first past the post electoral system tends to produce strong disparities in the number of seats won even if the popular vote is fairly close. In this case, the most popular party did not win the most seats in the chamber. The Liberals won 6.5% more votes, but were denied a third term because the rural part of the province, where the Union Nationale did well, were slightly over-represented in the legislature.

The victory of the UN over the popular Lesage government was a surprise to many observers. Johnson&#x27;s campaign was likely helped by his position that Quebec should get a better deal within the Canadian confederation, or should separate if it is unable to do so. In this sense, the forces of Quebec nationalism unleashed by the Quiet Revolution begun by Lesage may have contributed to his defeat, as many rural voters felt chagrin at the rapid pace of reform under the Liberals.

The pro-independence &quot;Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale&quot; and &quot;Ralliement national&quot; (formed from splinter groups out of the RIN and the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot;) obtained a combined total of just under 9% of the popular vote (but no seats).

This was the last election for the &quot;Legislative Assembly of Quebec&quot;. Legislation was passed to replace the bicameral system of Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council of Quebec with a single National Assembly of Quebec, effective December 31, 1968.

Daniel Johnson died in office in 1968, and was succeeded by Jean-Jacques Bertrand. Johnson&#x27;s sons, Pierre-Marc and Daniel Jr, each later served as Premier of Quebec.

<text>The Far East Fleet (also called the Far East Station) was a fleet of the Royal Navy from 1952 to 1971.

During the Second World War, the Eastern Fleet included many ships and personnel from other navies, including the navies of the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, France and the United States. On 22 November 1944 the Eastern Fleet was re-designated East Indies fleet and continued to be based in Trincomalee. Following its re-designation its remaining ships formed the British Pacific Fleet. In December 1945 the British Pacific Fleet was disbanded and its forces were absorbed into the East Indies Fleet. In 1952 The East Indies Fleet was renamed the Far East Fleet. After the Second World War the East Indies Station continued as a separate command to the Far East until 1958. In 1971 the Far East Fleet was abolished and its remaining forces returned home, coming under the command of the new, unified, Commander-in-Chief Fleet.

==Post-war==
After the war, the East Indies Fleet was once again based at the Singapore Naval Base. The 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (HMS &quot;Glory&quot; and ) arrived from the British Pacific Fleet in October 1945, and operated from Trincomalee, then Singapore, from October 1945 to October 1947. In 1952, the East Indies Fleet was redesignated the Far East Fleet. The Fleet then took part in the Malayan Emergency and the confrontation with Indonesia in the 1960s. By 1964, the fleet on station included , , , , , 17 destroyers and frigates, about ten minesweepers and five submarines.

The Flag Officer Second-in-Command Far East Fleet, for most of the postwar period a rear admiral, was based afloat, and tasked with keeping the fleet &quot;up to the mark operationally&quot;. Some also held the appointment of Flag Officer Commanding 5th Cruiser Squadron, probably including Rear Admiral E.G.A. Clifford CB, who was flying his flag in on 12 November 1953. Meanwhile, the fleet commander, a vice admiral, ran the fleet programme and major items of administration &#x27;including all provision for docking and maintenance&#x27; from his base in Singapore.

In the last days of the East Indies Fleet North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, beginning the Korean War. William Andrewes was promoted to vice admiral on 1 December 1950, and on the 17th was made commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron and Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet, flying his flag in the light cruiser . After the outbreak of the Korean War he commanded British and Commonwealth Naval Forces, with the carrier as his flagship. He had two aircraft carriers available at any one time, which he worked in eighteen-day cycles. At times he also led Task Force 91 (comprising all Blockade, Covering Force and Escort ships in Korean waters, affiliated with the United Nations Command) in 1951.

From February 1963 the remaining destroyer and frigate squadrons in the Far East Fleet were gradually amalgamated into Escort Squadrons. All had been disbanded by the end of December 1966. Those in the Far East Fleet became the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Far East Destroyer Squadrons. returned to service in June 1962 assigned to the 3rd Frigate Squadron of the Far East Fleet. She arrived at Colombo in October and was deployed in the Indian Ocean, calling at Diego Garcia and Malé, Maldives. She served with the Far East Fleet until mid-1967 before returning home to be paid off.

In November 1967 fleet senior officers supervised the final departure from Britain&#x27;s beleaguered State of Aden. Rear Admiral Edward Ashmore, Flag Officer, Second-in-Command, Far East Fleet, serving as Commander Task Force 318, commanded the British warships assembled to cover the withdrawal from Aden and receive the final Royal Marine Commandos heli-evacuated from the RAF Khormaksar airfield.

The fleet was disbanded in 1971, and on 31 October 1971, the last day of the validity of the Anglo-Malayan Defence Agreement, the last Commander, Far East Fleet, Rear Admiral Anthony Troup, hauled down his flag.

==Commander-in-Chief, Far East Fleet==
Post holders included:

== Flag Officer Second-in-Command Far East Fleet ==

== Commodore, Amphibious Forces, Far East Fleet ==
Commodore, Amphibious Forces, Far East (COMAFFEF) was based at HMNB Singapore from May 1965 to March 1971.

The Amphibious Warfare Squadron was established in March 1961, which was responsible to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf until August 1962. It then was reassigned to Flag Officer, Middle East, until April 1965. The squadron was then transferred to the Far East where it was renamed Amphibious Forces under the new Commodore, Amphibious Forces, Far East Fleet in May 1965. The post was discontinued in March 1971.

<text>James E. &quot;Jim&quot; Kreuser (born May 20, 1961) is an American politician and former County Executive for Kenosha County, Wisconsin, serving from 2008 to 2022. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously represented Kenosha in the Wisconsin State Assembly for 15 years (1993–2008) and was the Assembly Minority Leader from 2003 through 2008.

==Early life==

James Kreuser was born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He graduated from George Nelson Tremper High School in 1979 and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Kenosha&#x27;s University of Wisconsin–Parkside in 1983. He continued his education at Parkside and received his Master&#x27;s in Public Administration in 1986.

==State Assembly==
During his time at Parkside, Kreuser interned with Kenosha County Executive, John Collins, and, after completing his M.P.A., was hired as a full-time administrative assistant in the county executive&#x27;s office. Kreuser later credited the experience he received working in the county executive&#x27;s office, getting to know the county and state government, with enabling his success as a legislator.

He was still working for the county executive when, in 1993, a chain of events—starting with the appointment of local-area congressman Les Aspin to join the cabinet of newly inaugurated President Bill Clinton—resulted in a vacancy in the Wisconsin State Assembly district in which Kreuser resided. A special election was called for August 1993, and Kreuser was elected. He topped his two Democratic opponents in the primary, carrying just over 50% of the vote, then defeated his Republican general election opponent, William F. Cantwell, by a wide margin.

Kreuser went on to win re-election seven times, receiving attention and praise from his colleagues as an up-and-coming leader in the party. Senate Majority Leader Charles Chvala was quoted as saying Kreuser was, &quot;destined to be a leader.&quot; He made his first bid for leadership in the Assembly Democratic caucus in the summer of 1998, when long-time Democratic leader Walter Kunicki stepped down from the role. Despite strong support from a geographically diverse coalition of the assembly, Kreuser fell one or two votes short of Milwaukee representative Shirley Krug, who became the first female caucus leader in state history.

In 2001, amid discontent within the caucus over the results of the 2000 election, Kreuser made a successful bid with Assistant Minority Leader Spencer Black of Madison, to challenge Krug as floor leader. Black was elevated to Minority Leader and Kreuser was elected as Assistant Minority Leader, in what was seen as a repudiation of the Democratic Leadership Council in Wisconsin.

Black stood down as leader at the end of the 2001-2002 term, and Kreuser was elected just after the 2002 election as the next Minority Leader. Over his three terms as minority leader, Democrats increased from 41 seats in the Assembly to 47.

==County Executive==

In March 2008 another opportunity presented itself to Kreuser when Kenosha County Executive Allan Kehl announced his intention to resign his seat after being indicted for accepting illegal payments. Kreuser quickly jumped into the race, announcing his candidacy on March 25, 2008, and won the special election without opposition in June. At the time he announced his candidacy, he pledged not to run for re-election to the Assembly if he was chosen as County Executive.

Kreuser&#x27;s move to vacate his Assembly leadership role was seen as a blow to Kenosha&#x27;s influence in the state as Democrats were widely expected to win a majority in the upcoming 2008 election, where Kreuser would likely then become a candidate for Speaker or Majority Leader. Kreuser&#x27;s successor as chairman of the Wisconsin Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee, Mark Pocan, went on to an influential career in the Assembly and has been a member of Congress since 2013.

==Personal life and family==
Kreuser has been a member of the Danish Brotherhood in America, the Polish Legion of American Veterans, the American Association of University Women, Ducks Unlimited, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1444. He has been involved with Kenosha organizations such as the Kenosha Sport Fishing and Conservation Association, the Urban League of Racine and Kenosha, the Kenosha Area Chamber of Commerce, the Boys and Girls Club of Kenosha, and the Friends of the Kenosha Public Museum.

He and his wife Jane have two adult sons.
