<text>The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) is a public research university in Syracuse, New York, focused on the environment and natural resources. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. ESF is immediately adjacent to Syracuse University, within which it was founded, and with which it maintains a special relationship. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

ESF operates education and research facilities also in the Adirondack Park (including the Ranger School in Wanakena), the Thousand Islands, elsewhere in Central New York, and Costa Rica. The college&#x27;s curricula focus on the understanding, management, and sustainability of the environment and natural resources.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was established on July 28, 1911, through a bill signed by New York Governor John Alden Dix. The previous year, Governor Charles Hughes had vetoed a bill authorizing such a college. Both bills followed the state&#x27;s defunding in 1903 of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell. Originally a unit of Syracuse University, in 1913, the college was made a separate, legal entity.

Syracuse native and constitutional lawyer Louis Marshall, with a summer residence at Knollwood Club on Saranac Lake and a prime mover for the establishment of the Adirondack and Catskill Forest Preserve (New York), became a Syracuse University Trustee in 1910. He confided in Chancellor James R. Day his desire to have an agricultural and forestry school at the university, and by 1911 his efforts resulted in a New York State bill to fund the project: the aforementioned appropriation bill signed by Governor Dix. Marshall was elected president of the college&#x27;s board of trustees at its first meeting, in 1911; at the time of his death, eighteen years later, he was still president of the board.

The first dean of the college was William L. Bray, a Ph.D., graduate from the University of Chicago, botanist, plant ecologist, biogeographer and Professor of Botany at Syracuse University. In 1907 he was made head of the botany department at Syracuse, and in 1908 he started teaching a forestry course in the basement of Lyman Hall. Bray was an associate of Gifford Pinchot, who was the first Chief of the United States Forest Service. In 1911, in addition to assuming the deanship of forestry, Bray organized the Agricultural Division at Syracuse University. He remained at Syracuse until 1943 as chair of botany and Dean of the Syracuse Graduate School.

In 1915, the same year that Dr. Bray published &quot;The Development of the Vegetation of New York State&quot;, he became one of the founding members, along with Raphael Zon and Yale School of Forestry&#x27;s second dean, James W. Toumey, of the Ecological Society of America. In 1950, the 1917 &quot;activist wing&quot; of that Society formed today&#x27;s The Nature Conservancy.

Most of the professors in the early years of the College of Forestry at Syracuse and the Department of Forestry at Cornell&#x27;s New York State College of Agriculture were educated in forestry at the Yale School of Forestry. The forestry students at Syracuse but not at Cornell were referred to as &quot;stumpies&quot; by their classmates.

Fifty-two students were enrolled in the school&#x27;s first year, the first 11 graduating two years later, in 1913. Research at the college commenced in 1912, with a study of New York state firms using lumber, including from which tree species and in what quantities.

=== Expansion ===
In 1912, the college opened its Ranger School in Wanakena, New York, in the Adirondacks. The college began enrolling women as early as 1915, but the first women to complete their degrees—one majoring in landscape engineering and two in pulp and paper—graduated in the late 1940s. The Ranger School itself did not enroll any women until 1973–74.

In January 1930, Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt, recommending an allocation of $600,000 towards construction of the college&#x27;s second building, in honor of Louis Marshall, recently deceased, noted that: &quot;under [Marshall&#x27;s] leadership and the leadership of its late dean, Franklin Moon, the School of Forestry made giant strides until it became recognized as the premier institution of its kind in the United States&quot;. The cornerstone of Louis Marshall Memorial Hall was laid in 1931 by former Governor and presidential candidate Alfred E. Smith who was elected to assume the presidency of the college&#x27;s board of trustees.

=== Affiliation with SUNY ===
With the formation of the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1948, the college became recognized as a specialized college within the SUNY system, and its name was changed to State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. In 1972, the college&#x27;s name was changed yet again to State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Unlike other state-supported degree-granting institutions which had been created at private institutions in New York State, the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University was an autonomous institution not administratively part of Syracuse University. In 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF&#x27;s &quot;primacy&quot; among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies.

==Campuses==

=== Syracuse ===


ESF&#x27;s main campus, in Syracuse, New York, is where most academic, administrative, and student activity takes place. The campus is made up of nine main buildings:

* Baker Laboratory: Named after Hugh P. Baker, dean of the college from 1912 to 1920 and again 1930–33. The building is the location of several computer clusters and auditorium-style classrooms. It is home to the Department of Environmental Resources Engineering and the Division of Environmental Science. The building underwent a $37 million overhaul in the early 2000s, providing updated space for the Tropical Timber Information Center and the Nelson C. Brown Center for Ultrastructure Studies. Baker Lab is the site of ESF&#x27;s NASA-affiliated Research Center. Baker Laboratory houses two multimedia lecture halls, a &quot;smart&quot; classroom outfitted for computer use and distance learning, and two construction management and planning studios. It also has a full-scale laboratory for materials science testing, including a modern dry kiln, a wood identification laboratory, shop facilities (including portable sawmill) and wood preservation laboratory.
* Bray Hall: The building is the oldest on campus, completed in 1917, the largest building devoted to Forestry at the time. It is named after William L. Bray, a founder of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University and its first dean, 1911–1912. It is the location of most administrative offices and the Department of Sustainable Resources Management. The State University Police department is in the basement.
* Gateway Center: The campus&#x27; newest building, opened in March 2013, &quot;sets a new standard for LEED buildings, producing more renewable energy than it consumes,&quot; according to Cornelius B. Murphy, Jr. The building is &quot;designed to achieve LEED Platinum Certification&quot;. The ESF College Bookstore, Trailhead Cafe, and Office of Admissions are in the Gateway Center.
* Illick Hall: The building was completed in 1968, and is home to the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology. It is named after Joseph S. Illick, a dean of the State University College of Forestry at Syracuse University. There is a large lecture hall (Illick 5) on the ground floor. Several greenhouses are on the fifth floor. The Roosevelt Wildlife Museum is also in the building.
* Jahn Laboratory: Named after Edwin C. Jahn, former head of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The building was completed in 1997. Home to the Department of Chemistry.
* Marshall Hall: Named after Louis Marshall, one of the founders of the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University. The Alumni (Nifkin) Lounge and Marshall Auditorium are within. Twin brass plaques commemorate the contributions of Marshall and his son, alumnus Bob Marshall. Home of the Department of Environmental Studies, the Department of Landscape Architecture, and the Division of General Education.
* Moon Library: Dedicated to F. Franklin Moon, an early dean of the college. Completed in 1968, along with Illick Hall. A computer cluster and student lounge are in the basement.
* Walters Hall: Named after J. Henry Walters, who served on the college&#x27;s board of trustees. Completed in 1969. Home to the Department of Chemical Engineering. The pilot plant in the building includes two paper machines and wood-to-ethanol processing equipment.
*Centennial Hall: ESF&#x27;s on-campus student dormitory, commemorating the college&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The facility is capable of accommodating 280-300 freshman (in double or triple studio rooms with private bath), 116 upperclassmen (in single bedroom suits with private bath), and an additional 56 upperclassmen (in 4-bedroom, 2-bath apartments). A $31 million project, Centennial Hall opened in 2011.

Bray Hall, Marshall Hall, Illick Hall, and Moon Library border the quad. Other buildings on the Syracuse campus include one for maintenance and operations, a garage, and a greenhouse converted to office space. Among planned new buildings is a research support facility.

The historic Robin Hood Oak (photo below) is behind Bray Hall. The tree is said to have grown from an acorn brought back by a faculty member from the Sherwood Forest in England. It was the first tree listed on the National Registrar of Historic Trees in the United States.

=== Wanakena ===

Students in the forest and natural resources management curriculum may spend an academic year (48 credits) or summer at the Ranger School, in Wanakena, New York, earning an Associate of Applied Science (A.A.S.) degree in forest technology, surveying, or environmental and natural resources conservation. The campus, established in 1912, is on the east branch of the Oswegatchie River that flows into Cranberry Lake, in the northwestern part of the Adirondack Park. It includes the James F. Dubuar Memorial Forest, named after a former director of the Ranger School.

=== Field stations and forests ===

* The Arturo and Maria Sundt Field Station, ESF&#x27;s first international field station, is used for research and teaching. A former farm, it is near the town of Coyolito, in the province of Guanacaste, Costa Rica, approximately from the Gulf of Nicoya on the country&#x27;s west coast. 
==Academics==
The ESF mission statement is &quot;to advance knowledge and skills and to promote the leadership necessary for the stewardship of both the natural and designed environments.&quot; ESF is a &quot;specialized institution&quot; of the State University of New York, meaning that curricula focus primarily on one field, the college&#x27;s being environmental management and stewardship. Students may supplement their education with courses taken at Syracuse University. ESF has academic departments in the fields of chemistry; environmental and forest biology; environmental resources engineering; environmental studies; sustainable resources management; landscape architecture; and chemical engineering. Environmental science programs offer students integrative degrees across the natural sciences.

The admission rate for applicants to ESF is 83 percent (Fall 2023). ESF is ranked at 74th in the 2025 &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings of the top public national universities. Furthermore, ESF is tied at 144th in the 2025 &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot; list of the best National Universities (both public and private). &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked ESF as 64th best graduate school in Environmental/ Environmental Health Engineering category in 2016. The &quot;Washington Monthly College Guide&quot; ranked ESF No. 49 among the nation&#x27;s top service-oriented colleges and universities for 2012 (and sixth in &quot;community service participation and hours served&quot;).
&quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; ranked ESF #54 in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Best College Buys&quot; for 2012. Forbes.com has also ranked ESF at No. 3 on its 2010 list of the 20 best colleges for women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). ESF is listed at No. 2, ahead of top programs like Duke, Cornell and Yale, among the best college environmental programs in the nation by Treehugger.com, a website devoted to sustainability and environmental news. In 2007, &quot;DesignIntelligence&quot; magazine ranked ESF&#x27;s undergraduate and graduate programs in &quot;Landscape Architecture&quot;, respectively at No. 12 and No. 9 in the United States.

The &quot;Online College Database&quot; ranked ESF at No. 6 on its list of &quot;50 Colleges Committed to Saving the Planet&quot; for 2013. The ranking relates in part to one of the school&#x27;s newest programs, Sustainable Energy Management. Launched in 2013, the program focuses on energy markets, management, and resources. Global issues such as responsible energy use and development of sustainable energy sources are critical focal points in the STEM major.

==Research==

ESF is classified as a &quot;Carnegie R2 Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity&quot; institution. The first research report published in 1913 by the College of Forestry was the result of the above noted USDA Forest Service supported study of the wood-using industries of New York State. Since that time, the research initiatives of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) have expanded greatly as faculty and students conduct pioneering studies, many with a global reach. ESF researchers delve into topics well beyond the boundaries of central New York. Recent international sites of research interest include Madagascar, the Amazon floodplains, Mongolia and the Galapagos Islands. Vermont and the Sierra Nevada are other locales within the US where recent research has focused. Current research efforts include the Willow Biomass Project and the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project which produced the Darling 58 chestnut tree.

==Campus life==
Many students identify themselves as a &quot;Stumpy&quot; (or &quot;Stumpie&quot;). The nickname was given to students by their neighbors at Syracuse University, probably in the 1920s, and most-likely refers to forestry &quot;stump jumpers&quot;. Although originally used as an insult, today, most students embrace the nickname with pride.

Students at the Syracuse campus enjoy many activities on and off campus. There are a number of student clubs and organizations at ESF, including the Mighty Oaks Student Assembly (formerly United Students Association), Graduate Student Association, the Guy A. Baldassare Birding Club, the Student Environmental Education Coalition, the Woodsmen Team, Bob Marshall Club, Alpha Xi Sigma Honor Society, Soccer Team, Sigma Lambda Alpha, &quot;The Knothole&quot; (weekly newspaper), Papyrus Club, &quot;The Empire Forester&quot; (yearbook), Landscape Architecture Club (formally the Mollet Club), Forest Engineers Club, Environmental Studies Student Organization, Habitat for Humanity, &quot;Ecologue&quot; (yearly journal), the Bioethics Society, Green Campus Initiative, Baobab Society, and the Sustainable Energy Club. Wanakena students have their own woodsmen and ice hockey teams. A number of professional organizations are also open to student membership, including the Society of American Foresters, The Wildlife Society, Conservation Biology club, American Fisheries Association, and the (defunct) American Water Resources Association.

ESF has an agreement with adjacent Syracuse University that allows ESF students to enjoy many amenities offered by SU. ESF students take courses at their sister institution, can apply for admission to concurrent degree and joint certificate programs, and may join any SU organization except for NCAA sports teams. SU students are also welcome to enroll in ESF classes. Because of this, students feel a certain degree of integration with the Syracuse University community. Every May, ESF holds a joint commencement ceremony with Syracuse University in the Carrier Dome. ESF&#x27;s baccalaureate diplomas bear the seals of the State University of New York and Syracuse University.

Students also enjoy a variety of shops, restaurants, museums, and theaters in Syracuse, and nearby Marshall Street and Westcott Street.

== Gateway Center ==
ESF has launched several programs, within the confines of campus and other locations, to reduce its carbon emissions. The Gateway Center utilizes sustainable energy resources to generate power and heat utilized across the campus. The building includes a state-of-the-art, combined heat-and-power (CHP) system, producing 65% of campus heating needs along with 20% of its electrical needs. The CHP system uses biomass to drive a steam turbine and produce electricity, while natural gas is used for steam heating along with additional electricity. It has been estimated this building alone is responsible for reducing ESF&#x27;s carbon footprint by 22%.
Increased global awareness of global warming and reduced nonrenewable resources has driven ESF to invest in biomass. Biomass is a renewable resource that draws light energy, carbon dioxide, and water from the environment; in return oxygen is released. It can be harvested without negatively affecting the environment. For this reason, ESF launched a program to grow its own biomass, known as the &quot;Willow Biomass Project&quot;. Benefits of woody willow include, high yields and fast growth times, quick re-sprouting, and high heat energy is produced when burned. Woody willow also increases habitat diversity significantly contributes to carbon neutrality.

The Gateway Center was one of the final stages in the school&#x27;s &quot;Climate Action Plan&quot;, that encompasses the vision of carbon neutrality and reduced fossil fuel dependence by 2015. Currently, the school rests in Phase III of the program and is on track to reach its goal. Included in Phase III is the opening of The Gateway Center, retrofits to Illick Hall, and rooftop greenhouse replacement. One other advancement towards carbon neutrality can be seen on top of the campus&#x27;s buildings. Rooftop gardens provide reduced energy consumption and water runoff. Shrubbery, soil thickness, and moisture content all can contribute to increased energy savings. Gateway and other buildings on campus utilize rooftop gardens to reduce energy consumption and water runoff.

== Athletics ==
The SUNY ESF athletic teams are called the Mighty Oaks. The college is a member the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA), primarily competing in the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (HVIAC) since about the 2004–05 academic year.

ESF competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include cross country, soccer and track &amp; field; and co-ed sports include bass fishing and timber sports.

=== Cross country ===
The school&#x27;s men&#x27;s cross-country team are eight-time USCAA national champions (2011-2014; 2021-2024). The women&#x27;s cross-country team are five-time USCAA national champions (2018; 2021-2024). In 2024, ESF became the only USCAA school to win 4 consecutive titles for both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competition in the same sport. 

=== Soccer ===
The men&#x27;s soccer team was invited to the 2012 USCAA National Championship Tournament in Asheville, North Carolina, making it to the semifinals.

=== Timber sports ===
ESF has a long tradition of competing in intercollegiate woodsman competitions in the northeastern US and eastern Canada. The team came in first in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s divisions of the northeastern US and Canadian 2012 spring meet. Students at the SUNY-ESF Ranger School, in Wanakena, compete as the Blue Ox Woodsmen team.

=== Club sports ===
In addition to the intercollegiate USCAA and woodsman teams, ESF students participate on club sports teams at both ESF and Syracuse University, including ESF&#x27;s competitive bass fishing team, and SU&#x27;s quidditch team. Students at the Ranger School participate in the Ranger School Hockey Club.

=== Athletics history ===
In one notable part of the college&#x27;s history, Laurie D. Cox, professor of Landscape Architecture, was responsible for establishing Syracuse University&#x27;s renowned lacrosse program in 1916, including players from the New York State College of Forestry.

==Affiliation with Syracuse University==
ESF was founded in 1911 as the New York State College of Forestry at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee Louis Marshall, with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed several years after the cessation of state funding to the earlier New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.

ESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from Syracuse University, while some resources, facilities and infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students may take courses at both institutions, and baccalaureate diplomas from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with that of the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools. ESF receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college&#x27;s educational facilities. The state has somewhat similar financial and working relationships with five statutory colleges that are at Alfred University and Cornell University, although unlike ESF, these statutory institutions are legally and technically part of their respective host institutions and are administered by them as well.

ESF faculty, students, and students&#x27; families join those from Syracuse University (SU) in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August and combined commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to library resources, recreational facilities, student clubs, and activities at both institutions, except for the schools&#x27; intercollegiate athletics teams, affiliated with the USCAA and NCAA, respectively.

==Traditions==
The best known tradition among ESF students is that walking across the quad is shunned. The tradition, which dates back to at least the early 1960s, is intended to inhibit tracks from being worn into the lawn. Hecklers have been known to yell and even tackle people walking across the quad. However, other activities such as frisbee and soccer are encouraged on the Quad.

Eustace B. Nifkin, ESF&#x27;s previous mascot, is an unofficial student. He first appeared in the 1940s after a group of students summering in the Adirondacks thought him up. Ever since, he has appeared on class rosters, written articles for &quot;The Knothole&quot;, and sent mail to the college from around the world. He has a girlfriend, the lesser-known Elsa S. Freeborn. SUNY granted him a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1972. The Alumni Lounge in Marshall Hall is dedicated to Nifkin.

Another well known legend is that of Chainer or Chainsaw who supposedly graduated in 1993.

* Spring Banquet
* December Soiree
* Friends and Family BBQ
* Coffee Haus
* Festival of Places

<text>Raphael Sobiehrd-Mnishovsky of Sebuzin and of Horstein (; 1580 in Horšovský Týn – 21 November 1644 in Prague) was a Bohemian lawyer and writer. He held various secretarial, diplomatic, and judicial posts under Rudolf II, Mathias, Ferdinand II, and Ferdinand III, under whom Raphael was the attorney-general.

Mnishovsky was also a poet and cryptographer, and is associated with the mystery of the Voynich manuscript. According to a 1666 letter which was stored with the manuscript, Raphael had told the letter&#x27;s writer, Marcus Marci, that the manuscript had originally belonged to Rudolf, who had purchased it for 600 gold ducats.

<doc id="523202" wikidata="Q1564959" url="?curid=523202" title="Rootless cosmopolitan">
<text>Rootless cosmopolitan () was a pejorative Soviet epithet which referred mostly to Jewish intellectuals as an accusation of their lack of allegiance to the Soviet Union, especially during the antisemitic campaign of 1948–1953. This campaign had its roots in Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 1946 attack on writers who were connected with &quot;bourgeois Western influences&quot;, culminating in the &quot;exposure&quot; of the non-existent Doctors&#x27; Plot in 1953.

The term is considered to be an antisemitic trope.

== Origin ==
The expression was coined in the 19th century by Russian literary critic Vissarion Belinsky to describe writers who lacked Russian national character.

== Use under Stalin ==

According to the journalist Masha Gessen, a concise definition of rootless cosmopolitan appeared in an issue of &quot;Voprosy istorii&quot; (&quot;The Issues of History&quot;) in 1949: &quot;The rootless cosmopolitan [...] falsifies and misrepresents the worldwide historical role of the Russian people in the construction of socialist society and the victory over the enemies of humanity, over German fascism in the Great Patriotic War.&quot; Gessen states that the term used for &quot;Russian&quot; is an exclusive term that means ethnic Russians only and so they conclude that &quot;any historian who neglected to sing the praises of the heroic ethnic Russians [...] was a likely traitor&quot;. According to Cathy S. Gelbin:
From 1946 onwards, then, when Andrei Zhdanov became director of Soviet cultural policy, Soviet rhetoric increasingly highlighted the goal of a pure Soviet culture freed from Western degeneration. This became apparent, for example, in a piece in the Soviet weekly &quot;Literaturnaya Gazeta&quot; in 1947, which denounced the claimed expressions of rootless cosmopolitanism as inimical to Soviet culture. From 1949 onwards, then, a new series of openly antisemitic purges and executions began across the Soviet Union and its satellite countries, when Jews were charged explicitly with harbouring an international Zionist cosmopolitanist conspiracy.

According to Margarita Levantovskaya:
The campaign against cosmopolitanism of the 1940s and 1950s [...] defined rootless cosmopolitans as citizens who lacked patriotism and disseminated foreign influence within the USSR, including theater critics, Yiddish-speaking poets and doctors. They were accused of disseminating Western European philosophies of aesthetics, pro-American attitudes, Zionism, or inappropriate levels of concern for Jewry and its destruction during World War II. The phrase &quot;rootless cosmopolitan&quot; was synonymous with &quot;persons without identity&quot; and &quot;passportless wanderers&quot; when applied to Jews, thus emphasizing their status as strangers and outsiders.

<text>Product churning is the business practice whereby more of the product is sold than is beneficial to the consumer. An example is a stockbroker who buys and sells securities in a portfolio more frequently than is necessary, in order to generate commission fees.

Dollar cost averaging is a form of product churn under certain conditions. In this strategy, an investor is advised to repeatedly buy or sell small lots of a security as the price changes. Each transaction carries a commission fee. In this way the overall cost is averaged down as prices fall, and the investor is protected from market fluctuations which can be very difficult to accurately predict. The effectiveness of this as an investing strategy is open to debate, but it involves many transactions, creating brokerage commissions for the brokerage firm. Frequent trading in fee-based accounts is not an example of churning, since no commissions are generated in those transactions. However, the practice of putting clients who trade infrequently into a fee-based brokerage account is known as &quot;reverse churning&quot;, since clients are charged fees in accounts with few if any transactions.

Another form of product churning is sometimes practiced by maintenance service providers. By replacing worn-out parts with inferior quality parts, they are assured of a greater frequency of service requests.

Companies sometimes intentionally deliver products which are not durable or reliable, so that the customer will have to replace them, in what is known as planned obsolescence. Similarly, new models might be made incompatible with accessories used with old models to force consumers to purchase replacements.

Another example is refreshments and snacks sold in theaters, fairs, and other venues. Small servings are proportionally more expensive than large servings. Customers choose the bigger size even if it is more than they would like to eat or drink because it seems like a better deal.

Textbook publishers are often accused of product churning for their practice of frequently publishing new editions of their texts (thus rendering previous editions obsolete, forcing students to purchase the new editions as required texts and minimizing or eliminating the prices paid for the old editions by bookstore buyback programs), often while making insignificant changes to the information presented in the text.

Product churning is similar to the razor and blades business model. This involves selling a basic product at a loss (or low profit margin), but receiving very high profit margins on associated products that are necessary for the basic product&#x27;s continued usage. Examples of this strategy include razors (and their blades), computer printers (and their ink cartridge refills), cell phones (and their usage time), and cameras (and film).

<text>Auckland Island () is the main island of the eponymous uninhabited archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. It is part of the New Zealand subantarctic area. It is inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage list together with the other New Zealand Subantarctic Islands in the region.

== Geography ==

The island has a land area of about , and is long. It was formed 25 to 10 million years ago from a huge volcanic pile which formed two domes – one centred around Carnley Harbour in the south and another (the Ross Dome) around Disappointment Island to the west. The island is made of volcanic scoria, blanketed in over 2m of peat. It is notable for its steep cliffs and rugged terrain, which rises to over . Prominent peaks include Cavern Peak, at ; Mount Raynal, at ; Mount D&#x27;Urville, at ; Mount Easton, at ; and the Tower of Babel, at .

The southern end of the island broadens to a width of , encompassing Carnley Harbour. At the western side a very narrow channel known as Victoria Passage separates the main island from the smaller Adams Island. Adams Island and the southern part of the main island form the crater rim; north of Carnley Harbour&#x27;s mouth lies Cape Lovitt, the westernmost point of New Zealand.

== Flora ==

There are distinct vegetation zones. There is a band of Southern rātā &quot;Metrosideros umbellata&quot; around the coast apart from on the western side, the height of which is determined by the shelter, aspect and degree of the slope. The rātā forest may extend into the &quot;Chionochloa&quot; tussock grasslands but in most places merges into a thick band of low, tight scrub dominated by &quot;Dracophyllum longifolium&quot;, &quot;Ozothamnus vauvilliersii&quot; and &quot;Myrsine divaricata.&quot; This scrub band is almost impenetrable and in places is dense enough to walk on top of.

An expedition report from 1907 describes the scrub thusly: 
The scrub band breaks into patches and transitions into extensive grassland of &quot;Chionochloa antarctica&quot; which in turn merges into a sparsely vegetated fellfield community on the most exposed alpine areas. The megaherbs &quot;Anisotome antipoda&quot;, &quot;Anisotome latifolia&quot;, &quot;Bulbinella rossii&quot;, &quot;Pleurophyllum criniferum&quot;, &quot;Pleurophyllum hookeri&quot;, &quot;Pleurophyllum speciosum&quot; and &quot;Stilbocarpa polaris&quot; were historically found from the coast into the alpine, however the distribution and populations of these species have been severely impacted by the actions of introduced pigs.

== Marine mammals ==
Port Ross at the north end of Auckland Island is the only breeding site for the New Zealand population of southern right whales. Up to 400 may be found in the harbour during the winter months, and are regularly surveyed by the University of Otago.

A breeding population of New Zealand sea lions is found on the island. 80% of the total population live and breed in the archipelago. The New Zealand Department of Conservation has conducted an annual survey of the population on the islands since 1994.

== Bird life ==
The island is part of the Auckland Island group Important Bird Area (IBA), identified as such by BirdLife International because of the significance of the group as a breeding site for several species of seabirds.

The Gibson&#x27;s albatross &quot;Diomedea antipodensis gibsoni,&quot; Auckland shag &quot;Leucocarbo colensoi,&quot; Auckland teal &quot;Anas aucklandica&quot;, Auckland rail &quot;Lewinia muelleri&quot; and Auckland snipe &quot;Coenocorypha aucklandica&quot; are all endemic to the Auckland Island group. Of these only shags are currently breeding on main Auckland Island, in areas where introduced cats and pigs cannot access their nests.

The Auckland Island merganser &quot;Mergus australis&quot; went extinct in 1902. The population is thought to have been 20–30 breeding pairs prior to predation by introduced pigs and cats. The last specimen was collected as a museum specimen in January 1902.

== Introduced species ==
There are currently introduced pigs, cats and mice on Auckland Island. Auckland Island is the only island within the New Zealand Subantarctic Island Area with invasive mammalian pests. A project proposed by the Department of Conservation aims to remove these pests from the island, with feasibility trials started in 2018.

DNA analysis suggests that mice—&quot;Mus musculus&quot;—did not colonise Auckland Island from a New Zealand population but instead arrived with whalers or sealers from North America. They eat invertebrates, seeds, other plant material, native fish eggs and can eat bird eggs and chicks. They severely deplete invertebrate populations, reduce the seedbank, eat seedlings &amp; plants and compete with birds for food resources.

Domestic cats—&quot;Felis catus&quot;—were first recorded at Terror Cove in 1840, presumably introduced by sealers, but most likely arrived in the two decades prior to this. The impact of cats on the birds of Auckland Island was first noted by the Coastwatchers, who tamed some for company – the Ranui Station cats were recorded to kill 60 Antarctic prions over three months in 1942. Ornithologist Brian Bell found that prions were confined to cliff faces at Crozier Point in 1962 and noted &quot;any bird landing...[fell] an immediate prey to the feral cats.&quot;. Gut content and scat analysis show that cats are feeding on small passerines and seabirds. A cat was seen feeding on a pre-fledging juvenile white-capped mollymawk at South West Cape.

Goats were introduced to the Auckland Islands several times in the second half of the nineteenth century, to serve as a source of food for castaway sailors, with at least one liberation in 1865 on the main Auckland Island. By the 1970s, only one population remained, a group of about 100 based on the northwest side of Port Ross, in the north-east of the main island. Browsing by goats caused significant damage to lowland tussock &quot;Chinochloa antarctica&quot; in particular. In 1986 and 1987, over 60 animals were removed from the island for captive breeding in New Zealand. A decision was made to eradicate the remaining animals, an operation which was completed by 1992. An investigation in 1999 into the fate of the translocated animals in New Zealand found that the breed had become extinct.

Pigs—&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;—were first introduced at Port Ross in the north of Auckland Island in 1807 by Captain Abraham Bristow and several further liberations occurred in the 19th century. The pigs were intended as a food source for shipwreck survivors and sealers. Auckland Island pigs are a feral race of domestic pigs which are considered a distinct breed by the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand. Pigs have had a severe impact on populations of megaherbs, with populations of these plants on Auckland Island being almost totally depleted by the early 1900s.

Dunnocks, common redpolls, Eurasian blackbirds, song thrushes and common starlings which were introduced onto mainland New Zealand have naturally established on Auckland Island.

&quot;Oleria lyalli&quot; is a tree asterad native to New Zealand which may have arrived with humans in the 19th century. It is spreading from a historic settlement site at Erebus Cove and covers neighbouring Ewing Island. Harakeke &quot;Phormium tenax&quot; is found at Erebus Cove, Sealer&#x27;s Creek, Ranui Cove and Tandy Inlet, and was introduced probably by the second wave of sealers to visit the island, to make rope, twine, baskets, mats etc. Kormiko, &quot;Veronica salicifolia&quot;, was first reported in 1975 around the Lindley Point farmhouse site at Deas Head, built in 1851.

In February 2025, the Department of Conservation (DOC) announced a pest eradication project on the island. The project, part of the Island-Ocean Connection Challenge (IOCC), targets three islands up to 15 times larger than any previously cleared of pests in New Zealand. The goal is to remove invasive species, restore ecosystems, and protect native wildlife, including kākāpō, seabirds, and rare plants. The total project cost is estimated at $202 million, with $54 million from the government and $11.5 million raised through philanthropy, leaving $137 million still needed.

== Human presence on the island ==

There is archaeological evidence that the Auckland Islands were briefly settled and abandoned by Polynesians around 600–700 years ago. Māori and Moriori from the Chatham Islands settled at Ranui Cove from 1842 till 1856. Auckland Island was the site of the failed settlement of Hardwicke, which was founded in 1849 but survived only three years before being disbanded in 1852.

Both the and the were wrecked on Auckland Island in 1864, and groups of survivors lived unaware of each other on opposite ends of the island. The &quot;Grafton&quot; survivors lived for 18 months on the island before building a boat and sailing to New Zealand; the &quot;Invercauld&quot; survivors camped in the remains of Hardwicke; and all but three died before being rescued.

The German transit of Venus expedition of 1874 made observations from Terror Cove in Port Ross.

Coastwatchers from the Cape Expedition were stationed on the island from March 1941 to October 1945. Two stations were constructed: One at Ranui Cove in outer Port Ross and another at Tagua, on Musgrave Peninsula in Carnley Harbour. A base at Waterfall Inlet was the mooring point for the &quot;Ranui&quot; which serviced the stations.

<doc id="523211" wikidata="Q1393140" url="?curid=523211" title="Fairey Albacore">
<text>The Fairey Albacore is a single-engine biplane torpedo bomber designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Fairey Aviation. It was primarily operated by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm (FAA) during the Second World War.

The Albacore, popularly known as the &quot;Applecore&quot;, was conceived as a replacement for the Fairey Swordfish, an earlier biplane introduced during the mid 1930s. It was typically operated by a crew of three and was designed for spotting and reconnaissance as well as level, dive, and torpedo bombing. First flown on 12 December 1938, the Albacore was in production between 1939 and 1943, and entered FAA service with 826 Naval Air Squadron during March 1940. The type was initially operated from land bases, being dispatched on attack missions against enemy shipping and harbours in the vicinity of the English Channel. The first operations on board an aircraft carrier commenced in November 1940.

At its height, 15 first-line FAA squadrons flew the Albacore. The type was much used in the Mediterranean, participating in the Battle of Cape Matapan, the Second Battle of El Alamein, as well as the landings at Sicily and Salerno. Despite the intention to replace the Swordfish, the Albacore served with it and was eventually retired before it, both aircraft having been replaced by a pair of monoplane designs, the Fairey Barracuda and Grumman Avenger. In addition to the FAA, the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) operated the type.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the Albacore can be traced back to the issuing of Specification S.41/36 by the Air Ministry on 11 February 1937, as well as the earlier Specification M.7/36. The latter had sought a three-seat TSR (torpedo/spotter/reconnaissance) aircraft with which to replace the Fairey Swordfish in Fleet Air Arm (FAA) service. It was required to be capable of speeds between 58 and 183 knots while also carrying a single 18-inch Mark XIIA torpedo; furthermore, it was to be fitted with dual flight controls, have a powered rear turret, comprehensive facilities for observation and navigation, and incorporate soundproofing and heating measures.

In response, Fairey Aviation decided to work on its own design. Early activities included the wind tunnel testing of various biplane models at RAE Farnborough between November 1936 and June 1937. These tests reportedly influenced designs regarding the fitting of flaps upon the wings. The company produced both biplane and monoplane configurations to fulfil the requirement, officials dismissed the monoplane proposal as it raised uncertainties for the role it was to be tasked with at that time. Accordingly, Fairey focused its efforts onto the biplane configuration.

The Albacore, otherwise designated &quot;TBR&quot; (torpedo/bomber/reconnaissance), was a single-bay all-metal biplane. Its fuselage was of a semi-monocoque design and was equipped with a split undercarriage. In comparison to the Swordfish, the Albacore was furnished with a more powerful engine that drove a Constant-speed propeller, while the fuselage was also more aerodynamically refined. The engine that powered the early Albacores was a single Bristol Taurus II radial engine, capable of 1,065 hp, while those built later on received the more powerful Taurus XII, capable of 1,130 hp, instead.

Furthermore, the Albacore provided numerous amenities for the benefit of its crew, such as its fully enclosed cockpit, a central heating system, a windscreen wiper for the pilot, and lavatory. In the event of a water landing, the aircraft was also fitted with an automatic liferaft deployment system to assist in the crew&#x27;s survival. The armament of the Albacore typically included a single fixed forward-firing machine gun in the upper starboard wing, while the rear cockpit was provided with either a single or twin Vickers K machine gun. It could carry a maximum under-wing bomb load of four bombs.

The wings of the Albacore were of an equal span and were foldable for more compact stowage onboard aircraft carriers. These wings, which were covered by fabric, featured relatively large flaps that were hydraulically-actuated and could also act as air brakes during dives. Akin to the preceding Swordfish, it was capable of dive bombing; it was capable of diving at speeds of up to 215 knots (400 km/h) IAS irrespective of the positioning of the flaps. According to the wartime pilot Eric Brown, the Albacore was relatively steady throughout the dive, while the recovery was typically both smooth and relatively easy to perform.

===Into flight===
On 12 December 1938, the first of two prototypes performed its maiden flight from the Great West Aerodrome, flown by F. H. Dixon. During April 1939, the second prototype made its first flight, joining its sibling in the flight test programme shortly thereafter. Both prototypes had not been ordered under individual contracts, but had instead been the first two of a production batch of 100 aircraft. There were some differences from subsequent production aircraft, such as their initial outfitting with non-tapered engine cowlings and wheel-spats.

While the Albacore had been developed as a carrier-capable land plane, there was interest in its potential as a floatplane, thus the first prototype was later outfitted with floats and was experimentally configured for catapult-assisted takeoffs. The Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment (MAEE) tested it in early 1940, during which its water-handling was less than favourable, although it retained acceptable airborne characteristics, save for its reportedly poorly-harmonised flight controls.

During 1939, quantity production of the first batch of 98 aircraft commenced; the start of production had been delayed on account of production slippages of the Taurus engine. During February 1940, testing of the Albacore and Taurus II engine alike commenced at RAF Boscombe Down. During these tests, the prototype demonstrated its ability to attain a maximum speed of , at an altitude of 4,800 ft (1,463 m), at 11,570 lb (5,259 kg), which was achieved while carrying four depth charges underneath its wings, while its maximum speed without the depth charges was . An Albacore fitted with the Taurus II engine and carrying a torpedo weighed 11,100 lb (5,045 kg).

Some minor criticisms of the Albacore were produced during its 1940 evaluation flights; issues included the excessive heat of the forward cockpit during the summer months, while the rear cockpit was cold and subject to persistent drafts. The stall characteristics were described as uncomfortable, while the crew boarding process was also seen as somewhat hazardous. However, the only notable change in the specification was the replacement of the Taurus II engine with the improved Taurus XII counterpart.

A total of 800 Albacores were built, including the two prototypes, which were all manufactured at Fairey&#x27;s Hayes factory. Production came to an end in 1943. They were typically test flown from London&#x27;s Great West Aerodrome, what has since been expanded into London Heathrow Airport.

==Operational history==
During March 1940, No. 826 Naval Air Squadron was specially formed to operate the first Albacores; within weeks, the type had begun operations, attacking harbours and shipping in the English Channel, operating from shore bases, as well as providing convoy escort for the rest of 1940. ″s 826 and 829 Squadrons were the first to operate the Albacore from an aircraft carrier, operations commencing in November 1940. The Albacore suffered from reliability problems with the Taurus engine, although these were later solved, so that the failure rate was no worse than the Pegasus equipped Swordfish. The Albacore remained less popular than the Swordfish, as it was less manoeuvrable, while the controls were considered to be too heavy for a pilot to perform much evasive action after dropping a torpedo.

Eventually, there were 15 first-line FAA squadrons equipped with the Albacore which operated widely in the Mediterranean. In March 1941, Albacores made torpedo attacks during the Battle of Cape Matapan, inflicting severe damage on the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto despite the presence of heavy anti-aircraft fire. The type also played a prominent role in the ill-fated raid on Kirkenes and Petsamo during July 1941. Albacores also participated, with greater success, in the fighting at El Alamein, dropping flares to mark targets for RAF night bombers.

Between September 1941 and June 1943, No. 828 Squadron, based at RAF Hal Far, Malta, operated a squadron of Albacores under severe blitz conditions during the Siege of Malta. The type employed a mixture of mines and bombs to attack Italian shipping, including convoys, along with shore targets in Sicily, mainland Italy, and North Africa. Albacores also supported the landings at Sicily and Salerno, guarding against enemy submarines and raiding key enemy facilities such as airfields and forts.
On 9 March 1942, twelve Albacores from attacked the German battleship at sea near Narvik. Based on information from one of a search force of six Albacores that had been launched earlier, Albacores from 817 and 832 Squadrons launched torpedoes. One attack came within of &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, but the attack failed for the loss of two aircraft.

During 1943, the Albacore was replaced in FAA service by the newer Barracuda. The final Albacore squadron of the FAA, No. 841 Squadron, which had flown numerous shore-based attacks against shipping in the English Channel for the whole of its career with the Albacore, was disbanded in late 1943.

The Royal Air Force deployed some Albacores; 36 Squadron based at Singapore acquired five to supplement its Vickers Vildebeests at RAF Seletar in December 1941. The remnants of the squadron was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. During 1943, No. 415 Squadron RCAF was equipped with Albacores (presumably ex-FAA) before the Flight operating them was transferred and reformed as 119 Squadron at RAF Manston in July 1944. The squadron deployed later to Belgium and their Albacores were disposed of in early 1945, due to spares shortages, in favour of the inferior but ASV radar-equipped Swordfish Mk.IIIs that the squadron kept until the end of the war on 8 May. This was to combat German mini-submarines attacking Allied shipping entering the River Scheldt on its way to the Port of Antwerp. The Aden Communication Flight used 17 Albacores between the middle of 1944 and August 1946. Some of these were delivered by sea on the in December 1945 (all from Royal Navy stock).

The Royal Canadian Air Force took over the Albacores and used them during the Normandy invasion, for a similar role until July 1944. The Albacore was the last biplane to be used in combat by the RCAF.

<doc id="523215" wikidata="Q368993" url="?curid=523215" title="Jacobus Sinapius">
<text>Jacobus Sinapius or Jacobus Horcicky (modern ; 1575 – 25 September 1622), later granted the title &quot;de [[Tepenec Castle|Tepenec]]&quot; (&quot;of Tepenec&quot;; Czech: &quot;z Tepence&quot;), was a Bohemian pharmacist and personal doctor of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. His latinized name &quot;Sinapius&quot; is a translation of his family name &quot;Hořčický&quot;, which means &quot;mustard&quot; in Czech.

==Biography==
According to his college records, Sinapius was born in Bořenovice in Moravia in a lower-class family. He initially worked as kitchen helper at the Jesuit school at Krumlov, but was eventually admitted to the of poor students in 1590. Sinapius eventually graduated from the Krumlov Gymnasium, where he studied poetry and rhetoric, and became a pharmacist himself. There he also worked in the college&#x27;s pharmacy, on topics involving chemistry and herbalism, under the overseeing of Martin Schaffner (1564–1608).

By 1598, he started studying Aristotelian philosophy at the Clementinum college in Prague (which was later merged with Charles University), and at the same time oversaw the kitchen and pantry, but continued working in chemistry and pharmacy. However, Sinapius was not satisfied with the teachings there, musing over Barbara Celarent, instead of studying physics and the origins of nature. Because his herbal skills to treat illness impressed, he was allowed gardening near the river Vltava, under the Bräke. Here he grew herbs and set up a laboratory at Smíchov (then a village behind Prague walls), the Clementinum&#x27;s botanical garden. There, or at the garden, he distilled a very popular &quot;aqua sinapis&quot; (German: &quot;sinapischen Wasser&quot;, both &quot;mustard water&quot;, perhaps in reference to his own name) whose sale made him a wealthy man.

In 1600, he became the administrator of the Jesuit college in Jindřichův Hradec, and in 1606 he became &quot;capitaneus&quot; and administrator of the properties of the St. George&#x27;s Convent in the Prague Castle. In 1607 he was named imperial chemist by Rudolf II. In return for curing the emperor of a grave disease, he was ennobled with the title &quot;de Tepenec&quot;, presumably after the medieval Tepenec Castle (destroyed in 1391) near Olomouc. He lent emperor Rudolf II money and received from him in return an estate around town Mělník. He also supported students of the studies of Catholic theology financially.

In the religious disputes of the early 17th century, Sinapius strongly defended the Catholic side. He became the administrator of the but was jailed in 1620, when the Protestants took charge of the town. Subsequently, was exchanged for another prisoner (the famous physician Jessenius) and exiled, but later, after the failure of the Bohemian Revolt, he returned to Mělník and lived there the rest of his life.

He died in 1622, from a horse-fall that he had suffered a year before. Two days before his death he was moved to the Clementinum in the care of the Jesuits, and left them the sum of 50,000 gold coins and his Mělník estate. He is buried in the Church of St. Salvator in the Clementinum.

==Writings==
In 1609 Sinapius published a pro-Catholic pamphlet which saw several reprintings. According to a 1777 source, he had written several manuscripts on chemistry and botany.

==Connection to the Voynich manuscript==
Book dealer Wilfrid Voynich saw Sinapius&#x27;s name and title at the bottom of the first page of the Voynich manuscript. Voynich saw the faint writing and subsequently used chemicals to make it clearer but failed. It was later revealed by ultraviolet light to be Sinapius&#x27;s signature and has been compared with other samples. Sinapius is thus the second person known to have owned the Voynich manuscript after Emperor Rudolf II. Its attested provenance begins with him, since the story that it was owned by Emperor Rudolf II rests on a single piece of unsubstantiated hearsay, related second hand in a letter to Athanasius Kircher.

<doc id="523217" wikidata="Q725364" url="?curid=523217" title="Atacama Large Millimeter Array">
<text>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an astronomical interferometer of 66 radio telescopes in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, which observe electromagnetic radiation at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The array has been constructed on the elevation Chajnantor plateau – near the Llano de Chajnantor Observatory and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. This location was chosen for its high elevation and low humidity, factors which are crucial to reduce noise and decrease signal attenuation due to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. ALMA provides insight on star birth during the early Stelliferous era and detailed imaging of local star and planet formation.

ALMA is an international partnership amongst Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Chile. Costing about US$1.4 billion, it is the most expensive ground-based telescope in operation. ALMA began scientific observations in the second half of 2011 and the first images were released to the press on 3 October 2011. The array has been fully operational since March 2013.

==Overview==

The initial ALMA array is composed of 66 high-precision antennae, and operates at wavelengths of 3.6 to 0.32 millimeters (31 to 1000 GHz). The array has much higher sensitivity and higher resolution than earlier submillimeter telescopes such as the single-dish James Clerk Maxwell Telescope or existing interferometer networks such as the Submillimeter Array or the &quot;Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimétrique&quot; (IRAM) Plateau de Bure facility.

The antennae can be moved across the desert plateau over distances from 150 m to 16 km, which will give ALMA a powerful variable &quot;zoom&quot;, similar in its concept to that employed at the centimeter-wavelength Very Large Array (VLA) site in New Mexico, United States.

The high sensitivity is mainly achieved through the large numbers of antenna dishes that make up the array.

The telescopes were provided by the European, North American and East Asian partners of ALMA. The American and European partners each provided twenty-five 12-meter diameter antennae, for a subtotal of fifty antennae, that compose the main array. The participating East Asian countries are contributing 16 antennae (four 12-meter diameter and twelve 7-meter diameter antennae) in the form of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), which is part of the enhanced ALMA.

By using smaller antennae than the main ALMA array, larger fields of view can be imaged at a given frequency using ACA. Placing the antennae closer together enables the imaging of sources of larger angular extent. The ACA works together with the main array in order to enhance the latter&#x27;s wide-field imaging capability.

===History===
ALMA has its conceptual roots in three astronomical projects: the Millimeter Array (MMA) of the United States, the Large Southern Array (LSA) of Europe, and the Large Millimeter Array (LMA) of Japan.

The first step toward the creation of what would become ALMA came in 1997, when the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) agreed to pursue a common project that merged the MMA and LSA. The merged array combined the sensitivity of the LSA with the frequency coverage and superior site of the MMA. ESO and NRAO worked together in technical, science, and management groups to define and organise a joint project between the two observatories with participation by Canada and Spain (the latter became a member of ESO later).

A series of resolutions and agreements led to the choice of &quot;Atacama Large Millimeter Array&quot;, or ALMA, as the name of the new array in March 1999 and the signing of the ALMA Agreement on 25 February 2003, between the North American and European parties. (&quot;Alma&quot; means &quot;soul&quot; in Spanish and &quot;learned&quot; or &quot;knowledgeable&quot; in Arabic.) Following mutual discussions over several years, the ALMA Project received a proposal from the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) whereby Japan would provide the ACA (Atacama Compact Array) and three additional receiver bands for the large array, to form Enhanced ALMA. Further discussions between ALMA and NAOJ led to the signing of a high-level agreement on 14 September 2004 that makes Japan an official participant in Enhanced ALMA, to be known as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 6, 2003 and the ALMA logo was unveiled.

During an early stage of the planning of ALMA, it was decided to employ ALMA antennae designed and constructed by known companies in North America, Europe, and Japan, rather than using one single design. This was mainly for political reasons. Although very different approaches have been chosen by the providers, each of the antenna designs appears to be able to meet ALMA&#x27;s stringent requirements. The components designed and manufactured across Europe were transported by specialist aerospace and astrospace logistics company Route To Space Alliance, 26 in total which were delivered to Antwerp for onward shipment to Chile.

==Funding==
ALMA was initially a 50-50 collaboration between the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and European Southern Observatory (ESO) and later extended with the help of the other Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chilean partners. ALMA is the largest and most expensive ground-based astronomical project, costing between US$1.4 and 1.5 billion. (However, various space astronomy projects including the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and several major planet probes have cost considerably more).

;Partners
* European Southern Observatory and the European Regional Support Centre
* National Science Foundation via the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the North American ALMA Science Center
* National Research Council of Canada
* National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ) under the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS)
* ALMA-Taiwan at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (ASIAA)
* Republic of Chile

==Construction==
The complex was built primarily by European, U.S., Japanese, and Canadian companies and universities. Three prototype antennae have undergone evaluation at the Very Large Array since 2002.

General Dynamics C4 Systems and its SATCOM Technologies division was contracted by Associated Universities, Inc. to provide twenty-five of the 12 m antennae, while European manufacturer Thales Alenia Space provided the other twenty-five principal antennae (in the largest-ever European industrial contract in ground-based astronomy). Japan&#x27;s Mitsubishi Electric was contracted to assemble NAOJ&#x27;s 16 antennae. The antennae were delivered to the site from December 2008 to September 2013.

===Transporting the antennae===
Transporting the 115 tonne antennae from the Operations Support Facility at 2900 m altitude to the site at 5000 m, 
or moving antennae around the site to change the array size, presents enormous challenges; as portrayed in the television documentary &quot;Monster Moves: Mountain Mission&quot;. The solution chosen is to use two custom 28-wheel self-loading heavy haulers. The vehicles were made by in Germany and are 10 m wide, 20 m long and 6 m high, weighing 130 tonnes. They are powered by twin turbocharged 500 kW Diesel engines.

The transporters, which feature a driver&#x27;s seat designed to accommodate an oxygen tank to aid breathing the thin high-altitude air, place the antennae precisely on the pads. The first vehicle was completed and tested in July 2007. Both transporters were delivered to the ALMA Operations Support Facility (OSF) in Chile on 15 February 2008.

On 7 July 2008, an ALMA transporter moved an antenna for the first time, from inside the antenna assembly building (Site Erection Facility) to a pad outside the building for testing (holographic surface measurements).

During Autumn 2009, the first three antennae were transported one-by-one to the Array Operations Site. At the end of 2009, a team of ALMA astronomers and engineers successfully linked three antennae at the elevation observing site thus finishing the first stage of assembly and integration of the fledgling array. Linking three antennae allows corrections of errors that can arise when only two antennae are used, thus paving the way for precise, high-resolution imaging. With this key step, commissioning of the instrument began 22 January 2010.

On 28 July 2011, the first European antenna for ALMA arrived at the Chajnantor plateau, 5,000 meters above sea level, to join 15 antennae already in place from the other international partners. This was the number of antennae specified for ALMA to begin its first science observations, and was therefore an important milestone for the project. In October 2012, 43 of the 66 antennae had been set up.

==Scientific results==

===Images from initial testing===

By the summer of 2011, sufficient telescopes were operational during the extensive program of testing prior to the Early Science phase for the first images to be captured. These early images gave a first glimpse of the potential of the new array that will produce much better quality images in the future as the scale of the array continues to increase.

The target of the observation was a pair of colliding galaxies with dramatically distorted shapes, known as the Antennae Galaxies. Although ALMA did not observe the entire galaxy merger, the result is the best submillimeter-wavelength image ever made of the Antennae Galaxies, showing the clouds of dense cold gas from which new stars form, which cannot be seen using visible light.

===Comet studies===
On 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of HCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON).

===Planetary formation===
An image of the protoplanetary disc surrounding HL Tauri (a very young T Tauri star in the constellation Taurus) was made public in 2014, showing a series of concentric bright rings separated by gaps, indicating protoplanet formation. , most theories did not expect planetary formation in such a young (100,000-1,000,000-year-old) system, so the new data spurred renewed theories of protoplanetary development. One theory suggests that the faster accretion rate might be due to the complex magnetic field of the protoplanetary disc.

=== Event Horizon Telescope ===

ALMA participated in the Event Horizon Telescope project, which produced the first direct image of a black hole, published in 2019.

===Phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus===
ALMA participated in the claimed detection of phosphine, a biomarker, in the air of Venus. As no known non-biological source of phosphine on Venus could produce phosphine in the concentrations detected, this would have indicated the presence of biological organisms in the atmosphere of Venus. Later reanalyses cast doubt on the detection, although later analyses confirmed the results. The detection remains controversial, and is awaiting additional measurements.

==Global collaboration==

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy facility, is a partnership of Europe, North America and East Asia in cooperation with the Republic of Chile. ALMA is funded in Europe by the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in North America by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) in cooperation with the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) and the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC) and in East Asia by the National Institutes of Natural Sciences of Japan (NINS) in cooperation with the Academia Sinica (AS) in Taiwan. ALMA construction and operations are led on behalf of Europe by ESO, on behalf of North America by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), which is managed by Associated Universities, Inc (AUI) and on behalf of East Asia by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) provides the unified leadership and management of the construction, commissioning and operation of ALMA. Its current director since February 2018 is Sean Dougherty.

==ALMA regional centre (ARC)==
The ALMA regional centre (ARC) has been designed as an interface between user communities of the major contributors of the ALMA project and the JAO. Activates for operating the ARC have also divided into the three main regions involved (Europe, North America and East Asia). The European ARC (led by ESO) has been further subdivided into ARC-nodes located across Europe in Bonn-Bochum-Cologne, Bologna, Ondřejov, Onsala, IRAM (Grenoble), Leiden and JBCA (Manchester).

The core purpose of the ARC is to assist the user community with the preparation of observing proposals, ensure observing programs meet their scientific goals efficiently, run a help-desk for submitting proposals and observing programs, delivering the data to principal investigators, maintenance of the ALMA data archive, assistance with the calibration of data and providing user feedback.

==Project detail==
* At least 50 antennae of 12 m diameter located at an elevation of 5,000 m at Llano de Chajnantor Observatory, enhanced by a compact array of 4 x 12 m and 12 x 7 m antennae (in 2006, consortium considered whether to build 50 or 64 of the 12 m ones. After a Tough Year, ALMA&#x27;s Star Begins to Rise at Last High and dry)
* Imaging instrument in all atmospheric windows between 350 μm and 10 mm
* Array configurations from approximately 150 m to 14 km
* Spatial resolution of 10 milliarcseconds (10−7 radians), 10 times better than the Very Large Array (VLA) and 5 times better than the Hubble Space Telescope, but still considerably lower than the resolution achieved with optical and infrared interferometers.
* The ability to image sources arcminutes to degrees across at one arcsecond resolution
* Velocity resolution under 50 m/s
* Faster and more flexible imaging instrument than the Very Large Array
* Largest and most sensitive instrument in the world at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths
* Point source detection sensitivity 20 times better than the Very Large Array
* Data reduction system will be CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) which is a new software package based on AIPS++

===Atacama Compact Array===

The Atacama Compact Array, ACA, is a subset of 16 closely separated antennae that will greatly improve ALMA&#x27;s ability to study celestial objects with a large angular size, such as molecular clouds and nearby galaxies. The antennae forming the Atacama Compact Array, four 12-meter antennae and twelve 7-meter antennae, were produced and delivered by Japan. In 2013, the Atacama Compact Array was named the Morita Array after Professor Koh-ichiro Morita, a member of the Japanese ALMA team and designer of the ACA, who died on 7 May 2012 in Santiago.

==Work stoppage==
In August 2013, workers at the telescope went on strike to demand better pay and working conditions. This is one of the first strikes to affect an astronomical observatory. The work stoppage began after the observatory failed to reach an agreement with the workers&#x27; union. After 17 days an agreement was reached providing for reduced schedules and higher pay for work done at high altitude.

In March 2020, ALMA was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also delayed the cycle 8 proposal submission deadline and suspended public visits to the site.

On October 29, 2022, ALMA suspended observations due to a cyber attack. Observations were restarted 48 days later, on December 16, 2022.

<text>Blue Ball is a community in Butler and Warren counties, in the U.S. state of Ohio. The community was established in 1820 at the intersection of the Dixie Highway (later U.S. Route 25). Blue Ball was annexed by nearby Middletown in 1994.

Blue Ball was so named because that image appeared on its tavern&#x27;s signboard for the benefit of the illiterate.

<text>Jan Marek Marci (; June 13, 1595April 10, 1667), or Johannes Marcus Marci, was a Bohemian doctor and scientist, rector of the University of Prague, and official physician to the Holy Roman Emperors. The crater Marci on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

== Career ==
Marci was born in Lanškroun, near the border between historical lands Bohemia and Moravia (presently parts of the Czech Republic). He studied under Athanasius Kircher, and spent most of his career as a professor of Charles University in Prague, where he served for over thirty years as a professor of medicine, eight times as Dean of the medical school and once as Rector in 1662. He was also the personal doctor of Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I, and distinguished himself in the defense of Prague against the Swedish armies in 1648. In October 1654 he was given the nobility title (&quot;falckrabě&quot;) &quot;de Kronland&quot; (anagram of &quot;Landskron&quot;, German name for the city of Lanškroun). It is contested whether Marci was a member of the Royal Society. Some claim that he was elected as a corresponding member in 1667. Other dispute this and argue that a Fellowship was not granted due to his death in this year. Unlike in the legend spread by Jesuit order, he did not join the Jesuit order shortly before his death.

== Work ==
Marci&#x27;s studies covered the mechanics of colliding bodies, epilepsy, and the refraction of light, as well as other topics. Prior to Marci, the prevailing theory of color assumed that light was modified by the action of a medium to produce color. Most theories were based upon the assumption that color was simply a modification of light varying between whiteness and blackness. Marci preceded Isaac Newton in his belief that &quot;Light is not changed into colors except by a certain refraction in a dense medium; and the diverse species of colors are the products of refraction.&quot; Although he thought that different colors were caused by varying angles of incidence across the 1/2 degree apparent diameter of the sun, he stated that each color was condensed or disentangled from the others after refraction into homogeneous or elementary colors of red, green, blue and purple, and that no further change in color was obtained by additional refraction of elementary colors.

Marci at some time came into possession of the Voynich Manuscript, apparently upon the death of its former owner, the alchemist Georg Baresch. He sent the book to his longtime friend Athanasius Kircher, with a cover letter dated 19 August 1666, or possibly 1665. This cover letter has remained intact and was present when the manuscript was obtained by Wilfrid Voynich.

He is remembered today by the award of an an

<text>Southeastern Louisiana University (Southeastern) is a public university in Hammond, Louisiana. It was founded in 1925 by Linus A. Sims as Hammond Junior College. Sims succeeded in getting the campus moved to north Hammond in 1928, when it became known as Southeastern Louisiana College. It achieved university status in 1970.

In the fall of 2019 there were 14,298 students enrolled. During the 1990s, Southeastern was one of the fastest-growing colleges in the United States. The university is the third largest in Louisiana, trailing only LSU and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

Southeastern&#x27;s colors are green and gold, and the mascot is a lion named Roomie. Southeastern&#x27;s sports teams participate in NCAA Division I (FCS for football) in the Southland Conference.

==History==

Hammond Junior College was created in 1925. It was managed by the Tangipahoa Parish School Board and initially offered only a teaching certificate. The college moved to the Hunter Leake estate in north Hammond in 1927 to accommodate more students. The following year, its name changed to Southeastern Louisiana College and it joined the state&#x27;s educational system under the state&#x27;s board of education. The campus grew in the late 1920s and 1930s with the purchase of and the construction of McGehee Hall and a gymnasium.

Lucius McGehee Hall was built in 1935. it is the oldest building constructed by the university. McGehee Hall is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The college&#x27;s curricular offerings increased significantly in 1937 when the college received approval to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The first ones were awarded two years later.

Although Act 388 in 1938, an amendment to the 1920 Louisiana Constitution, granted the college the same legal status as other four-year colleges in the state, it did not provide for increased funding for the college.

In 1946 the college received initial accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Subsequent enrollment growth following the end of World War II required additional expansion and construction. This included the use of two steel barracks donated to the college; these were used as dormitories and named McNeely Hall (which was demolished in 2007).

The college&#x27;s curricular offerings grew again in 1960 when the college established the Division of Graduate Studies. The college awarded its first graduate degree in 1967, the Education Specialist degree. The college completed the War Memorial Student Union in the mid-1960s; it claims to be &quot;the only student union building in the United States dedicated to alumni who died in World War II.&quot; In 1970, the institution officially became Southeastern Louisiana University.

After years of planning and fundraising, the Southeastern Louisiana University Center was constructed. An 8000-seat (more if the floor level is used) arena, the University Center hosts all home basketball games and a variety of civic, cultural, and big-name entertainment events.

Fanfare, a festival celebrating the arts, humanities, and sciences, was begun in October 1986 by university faculty. It has grown into a month-long event.

In 1996 SLU joined the University of Louisiana System.

The university began to implement screened admissions standards in the fall of 2000. The following year, Southeastern took ownership of the historic Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in downtown Hammond. The theater is operated by a separate foundation and presents a variety of theatrical works, concerts, and dance performances.

Southeastern Louisiana University played an important role in supporting students in the state and region in 2005. The university was not damaged by Hurricane Katrina so it was able to host nearly two thousand students from areas that were effected. A fountain was dedicated in 2007 to the victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita; it is the only such memorial fountain in existence.

In 2012, the university, along with Northwestern State University and Louisiana State University, was censured by the American Association of University Professors for violations of AAUP standards on faculty rights. 


Southeastern offers has its University Center for commencement exercises of high schools throughout the Northshore Region and actively encouraging area high school students to continue on to the university level.

Southeastern owns the Columbia Theatre for the Performing Arts in Hammond&#x27;s Historic District. First opened in 1928, the Columbia was acquired by the university in the 1990s and renovated in the amount of $5.6 million. The large foyer is dedicated to the late State Senator John Hainkel, who was instrumental in obtaining the funding for the renovation.

==Academics==

Southeastern Louisiana University is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award degrees at the Associate, Baccalaureate and Master&#x27;s levels. Southeastern has been accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools since 1946.

Southeastern consists of five colleges with 18 academic departments and programs offering over 60 degree programs.

Southeastern&#x27;s state-of-the-art Sims Library houses several important collections, including the Morrison Room, the Rayburn Collection, the Pineywoods People Exhibits, and the Center for Regional Studies. The Bill Evans archives are housed at the library. 

The campus is also home for the state&#x27;s sole commemoration of the governorship (1936–1939) of Richard W. Leche (1898–1965). It is a large medallion on the north exterior wall of the east side of Strawberry Stadium.

Southeastern offers nursing curricula in Hammond and Baton Rouge. In a consortium with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Southeastern offers a master of science in nursing.

Southeastern became a doctoral-granting institution in 2005 with the inauguration of a doctor of education in higher education leadership.

Southeastern&#x27;s business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The Southeastern Business School is located in Garret Hall. Southeastern was the first institution in Louisiana to achieve AACSB&#x27;s separate and special accreditation in accounting Graduates of both the MBA program and the Executive MBA program are serving widely in education and industry.

In the aftermath of Tulane University&#x27;s post-Katrina decision to close several engineering programs including computer engineering, Southeastern received approval from the Louisiana Board of Regents to develop an undergraduate curriculum in engineering technology within the Department of Computer Science &amp; Industrial Technology.

Southeastern has several state-of-the-art athletic facilities, including an eight-lane all-weather running track completed in 2011 (see inset).

== Media ==
Southeastern&#x27;s major campus media and publications are the &quot;Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot; (newspaper), KSLU (FM radio station), &quot;ByLion&quot; (weekly online publication), the Southeastern Channel (public access cable television channel), and &quot;Le Souvenir&quot; (official yearbook).

&quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot; is the official newspaper of the students of Southeastern Louisiana University and has been in continuous publication since 1937. &quot;ByLion&quot; newsletter is published weekly online for faculty and staff. &quot;Le Souvenir&quot; is the student yearbook, published annually by students. &quot;Le Souvenir&quot; (French for &quot;the memory&quot;) has been in continuous publication since 1929.

Southeastern&#x27;s KSLU-FM radio station began operation on November 11, 1974, as a radio club at the university. In 1988, KSLU became the first radio station in the South to install a digital touchscreen operating system. The installation was featured in &quot;Broadcast Engineering&quot; magazine. In 1993, an emergency-situation room was added using amateur radio equipment purchased with grants from State Farm Insurance and Louisiana Power &amp; Light (a subsidiary of Entergy). During critical times, this room is staffed by local ham operators, members of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service in the Florida Parishes area. In 1996 KSLU began broadcasting globally via the internet. A job at KSLU was the start of the media career of Robin Roberts.

The Southeastern Channel officially began July 9, 2002. It won four Telly Awards in 2007. Staff member Steve Zaffuto won two Bronze Tellys for animation of &quot;Native Sounds&quot; and &quot;Current Events&quot; promotions, and Josh Kapusinski won a first-place Silver Telly for animation and a Bronze Telly for editing the &quot;Florida Parish Chronicles&quot; promo. Josh Kapusinski&#x27;s &quot;Florida Parish Chronicles&quot; promo won a 2006 Emmy Award in the Suncoast Region.

<doc id="523235" wikidata="Q745253" url="?curid=523235" title="Erigeron">
<text>Erigeron () is a large genus of plants in the composite family (Asteraceae). It is placed in the tribe Astereae and is closely related to the Old World asters (&quot;Aster&quot;) and the true daisies (&quot;Bellis&quot;). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the highest diversity occurs in North America.

==Etymology==
Its English name, fleabane, is shared with related plants in several other genera. It appears to be derived from a belief that the dried plants repelled fleas or that the plants were poisonous to fleas. The generic name &quot;Erigeron&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek words (&quot;êri&quot;) &quot;early in the morning&quot; and (&quot;gérōn&quot;) &quot;old man&quot;, a reference to the appearance of the white hairs of the fruit soon after flowering or possibly alluding to the early appearance of the seed heads. The noun is masculine, so that specific epithets should have masculine endings (e.g. &quot;glaucus&quot;) to agree with it. However, authors have incorrectly used neuter endings (e.g. &quot;glaucum&quot;), because the ending &quot;-on&quot; resembles the ending of Ancient Greek neuter second declension nouns, as Augustin Pyramus de Candolle did in his 1836 account of the genus.

==Description==
The species may be annuals, biennials, or perennials. They are well-branched with erect stems, characterized by their numerous white, lavender, or pink ray flowers and yellow disc flowers. Some members of this group have no ray flowers. The pappus (=modified calyx, forming a crown) is shorter than in &quot;Aster&quot; and consists of bristles. The ray florets are narrower than in &quot;Aster&quot; but are longer than the involucre (=whorled bracts).

==Cultivation==
Many species are used as ornamental plants, with numerous named cultivars such as &#x27;Wayne Roderick&#x27;, &#x27;Charity&#x27;, &#x27;Foersters Liebling&#x27;, and &#x27;Dunkelste aller&#x27; (&quot;The darkest of all&quot; with semi-double, deep-violet flower heads).

==Ecology==
&quot;Erigeron&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Bucculatrix angustata&quot;, &quot;Coleophora squamosella&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;E. acris&quot;), &quot;Schinia intermontana&quot;, &quot;Schinia obscurata&quot; (both of which also feed exclusively on &quot;Erigeron&quot;), &quot;Schinia sexata&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;E. glabellus&quot;) and &quot;Schinia villosa&quot;. Above-ground biomass of &quot;Erigeron&quot; in montane meadows decreases with decreased water availability/increased temperatures.

==Selected species==

 Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online lists around 460 species of plants in the genus &quot;Erigeron&quot;. Selected species include:

The following names are not accepted in Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online database:

*&quot;Erigeron acer&quot; – blue fleabane
*&quot;Erigeron corymbosus&quot; – long-leaf fleabane
*&quot;Erigeron greenei&quot;
*&quot;Erigeron hultenii&quot; – Hulten&#x27;s fleabane

<doc id="523236" wikidata="Q1068496" url="?curid=523236" title="God of the gaps">
<text>&quot;God of the gaps&quot; is a theological concept that emerged in the 19th century and revolves around the idea that gaps in scientific understanding are regarded as indications of the existence of God. This perspective has its origins in the observation that some individuals, often with religious inclinations, point to areas where science falls short in explaining natural phenomena as opportunities to insert the presence of a divine creator. The term itself was coined in response to this tendency. This theological view suggests that God fills in the gaps left by scientific knowledge, and that these gaps represent moments of divine intervention or influence.

This concept has been met with criticism and debate from various quarters. Detractors argue that this perspective is problematic as it seems to rely on gaps in human understanding and ignorance to make its case for the existence of God. As scientific knowledge continues to advance, these gaps tend to shrink, potentially weakening the argument for God&#x27;s existence. Critics contend that such an approach can undermine religious beliefs by suggesting that God only operates in the unexplained areas of our understanding, leaving little room for divine involvement in a comprehensive and coherent worldview.

The &quot;God of the gaps&quot; perspective has been criticized for its association with logical fallacies. The &quot;God of the gaps&quot; perspective is also a form of confirmation bias, since it involves interpreting ambiguous evidence (or rather no evidence) as supporting one&#x27;s existing attitudes. This type of reasoning is seen as inherently flawed and does not provide a robust foundation for religious faith. In this context, some theologians and scientists have proposed that a more satisfactory approach is to view evidence of God&#x27;s actions within the natural processes themselves, rather than relying on the gaps in scientific understanding to validate religious beliefs.

==Origins of the term==
From the 1880s, Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, Part Two, &quot;On Priests&quot;, said that &quot;into every gap they put their delusion, their stopgap, which they called God&quot;. The concept, although not the exact wording, goes back to Henry Drummond, a 19th-century evangelist lecturer, from his 1893 Lowell Lectures on &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;. He chastises those Christians who point to the things that Science has not explained as presence of God — &quot;gaps which they will fill up with God&quot; — and urges them to embrace all nature as God&#x27;s, as the work of &quot;an immanent God, which is the God of Evolution, is infinitely grander than the occasional wonder-worker, who is the God of an old theology.&quot;

In 1933, Ernest Barnes, the Bishop of Birmingham, used the phrase in a discussion of general relativity&#x27;s implication of a Big Bang:

During World War II, the German theologian and martyr Dietrich Bonhoeffer expressed the concept in similar terms in letters he wrote while in a Nazi prison. Bonhoeffer wrote, for example:

In his 1955 book &quot;Science and Christian Belief&quot; Charles Alfred Coulson (1910−1974) wrote:
and
Coulson was a mathematics professor at Oxford University as well as a Methodist church leader, often appearing in the religious programs of British Broadcasting Corporation. His book got national attention, was reissued as a paperback, and was reprinted several times, most recently in 1971.
It is claimed that the actual phrase &#x27;God of the gaps&#x27; was invented by Coulson.

The term was then used in a 1971 book and a 1978 article, by Richard Bube. He articulated the concept in greater detail in &quot;Man come of Age: Bonhoeffer’s Response to the God-of-the-Gaps&quot; (1978). Bube attributed modern crises in religious faith in part to the inexorable shrinking of the God-of-the-gaps as scientific knowledge progressed. As humans progressively increased their understanding of nature, the previous &quot;realm&quot; of God seemed to many persons and religions to be getting smaller and smaller by comparison. Bube maintained that Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; was the &quot;death knell&quot; of the God-of-the-gaps. Bube also maintained that the God-of-the-gaps was not the same as the God of the Bible (that is, he was not making an argument against God per se, but rather asserting there was a fundamental problem with the perception of God as existing in the gaps of present-day knowledge).

==General usage==
The term &quot;God of the gaps&quot; is sometimes used in describing the incremental retreat of religious explanations of physical phenomena in the face of increasingly comprehensive scientific explanations for those phenomena. Dorothy Dinnerstein includes psychological explanations for developmental distortions leading to a person believing in a deity, particularly a male deity.

R. Laird Harris writes of the physical science aspect of this:
The expression, &quot;God of the Gaps,&quot; contains a real truth. It is erroneous if it is taken to mean that God is not immanent in natural law but is only to be observed in mysteries unexplained by law. No significant Christian group has believed this view. It is true, however, if it be taken to emphasize that God is not only immanent in natural law but also is active in the numerous phenomena associated with the supernatural and the spiritual. There are gaps in a physical-chemical explanation of this world, and there always will be. Because science has learned many marvelous secrets of nature, it cannot be concluded that it can explain all phenomena. Meaning, soul, spirits, and life are subjects incapable of physical-chemical explanation or formation.

==Usage in referring to a type of argument==

The term &quot;God-of-the-gaps fallacy&quot; can refer to a position that assumes an act of God as the explanation for an unknown phenomenon, which according to the users of the term, is a variant of an argument from ignorance fallacy. Such an argument is sometimes reduced to the following form:
*There is a gap in understanding of some aspect of the natural world.
*Therefore, the cause must be supernatural.
One example of such an argument, which uses God as an explanation of one of the current gaps in biological science, is as follows:
&quot;Because current science can&#x27;t figure out exactly how life started, it must be God who caused life to start.&quot; Critics of intelligent design creationism, for example, have accused proponents of using this basic type of argument.

God-of-the-gaps arguments have been discouraged by some theologians who assert that such arguments tend to relegate God to the leftovers of science: as scientific knowledge increases, the dominion of God decreases.

==Criticism==
The term was invented as a criticism of people who perceive that God only acts in the gaps, and who restrict God&#x27;s activity to such &quot;gaps&quot;. It has also been argued that the God-of-the-gaps view is predicated on the assumption that any event which can be explained by science automatically excludes God; that if God did not do something via direct action, that he had no role in it at all.

The &quot;God of the gaps&quot; argument, as traditionally advanced by scholarly Christians, was intended as a criticism against weak or tenuous faith, not as a statement against theism or belief in God.

According to John Habgood in &quot;The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology&quot;, the phrase is generally derogatory, and is inherently a direct criticism of a tendency to postulate acts of God to explain phenomena for which science has not (at least at present) given a satisfactory account. Habgood also states:

It is theologically more satisfactory to look for evidence of God&#x27;s actions within natural processes rather than apart from them, in much the same way that the meaning of a book transcends, but is not independent of, the paper and ink of which it is comprised.

It has been criticized by both theologians and scientists, who say that it is a logical fallacy to base belief in God on gaps in scientific knowledge. In this vein, Richard Dawkins, an atheist, dedicates a chapter of his book &quot;The God Delusion&quot; to criticism of the God-of-the-gaps argument. He noted that:

<doc id="523245" wikidata="Q1290002" url="?curid=523245" title="Hawaii State Capitol">
<text>The Hawaii State Capitol is the official statehouse or capitol building of the U.S. state of Hawaii. From its chambers, the executive and legislative branches perform the duties involved in governing the state. The Hawaii State Legislature—composed of the twenty-five member Hawaii State Senate led by the President of the Senate and the fifty-one member Hawaii State House of Representatives led by the Speaker of the House—convenes in the building. Its principal tenants are the governor and lieutenant governor of Hawaii, as well as all legislative offices and the Legislative Reference Bureau.

Located in downtown Honolulu, the Hawaii State Capitol was commissioned and dedicated by John A. Burns, second governor of Hawaii. It opened on March 15, 1969, replacing the former statehouse, the Iolani Palace.

==Monuments==
Burns designed the restoration of the royal palace built by King David Kalākaua and Queen Kapiolani; as part of that effort, the Queen Liliuokalani Statue in the Capitol Mall between the capitol building and Iolani Palace was dedicated on April 10, 1982. The site was once &quot;Haimoeipo&quot;, the royal residence of Queen Dowager Kalama and later King Lunalilo, who died there.

Several other capitol building monuments decorate the statehouse grounds. The Beretania Street entrance features the Liberty Bell, a gift of the President of the United States and the United States Congress to the Territory of Hawaii in 1950 as a symbol of freedom and democracy. One of the more prominent monuments on the statehouse grounds is the Father Damien Statue—a tribute to the Roman Catholic priest who died in 1869 after sixteen years of serving patients afflicted with leprosy. Father Damien was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 1995, and canonized on October 11, 2009, by Pope Benedict XVI. His feast Day is celebrated on May 10. In Hawaiʻi, it is celebrated on the day of his death, April 15.

The Eternal Flame on Beretania Street is a metal sculptured torch that burns endlessly as a tribute to all men and women from Hawaii who served with the Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines, and Navy in the major and minor conflicts in which the United States was engaged. Likewise, the Korean-Vietnam War Memorial pays tribute to service members who died in those conflicts. Dedicated on July 24, 1994, by Benjamin J. Cayetano, fifth Governor of Hawaii, the monument consists of 768 black marble pedestals engraved with the names of 312 service members of the Vietnam War. A larger marble slab bears a Hawaiian language inscription of remembrance.

==Architecture==
The Hawaii State Capitol is an American adaptation of the Bauhaus style termed &quot;Hawaiian international architecture&quot;. It was designed by a partnership between the firms of Belt, Lemon and Lo (Architects Hawaii Ltd.), and John Carl Warnecke and Associates. Unlike other state capitols modeled after the United States Capitol, the Hawaii State Capitol&#x27;s distinct architectural features symbolize various natural aspects of Hawaii. Among them:

* The building is surrounded by a reflecting pool, symbolizing the Pacific Ocean.
* The two legislative chambers are cone-shaped, symbolizing volcanoes that formed the Hawaiian Islands.
* The columns around the perimeter of the building have shapes resembling royal palm trees. There are eight columns in four rows at either side of the building, representing the eight main islands of Hawaii; sets of eight items appear in other places inside and along the outside of the building.
* The Capitol is built with an open-air design, allowing sun, wind, and rain to enter; the central atrium opens to the sky and rainbows can sometimes be seen inside the building when it rains.
* Four kukui nut trees (Hawaii&#x27;s state tree) are a numerical reference to the four main counties in the State of Hawaii and the four major Hawaiian gods (Kukailimoku, Kane, Lono, and Kanaloa). Sets of four items appear in many other places in the building.
* When standing in the center of the structure, the chandeliers from both legislative chambers, which represent the sun and moon, can be seen through the glass walls, while the area that is normally reserved for a rotunda in most capitol buildings is left open to the sky. It is said that the sky is Hawaii&#x27;s capitol dome. 
* German-American artist Otto Piene designed the chandeliers, which are kinetic sculptures made of small objects. The Sun chandelier in the House is made of dozens of gold-plated globes, and the Moon chandelier in the Senate is made of 620 white chambered nautilus shells.

===Reflecting pool algae issue===
From the time the Capitol was completed in 1969, the reflecting pool has had a persistent algae growth problem, due partly to the fact the pool is fed with brackish water from on-site wells. Attempts by the state to fix the problem included introducing tilapia fish into the pool and installing an ozone treatment system. The state currently has the pool lining scrubbed manually with enzymes added to the water to combat growth. Some Capitol regulars say the algae growth has come to represent the pollution of the Pacific Ocean, in an ironic twist of the original symbolic meaning of the pool.

<doc id="523249" wikidata="Q2044298" url="?curid=523249" title="List of dukedoms in the peerages of Britain and Ireland">
<text>This article lists all dukedoms, extant, extinct, dormant, abeyant, or forfeit, in the peerages of England, Scotland, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

==Introduction of dukedoms into England==

Edward III of England created the first three dukedoms of England (Cornwall, Lancaster, and Clarence). His eldest son Edward, the Black Prince, was created Duke of Cornwall, the first English Duke, in 1337. Two weeks after the Prince&#x27;s death the dukedom was recreated for his 9-year-old son Richard of Bordeaux, who would eventually succeed his grandfather as Richard II. The Dukes of Cornwall are not numbered as part of their style.

The second dukedom was originally given to Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, but upon his death was re-created for the 3rd son of Edward III, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. On that same day Edward III also created a dukedom for his second son, Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence. When Richard II reached majority, he created dukedoms for his last two uncles on the same day: Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester.

Originally, dukedoms were created for those who had royal blood, either by descent or marriage (see below, list of surnames). By the end of the Middle Ages, traditionally marked by the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485, a total of 31 dukedoms (with 16 distinct titles) had been created; yet only those of Cornwall, Lancaster and Suffolk remained. The Duchy of Cornwall was permanently associated with the heir apparent, and the Duchy of Lancaster became Crown property.

The first Duke of Norfolk had died in the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Three decades later the Dukedom of Norfolk was restored to his son by Henry VIII. Thus when Elizabeth I came to power the only living duke was Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Elizabeth did not create any dukes, and she beheaded Thomas Howard at the age of 36 for plotting to wed Mary, Queen of Scots and overthrow her. By 1572, this class of peerage was extinct, and there were no dukes in the last 30 years of her reign. The extant dukedoms in the Peerage of England were all created (or restored, in the cases of Norfolk and Somerset) in the Stuart period, beginning with James I&#x27;s re-creation of the dukedom of Buckingham in 1623 for George Villiers.

With the possible exception of the Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster (which come with great territories attached), all ducal titles in England have been created and held by royal patent or charter, and not by tenure. As a result, the rules of succession to a ducal title are usually explicitly laid out in the patent, and are not necessarily consistent, nor do they coincide with common inheritance laws on property. For instance, an heir does not usually inherit the ducal title by virtue of being the heir of the last holder, but by virtue of descent from the first person to whom the title was given, so a full-blood daughter of a duke may be superseded by a half-blood male relative who can prove direct descent from the first holder.

<doc id="523250" wikidata="Q1922148" url="?curid=523250" title="Character structure">
<text>A character structure is a system of secondary traits manifested in the specific ways that an individual relates and reacts to others, to various kinds of stimuli, and to the environment. A child whose nurture and/or education cause them to have conflict between legitimate feelings, living in an illogical environment and interacting with adults who do not take the long-term interests of the child to heart will be more likely to form these secondary traits. In this manner the child blocks the unwanted emotional reaction that would have normally occurred. Although this may serve the child well while in that dysfunctional environment, it may also cause the child to react in inappropriate ways, by developing alternate ways in which the energy compulsively surfaces, ways damaging to his or her own interests, when interacting with people in a completely independent environment. Major trauma that occurs later in life, even in adulthood, can sometimes have a profound effect on character. See post-traumatic stress disorder. However, character may also develop in a positive way according to how the individual meets the psychosocial challenges of the life cycle (Erikson).

== Theories ==

=== Freud ===
Freud&#x27;s first paper on character described the anal character consisting of stubbornness, stinginess, and extreme neatness. He saw this as a reaction formation to the child&#x27;s having to give up pleasure in anal eroticism. The positive version of this character is the conscientious, inner directed obsessive. Freud also described the erotic character as both loving and dependent. And the narcissistic character as the natural leader, aggressive and independent because of not internalizing a strong super-ego.

=== Fromm ===
For Erich Fromm character develops as the way in which an individual structures modes of assimilation and relatedness. The character types are almost identical to Freud&#x27;s but Fromm gives them different names: receptive, hoarding, and exploitative. Fromm adds the &quot;marketing&quot; type to describe individuals who continually adapt the self to succeed in the new service economy. For Fromm, character types can be productive or unproductive. Fromm notes that character structures develop in each individual to enable him or her to interact successfully within a given society and adapt to its mode of production and social norms (see social character), and may be very counter-productive when used in a different society.

Fromm got his ideas about character structure from two associates/students of Freud, Sándor Ferenczi and Wilhelm Reich. It is Reich who really developed the concept from Ferenczi, and added to it an exploration of character structure as it applies to body structure and development as well as mental health

=== Reich ===

For Wilhelm Reich, character structures are based upon blocks—chronic, unconsciously held muscular contractions—against awareness of feelings. The blocks result from trauma: the child learns to limit their awareness of strong feelings as their needs are thwarted by parents who meet cries for fulfillment with neglect or punishment. Reich argued for five basic character structures, each with its own body type developed as a result of the particular blocks created due to deprivation or frustration of the child&#x27;s stage-specific needs:

# The schizoid structure, which could result in full blown schizophrenia: this is the result of not feeling wanted by hostile parents, even in the womb. There is a fragmentation of both body and mind with this structure.
# The oral structure is an adaptation to an early wound of deprivation around the basic need for nourishment from birth to approx. 18 months. The oral structure as an adult will sometimes adopt an attitude of &quot;you do it for me,&quot; as a reaction to not having been nurtured when young. At other times the defense is one of compensation where the individual denies their own needs in the belief that needing will result in abandonment. The person loses touch with their healthy natural assertion and aggression and energy tends to collapse and be difficult to sustain. The body adopts a posture where shoulders are usually hunched which contracts the chest and limits breath and therefore the amount of energy the body takes in. The head juts forward, This posture limits energy flow to the arms which then feel weak. The body of the oral structure defends against receiving and thus confirms the belief that they cannot get their needs met, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy unless the defense can be challenged in both mind and body and the individual can mobilize their energy, stand on their own two feet and own the right to need and to receive.
# The psychopath or upwardly displaced structure: this wound, around the age of 3, is around the parent manipulating, emotionally molesting the child by seducing them into feeling &quot;special&quot; for the parent&#x27;s own narcissistic needs. The child resolves to never again permit themselves to be vulnerable, and so decides to instead manipulate and overpower others with their will. The body is well developed above, weak below, as the psychopath pulls away from the ground and attempts to overpower from above. This structure has variations, depending on the admixture with prior wounds: the overbearing is the pure type, the submissive is mixed with oral, the withdrawing, with schizoid.
# The masochist structure: this wound occurs when the parent refuses to allow the child to say &quot;no,&quot; the first step in setting boundaries. The child seeks relief from the rage that builds up underneath bounded muscle and fat, by provoking punishment from others.
# The rigid: this wound occurs around the time of the first puberty, the age of 4. The child&#x27;s sexuality is not affirmed by the parent, but instead shamed or denied. This structure seeks to prove to the parents and others that the child is worthy of love. The rigid structure is often beautifully harmonious, but there is a physical split around the diaphragm between heart and pelvis: love and sex. This person has trouble with being aware of their emotions, which are strong, yet buried. The rigid structure has many substructures, depending on the exact nature of the wound, the admixture with other pre-rigid (oedipal) structures, and the gender: in women, the masculine aggressive, hysterical, and the alternating; in men, the phallic narcissist, the compulsive, and the passive feminine.

While each of these structures has blocks, and these blocks to some degree resemble &quot;armour&quot;, it is only the rigid structure that truly has what Reich called &quot;character armour&quot;: a system of blocks all over the body. Depending on which version of rigid one is, the rigid character possesses either &#x27;plate&#x27; (i.e. clanky) or &#x27;mesh&#x27; (much more flexible) character armour.

<doc id="523252" wikidata="Q2433610" url="?curid=523252" title="Pertuis d'Antioche">
<text>The Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche (, &quot;Passage of Antioch&quot;) is a strait on the Atlantic coast of Western France between two islands; Île de Ré to the north, and Oléron to the south. To the east lies the continental coast between the cities of La Rochelle and the naval arsenal of Rochefort; to the west the open ocean. The channel is above a league in breadth, and at the northern point of Oleron lies a ledge of rocks called the Antioches, with which the channel shares its name. The ledge extends a quarter league wide of the coast of Oleron, obliging traffic to follow the middle of the channel. The position of the ledge, and the entrance to the channel, was in past times marked with a lighthouse. The link with Antioch, a city in Turkey, is unclear.

==History==
The Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche was already active during Roman times, when it saw trade in salt and wine centred on Saintes. Much later, the military rivalry between England and France resulted in the Pertuis being the site of frequent naval engagements.

In the middle-ages, the area sought its independence from the English crown under Richard the Lionheart. Louis XIV made the city of Rochefort one of the great naval bases of his kingdom. He then had fortresses constructed to protect the Rochefort roads. During the Napoleonic wars, the French further fortified the area, most notably with the construction of Fort Boyard. After his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon tried to flee to the United States of America from the Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche, but eventually surrendered to the English navy, which was blockading the area; he was later sent into exile on the island of Saint Helena.

Lastly, during World War II, the Germans occupied the coast and fortified it against invasion. They also built a large submarine base in La Rochelle; this still stands today, and was used as a set for the historical submarine movie &quot;Das Boot&quot;. Even after the Allied invasion of France, La Rochelle remained a pocket of German resistance that surrendered only at the end of the war.

==Geography==
The Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche is bordered by a limestone coast dating back to the Cretaceous, at which time it was deep under water. The weather is oceanic. Although at the same latitude as Montreal, Canada and the Kuril Islands, Russia, the area is quite warm throughout the year, due to the influence of the Gulf Stream waters, and the number of sunny days per year, which is remarkably high, on a par with the French Riviera on the Mediterranean coast of France. With its warm, protected waters, the Pertuis d&#x27;Antioche has become one of the most active tourist and pleasure-boat centres in Europe, with the La Rochelle marina complex at its centre.

<text>Charles James Fox Bennett (11 June 1793 in Shaftesbury, England – 5 December 1883) was a merchant and politician who successfully fought attempts to take Newfoundland into Canadian confederation. Bennett was a successful businessman and one of the colony&#x27;s richest residents with interests in the fisheries, distillery and brewery industry and shipbuilding. His brother Thomas Bennett, a magistrate and member of Newfoundland&#x27;s first House of Assembly, was a partner in the business.

Bennett became involved in politics in the 1840s as a leader of the colony&#x27;s Anglican community and an opponent of responsible government, an argument he lost when an alliance of Catholics and non-Anglican Protestants persuaded the Colonial Office to grant Newfoundland self-government.

In the 1860s, he led the Anti-Confederation Party opposing the proposals by Sir Frederick Carter to join Canada. Bennett&#x27;s party defeated Carter&#x27;s Conservatives on the Confederation issue in the 1869 elections, allowing Bennett to form a government in 1870. However, as Premier he was unable to keep his party united, and in 1874 resigned, allowing Carter to return to power. The issue of Confederation had become a moot point and would not be seriously raised again until the Great Depression.

Bennet also commissioned extensive mineral surveys along the coasts, and in the 1860s developed the prosperous copper mine at Tilt Cove (Notre Dame Bay).

Bennett&#x27;s anti-Confederates reformed themselves into the colony&#x27;s Conservative Party.

<doc id="523261" wikidata="Q1789882" url="?curid=523261" title="List of universities in Malaysia">
<text>This is a list of universities in Malaysia. Universities in Malaysia are generally categorised as public and private universities. Private universities include locally established universities and campuses of foreign universities.

The list below is classified by the two main categories, sequentially ordered by their locations according to states. For the purpose of this list, institutions of higher education that are authorised to confer their own degrees but do not have the status of universities are included under the sub-classification of university college (including institutions not classified as educational institutions under the &quot;Education Act 1996&quot;). Other institutions of higher education which do not have the authority to confer their degrees are listed in a separate article. There may be some duplication in both lists as some institutions provide both bodies regulate accredited training and education in multiple sectors.

In the case of institutions without official translations of their names in English or common used name by the local media, the translation provided by the Association of Commonwealth Universities is used, barring which the most common usage is provided.

== Public universities and polytechnics ==
Public universities in Malaysia are funded by the Government and are governed as self-managed institutions. Apart from the University of Malaya and the MARA University of Technology which were established by two separate enabling Acts of Parliament, the other public universities in Malaysia were created by executive order as per the provisions of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971. Until recently, the Ministry of Higher Education was responsible for seven institutions bearing the title &quot;University College&quot;. These have since been upgraded to full universities, and there are currently no public university colleges.

For polytechnics in Malaysia, it provides courses for bachelor&#x27;s degree, Advanced Diploma, Diploma and Special Skills Certificate.


== Private universities and university colleges ==
The establishment of private universities and university colleges were made possible with the passage of the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996 [Act 555]. Before that, private institutions of higher learning existed but were not authorised to confer their own degrees. Instead, they acted as preparatory institutions for students to undertake courses of instructions in preparation for externally conferred degrees.

<text>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: An Indian History of the American West is a 1970 non-fiction book by American writer Dee Brown. It explores the history of American expansionism in the American West in the late nineteenth century and its devastating effects on the indigenous peoples living there. Brown describes Native Americans&#x27; displacement through forced relocations and years of warfare waged by the United States federal government as part of a continuing effort to destroy the cultures, religions, and ways of life of Native American peoples. 

Brown borrowed the book&#x27;s title from the 1927 poem &quot;American Names&quot; by Stephen Vincent Benét: &quot;I shall not be there. I shall rise and pass. Bury my heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. Wounded Knee was the site of the last major attack by the US Army on Native Americans, and is one of several possible sites of Crazy Horse&#x27;s buried remains.

Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s 1881 book &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot; is often considered a nineteenth-century precursor to Dee Brown&#x27;s book.

&quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; was first published in 1970 to generally strong reviews. Published at a time of increasing American Indian activism, the book has never gone out of print and has been translated into 17 languages.

Before the publication of &quot;Bury My Heart...&quot;, Brown had become well-versed in the history of the American frontier. Having grown up in Arkansas, he developed a keen interest in the American West, and during his graduate education at George Washington University and his career as a librarian for both the US Department of Agriculture and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, he wrote numerous books on the subject. Brown&#x27;s works maintained a focus on the American West, but ranged anywhere from western fiction to histories to children&#x27;s books. Many of Brown&#x27;s books revolved around similar Native American topics, including his &quot;Showdown at Little Bighorn&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Fetterman Massacre&quot; (1974).

==Synopsis==
In the first chapter, Brown presents a brief history of the discovery and settlement of America, from 1492 to the Indian turmoil that began in 1860. He stresses the initially gentle and peaceable behavior of Indians toward Europeans, especially their lack of resistance to early colonial efforts at Europeanization. It was not until the further influx of European settlers, gradual encroachment, and eventual seizure of native lands by the &quot;white man&quot; that the Native peoples resisted.

Brown completes his initial overview by briefly describing incidents up to 1860 that involved American encroachment and Indian removal, beginning with the defeat of the Wampanoags and Narragansetts, Iroquois, and Cherokee Nations, as well as the establishment of the West as the &quot;permanent Indian frontier&quot; and the ultimate breaches of the frontier as a means to achieve Manifest Destiny.

In each of the following chapters, Brown provides an in-depth description of a significant post-1860 event in American Western expansion or Native American eradication, focusing in turn on the specific tribe or tribes involved in the event. In his narrative, Brown primarily discusses such tribes as the Navajo Nation, Santee Dakota, Hunkpapa Lakota, Oglala Lakota, Cheyenne, and Apache people. He touches more lightly upon the subjects of the Arapaho, Modoc, Kiowa, Comanche, Nez Perce, Ponca, Ute, and Minneconjou Lakota tribes.

==Historical context==

===American Indian Movement===
&quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; was published less than three years following the establishment of AIM, the American Indian Movement, formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1968. AIM moved to promote modern Native American issues and to unite America&#x27;s divided Native American population, similar to the Civil Rights and Environmental Movements that gained support at that time. The publication of Brown&#x27;s book came at the height of the American Indian Movement&#x27;s activism. In 1969, AIM occupied Alcatraz Island for 19 months in hopes of reclaiming Native American land after the San Francisco Indian Center burned down. In 1973, AIM and local Oglala and neighboring Sicangu Lakota took part in a 71-day occupation at Wounded Knee in protest of the government of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation chairman Richard Wilson. This resulted in the death of two Indians and injury to a US Marshal. The ensuing 1974 trial ended in the dismissal of all charges due to the uncovering of various incidents of government misconduct.

===Vietnam War===
At the time of the publication of Brown&#x27;s book, the United States was engaged in the Vietnam War. The actions of the United States Army in Vietnam were frequently criticized in the media and critics of Brown&#x27;s narrative often drew comparisons between its contents and what was seen in the media. The primary comparison made was the similarity between the massacre of and atrocities against Native Americans in the late nineteenth century as portrayed by Brown&#x27;s book and the 1968 massacre of hundreds of civilians in South Vietnam at My Lai for which twenty-five US Army troops were indicted. Native American author N. Scott Momaday, in his review of the narrative, agreed with the viability of the comparison, stating &quot;Having read Mr. Brown, one has a better understanding of what it is that nags at the American conscience at times (to our everlasting credit) and of that morality which informs and fuses events so far apart in time and space as the massacres at Wounded Knee and My Lai.&quot;

Thirty years later, in the foreword of a modern printing of the book by Hampton Sides, it is argued that My Lai had a powerful impact on the success of Brown&#x27;s narrative, as &quot;&quot;Bury My Heart&quot; landed on America&#x27;s doorstep in the anguished midst of the Vietnam War, shortly after revelations of the My Lai massacre had plunged the nation into gnawing self-doubt. Here was a book filled with a hundred My Lais, a book that explored the dark roots of American arrogance while dealing a near-deathblow to our fondest folk myth.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; received ultimately positive reviews upon its publication. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reviewed the book:

In the last decade or so, after almost a century of saloon art and horse operas that romanticized Indian fighters and white settlers, Americans have been developing a reasonably acute sense of the injustices and humiliations suffered by the Indians. But the details of how the West was won are not really part of the American consciousness. ... Dee Brown, Western historian and head librarian at the University of Illinois, now attempts to balance the account. With the zeal of an IRS investigator, he audits US history&#x27;s forgotten set of books. Compiled from old but rarely exploited sources plus a fresh look at dusty Government documents, &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; tallies the broken promises and treaties, the provocations, massacres, discriminatory policies and condescending diplomacy.

The Native American author N. Scott Momaday, who won the Pulitzer Prize, noted that the book contains strong documentation of original sources, such as council records and first-hand descriptions. He stated that &quot;it is, in fact, extraordinary on several accounts&quot; and further complimented Brown&#x27;s writing by saying that &quot;the book is a story, whole narrative of singular integrity and precise continuity; that is what makes the book so hard to put aside, even when one has come to the end.&quot;

Peter Farb reviewed the book in 1971 in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;: &quot;The Indian wars were shown to be the dirty murders they were.&quot; Other critics could not believe that the book was not written by a Native American and that Dee Brown was a white man, as the book&#x27;s Native perspective felt so real. Remaining on bestseller lists for over a year following its release in hardback, the book remains in print 40 years later. Translated into at least 17 languages, it has sold nearly four million copies and remains popular today.

Despite the book&#x27;s widespread acceptance by journalists and the general public, scholars such as Francis Paul Prucha criticized it for lacking sources for much of the material, except for direct quotations. He also said that content was selected to present a particular point of view, rather than to be balanced, and that the narrative of government–Indian relations suffered from not being placed within the perspective of what else occurred in the government and the country at the time. UC Davis history professor Ari Kelman also criticized the book for allegedly perpetuating the &quot;Vanishing Indians&quot; myth, stating &quot;[a] hugely popular work of revisionist history intended to document a vibrant Indian past, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee instead reduced Indigenous history to declension, destruction and disappearance&quot;, also claiming &quot;Dee Brown, no matter how sympathetic he intended his portrayal of Native history and peoples, recapitulated antiquated rhetoric about the disappearance of Indians.&quot;

Brown was candid about his intention to present the history of the settlement of the West from the point of view of the Indians—&quot;its victims,&quot; as he wrote. He noted, &quot;Americans who have always looked westward when reading about this period should read this book facing eastward.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film===
HBO Films produced a made-for-television film adaptation by the same title of Brown&#x27;s book for the HBO television network. The film stars Adam Beach, Aidan Quinn, Anna Paquin, and August Schellenberg with a cameo appearance by late actor and former US Senator Fred Thompson as President Grant. It debuted on the HBO television network on May 27, 2007, and covers roughly the last two chapters of Brown&#x27;s book, focusing on the narrative of the Lakota tribes leading up to the death of Sitting Bull and the Massacre at Wounded Knee. The film received 17 Primetime Emmy nominations and went on to win six awards, including the category of Outstanding Made For Television Movie. It also garnered nominations for three Golden Globe Awards, two Satellite Awards, and one Screen Actors Guild Award.

===Children&#x27;s literature===
The author of &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Last Days&quot;, Dwight Jon Zimmerman, adapted Brown&#x27;s book for children in his work entitled &quot;The Saga of the Sioux&quot;. The narrative deals solely with the Sioux tribe as the representatives of the story told in &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; written from the perspective of the Sioux chiefs and warriors from 1860 to the events at the massacre at Wounded Knee. The book includes copious photographs, illustrations, and maps in support of the narrative and to appeal to its middle school demographic.

==History==

=== 1960 to 1966: Darling Downs University Establishment Association (DDUEA) ===
After a meeting of over 200 members of the Toowoomba community on 2 December 1960, the Darling Downs University Establishment Association (DDUEA) was founded with the purpose of establishing a university in the Darling Downs region. Chaired by former mayor of Toowoomba Dr. Alex McGregor, the association successfully lobbied the local, state, and federal government for the establishment of an Institute of Technology located in Toowoomba. After the establishment of the Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs), the association became known as the Darling Downs Association for Advanced Education (DDAAE), and later Darling Downs Unilink Limited. Darling Downs Unilink Limited went into receivership in 1996, with a subsequent auction of the organisation&#x27;s art collection.

=== 1967 to 1971: Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) (QITDD) ===
The Queensland Institute of Technology (Darling Downs) (QITDD) opened on 2 February 1967 in Toowoomba, beginning with 140 foundation students. By 1970, the institution provided studying programs for rural Queensland and international communities.

=== 1971 to 1989: Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE) ===
In 1971, the institute became the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education (DDIAE). Managed by its own College Council, DDIAE educated 75% of the country&#x27;s international students in the 1986–1987 school year. 

On the evening of 11 April 1979, a fire destroyed the Administration Building (B Block). This resulted in the loss of the mailroom and switchboard. The cause of the fire was a staff member activating a bank of light switches which, unbeknownst to them, were also connected to a wall strip heater obscured by computer printout paper. While the damage was significant, student academic records were not affected and the institute was able to continue operating. 
From 1980 to 1990, DDIAE grew significantly from 1,000 to 8,000 full-time student equivalents (EFTSL).

=== 1990 to 1991: University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) ===
It became the University College of Southern Queensland (UCSQ) in 1990, under the sponsorship of the University of Queensland. 

=== 1992 to present: University of Southern Queensland (UniSQ, formerly USQ) ===
In 1992, the institution became the University of Southern Queensland when it gained full university status. The university was a founding member of the Regional Universities Network that was launched in 2011.

<text>The Tibetan Plateau, also known as Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and Qing–Zang Plateau, is a vast elevated plateau located at the intersection of Central, South, and East Asia. Geographically, it is located to the north of Himalayas and the Indian subcontinent, and to the south of Tarim Basin and Mongolian Plateau. Geopolitically, it covers most of the Tibet Autonomous Region, most of Qinghai, western half of Sichuan, Southern Gansu provinces in Western China, southern Xinjiang, Bhutan, the Indian regions of Ladakh and Lahaul and Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) as well as Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan, northwestern Nepal, eastern Tajikistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. It stretches approximately north to south and east to west. It is the world&#x27;s highest and largest plateau above sea level, with an area of . With an average elevation exceeding and being surrounded by imposing mountain ranges that harbor the world&#x27;s two highest summits, Mount Everest and K2, the Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as &quot;the Roof of the World&quot;.

The Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters of the drainage basins of most of the streams and rivers in surrounding regions. This includes the three longest rivers in Asia (the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong). Its tens of thousands of glaciers and other geographical and ecological features serve as a &quot;water tower&quot; storing water and maintaining flow. It is sometimes termed the [[Third Pole]] because its ice fields contain the largest reserve of fresh water outside the polar regions. The impact of climate change on the Tibetan Plateau is of ongoing scientific interest.

== Description ==
The Tibetan Plateau is surrounded by the massive mountain ranges of high-mountain Asia. The plateau is bordered to the south by the inner Himalayan range, to the north by the Kunlun Mountains, which separate it from the Tarim Basin, and to the northeast by the Qilian Mountains, which separate the plateau from the Hexi Corridor and Gobi Desert. To the east and southeast the plateau gives way to the forested gorge and ridge geography of the mountainous headwaters of the Salween, Mekong, and Yangtze rivers in northwest Yunnan and western Sichuan (the Hengduan Mountains). In the west, the curve of the rugged Karakoram range of northern Kashmir embraces the plateau. The Indus River originates in the western Tibetan Plateau in the vicinity of Lake Manasarovar.

The Tibetan Plateau is bounded in the north by a broad escarpment where the altitude drops from around to over a horizontal distance of less than . Along the escarpment is a range of mountains. In the west, the Kunlun Mountains separate the plateau from the Tarim Basin. About halfway across the Tarim the bounding range becomes the Altyn-Tagh and the Kunluns, by convention, continue somewhat to the south. In the &#x27;V&#x27; formed by this split is the western part of the Qaidam Basin. The Altyn-Tagh ends near the Dangjin pass on the Dunhuang–Golmud road. To the west are short ranges called the Danghe, Yema, Shule, and Tulai Nanshans. The easternmost range is the Qilian Mountains. The line of mountains continues east of the plateau as the Qinling, which separates the Ordos Plateau from Sichuan. North of the mountains runs the Gansu or Hexi Corridor which was the main silk-road route from China proper to the West.

The plateau is a high-altitude arid steppe interspersed with mountain ranges and large brackish lakes. Annual precipitation ranges from and falls mainly as hail. The southern and eastern edges of the steppe have grasslands that can sustainably support populations of nomadic herdsmen, although frost occurs for six months of the year. Permafrost occurs over extensive parts of the plateau. Proceeding to the north and northwest, the plateau becomes progressively higher, colder, and drier, until reaching the remote Changtang region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Here the average altitude exceeds and winter temperatures can drop to . As a result of this extremely inhospitable environment, the Changtang region (together with the adjoining Kekexili region) is the least populous region in Asia and the third least populous area in the world after Antarctica and northern Greenland.

== Geology and geological history ==

The geological history of the Tibetan Plateau is closely related to that of the Himalayas. The Himalayas belong to the Alpine Orogeny and are therefore among the younger mountain ranges on the planet, consisting mostly of uplifted sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Their formation is a result of a continental collision or orogeny along the convergent boundary between the Indo-Australian Plate and the Eurasian Plate.

The collision began in the Upper Cretaceous period about 70 million years ago, when the north-moving Indo-Australian Plate, moving at about per year, collided with the Eurasian Plate. About 50 million years ago, this fast-moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the Tethys Ocean, the existence of which has been determined by sedimentary rocks settled on the ocean floor, and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since these sediments were light, they crumpled into mountain ranges rather than sinking to the floor. During this early stage of its formation in the Late Palaeogene, Tibet consisted of a deep palaeovalley bounded by multiple mountain ranges rather than the more topographically uniform elevated flatland that it is today. The Tibetan Plateau&#x27;s mean elevation continued to vary since its initial uplift in the Eocene; isotopic records show the plateau&#x27;s altitude was around 3,000 metres above sea level around the Oligocene-Miocene boundary and that it fell by 900 metres between 25.5 and 21.6 million years ago, attributable to tectonic unroofing from east–west extension or to erosion from climatic weathering. The plateau subsequently rose by 500 to 1,000 metres between 21.6 and 20.4 million years ago. 

Palaeobotanical evidence indicates that the Nujiang Suture Zone and the Yarlung-Zangpo Suture Zone remained tropical or subtropical lowlands until the latest Oligocene or Early Miocene, enabling biotic interchange across Tibet. The age of east–west grabens in the Lhasa and Himalaya terranes suggests that the plateau&#x27;s elevation was close to its modern altitude by around 14 to 8 million years ago. Erosion rates in Tibet decreased significantly around 10 million years ago. The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards; the plateau is still rising at a rate of approximately per year (although erosion reduces the actual increase in height).

Much of the Tibetan Plateau is of relatively low relief. The cause of this is debated among geologists. Some argue that the Tibetan Plateau is an uplifted peneplain formed at low altitude, while others argue that the low relief stems from erosion and infill of topographic depressions that occurred at already high elevations. The current tectonics of the plateau are also debated. The best-regarded explanations are provided by the block model and the alternative continuum model. According to the former, the crust of the plateau is formed of several blocks with little internal deformation separated by major strike-slip faults. In the latter, the plateau is affected by distributed deformation resulting from flow within the crust.

==Environment==

The Tibetan Plateau supports a variety of ecosystems, most of them classified as montane grasslands. While parts of the plateau feature an alpine tundra-like environment, other areas feature monsoon-influenced shrublands and forests. Species diversity is generally reduced on the plateau due to the elevation and low precipitation. The Tibetan Plateau hosts the Tibetan wolf, and species of snow leopard, wild yak, wild ass, cranes, vultures, hawks, geese, snakes, and water buffalo. One notable animal is the high-altitude jumping spider, that can live at elevations of over .

Ecoregions found on the Tibetan Plateau, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature, are as follows:
* The Pamir alpine desert and tundra covers the western end of the Tibetan Plateau where it transitions to the Pamir Mountains
* The North Tibetan Plateau–Kunlun Mountains alpine desert covers the northwestern limits of the Tibetan Plateau along the Kunlun Mountains
* The Karakoram–West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe covers the westernmost parts of the Tibetan Plateau and Ladakh
* The Northwestern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows on the edges mountains bordering the extreme west of the Tibetan Plateau
* The Central Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe covers most of the central portions of the Tibetan Plateau and the eastern Changtang
* The Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows covers the southwestern plateau in the Garuda Valley region
* The Qaidam Basin semi-desert located in the Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau
* The Qilian Mountains subalpine meadows covering the Qilian Mountains in the northernmost portions of the plateau
* The Qilian Mountains conifer forests covering parts of the mountain ranges in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The Tibetan Plateau alpine shrublands and meadows covering a swath of the central and northeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The Yarlung Tsangpo arid steppe in the Yarlung Tsangpo river Valley, where most of the permanent human population on the Tibetan Plateau lives
* The Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows cover the southern Tibetan Plateau on the north side of the Himalayas

* The Southeast Tibet shrub and meadows cover the southeastern and eastern parts of the plateau and are generally rainier than the other high-altitude Tibetan Plateau regions
* The Northeastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests reach up mountain valleys in the southern plateau and contain some of the highest altitude forests in the world
* The Nujiang Lancang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests cover the mountain valleys that reach into the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
* The Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests cover the southeasternmost mountain valleys on the plateau
* The Qionglai–Minshan conifer forests cover the eastern edges of the plateau and are the densest forests to be found anywhere on the Tibetan Plateau

== Human history ==
Extinct humans (Denisovans) lived on the Tibetan plateau from around 200,000 to 40,000 years ago, according to a study published in &quot;Nature&quot;. 

Nomads on the Tibetan Plateau and in the Himalayas are the remainders of nomadic practices historically once widespread in Asia and Africa. Pastoral nomads constitute about 40% of the ethnic Tibetan population. The presence of nomadic peoples on the plateau is predicated on their adaptation to survival on the world&#x27;s grassland by raising livestock rather than crops, which are unsuitable to the terrain. Archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest human occupation of the plateau occurred between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Since colonization of the Tibetan Plateau, Tibetan culture has adapted and flourished in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the plateau. The northern portion, the Changtang, is generally too high and cold to support permanent population. One of the most notable civilizations to have developed on the Tibetan Plateau is the Tibetan Empire from the 7th century to the 9th century AD.

== Impact on other regions ==
=== Role in monsoons ===

Monsoons are caused by the different amplitudes of surface temperature seasonal cycles between land and oceans. This differential warming occurs because heating rates differ between land and water. Ocean heating is distributed vertically through a &quot;mixed layer&quot; that may be 50 meters deep through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating only a meter or so. Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly greater than that of most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the land warms and cools faster than the ocean. In turn, air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than does air over the ocean. The warmer air over land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. The pressure anomaly then causes a steady wind to blow toward the land, which brings the moist air over the ocean surface with it. Rainfall is then increased by the presence of the moist ocean air. The rainfall is stimulated by a variety of mechanisms, such as low-level air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows near the surface. When such lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation and precipitation.

In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean maintains the heat longer. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. Monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes, a term usually referring to the localized, diurnal cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal. The seasonal monsoon wind shift and weather associated with the heating and cooling of the Tibetan plateau is the strongest such monsoon on Earth.

==Glaciology: the Ice Age and at present==
Today, Tibet is an important heating surface of the atmosphere. However, during the Last Glacial Maximum, an approximately ice sheet covered the plateau. Due to its great extent, this glaciation in the subtropics was an important element of radiative forcing. With a much lower latitude, the ice in Tibet reflected at least four times more radiation energy per unit area into space than ice at higher latitudes. Thus, while the modern plateau heats the overlying atmosphere, during the Last Ice Age it helped to cool it.

This cooling had multiple effects on regional climate. Without the thermal low pressure caused by the heating, there was no monsoon over the Indian subcontinent. This lack of monsoon caused extensive rainfall over the Sahara, expansion of the Thar Desert, more dust deposited into the Arabian Sea, and a lowering of the biotic life zones on the Indian subcontinent. Animals responded to this shift in climate, with the Javan rusa migrating into India.

In addition, the glaciers in Tibet created meltwater lakes in the Qaidam Basin, the Tarim Basin, and the Gobi Desert, despite the strong evaporation caused by the low latitude. Silt and clay from the glaciers accumulated in these lakes; when the lakes dried at the end of the ice age, the silt and clay were blown by the downslope wind off the Plateau. These airborne fine grains produced the enormous amount of loess in the Chinese lowlands.

===Frozen biological samples===

Ice of the plateau provides a valuable window to the past. In 2015, researchers studying the Plateau reached the top of the Guliya glacier, with ice thickness of , and drilled to a depth of in order to recover ice core samples. Due to the extremely low biomass in those 15,000-year-old samples, it had taken around 5 years of research to extract 33 viruses, of which 28 were new to science. None had survived the extraction process. Phylogenetic analysis suggests those viruses infected plants or other microorganisms.

===Climate change===

The Tibetan Plateau contains the world&#x27;s third-largest store of ice. Qin Dahe, the former head of the China Meteorological Administration, issued the following assessment in 2009:
The Tibetan Plateau contains the largest area of low-latitude glaciers and is particularly vulnerable to global warming. Over the past five decades, 80% of the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau have retreated, losing 4.5% of their combined areal coverage.

This region is also liable to suffer damages from permafrost thaw caused by climate change.

<text>McDonald Observatory is an astronomical observatory located near unincorporated community of Fort Davis in Jeff Davis County, Texas, United States. The facility is located on Mount Locke in the Davis Mountains of West Texas, with additional facilities on Mount Fowlkes, approximately to the northeast. The observatory is part of The University of Texas at Austin. It is an organized research unit of the College of Natural Sciences.

The observatory produces &quot;StarDate&quot;, a daily syndicated radio program consisting of short segments related to astronomy that airs on both National Public Radio and commercial radio stations — about 400 affiliates in all.

==History==
McDonald Observatory was originally endowed by the Texas banker William Johnson McDonald (1844–1926), who left about $1 million — the bulk of his fortune — to The University of Texas at Austin to endow an astronomical observatory. Edwin Hockaday Fowlkes, step-son of the land&#x27;s original owner John Chandler Prude, donated the land to the University of Texas to build the observatory. The provision of the will was challenged by McDonald&#x27;s relatives, but after a long legal fight, the university received about $800,000 from the estate and construction began at Mt. Locke. The then-unnamed Otto Struve Telescope was dedicated on May 5, 1939, and at that time was the second largest telescope in the world. McDonald Observatory was operated under contract by The University of Chicago until the 1960s, when control was transferred to The University of Texas at Austin under the direction of Harlan J. Smith.

Research today at the McDonald Observatory encompasses a wide variety of topics and projects, including the search for and understanding of planetary systems, stars and stellar spectroscopy, the interstellar medium, extragalactic astronomy, and theoretical astronomy. The Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment, or HETDEX, is a multi-year undertaking to decode the nature of dark energy.

Directors
* Otto Struve (1932–1950)
* Gerard Peter Kuiper (Sept. 1947–Dec. 1949, Sept. 1957–Mar. 1959)
* Bengt Georg Daniel Strömgren (Jan. 1951–Aug. 1957)
* William Wilson Morgan (Apr. 1959–Aug. 1963)
* Harlan James Smith (Sept. 1963–1989)
* Frank N. Bash (1989–2003)
* David L. Lambert (2003–2014)
* Taft E. Armandroff (2014–present)

==Observatory==
McDonald Observatory is equipped with a wide range of instrumentation for imaging and spectroscopy in the optical and infrared spectra, and operates the first lunar laser ranging station. It works closely with the astronomy department of The University of Texas at Austin while maintaining administrative autonomy. The high and dry peaks of the Davis Mountains make for some of the darkest and clearest night skies in the region and provide excellent conditions for astronomical research.

The Otto Struve Telescope, dedicated in 1939, was the first large telescope built at the observatory. It is located on Mt. Locke at an altitude of . The summit of Mt. Locke, accessed by Spur 78, is the highest point on Texas highways. The Harlan J. Smith Telescope, also on Mt. Locke, was completed in 1968.

The Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET), dedicated in late 1997, is located on the summit of Mt. Fowlkes at above sea level. It is operated jointly by The University of Texas at Austin, Pennsylvania State University, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, and Georg-August University of Göttingen. As of 2019, after upgrades the HET is tied with the Keck Telescopes as the second or third largest telescope in the world. However, its cost was about 20% that of other similarly sized telescopes in use today due to its optimization for spectroscopy.

Additionally, The University of Texas at Austin is a founding partner of the international collaboration to build the Giant Magellan Telescope. McDonald Observatory administrators, scientists, and engineers are heavily involved in the endeavor. Director Taft Armandroff currently serves as Vice Chair to the GMT Board of Directors, and has served as chair.

==Telescopes==
Currently, the observatory operates four research telescopes at its West Texas site:
* Hobby-Eberly Telescope on Mt. Fowlkes
* Harlan J. Smith Telescope on Mt. Locke
* Otto Struve Telescope on Mt. Locke
* large format imaging telescope on Mt. Locke

A telescope, formerly used for research, is now used for visitor programs.

===Tenant telescopes===

The two peaks also host a number of other instruments:

* The Monitoring Network of Telescopes (MONET) North Telescope on Mt. Locke is a companion to one at the South African Astronomical Observatory in Sutherland, and was built by Halfmann Teleskoptechnik.
* Two telescopes and one telescope located on Mt. Fowlkes are part of the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network.
* A Ritchey-Chretien reflector owned by Boston University on Mt. Locke is used for optical aeronomy.
* The Robotic Optical Transient Search Experiment (ROTSE) reflector on Mt. Fowlkes is used to search for the optical signature of gamma-ray bursts.

===Former telescopes===

* The Millimeter Wave Observatory (MWO) radio telescope operated on Mt. Locke until 1988. MWO was a joint project between the UT Department of Astronomy and the Department of Electrical Engineering. The site of the dish antenna is now occupied by the &quot;BLOOMhouse&quot;, the UT School of Architecture&#x27;s entry in the 2007 Solar Decathlon, which is now used for staff housing.
* The McDonald Laser Ranging System (MLRS) used a telescope on Mt. Fowlkes from 1982 to 2019 for satellite laser ranging and lunar laser ranging.

==Climate==
The observatory experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cool, dry winters and hot, wetter summers.

*Elevation: 
==Visiting==
The Frank N. Bash Visitors Center, located between Mt. Locke and Mt. Fowlkes, includes a gift shop and interactive exhibit hall. The Visitors Center conducts daily live solar viewings in a large theater and tours of the observatory&#x27;s largest telescopes. It also hosts evening star parties, every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday evening which allow visitors to look through numerous telescopes of various sizes in the Rebecca Gale Telescope Park.

Special Viewing Nights, during which visitors can stay on-site (not required for the programs) and view directly through eyepieces on the 0.9 m and Struve (2.1m) telescopes, are held on a reservation-only basis.

<doc id="523288" wikidata="Q29803" url="?curid=523288" title="Isuzu">
<text>, commonly known as Isuzu (, ), is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture. Its principal activity is the production, marketing and sale of Isuzu commercial vehicles and diesel engines.

The company also has a number of subsidiaries and joint ventures, including UD Trucks, Anadolu Isuzu (a Turkish joint venture with Anadolu Group), Sollers-Isuzu (a Russian joint venture with Sollers JSC - Production stopped in March 2022, Isuzu stake transferred to Sollers in July 2023), SML Isuzu (an Indian venture formerly known as Swaraj Mazda), Jiangxi Isuzu Motors (a Chinese joint venture with Jiangling Motors Company Group), Isuzu Astra Motor Indonesia, Isuzu Malaysia (Isuzu HICOM), Industries Mécaniques Maghrébines, Isuzu Truck (UK), Isuzu South Africa, Isuzu Philippines, Taiwan Isuzu Motors, Isuzu Vietnam, Isuzu Motors India and BYD Isuzu.

Isuzu has assembly and manufacturing plants in Fujisawa, which have been there since the company was founded under earlier names, as well as in the Tochigi and Hokkaidō prefectures. Isuzu-branded vehicles are sold in most commercial markets worldwide. Isuzu&#x27;s primary market focus is on commercial diesel-powered truck, buses and construction.

The company is named after the Isuzu River, the kanji of &quot;Isuzu&quot; (五十鈴), meaning &quot;fifty bells&quot;.

==History==

Isuzu Motors&#x27; history began in 1916, when Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipbuilding and Engineering Co., Ltd. planned a cooperation with the Tokyo Gas and Electric Industrial Company to build automobiles. The next step was taken in 1918, when a technical cooperation with Wolseley Motors Limited was initiated, yielding exclusive rights to the production and sales of Wolseley vehicles in East Asia from knock-down kits. In 1919 came the first ever Japan-produced passenger car, a Wolseley model, the Fifteen A9 15/40 НР at the Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipyard at the Fukagawa Factory. The Wolseley sourced CP truck followed two years later; 550 of these were built by 1927. In 1923 Japan was devastated by the Kanto earthquake which made the fledgling transportation infrastructure that was heavily reliant on government-owned railroads unusable due to the twisted tracks. Heavy construction vehicles were imported from the United States companies GMC and Ford to aid in recovery and reconstruction, and the company sought to contribute by producing locally built construction and heavy duty vehicles. In 1927 the company introduced its 2-ton load capacity &quot;Sumida P-type truck&quot; equipped with an A6 engine and a 1-ton vehicle &quot;Sumida M-type No. 1 bus&quot; equipped with an A4 engine. The name &quot;sumida&quot; was used from the Sumida River as the factory at Fukagawa was close by.

In 1929 IHI Corporation, separated part of its manufacturing business and merged with DAT Automobile Manufacturing Inc. (a predecessor of Nissan) and changed its name to Jidosha Kogyo Co., Ltd. (&quot;Automobile Industries Co., Ltd.&quot;) The names used for the products of this company, marketed as &quot;Sumida&quot; and &quot;Chiyoda&quot;, have special significance in Japan. Chiyoda is a district in Tokyo where the Imperial Palace is located, and Sumida refers to a river that flows through Tokyo approximately east of the Imperial Palace. In 1934 the Tsurumi Factory opened under company name Automobile Industry Co., Ltd. and in 1937 Automobile Industries was reorganized and formed into a new company, Tokyo Automobile Industries Co., Ltd. and was founded with a capital of ¥1,000,000. The company continued to manufacture heavy duty trucks and passenger busses, realizing the need to modernize the transportation infrastructure of Japan, and was one of the primary manufacturers for the Imperial Japanese Army along with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and had a corporate allegiance to the Yasuda Zaibatsu. One of the vehicles it produced for the war effort was the Sumida M.2593 armored personnel carrier. In 1942, Hino Heavy Industries was split off from Tokyo Automobile Industries, becoming a separate corporation. In 1949, the company was renamed Isuzu after the Isuzu River, following a meeting with the Japanese Government&#x27;s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI).
===Etymology===
The word Isuzu translated into English means &quot;fifty bells&quot;—hence the focus on &quot;bell&quot; in both the later Bellel and the Bellett. The name was used from the Isuzu River that flows near to the Ise Grand Shrine, one of Japan&#x27;s most sacred and revered shrines.
===Post World War history===
Truck and bus production of the TX40 and TU60 series and the Isuzu Sumida bus resumed in 1945, with the permission of the occupation authorities. and has remained the primary focus of manufacture for the company, along with diesel engine production. In 1958 a factory was built at Fujisawa, Kanagawa, and in 1959 the Isuzu Elf was introduced as a medium duty cab over commercial truck which is still in production, and was also shared with the Isuzu Journey bus. Isuzu continued to maintain its market presence by providing commercial vehicles by introducing the Isuzu TY in 1966. The company is one of the primary manufacturers of commercial duty trucks and busses for public transportation, to include the Isuzu Cubic, Isuzu Gala and the Isuzu Erga along with the Isuzu Giga.

===Corporate partnerships===
Beginning in 1953 the Hillman Minx passenger car is produced under license of Rootes Group giving the company a passenger car to compete with other Japanese manufacturers, realizing that their resources were limited and therefore sought out international partnerships. The Minx remained in production until 1962, after the 1961 introduction of Isuzu&#x27;s first passenger car, the Bellel, and later the sports coupe Isuzu 117 Coupé. Being a small producer making cars which were somewhat too large and pricey for the Japanese market at the time, Isuzu spent some time looking for a commercial partner. Under pressure from MITI, who were attempting to limit the number of automobile manufacturers in Japan, a cooperation with Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) began in 1966. This joint sales-service collaboration was seen as the first step towards an eventual merger. The Subaru 1000 was even shown in Isuzu&#x27;s 1967 annual vehicle brochure, as a suitable complement to the larger Isuzu lineup. This tie-up was over by 1968, when an agreement with Mitsubishi was formed. This ended even more quickly, by 1969, and the next year an equally short-lived collaboration was entered with Nissan. A few months later, in September 1971, what was to prove a more durable capital agreement was signed with General Motors. This would see GM own Isuzu for the next 35 years.

===Linking with General Motors===
While the company had a long relationship with GM going back to the 1920s, the first investment of GM taking a 34% stake in Isuzu was seen in 1972, when the Chevrolet LUV became the first Isuzu-built vehicle to be sold in the United States. To symbolize the new beginning, Isuzu also developed a new logo for 1974, with two vertical pillars as stylized representations of the first syllable in いすゞ (&quot;Isuzu&quot;). In 1974 Isuzu introduced the Gemini, which was co-produced with General Motors as the T-body Chevrolet Chevette. A modified version was sold in the United States as Buick&#x27;s Opel by Isuzu, and in Australia as the Holden Gemini. As a result of the collaboration, certain American GM products were sold to Japanese customers through Isuzu dealerships. Holden&#x27;s Statesman was also briefly sold (246 examples) with Isuzu badging in Japan during the seventies. Isuzu exports also increased considerably as a result of being able to use GM networks, from 0.7% of production in 1973 to 35.2% by 1976; this while overall production increased more than fourfold in the same period. As a result of the GM joint venture, Isuzu engines were also used by existing GM divisions (some USA-market Chevrolet automobiles had Isuzu powertrains e.g. the Chevette and early S10/S15 trucks manufactured prior to 1985).

In 1981 Isuzu began selling consumer and commercial vehicles under their own brand in the United States. The Isuzu P&#x27;Up was the first model sold to consumers as an Isuzu, rather than as a Chevrolet or Buick, along with the Isuzu Piazza sports car. Isuzu&#x27;s then president Toshio Okamoto then initiated a collaboration with small-car expert Suzuki to develop a global small car for GM, the S-car. A three-way agreement of co-ownership was signed in August 1981, with Isuzu and Suzuki exchanging shares and General Motors taking a 5% share of Suzuki. Following on from this, in 1985 Isuzu and GM established the IBC Vehicles venture in the United Kingdom, producing locally built versions of Isuzu and Suzuki light vans (the Isuzu Fargo and Suzuki Carry); to be sold in the European market under Vauxhall&#x27;s Bedford brand. During this period Isuzu also developed a worldwide presence as an exporter of diesel engines, with their powerplants in use by Opel/Vauxhall, Land Rover, Hindustan, and many others. Two Isuzu model lines (Gemini, Impulse) were marketed as part of the Geo division (Spectrum, Storm) when it was initially launched as a Chevrolet subsidiary. In the domestic Japanese market, OEM deals with other manufacturers were entered to aid the poorly performing passenger car arm. It led to the badging of Suzukis, beginning in 1986, and Subaru small commercial vehicles as Isuzus (Geminett, Geminett II). This OEM tie-up occurred alongside the establishment of SIA (Subaru-Isuzu Automotive), an American joint venture with Fuji Heavy Industries (the parent company of Subaru). Shortly afterwards, the Lafayette, Indiana plant became operational.

===Contraction begins===
Isuzu ended US sales of the Impulse (Geo Storm) in 1992, and the following year it stopped exporting the Stylus (the basis for the Geo Spectrum), the last Isuzu-built car sold in the US.

In 1993 Isuzu began a new vehicle exchange program with Honda, whereby Honda sold the Isuzu Rodeo and Isuzu Trooper as the Honda Passport and Acura SLX, respectively. In return Isuzu began selling the Honda Odyssey as the Isuzu Oasis. Thus, Honda&#x27;s lineup gained two SUVs, and Isuzu&#x27;s lineup gained a minivan. In the Japanese market, the Gemini (Stylus) was now a rebadged Honda Domani and the Aska (originally based on the GM J-car) was a Honda Accord, while Honda received the 2-door MU as the Jazz and the 4-door Trooper as the Horizon.

Isuzu&#x27;s United States sales reached a peak in 1996 after the introduction of the Isuzu Hombre pickup, a badge-engineered GM truck (using the sheetmetal of the Brazil-market Chevrolet S10). Isuzu resurrected the beloved Amigo in 1998, before changing the name of the 2-door convertible to Rodeo Sport in 2001 in an attempt to associate it with the better selling 4-door Rodeo. The new Axiom launched in 2001, with the fictional salesman Joe Isuzu from 1980s advertising campaigns brought back to promote it. Isuzu sales began to slide due to the aging of the Rodeo and Trooper, and poor management and a lack of assistance from GM. The Rodeo Sport was discontinued in 2003, while production of the Rodeo and Axiom ceased a year later. By this point sales in North America had slowed to just 27,188, with the discontinued Rodeo and Axiom making up 71% of that total.

In 1998 GM and Isuzu formed DMAX, a joint venture to produce diesel engines. GM raised its stake in Isuzu to 49% the following year, effectively gaining control of the company, and quickly followed this up by appointing an American GM executive to head Isuzu&#x27;s North American Operations. This marked the first time a non-Japanese executive had held such a high position at Isuzu. In 2001 GM and Isuzu announced plans to share distribution networks and for Chevrolet to market an Isuzu product.

The production version of the VehiCROSS was introduced to the US in 1999, but met with mixed reviews, as its high price tag, unique styling and two-door configuration did not seem to meet with market demands. Production of the VehiCROSS and other sport utility vehicles, including the Trooper, ended in 2001 as part of a major financial reorganization which eliminated almost 10,000 jobs. GM had been pushing the company to focus exclusively on producing commercial vehicles and engines.

The number of Isuzu dealerships in the US began a rapid decline, and by 2005 had only 2 models: the Ascender (a re-badged GMC Envoy) and the i-series pickup truck (a rebadged Chevrolet Colorado). At this point, Isuzu in the US was primarily a distributor of medium duty trucks such as the N-series, sourced both from Japan and US plants in Janesville, Wisconsin and Flint, Michigan. Isuzu had 290 light-vehicle dealers in the US in August 2006, and sold an average of just two Ascenders per dealer per month, and rumors of Isuzu&#x27;s withdrawal from the US market were rampant. Plans to introduce a new Thai-built SUV for 2007 were shelved when Isuzu Motors Limited decided that a new SUV would be too risky, instead proceeding with the launch of the i-series trucks. Despite extremely low sales figures of 12,177 passenger vehicles for 2005 (with leftover Axiom and Rodeos making up 30% of this), Isuzu Motors America announced its first profit in years, mainly due to restructuring cuts.

In early 2002, Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru&#x27;s parent company) bought Isuzu&#x27;s share of Lafayette, Indiana plant, and Subaru Isuzu Automotive (SIA) became Subaru of Indiana Automotive. After eight years of heavy Honda Passport sales and light Isuzu Oasis sales, Honda and Isuzu cooperatively ended their vehicle exchange agreement in 2001. The Oasis was dropped, and Honda replaced the Passport with the Pilot. Isuzu&#x27;s last year for passenger vehicles in Canada was 2001, as Isuzus in Canada were mostly sold at Saturn-Saab dealerships. In late 2002 Isuzu initiated a recapitalization and debt-for-equity conversion plan to stave off a bankruptcy. GM acquired 20% of DMAX, 60% of Isuzu Motors Polska and Isuzu Motors Germany, and the rights to three types of diesel engine technology from Isuzu. by paying 50 billion yen (about US$425 million). GM also paid 10 billion yen (about US$85 million) for a 12% stake in the recapitalized company. GM wrote off its investment in Isuzu in 2001.

Production of the 7-passenger Ascender ended in February 2006 with the closure of GM&#x27;s Oklahoma City Assembly plant, leaving Isuzu with the 5-passenger Ascender, built in Moraine, Ohio and the low-selling i-Series as its only retail products. The company sold just 1,504 vehicles in North America in the first two months of 2006. GM ended its equity investment in Isuzu and sold all its shares to Mitsubishi Corporation, Itochu and Mizuho Corporate Bank; both GM and Isuzu claimed the companies would continue their relationship, but there was no word as of April 12, 2006 on the effect this would have on DMAX operations.


In June 2006 Isuzu and GM agreed to establish a joint venture called &quot;LCV Platform Engineering Corporation (LPEC)&quot; to develop a new pickup. Isuzu said it would use its engineering expertise to develop the pickup and GM would develop derivatives based on the integrated platform. Mitsubishi Corp became Isuzu&#x27;s largest shareholder in October 2006, after it converted all the preferred shares in Isuzu it had held since 2005 into common stock, increasing its shareholding from 3.5% to 15.65%.

In November 2006 Toyota purchased a 5.9% shareholding in Isuzu, becoming the third largest shareholder behind Itochu and Mitsubishi Corporation. The two companies agreed to study possible business collaboration focusing on the areas of R&amp;D and production of diesel engines, related emissions-control, and other environmental technologies. In January 2007 Isuzu and General Motors updated the LCV range with a 3.0 litre common rail diesel engine that had far more torque and power than its predecessor. In August 2007 Isuzu and Toyota agreed to develop a 1.6-liter diesel engine for use in Toyota vehicles sold in European markets. At this point, details of development, production and supply of the diesel engine were still under discussion, but in principle, Isuzu would play the leading role, with production scheduled to begin around 2012.

On 30 January 2008, Isuzu announced its complete withdrawal from the US market, effective 31 January 2009. It would continue to provide support and parts. The decision was due to lack of sales. Some of the lack of sales was blamed on consumer experiences with low quality engines and service. Isuzu had been experiencing a slow decline since the late 1990s. In less than 10 years, they had gone from selling a complete line of cars, trucks, and SUVs, into being a specialized SUV maker, and finally selling only a pair of rebadged, General Motors Trucks. The company continued to sell commercial vehicles in the US.

Isuzu and Toyota shelved development of a clean diesel engine in December 2008.

On 29 January 2009, Isuzu and GM announced that they were in talks to transfer the operation of the medium-duty truck production line in Flint, Michigan to Isuzu for a five-year period. In June, however, GM announced that these talks failed to reach an agreement, and GM instead ceased production of the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC Topkick vehicles on 31 July 2009.

In July 2016, Isuzu and Mazda agreed to collaborate to produce the next-generation pickup trucks for Mazda outside of North America. As a result, the third-generation Mazda BT-50 is built by Isuzu in Thailand since 2020.

Isuzu&#x27;s plant in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh began operations in 2016.

In August 2018, Toyota sold off its 5.9% stake in Isuzu.

In December 2019, Isuzu announced that it had signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding which would eventually see Volvo sell UD Trucks to them. In November 2020, the companies announced that they have signed the &quot;final agreements&quot;, making the memorandum of understanding binding. In April 2021, Isuzu completed UD Trucks acquisition.

In March 2021, Isuzu, Hino, and Hino&#x27;s parent Toyota announced the creation of a strategic partnership between the three companies. Toyota acquired a 4.6% stake in Isuzu while the latter plans to acquire Toyota shares for an equivalent value. The three companies said they would form a new joint venture by April called Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies Corporation with the aim of developing fuel cell and electric light trucks. Toyota would own an 80% stake in the venture while Hino and Isuzu would own 10% each.

==Market presence==


In most of Asia and Africa, Isuzu is known primarily for trucks of all sizes, after Isuzu dropped all sales of sedans and compact cars in the late 1990s due to plummeting sales. In the days when Isuzu sold passenger cars, they were known for focusing on the diesel-engined niche. In 1983, for instance, long before the explosion in diesel sales, diesels represented 63.4% of their passenger car production. In 2009, Isuzu abandoned the United States consumer market due to lack of sales. Isuzu as a corporation has always been primarily a manufacturer of small to medium compact automobiles and commercial trucks of sizes medium duty and larger, but markets around the world show different needs.

Isuzu Motors America discontinued the sale of passenger vehicles in the United States on January 31, 2009. The company explained to its dealers that it had not been able to secure replacements for the Isuzu Ascender and Isuzu i-Series that would be commercially viable. Isuzu sold 7,098 cars in the year 2007. This action did not affect Isuzu&#x27;s commercial vehicle or industrial diesel engine operations in the United States. Isuzu has a contract with Budget Truck Rental to manufacture their rental trucks, shared with Ford, GMC, and Navistar International.

In Australia, Isuzu was for many years a major supplier of light commercial and domestic vehicles to Holden (General Motors). However, by 2008, Holden was sourcing few Isuzus. At this time Isuzu began to sell the D-Max under the Isuzu name.

Isuzu&#x27;s entry in the Thai market proved to be one of its most successful. Its presence in the country began in 1966 when it established a manufacturing facility for pick-up trucks in the Samuthprakarn province with a capacity of 155,000 units per year. The automaker quickly became a market leader so that by 2002, the company transferred its production base from its original location in Fujisawa, Japan to Thailand. Isuzu claimed the largest share of the Thai commercial vehicle market, outperforming its competitors for at least 23 years. By 2006, the company transferred to an industrial zone in Chachoengsao province to support further production expansion. By 2017, Isuzu has been exporting pick-up trucks, with shipments reaching North America, Latin America, Australia, and Japan. In the same year, it announced that its profit climbed 7 percent and has doubled its annual truck production to meet overseas demands.

==Subsidiaries and joint ventures==
===Japan===
The Fujisawa Plant was built and opened for production November 1961. It is located at 8 Tsuchidana, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, and is still producing commercial vehicles for domestic Japanese use and international exports. The Toghichi Plant, located at Hakuchu, Ohira-Machi, Tochigi, Tochigi, is where the engines are currently built. There was a factory at Tono Machi, Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki-shi, Kanagawa Pref. that closed March 2005 that manufactured passenger vehicles.

===Mimamori-kun online service===
Mimamori-kun, which means to watch, monitor, or observe in Japanese (literally &quot;Mr. Watcher&quot;), is a commercial vehicle telematics service developed by Isuzu Motors for monitoring and tracking commercial vehicle operations and movements in Japan. The service uses GPS satellite tracking services, and began February 2004. It is connected to the internet and provides government mandated driver activity logs, and records how long the driver was on-duty and how much time was spent driving. The service also records when the driver took lunch breaks, where the truck stopped and for how long, and when the driver logged off for his duty shift.

The service has been modified for personal use in Japan to keep track of family members, to include the health status of elderly persons and pinpoint the location of children for safety purposes.

Some of the main features include the wireless Internet Digital Tachograph, the first of its kind in Japan, combined with hands-free communication, voice guidance, and text messages displayed from the dispatch office. The system also has a password-enabled vehicle theft prevention feature that will not let the vehicle start without the driver having entered a password.

<doc id="523297" wikidata="Q1226566" url="?curid=523297" title="Dinky Toys">
<text>Dinky Toys was the brand name for a range of die-cast zamak zinc alloy scale model vehicles, traffic lights, and road signs produced by British toy company Meccano Ltd. They were made in England from 1934 to 1979, at a factory in Binns Road in Liverpool.

Dinky Toys were among the most popular die-cast vehicles ever made – pre-dating other popular die-cast marques, including Corgi, Matchbox and Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels.

Vehicles commercialised under the &quot;Dinky&quot; name include cars, trucks, aircraft, military, ships.

== Pre-war history ==

Frank Hornby established Meccano Ltd. in 1908 to make metal construction sets. The company later moved into model railways, with its O gauge clockwork trains appearing in 1920.

In the early 1930s, Meccano made many types of tinplate and other metal cars, such as its Morgan and BSA three-wheelers, mostly in kit form. In 1933, Meccano Ltd issued a series of railway and trackside accessories to complement its O gauge (1/45) Hornby Trains model railway sets. The accessories were first called &quot;Hornby Modelled Miniatures&quot;, but in the April 1934 issue of &quot;Meccano Magazine&quot;, they were given the name &quot;Meccano Dinky Toys&quot; for the first time. In August 1935, the name Meccano was dropped and the marque became DINKY TOYS, which lasted until 1971. By December 1934, the Dinky name was also used for the &quot;Dinky Builder&quot; sets, which were coloured flat metal pieces that could be hinged together to make buildings and vehicles.

One story about the origin of the &quot;Dinky&quot; name is that it derived from a nickname that a friend gave to Frank Hornby&#x27;s daughter. Another version is that when one of Hornby&#x27;s daughters-in-law first saw the models, she called them &quot;dinky&quot;, a Scottish word meaning &quot;neat&quot; or &quot;fine&quot;.

=== The legacy of vehicles ===

In the mid-1930s, six vehicles were released (designated 22a to f), including a sports car, a sports coupe, a truck, a delivery van, a farm tractor, and a tank, all cast in lead. Soon after, the first Dinky model car, a sports car based on the MG Magic Midget, was made available individually, numbered 23. At that time, a series 24 (a-h) was introduced, which included a generic ambulance (made until the late 1940s), a grand sports open four-seater, a grand sports two-seater, a coupé and a limousine. The 24 series was also made in France.

Some smaller vehicles were produced alongside model track workers, passengers, station staff and other O scale trackside accessories. All of the early cars were inaccurate representations and had die-cast metal bodies and chassis, and wheels with rubber tyres. By August 1935, there were around 200 different products in the Dinky Toys range which included die-cast ships, aeroplanes and small trains. Dinky Toys model cars were available individually in trade packs of six cars per pack. Most models were not made available in individual boxes until 1952.

The number of commercial vehicles expanded with the addition of Series 28, which included many delivery vans. In 1935, a new series 30 was introduced which, for the first time, featured accurate likenesses of specific vehicles. They included a generic ambulance, a Daimler saloon, a Vauxhall saloon, a Chrysler Airflow saloon, and a Rolls-Royce saloon. Smaller Matchbox-sized Austin 7 saloons and tourers were also made. At about the same time, several models were also made and marketed in France. Liveries of well-known companies began to decorate the commercial vehicles.

Series 30 included:
*30a Chrysler Airflow Saloon (originally no. 32)
*30b Rolls-Royce
*30c Daimler
*30d Vauxhall
*30e Breakdown car
*30f Ambulance

In 1938, a new Series 36 was introduced. Most of those models were also made after World War II, up to 1948. Production was halted during the war so that the Binns Road factory in Liverpool could produce many items for the war effort. Models in series 36, meanwhile, included a Rover Saloon, a Bentley 2 seat sports coupé, an Armstrong-Siddeley limousine, a British Salmson 4 seater convertible, a British Salmson 2 seat convertible, and a Humber Vogue coupé. Chassis were cast with open holes, saving expense and metal. Provision was made on some models for attachment of metal drivers, but not many appeared before the war, making them more valuable.

Dinky had acute problems on early models with zinc pest, also known wrongly as metal fatigue, caused by impure alloys which caused corrosion between molecules, resulting in cracking of the metal, which would crumble prematurely. That was much more common in the years 1938–1941, and is the main reason why it is rare to find surviving toys in good condition from that period. Some early castings have survived in numbers, while others are rare without some form of damage – such as the 28/2 Series vans. Another theory is that the metal was corrupted by contamination with lead from Hornby train and Dinky Toys production, or lead ties from sacks and foil from cigarette wrappers.

=== Military ===

Between 1937 and 1939, a number of military vehicles were introduced, numbered from 151 to 162. They were painted army green, and consisted of a medium and a light tank, an Austin 7 military car, a six-wheeled truck, a reconnaissance car, a searchlight lorry, an anti aircraft gun, a Vickers Light Dragon artillery tractor with limber and 18-pounder gun. Most interesting were several fairly detailed trailers, including an ammunition trailer, a cooker trailer and a water tank trailer. The military offerings were produced until 1941, though a few select models – the clever (161b) anti-aircraft gun, the (151a) medium tank, and some of the trailers – were also made again from 1946 to 1955.

Pre-war models were fitted with thin diameter 1.626 mm. (0.064 in.) axles, whereas the post-war axles were 2.032 mm. (0.08 in.). The pre-war hubs were smooth, but after the war there was a raised part in the centre of the hub. Tracks on the tanks and the (162a) Light Dragon artillery tractor were made with a wire-link sprocket chain wrapped around the hubs. That gave a mechanical, although not very realistic, appearance to the tracks. The side panels of the anti-aircraft folded and, not only did the gun swivel 360 degrees² but it could be moved from level to about a 50-degree angle upward. The searchlight was also adjustable in horizontal and vertical directions.

Military models were made until the end of production in the late 1970s. A wide variety of military vehicles were produced, such as the jeep-like Austin Champ, which included a driver and passengers.

=== Aircraft and ships ===
==== Aircraft ====
In the early days of the Dinky Toys range, aeroplanes and ships formed a considerable part of the output of the Binns Road factory, along with models of cars, vans and trucks. Both civilian and military aircraft were subjects for the Dinky Toys modellers, and the model of the Spitfire was sold in a special presentation box between 1939 and 1941, as part of &quot;The Spitfire Fund&quot;, to raise money for the supply of a real Spitfire to the Royal Air Force. Some models were clearly identified, whereas others re-issued in 1945 had generic names such as Heavy Bomber (66a) and Two Seater Fighter (66c). The reason for that is not clear, but it may have been that they were not true representations of particular aircraft types. However, there were rumours that some models of aircraft and ships were disguised so that enemy agents would not be able to recognise allied aircraft and shipping from the Dinky Toys models. That was of particular importance in the production of French Dinky models, due to the political friction in Europe before the war and the fact that France was occupied by the Axis forces during hostilities. Those theories do not seem to be valid, because the models with generic names were issued in 1945, after hostilities had ceased.

Production of model aircraft resumed after the war with a mixture re-issues of pre-war models, along with models of new civilian airliners and recently introduced jet-powered aircraft. Production of Dinky planes tailed off in 1968, but was resurgent in 1971 with a range of World War II types complete with battery-powered propellers, as well as modern jet fighters, and even a Sea King helicopter. Those large-scale planes had been developed by Airfix but were made by Meccano Ltd., which had recently been bought by Airfix.

Although the production of aircraft models continued after the war, the heyday of Dinky ships was between 1934 and 1939. The models, which were 1/1200 to 1/1985 scale, were cast from the same unstable alloy that was used across the entire pre-war Dinky range and have therefore suffered from the metal decay that makes survivors all the more rare. Small metal rollers were also included in the design and concealed in the underside of the hull so that the models could be moved smoothly across surfaces. Mirroring the aircraft range, both civilian and military ships were issued, and again, some were disguised.

==== Ships ====
The liner &quot;France&quot; was the only Dinky Toys ship produced in France after the war. It was made partly of zamac and partly of plastic, at the scale of 1/1200. It was not until 1976 that five further models were added to the long line of maritime releases from Dinky Toys. Those were in the larger scale of 1/180 – 1/200.

Models in the pre-war range include:
*50a 
*50b Battle ship Nelson class

== Post-war history ==
No Dinky Toys models were made between 1941 and 1945. The French Meccano factory was occupied by the Germans, some of whom worked for Märklin, and the British factory was on war work but every Christmas a few models would be sold from pre-war stocks. Thus during and after the war a few &#x27;pre-war&#x27; models survived and were sold in 1945. The first new models released after the war were U.S. military jeeps ref.153a in April 1946 in England and ref. 24M in France, it was the first Dinky Toy made at the scale of 1/43. 

Besides some of the military vehicles offered before and after the war, the first significant releases from Dinky in the late 1940s were the 40 series, which were all British saloons. The first new model car released was an Armstrong Siddeley Coupe. These were the opening chapter of the &quot;golden age&quot; of Dinky Toys in the post-war era and represented far greater accuracy and detail than their pre-war relatives. These were very popular and today are often considered by collectors to be the quintessential Dinky Toys models. The 40 series cars were manufactured from better quality alloy, meaning that the survival rate is higher and although originally sold in trade boxes of six, they were renumbered in 1954 and re-coloured in two-tone paintwork in 1956, the Austin Somerset ref. 40j is probably the first model sold in its own individual yellow box. The first two models in the 40 series were in 1:48 scale, while the others were in 1:45 scale. The Jowett Javelin saloon is an interesting case as plans were made, but the model was never issued. More recently, Odgi Models have remade the Jowett and a couple other Dinky Toys Models which were planned but never manufactured.

The series included :
=== Dinky Supertoys ===
As part of the post-war development and expansion of the range, in 1947 Meccano Ltd introduced a series of model lorries modelled to the usual Dinky scale of 1:48, and introduced the altered name of Dinky Supertoys. Some models issued in this line included:

In 1950, Meccano introduced in the Supertoys series a number of Guy Vans finished in appealing period liveries. Each model was an identical all metal box van with opening rear doors. The Guy cab was joined by a Bedford S cab in 1955 and a Guy Warrior cab was introduced in 1960. Later, A.E.C. and other models were also added. Supertoys were commonly packaged in white boxes with thin blue horizontal lines and were marketed all on their own – no longer were these models solely focused on railroad accessories. Still, they did not quite reach the commercial marketing level of later die-cast brands like Corgi Toys or Solido. 

Meccano continued producing detailed Dinky Supertoys commercial vehicles through the fifties and sixties, including such subjects as a Mobile Television Control Room and Camera Van in both BBC and ABC Television liveries, a Leyland test chassis with removable miniature 5 ton weights, a series of military vehicles including a Corporal Erecting Vehicle and missile (a subject also modelled by Corgi Toys at the same time), a range of Thornycroft Mighty Antar heavy haulage transporters complete with loads and a Horse Box in British Railways and later in Newmarket liveries.

In 1965 after the take over of Meccano Ltd. by Lines Brothers, the marque Dinky Supertoys was dropped and the large models were renamed Dinky Toys. Later a new trade mark was registered in France : &quot;Super Dinky&quot; but only a few models were issued with this marque before the production stopped definitely.

=== Post-war car lines ===

Having been well known before the war, Dinky Toys were popular in the United Kingdom in the early 1950s. The smaller cars were in a scale of 1:45, while the larger cars and many Supertoys, as stated above, were in a scale of 1:48, which blended in with O scale railway sets, but many buses and lorries were scaled down further. The scale of the Dinky Toys land vehicles range from 1/27 for the Lunar Roving Vehicle ref. 355 and 1/99 for the Duple Viceroy Luxury coach ref. 293 / 296. Because of the introduction of data processing, the British Dinky Toys range was reorganized in 1954 with a new numbering system – previously model numbers were commonly followed by letters and often sold in sets with several vehicles. Now each model had its own unique three digit catalogue number (with no letters), and cars were now sold in individual boxes. The renumbering also happened in France, but in 1959.
The Dinky Toys ranges became more sophisticated throughout the 1950s. Some cars in the sporty pre-war line were carried on after the war: for example, the Alvis sports tourer, the Sunbeam Talbot, or the Frazer-Nash BMW. These offerings then led to a magnificent line-up in the post war Dinky range, which included a Lagonda, an Armstrong-Siddeley, MG, Sunbeam Alpine, Austin Atlantic, Austin Healey 100, Aston Martin DB3S racer, Morris Oxford saloon and Triumph TR2 sports car. Additionally, several models introduced were American cars, and even now still seem unique choices, such as a 1954 Packard convertible, a 1955 Plymouth Belvedere, a Cunningham racing car, the 1953 and 1957 Studebakers (and a 1957 Packard), a Chrysler New Yorker Convertible, a 1957 Rambler, and a late model Hudson Hornet. In many cases, even domestic British / European vehicle choices for models were not everyday selections, e. g. the Connaught racing car, Maserati Sports 2000, AC Aceca, Humber Hawk, 1954 Bristol LeMans car with large fins – and a Daimler instead of the more routine Jaguar.

Several colourful gift sets of sports and racing cars were offered in the mid-1950s, usually five cars to a set. For example, Gift set no. 4 / 249 offered Cooper-Bristol in British racing green, Alfa Romeo in the Italian red, Ferrari in the blue and yellow of Argentina (Juan Manuel Fangio&#x27;s country),1 H.W.M. in light green and Maserati in the red and white colours of Switzerland. No. 149, the sports car set, offered an MG, Austin-Healey, Sunbeam Alpine, Aston-Martin and Triumph TR-2.

Production of agricultural machinery and implements had occurred since the 1930s, such as the 1933 number 22e Fordson farm tractor, and such offerings were maintained post-war. One interesting model was the odd Opperman 3-wheeled Motocart, a tilting flat-bed vehicle with engine hanging off to the side of its large front wheel.

=== Dublo Dinky ===

In November 1958, Meccano Ltd introduced the Dublo Dinky range of models in 1:76 OO scale, designed to be used with the Hornby railway system. These were relatively cheap to produce – having a one-piece die-cast metal body, a base plate and or windows on some, and plastic wheels. There was the added bonus of being able to compete in the small-scale toy car market which, at the time, was dominated by Lesney&#x27;s Matchbox.

There were a total 15 Dublo models, although with upgrades and modifications there are possibly up to 42 variations (not including box variations) manufactured. All models came boxed. There were no colour changes throughout the short life of Dublo.

Models were well-proportioned and looked similar in style to contemporary Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which came with a horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet as well as one underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not die-cast with moulded lettering as was the case with Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the die-cast body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.

The range met with limited success and the first model was withdrawn in October 1960 having only been on sale for 18 months – there was no replacement. Within 22 months of their launch there were price reductions to 3 models. Further models were withdrawn in May 1961, September 1962 and March 1963 until in November 1963 those models that remained were taken off the shelf six years after the Dinky Dublo line was introduced. Thus ended the production of Dublo Dinky Toys under Meccano who went into receivership two years later.

Five of the Dublo models enjoyed a new lease on life when Meccano was purchased by Lines Brothers.

The range:

* 061 Ford Prefect: Introduced in March 1958 and withdrawn October 1960. Three model variations and one box variation.
* 062 Singer Roadster: Introduced in March 1958 and withdrawn 1960. Two model and one box variation.
* 063 Commer Van: Introduced in March 1958 and withdrawn 1960. Three model and two box variations.
* 064 Austin Lorry: Introduced December 1957; withdrawn 1962. Four model variations and four box variations.
* 065 Morris Pick Up: Introduced December 1957; withdrawn 1960. Two model and one box variation.
* 066 Bedford Flat Truck: Introduced December 1957; withdrawn 1960. Four model variations and two box variations.
* 067 Austin Taxi: Introduced March 1959; withdrawn 1966. Two model variations and two box variations.
* 068 Royal Mail Van: Introduced April 1959; withdrawn 1964. Three model variations and two box variations.

* 070 AEC Mercury Tanker: Introduced October 1959; withdrawn 1964. Two model variations and two box variations.
* 071 Volkswagen Delivery Van: Introduced March 1960; withdrawn 1964. Three model variations and two box variations.
* 072 Bedford Articulated Flat Truck: Introduced June 1959; withdrawn 1964. Two model variations and no box variations.
* 073 Land Rover &amp; Horse Trailer: Introduced September 1960; withdrawn 1966. The most complex of all Dublos; three model variations and three box variations. The horse came in light, medium and dark tan.
* 074 This number was never used : Land Rover was to be marketed as separate but model was never produced.
* 075 This number was never used : Horse trailer was to be marketed as separate but model was never produced.
* 076 Lansing Bagnall Tractor &amp; Trailer: Introduced June 1960; withdrawn 1964. No model variation but two box variations.
* 077 This number was never used : The planned model was to have been an AEC Transporter but model was never produced.
* 078 Lansing Bagnall Trailer (Trade box of 6): Introduced June 1960; withdrawn 1966. Three box variations.

=== Competing with the &quot;Ones with Windows&quot; ===

Dinky offerings at this time were striking, but due to the lack of much competition, development of new models was perhaps a bit slow at least until July 1956, when Mettoy introduced a rival line of models under the Corgi brand name. The most obvious difference was the addition of clear plastic window glazing. While Corgi Toys called their vehicles, &quot;The Ones With Windows&quot;, Meccano Ltd responded by updating the Dinky Toys range and the models from both companies quickly became more and more sophisticated featuring such things as working suspension, &quot;fingertip steering&quot;, detailed interiors, and jewelled headlights. The first model to have jewelled headlights was the no. 196 Holden Special sedan made from 1963 to 1969.

Truck offerings remained continuously creative including a Simca glass truck with a sheet of &quot;glass&quot; (clear plastic) and a mirror (polished aluminium), a Leyland Octopus flatbed truck complete with realistic chain around the bed, a car carrier with a car carrying &quot;trailer&quot;, a Dunlop tyre rack full of tyres, a Berliet truck hauling an electrical transformer, and an intricately detailed Brockway bridgelaying truck. One of the most astounding was the Mighty Antar truck hauling a large gold ship&#x27;s propeller. A wide variety of military vehicles continued under production.

A rival third range of model cars also appeared in 1959 called &quot;Spot-on&quot; which were manufactured in Northern Ireland and produced by Tri-ang, a division of Lines Brothers. This range was kept to one scale, 1:42, also featured mainly British makes, and were comparatively more expensive, never managing to sell as many units as Corgi or Dinky Toys. To compete with Spot-on, the scale of British Dinky Toys was increased to 1:42 in 1963. In 1964 Tri-ang took over the parent Meccano company (which included Hornby trains as well as Meccano itself). Since Dinky Toys were more popular, Spot-On Models were phased out in 1967, although a few cars originally designed for Spot-On were made in Hong Kong and marketed as Dinky Toys. After the take-over, Meccano continued to use the 1:42 scale for many of the English made cars and trucks until 1977. The French factory stuck to 1:43 scale, which it had used since 1947.

=== The Mattel onslaught ===
In 1969, two years after appearing in America, Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels entered the UK model car market. Their low-friction axles and bright paint schemes gave new play value and appeal. Dinky and other British brands rushed to catch up, usually unsuccessfully. Each manufacturer responded with its own version of Hot Wheels innovations–Dinky&#x27;s name was &quot;Speedwheels&quot;. The company continued to make innovative models, with all four doors opening (a first in British toy cars), retractable radio aerials (another first), new metallic paints, and jewelled headlights (pretty, but not very realistic). Such features, however, were expensive to manufacture and toy prices could only be kept low if the quantity was high, and in the face of Mattel&#x27;s creation, Dinky faced an uphill battle.

Though the writing was on the wall, Dinky&#x27;s offerings in the 1970s covered the entire spectrum of vehicles, both real and fictitious. Besides the normal gamut of passenger, sports and racing cars, buses, farm, emergency and military vehicles – cars, aeroplanes and spacecraft were also offered from popular (mostly British) TV shows of the time like &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, the &quot;Pink Panther&quot;, &quot;The Secret Service&quot;, and &quot;Joe 90&quot; (Dinky Toys 1974). It could be argued, though, that it was too little too late, as Corgi Toys had already been offering for several years vehicles from far more well-known shows and movies like &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Daktari&quot;, James Bond, and &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; Dinky&#x27;s seemingly weaker standing made it all the more susceptible to Mattel&#x27;s unstoppable Hot Wheels onslaught. At least the Corgi name still survives as a well-known collectible brand.

Into the 1970s, many British-made Dinky vehicles lost the precision quality of detailing and proportions seen during the two previous decades. Models like no. 186 Jensen FF or no. 213 European Ford Capri were rather chunky and unrefined with thick metal door frames, imprecise grilles, and ungainly doors and bonnets painted in separate colours from the rest of the body. Many just did not look quite right. Others, like the no. 1453 Citroën DS Présidentielle saloon were still impressive–flying French flags, with driver, and battery operated lights. Some of the truck and construction models remained very clever as well, with many moving features, like the Bedford refuse truck or the Taylor Excavator. At this time, Dinky also introduced &quot;Action Kits&quot; which were standard models that came disassembled with build instructions and consisted of about 40 pieces. On the other hand, French Dinky Toys, which had to compete with Solido since 1957, were much more accurate with better paint and sharper details than their British counterparts. The no. 825 DUKW military truck is a good example of the quality of French Dinky Toys.

=== Mini-Dinky ===
A second series of small scale models was introduced four years later in 1967, somewhat larger than the Matchbox range at 1:65. Mini-Dinky Toys, as the range was called, featured opening bonnets, doors and boots and were produced in Hong Kong and the Netherlands, with some construction models designed in Hong Kong as copies of models made in Italy by Mercury. The latter were to a smaller scale ranging from 1:87 to 1:130 depending on the model.

Each model was sold in stackable red plastic garages, with clear removable top and sides. The model would slide out of a double hinged opening door to one end. This was in place of the usual cardboard box. Some Mini-Dinkys were also blister packaged in a dark grey pack (some with garage and some not) with bright yellow lettering (Mini Dinky 2011).

== Television and movie tie-ins ==
Although Dinky Toys were not known as widely for producing television related models as Corgi Toys, they still made a number of vehicles widely known from the small screen. Many of these models were the result of beating Corgi Toys to the signing of a licensing deal with Gerry Anderson&#x27;s Century 21 Productions, whose programmes are immensely popular in the United Kingdom. The French factory produced only one TV series related model: the 1406 Renault 4 Sinpar &quot;Michel Tanguy&quot;.

== Country-specific models ==
=== France ===

In 1912 Frank Hornby set up an office in Paris on Rue Ambroise Thomas to import Meccano toys into France. By 1921, the French market had proved so successful that production of Meccano began in Paris at the newly opened factory on Rue Rebeval, with another plant opening in 1931 in Bobigny where production of the Dinky Toys range would be based. In the early days production consisted mainly of tiny model trains cast in lead, with vehicles gradually increasing in number. By the late 1930s the French Dinky Toys range had begun to diversify from that of the British parent company, concentrating on the products of the French motor manufacturers and eventually including; Citroën, Peugeot, Simca, Renault, Panhard and Ford of France.

During the Second World War the Meccano factory was commandeered by the invading Germans and used in the Nazi war effort. The Bobigny factory was also produced an equivalent toy to the Meccano using the Märklin name. From 1945, the model vehicles were forcibly shod with solid metal wheels and the pumps did not have rubber hoses due to the shortage of rubber which was needed for the army. In the early post war period, rubber was needed badly as the French supply came from Cambodia and Laos in war against France, rubber tyres were not fitted on models until 1950. In 1951, the headquarters and offices which were still at Rue Rebeval closed and Dinky Toys production was now solely based at Bobigny.
In 1951, French Meccano has been the first post-war European manufacturer to introduce 1:43 scale. Initially, the scales of French Dinky Toys were similar to those of English Dinkys. The Citroën Traction Avant (24N), released in 1949, was 1:48, while the Ford Vedette 1949 (24Q), released in 1950, was 1:45, the same scales as used in the British 40 series. But then, in 1946 Meccano France released their first car in 1:43 scale: the Jeep (24M).

By the late 1950s, Italian, German and other marques, like the Dutch DAF were also offered by Dinky Toys of France. Focusing on export, American cars were also made like the late 1950s Studebaker, Chrysler&#x27;s DeSoto, Buick Roadmaster, Plymouth Belvedere Coupe, Chrysler New Yorker convertible and Saratoga sedan, Ford Thunderbird &quot;Squarebird&quot; and Lincoln Premiere sedan. 1960s cars produced by Meccano France were the first Corvair sedan, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird coupe and a 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 sedan.
Some models such as the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia were produced both in France as 24M / 530 and in the UK at the Binns Road plant in Liverpool as number 187. By the 1960s there was virtually no crossover of product between the two countries resulting in a fascinating range that complemented the models. The vast majority of the French Dinky range was only available in the home market, Belgium, Switzerland, U.S.A. and other non-British Commonwealth countries although a few models did make it across the English Channel both before and after the war. Similarly, some examples of the British range of Dinky Toys were exported to France at the same time. The factory at Bobigny closed in 1970 and production moved to the present Meccano factory in Calais where the range continued to be manufactured until 1972 when the final single sheet catalogue spelt the French Meccano-built end for the best known name in die-cast toys. A contract had been signed with the Spanish firm Auto Pilen who received some tools and produced some models both as Dinkys and Auto-Pilens.

=== Spain ===
As import duties were high on finished goods and reduced on components, to get into the Spanish market, Meccano s.a. (France) exported sixteen unpainted and unassembled Dinky Toys to the Novades Poch Company in Barcelona. There the models were finished and fitted with specific Pirelli tyres.

The models are:

* 509 Fiat 850
* 510 Peugeot 204
* 513 Opel Admiral
* 514 Alfa Romeo Giulia
* 517 Renault 8
* 518 Renault 4L
* 519 Simca 1000
* 520 Fiat 600
* 523 Simca 1500
* 530 Citroën DS 19
* 534 BMW 1500
* 537 Renault 16TL
* 553 Peugeot 404
* 558 Citroën 2CV
* 559 Taunus 17M
* 560 Furgoneta 2cv Citroën
In 1974 labour was getting too expensive in France, and Meccano subcontracted the manufacture of some models to Auto Pilen s.a. in Spain. These models had already been made in France and were sold exclusively under the marque Dinky. When the Calais factory closed down some of the recent tools were sent to Liverpool where the models were produced with new baseplates. Some of these tools were later sent to Auto-Pilen where they were modified or updated before being re-issued; however, it is not known if the dies were modified by Meccano or by Pilen. These models were sold in France under the marque Dinky, they were clearly identified as Dinky and as MADE IN SPAIN on the base plate. In Spain they were sold as Pilen and marked as such. Pilen models, most of which were Dinky dies, were very popular and numerous in Spain and commonly sold in El Corte Inglés and Galerias Preciados department stores.

According to a contract between Meccano s.a. and Pilen, the last five so called French Dinkys were in fact Pilen models designed and tooled in Algeciras and fitted with a Dinky Toys base plate. Like the previous series, they were sold in France as Dinky and are very rare and as Pilen in Spain.

They were :
* 11539 VW Siroco 
* 11540 Renault 14
* 11541 Ford Fiesta
* 11542 Simca 1308 GT
* 11543 Opel Ascona

=== South Africa ===

Meccano Ltd exported Dinky Toys to all of the United Kingdom&#x27;s old colonies relatively cheaply because of existing Commonwealth trade agreements. South Africa was one of its big importers.

Around 1952–1954, Meccano Ltd shipped to South Africa a limited-edition set of vehicles for the South African Defence Force. This set included a Motor Truck, a Covered Wagon, an Ambulance, a Dispatch Rider, a Van, a petrol tanker, a fire engine, a road roller, a Mechanical horse and trailer, a loudspeaker van.

When South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961, it imposed a luxury goods import tax, making Dinky Toys very expensive – a potential loss for Meccano Ltd. To resolve this problem, Meccano Ltd began shipping Dinky Toy parts to South Africa in 1962 where models were assembled and painted locally. The import of unfinished goods was not subject to the tax. These models were sold in South Africa between 1962 and 1963 and it is believed that only one batch of each model was produced, making South African Dinky Toys very rare. South Africa also imported Dinky Toys parts from the French factory in 1966 and six models were assembled and painted locally.

Some of the distinguishing features of South African Dinky Toys are:
* The boxes have Afrikaans lettering at the one end and &quot;Printed in South Africa&quot; on the side.
* The colours are often different from those on the same models assembled in the UK.
* The base plates have a glossy finish, whereas the same models released in the UK have matte black base plates.

South African Dinky Toys from Liverpool were:

* 112 Austin Healey Sprite Mk. II
* 113 MG B
* 139 Ford Cortina
* 140 Morris 1100* 
* 141 Vauxhall Victor Estate car
* 142 Jaguar Mk. X.

* 548 Fiat 1800 familiale
* 552 Chevrolet Corvair
* 553 Peugeot 404
* 554 Opel Rekord
* 555 Ford Thunderbird
=== Chile ===
Circa 1967–1973, for reasons related to import substitution, some Dinky Toys were made in Arica, a tax free port at the very north of Chile. Only twelve models are known today, those which in England were packed in clear boxes and were provided in Chile with specific yellow packaging with a red &#x27;globe&#x27; symbol. The boxes were printed with &quot;Armado en Arica&quot; (&quot;Assembled in Arica&quot;). Many of these models were painted in different colours from those made in England. The following are some of the models made in Chile:

* 110 Aston Martin DB5
* 116 Volvo 1800 S
* 129 Volkswagen 1300
* 232 Ford RV 40 (with left hand drive)
* 136 Vauxhall Viva (with left hand drive)
* 153 Aston Martin DB6
* 161 Ford Mustang Fast back
* 170 Lincoln Continental
* 215 Ford GT 40 racing car (with left hand drive)
* 216 Dino Ferrari
* 240 Cooper racing car
* 242 Ferrari 156 racing car
* 243 Formula 1 B.R.M.
=== India ===
Original British-made Dinky Toys had been available in select cities in India from pre-war days until about 1955, when import curbs on toys came into effect. Old stocks of original Dinky toys continued to be available for a few years in Calcutta and other metro areas until supplies were exhausted.

Later, similar to how Corgis became Milton Toys and Matchboxes became Maxwells in India, Dinkys eventually appeared there under a distinct name. In 1963, Meccano closed its Speke factory and sold the dies, the casting machines and remains of spare parts and yellow boxes to S. Kumar &amp; Co. in Calcutta, India. Toys were marketed as Atamco Ltd. products. The toys were first assembled with parts made in Liverpool and packed in original yellow boxes with the Dinky Toys name. The quality was very poor and it is believed that Meccano Ltd. asked S. Kumar &amp; Co. not to use the Dinky name. Kumar then applied stickers with the name NICKY on the boxes to hide the name DINKY. Later when the stock of original boxes ran out, NICKY TOYS boxes of poor quality were printed in India.

These were selected Dinky dies, and not the whole British range – with only 32 different cars and trucks produced. Several aeroplanes were also made.

=== Hong Kong ===
Between 1965 and 1967 six model cars were produced for Dinky Toys in Hong Kong for the lucrative U.S. market. Originally intended to be produced by Spot-On, but re-branded as Dinky Toys when the Spot-On parent company (Tri-ang) bought Meccano Ltd, they were built to the usual Spot-On scale of 1:42. These were all American vehicles:
*57-001 Buick Riviera
*57-002 Chevrolet Corvair Monza
*57-003 Chevrolet Impala
*57-004 Oldsmobile 88
*57-005 Ford Thunderbird
*57-006 Rambler Classic

During 1978 and 1979, production of Dinky Toys in Hong Kong was again resumed. These were poor quality models, however, compared to earlier Dinkys, and an attempt to cut production costs and possibly shift production should the Binns Road Factory close, which it eventually did. So, the last new Dinky Toys made by Meccano were Hong Kong products. These are now some of the most sought after of all Dinky Toys. A few, such as Steed&#x27;s Jaguar from the New Avengers TV series exist as pre-production examples only.

=== Italy ===
In 1980 after the Binns Road factory had closed two models have been made in Italy:
*122 Volvo 265 DL station wagon
*361 Missile firing war chariot

The parts may have been made in England or the tools exported, they were made and assembled by Polistil in Milan.

==Demise and rebirth==

===The Matchbox connection===
Changing fashions in the toy industry, international competition and the switch to cheap labour in lower wage countries meant that the days of British-made toy vehicles like Dinky Toys were numbered. After attempts at simplifying the products as a means of saving costs, the famous Binns Road factory in Liverpool finally closed its doors in November 1979. By comparison, Corgi Toys managed to struggle on until 1983. Matchbox was taken over by Universal International of Hong Kong in 1982. Thus ended the era when UK-made die-cast toy models were dominant.

The Dinky trade-name changed hands many times before ending up as part of Matchbox International Ltd in the late 1980s. This seemed to be a logical and perhaps synergistic development, uniting two of the most valuable and venerated names in the British and world die-cast model car market under one roof. For a time some Matchbox vehicles were sold under the Dinky name. In the 1980s, Matchbox began issuing model cars of the 1950s and 1960s through the &quot;Dinky Collection&quot; – these models were marketed toward adult collectors. The models, like a Wolseley Hornet or a 1953 Buick Skylark convertible, were attractive and honoured the tradition of the Dinky name in realism. In fact these were often even more detailed than original Dinkys, instead resembling something more like Lledo&#x27;s Vanguard range. Still, production stopped after only a few years.

The &quot;Dinky Collection&quot; eventually was absorbed into a themed series offered by Matchbox Collectibles Inc, owned by the US giant Mattel – which portrayed little interest in any historical honoring of the Dinky brand. Mattel has preferred to occasionally re-badge normal Matchbox models with the Dinky name for some editions in certain markets. In some cases 1:43 scale models from the Matchbox era were sometimes given the Dinky name. No new &quot;dedicated&quot; Dinky castings have been created in the Mattel era since Matchbox Collectibles was shut down in 2000.

===Atlas partworks issues===
In 2008 French partworks publishers, Atlas Editions, began to reissue models previously available as Dinky Toys under licence from Mattel. These models were only available by subscription in some European countries, initially France. This range is a twice monthly partwork featuring a particular Dinky Toy model complete with certificate and an information leaflet on the history of the casting and the real model. These models were from brand new tooling as the original Meccano dies had been previously sold to other toy makers worldwide or were destroyed or lost. The castings were similar to original Dinky Toys but the baseplates were marked &quot;Atlas Editions – Made in China&quot; which replaced the &quot;Meccano – Made in England&quot; (or &quot;France&quot;) imprints. The new range is available in the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden.

In 2016, DeAgostini, the parent company of Atlas editions, launched another range of Dinky Toys in the United Kingdom and Italy, this time relaunching some of the range from 2008 onward, but replacing Atlas Editions with DeAgostini on the baseplate. Offerings to the general public were through selected newsagents in Dorset and Milan or by subscription. After a test run of 5 issues the range was discontinued in the UK. In the United Kingdom, the first five models issued were the Triumph TR2, Bedford CA Van, Ford Thunderbird, Morris Mini Traveller and the Jaguar XK120 coupe. In Italy the first three issues were the Citroen DS, Fiat 600 and the Volkswagen beetle. Issue 6 was continued in Italy and eventually Issue 6 was issued in the UK which as of November 2019 stands at issue 44. The Italian range ended after 70 issues in July 2019.

<text>The Verve Pipe is an American rock band from Michigan. It was formed in 1992 in East Lansing by Brian Vander Ark (vocals, guitar), Brad Vander Ark (bass, backing vocals), Brian Stout (guitar), and Donny Brown (drums). They are widely known for their songs &quot;The Freshmen&quot; and &quot;Photograph&quot;.

==History==
In November 1992, Brian Vander Ark of the band &quot;Johnny with an Eye&quot; signed a production deal with producer/engineer Thomas Jansen, owner of Station C Studios Inc. After Jansen produced, recorded and mixed all &quot;Johnny with an Eye&quot; tracks, Jansen was looking for a little more from the band. During this same period of time Jansen was courting Don Brown&#x27;s &quot;Water for the Pool&quot; band to come over and record the rest of their album at Station C Studios. Frazer was then given the job of engineering the rest of their album project. In a conversation with Vander Ark, Jansen advised Vander Ark to call Brown to join the band with one guitar member of &quot;Water for the Pool&quot;. Frazer then engineered Brown&#x27;s drums and vocals, and Stout&#x27;s guitars and vocals, on &quot;Johnny with an Eye&quot; songs, and Vander Arks&#x27;s guitar and vocals on &quot;Water for the Pool&quot; songs. Frazer mixed the new band released their first album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Suffered a Head Injury&quot;. The original 10-song version of the CD is no longer available. A seven-song version, without the original recording of &quot;The Freshmen&quot;, was later released as an EP. The band, known for its energetic live performances, built strong followings during its early years, especially in the college towns of Kalamazoo and East Lansing.

In the fall of 1993, the band released a second album, &quot;Pop Smear&quot;, again working with Jansen for pre-production and basic tracks and Frazer with overdubs and mixing, which helped them gain a devoted following in their native state of Michigan and their eventual signing with RCA Records in 1995. A.J. Dunning replaced Stout on guitar for the recording of &quot;Pop Smear&quot; and remained in the band for their three RCA records. This album featured the popular tracks &quot;Spoonful of Sugar&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;.

Their first major label release was 1996&#x27;s &quot;Villains&quot;, which was a minor hit and launched two respectably selling singles, the first being &quot;Photograph&quot; which charted at #53 on the Billboard Airplay charts, then the No. 5 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit &quot;The Freshmen&quot;, which was their most popular single. On June 28, 1997, the band performed at Edgefest in Barrie, Canada. While performing, someone in the crowd threw a beer bottle towards the stage and it hit Brian Vander Ark in the cheek. The band then left the stage to seek medical attention.

The band came back with a new album, &quot;The Verve Pipe&quot;, in 1999. The album, however, failed to achieve the commercial appeal of its predecessor. The band&#x27;s 2001 release &quot;Underneath&quot; contained the song &quot;Colorful&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Rock Star&quot;, and &quot;Happiness Is&quot;, featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Joe Somebody&quot;.

On September 15, 2009, Brian Vander Ark announced on his website that the band would be releasing a new album called &quot;A Family Album&quot; in October 2009. The band had been approached to contribute a song for a compilation album called &quot;Calling All Kids&quot;, which led to them creating an &quot;entire album of family[-]friendly songs&quot;. It was also noted in the announcement that a new album of rock material would follow the family album. Immediately after the release of the family album, the band undertook a series of small-venue performances, mostly around Michigan and the East Coast.

On March 28, 2014, the band announced on their Facebook page that their first studio album since 2001, titled &quot;Overboard&quot;, would be released on June 17, 2014, and would be followed with a tour. The first single from the album, titled &quot;Crash Landing&quot;, was released on April 1, 2014. The Verve Pipe released their next album, &quot;Parachute&quot;, on February 17, 2017. The band released the album, &quot;Threads&quot;, on November 5, 2021, followed by a supporting tour.

<text>Percy William Kilbride (July 16, 1888 – December 11, 1964) was an American character actor. He made a career of playing country &quot;hicks,&quot; most memorably as Pa Kettle in the &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; series of feature films.

==Early life==
Kilbride was born in San Francisco, California, the son of Elizabeth (née Kelly), a native of Maryland, and Owen Kilbride, a Canadian.

==Career==
Kilbride began working in the theater in 1900, at the age of 12, as a call boy at San Francisco&#x27;s Central Theatre. After five years on the San Francisco stage, he played light-comedy roles for stock companies in Boston, Albany, Syracuse, Trenton, and Philadelphia, and eventually left to become an actor on Broadway. He first played an 18th-century French dandy in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. His film debut was as Jakey in &quot;White Woman&quot; (1933), a Pre-Code film starring Carole Lombard. He left Broadway for good in 1942, when Jack Benny insisted that Kilbride reprise his Broadway role in the film version of &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot;. According to Benny, Percy Kilbride was the same character offscreen and on: quiet and friendly but principled, refusing to be paid more or less than what he considered a fair salary. Kilbride followed up the Benny film with a featured role in the Olsen and Johnson comedy &quot;Crazy House&quot; (1943). In 1945, he appeared in &quot;The Southerner&quot;.
In 1947, he and Marjorie Main appeared in &quot;The Egg and I&quot;, starring Fred MacMurray and Claudette Colbert as a sophisticated couple taking on farm life. Main and Kilbride were featured as folksy neighbors Ma and Pa Kettle, and audience response prompted the popular &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle&quot; series. Pa Kettle became Kilbride&#x27;s most famous role: the gentle-spirited and incredibly lazy Pa seldom raised his voice, and was always ready to help friends—by borrowing from &quot;other&quot; friends, or assigning any kind of labor to his American Indian friends Geoduck and Crowbar.

Because Universal insisted on releasing only one Kettle feature annually, during the spring months, there was already a backlog of unreleased pictures. &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot;, filmed in February 1952, wasn&#x27;t released for another three years. Kilbride withdrew from the series in 1953 after filming &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle Hit the Road Home.&quot; It was released in 1954 as &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Home&quot;.

Kilbride retired only from Pa Kettle, not from acting. Although the Kettle films were lucrative and &quot;Kilbride has had a lot of fun making them,&quot; wrote columnist Frank Scully, &quot;they have cost him a lot of fat parts on the home lot and elsewhere. He was picked for &quot;Return of the Texan&quot; only to be shelved for Walter Brennan because the front office thought it would be too tough a job getting that shiftless Kettle out of the public mind.&quot; In a 1953 interview, Kilbride discussed the monotony of his career due to his portrayal of Pa Kettle:

I had my training on the stage, where I did a variety of roles. That&#x27;s the fun of being an actor: to meet the challenge of creating new characters. But Pa Kettle is always the same. He can do anything; there is no need to establish any motivation. There&#x27;s no kick in doing him over and over again. I have had dozens of offers to do television series, but I have turned them all down. I might do one-shot appearances; but I won&#x27;t let myself get tied down to one character.

Kilbride had tried to break away from Pa Kettle, playing character roles in other films through 1950, but he became so familiar in the Kettle pictures that he wound up playing that role almost exclusively. The one exception was a 1952 industrial film promoting home appliances; Kilbride&#x27;s dry delivery provided, appropriately enough, a voice for a dehumidifier.

Kilbride lived alone in an apartment on Whitley Avenue in Los Angeles, just off Hollywood Boulevard. Pa Kettle was even a dangerous influence on his personal life: &quot;I&#x27;ve reached the time in life when I should own a house and settle down, but I know that Kettle virus would paralyze me when it came to mowing a lawn, sweeping off a porch, or changing a light bulb.&quot;

==Death==
On September 21, 1964, Kilbride and another actor, Ralph Belmont, were struck by a motorist while crossing the street in Hollywood. 

Belmont died instantly; Kilbride died three months later from atherosclerosis and terminal pneumonia which were caused by head injuries, having undergone brain surgery at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles on November 11, aged 76. 

A veteran of World War I, Kilbride was buried at Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California. Kilbride, who never married, left his estate to four nephews and a sister-in-law.

<text>The Lowell family is one of the Boston Brahmin families of New England, known for both intellectual and commercial achievements.

The family had emigrated to Boston from England in 1639, led by the patriarch Percival Lowle (c. 1570–1664/1665). The surname was spelt in many ways until it was standardised as Lowell from about 1721, apparently by the Rev. John Lowell. It was a later John Lowell (1743–1802) from whom the famous dynasty was descended.

==Background==

The Lowells originally settled on the North Shore at Cape Ann after they arrived in Boston on June 23, 1639. The patriarch, Percival Lowle, was born in Portbury before possibly becoming a merchant in Bristol and later arriving in the New World.

By the 19th and 20th centuries, the Lowells descended from John Lowell (1743–1802) were widely considered to be one of America&#x27;s most accomplished families.

Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop needed solid, dependable people to settle the North Shore area as a buffer against the French from Canada and urged that the Lowells relocate to Newburyport on the Merrimack River, at the border of the failing Province of Maine.

==Ancestry in the UK==

===Origin of the name===
Many suggestions about the origins of the medieval name Lowle were offered during the late 20th century. Some argued that it was Welsh or Saxon while others supported the name was of Norman origin. One possibility is that it originates from the Latin word lupellus (wolf-cub) from Latin lupus (wolf).

Lowell family historian Delmar R. Lowell, gave much weight and persuasion to the origins of the name Lowle in his work and he and others concluded the Lowles of England were unquestionably of Norman descent.

There were still Louels in Scotland on the Scottish Marches in the Royal Burgh of Roxburgh when Edward Longshanks, King of England, ordered the nobility and gentry in Scotland to swear an oath of allegiance to him in the Ragman Roll in 1291. It is during this period, in 1288, that the earliest documentation for the name Lowle appears. William Lowle of Yardley in Worcestershire is documented as a yeoman, and standing as a witness to a border dispute between two of his neighbours. It is from this period that Delmar Lowell traces the descent of the Lowles through England until their departure for the colonies.

Documentation for this period also exists in The National Archives of England showing that there were also Lowels in the Welsh Marches. In 1317, William de Braose, 2nd Baron Braose petitioned King Edward II, the King&#x27;s Council, and the Parliament to request that Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March send two justices to arrest and bring to trial 200–300 men he accused of attacking his Knights and Ministers and for, &quot;trespasses made against the King&#x27;s peace to Brewose and his people of Gower.&quot;, a peninsula, part of Glamorgan in Wales. Members named in this band of men included Ieuan and Griffith Lowel for the attack at Eynon.

===Coat of arms===

The Harleian Society, a British publisher of the official Royal Heraldic visitations, describes the Lowle Coate of Arms from the herald&#x27;s records taken in Somersetshire in the years 1573, 1591, and 1623.
* Blazon: Sable, a dexter hand couped at the wrist grasping three darts, one in pale and two in saltire, all in argent.
* Crest: A Stag&#x27;s head cabossed, between the attires a pheon azure.
* Motto: Occasionem Cognosce (oh-kay-see-OH-nem kogg-NOHS-keh).

The coat of arms has a shield with black field displaying a right hand cut-off at the wrist and grabbing three arrows, one vertical and two crossed diagonally, in silver; above the shield is a male deer&#x27;s head with a barbed, broad arrowhead in blue between its antlers. A loose translation of the family motto is &quot;Know Your Opportunity.&quot;

The use of the Lowle coat of arms has varied slightly between the generations; some families omitted the pheon azure or substituted blunted bolts for the pointed darts; and one generation, notably a pastor, used an urn in his families crest instead of the stag&#x27;s head. The right for a man to bear arms traditionally passes from father to eldest son; occasionally subsequent generations change the coat of arms to reflect their lives or vocations better, sometimes even &quot;quartering&quot; their coat of arms with another family by way of marriage.

Some believe that the Lowle coat of arms fell into abeyance when Percival Lowle and his sons emigrated to Massachusetts. They were still subjects of the Crown and its favor until the colonies declared Independence from Britain in 1776 and were entitled to bear their coat of arms. Also, there were a number of Lowles who remained in England who could claim the right.

<doc id="523314" wikidata="Q1268307" url="?curid=523314" title="Dvaravati">
<text>Dvaravati () was a medieval Mon political principality from the 6th century to the 11th century, located in the region now known as central Thailand, and was speculated to be a succeeding state of Lang-chia or Lang-ya-hsiu (). It was described by Chinese pilgrims in the middle of the 7th century as a Buddhist kingdom named &quot;To-lo-po-ti&quot; situated to the west of Isanapura (Cambodia), to the east of Sri Ksetra (Burma), and adjoined Pan Pan in the South. Its northern border met &quot;Chia-lo-she-fo&quot;, which was speculated to be either &quot;Kalasapura&quot;, situated along the coast of the Bay of Bengal somewhere between Tavoy and Rangoon, or Canasapura in modern northeast Thailand. Dvaravati sent the first embassy to the Chinese court around 605–616.

Dvaravati also refers to a culture, an art style, and a disparate conglomeration of principalities of Mon people. The Mon migrants as maritime traders might have brought the Dvaravati Civilization to the Menam Valley around 3000 BCE, which continued to the presence of a &quot;Proto-Dvaravati&quot; period that spans the 4th to 5th centuries, and perhaps earlier.

The center of the early Davaravati was speculated to be Ayodhyapura (present-day Si Thep) but the power was shifted to the lower basin in Lavo&#x27;s Lavapura in the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise of the Angkor in the lower Mekong basin around the 11th–13th centuries, the Menam Valley and the upper Malay peninsula conquered of Tambralinga&#x27;s king Sujita who also seized Lavo in the mid-10th century, the 9-year civil wars in the Angkor in the early 11th century, which led to the devastation of Lavo, as well as the Pagan invasion of Menam Valley around the mid-10th century. All of these potentially are the causes of the fall of the Dvaravati civilization.

In the 11th century, Dvaravati&#x27;s succeeded polity, mentioned as Xiān () by the Chinese and Đại Việt sources, was formed in the lower Menam Basin. This new polity was later known as the Ayutthaya Kingdom in the mid-14th century. Its capital&#x27;s full name also referred to Dvaravati; &quot;Krung Thep Dvaravati Si Ayutthaya&quot; (). All former Dvaravati principalities, Lavo, the northern cities of the Sukhothai Kingdom, and Suphannabhum, was later incorporated to the Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1388, 1438, and the mid-15 century, respectively. According to the Burmese Inscription of Hsinbyushin of Ava A.D. 1768 (Serial No. 1128), which was found on a bronze gun at Shwezigon Pagoda, and acquired by the Burmese in 1767, the Burmese continued to refer to Ayutthaya as Dvaravati by describing the &quot;conquest of Dvāravati (Siam)&quot; even after its fall to a Burmese invasion during the Pagan Kingdom. Several genetic studies published in the 2020s also founded the relations between the Mon people and Siamese people (Central Thai people) who were the descendants of the Ayutthaya.

== History ==
The culture of Dvaravati was based around moated cities, the earliest of which appears to be U Thong in what is now Suphan Buri Province. Other key sites include Nakhon Pathom, Phong Tuk, Si Thep, Khu Bua and Si Mahosot, amongst others. A Khmer inscription dated 937 documents a line of princes of Canasapura started by a Bhagadatta and ended by a Sundaravarman and his sons Narapatisimhavarman and Mangalavarman. But at that time, the 12th century, Dvaravati began to come under constant attacks and aggressions of the Khmer Empire and central Southeast Asia was ultimately invaded by King Suryavarman II in the first half of the 12th century. Hariphunchai survived its southern progenitors until the late 13th century, when it was incorporated into Lan Na.

The term Dvaravati derives from coins which were inscribed in Sanskrit &quot;śrī dvāravatī&quot;. The Sanskrit word &quot;dvāravatī&quot; literally means &quot;that which has gates&quot;. According to the inscription N.Th. 21 found in 2019 in Wat Phra Ngam in Nakhon Pathom, dated the 6th century, three regional cities were mentioned, including Śrīyānaṁdimiriṅga or Śrīyānaṁdimiriṅgapratipura, then Hastināpurī and Dvāravatī, which made Nakhon Pathom where the fractions was discovered probably the center of Dvāravatī.

The traditional chronology of Dvaravati is mainly based on the Chinese textual account and stylistic comparison by art historians. However, the results from excavations in Chan Sen and Tha Muang mound at U-Thong raise questions about the traditional dating. Newly dated typical Dvaravati cultural items from the site of U-Thong indicate that the starting point of the tradition of Dvaravati culture possibly dates as far back as 200 CE. Archaeological, art historical, and epigraphic (inscriptions) evidence all indicate, however, that the main period of Dvaravati spanned the seventh to ninth centuries. Dvaravati culture and influence also spread into Isan and parts of lowland Laos from the sixth century onward. Key sites include Mueang Fa Daet in Kalasin Province, in Nakhon Ratchasima Province, and many others.

==Government==
Little is known about the administration of Dvaravati. It might simply have been a loose gathering of chiefdoms rather than a centralised state, expanding from the coastal area of the upper peninsula to the riverine region of Chao Phraya River. Hinduism and Buddhism were significant. The three largest settlements appear to have been at Nakhon Pathom, Suphanburi, and Praak Sriracha, with additional centers at U Thong, Chansen, Khu Bua, Pong Tuk, Mueang Phra Rot, Lopburi, Si Mahosot, Kamphaeng Saen, Dong Lakhon, U-Taphao, Ban Khu Mueang, and Si Thep.

According to the Chinese record during the Tang Dynasty, Dvaravati has two vassal kingdoms, including Tou Yuan (陀垣) near the present-Chanthaburi, and an island kingdom Tanling (曇陵), whose exact location remains unknown.

A study on Dvaravati settlement patterns before the 14th century in the upper Chi-Mun River basin suggests that Dvaravati might have been made up of several kingdoms linked by trade networks and centered at supra-regional level settlements, such as Dong Mueang Aem, Phimai, Mueang Fa Daet Song Yang, , Non Mueang, and Si Thep.

==Rulers==

The excavation in several sites found silver coins dated the 7th century that mentioned the king and queen of the kingdom written in Sanskrit with Pallava script: &quot;śrīdvaravatīsvarapunya&quot; (King Sridvaravati, who has great merit) and &quot;śrīdvaravatīsvaradevīpuṇya&quot; (the goddess of the meritorious King Dvaravati). In addition, the copper plate dating from the 6th–mid 7th centuries found at U Thong also mentions King Harshavarman (หรรษวรมัน), who was assumed by Jean Boisselier to be one of the kings of Dvaravati, while George Cœdès considered the plate was brought from the Khmer Empire, and the name mentioned might be the Khmer king as well. However, the periods seem unrelated since King Harshavarman I of Khmer reigned from 910–923, 200 years later than the age of the inscription, and Harshavarman I&#x27;s grandfather was Indravarman I, not Isanavarman as the inscription mentioned.

The following is a list of rulers of Dvaravati.

== Art ==

Dvaravati itself was heavily influenced by Indian culture, and played an important role in introducing Buddhism and particularly Buddhist art to the region. Stucco motifs on the religious monuments include garudas, makaras, and Nāgas. Additionally, groups of musicians have been portrayed with their instruments, prisoners, females with their attendants, soldiers indicative of social life. Votive tablets have also been found, also moulds for tin amulets, pottery, terracotta trays, and a bronze chandelier, earrings, bells and cymbals.

<text>Interstate 890 (I-890) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in the vicinity of Schenectady, New York, in the United States. The highway runs southeast–northwest from an interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90) northwest of Schenectady to another junction with the thruway south of the city and passes through Downtown Schenectady along the way. Most of I-890 is six lanes wide, including a section that runs above an industrial section of Schenectady on an elevated highway. I-890 is a local, toll-free alternative to the thruway, which bypasses the city and its suburbs to the southwest.

The section of I-890 west of Downtown Schenectady was mostly built over what was once part of New York State Route 5S (NY 5S). I-890 was constructed in stages during the 1960s and 1970s, and NY 5S was gradually cut back to its current terminus west of Schenectady as more pieces of I-890 were completed. The highway is one of four Interstate Highways in New York to use distance-based exit numbering, the result of a New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) experiment from the 1970s. In Schenectady County, I-890 is designated as the Schenectady County Veterans Memorial Highway.

==Route description==
I-890 begins at the toll booth for exit 26 of the New York State Thruway in the Schenectady County town of Rotterdam. It initially heads to the east, connecting to NY 890 and NY 5S by way of a modified trumpet interchange that directly feeds into the thruway junction. At this point, I-890 takes over the four-lane right-of-way established by NY 890 to the north and follows the Mohawk River (Erie Canal) and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Selkirk Subdivision rail line southeast toward Schenectady. The first of I-890 passes through mostly undeveloped, wooded areas, a trend that finally ends as the highway curves east to meet the north end of NY 337 at exit 2 near the Via Port Rotterdam shopping mall. Continuing on, I-890 follows the Mohawk River along the northern edge of General Electric&#x27;s Schenectady plant, connecting to the facility by way of two separate exits serving different parts of the complex.
Not far from the General Electric plant is Downtown Schenectady, which the now six-lane I-890 largely bypasses to the south and west on an elevated highway passing over a mostly industrial section of the city. The section closest to the city center runs past by the campus of Schenectady County Community College and provides panoramic views of Downtown Schenectady. I-890 heads south from downtown, crossing over the Delaware and Hudson Railway and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Hudson Subdivision before finally connecting to downtown by way of Broadway at exit 5. Past Broadway, the elevated highway comes to an end as I-890 heads southeastward into a dense residential area on a plateau overlooking the city. The homes are not visible from I-890, however, as the freeway is lined on both sides by a thick line of trees serving as noise barriers.

The residential section of Schenectady is served by a single exit for Michigan Avenue, a local street that connects to NY 146 at a junction two blocks north of I-890. From here, the freeway passes under NY 146 before curving to the south and exiting the city limits. Now back in the town of Rotterdam, I-890 runs parallel to NY 146 to an interchange with NY 7. The state route joins I-890, following the highway as it narrows to four lanes and crosses back over the Hudson Subdivision rail line. I-890 and NY 7 connect to High Bridge Road (County Route 48) at exit 8, the last junction in a residential area and the last in Schenectady County. Exit 9, located just south of the Albany County line in a lightly developed commercial area, serves as the end of NY 7&#x27;s its wrong-way concurrency with I-890; the southbound exit also links to NY 146 by way of a long ramp connecting to the state route. I-890 ends a short distance south of the exit at the toll booths for exit 25 of the New York State Thruway.

The section of I-890 in Schenectady County is designated as the Schenectady County Veterans Memorial Highway. Exit numbering on I-890 is distance-based, a holdover from a NYSDOT experiment during the early 1970s. However, because of how the exits are spaced along I-890, the exit numbers end up being mostly sequential anyway, with the only evidence of distance-based numbering being the existence of exit 4C. I-890 is one of four Interstate Highways in New York that first utilized milepost-based exit numbering in contrast to the sequential exit numbering used elsewhere in New York.

==History==

The original riverside roadway along the southern bank of the Mohawk River in western Schenectady was designated as part of NY 5S in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 5S entered the Schenectady area on River Road and followed River and Rice roads and Erie Boulevard into Downtown Schenectady, where it ended at NY 5. In the initial plans for the Interstate Highway System, outlined by the Bureau of Public Roads in the 1955 &quot;Yellow Book&quot;, the city of Schenectady would be served by two highways: one bypassing the city to the southwest (the New York State Thruway) and another that would loop north of the bypass route to serve Downtown Schenectady. The western portion of the loop route would run through the NY 5S corridor.

The first section of I-890 to be completed was the portion from New York State Thruway exit 25 southeast of Schenectady to Altamont Avenue (NY 146), which opened to traffic as I-890 . A short extension to Brandywine Avenue was completed by 1964. By 1968, all of I-890 west to modern exit 3 was complete and open to traffic. As planned, I-890 replaced NY 5S from Downtown Schenectady to exit 3, where NY 5S now terminated. The remainder of the expressway was built . NY 5S was cut back to I-890 exit 2 in the mid-1970s, then to its modern eastern terminus in the late 1980s following a reconfiguration of the interchange linking I-890 to New York State Thruway exit 26.

<doc id="523318" wikidata="Q1702424" url="?curid=523318" title="Johnny Ventura">
<text>Juan de Dios Ventura Soriano (8 March 1940 – 28 July 2021), better known as Johnny Ventura nicknamed , was a Dominican singer and band leader of merengue and salsa. 

In 2004, he received the Latin Grammy Award for Best Merengue/Bachata Album for his album &quot;Sin Desperdicio&quot;; also, he was nominated for Best Merengue Album (2006), Best Contemporary Tropical Album (2010) and Best Salsa Album (2016) categories. In 2006, he received the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2022, he entered the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame.

The merengue legend was a legislator of the Lower House between 1982 and 1986. He also served as vicemayor of Santo Domingo from 1994 to 1998, and as mayor of Santo Domingo from 1998 to 2002.

==Early history==
He began his career as a singer when he presented himself with some friends in a program of devotees which was broadcast by &quot;La Voz de la Alegría&quot; weekly. The young Ventura, only 16 years of age, obtained first place of the participants. A little later, he started appearing in the programs of devotees which were sponsored by La Voz Dominicana. When Ventura Soriano appeared for the first time in the TV show: La TV busca una estrella, that was broadcast Friday night at seven, they rang the bell. In the following week, like a champion, Juan de Dios returned to be welcomed in the same competition. He practiced, worked and was crowned for the hit. Then he won first prize. Thereupon he won a lot of prizes in the devotees programs, until he was finally rewarded with the much desired scholarship which the broadcasting company, property of José Arismendy Trujillo Molina, gave for young talents. With La Voz Dominicana Juan de Dios studied music, vocal techniques and expression. This made Ventura one of the most famous singers in Latin America.

==Political career==
*Ventura was elected Deputy to the National Congress from 1982 to 1986.
*He was Vice Mayor of Santo Domingo, Capital of the Dominican Republic, from 1994 to 1998.  
*He was Mayor of Santo Domingo, Capital of the Dominican Republic, from 1998 to 2002.

==Musical career==
In 1959, Juan de Dios decided to take the name &#x27;Johnny Ventura&#x27;. He started his career as a singer in several bands that presented themselves at the dances in La Feria. He worked with the orchestra of Rondón Votau and in 1961 with the band of the Dominican percussionist Donald Wild.

In 1962 he sang with Combo Caribe of Luis Pérez, with whom he recorded &quot;Cuidado Con el Cuabero&quot;, of which he was the author, and &quot;La Agarradera&quot;, of Luis Pérez. It was with this band that he recorded his first LP consisting of 12 songs.

In 1963, Johnny Ventura was recruited by the musical director Papa Molina to join La Super Orquesta San José, of which he was the director at that time. He joined as singer and as player of the güira. For two years Ventura was part of La Super Orquesta with stars such as Vinicio Franco and Grecia Aquino. Although no records remain of this group, this period was a landmark in his career.

In 1964, the Cuban impresario Angel Guinea insisted that Johnny Ventura create his own orchestra, the &quot;Combo Show&quot; which is known as an important part of the history of popular Dominican music.

In 1965, with his orchestra, Ventura recorded for the Fonogram label the albums &quot;La Coquetona&quot;, &quot;La Resbalosa&quot; and &quot;El Turun Tun Tun&quot;. In 1967 he travelled to the United States, where he immediately became a star. He is credited with the song &quot;La muerte de Martin&quot;, with the voice of Luisito Martí, the Combo Show made their first golden record with &quot;Ah..! Yo No Se... No&quot; (1971).

In 1999, Ventura was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame and won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the same organization in 2003.

In 2006, Ventura was presented with the Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award by the Latin Recording Academy in recognition of his career.

He has been compared to American singer Elvis Presley.

== Personal life and legacy ==
On 28 March 2020, Ventura announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and was hospitalized. On 13 April 2020, he announced he had recovered and had tested negative for the coronavirus.

Ventura died from a heart attack on July 28, 2021, at the age of 81.

Ventura&#x27;s son, Jandy, also a musician who has branded himself as &quot;El Legado&quot; (&quot;The Legacy&quot;), released &quot;Yo Soy El Merengue&quot; with his father eight months after his death. It&#x27;s unclear whether they recorded the song before Johnny&#x27;s death or whether Jandy used an old, unreleased recording of Johnny. Jandy also collaborated with Milly Quezada and Carlos Vives to release &quot;Buscando Al Caballo (Homenaje a Johnny Ventura)&quot; on May of 2022.

<text>Information metabolism, sometimes referred to as informational metabolism or energetic-informational metabolism, is a psychological theory of interaction between biological organisms and their environment, developed by Polish psychiatrist Antoni Kępiński.

==Overview==
Kępiński described his psychological theory in several books
but the most detailed description is given in his 1974 book &quot;Melancholy&quot; (in Polish: &quot;Melancholia&quot;). 
In order to explain psychological phenomena encountered in humans, he borrowed many concepts from the field of cybernetics which gained popularity in Poland at that time, thanks to the works of Marian Mazur (the father of the Polish school of cybernetics). Kępiński starts with the consideration of most basic organisms and how they are different from inanimate matter. First of all, any organism may be treated as an autonomous but open system, separated from its environment by means of a boundary (skin or cell membrane). As an open system, it is engaged in a continual exchange with its surroundings. That exchange may be regarded as twofold i.e. energetic and informational. For the sake of analysis, one may think of energy metabolism and information metabolism as separate processes. Kępiński postulates that life is sustained if both metabolisms are occurring, and it stops if one of them is ceased.

The energy metabolism concept is relatively easy to understand. The molecules of the body are continually replaced. Catabolic and anabolic processes occur in cells. Information metabolism is the other side of the same process, but it concerns the structural aspect (i.e. how matter and energy is organized) and how control is executed. During the energy exchange, the organism strives to maintain its characteristic order (negentropy) and projects that order onto the surroundings. Due to that, the order of the surroundings is destroyed. By contrast, inanimate matter does not have the ability to raise or even maintain its negentropy, because spontaneous natural processes are always accompanied by entropy generation.

===Two biological laws===

Information metabolism may be generally seen as the exchange of signals between the organism and its environment, but also as the processing of signals originating in the organism. These signals must be interpreted in relation to some goals. For all organisms these goals are predicated on two biological laws: the first law states that an organism must be oriented towards its own survival. The second law states that the preservation of the species is equally important. 
Kępiński noticed that these objectives are conflicting. The conflict between the two biological laws is often the source of ethical dilemmas. There are times when the organism needs to sacrifice its life in order to save its offspring. Sometimes it is forced to fight with the representatives of its own species, in order to protect itself. The first biological law is egoistic and related with withdrawal from reality (escape, destruction of reality etc.). The second biological law is altruistic and requires turning towards the reality (sexual reproduction requires union with the partner).

In case of humans, the connection between the goals of various everyday actions and two biological laws is less direct, nevertheless these laws still motivate us. Humans are able to project themselves into the future, think abstractly and consciously and therefore their goals may possess transcendent and symbolic character. This fact is typically expressed as belief in a higher good or an afterlife.

===The hierarchy of value===

It is impossible to keep track of all information generated by various processes occurring in reality. As organisms strive to fulfill two biological laws, proper selection of signals becomes a central problem. According to Kępiński, a hierarchy of value is necessary in order to integrate information. In humans, that hierarchy comprises three levels i.e. biological, emotional and sociocultural. The first two levels are handled subconsciously. The third level, by contrast, is associated with consciousness. From the biological perspective, the number of processes occurring simultaneously in the organism and its physical surroundings is virtually infinite. There is also infinite number of ways in which these processes may be framed. That complexity must be reduced, as only selected signals may be sensed and processed in the nervous system. Moreover, the signals must be ordered according to their present and future relevance. The structure of the body and locations of various receptors are evolutionally adapted to assure isolation of the most relevant signals from the surrounding environment. The internal structure of the body is adjusted to ensure proper integration of information. Of all signals collected by the receptors, only the most important ones reach the level of subjective experience. At the level of signals reaching the field of subjective experience, attention is actively directed (with the help of emotions) towards those related with two biological laws. Perception is not passive and inclusive, but anticipatory and selective. Above biological and emotional levels of signal interpretation, there is the frame of social and cultural norms of the community, which serves as reference for conscious decisions. The sociocultural background plays significant role in people&#x27;s lives.

===Two phases of information metabolism===

The division of information metabolism into two phases is loosely based on the analysis of the orienting response. Information metabolism is initiated by the perception of a change in the internal or external environment of the organism. In the first phase, the organism seeks to obtain direct information about the perceived phenomenon. Because of that, it must turn its attention &#x27;outside&#x27; to the reality. The perceived phenomenon is then subconsciously evaluated. The result of that evaluation manifests itself as an emotion. The sign of the invoked emotion may be positive or negative. This emotion, arising quickly and automatically, serves as the background for the second phase of information metabolism.

In the second phase, the organism executes a locomotor reaction to the phenomenon. Motion towards the source of the stimulus is performed if the stimulus signifies a positive possibility. If the stimulus was evaluated negatively in the first phase, then it is likely that the executed reaction will take the form of escape, fight or immobilization. During the second phase, the organism is primarily occupied by its own actions. It observes their effect and makes adjustments (which forms a feedback loop). Despite the feedback, its connection with reality is less intensive than during the first phase. The separation from reality in the second phase of information metabolism is greater in complex animals and reaches its maximum in humans.

===Functional structures===

The term &quot;functional structure&quot; was used by Kępiński to denote two phenomena. Firstly, the term was used to denote the reaction of an organism to a stimulus. Secondly, it denoted the model of reality generated in the mind in the second phase of the information metabolism. 
In the case of humans, the number of possible functional structures associated with the first phase of information metabolism is limited. These include, for example, endocrine reactions of the autonomous nervous system and basic locomotor patterns.

The range and complexity of functional structures generated in the second phase is much broader. Humans possess the ability to generate many possible models of reality in response to a newly perceived phenomenon. Functional structures can be relatively complex. They include predictions regarding the behavior of objects in the environment as well as the planned sequence of actions of the individual. Typically, multiple functional structures are generated in the second phase of information metabolism, but only one is embodied (executed). The ones that were generated but rejected, gradually fall into the unconscious and form the Jungian shadow. If particular structure is embodied, the probability of its selection in the future increases. Forgotten structures may manifest themselves in the least expected moment. That situation is known as the possession by the Shadow. Kępiński mentioned that the embodied reaction is a signal to other organisms. It always takes the form of motion (or lack of it). 
In case of humans, it may be speech (according to Kępiński, speech is the highest form of motion).

===Emotional coloration===

Emotional coloration manifests in the first phase of information metabolism. It signifies the general attitude of the organism towards the stimulus. This attitude may be either positive or negative. It depends on the nature of the stimulus and on the physical condition of the organism in the moment of perception. The individual has very little conscious control over the feeling that arises. It is selected at lower levels of neurophysiological operation. Selection of an attitude in the first phase (positive or negative) limits the character of functional structures generated in the second phase. Although typically there are many possible ways of reacting, they are limited by the emotional background appearing in the first phase.

The reality is not static but it always evolves, even though some regularities and laws may be identified. Due to that, the effort associated with organizing the world adequately to our own needs continues through the whole life. It cannot be ceased because of the second law of thermodynamics.
In order to decrease its own entropy and the entropy of its immediate surroundings, the organism must expend energy. This is subjectively experienced as the feeling of difficulty, effort or burden. Integrative effort is inherent to life. This effort is rewarded by positive emotional state – the feeling of satisfaction associated with the overcoming of obstacles and advancing towards important goals. By contrast, negative feelings, such as anxiety or fear, signify danger. In case of anxiety, this danger is typically distant in time and space and not known precisely. Fear, on the contrary, signifies close and specified threat to the integrity of the organism.

In healthy individuals, the balance between negative and positive emotions is on the side of the positive. They are more willing to engage in the exchange of information with the environment and to undertake tasks associated with the integrative effort. By contrast, depressive patients withdraw from reality, which lowers their rate of information metabolism. In many cases, the predisposition to depression is caused by the lack of warm and friendly maternal environment during childhood. The presence of friendly and safe maternal environment during childhood is crucial for the development of the general positive attitude towards the environment. If the childhood environment is hostile, the attitude of withdrawal is reinforced and becomes automated.

===The problem of authority===

Life may be seen as conflict between two orders – the order of the individual and the order of the environment. As a process placed between these two orders, information metabolism becomes the tool for establishing the right balance of authority (&quot;I am in control&quot; versus &quot;I am controlled&quot;). 
In pathological cases, the individual may aim to gain absolute control over their environment, or quite contrarily, to fully submit to some external power (i.e. their partner, a political group etc.). The need for an absolute control cannot be fulfilled, therefore it frequently takes the form of fantasy, which sometimes becomes indistinguishable from reality (e.g. in schizophrenia). 
Many individuals submit to revolutionary movements, promising a utopian future, and to social ideologies which offer simple answers to complex life problems. They give up their individual responsibility to find relief from the burdens of life. In his reflections on information metabolism, Kępiński tried to explain psychological mechanisms which made the atrocities of the Second World War possible.

===The anatomical basis of information metabolism===

It is traditionally assumed that functional structures associated with the subjective experience of emotions and moods (the first phase of information metabolism) are controlled by phylogenetically older parts of the brain (diencephalon and rhinencephalon), while those generated in the second phase of information metabolism, subjectively experienced as thoughts, are associated with the neocortex.

===The mathematical character of information metabolism===

The mathematical character of information metabolism is twofold. Receptors, acting as inputs for the metabolized signals, operate analogically to analog electronic devices. The processing of signals in the remaining part of the nervous system is binary (the response of a neuron may be twofold: null – no response, or 1 – when the action potential is released). Due to these characteristics, organisms may be considered analogous to digital systems.

==Reception==
Kępiński&#x27;s books are regarded as classics of Polish psychiatric and philosophical literature. Because of the interest in his work, his most important books have been reissued several times (recently in 2012–2015 by Wydawictwo Literackie). 
Kępiński&#x27;s work was evaluated by the reviewers as insightful, comprehensive and unique. Nevertheless, his concept of information metabolism has been criticized as controversial by some scholars. The controversy was related with the fact that some elements of the theory cannot be verified by the scientific method because it is hard to design appropriate experiments. In response to these objections, psychiatrist Jacek Bomba pointed out that information metabolism was never meant to be a scientific theory, but rather an anthropological model, which accurately integrates the findings of neurophysiology, psychology, social science and medicine.

Philosopher Jakub Zawiła-Niedźwiecki noted that current reading of Kępiński has to correct for his work mostly being pre-scientific from before the evidence-based medicine, modern philosophy of the mind and cognitive psychology era. He enlisted two Kępiński&#x27;s propositions that are currently considered incorrect i.e. the proposition that information metabolism has its control center (the homunculus argument) and the view that brain is only used in 30%. Nevertheless, as noted by Zawiła-Niedźwiecki, these concepts were not central in Kępiński&#x27;s theory and can be safely rejected. He also reminded that Kępiński was sceptical about methods that lacked strong scientific basis, e.g. psychoanalysis, and rejected magical thinking in general. 

During his life, Kępiński mentioned that his model of information metabolism is not complete. The work upon it was interrupted by his illness and death. Some researchers took his work and developed their own theories based on it. Kokoszka used the conception of information metabolism as the basis of his model of the states of consciousness. Struzik proposed that information metabolism theory may be used as an extension to Brillouin&#x27;s negentropy principle of information. 

Based on the Kępiński&#x27;s work and Jungian typology, Lithuanian economist Augustinavičiūtė proposed her pseudoscientific theory of information metabolism in human mind and society, known as socionics.

<text>Harrington Lake () is the summer residence and all-season retreat of the prime minister of Canada, and also the name of the land which surrounds it. The farm that surrounded most of the lake was the property of Margaret and John Harrington. John could not farm the land and moved to the local town of Iron Sides (now Old Chelsea). The family stayed on the farm for many years and eventually moved to old Ottawa. The property is located near Meech Lake—where the Meech Lake Accord was negotiated in 1987—approximately 35 kilometres northwest of Ottawa, in Gatineau Park, amidst the Gatineau Hills in Quebec. The property is not open to the public, but the Mackenzie King Estate, the retreat of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King at Kingsmere, is a tourist attraction located 2 kilometres south in the park.

==Description==
Since 1986, the 5.4-hectare (13-acre) property at Harrington Lake has been managed by the National Capital Commission. The property includes four recreational buildings; the land, which formerly consisted of cultivated fields, has reverted to secondary forest.

In addition to the main cottage with its view over the lake, the Harrington estate includes the following structures:
* staff cottage
* upper guest cottage
* lower guest cottage
* boat house and paddleboat dock
* long dock (located the northeast of the retreat)

The lake itself and the area around it are referred to as &quot;Lac Mousseau&quot;. The French name &quot;Mousseau&quot; comes from another early settler to the area, Louis Mousseau, who bought property in 1867.

The retreat is accessed by Chemin de Lac Meech with a gatehouse, staffed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Protective Policing Service, at the driveway of the retreat. The prime minister&#x27;s motorcade accesses Harrington Lake from Ottawa via Quebec Autoroute 5.

==History==
Several families came in the 19th century to settle the Harrington Lake area, including the Harrington and the Mousseau families. The lake eventually became known as &quot;Harrington Lake&quot; in English and &quot;lac Mousseau&quot; in French. The Mousseau family had built a farm on the shores of the lake, which remained in the family for several decades. Since the land was not suitable for farming, the lumber industry replaced it as the primary economic activity. In the early 20th century, two Americans, W. A. Drum and W. L. Donnelly, built a sawmill at Harrington Lake to serve the lumber industry.

In the 1920s, Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Macpherson Edwards, a member of a prominent lumbering family in Ottawa, inherited part of the property from his uncle, Senator William Cameron Edwards (who had owned 24 Sussex Drive). He recognized the value of the land for recreation, as well as for lumber. He purchased more land around the lake, expanding his total holdings to some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres). He also ordered the demolition of the mill buildings at Harrington Lake, and replaced them with a 16-room cottage that was designed in the Colonial Revival style, very common in the 1920s according to the NCC, but with the addition of large fieldstone chimneys.

In 1951, the lake and the property (including neighbouring land belonging to William Duncan Herridge and Stanley Healey) were acquired by the King in Right of Canada to build up preserves of natural areas around the capital. In 1959, supporters of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker suggested that he needed a quiet place to go fishing, not too far from Ottawa. Later that year, Harrington Lake was chosen as the site for an official country residence and the buildings were formally designated as a secure residence for Canada’s prime ministers.

During the first prime ministership of Pierre Trudeau, his then-wife, Margaret, added a vegetable garden; according to Kim Campbell&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Time and Chance&quot;, the garden still provided the house with fresh produce at the time of that writing. Campbell was the only prime minister to have spent her entire term in office residing at Harrington Lake. Initially, Campbell took up residence at Harrington Lake so that her predecessor, Brian Mulroney, could continue to reside at 24 Sussex Drive until renovations on his new private residence in Montreal were completed. Once Mulroney vacated 24 Sussex, Campbell had not finished moving to that address before her party was defeated in the 1993 election.

<text>Toda people are a Dravidian ethnic group who live in the State of Tamil Nadu in southern India. Before the 18th century and British colonisation, the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including the Kota, Badaga and Kurumba. During the 20th century, the Toda population has hovered in the range 700 to 900. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted &quot;a most disproportionate amount of attention from anthropologists and other scholars because of their ethnological aberrancy&quot; and &quot;their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs&quot;. The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social and physical anthropology, as well as ethnomusicology.

The Toda traditionally live in settlements called &quot;&quot;, consisting of three to seven small thatched houses, constructed in the shape of half-barrels and located across the slopes of the pasture, on which they keep domestic buffalo. Their economy was pastoral, based on the buffalo, whose dairy products they traded with neighbouring peoples of the Nilgiri Hills. Toda religion features the sacred buffalo; consequently, rituals are performed for all dairy activities as well as for the ordination of dairymen-priests. The religious and funerary rites provide the social context in which complex poetic songs about the cult of the buffalo are composed and chanted.

Fraternal polyandry in traditional Toda society was fairly common; however, this practice has now been totally abandoned, as has female infanticide. During the last quarter of the 20th century, some Toda pasture land was lost due to outsiders using it for agriculture or afforestation by the State Government of Tamil Nadu. This has threatened to undermine Toda culture by greatly diminishing the buffalo herds. Since the early 21st century, Toda society and culture have been the focus of an international effort at culturally sensitive environmental restoration. The Toda lands are now a part of The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-designated International Biosphere Reserve; their territory is declared UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Population==

According to M. B. Emeneau in 1984, the successive decennial Census of India figures for the Toda are: 1871 (693), 1881 (675), 1891 (739), 1901 (807), 1911 (676) (corrected from 748), 1951 (879), 1961 (759), 1971 (812). In his judgment, these records 
&quot;justif[y] [sic] concluding that a figure between 700 and 800 is likely to be near the norm, and that variation in either direction is due on the one hand to epidemic disaster and slow recovery thereafter (1921 (640), 1931 (597), 1941 (630)) or on the other hand to an excess of double enumeration (suggested already by census officers for 1901 and 1911, and possibly for 1951). Another factor in the uncertainty in the figures is the declared or undeclared inclusion or exclusion of Christian Todas by the various enumerators ... Giving a figure between 700 and 800 is highly impressionistic, and may for the immediate present and future be pessimistic, since public health efforts applied to the community seem to be resulting in an increased birth rate and consequently, one would expect, in an increased population figure. However, earlier predictions that the community was declining were overly pessimistic and probably never well-founded.&quot;

==Culture and society==

The Toda are most closely related to the Kota both ethnically and linguistically.

===Clothing===
The Toda dress consists of a single piece of cloth, which is worn as a wrap over a &quot;dhoti&quot; for men and as a skirt for women along with a shawl wrap.

===Economy===
Their sole occupation is cattle-herding and dairy-work. Holy dairies are built to store the buffalo milk.

===Marriage===

They once practiced fraternal polyandry, a practice in which a woman marries all the brothers of a family, but no longer do so. All the children of such marriages were deemed to descend from the eldest brother. The ratio of females to males is about three to five. The culture historically practiced female infanticide. In the Toda tribe, families arrange contracted child marriage for couples.

===Houses===

The Todas live in small hamlets called &quot;s&quot;. The Toda huts, called &quot;s&quot;, are of an oval, pent-shaped construction with sliding door. This sliding door is placed inside the hut, and is arranged and fixed on two stout stakes, as to be easily moved back and forth. These huts called dogles are usually high, long and wide. They are built of bamboo fastened with rattan and are thatched. Thicker bamboo canes are arched to give the hut its basic bent shape. Thinner bamboo canes (rattan) are tied close and parallel to each other over this frame. Dried grass is stacked over this as thatch. Each hut is enclosed within a wall of loose stones.

The front and back of the hut are usually made of dressed stones (mostly granite). The hut has a tiny entrance at the front, about wide and tall, through which people must crawl to enter the interior. This unusually small entrance is a means of protection from wild animals. The front portion of the hut is decorated with the Toda art forms, a kind of rock mural painting.

===Food===
The Todas are vegetarians and do not eat meat, eggs that can hatch, or fish. The buffalo were milked in a holy dairy, where the priest/milkman also processed their gifts. Buffalo milk is used in a variety of forms: butter, butter milk, yogurt, cheese and drunk plain. Rice is a staple, eaten with dairy products and curries. 
==Religion==

Toda religious life and practices stem from a pantheon of gods. The heads of this pantheon are the goddess Tökisy and the god of the underworld Ön. These two deities form the basis of many religious practices and rituals, but each Toda clan has their own nòdrochi, a deity seen as that clan’s ruler during the time that the Todas and gods lived together. In total, there are between 1,600 and 1,800 gods.

According to the Toda religion, Ön and his wife Pinârkûrs went to a part of the Nilgiri hills, known as the Kundahs, and set up an iron bar from one end to the other. Ön stood at one end and pulled buffalos out from the earth, which became the sacred buffalos. Pinârkûrs stood on the other end, and she pulled out the buffalos that would form the ordinary herd. The first Toda man also came from the earth, holding onto the tail of the last buffalo Ön pulled out. He then pulled out a rib from the man and created the first Toda woman.

The mountains and hills of their home region are a large part of their religion for two reasons: the importance of grass for buffalo herds and the belief that the hills are the homes of the gods. There is a belief that the gods lived on the hills prior to the creation of the Todas, and that special meetings would take place on a single hill. Each hill associated with a god features a stone circle called a pun. It is unknown who created the puns, but it seems that the Todas did not due to their lack of traditions associated with the stone monuments.

Toda religious tradition is directly tied to the buffalo herding practices. Every part of the dairy process is ritualized including “the twice daily milking and churning of butter to the great seasonal shifting of pastures, the burning over of the dry pastures, and the giving of salt to the herd.” Dairies take up the role of temples in Toda religion. At the dairies, the milk of the buffalos is separated into two qualities: low grade milk, called tarvali, and high grade milk, called kudrpali. There is not a distinction between what buffalos can produce tarvali or kudrpali other than a sacred bell worn by buffalos used to make kudrpali. Additionally, the Todas practice ritual calf sacrifice. The practice is derived from a story where the god Kwoto tricked the gods into eating the flesh of a slain buffalo calf. Since then, this ceremony has taken place every year.

Funerals in the Toda religion are far more celebratory compared to western funerals. The dead are prepared with slaughtered buffalo to accompany them to the afterworld. The buffalos for this process are chased and captured before slaughter as an opportunity for the men to demonstrate their prowess. People also gather in their best clothes for festivities and dancing. There are specific areas dedicated to funeral ceremonies separated for men and women. A hut is made in these areas where the body is prepared. Due to the celebratory nature of Toda funerals, outsiders are typically invited to participate in the festivities.

In Toda religion, divination exists as a separate entity from the buffalo centric practices. Diviners work in pairs and explain misfortunes that have occurred in the Toda villages like the burning down of a dairy. The reasons typically would be that the one seeking explanation committed some offense or that a sorcerer caused the misfortune. In the case of one committing an offense, the diviner would offer a ritual or prayer to make amends for their offense. In the case of a sorcerer, the diviner would identify which sorcerer cast the spell that caused the misfortune. Information about sorcery and sorcerers is limited as it seems to be a taboo practice in Toda culture. However, sorcery is believed to be a familial practice that is passed down from father to son. Toda sorcery is feared by the Todas themselves as well as other tribes like the Badagas.

The Toda religion exalted high-class men as holy milkmen, giving them sacred status as priests of the holy dairy. According to Sir James Frazer in 1922 (see quote below from &quot;Golden Bough&quot;), the holy milkman was prohibited from walking across bridges while in office. He had to ford rivers by foot, or by swimming. The people are prohibited from wearing shoes or any type of foot covering.

Toda temples are distinct from Hindu temples and are constructed in a circular pit lined with stones. They are similar in appearance and construction to Toda huts. Women are not allowed to enter or go close to these huts that are designated as temples.

==Language==
The Toda language is a member of the Dravidian family. The language is typologically aberrant and phonologically difficult. Linguists have classified Toda (along with its neighbour Kota) as a member of the southern subgroup of the historical family proto-South-Dravidian. It split off from South Dravidian, after Kannada, but before Malayalam. In modern linguistic terms, the aberration of Toda results from a disproportionately high number of syntactic and morphological rules, of both early and recent derivation, which are not found in the other South Dravidian languages (save Kota, to a small extent.)

==Culture==

The forced interaction with other peoples with technology has caused a lot of changes in the lifestyle of the Todas. They used to be primarily a pastoral people but now, they are increasingly venturing into agriculture and other occupations. They used to be strict vegetarians but now, some people eat meat.

Although many Toda abandoned their traditional distinctive huts for houses made of concrete, in the early 21st century, a movement developed to build the traditional barrel-vaulted huts. From 1995 to 2005, forty new huts were built in this style, and many Toda sacred dairies were renovated. Each has a narrow stone pit around it and the tiny door is held shut with a heavy stone. Only the priest may enter it. It is used for storage of sacred buffalo milk.

==Embroidery==

Registrar of Geographical Indication gave GI status for this unique embroidery, a practice which has been passed on to generations. The status ensures uniform pricing for Toda embroidery products and provides protection against low-quality duplication of the art.

<doc id="523329" wikidata="Q1132697" url="?curid=523329" title="Corgi Toys">
<text>Corgi Toys (trademark) is the brand name of a range of die-cast toy vehicles created by Mettoy and currently owned by Hornby, after it acquired the Corgi Classics Limited Company in 2008.

The Mettoy (&quot;Metal Toy&quot;) company was founded in 1933 by German émigré Philip Ullmann in Northampton, England, where he was later joined by South African–born German Arthur Katz, who had previously worked for Ullmann at his toy company Tipp and Co of Nuremberg. After dabbling for some years in the model car market, they decided to produce a range of die-cast toy vehicles as competition to Meccano&#x27;s Dinky model cars, which had dominated the British market for many years. &quot;Corgi Toys&quot; were introduced in the UK in July 1956 and were manufactured in Swansea, Wales, for 27 years before the company went into liquidation. A management buy-out re-formed the company as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. In 1989, the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of &quot;Microlink Industries Ltd&quot;. In 1995, Corgi regained its independence as a new company, Corgi Classics Limited, and moved to new premises in Leicester. The Corgi brand was acquired by Hornby in 2008.

The range was exported worldwide and sold in large numbers. Some of the best known and most popular models were of cars made famous in film and television such as the Batmobile, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and James Bond&#x27;s Aston Martin DB5 – which remains the largest selling toy car ever produced. Although the largest single vehicle type featured in the Corgi Toys range were models of cars from manufacturers around the world, this article sub-divides vehicles into genres, wherever possible, to allow a more detailed look at the variety of models produced by the company.

==Early history==

Mettoy became established in Northampton and within six years of the company&#x27;s founding, the Northampton factory had 600 employees.
A production plant was built at Fforestfach in Swansea, South Wales, to manufacture the new range of Corgi Toys. This provided many new jobs in an area of high unemployment following the scaling down of local coal mining operations.

Prior to the introduction of Corgi Toys, Mettoy mainly produced tin plate toys. However, in the early 1950s, they began producing a few products in cast metal. The first was a large scale wind-up racer made with a cast aluminium body and tin plate wheels. The body material was soon changed to die cast zinc and it was refitted with cast wheels and moulded rubber tyres. Other models followed and the product line was given the name &quot;Castoys.&quot; These were the direct ancestors of Corgi Toys. 

The name &#x27;Corgi Toys&#x27; was chosen by Philip Ullmann in honour of the company&#x27;s new home, taken from the Welsh breed of dog, the Corgi, and the iconic Corgi dog logo branded the new range. The name was short and easy to remember, further aligning the range with their rival Dinky Toys. Corgi Toys also included plastic glazing, which lent the models a greater authenticity, and they carried the advertising slogan &quot;the ones with windows&quot;.

The 1956 releases were all familiar British vehicles. Six family saloon cars; Ford Consul (200/200M), Austin A50 Cambridge (201/201M), Morris Cowley (202/202M), Vauxhall Velox (203/203M), Rover 90 (204/204M), Riley Pathfinder (205/205M) and Hillman Husky (206/206M), and two sports cars; Austin-Healey 100 (300) and Triumph TR2 (301).

Initially, models were issued both in free-rolling form, and (except the larger commercial vehicles and sports cars with low-slung bodies) with friction drive motors. The Mechanical versions, as they were known, were indicated by an &#x27;M&#x27; suffix to the model number and were produced in different colour schemes. They were issued with tougher die-cast bases to support the extra weight of the motor. Mechanical versions did not sell as well as the free-rolling versions, partly due to a significantly higher purchase price, and were phased out in 1960 with Ford Thunderbird (214M) the last of the line. One particular problem that was not anticipated was that it was possible to lubricate the &quot;motor&quot; using oil through a hole in the base, but the oil tended to splatter around inside and cloud up the windows. The rigid die-case bases which were are originally limited to the &quot;M&quot; versions were retained and became the standard for Corgi toys.

==Expansion and innovation==
British cars dominated the releases at the beginning, reflecting the company&#x27;s concentration on the home market, but by 1957 new markets were being explored and the first European car to be modelled was the Citroën DS19 (210) issued in December of that year. The first American car, the Studebaker Golden Hawk (211/211M), was released in February 1958 and by the early 1960s the Corgi range was being exported widely, finding particular popularity in Europe, Australia, Canada, the United States of America and areas of southeast Asia such as Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, and gradually more foreign vehicles were included to appeal to these new markets.

Models were issued on a monthly basis and the range grew quickly to include vehicles of all types. Gradually the models became more sophisticated with the addition of such features as &#x27;Glidamatic&#x27; spring suspension and a detailed interior on the Renault Floride (222) in October 1959, and the fibre-optic style &#x27;Trans-o-Lite&#x27; illuminating lights system first seen on the Superior Air-Ground Ambulance Service on Cadillac Chassis (437) in October 1962. The early type of interior which was known as &#x27;vac-formed&#x27;, was produced by stretching a thin sheet of acetate over a mould by means of a vacuum, and lasted for three years until being replaced by the crisper, more detailed injection-moulded type first seen in the Thames &#x27;Airborne&#x27; caravan (420) in February 1962.
The Corgi design team came up with the first model with an opening feature in February 1960, the Aston Martin DB4 (218) which had an opening bonnet. Steerable front wheels, jewelled headlights and rear lights and an opening boot complete with spare wheel were added on the Bentley Continental Sports Saloon (224) in April 1961, and by October 1963 with the release of the Ghia L6.4 (241) new levels of authenticity were reached. This model featured a number of &#x27;firsts&#x27; with not only an opening bonnet, but also opening doors and boot, and a detailed interior with a rear view mirror, folding front seats, and even a model corgi dog sitting on the rear parcel shelf. At introduction, the Ghia sold for eight shillings and sixpence, and even at this relatively high price around 1.7 million were sold before being withdrawn in 1969. By contrast, only twenty five examples of the real car were completed! Another popular model was the Jaguar Mark X (#238; 1962–1967) — over 1.1 million were sold, and hardly any other model was released in as many colours.

In 1964, Mettoy introduced a range of smaller scale vehicles called Husky Toys. These retailed at a lower retail price and were available exclusively through F.W.Woolworth &amp; Co, and were designed to venture into the market dominated for many years by Lesney&#x27;s Matchbox range. 

==Corgi Classics==
In 1964 Corgi diversified into the adult collector market and released a range of highly detailed models of vintage cars called &#x27;Corgi Classics&#x27;. Marketed at a higher price point than Lesney&#x27;s Matchbox &#x27;Models of Yesteryear&#x27;, they met with mixed success. Initial releases were a 1927 Bentley finished in green (9001) or red (9002), an open 1915 Ford Model T coloured black (9011) and yellow (9012), and a version finished in blue with the hood raised (9013), a 1910 Daimler 38 finished in red (9021) and a 1911 Renault 12/16 finished in lavender (9031) or pale yellow (9032).

Two years later, a 1912 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost coloured silver (9041) was added to the range, which was updated in 1970 to feature American TV stars The Hardy Boys, discussed later in this article. A Ford Model T van in Lyons Tea livery (9014) appeared in the 1967 Corgi catalogue but was never released. The Corgi Classics range was discontinued in 1969, although the name was later revived for a range of adult collectable models in the 1980s.

==Corgi Major Toys==
Following the success of the Dinky Supertoys range of die-cast trucks, Corgi decided to launch a range of heavy commercial vehicles in October 1957 with the release of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1101) featuring a Bedford S-Type tractor unit with full glazing in keeping with the rest of the Corgi range, and the company&#x27;s first gift set including the Carrimore Car Transporter and four cars (GS1); Austin Cambridge (201), Jaguar 2.4 (208), Austin-Healey (300) and MGA (302) in time for the Christmas market in December 1957.

Early models in the new &#x27;Corgi Major&#x27; range were issued in sturdy two piece boxes featuring the blue and yellow colour scheme that had recently been adopted across the entire Corgi range, later models in the 1960s using clear fronted packaging in line with the rest of the Corgi Toys range. The Carrimore Low Loader (1100) was the next release in April 1958 which was a low loader trailer attached to the Bedford cab and was followed by the similar Machinery Carrier low loader (1104) in September 1958. In November 1958 the Euclid TC12 Bulldozer (1102) was issued. A large earth mover which was being widely used in the construction of the M1, the UK&#x27;s first motorway, the Euclid factory was only two miles from Corgi headquarters which allowed easy access to all the data required to produce a very accurate model. April 1959 saw the release of the Bedford Fuel Tanker in the red livery of &#x27;Mobilgas&#x27; (1110) and this model was revamped in pale blue and white as the Bedford Milk Tanker (1129) in May 1962, and both were later re-issued with a more modern Bedford TK cab.

The Midland Red Motor Express Coach (1120), issued in March 1960, was a model of the latest high speed coach for the motorway age fitted with a turbo-charged engine and capable of 100 mph, and a model of the pioneering SR.N1 hovercraft (1119) was released in June 1960. In November 1962 the new Bedford TK cab unit was also fitted to the existing Carrimore Car Transporter (1105) and was also included in a new Car Transporter Gift Set (GS28) in December 1963 along with four cars; Ford Consul Classic (234), Mercedes-Benz 220 SE (230), Renault Floride (222) and Fiat 2100 (232). The Ecurie Ecosse Racing Transporter (1126) issued in October 1961 was a racing car transporter custom built for the Scottish motor racing team Ecurie Ecosse, with room for three cars and an on-board workshop.

The Corgi model featured operational ramps, a sliding door revealing the workshop complete with a miniature lathe, operational steering, and was finished in authentic dark blue. Racing Transporter Set (GS16) was also released in October 1961 featuring the Ecurie Ecosse transporter along with three racing cars; Vanwall (150), BRM (156) and [Lotus XI] (151).

The Simon Snorkel Aerial Rescue Truck (1127) was issued in September 1964. This model fire engine was based on a Bedford TK chassis and featured an extendable centre-hinged arm with rescue cradle complete with fire fighter figure holding a die-cast water cannon which could be manoeuvred by means of a rotating base and wheels and gears. The model stayed in the range until being updated with a more modern Dennis cab (1126) in June 1977.

A new cab unit was introduced in September 1965. The Ford H Cab and Detachable Trailer (1137) was an American truck produced by Corgi to appeal to the lucrative US market and featured a forward tilting cab revealing a highly detailed engine, realistic moveable door mirrors and die-cast metal air horns and side ladders. The large box trailer featured sliding side doors, opening rear doors and was finished in the blue and silver &#x27;Express Services&#x27; livery. The leap in quality of this model proved that the Major range had entered a new era, and it continued to sell well until 1972. The new Ford cab was used again in April 1966 with a new version of the Carrimore Car Transporter (1138) which had been re-designed to carry up to six Corgi cars, and which also featured in Gift Set 41 along with six cars; Ford Cortina Estate (440), Rover 2000 (252), Hillman Imp (251), Mini Cooper De-Luxe (249), Austin Seven (225) and Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1966 (321). This gift set was initially only available by mail order but was finally issued in time for Christmas in December 1967.

The Holmes Wrecker Recovery Vehicle (1142) issued in May 1967 was also based on the Ford H series tractor unit, and featured twin boom die-cast recovery cranes with hooks attached to cotton lines that could be extended by winding a pair of spare wheels attached to the sides of the vehicle, and also included were two model mechanics previously seen with the &#x27;Express Services&#x27; truck. The American LaFrance Aerial Rescue Truck (1143) was added to the Major range in October 1968 and was a highly detailed model of a tiller/ladder truck (or hook and ladder) from the United States of America. It featured an extendable ladder on a rotating base complete with plastic ladder extensions and model firemen and has recently been re-issued by the modern Corgi company in a number of authentic liveries.

The Carrimore Car Transporter Mark IV using the recently introduced Scammell cab was also released in April 1969 and a gift set (GS48) featuring the new transporter and six cars; MGC GT (345), Mini Cooper Monte Carlo 1967 (339), Sunbeam Imp Monte Carlo 1967 (340), Mini Cooper S Magnifique (334), Morris Mini Minor (226) and The Saint&#x27;s Volvo P1800 (258) soon followed. By October 1970 the Carrimore Car Transporter Mark V (1146) had grown to three decks and Gift Set 20 again featured the transporter complete with six cars now fitted with Whizzwheels; Lancia Fulvia Zagato (372), Marcos 3 Litre (377), MGC GT (378), Ford Capri 3 Litre (311), The Saint&#x27;s Volvo P1800 (201) and Pontiac Firebird (343). The colour schemes applied to some cars in the Car Transporter Gift Sets were unique to models included in these sets, such as the MGC GT (345) finished in orange, and today are particularly collectable. The Scammell Handyman Ferrymasters Truck (1147) issued in December 1969, proved to be the last new application for the Scammell cab and was finished in the authentic yellow and white livery of the Ferrymasters haulage company.

The Major range continued into the 1970s but along with the Corgi Toys range suffered somewhat from the constraints on development budgets that the company was forced to make. The Mercedes-Benz Unimog and snowplough (1150) was released in February 1971 and another American cab unit was introduced in October 1971. The new Mack was coupled with a fuel tanker in the livery of &quot;Esso&quot; (1152) in October 1971 and a Transcontinental trailer (1100) in November 1971, and fitted with an updated version of the Priestman Cub Shovel now converted to become a crane in October 1972 as the Mack Priestman Crane Truck (1154).
A new Berliet cab was introduced in May 1974 as the Crane Fruehauf Discharge Dumper (1102), a large articulated aggregate carrier for use on construction sites, and the new cab was also used as the Berliet Wrecker Truck (1144) in March 1975 updating the aforementioned Holmes Wrecker, which had been in the range since 1967. The Pathfinder Airport Crash Truck (1103) released in September 1974 had won the Design Council Engineering Award for its manufacturer Chubb, and the Corgi miniature included an internal water tank allowing water to be squirted through die-cast water cannons by pumping a rubber bulb. Another new cab was introduced in April 1976: The Ford Transcontinental was designed for long range treks across the European continent and was first issued coupled to the fuel tanker previously seen with the earlier Mack cab, also in &#x27;Esso&#x27; livery (1157) or &quot;Gulf&quot; livery (1160), and, later in February 1982, in the livery of &quot;Guinness&quot; (1169).

==Circus vehicle models==
The Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Crane Truck (1121) was the first of the highly successful and much sought after range of Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus vehicles produced by Corgi Toys during the 1960s, and was issued in October 1960. It was based on a large International truck fitted with a metal crane, hook and pulley, and painted in the traditional Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus livery of red and blue, as were all the models in the range. It was followed by the Circus Animal Cage Trailer (1123) in January 1961 which featured two two-part opening doors revealing a large cage with metal bars.

These two models were later packaged together as the Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Set (GS12). An updated version of the Karrier Bantam Mobile Butcher Shop was introduced in January 1962 as the Circus Booking Office (426). The window insert of the original depicting joints of meat was replaced with a new one with circus advertising posters. In April 1962 the existing Land Rover 109 model was issued along with a trailer carrying a large cage and a model elephant as Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Land Rover and Elephant Cage on Trailer (GS19).

The Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Vehicles Set (GS23) was issued in September 1962 featuring all the Chipperfield&#x27;s models released to date, and today this is one of the most desirable gift sets issued by the company. The Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Horse Transporter (1130) was released in October 1962 featuring the new Bedford TK tractor unit and an articulated trailer with models of circus horses, and in June 1964 the Bedford TK tractor unit was adapted with a large high-sided open top &#x27;wooden&#x27; box as the Giraffe Transporter (503) complete with models of a mother and baby giraffe.

The Land Rover, which had been adapted as a &#x27;Vote For Corgi&#x27; campaigning vehicle as a tie-in with the 1964 UK General Election, was re-issued in September 1965 in the red and blue colours of Chipperfield&#x27;s as the Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Parade Vehicle (487) with a clown and chimpanzee replacing the political canvassers of the original, and a &#x27;The Circus is Here&#x27; banner across the bonnet. The Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Menagerie Transporter (1139) which was released in October 1968 featured a new Scammell Handyman cab and a flatbed articulated trailer which carried a load of three clear plastic boxes designed to represent cages, each containing models of lions, bears and tigers.

The Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Crane and Cage (1144), issued in April 1969, again featured the Scammell tractor unit but modified using the Holmes Wrecker platform with a large crane mounted on a pivoting base to the rear, and included another of the clear plastic animal cages with a model rhinoceros inside. The final model in the Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus range was released in January 1970. The Chipperfield&#x27;s Performing Poodles Pick Up (511) was an update of the earlier Kennel Club Wagon (itself an adaptation of the Chevrolet Impala first issued in 1960) and included model poodles and trainer.

There were no further circus related releases until the Jean Richard Circus Set (GS48) which was issued in November 1978. This large set included models of the new 1/36 scale Land Rover Estate and Chevrolet Van which had been updated to become a parade vehicle and mobile booking office respectively. Also included were an animal cage trailer and models of horses and an elephant and figures of a clown and a ringmaster, together with various Big Top accessories.

Another circus themed release was the Berliet tractor unit which had been adapted to become a human cannonball launcher complete with die-cast cannon attached to the rear and a human cannonball figure that could be fired from the cannon by means of depressing a button.

==Competition models==

Throughout the company&#x27;s history, Corgi Toys have been closely associated with modelling Grand Prix and Formula 1 racing cars. The first issued was the Vanwall Grand Prix car (150) issued in July 1957. Finished in green and carrying racing number 3, it was a scale model of the car driven by Stirling Moss. This was followed in December 1958 by a BRM Grand Prix car (106) also with green paintwork, and both cars featured in the Racing Car Set (GS5) from 1958, along with the Lotus XI Le Mans racing car (151) from July 1958. The Vanwall, however, had been re-coloured red.

It was followed in December 1964 by the Lotus-Climax F1 car (155). Finished in an authentic British Racing Green and carrying racing number 1, it represented Jim Clark&#x27;s 1963 world championship winning Lotus 25, and in 1967 it was joined by the Cooper-Maserati F1 car (156) painted blue. The Lotus-Climax and the Cooper-Maserati were re-engineered in 1969 to include steerable front wheels operated by moving the driver from side to side, and a high level rear wing in the style of real Formula 1 cars of the time. They were re-coloured orange in the case of the Lotus-Climax (158) and yellow in the case of the Cooper-Maserati (159). A Lotus Racing Car set (GS37) was issued in August 1966 containing the Lotus-Climax F1 car, two Lotus Elans and a Volkswagen breakdown tow truck. Another Ferrari was issued in February 1965, the Ferrari Berlinetta (314) (Ferrari 250 LM) which had competed at the 1964 Le Mans 24 Hour race, and in May 1967 another successful sports racer, the Porsche Carrera 6 (330) (Porsche 906), was released.

In 1972 Corgi worked with the newly formed Grand Prix Association to produce a series of 1/36 scale Formula 1 racing cars. The first was the Yardley McLaren M19A (151) driven by New Zealander and 1967 World Champion Denny Hulme which was followed by the Brooke Bond Oxo Surtees TS9 driven by 1964 World Champion John Surtees (150), later followed by a Surtees TS9B in the livery of Italian sponsors &#x27;Pagnossin&#x27;, driven by Andrea de Adamich (153).

These were the first models produced in the larger 1/36 scale instead of the familiar O scale preferred by Dinky and Corgi up to this date (varying between 1/43 to about 1/50 for larger vehicles). Within five years the whole Corgi range would be replaced by vehicles in 1/36 scale.

1973 saw the release of Jacky Ickx&#x27;s Ferrari 312 B2 (152) and the John Player Special Lotus 72 (154) of World Champion (1972 and 1974) Emerson Fittipaldi or Ronnie Peterson, and in 1974 the Shadow F1 car was issued in both UOP livery (155) as driven by Jackie Oliver, and as Graham Hill&#x27;s Embassy Shadow (156). Scottish multiple World Champion Jackie Stewart&#x27;s Elf Tyrrell F1 car (158) was also released along with the STP Patrick Eagle (159) driven to victory in the 1973 Indianapolis 500 by Gordon Johncock.
The final two models in the series were the Hesketh 308 F1 car (190) driven by future English World Champion James Hunt issued in 1976, and the six wheeled Tyrrell Project 34 driven by Frenchman Patrick Depailler issued in Elf livery (161) in 1977 and First National City Travellers Checks livery (162) which was released in 1978. Two Formula 1 cars were also issued in 1/18 scale, the John Player Special Lotus 72 (190) in 1974 and the Marlboro McLaren (191) in 1975.

The Proteus-Campbell Bluebird Record Car (153) was issued in September 1960 and was modelled on the vehicle with which Donald Campbell was to set a new Land Speed Record on 17 July 1964. The Corgi design team were given extensive access to the real car in order to produce their scale model, even receiving paint samples to enable them to create an exact colour match. However, a lighter blue was chosen for the model eventually. An example of the model was presented to Donald Campbell by young members of the Corgi Club.

Models following themes were released over the years. In January 1964, Corgi updated the existing Citroën DS Safari to become a promotional vehicle for the 1964 Winter Olympics (475), complete with a skier figure, four model skis and two model ski poles. Painted white and with a decal of the Olympic rings logo on the bonnet, this model then reverted to a &#x27;Corgi Ski Club&#x27; version the following year.

It was revamped again in November 1967 for the 1968 Winter Olympics (499), this time painted white with a blue roof, and with a model toboggan on the roof rack along with a figure of a tobogganist and a pair of skis and poles, and a stylish &#x27;Grenoble Olympiade 1968&#x27; decal on the bonnet. The final version introduced in 1970 was an Alpine Rescue vehicle (510), painted white with a red roof and which came complete with figures of a St Bernard dog and rescuer, and today is the rarest of the versions.

The Monte Carlo Rally, held annually in January, provided a rich source of model cars between 1964 and 1967. By following the event closely, Corgi Toys were able to issue a model of the winning car shortly after the end of the rally Often there was not even enough time to produce a unique box for the new model, which had to make do with a hastily produced sticker applied to a standard issue box for a similar model.

The 1964 winner, Paddy Hopkirk&#x27;s Mini Cooper S (317) released in February 1964, featured jewelled headlights and a rally lamp on the roof, and was finished in the BMC team colours of red with a white roof with authentic Monte Carlo Rally transfers. Three Monte Carlo Rally cars were issued in 1965, the winning Mini Cooper S of Timo Mäkinen (321) in February, finished in the same red with a white roof, and three jewelled rally lamps, and in April a Rover 2000 (322) in maroon with a white roof with two jewelled rally lamps in the grill and a Citroën DS21 (323) with four small jewelled rally lamps and finished in pale blue with a white roof complete with roof aerial.

All three of these models were available in the Monte Carlo Gift Set (GS38) also issued in April 1965; a highly prized set for today&#x27;s collector. Another Mini Cooper S in Monte Carlo Rally finish was issued the January of following year complete with two jewelled rally lamps in the grille and the signatures of the driver Timo Mäkinen and his co-driver Paul Easter printed on the roof. The model number 321 was carried over from the 1965 car. A Hillman Imp was also issued as a Monte Carlo Rally car (328), finished in blue with a white flash along the sides and two jewelled rally lamps, and was driven by an all-female team of Rosemary Smith and Valerie Domleo in the 1966 event.

1967 was the final year that Corgi issued Monte Carlo Rally cars, and the famous Mini Cooper S (339) appeared yet again in March, this time with four jewelled rally lamps in the grill, a sump guard and two spare wheels on a roof rack borrowed from the &#x27;Surfing&#x27; Mini Traveller (485) from 1965. The 1967 Monte Carlo Rally Mini Cooper S stayed in the Corgi range until 1972, spanning two different castings. Another Mini Cooper S (333) was released in February 1967 carrying the same red and white paintwork, but as campaigned in the 1967 RAC/Sun rally by Tony Fall and Mike Wood, along with another Rover 2000 (322) from the same event finished in white with a matt black bonnet. The final rally car was the Sunbeam Imp (340) issued in March 1967, which featured four jewelled rally lamps and was finished in blue with a white flash and front panel. In December 1965 a Volkswagen 1200 Beetle was issued in East African Safari finish (256). This model featured an opening boot and engine cover and steerable front wheels operated by a spare tyre on the roof of the car.

Three years later, in July 1969, Corgi issued the winning Hillman Hunter from the 1968 London to Sydney Marathon (302), complete with Take-Off Wheels, roof mounted tool box and a plastic kangaroo guard across the front of the car. This time the packaging included a model kangaroo and details of the event, and in February 1970 a model of the unique 4wd Ford Capri 3-Litre rally car (303) driven by Roger Clark was released. A model of the successful Datsun 240Z rally car in East African Safari Finish (394) was issued in October 1972 and in May 1973 the Datsun 240Z was also issued in &quot;US Rally&quot; finish (396). This, in fact, was an authentic model of John Morton&#x27;s 300 bhp BRE-Datsun 240Z which won the 1970 and 1971 SCCA class C/P championships. The Ferrari 365GTB/4 Daytona as raced at the 1973 Le Mans 24 Hours race, with JCB and Corgi sponsorship (324), was released in June 1973 along with another in white/red/blue livery inspired by a 1972 Le Mans entry (323). In July 1973 the Porsche-Audi 917/10 (397) from the Can-Am race series was issued with L&amp;M cigarette sponsorship.

In the early 1970s Corgi Toys issued a range of dragsters in response not only to the increased interest in this form of motorsport in the UK, focused on the Santa Pod Raceway in Northamptonshire, but also the attention brought to these vehicles by Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels. The first to be released was the &#x27;Quartermaster&#x27; Dragster (162) in April 1971, closely followed by the &#x27;Commuter&#x27; Dragster (161) in June. Both were models of real vehicles, and were of the &#x27;rail&#x27; dragster variety.

The first &#x27;Funny Car&#x27; dragster was the Santa Pod &quot;Gloworm&quot; Dragster (163) issued in July 1971, and which was based on the existing Ford Capri 3-Litre casting. Modifications allowed the body to be hinged from the rear, and by pressing a button secreted in the front bumper the entire body rose, by means of a spring, to reveal a roll cage and driver within and a detailed V8 engine. The next release was a figment of the Corgi design team&#x27;s imagination. The &quot;Organ Grinder&quot; Mustang Funny Car (166), which was issued in October 1971, was purely an update of the Ford Mustang (320) first seen in 1965, complete with huge rear wheels and headers resembling organ pipes fitted to the V8 engine. In December 1971 the Ison Brothers &quot;Wild Honey&quot; Dragster (164) was released which was a fully customised &#x27;gasser&#x27; based on a 1930s Austin Seven saloon. The Adams Brothers &quot;Drag-Star&quot; (165) released in February 1972 was a four engined machine produced in conjunction with designers the Adams Brothers, and the earlier &quot;Quartermaster&quot; Dragster was updated in October 1972 as the John Woolfe Radio Luxembourg 208 Dragster (170).

==Film and television models==
===1960s===
Corgi Toys introduced the first of the many film and television tie-in models that made the company famous in March 1965, with The Saint&#x27;s Volvo P1800 (258) from the British television series &quot;The Saint&quot; starring Roger Moore. This was an update of the existing Volvo P1800 model that had been issued in 1962, now finished in white and featuring The Saint&#x27;s logo on the bonnet and a model of The Saint in the drivers seat. The Corgi executives were impressed by how The Saint version sold in much larger numbers than the regular version, despite the fact that on the TV there was no Saint&#x27;s logo on the car. With the second in the range of film and TV related models Corgi revolutionised the British toy car industry.
The most famous and best selling (to date) toy car of all, James Bond&#x27;s Aston Martin DB5 (261) from the film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, was issued in October 1965. Despite the fact that the casting of the new James Bond car was based heavily on the earlier Aston Martin DB4 model from 1960, it was the special features marked out this model. There were machine guns in the front wings which popped out at the touch of a button, a bulletproof shield which popped up to protect the rear screen when the exhaust pipes were pressed, and an ejector seat which fired through a roof panel which opened by the touch of another button. The model was released in time for the 1965 Christmas market and the Corgi factory found it was unable to keep up with demand, leading to coverage in the British press of stories of toy shop shelves being cleared of this new must-have toy in minutes. The model remains in production to this day in an updated form and has gone on to sell more than seven million examples in all its various versions.

The &quot;Thrushbuster&quot; (497) was an update of an existing Oldsmobile Super 88 casting dating back to 1961, but now with models of the stars of the television series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, agents Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin, firing guns out of the windows. The two figures popped in and out of the car windows by pressing down on a model periscope protruding through the roof. Like in the case of The Saint, this owed little to realism - on the TV show the two heroes would certainly not advertize their affiliation with the logo on the bonnet.
The Christmas market was again dominated by a Corgi toy car; this time the Batmobile (267) released in October 1966. This was a George Barris customised 1955 Lincoln Futura concept car bought by Barris as a wreck from Ford Motor Company (reputedly for one dollar) and which featured heavily in the American television series &quot;Batman&quot;.

In June 1967 GS3 was issued consisting of The Batmobile towing a Batboat on a trailer, and another James Bond car soon followed – the Toyota 2000GT (336) issued in October 1967 from the film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, which fired rockets from the boot.

The previously issued 1927 Bentley was updated for a second time to tie in with the BBC television series &quot;The World of Wooster&quot; (9004) which starred Ian Carmichael and featured figures of Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves at the wheel. It was the only film and television related model issued as part of the Corgi Classics range and did not sell well. The final film and television related model for 1967 was issued in November. The crime fighting car Black Beauty (268) - a George Barris customised 1965 Imperial Crown sedan, included an operational satellite launcher inside the boot and a rocket fired from behind the grill, and was featured in the American television series &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;. Although the series was not screened in the UK until years later, the model proved to be very popular and it went on to sell over two million examples.

A new casting of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (270) was released in February 1968, this time featuring the correct DB5 taillights (instead of the DB4 taillight clusters on the 261) and authentic silver paintwork. The original had been painted gold after the Corgi design team decided that silver painted pre-production models looked as if the metal bodies were unpainted. The new model now featured tyre slashers and revolving number plates whilst retaining all the features of the original, and early examples packaged in a short lived bubble-pack are even more valuable today than the earlier 1965 release.
November 1968 saw the release of the flying car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (266) from the successful film of the same name that had been in cinemas throughout that summer. It featured plastic wings that popped out from the car&#x27;s side skirts when the hand brake was pushed and detailed miniatures of the car&#x27;s inventor, Caractacus Potts, Truly Scrumptious and the children Jeremy and Jemima. The Monkeemobile (277) issued in December was a model of the Dean Jeffries customised 1966 Pontiac GTO that featured in the American television series &quot;The Monkees&quot;. It included miniatures of band members Davy Jones, Mickey Dolenz, Peter Tork and Mike Nesmith sitting in the car.
Film and television related models continued to be issued in February 1969 with the Yellow Submarine (803) from the animated Beatles film of the same name. This model featured two hatches that lifted at the touch of buttons on the side of the craft to allow models of the Fab Four John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr to pop into view. Early examples featured a white hatch to the front and a yellow hatch to the rear in keeping with the colour scheme of the original, before both hatches were coloured red on later models. The Yellow Submarine commands high prices today among both die-cast collectors and collectors of Beatles-related memorabilia.

Corgi Toys not only produced models of automotive stars of film and television, but also models of production vehicles. A newly tooled Commer 2500 mini bus body was used for the Samuelson Mobile Camera Van (479) issued in December 1967 which included a detailed cast metal model of a Panavision film camera and plastic cameraman on a metal plinth that could be either attached to the vehicle&#x27;s roof rack or to the front or rear of the van for tracking shots. The lens of the camera was represented by a tiny jewel. In September 1968 the Renault 16 Tour De France Paramount Film Unit (GS13) was released. This gift set featured a Renault 16 car with the tailgate removed and a platform extension fixed at the rear to accommodate the Panavision film camera model and cameraman. Also included was a miniature racing cycle and cyclist.

===1970s===
The releases of film and television related models continued into the seventies, and included more James Bond models. In June 1970, the 1912 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost from the Corgi Classics range was reissued, but updated with psychedelic paintwork and featuring figures of the group from the animated series &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, another American television show which was unknown in Britain. This time the model failed to sell, making it extremely rare today. A Ford Mustang Mach 1 (391) and the &quot;Moon Buggy&quot; (802) from the film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; were issued in 1972, and the Lotus Esprit (269) in &#x27;underwater&#x27; mode from &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; in 1977.

A rocket-firing &#x27;Stromberg&#x27; Bell JetRanger helicopter (926) from the same film was added in 1978. The Space Shuttle (649) from the Bond movie &quot;Moonraker&quot; appeared in 1979 along with a &#x27;Drax&#x27; JetRanger helicopter (930) from the same film. A Citroën 2CV which James Bond drove in the film &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was issued in 1981.

As the decade progressed some of the film and television related models became less authentic due to the lack of expensive licensing deals, and more a product of the imagination of the Corgi design team. In 1973 &#x27;Dick Dastardly&#x27;s&#x27; Car (809) was issued featuring models of the characters &#x27;Dick Dastardly&#x27; and his sidekick &#x27;Muttley&#x27; from the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Wacky Races&quot;. However, this Corgi offering was a toy-like race car from the &#x27;Comics&#x27; range, and was a far cry from the famous &quot;00-zero&quot; car that &#x27;Dick Dastardly&#x27; drove in the cartoon series.

In 1978, since the Superman movie was already popular in the UK, Corgi introduced and took advantage of recently acquired licensing deal to make Corgi Toys (model no. 260,) &quot;Superman&quot; &#x27;Metropolis Buick&#x27; as a diecast 1:36 scale replica of a 1974-1975 Buick Regal (round headlights) style sedan. This toy car was a 1979 trademark of DC Comics, Inc on the package with a cartoon Superman. The vehicle was blue and white stripes with Police and had the two front doors that would open. There were four beacons and four sirens on the roof and a City of Metropolis Police Dept emblem on the front hood. The packaging was designed for the English, French, and German markets. This was a prime example of using a car product that was not shown in the movie but using another car product from television&#x27;s &quot;Kojak&quot; series, that was produced by Corgi in 1976, a blue 74 Buick Regal police car (260B1) with one beacon and a brown 74 Buick Regal detective car (290) with one beacon. That &#x27;Kojak&#x27; series drove Buick Century&#x27;s and not the upscaled Buick Regal&#x27;s that Corgi made as authentic from the show. Further confusion in the market was the same blue Buick police car as Corgi (model no. 416) &quot;Buick Century Police-Polizei&quot; with one beacon was made in 1977 that included a police officer figure. The car was either a &quot;Kojak&quot; car, then police car, and then &quot;Superman&quot; as proof of reusing the diecast without authenticate to television or movies. The Metropolis police car of Superman, was a 1976 Plymouth Fury and there were no Buick police cars in the movie.

In 1978 the &quot;U.S. Racing Buggy&quot; (167) was reissued as &#x27;The Penguinmobile&#x27;, themed around Batman&#x27;s arch-enemy The Penguin, complete with an umbrella. (259). A &#x27;Batbike&#x27; was released in 1978 featuring a figure of &#x27;Batman&#x27; sitting astride a modified motorbike which fired two rockets, along with a series of vehicles that were issued as the result of obtaining the Marvel Comics license. They were themed around Spider-Man, Captain America, Captain Marvel and The Incredible Hulk.

These included a &#x27;Spidervan&#x27; (436); a suitably decorated Chevrolet van, which had also been issued the previous year as a tie-in with the American television series &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; (434), a &quot;Daily Planet&quot; JetRanger helicopter (929), a &quot;Spiderbuggy&quot; (261); a Jeep CJ-5 with a model of &#x27;Spider-Man&#x27;s&#x27; archenemy &quot;The Green Goblin&quot; trapped in a web styled plastic bag dangling from a crane fitted at the back of the vehicle, a &quot;Spidercopter&quot; (928) and a &quot;Spiderbike&quot; (266). A similar treatment was also given to other Marvel characters including a &quot;Captain America&quot; Jetmobile (263), a &#x27;Captain Marvel&#x27; Porsche 917/10 Can-Am racer (262) and an &#x27;Incredible Hulk&#x27; Mazda pick-up (264) which featured a caged model of the &#x27;Hulk&#x27; on the flatbed of the truck.

A &quot;Superman&quot; gift set (GS21) was released featuring a &#x27;Supermobile&#x27;, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; helicopter and a Buick Regal police car, as well as a &quot;Spider-Man&quot; gift set (GS23) consisting of the &quot;Spiderbuggy&quot;, the &quot;Spidercopter&quot; and the &quot;Spidervan&quot;. Many of these later film and television related releases were not models of authentic vehicles as were the earlier issues from the 1960s, but merely existing models updated to take advantage of recently acquired licensing deals.

In May 1978 a new version of the James Bond Aston Martin DB5 (271) was issued in 1/36 scale which featured the operational gimmicks of the 1965 original. This model appears in the Corgi range to the present day. In October 1978 The Saint&#x27;s Jaguar XJS (320) was issued. This was a model of the latest Jaguar coupe as driven by Ian Ogilvy in the ATV television series &quot;The Return of the Saint&quot; and, again, was painted white and featured The Saint logo on the bonnet.

In 1980, the &#x27;Buck Rogers&#x27; Starfighter (647), from the series &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, was released, including figures of &#x27;Colonel Wilma Deering&#x27; and robot &#x27;Twiki&#x27;. A series of models featuring characters from Jim Henson&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; were also issued in 1980. These included &quot;Kermit&#x27;s&quot; car (2030), &quot;Fozzie Bear&#x27;s truck&quot; (2031), &quot;Miss Piggy&#x27;s Sports Coupe&quot; (2032) and &quot;Animal&#x27;s Percussionmobile&quot; (2033).

By the mid-1970s some of the most popular series shown on British television were American police dramas, and Corgi decided to model several of the vehicles featured in these shows. In 1976 the Buick Regal (290) from the series &quot;Kojak&quot; was issued, complete with figures of &#x27;Lieutenant Kojak&#x27; and &#x27;Detective Crocker&#x27; shooting from the rear seat, and a year later the Ford Gran Torino from &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; (292) was released also with figures of &quot;David Starsky&quot;, &quot;Ken Hutchinson&quot;, and a &quot;suspect&quot;.

In 1980, a silver Ford Capri 3.0 S (342) was issued as a tie-in with the popular British television crime drama &quot;The Professionals&quot; featuring models of &#x27;Bodie&#x27;, &#x27;Doyle&#x27; and &#x27;Cowley&#x27;, as well as a 1957 Ford Thunderbird (348) from the American show &quot;Vega$&quot; with &#x27;Dan Tanna&#x27; at the wheel. 1982 saw the release of the &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; Ferrari 308 GTS (298). Cost-cutting at the time dictated that no figure was included.

== Emergency vehicle models ==

The first emergency vehicles produced by Corgi Toys were issued as part of the launch range in July 1956, and were based on the Bedford Utilicon light commercial. It was issued in red as a &#x27;Fire Dept&#x27; vehicle (405M) and in green as an &#x27;Army Fire Service&#x27; vehicle (405), both with a tin plate ladder attached to the roof of the vehicle. These were followed in June 1958 by the company&#x27;s first police vehicle; a Riley Pathfinder patrol car (209), finished in black and with a die cast police sign fitted to the roof complete with siren and bell. In January 1959 a Jaguar 2.4 Fire Chief car (213) was added to the range, finished in red and with a nylon aerial, crest transfers on the front doors and the same cast sign as the Pathfinder but modified to read &#x27;Fire Chief&#x27;. The first American emergency vehicle to be produced by Corgi Toys was the Chevrolet Impala State Patrol car (223) introduced in December 1959. It was painted black and featured a nylon aerial and &#x27;State Patrol&#x27; stickers on the vehicle&#x27;s front doors. An updated version finished in black and white was issued in 1965.
By 1959 the M1, the UK&#x27;s first motorway, had opened to the public and this prompted the introduction of a new breed of powerful police vehicle able to carry a large payload. The Ford Zephyr Motorway Patrol Car (419) was introduced in August 1960 and was finished in white with a plastic aerial fitted to the front wing, a blue light attached to the roof, a &#x27;Police&#x27; decal on the bonnet and a vac-formed interior detailing rescue equipment in the luggage compartment and in June 1962 the Oldsmobile Super 88 County Sheriff car (237) was added to the range. Painted black and white it featured a red light fitted to the roof and &#x27;County Sheriff&#x27; stickers on the doors. This model became the company&#x27;s first million seller. The Superior Ambulance on Cadillac Chassis (437) introduced in October 1962 was from the latest generation of models and featured red and white paintwork, a working battery operated flashing light on the roof and four trans-o-lite fibre optic lights in each corner of the roof that flashed in unison with the main bulb. This model was re-issued in blue and white in 1966. In January 1963 the existing Chevrolet Impala was introduced as a Fire Chief car (439), painted red with a light on the roof, crests decals on the doors and a &#x27;Fire Chief&#x27; transfer on the bonnet, and was also updated with a red and white finish in 1966. In June 1963 the Commer Police Van (464) was released, painted blue with a battery operated flashing light on the roof, barred side windows and &#x27;County Police&#x27; transfers along the sides, and this model was also updated in 1967. An ambulance version (463) painted white was issued in February 1964.

In October 1964 a Police Dog Handler Mini van (450) was introduced painted dark blue with &#x27;Police&#x27; in white letters on the sides, a nylon aerial fitted to the front wing and came with models of the police dog handler and police Alsatian dog. The Volkswagen European Police Car (492) issued in May 1966 was finished in the green and white of the German police force, and carried &#x27;Polizei&#x27; transfers on the doors. It featured steerable front wheels operated by the blue metal &#x27;light&#x27; on the roof and two policemen sitting inside the vehicle, not to mention opening boot and rear engine cover. Another rear engined police car was introduced in May 1968, the Sunbeam Imp &#x27;Panda&#x27; car (506). It was painted black and white initially but this colour scheme was soon changed to authentic &#x27;Panda&#x27; car colours of pale blue with a white vertical centre section.

In June 1970 a Porsche 911 Targa &#x27;Polizei&#x27; car (509) fitted with Whizzwheels was released. It featured a colour scheme of white and red and was fitted with a blue light on an extension next to the door and a die-cast loud hailer on the engine cover. A rare Dutch issue of the model featured dayglo orange and white paintwork and the correct &#x27;Rijkspolitie&#x27; livery as featured on the real vehicle. The Fire Bug (395) appeared in December 1971, and was based on a GP Beach Buggy fitted with fire fighting equipment. British police vehicles were well represented with the Police &#x27;Vigilant&#x27; Range Rover (461) released in January 1972 and the Ford Cortina Police Car (402) released in August of the same year.

Both models were finished in the contemporary white with red/blue side stripes, which would have been familiar to many motorists at the time. The Range Rover came complete with a model policeman and emergency road signs, while the Cortina was also released with &#x27;Polizei&#x27; labels on the otherwise unchanged British car as an export model for the German-speaking countries.

The remaining years that the company was in existence saw police cars based on such subjects as a Porsche 924 (430) and a Renault 5 (428), both in the white and black livery of the French Police nationale, a Mercedes 240D (412) and the Porsche 924 (430) in white and green of the German &#x27;Polizei&#x27;, and a blue Buick Regal (416) which had previously seen service as &#x27;Kojak&#x27;s&#x27; car. There was also a Metropolitan Police Land Rover and Horse box (GS44) complete with a model Police horse and rider, which was also available in Royal Canadian Mounted Police finish (GS45). 1982 the Ford Escort was released as a blue and white Police &#x27;Panda&#x27; car (297). Ambulances were issued based on the Range Rover &#x27;Vigilant&#x27; (482), a Mercedes-Benz W123 &#x27;Bonna&#x27; (406) in four different liveries for Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, and a Chevrolet Superior Ambulance (405).

There appears, however, to have been a lack of fire fighting machinery released in this time, although the American LaFrance ladder truck and Simon Snorkel were still available along with the modern Chubb Pathfinder airport crash tender. Two models from this era do warrant attention. Riot Police Truck (422) released in September 1977 was a squat armoured military vehicle painted white and red with twin water cannons fitted to the rear, and perhaps reflected the turbulent times in Britain towards the end of the 1970s, and the Jaguar XJ12 Coupe which was released in December 1975 finished in the white and pale blue livery of the Coastguard (414), complete with die-cast light and twin foghorns on the roof. The model was updated as a police vehicle (429) in February 1978. In 1980 the first of the later &#x27;Corgitronics&#x27; range was introduced: the HCB-Angus Firestreak (1001) with battery-operated siren and flashing red lights, complete with two figures in silver protective clothing.

==Commercial vehicles models==

The first light commercial modelled by Corgi Toys was the Bedford CA van in &quot;Daily Express&quot; livery (403) and in &#x27;KLG Plugs&#x27; livery (403M) which was part of the July 1956 range that launched the brand. The CA van was later released in the yellow and black livery of AA Services in May 1957 (408), in the black and silver livery of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (421) in June 1960 and in the yellow and blue livery of Corgi Toys (422) in October 1960. The first large commercial vehicles in the Corgi Toys range were the Commer Dropside lorry (452) and the Commer Refrigerated van finished the livery of Walls Ice Cream (453). The same large van body was used on the ERF 88G chassis to become the Moorhouses Van (459) in March 1958. Painted red and yellow it featured paper stickers on the sides advertising Moorhouses Lemon Cheese and Raspberry jam.

The Karrier Bantam Lucozade Van (411) was introduced in August 1958 and featured a sliding plastic door, yellow paintwork and adverts for Lucozade energy drink on the side. This model was updated in May 1962 to become the Dairy Produce Van (435) now painted pale blue and white and with a &#x27;Drive Safely on Milk&#x27; advert on the side. A Volkswagen van (433) was introduced in December 1962 finished in two tone red and white along with the Volkswagen Kombi (434) which was finished in green and white paintwork. A rare promotional version of the van was produced for the Dutch department store Vroom &amp; Dreesmann. In February 1963 the basic Volkswagen van was updated with Trans-o-lite headlamps as the Volkswagen Toblerone van (441). It was painted pale blue and finished with transfers along the sides advertising Toblerone chocolate bars. In March 1964 a Volkswagen Pick Up (432) was introduced to the range which came complete with a plastic canopy, and in December 1966 the pick up was converted to become the Volkswagen Breakdown Truck (490).

In 1963 Corgi introduced the Commer Constructor Set (GS 24), which consisted of two Commer FC van chassis units and four different rear bodies – an ambulance, milk float, panel van and pick-up. It proved very popular and remained in production until 1968. These models were also available separately as part of the normal Corgi range. The Commer Holiday Camp Special bus (508) issued in August 1968 was based on the earlier Samuelson Commer Film Unit bus, and featured bright orange and white paintwork with a decal fixed on one side on the vehicle, together with a plastic representation of luggage under cover on the roof rack.

The &#x27;Mister Softee&#x27; Ice Cream Van (428) was introduced in March 1962 and was based on a Commer BF 1 ton van and which featured a plastic knob on the underside that allowed the ice cream salesman inside to be rotated. It also featured a sliding side window. In 1965 a Thames Wall&#x27;s Ice Cream Van (447) was introduced. This was a smaller vehicle based on the Thames 5 cwt van, a commercial version of the Ford Anglia, and the bodywork featured a pointed roof design and a sliding side window. The model also came with a sheet of stickers which could be applied and also included were models of an ice cream vendor and small boy. An alternative version (474) with musical chimes operated by a handle protruding from the back of the model was introduced a year later, but without the plastic figures. A Karrier Bantam-based Mobile Butchers Shop (413) was released in October 1960 and was later updated to become a Chipperfield&#x27;s Circus Booking Office (426) in January 1962 and with the addition of an opening side hatch, a detailed kitchen interior and revolving chef it was re-issued in March 1965 as Joe&#x27;s Diner Mobile Canteen (471). An export version to be sold in Belgium featured &#x27;Patates Frites&#x27; stickers on the side in place of the usual &#x27;Joe&#x27;s Diner&#x27;.

There were no further additions to the commercial vehicle range until June 1979 with the Chevrolet van, first seen the previous year, issued in the livery of Coca-Cola (437). A Ford Transit Wrecker (1140) in the livery of &#x27;Corgi 24 Hour Service&#x27; was issued in March 1981 followed by the Ford Transit Milk float (405) in February 1982 which carried the period slogan &quot;Milk&#x27;s Gotta Lotta Bottle&quot;.

==Agricultural vehicle models==
A variety of farming vehicles formed part of the Corgi Toys range for the majority of the company&#x27;s existence under Mettoy&#x27;s ownership. These models were popular with children from rural areas and today are considered highly collectable. The range was introduced in June 1959 with the Massey Ferguson 65 tractor (50) finished in the manufacturer&#x27;s familiar red and white colours. An accompanying Massey Ferguson trailer (51) was introduced at the same time, and in April 1960 an operational shovel was added to the tractor as the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor Shovel (53). The scoop could either be raised or lowered by means of one of two levers and could be tipped by means of the second lever. Both the tractor and trailer were available together as GS 7. The Massey Ferguson combine harvester (1111) was released in August 1959 as part of the Corgi Major range, which featured blades that rotated as the model was pushed along.

A new tractor was introduced in May 1961. The Fordson Power Major Tractor (56) featured steering operated by the steering wheel and was finished in Ford&#x27;s traditional blue. A plough that could be attached to the tractor (57) was issued at the same time, and the two were available together as GS18. A half track version of the Fordson was available in March 1962 as the Fordson Power Major with Roadless Half Tracks (54). The first Agricultural Gift Set (GS22) was released in September 1962 and included the combine harvester, the Fordson and Massey Ferguson tractors with a fork replacing the shovel on the Massey Ferguson for this gift set only. Also included in the set were two trailers and an example of the existing Land Rover. The Fordson Power Major Tractor was issued with a new Beast Carrier Trailer, carrying a load of four plastic calves, as GS33 in March 1965 and the Working Conveyor on F.C.Jeep (64) was released in June 1965. This was an update of the Forward Control Jeep first issued in 1959 with a new casting of a working conveyor belt assembly fitted to the flat bed and accompanied by plastic model grain sacks and farmer. The first new tractor for five years was issued in July 1966.

The Massey Ferguson 165 (66) featured steering and an &#x27;engine sound&#x27; as the model was pushed along and was finished in red and white. The conveyor belt first seen with the F.C. Jeep was updated with a trailer chassis and coupled to a second new tractor in GS47 issued in September 1966. The Ford 5000 Super Major was finished in blue and came complete with operational steering and jewelled headlights. The new Ford tractor was coupled to a Beast Carrier trailer for GS1 released in December 1966 which became the first Corgi release in the new style cellophane window box which defined the company&#x27;s packaging for the future.

The Dodge Kew Fargo Livestock Transporter (484) was issued in April 1967. This was a large animal transporter based on an American Dodge truck which featured an opening bonnet and carried a cargo of plastic pigs. The Tandem Disc Harrow Plough Trailer (71) was released in July 1967 and an updated Agricultural Gift Set (GS5) in October 1967, which featured some of the more recent releases such as the Dodge Kew Fargo and the Massey Ferguson 165 tractor with scoop. In March 1970 the Massey Ferguson 165 Tractor With Saw Attachment (73) was issued featuring a clever circular saw attachment which rotated as the model was pushed along by means of a long finely coiled spring. Next followed two versions of the Ford 5000 Super Major tractor with a fully operational side trenching scoop (74) in 1970 followed by a version with a rear trenching scoop (72) in January 1971. The next new tractor model was issued in April 1973. The Massey Ferguson MF50B (50) featured a closed cab and was finished in yellow. A version with an operational shovel (54) was released in April 1974 and was featured with a trailer carrying a load of plastic &#x27;hay&#x27; with figures sitting atop the &#x27;hay&#x27; as the latest version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS4) in July 1974. Another new tractor was added to the range in September 1976. The David Brown Tractor and Trailer Set (GS34) included the new tractor finished in white and with a closed cab and a tipping trailer. These models were also featured in another version of the Agricultural Gift Set (GS42) released in March 1978, along with models of a grain elevator and grain silo. At the same time the David Brown tractor was issued with a Danish JF combine harvester attachment (1112).

== Military vehicle models ==

Corgi Toys produced a sizeable range of military vehicles during the 1950s and early 1960s, and they proved very popular. The Thunderbird Guided Missile and Trailer (350) was issued in May 1958 followed by the Bloodhound Guided Missile and Launch Pad (1108) in October 1958. In June 1959 the Corporal Guided Missile on Launch Pad was issued, which was later featured coupled to a mobile transporter as Corporal Erector Vehicle and Missile (1113) released in October 1959. RAF vehicles included RAF Land Rover (351) issued in May 1958, which was included in Gift Set 4 along with the Bloodhound Guided Missile, and Standard Vanguard RAF Staff Car (352) which was issued in October 1958. The Decca Mobile Airfield Radar Van (1106) released in January 1959 featured a radar scanner which revolved remotely by means of a serrated wheel, and the Bedford Military Ambulance (414) was issued in January 1961.

In January 1965, in response to a request from the company&#x27;s American agent, a range of vehicles was produced in the matt green with white star livery of the US Army. These included Commer Military Ambulance (354), Commer Military Police Van (355), Volkswagen Military Personnel Carrier (356), Land Rover Weapons Carrier (357), Oldsmobile HQ Staff Car (358), Army Field Kitchen (359), International Troop Transporter (1113), Bedford Army Fuel Tanker (1134) and Heavy Equipment Transporter (1135). All were updates of existing models from both the standard Corgi range and the Corgi Major range, and sold disappointingly leading to their withdrawal at the end of 1966. This line featured in Corgi catalogues for 1965 &amp; 66.

There were no further military vehicles produced until the 1970s. A range of tanks was introduced in November 1973 with the German Tiger Tank Mk I (900) and the British Centurion Tank Mk III (901). It was expanded in 1974 with the releases of U.S. M60A1 Tank (902), the British Chieftain Tank (903), German King Tiger Tank (904), Russian SU-100 Tank Destroyer (905) and British Saladin Armoured Car (906). The Centurion Mk III tank was also included as part of Centurion Tank and Transporter (GS 10) along with a Mack articulated transporter truck.

The Bell AH-1G &#x27;HueyCobra&#x27; US Army Helicopter (920) was issued in March 1975, the German Hanomag Sd.Kfz. 251 Semi-Track Rocket Launcher (907) in July 1975 and the Sikorsky Skycrane US Army Helicopter (923) in September 1975. Military Gift Set (GS17) included the Bell Helicopter, Tiger I Tank and Saladin Armoured Car. Finally, in October 1976 the French AMX-30 Recovery Tank (908) and British Quad Gun Tractor and Field Gun (909) were issued.

== Take-Off Wheels and Whizzwheels ==
By the late sixties the British toy car market had changed with the arrival from the U.S. of Mattel&#x27;s Hot Wheels range and their associated track sets. Sales of Corgi Toys began to fall away and matters were not helped by a disastrous fire at the Swansea factory in March 1969 which destroyed a warehouse full of models awaiting delivery. Even one of the company&#x27;s cleverest innovations the Golden Jacks &#x27;Take-Off Wheels&#x27; system which first appeared in March 1968 did little to halt the slide. The authentically detailed die-cast wheels fitted to these models were unique to each model, with the exception of the Oldsmobile Toronado and the Chevrolet Camaro which shared a wheel design, and were attached to the axle by means of the &#x27;Golden Jacks&#x27; – die-cast golden metal stands, which when folded downwards both released the wheel and supported the model. Only seven models were produced with this feature, with more models like the Ferrari Dino, Lamborghini Miura and Pontiac Firebird planned but ultimately released with Whizzwheels instead.

The Mini Marcos was a fibreglass-bodied coupe produced by the specialist British sports car manufacturer Marcos and was built on the Austin/Morris Mini chassis and fitted with a highly tuned Mini engine. The Corgi model Mini Marcos GT850 (341), finished in metallic red, was the first in the series of Take-Off Wheels models and was introduced in March 1968. The Rover 2000 TC (275) issued a month later in April 1968 and finished in metallic green was a new casting despite Corgi having previously issued a model of the Rover 2000, and was fitted with a clear roof panel as featured on a Rover 2000 displayed on the Triplex stand at the 1965 Earls Court Motor Show, and a plastic spare wheel holder attached to the boot lid which was a popular period extra on the real car. A rare version finished in white with a red interior also exists.

The Oldsmobile Toronado (276) released in June 1968 was an updated version of the earlier 1967 Corgi release of the same model but re-coloured metallic red or metallic yellow, but the metallic gold coloured Chevrolet Camaro SS350 (338) issued in August 1968 was a new model of one of the latest generation &#x27;pony&#x27; cars from America. The previously mentioned 1968 London to Sydney Marathon winning Hillman Hunter rally car (302) was issued in July 1969 and was finished in the blue and white of the original. The Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow Mulliner Park Ward Coupe (273), finished in pearlescent white over grey, was issued in March 1970. A rare version of this model was released in silver over metallic blue which was used as the colour scheme for the later Whizzwheels version. The Chevrolet Corvette Stingray (300) with detachable roof panels, released in April 1970, was the last of this short-lived line. This model was available in chromed red or green finish called &#x27;Solarbrite&#x27; by Corgi and introduced with the Corgi Rockets range the previous year. Spare Take-Off Wheels were available separately in packs of twelve.

Low friction wheels known as &#x27;Whizzwheels&#x27; were introduced to keep up with the competition in September 1969 with the Ferrari 206 Dino Sports (344) finished in either red and white or yellow and black. The first incarnation (known to collectors as &#x27;Red Spots&#x27;) featured rubber tyres and brass hubs with low friction red nylon centres, which though attractive and effective, were expensive to produce and were soon replaced by plastic wheels. Although giving more &#x27;play value&#x27;, Whizzwheels models are less popular with collectors today as they take away some of the character and realism of the earlier regular wheeled models fitted with rubber tyres.

==Corgi Comics==
Corgi Toys introduced the Corgi Comics range in 1969 as a range of character based toys aimed at younger children. Noddy&#x27;s Car (801) featured figures from the Enid Blyton children&#x27;s novels of &#x27;Noddy&#x27;, &#x27;Big-Ears&#x27; and &#x27;Golly&#x27; sitting in the rumble seat. Early examples featured a model gollywog with a black painted face but after just a few months the colour was changed to grey. The model was later reissued with &#x27;Teddy&#x27; sitting in the rumble seat, perhaps in response to the fact that gollywogs had become less acceptable by the late 1960s. It was issued again in the 1970s with just &#x27;Noddy&#x27; at the wheel. Also released in December 1969 as part of the range was &#x27;Popeye&#x27;s Paddlewagon&#x27; (802) a half car – half boat featuring &#x27;Popeye&#x27;, &#x27;Olive Oyl&#x27; and &#x27;Swee&#x27;pea&#x27; from the &#x27;Popeye&#x27; cartoon series, and &#x27;Basil Brush&#x27;s car (808) featuring a model of the glove puppet fox from the popular British children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot; driving a colourful version of the 1911 Renault from the Corgi Classics range.

Also issued at the same time was a range of toys from Serge Danot&#x27;s animated television series &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;. These included the &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27; Carousel (H852), &#x27;Mr Mac Henry&#x27;s&#x27; trike (H859), the &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27; train (H851) and &#x27;Dougal&#x27;s&#x27; car (807), a modified Citroën DS featuring models of &#x27;Dougal&#x27; the dog, &#x27;Dylan&#x27; the rabbit and &#x27;Brian&#x27; the snail. Individual figures of all the characters were available, as was a &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27; Playground set (H853) that included all the models in the &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27; series as well as a large &#x27;magic garden&#x27; base that featured trees and train tracks. The models in the series were all able to run on these tracks, and would move around the &#x27;Magic Garden&#x27; at the turn of a large plastic handle. This set is now one of the most valuable of all Corgi Toys products.

== Corgi Kits, Corgi Cargoes, accessories and catalogues ==
During the early 1960s Corgi Toys issued a series of clip-together plastic kits of buildings and street furniture to complement and add further play value to their range of scale vehicles. The first release was the Batley Leofric Garage (601) with opening garage door in May 1960 followed by two street lamps (606) and AA (Automobile Association) and RAC (Royal Automobile Club) Telephone Boxes (602) in June 1960. In November 1960 Silverstone Pits (603) and Silverstone Press Box (604) were added to the range with Silverstone Club House and Timekeepers Box (605) released in March 1963 along with Circus Elephant and Cage (607). In April 1963 the Motel Chalet (611) was issued and in December 1963 a Shell/BP Service Station (608) was released, along with Shell/BP Forecourt Accessories (609) and Metropolitan Police and Public Telephone Boxes (610). A series of figures to go with Corgi Kits were released in December 1962; Racing Drivers and Mechanics (1501), Spectators (1502), Race Track Officials (1503), Press Officials (1504) and Garage Attendants (1505). The range culminated with two Gift Sets grouping together most of the releases - Shell/BP Garage Layout (GS25) and Silverstone Racing Layout (GS15) both issued in December 1963.

Designed with the intention of being used in conjunction with the Commer Platform Lorry (454), Commer Dropside Lorry (452), ERF Platform Lorry (457) and ERF Dropside Lorry (456), Corgi introduced a series of painted die-cast metal &#x27;loads&#x27; called Corgi Cargoes. They were packaged in a clear plastic blisters attached to a card featuring the Corgi dog logo, images of Corgi lorries and the range&#x27;s signature blue and yellow colour scheme. The first to be introduced in February 1960 were Plank Load (1485) and Cement Load (1488), and they were incorporated into Gift Set 11 including the ERF Dropside Lorry and Trailer in March 1960. Brick Load (1486) and Milk Churns Load (1487) followed in July 1960 and Skip and Churns (1490) in September 1960. The last in this range to be released was to be used with the Massey Ferguson 65 Tractor (50) and was a red painted cast metal platform carrying three metal milk churns which clipped to the rear of the tractor. The packaging featured an image of a tractor. Corgi Cargoes were available until 1964.

In December 1959 Corgi Toys produced packs of stickers which could be affixed to personalise Corgi models. Pack A (1460) included number plates, road fund licenses and GB plates, Pack B (1461) featured sports wheel discs and white-wall tyres, Pack C (1462) contained commercial vehicle items, Pack D (1463) included CD plates and L (learner) plates and Pack E (1464) introduced in December 1961 contained AA and RAC badges and towing plates. Today it is not uncommon to find early Corgi models with such additions still intact.

From 1956 to 1985 a catalogue was issued annually to promote the Corgi range. It was originally a small fold-out single sheet leaflet but by the late 1960s it had evolved into a 48-page colour catalogue. Corgi catalogues are notable for their illustrations and art work that are evocative of the period, and they are now collectable in their own right.

==Decline and demise==
After the success of the range during the late 1950s and 1960s, sales remained buoyant in the 1970s, and the company made its biggest profit of £3.5 million in 1978. In an attempt to keep its products contemporary Mettoy began production of the Dragon computer which was aimed at younger users. The expense of this project proved a drain on the company&#x27;s resources, and profits were hit hard. In October 1983, Corgi Toys were forced to call in the Official Receiver, just three years after the demise of Dinky Toys and one year after Lesney Products, the creators of the Matchbox brand.

==Legacy==
The Corgi story did not end in the mid-1980s, however, as a management buy-out saw the company re-formed as Corgi Toys Limited in March 1984. This company continued to produce model vehicles, but in smaller numbers than before. The workforce grew but the costs of running the factory at the Fforestfach site had become higher. Competition was now wholly in the form of products that were being manufactured overseas leading to management moving some of the moulds to China and setting up a joint venture company with a Hong Kong company called Flying Dragon.

At the same time it took on contract work producing non-toy items. In 1989 the management sold the Corgi brand to Mattel and the factory was retained under the name of Microlink Industries Ltd. The products of the Mettoy owned company continue to be prized by collectors worldwide. In recent years the internet has allowed a far wider collector-base than in the past when swapmeets and antique markets were the only places they could be found.

==Corgi Classics Limited==

A management buyout in 1995 saw the end of Mattel ownership and a new company was created, Corgi Classics Limited. On 1 May 2008, Corgi Classics was bought by the international models and collectables group Hornby.

<doc id="523336" wikidata="Q235934" url="?curid=523336" title="Lisa Stansfield">
<text>Lisa Jane Stansfield (born 11 April 1966) is an English singer, songwriter, and actress. Her career began in 1980 when she won the singing competition &quot;Search for a Star&quot;. After appearances in various television shows and releasing her first singles, Stansfield, along with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, formed Blue Zone in 1983. The band released several singles and one album, but after the success of Coldcut&#x27;s &quot;People Hold On&quot; in 1989, on which Stansfield was featured, the focus was placed on her solo career.

Stansfield&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Affection&quot; (1989) and its worldwide chart-topping lead single &quot;All Around the World&quot; were major breakthroughs in her career. She was nominated for two Grammy Awards, and &quot;Affection&quot; is her best-selling album to date. In the following years, Stansfield released &quot;Real Love&quot; (1991), &quot;So Natural&quot; (1993), and &quot;Lisa Stansfield&quot; (1997). In 1999 she appeared in her first film, &quot;Swing&quot;, and also recorded the for it. Her next albums included &quot;Face Up&quot; (2001), &quot;&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Moment&quot; (2004). Thereafter, Stansfield took a break from music and focused on her film career. In 2008, she starred in &quot;The Edge of Love&quot; and in 2014 she appeared in &quot;Northern Soul&quot;.

Stansfield released her seventh album &quot;Seven&quot; on 31 January 2014. Its lead single &quot;Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; was digitally released on 16 October 2013. She promoted the album with the European Seven Tour in 2013 and 2014. Her most recent album &quot;Deeper&quot; was released on 6 April 2018. In June 2018, following a string of sold-out tour dates in Europe, Stansfield announced her North American Tour, which began in October 2018.

Stansfield has won numerous awards, including three Brit Awards, two Ivor Novello Awards, a Billboard Music Award, World Music Award, ASCAP Award, Women&#x27;s World Award, Silver Clef Award and two DMC Awards. She has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including five million of &quot;Affection&quot;. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked her as the 46th-most-successful dance artist of all time.

==Early life and career beginnings==
Stansfield was born at the Crumpsall Hospital in Manchester, England. Her parents are Marion (d. 27 September 2013) and Keith Stansfield, and she has two sisters, Karen and Suzanne. Her family moved to Heywood in 1976, then to Rochdale in 1977. Stansfield attended Siddal Moor School (Heywood), Redbrook Middle School where she won the annual talent contest, and Oulder Hill Community School (both in Rochdale). She grew up listening to soul music, and stated that her mother&#x27;s affinity for records by Diana Ross and the Supremes was her first musical influence, Stansfield citing Marvin Gaye, Chic and Barry White as other primary musical influences.

In 1980, Stansfield won the &quot;Search for a Star&quot; singing competition, held at the Talk of the Town nightclub, and in 1981 her first single &quot;Your Alibis&quot; was released by Devil Records. In 1982, she appeared on the television show &quot;Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment&quot; on Granada Television. At the same time, Stansfield signed a recording contract with Polydor Records.

In 1983, Johnnie Hamp produced for Granada Television a documentary directed by Pete Walker, &quot;Born in the Sixties: Lisa Stansfield&quot;. It was a profile of the aspiring singer, and it included her comments and those of her mother and sisters, and some songs sung by Stansfield. Also in 1983, she co-hosted the children&#x27;s television music programme &quot;Razzamatazz&quot; and appeared on another children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Krankies Klub&quot;. Between 1982 and 1983, Stansfield released her three new wave pop singles on Polydor: &quot;The Only Way&quot;, &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;, and &quot;I Got a Feeling&quot;. Her early recordings were collected and released on the compilation album &quot;In Session&quot; in September 1996.

==Music career==
===1984–1988: Blue Zone===
In 1984, Stansfield and former schoolmates, Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, after having worked together on a school musical production (&quot;Schizophrenia&quot; (1982), directed by drama teacher Jeanette Dawson and described briefly by Alastair on the Manchester Digital Music Archive in 2007), began to collaborate musically and, in 1986, formed the band Blue Zone. They wrote some songs, produced a demo, and took it around to record labels. The small indie label Rockin&#x27; Horse Records signed them in 1985, and one year later the label was bought up by Arista Records. After releasing their first two singles in 1986, &quot;Love Will Wait&quot; and &quot;Finest Thing&quot;, Arista issued &quot;On Fire&quot; in October 1987. Just as the single was climbing the charts (number ninety-nine in the United Kingdom), it was withdrawn by the record company in the wake of the King&#x27;s Cross fire. The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Thinking About His Baby,&quot; was released in January 1988 and reached number seventy-nine in the UK. Its B-side, &quot;Big Thing,&quot; became popular on the radio and in the clubs.

In July 1988, &quot;Jackie&quot; was issued as a single outside the UK, reaching number thirty-seven on the Hot Dance Club Songs and number fifty-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. The release date for Blue Zone&#x27;s album &quot;Big Thing&quot;, which was recorded in 1987, was pushed back many times by the record label. Finally, it was released outside the UK in November 1988 without any further promotion. The album included songs written by Blue Zone, except for &quot;Jackie,&quot; which was written by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. The album was produced by Paul Staveley O&#x27;Duffy, except for the track &quot;Perfect Crime,&quot; which was produced by Blue Zone. Ric Wake also co-produced &quot;Jackie&quot; and &quot;Perfect Crime.&quot;

===1989–1990: &quot;Affection&quot;===
In early 1989, Stansfield co-wrote and recorded &quot;People Hold On&quot; for Coldcut&#x27;s album &quot;What&#x27;s That Noise?&quot; The single was released in March 1989, and reached number six on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States and number eleven in the United Kingdom. On the strength of this hit, Arista Records signed Stansfield to a solo deal. Her debut album &quot;Affection&quot; was released on 20 November 1989. Stansfield co-wrote all songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris. Devaney and Morris also produced the album, except for &quot;This Is the Right Time,&quot; which was produced by Coldcut. &quot;Affection&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics, and was commercially successful. It reached the top ten on charts around the world, including number one in Austria and Italy, number two in the UK, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, number three in Belgium, number five in New Zealand, number six in the Netherlands and Norway, and number seven in Australia and Canada. In the U.S., it peaked at number five on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album has sold over five million copies worldwide and was certified 3× Platinum in the UK, Platinum in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, and Gold in France, Finland and Austria.

&quot;Affection&quot; includes Stansfield&#x27;s biggest hit and signature song, &quot;All Around the World&quot;. The track reached number one in many countries, including the UK, Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway and Spain. In the U.S., &quot;All Around the World&quot; peaked at number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs and Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The single was certified Platinum in the U.S. for selling over one million copies, and Gold in many other countries, including the UK, Germany, Australia, Sweden and Austria. In the UK, other singles from the album reached numbers ten (&quot;Live Together&quot;), thirteen (&quot;This Is the Right Time&quot;) and twenty-five (&quot;What Did I Do to You?&quot;) on the chart. In the U.S., &quot;You Can&#x27;t Deny It&quot; peaked at number one on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, number two on Hot Dance Club Songs, and number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;This Is the Right Time&quot; reached number one on Hot Dance Club Songs, number thirteen on Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, and number twenty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Stansfield also toured Europe and North America in 1990 in support of the album, and eventually released the &quot;Live! All Around the World&quot; home video. Thanks to &quot;Affection&quot; and &quot;All Around the World,&quot; she received many awards, including the Brit Award, the Billboard Music Award, the World Music Award, the ASCAP Award, Ivor Novello Awards, Silver Clef Awards and DMC Awards. Stansfield was also nominated for two Grammy Awards in the Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance categories. Shortly after her success, she made two charity recordings. In December 1989, Stansfield was a part of Band-Aid II, a charity supergroup founded to raise money for anti-poverty efforts in Ethiopia, recording &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?,&quot; which topped the UK Singles Chart for three weeks. Later, she covered &quot;Down in the Depths&quot; for the AIDS charity compilation &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot;, released in September 1990, and also filmed a music video for it.

===1991–1992: &quot;Real Love&quot;===
In 1991, Stansfield recorded her second studio album &quot;Real Love&quot;, and released it on 11 November 1991. She co-wrote all the songs with Ian Devaney and Andy Morris, who also produced the album. &quot;Real Love&quot; received positive reviews from music critics and reached the top ten on the charts in various countries, including number three in the United Kingdom, number five in the Netherlands, number nine in Germany, and number ten in Belgium. In the United States, it peaked at number six on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number forty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Real Love&quot; was certified 2× Platinum in the UK and Gold in the U.S., Canada, Germany, and Switzerland. The first single &quot;Change&quot; became a hit, peaking within the top ten in Italy, Belgium, Spain, Netherlands, Canada and the UK. In the U.S., it reached number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs, number twelve on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and number twenty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The second single from the &quot;Real Love&quot; album, &quot;All Woman,&quot; peaked inside the top forty in various European countries, including number twenty in the UK. It was successful on the U.S. Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, reaching number one in April 1992. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;All Woman&quot; reached number fifty-six. The next two singles released in Europe included &quot;Time to Make You Mine&quot; and &quot;Set Your Loving Free,&quot; which peaked at numbers fourteen and twenty-eight in the UK. The last U.S. single, &quot;A Little More Love,&quot; reached number thirty on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs. In 1992, Stansfield toured Europe, Asia and the United States, and released the &quot;Live at Wembley&quot; home video. In late 1992 she co-wrote and recorded &quot;Someday (I&#x27;m Coming Back)&quot; for the successful &quot;The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album&quot;. The song was released as a single in Europe in December 1992, after &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; by Whitney Houston, and reached top ten in the UK. She also wrote a song for Dionne Warwick, &quot;Friends Can Be Lovers,&quot; which was produced by Ian and Andy along with another song written by Diane Warren, &quot;Much Too Much.&quot; Lisa sang background vocals on both tracks, which appear on the 1993 Dionne Warwick album &quot;Friends Can Be Lovers&quot;.

===1993–1996: &quot;So Natural&quot;===
In April 1993, George Michael released his charity EP, &quot;Five Live&quot;. It included &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives,&quot; recorded with Stansfield and Queen during The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in April 1992. &quot;Five Live&quot; was a success, reaching number one in the United Kingdom for three weeks. During the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, which was also released on VHS, Stansfield performed &quot;I Want to Break Free,&quot; as well. In early 1993 she co-wrote and recorded &quot;In All the Right Places,&quot; the theme song from the film &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, starring Robert Redford and Demi Moore. The single was issued in May 1993, and reached number eight in the UK and Ireland. It was later included on Stansfield&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;So Natural&quot;, released on 8 November 1993.

&quot;So Natural&quot; garnered positive reviews from music critics, and performed moderately on the charts, reaching number six in the UK and receiving Platinum certification. It also peaked within the top forty in Italy, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Netherlands. The album was promoted by two singles, &quot;So Natural&quot; and &quot;Little Bit of Heaven,&quot; which reached numbers fifteen and thirty-two in the UK. &quot;So Natural&quot; was not released in North America. In 1994, Stansfield toured Japan and the UK. In late 1994 she released two singles in the United States: &quot;Make It Right&quot; from the &quot;Beverly Hills 90210: The College Years&quot; soundtrack, and &quot;Dream Away&quot; (duet with Babyface) from the film &quot;The Pagemaster&quot;. Stansfield also recorded the following cover songs: &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; for &quot;No Prima Donna: The Songs of Van Morrison&quot; (1994), &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot; for &quot;The Glory of Gershwin&quot; (1994), &quot;Just to Keep You Satisfied&quot; for &quot;Inner City Blues: The Music of Marvin Gaye&quot; (1995), and &quot;Take Me Away&quot; (duet with Aska) for &quot;One Voice: The Songs of Chage &amp; Aska&quot; (1996).

===1997–2000: &quot;Lisa Stansfield&quot;===
Her self-titled fourth studio album &quot;Lisa Stansfield&quot; was released on 21 March 1997. It garnered favourable reviews from music critics, and was commercially successful, reaching number two in the United Kingdom, number six in Belgium, and peaked inside the top forty in many European countries and Japan. It also received Gold certification in the UK, Spain, and Switzerland. In the United States the album peaked at number thirty on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, and fifty-five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Singles released in Europe included &quot;People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes),&quot; &quot;The Real Thing,&quot; &quot;Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,&quot; and &quot;The Line.&quot; They all entered the UK Singles Chart reaching numbers four, nine, twenty-five and sixty-four, respectively.

In the U.S., &quot;Never, Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; peaked at number seventy-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and at number one on the Billboard Top Dance Tracks. The album also spawned four number-one singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot Dance Club Songs: &quot;People Hold On (The Bootleg Mixes),&quot; &quot;Never, Never Gonna Give You Up,&quot; &quot;Never Gonna Fall,&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Leavin&#x27;.&quot; This success prompted Arista Records to release &quot;The Remix Album&quot; in June 1998. Stansfield toured South America, the U.S., and Europe in 1997 and 1998 to promote the album.

In July 1999, Stansfield&#x27;s duet with Barry White &quot;The Longer We Make Love&quot; was released as a single from his album &quot;Staying Power&quot;.

In late 2000 she recorded two cover songs: &quot;You Keep Me Hangin&#x27; On&quot; for the &quot;Motown Mania&quot; album (released in December 2000), and &quot;Somewhere My Baby Waits for Me&quot; for &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; soundtrack (released in January 2001).

===2001–2003: &quot;Face Up&quot; and &quot;Biography: The Greatest Hits&quot;===
Stansfield released her fifth studio album &quot;Face Up&quot; on 20 June 2001. It featured funk and soul songs, and also the adventurous usage of 2-step garage beats on the lead single &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Call It Love.&quot; However, &quot;Face Up&quot; performed somewhat unsuccessfully on the charts, reaching top forty in only few countries, including Switzerland, Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. It wasn&#x27;t released in North America. Stansfield toured Europe in 2001 and 2002.

On 3 February 2003, Stansfield released her first greatest-hits album, &quot;&quot;. It reached number three in the United Kingdom (where it was certified Gold), number four in Italy, and also charted in other European countries. It was simultaneously issued on DVD. Stansfield toured Europe in March and April 2003 to promote the compilation. In June 2003, Arista Records remastered all of her studio albums and re-released them separately with bonus tracks. &quot;The Complete Collection&quot;, a six-CD box set, was issued simultaneously. In November 2003, she appeared on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot;, singing &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the World on a String.&quot;

===2004–2012: &quot;The Moment&quot;===
In 2004, Stansfield recorded &quot;Too Hot&quot; for Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s &quot;The Hits: Reloaded&quot; (released in April 2004), and &quot;Breath In, Breath Out&quot; (duet with Lââm) for her album titled simply &quot;Lââm&quot; (released in September 2004). After fulfilling her obligation to Arista Records, Stansfield signed with ZTT Records. The Grammy Award-winning Trevor Horn produced her next pop-oriented album, &quot;The Moment&quot;, which was released in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2004. It was well received by music critics, but failed commercially in the UK peaking at number fifty-seven. In February 2005, &quot;The Moment&quot; was issued in the rest of Europe by Edel, achieving moderate success on the charts in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, reaching numbers fifteen, sixteen and twenty-two, respectively. It was also certified Gold in Germany. The album was promoted mainly by two singles: &quot;Treat Me Like a Woman&quot; and &quot;If I Hadn&#x27;t Got You.&quot; She also toured Europe in June and July 2005.

===2013–2016: &quot;Seven&quot;===
Between May and July 2013, Stansfield toured Europe singing her greatest hits. On 13 August 2013, she announced that her seventh studio album titled simply &quot;Seven&quot; would be released on 21 October 2013. In October 2013, it was announced that the release date of the album had been pushed back to 31 January 2014 in Germany, and 10 February 2014 in the United Kingdom. The first single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Dance,&quot; premiered on Ken Bruce&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 show on 14 August 2013, and was digitally released on 16 October 2013.

&quot;Seven&quot;, which was produced and written in the United Kingdom by Stansfield and Ian Devaney, features the tracks &quot;Can&#x27;t Dance,&quot; &quot;The Rain,&quot; &quot;Stupid Heart,&quot; &quot;Conversation,&quot; &quot;The Crown,&quot; &quot;So Be It,&quot; and &quot;Picket Fence.&quot; Recorded in both Los Angeles and Manchester, Stansfield collaborated with John Robinson and Grammy Award-winning orchestrator Jerry Hey, both integral to the creation of Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Bad&quot; albums. &quot;Carry On&quot; was chosen as the second single, and its music video premiered on 31 January 2014. The album peaked at number 13 in the UK. A deluxe edition featuring bonus material was also released. Stansfield toured the United Kingdom in November 2013, and her Seven Tour continued in Europe in May and June 2014. The tour ended with a series of concerts in the United Kingdom in September 2014 and other European countries in October and November 2014. In October 2014, &quot;Seven&quot; was re-released as &quot;Seven+&quot; including one new song and fifteen remixes.

In November 2014, Edsel Records released &quot;The Collection 1989–2003&quot;, a thirteen-CD and five-DVD box set, with five of Stansfield&#x27;s studio albums and many rare additional tracks, remixes, promo videos, live concert footage, and new interviews.

===2017–2021: &quot;Deeper&quot; and touring===
In October 2017, Stansfield announced her new album &quot;Deeper&quot;, and a European tour. It was released on 6 April 2018. In the UK, &quot;Deeper&quot; reached number 15 on the UK Albums Chart, while the single &quot;Everything&quot; reached number one on the Soul Chart. In the U.S., the single &quot;Never Ever&quot; reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance chart. This marked her first appearance on that chart in 20 years, after &quot;I&#x27;m Leavin&#x27;&quot; topped the chart in 1998.

In June 2018, following a string of tour dates in Europe, Stansfield announced her North American Tour to begin in October. Her first in North America in two decades, the tour began on 9 October in Toronto and included stops in Montreal, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, and more, before concluding in San Francisco on 26 October. In October 2019 Stansfield embarked on &#x27;Affection 30th Anniversary Tour&#x27; celebrating 30 years of her debut album. In November of that year the album was reissued on Vinyl.

Stansfield was a special guest for Simply Red on their Summer Tour on 6 July 2021.

==Acting career==
In May 1999, Stansfield made her film debut. She played Joan Woodcock in the Nick Mead-directed movie &quot;Swing&quot;, also starring Hugo Speer, and recorded songs for the soundtrack. The album, full of jazz and swing tracks, was released on 10 May 1999. &quot;&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, and peaked at number six on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Jazz Albums chart.

In February 2002, she made her stage debut in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; at the Arts Theatre in the West End of London, together with Anita Dobson and Cecilia Noble. Stansfield played herself in the comedy series &quot;Monkey Trousers&quot; in mid-2005. In late 2006 she appeared in the drama series &quot;Goldplated&quot;, playing Trinny Jamieson.

In September 2007, Stansfield appeared in another television series, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot;. She played Mary Durrant in the episode titled &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot;. Stansfield dubbed one of the characters (Millie, an elf) for the English version of the Finnish animated film &quot;Quest for a Heart&quot;, released in December 2007. She also recorded the title song, written by Charlie Mole and Lee Hall. Stansfield joined the cast of the 2008 film &quot;The Edge of Love&quot;, directed by John Maybury, playing the role of Ruth Williams.

In 2009, she starred in the Nick Mead-directed documentary &quot;Dean Street Shuffle&quot; playing herself. In 2012, she performed a role in Elaine Constantine&#x27;s film &quot;Northern Soul&quot;. Set in 1974, it is an independent docudrama about the social phenomenon and generation of the northern soul music and dance movement, and was released in 2014.

== Personal life ==
In 1987, Stansfield married Italian designer Augusto Grassi, whom she had met during a holiday in Tunisia. A ceremony was held in the Sacred Heart Church in Rochdale. The couple moved to Zagarolo, Italy, but their marriage lasted only four months. Following the end of the marriage, Stansfield returned to Britain. After many years of friendship and engagement, she and Ian Devaney married on 25 July 1998. The minimalist ceremony was held in Washington Square Park in New York City, and the only guests were her parents and his mother.

In 1998, Stansfield was named in a list of the biggest private financial donors to the Labour Party.

In 2008, Stansfield sold her six-bedroom Victorian house &quot;Mount Henry&quot; on Torca Road in Dalkey, Ireland, for €6 million to Yorkshire business tycoon Ed Clark.

<doc id="523337" wikidata="Q221438" url="?curid=523337" title="Rhumba">
<text>Rhumba, also known as ballroom rumba, is a genre of ballroom music and dance that appeared in the East Coast of the United States during the 1930s. It combined American big band music with Afro-Cuban rhythms, primarily the son cubano, but also conga and rumba. Although taking its name from the latter, ballroom rumba differs completely from Cuban rumba in both its music and its dance. Hence, authors prefer the Americanized spelling of the word (&quot;rhumba&quot;) to distinguish between them.

== Music==

Although the term &quot;rhumba&quot; began to be used by American record companies to label all kinds of Latin music between 1913 and 1915, the history of rhumba as a specific form of ballroom music can be traced back to May 1930, when Don Azpiazú and his Havana Casino Orchestra recorded their song &quot;El manisero&quot; (The Peanut Vendor) in New York City. This single, released four months later by Victor, became a hit, becoming the first Latin song to sell 1 million copies in the United States. The song, composed by Moisés Simons, is a son-pregón arranged, in this case, for Azpiazú&#x27;s big band featuring three saxophones, two cornets, banjo, guitar, piano, violin, bass, and trap drums. With vocals by Antonio Machín and a trumpet solo (the first one in the recorded history of Cuban music) by Remberto Lara, the recording, arranged by saxophonist Alfredo Brito, attempted to adapt the Cuban son to the style of ballroom music prevalent at the time in the East Coast.

Soon, Azpiazú&#x27;s style was followed by other Cuban artists such as Armando Oréfiche and the Lecuona Cuban Boys, who had extensive international tours in the 1930s. Their style has been often described as ballroom conga, since they used to borrow conga rhythms in songs such as &quot;Para Vigo me voy&quot;. Among their numerous hits were boleros and &quot;canciones&quot; such as &quot;Amapola&quot; and &quot;Siboney&quot;. This music movement, which also included many American big bands that covered Latin standards, was dubbed the rhumba craze. Notable bandleaders of the rhumba craze include Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, Nathaniel Shilkret, Leo Reisman and Enric Madriguera. Rhumba was also incorporated into classical music, as exemplified by symphonic pieces by composers such as George Gershwin, Harl McDonald and Morton Gould.

The kind of rhumba introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s was characterized by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom rumba, which was developed as a dance in the 1940s and 1950s, when the original music movement had died down. Nonetheless, the rhumba craze would be the first of three Latin music crazes in the first half of the 20th century, together with the mambo craze and the cha-cha-cha craze.

==Dance==
Two variations of rhumba with opposing step patterns are danced around the world. American style rumba was imported to America by band directors like Emil Coleman and Don Aspiazú between 1913 and 1935. The film &quot;Rumba&quot;, released in 1935, brought the style to the attention of the general public. American style rhumba is taught in a box step, known for its slow-quick-quick pattern danced on the 1, 3, and 4 beats of 4-beat music. International style rhumba was developed in Europe by Monsieur Pierre after he compared the established American style with contemporary Cuban dancers. International style is taught in a quick-quick-slow pattern danced on the 2, 3, and 4 beats of 4 beat music, similar in step and motion to the cha-cha-cha. Both styles were canonized in 1955.

===International style===
Rhumba is one of the ballroom dances which occurs in social dance and in international competitions. Of the five competitive international Latin dances (pasodoble, samba, cha-cha-cha, jive, and rumba), it is the slowest. This ballroom rumba was derived from a Cuban rhythm and dance called the bolero-son; the international style was derived from studies of dance in Cuba in the pre-revolutionary period.

The modern international style of dancing the rumba derives from studies made by dance teacher Monsieur Pierre (Pierre Zurcher-Margolle), who partnered Doris Lavelle. Pierre, then from London, visited Cuba in 1947, 1951, and 1953 to find out how and what Cubans were dancing at the time.

The international ballroom rumba is a slower dance of about 120 beats per minute which corresponds, both in music and in dance, to what the Cubans of an older generation called the bolero-son. It is easy to see why, for ease of reference and for marketing, rhumba is a better name, however inaccurate; it is the same kind of reason that led later on to the use of salsa as an overall term for popular music of Cuban origin.

All social dances in Cuba involve a hip-sway over the standing leg and, though this is scarcely noticeable in fast salsa, it is more pronounced in the slow ballroom rumba. In general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced generally without any rise and fall. This style is authentic, as is the use of free arms in various figures. The basic figures derive from dance moves observed in Havana in the pre-revolutionary period, and have developed their own life since then. Competition figures are often complex, and this is where competition dance separates from social dance. Details can be obtained from the syllabuses of dance teaching organizations and from standard texts.

===American style===
There is also a variant, commonly danced in the United States, with box-like basic figures.

<text>The Bristol Type 188 is a supersonic research aircraft designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Bristol Aeroplane Company. It was nicknamed the &quot;Flaming Pencil&quot; in reference to its length and relatively slender cross-section as well as its intended purpose.

The Type 188 was developed as part of supporting research efforts for the Avro 730, a later-cancelled bomber capable of Mach 3 flight. Its purpose was to explore high-speed, high-temperature flights; for the latter purpose, it made use of unconventional materials, such as large quantities of stainless steel, as well as the incorporation of an active refrigeration system. To work with this material, relatively exotic puddle welding fabrication techniques were employed along with extensive technical support from external companies. As part of its intended test programme, the Type 188 was designed with flexible engine installations that allowed for the fitting of different air intakes, engines, and propelling nozzles. It was also furnished with extensive electronic sensors, data recording, and telemetry apparatus. A total of three aircraft were constructed a single static test frame along with two (constructor numbers &quot;13518&quot; and &quot;13519&quot;) flight-capable aircraft; various scale models were also produced.

During May 1960, the first airframe was delivered to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough. The maiden flight of the Type 188 occurred on 14 April 1962. Flight testing encountered numerous problems, including the excessive fuel consumption of the De Havilland Gyron Junior engines used, which did not permit the aircraft to fly at high speeds long enough to evaluate the &quot;thermal soaking&quot; of the airframe, one of the main research areas of the project. Across 51 flights, the Type 188 attained a maximum speed of Mach 1.88 (1,440 mph; 2,300 km/h) at 36,000 ft (11,000 m).

During early 1964, it was announced that all activity involving the Type 188 was to be terminated. The project had cost £20 million by the end of the programme, making it the most expensive research aircraft ever developed in Britain at that time. The technical data and knowledge garnered from the Type 188 was put to use in other British high-speed aerospace efforts, most notably the development of Concorde supersonic transport, as well as the Bristol (later Rolls-Royce) Olympus 593 powerplant, which powered both Concorde and the BAC TSR-2 bomber. During the late 1960s, it had been intended for both of the Type 188 fuselages to be used as targets for gunnery trials at the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness, Essex; however, &quot;XF926&quot; was subsequently transported to RAF Cosford, initially to act as instructional airframe 8368M, it has since been preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire.

==Design and development==
The Bristol Type 188 had its genesis in Operational Requirement 330, which sought a high speed (Mach 3) reconnaissance aircraft, which eventually developed into the Avro 730. Air Ministry officials recognised that, as the Avro 730 was expected to operate at high speeds for extended periods of time, more data was needed on high speed operations; to fulfil this need, the follow-on &quot;Operational Requirement ER.134T&quot; was issued in February 1953; it called for a flying testbed capable of attaining speeds in excess of Mach 2. This aircraft was expected to run at these speeds for extended periods of time, allowing it to study kinetic heating effects on such an aircraft. Furthermore, it was also expected to operate for a considerable amount of time with a skin temperature around 300 Celsius.

Several of Britain&#x27;s aircraft manufacturers took interest in this relatively advanced specification, Bristol Aircraft being specifically invited to tendered by ministry officials. The company&#x27;s design team opted to produce a clean sheet aircraft design, which was assigned the internal designation of &quot;Type 188&quot;. The submitted design was somewhat vague and even speculative in several aspects, the aircraft&#x27;s layout was not firmly decided upon until as late as 1955. Nevertheless, following a competitive review of submissions, the associated contract &quot;6/Acft/10144&quot; was awarded to Bristol during February 1953.

The advanced nature of the aircraft meant that new construction methods had to be developed. Several materials were considered for construction and two specialist grades of steel were selected: a titanium-stabilized 18-8 austenitic steel and a 12%-Cr steel used in gas turbines (Firth-Vickers &quot;Rex 448&quot;). These had to be manufactured to better tolerances in sufficient quantities for construction to start. The 12% chromium stainless steel with a honeycomb centre was used for the construction of the outer skin, to which no paint was applied. However, simply procuring sufficient amounts of stainless steel sheeting was a challenge, only compounded by factors such as the desired strength and uniformity.

While traditional riveting was considered to be a potential construction method, however, this posed substantially difficulties as every rivet, bolts, and screws used would have had to be specially manufactured out of compatible materials to ensure the necessary tolerances were met. Instead, a relatively cutting-edge technique of arc welding using an argon gas shield, known as puddle welding, was used. Another British aircraft manufacturer, the W. G. Armstrong Whitworth company, provided substantial technical help and support to Bristol during this period; they had also explored the use of puddle welding for advanced aerospace purposes. Armstrong Whitworth produced major sections of the airframe as a subcontractor. North American Aviation used the same methods of argon welding of stainless steel honeycomb sheet metal for the XB-70 Valkyrie bomber.

A fused-quartz windscreen and canopy and cockpit refrigeration system were designed and fitted, but were never tested in the environment for which they had been designed. The pilot was provisioned with a conventional ejector seat. All of the flight controls, along with elements such as the undercarriage and four-part air brakes, were hydraulically powered. The main undercarriage elements retracted inwards to lie vertically within the fuselage aft of the main spar, while the forward undercarriage retracted forwards into a space directly aft of the cockpit. The majority of the oval-shaped fuselage&#x27;s internal volume was occupied by the fuel tanks; a large compartment forward of the wing housed the suite of electronic recording and telemetry apparatus along with elements of the refrigeration system.

Amongst the various stipulations of the specification was the requirement of engine installations which permitted the fitting of different air intakes, engines and propelling nozzles. The Type 188 was originally intended to be powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Avon engines, however, these were substituted for a pair of De Havilland Gyron Junior engines (each of which was half a ton lighter) in June 1957. This change of engines necessitated some configuration changes, including the mounting of the engines further forwards along with elongated nacelles and jet pipes. The Gyron Junior was then under development for the Saunders-Roe SR.177 supersonic interceptor and incorporated a fully variable reheat arrangement, which achieved a smooth variation in thrust between dry and full reheat, so being one of the first engines in the world to give continuous variation in thrust from idle to max reheat. This choice of powerplant resulted in the Type 188 having a typical endurance of only 25 minutes, not long enough to conduct the high-speed research tests that were required of it. Chief Test Pilot Godfrey L. Auty reported that while the Type 188 transitioned smoothly from subsonic to supersonic flight, the Gyron Junior engines were prone to surging beyond that speed, causing the aircraft to pitch and yaw.

In order to solve the aerodynamic and flutter problems identified, a large number of scale models were produced and tested. Some of these models were mounted on converted rocket boosters and used to conduct free-flight investigations, multiple such launches were conducted from RAE Aberporth. As a result of these tests, along with wind tunnel testing, various aerodynamic refinements and alterations were made to the Type 188&#x27;s design. As a result, a largely rectangular wing plan was adopted between the engine nacelles alongside horn-balanced ailerons on the compact outer wings; the all-moving tailplane was also raised to the top of the fin while the chord was also extended to accommodate single-engine failure during take-off.

It was ultimately decided that there would be three aircraft built, one being a static test frame while the other two (constructor numbers &quot;13518&quot; and &quot;13519&quot;) would be used for flight testing. On 4 January 1954, under contract number &quot;KC/2M/04/CB.42(b)&quot;, the serial numbers &quot;XF923&quot; and &quot;XF926&quot; were given to the two aircraft. To support the development of the Avro 730 Mach 3 reconnaissance bomber, another three aircraft were ordered (Serial Numbers &quot;XK429&quot;, &quot;XK434&quot; and &quot;XK436&quot;). However, this follow-up order would be eventually cancelled shortly after the Avro 730 programme was itself terminated during 1957 as part of that year&#x27;s review of defence spending. Despite this, the Type 188 project was continued for the time being as a high speed research aircraft.

==Operational history==
During May 1960, the first airframe was delivered to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, where it underwent a series of structural tests, both heated and unheated, before it was transferred to RAE Bedford. On 26 April 1961, &quot;XF923&quot; undertook the first taxiing trials, after which it was promptly put through extensive pre-flight testing. Due to problems encountered with the initial design of the intake, the maiden flight of the Type 188 did not take place until 14 April 1962. &quot;XF923&quot; was intended to remain with Bristol for its initial flights and evaluation before turning it over to the MoA. &quot;XF926&quot; had its first flight, powered by &quot;XF923&quot;s engines, on 26 April 1963; &quot;XF926&quot; was given over to RAE Bedford for its flying programme.

Across 51 flights, the Type 188 reached a top speed of Mach 1.88 (1,440 mph; 2,300 km/h) at 36,000 ft (11,000 m). The longest subsonic flight lasted only 48 minutes, which was largely due to 70 percent of the aircraft&#x27;s total fuel capacity being consumed just to attain its operational altitude.

In September 1962, the first prototype made its first public appearance, being displayed on both the ground and in the air at that year&#x27;s Farnborough Air Show. During that same year, the aircraft was seen in the film &quot;Some People&quot;.

Measurements during testing were collected and, in addition to being recorded onboard, were transmitted to a ground station for live review as well as being recording and subsequently analysed. The ground station was typically manned by both an engineer and a &quot;ground pilot&quot;; the extent of the flight information transmitted permitted the ground pilot to comprehensively advise the pilot of the aircraft in real time, although it was convention for only key information to be communicated as such to avoid excessive distraction to the pilot flying.

Flight testing of the Type 188 encountered a number of problems, perhaps the principal being that the fuel consumption of the Gyron Junior engines used did not permit the aircraft to fly at high speeds long enough to evaluate the &quot;thermal soaking&quot; of the airframe, which was one of the main research areas that the Type 188 had been built to investigate. Combined with fuel leaks, the inability to reach its design speed of Mach 2 and a takeoff speed at nearly severely compromised the flight testing phase of the project. Nonetheless, although the Type 188 programme was eventually abandoned, the knowledge and technical information gained was put to some use for the future Concorde program. The inconclusive nature of the research into the use of stainless steel led to Concordes being constructed from conventional aluminium alloys with a Mach limit of 2.2. Experience gained with the Gyron Junior engine, which was the first British gas turbine designed for sustained supersonic operation, additionally later assisted with the development of the Bristol (later Rolls-Royce) Olympus 593 powerplant, which was used on both Concorde and the BAC TSR-2.

During early 1964, it was announced that all development activity on the Type 188 was to be terminated. The final flight of &quot;XF926&quot; took place on 12 January 1964. In total, the project cost £20 million. By the end of the programme, considered the most expensive to date for a research aircraft in Britain, one aircraft had to be &quot;cannibalised&quot; in order to keep the other airframe flightworthy.

==Surviving aircraft==
In April 1966, both Type 188 fuselages were transported to the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness, Essex to act as targets for gunnery trials, but during 1972, &quot;XF926&quot; was dismantled and moved to RAF Cosford (without its engines) to act as instructional airframe 8368M, and is preserved at the Royal Air Force Museum Cosford in Shropshire. &quot;XF923&quot; was subsequently scrapped at Foulness.

<text>Roosevelt Sykes (January 31, 1906July 17, 1983) was an American blues musician, also known as &quot;the Honeydripper&quot;.

==Career==
Sykes was born the son of a musician in Elmar, Arkansas. &quot;Just a little old sawmill town&quot;, Sykes said of his birthplace. The Sykes family was living in St. Louis by 1909. Sykes often visited his grandfather&#x27;s farm near West Helena. He began playing the church organ around the age of ten. &quot;Every summer I would go down to Helena to visit my grandfather on his farm,&quot; he told biographer Valerie Wilmer. &quot;He was a preacher and he had an organ I used to practice on, trying to learn how to play. I always liked the sound of the blues, liked to hear people singing, and since I was singing first, I was trying to play like I sang.&quot; Sykes was baptized at 13 years old, his lifelong beliefs never conflicting with playing the blues.

At age 15, he went on the road playing piano in a barrelhouse style of blues. Like many bluesmen of his time, he traveled around playing to all-male audiences in sawmill, turpentine and levee camps along the Mississippi River, sometimes in a duo with Big Joe Williams, gathering a repertoire of raw, sexually explicit material. In 1925 Sykes met Leothus &quot;Lee&quot; Green, a piano player in a West Helena theater playing a mix of blues, ragtime, waltz, and jazz to accompany silent movies. They worked the Louisiana and Mississippi work camp and roadhouse circuit together, with the older man acting as mentor and protector to Sykes. &quot;I just been pickin&#x27; a little cotton,&quot; Sykes would say from the stage, &quot;and pickin&#x27; a little piano.&quot; The more experienced Green taught him the style, characterized by separate bass and treble rhythms, that would become the basis for &quot;44 Blues&quot;. Sykes&#x27; wanderings eventually brought him back to St. Louis, Missouri, where he met St. Louis Jimmy Oden, the writer of the blues standard &quot;Goin&#x27; Down Slow&quot;.

After a few years Sykes found work at Katy Red&#x27;s, a barrelhouse across the river in East St. Louis, Illinois. He was paid room and board, and a dollar a night. In 1929, he was spotted by a talent scout and sent to New York City to record for Okeh Records. The talent scout was Jesse Johnson, who owned De Luxe Music Shop. After Sykes had played a few songs on the store&#x27;s piano Johnson offered him the opportunity to make his first recordings. His first release was &quot;44 Blues&quot; which became a blues standard and his signature song. Sykes recalled: &quot;I started making records 14th of June 1929. I had been playing eight years or so before I started recording. The first number I made was a hit, &#x27;44 Blues&#x27;, and every record I made was a star ever since.&quot; Sykes picked up his nickname &quot;the Honey Dripper&quot; while playing on a session for singer Edith Johnson later in 1929, during which she recorded &quot;Honeydripper Blues&quot;. Johnson later said she gave him the name due to his kind disposition and easygoing personality. Sykes claimed the sobriquet dated back to his childhood, &quot;Girls used to hang around me when I was a young kid. So the boys say, &#x27;He must have honey.&#x27;&quot; Sykes invested his earnings from recording in an illegal speakeasy that sold fried fish and alcohol, a business he continued at various locations for years. He recorded for different labels using pseudonyms, including &quot;Easy Papa Johnson&quot; for Melotone Records, &quot;Dobby Bragg&quot; for Paramount Records, &quot;Willie Kelly&quot; for Victor Records, and &quot;the Bluesman&quot; for Specialty Records, in the 1930s and 1940s. During this period he befriended another blues musician, the singer Charlie &quot;Specks&quot; McFadden, and accompanied him on half of McFadden&#x27;s recordings.

Sykes and Oden moved to Chicago, where Sykes found his first period of fame when he signed a contract with Decca Records in 1934. In 1936 he recorded &quot;Driving Wheel Blues&quot; for Decca. He was soon a sought-after session pianist for the Bullet and Bluebird labels. Sykes and Oden continued their musical friendship into the 1960s.

In 1943 Sykes began performing with his band The Honeydrippers. The band often had as many as twelve musicians, including many of Chicago&#x27;s best horn players. Despite the growing urbanity of his style, he gradually became less competitive in the post–World War II music scene. After his contract with RCA Victor expired, he recorded for smaller labels, such as United, until his opportunities ran out in the mid-1950s.

Sykes left Chicago for New Orleans in 1954, as electric blues was taking over the Chicago blues clubs. He also recorded two sessions for Imperial Records in 1955, that were produced by Dave Bartholomew. He moved back to Chicago in 1960 as the folk music revival rekindled interest in the blues. He toured Europe and performed at blues festivals in the United States. In the late 1960s Sykes moved back to New Orleans, where he played at clubs, including the Court of Two Sisters. When he recorded in the 1960s, it was for labels such as Delmark, Bluesville, Storyville and Folkways, which were documenting the quickly passing blues history. He lived his final years in New Orleans, where he died from a heart attack on July 17, 1983. He was buried at Providence Memorial Park in New Orleans in an unmarked grave.

==Technique==
Sykes said in his later years he decided to become a bluesman when he heard St. Louis piano player Red-Eye Jesse Bell. He named St. Louis musicians including Bell, Joe Crump, Baby Sneed, and his mentor &quot;Pork Chop&quot; Lee Green as his early influences. Leothus Lee &quot;Pork Chop&quot; Green, is thought to have schooled Sykes in mastering separate but complementary bass and treble rhythms.

Sykes had a big voice and a heavy foot. In his voice that could be piercing yet had a mellow side, he sang with beautiful vibrato and at times intricate embellishment. His piano style featured a simple left hand, frequently with single repeated notes on the beats, and with great rhythmic complexity in his right hand. Throughout his career his music was harmonically uncomplicated, seldom using more than the three standard blues chords. His technique was more akin to blues guitarists than to other piano players who were recorded at the time. Though he was highly skilled on breakneck boogie-woogie numbers, Sykes shone on slow and moderately paced blues. His left hand played a strong bedrock bass, keeping the beat, as his right hand roamed the length of the keyboard. He used the piano as a lead instrument rather than as part of the rhythm section. It was a style that worked without accompaniment, as well as with larger bands.

As his career progressed Sykes showed greater sophistication in the lyrics he wrote, including pop music influences, than in his playing or singing. Some of his later blues are in an 8-bar pattern, like pop or gospel, rather than in his earlier 12-bar manner. Sykes moved easily from country boogie-woogie to his urban blues piano style. A blues virtuoso, he played blues in an older way, adding flourishes, notes, and chord changes where he felt necessary, even if it meant adding or subtracting a beat. Nevertheless, Sykes was sensitive as an accompanist, responding to other musicians’ changes.

Sykes’ vocal trademark was his practice of singing half a measure ahead of his accompanying piano. Author Paul Oliver stated, &quot;His habit of anticipating a phrase on the piano gave a rhythmic impetus to his sung lines.&quot;

==Legacy==
Sykes had a long career, spanning the pre-war and postwar eras. His pounding piano boogies and risqué lyrics characterize his contributions to the blues. He was responsible for influential blues songs such as &quot;44 Blues&quot;, &quot;Driving Wheel&quot;, and &quot;Night Time Is the Right Time&quot;.

He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1999.

<text>Acid rock is a loosely defined type of rock music that evolved out of the mid-1960s garage punk movement and helped launch the psychedelic subculture. While the term has sometimes been used interchangeably with &quot;psychedelic rock&quot;, acid rock also specifically refers to a more musically intense, rawer, or heavier subgenre or sibling of psychedelic rock. Named after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the style is generally defined by heavy, distorted guitars and often contains lyrics with drug references and long improvised jams. 

Compared to other forms of psychedelic rock, acid rock features a harder, louder, heavier, or rawer sound. Much of the style overlaps with 1960s garage punk, proto-metal, and early heavy, blues-based hard rock. It developed mainly from the American West Coast, where groups did not focus on the novelty recording effects or whimsy of British psychedelia; instead, the subgenre emphasized the heavier qualities associated with both the positive and negative extremes of the psychedelic experience.

As the movement progressed into the late 1960s and 1970s, elements of acid rock split into two directions, with hard rock and heavy metal on one side and progressive rock on the other. In the 1990s, the stoner metal genre combined acid rock with other hard rock styles such as grunge and doom metal, updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in acid rock and psychedelic-influenced metal.

==Definitions==

&quot;Acid rock&quot; as a term was initially (and often still is) loosely defined. In 1969, as the genre was still solidifying, rock journalist Nik Cohn called it a &quot;fairly meaningless phrase that got applied to any group, no matter what its style&quot;. The term was originally used to describe the background music for acid trips in underground parties in the 1960s (e.g. the Merry Pranksters&#x27; &quot;Acid Tests&quot;) and as a catchall term for the more eclectic Haight-Ashbury bands in San Francisco. The Grateful Dead&#x27;s Jerry Garcia believed that acid rock is music you listen to while under the influence of acid, further stating that there is no real &quot;psychedelic rock&quot; and that it is Indian classical music and some Tibetan music &quot;designed to expand consciousness&quot;.

The term has often been deployed interchangeably with &quot;psychedelic rock&quot; or &quot;psychedelia&quot;, particularly during the genre&#x27;s nascence. However, the distinction between the heavier &quot;acid rock&quot; and the more general or inclusive genre of &quot;psychedelic rock&quot; has been well established. According to Per Elias Drabløs, &quot;acid rock is generally considered a subgenre of psychedelic rock&quot;, while Steve and Alan Freeman state the two terms are more or less synonymous, and that &quot;what is usually referred to as acid rock is generally the more extreme end of [the psychedelic rock genre]&quot;. This would mean psychedelic rock that is heavier, louder, or harder.

When defined specifically as a hard rock variant of psychedelia, acid rock is distinguished as having evolved from the 1960s garage punk movement, with many of its bands eventually transforming into heavy metal acts. Percussionist John Beck defines &quot;acid rock&quot; as synonymous with hard rock and heavy metal. The term eventually encompassed heavy, blues-based hard rock bands. Musicologist Steve Waksman wrote that &quot;the distinction between acid rock, hard rock, and heavy metal can at some point never be more than tenuous&quot;. 

==Origins and ideology==

Many bands associated with acid rock aimed to create a youth movement based on love and peace, as an alternative to workaholic capitalist society. David P. Szatmary states, &quot;a legion of rock bands, playing what became known as &#x27;acid rock,&#x27; stood in the vanguard of the movement for cultural change.&quot; Szatmary also quotes from the &quot;San Francisco Oracle&quot;, an underground newspaper published between 1966 and 1968, to explain how rock music was perceived at that time and how the acid rock movement emerged: &quot;Rock music is a regenerative and revolutionary art, offering us our first real hope for the future (indeed, for the present).&quot;

When played live at dance clubs, performances were accompanied by psychedelic-themed light shows in order to replicate the visual effects of the acid experience. According to Kevin T. McEneaney, the Grateful Dead &quot;invented&quot; acid rock in front of a crowd of concertgoers in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, the date of the second Acid Test held by author Ken Kesey. Their stage performance involved the use of strobe lights to reproduce LSD&#x27;s &quot;surrealistic fragmenting&quot; or &quot;vivid isolating of caught moments&quot;. The Acid Test experiments subsequently launched the psychedelic subculture. Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles&#x27; success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on their 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;, especially with the track &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;, as having &quot;opened the doors&quot; to acid rock. Former Atlantic Records executive Phillip Rauls recalls: &quot;I was in the music business at the time, and my very first recognition of acid rock ... was, of all people, the Beach Boys and the song &#x27;Good Vibrations&#x27; ... That [song&#x27;s electro theremin] sent so many musicians back to the studio to create this music on acid.&quot;

According to Laura Diane Kuhn, the heavier form of psychedelic rock known as acid rock developed from the late 1960s California music scene. The Charlatans were among the first Bay Area acid rock bands. Jefferson Airplane was the first Bay Area acid rock band to sign a major label and achieve mainstream success. By July 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;From jukeboxes and transistors across the nation pulses the turned-on sound of acid-rock groups: the Jefferson Airplane, the Doors, Moby Grape&quot;. In 1968, &quot;Life&quot; magazine referred to the Doors as the &quot;kings of acid rock&quot;.

Other bands credited with creating or laying the foundation for acid rock include garage rock bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators and Count Five. The blues rock group the Paul Butterfield Blues Band are also credited with spawning the harder acid rock sound, and their 1966 instrumental &quot;East-West&quot;, with its early use of the extended rock solo, has been described as laying &quot;the roots of psychedelic acid rock&quot; and featuring &quot;much of acid-rock&#x27;s eventual DNA&quot;. The Beatles&#x27; June 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was a major influence on American acid rock groups.

==Development and characteristics==

===Evolution from garage bands===

Originating in the early 1960s, garage punk was a mainly-American movement that involved R&amp;B-inspired garage bands powered by electric guitars and organs. It was mainly the domain of untrained teenagers fixated on sonic effects, such as wah-wah and fuzz tone, and relied heavily on riffs. The music later blurred into psychedelia. American garage bands who began to play psychedelic rock retained the rawness and energy of garage rock, incorporating garage rock&#x27;s heavy distortion, feedback, and layered sonic effects into their versions of psychedelic music, spawning &quot;acid rock&quot;. Bisport and Puterbaugh, defining acid rock as an intense or raw form of psychedelia, include &quot;garagey&quot; psychedelia under the label of &quot;acid rock&quot; due in part to its &quot;energy and intimation of psychic overload&quot;. Exemplary acts of &quot;garagey&quot; psychedelia include Blues Magoos, the Electric Prunes, and the Music Machine, all of which may be defined as early acid rock bands.

The earliest known use of the term &quot;garage punk&quot; appeared in Lenny Kaye&#x27;s track-by-track liner notes for the 1972 anthology compilation &quot;&quot;, which prominently featured both acid rock and garage rock. Musicologist Simon Frith cites &quot;Nuggets&quot; as a showcase for the garage psychedelia of the 1960s and the transition between early 1960s garage rock and the more elaborate acid rock of the late 1960s. This acid rock present in the &quot;Nuggets&quot; anthology has been described as an offshoot of 1960s &quot;punk rock&quot;. At the time, the term &quot;punk rock&quot; referred to the garage rock of the 1960s, such as that present in the &quot;Nuggets&quot; compilation. Bands such as Count Five, with their 1966 song &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;, as well as other groups featured on &quot;Nuggets&quot;, would eventually epitomize the overlap between 1960s garage rock and psychedelic punk, or acid rock. As one of the first successful acid rock songs, &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot; also contained the characteristics that would come to define acid rock: the use of feedback and distortion replacing early rock music&#x27;s more melodic electric guitars.

Another group included on the &quot;Nuggets&quot; album, the 13th Floor Elevators, began as a straight garage rock band before becoming one of the original early acid rock bands and the innovators of psychedelic rock in general, with a sound consisting of distortion, often yelping vocals, and &quot;occasionally demented&quot; lyrics. Their debut album, &quot;The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators&quot;, featuring the garage rock hit &quot;You&#x27;re Gonna Miss Me&quot;, was among the earliest psychedelic rock albums. By 1966, the New York City garage band the Blues Magoos were referring to their wailing blues rock as &quot;psychedelic music&quot;, and their hard variant of psychedelic rock, with its roots in the garage movement, would be increasingly labeled &quot;acid rock&quot;.

===Distinctions from other psychedelic rock===


Acid rock often encompasses the more extreme side of the psychedelic rock genre, frequently containing a loud, improvised, and guitar-centered sound. Alan Bisbort and Parke Puterbaugh write that acid rock &quot;can best be described as psychedelia at its rawest and most intense ... Bad trips as well as good, riots as well as peace, pain as well as pleasure - the whole spectrum of reality, not just the idyllic bits, were captured by acid rock.&quot; &quot;Acid rock&quot; has also been described as more heavily electric and containing more distortion (&quot;fuzz&quot;) than typical psychedelic rock. By the late 1960s, in addition to the deliberate use of distortion and feedback, acid rock was further characterized by long guitar solos and the frequent use of electronic organs. Lyric references to drug use were also common, as exemplified in Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s 1967 song &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s 1967 song &quot;Purple Haze&quot;. Lyrical references to drugs such as LSD were often cryptic.

At a time when many British psychedelic bands played whimsical or surrealistic psychedelic rock, many 1960s American rock bands, especially those from the West Coast, developed a rawer or harder version of psychedelic rock containing garage rock energy. When contrasted with whimsical British psychedelia, this harder American West Coast variant of psychedelic rock has been referred to as acid rock. American psychedelic rock and garage bands such as the 13th Floor Elevators epitomized the frenetic, darker and more psychotic sound of American acid rock, a sound characterized by droning guitar riffs, amplified feedback, and guitar distortion. Hoffman writes that acid rock lacked the recording studio &quot;gimmickry&quot; that typified the more Beatles-influenced strain of psychedelic rock, though acid rock experimented in other ways with electrified guitar effects.

Tonal distortion was also one of the defining characteristics of the San Francisco Sound. The acid rock of the San Francisco Sound heavily incorporated musical improvisation, jamming, repetitive drum beats, experimental sound and tape effects, and intentional feedback. San Francisco acid rock generally took a non-commercial approach to song-writing: it often involved almost free jazz-like, free-form hard rock improvisations alongside distorted guitars, and lyrics often were socially conscious, trippy, or anti-establishment. Many of the musicians in the scene, including bands such as the Charlatans and the Quicksilver Messenger Service, became involved in Ken Kesey&#x27;s LSD-driven psychedelic scene, known as the Merry Pranksters.

===Transition to hard rock and heavy metal===

Heavy metal evolved from psychedelic music and acid rock and added psychedelic/acid rock to the basic structure of blues rock. In the 1960s, the heavy, blues-influenced, psychedelic hard rock sound of bands such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, and Cream was classified as acid rock. Other acid rock groups such as Blue Cheer, Iron Butterfly, and Vanilla Fudge served as examples of early heavy metal, or proto-metal, creating stripped-downed, loud, intense, and &quot;fuzzy&quot; acid rock or hard rock. Bands such as Blue Cheer, Cream, and the hard rock group The Amboy Dukes have all been described as &quot;leading practitioners&quot; of the harder variant of psychedelic rock known as &quot;acid rock&quot;. Many acid rock bands would subsequently become heavy metal bands. 

The influence of acid rock was evident in the sound of heavy metal in the 1970s. Iron Butterfly&#x27;s &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; is sometimes described as an example of the transition between acid rock and heavy metal or the turning point in which acid rock became &quot;heavy metal&quot;. &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; serves a notable example of 1960s and early 1970s acid rock or heavy psychedelia, and the band would continue to experiment with distorted, &quot;fuzzy&quot;, heavy psychedelia into the 1970s. Both Iron Butterfly&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot; and Blue Cheer&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; have been described as influential in the transition of acid rock into heavy metal. Heavy metal&#x27;s acid rock origins can further be seen in the loud acid rock of groups such as Steppenwolf, who contributed their song &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; to the soundtrack of the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, which itself glamorized the genre. Ultimately, Steppenwolf and other acid rock groups such as Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Led Zeppelin paved the way for the electrified, bluesy sound of early heavy metal.

Coven is an American rock band formed in Chicago in the late 1960s. They had a top 40 hit in 1971 with the song &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot;, the theme song of the movie &quot;Billy Jack.&quot;In addition to pioneering occult rock with lyrics and aesthetics that explicitly dealt in themes of Satanism and witchcraft, they are recognized by metal fans and metal historians as being the band that introduced the &quot;Sign of the horns&quot; to rock, metal and pop culture, as seen on their 1969 debut album release &quot;Witchcraft Destroys Minds &amp; Reaps Souls&quot;. By the early 1970s, bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath combined the loud, raw distortion of acid rock with occult lyrics, further forming a basis for the genre now known as &quot;heavy metal&quot;. At a time when rock music began to turn back to roots-oriented soft rock, many acid rock groups instead evolved into heavy metal bands. As its own movement, heavy metal music continued to perpetuate characteristics of acid rock bands into at least the 1980s, and traces of psychedelic rock can be seen in the musical excesses of later metal bands. In the 1990s, the stoner metal genre combined acid rock with other hard rock genres such as grunge, updating the heavy riffs and long jams found in the acid rock and psychedelic-influenced metal of bands such as Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer, Hawkwind, and Blue Öyster Cult.

In addition to hard rock and heavy metal, acid rock also gave rise to the progressive rock movement. In the 1970s, elements of psychedelic music split into two notable directions, evolving into the hard rock and heavy metal of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin on one side and into the progressive rock of bands such Pink Floyd and Yes on the other. Bands such as Yes, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer kept the psychedelic musical movement alive for some time, but eventually moved away from drug-themed music towards experiments in electronic music and the addition of classical music themes into rock music.

<doc id="523350" wikidata="Q1693740" url="?curid=523350" title="Suicide door">
<text>A suicide door is an automobile door hinged at its rear rather than the front. Such doors were originally used on horse-drawn carriages but are rarely found on modern vehicles, primarily because they are less safe than front-hinged doors. 

If the vehicle were moving and the rear-hinged door opened, aerodynamic drag would force the door open, and the person would have to lean out of the vehicle to reach the handle to close it. As seat belts were not commonly used at that time, the person could easily fall out of the car and into traffic, hence the name &quot;suicide door&quot;. Another risk was from a car speeding past the parked car in the same direction. A front-hinged door would tend to be ripped off the parked car, but someone partly outside it might escape injury if they were not directly in the path of the speeding car. In contrast, a rear-hinged door would be forced shut, striking the person.

Initially standard on many models, later they became popularized in the custom car trade. Automobile manufacturers call the doors coach doors (Rolls-Royce), flexdoors (Vauxhall), freestyle doors (Mazda), rear access doors (Saturn), clamshell doors (BMW), or simply back-hinged doors.

==History==

Rear-hinged doors were common on cars manufactured in the first half of the 20th century, including the iconic Citroën Traction Avant. In the era before seat belts, the accidental opening of such doors meant that there was a greater risk of falling out of the vehicle compared to front-hinged doors, where airflow pushed the doors closed rather than opening them further.

Rear-hinged doors were especially popular with mobsters in the gangster era of the 1930s, supposedly owing to the ease of pushing passengers out of moving vehicles with the air around the moving car holding the door open, according to Dave Brownell, the former editor of &quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot;.

After World War II, rear-hinged doors were mostly limited to rear doors of four-door sedans. The best-known use of rear-hinged doors on post-World War II American automobiles was the Lincoln Continental 4-door convertibles and sedans (1961–1969), Cadillac Eldorado Brougham (1956–1959) four-door sedans, and Ford Thunderbird (1967–1971) four-door sedans. The British Rover P4 used rear-hinged doors at the rear. German Goggomobil saloons and coupes had two-door bodies with rear-hinged doors until 1964. The French, hand-made Facel Vega Excellence offered a four-door hardtop with a Chrysler-sourced Hemi V8 beginning in 1954.

==Modern use==

In 2003, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom car reintroduced independent rear-hinged doors in luxury vehicle applications. Other luxury models with rear-hinged doors include the Spyker D8 and the Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe four-seat convertible. The most recent mass-produced model with such doors may be the Opel Meriva, followed by the Rolls-Royce Cullinan in 2018, and a few Chinese electric vehicles including the Singulato iS6 in 2018 and HiPhi X in 2020. Lincoln announced that 80 limited-edition 2019 Continentals would be made with &quot;coach&quot; doors, marking the Continental&#x27;s 80th anniversary. The 2020 Citroen Ami electric vehicle is unusual in having a suicide door for the driver but a conventional door for the passenger, as the doors are identical units that are not differentiated by side.

In the early 2000s, rear-hinged rear doors that are held closed by the front doors, and cannot be opened until released by opening the front door on the same side (hinged at the front), have appeared on a number of vehicles. Such doors may be referred to as clamshell doors. Examples include extended-cab pickup trucks, the Saturn SC, Saturn Ion Quad Coupe, Honda Element, Toyota FJ Cruiser, BMW i3, Mini Cooper Clubman, Mazda RX-8, Mazda MX-30 and Fiat 500 3+1.

Rear passenger rear-hinged doors had long been used on Austin FX4 London taxis, discontinued on their successors the TX1, TXII and TX4, but reintroduced in the 2018 LEVC TX.

Several concept cars have featured rear-hinged doors, such as the Lincoln C, a hatchback with no B-pillar and rear-hinged doors at the rear, or the Carbon Motors Corporation E7, a police car with rear rear-hinged doors designed to aid officers getting handcuffed passengers in and out of the back seat. The Kia Naimo, an electric concept car, also has rear suicide doors.

Other car manufacturers which have produced models with suicide doors include Citroën, Lancia, Opel, Panhard, Rover, Saab, Saturn, Škoda, Studebaker, Ferrari, Mazda and Volkswagen.

==Advantages==

Rear-hinged doors make entering and exiting a vehicle easier, allowing a passenger to enter by turning to sit and exit by stepping forward and out. This is important for passengers who need to make a dignified entrance; the UK State Bentley has rear-opening passenger doors that are broader than usual and open very wide, allowing the monarch to exit the car in a dignified way.

In combination with traditional front doors, rear-hinged doors allow chauffeurs easier access to the rear door. In Austin FX4 taxis, drivers were able to reach the rear exterior door handle through the driver&#x27;s window without getting out of the vehicle.

Rear-hinged doors also allow a better position for a person installing a child seat into the back seat of a vehicle than conventional doors, while being simpler and cheaper to build than the sliding doors commonly used on minivans. The Opel Meriva B compact MPV introduced in 2010 had such doors.

The combination of front-hinged front doors and rear-hinged rear doors allows for a design without the B-pillar, creating a large opening for entering and exiting the vehicle.

==Disadvantages==

When front doors are directly adjacent to rear suicide doors, exiting and entering the vehicle can be awkward if people try to use the front and back doors at the same time.

There are also a number of safety hazards:

* Aerodynamic factors forcing rear-hinged doors open at speed in older cars. In 1969, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; reported this problem on a Subaru 360.
* If a person not wearing a seat belt falls out of a moving car with a coach door, the door can catch them and drag them along the road at speed, causing serious injuries.
* If a person exits a vehicle while parallel parked and a car hits the door from the rear, the person would be crushed instead of the door being ripped off.

Car manufacturers mitigate these hazards with such safety features as seat belts, and locks requiring front-hinged doors be open before permitting rear-hinged doors to open.

<text>Jimmy Lee Ruffin (May 7, 1936 – November 17, 2014) was an American soul singer, and the older brother of David Ruffin, the lead singer of the Temptations. He had several hit records between the 1960s and 1980s, the most successful being the Top 10 hits &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; and &quot;Hold On (To My Love)&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Jimmy Ruffin was born in 1936 in Collinsville, Mississippi, to Eli, a sharecropper, and Ophelia Ruffin. He was approaching his fifth birthday when his younger brother David was born. As children, the brothers began singing with a gospel group, the Dixie Nightingales.

In 1961, Jimmy became a singer as part of the Motown stable, mostly on sessions but also recording singles for its subsidiary Miracle label, but was then drafted for national service. After leaving the Army in 1964, he returned to Motown, where he was offered the opportunity to join the Temptations to replace Elbridge Bryant. However, after hearing his brother David, they hired him for the job instead so Jimmy decided to resume his solo career. Ruffin recorded for Motown&#x27;s subsidiary Soul label, but with little success.

===Career===
In 1966, he heard a song about unrequited love written for The Spinners, and persuaded the writers that he should record it himself. His recording of &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; became a major success. The song reached #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #6 on the R&amp;B Chart. It also initially reached #8 in the UK Singles Chart, rising to #4 when it was reissued in the UK in 1974. &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; remains Ruffin&#x27;s best-known song. It was the lead single from his debut album &quot;Jimmy Ruffin Sings Top Ten&quot; (released as &quot;The Jimmy Ruffin Way&quot; in the UK), which was released on the Motown&#x27;s Soul subsidiary label in 1967. Follow-up singles in America were successful, with &quot;I&#x27;ve Passed This Way Before&quot; and &quot;Gonna Give Her All The Love I&#x27;ve Got&quot; in late 1966 and early 1967.

Ruffin&#x27;s second album, &quot;Ruff &#x27;n&#x27; Ready&quot;, was released in 1969. It contained the song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Miss Me a Little Bit Baby&quot;, which made the lower parts of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (#68) and was a Top 30 hit on the R&amp;B Charts, peaking at #27. As a solo artist, it would prove to be Ruffin&#x27;s last significant chart appearance in America for many years, and his last significant charting record for Motown in the US. The song was also released as the B-side to &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; when it was reissued in 1974.

As Ruffin found success in the United States difficult to sustain, he began to concentrate instead on the British market. In 1970, &quot;Farewell Is a Lonely Sound&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Say Forever My Love&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Wonderful (To Be Loved by You)&quot; each made the UK Top Ten, and he was voted the world&#x27;s top singer in one British poll. He also teamed up with brother David to record the album &quot;I Am My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, a modestly successful 1970 album for Motown that included the songs &quot;When The Love Hand Comes Down&quot;, &quot;Your Love Was Worth Waiting For&quot; and a cover of Ben E. King&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. His third solo album for the label, &quot;The Groove Governor&quot;, was released in 1970, and did not fare as well as his previous two albums.

Following the success of his initial hits, Ruffin found it hard to maintain an identity, as most of his songs were later covered by other Motown artists, most prominently &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot;, a hit when covered by Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips for their 1967 debut album of the same name, &quot;Maria (You Were The Only One)&quot;, a hit for Michael Jackson and &quot;If You Let Me,&quot; a minor hit for Eddie Kendricks. In addition, he had recorded the first version of The Temptations hit &quot;Beauty Is Only Skin Deep&quot;.

He then left Motown, and recorded for the Polydor and Chess labels, where he recorded &quot;Tell Me What You Want.&quot; In 1980, Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees produced his album &quot;Sunrise&quot; and the hit single &quot;Hold On To My Love&quot;, which reached #10 in the US and #7 in the UK, on the RSO label.

In the 1980s, Ruffin moved to live in Great Britain, where he continued to perform successfully. In December 1984 he collaborated with Paul Weller of The Style Council for his benefit single &quot;Soul Deep&quot;, produced to raise money for the families of striking miners affected by the UK miners&#x27; strike. This went under the name of The Council Collective and Jimmy appeared with Paul on Radio 1 to say he is involved because his father worked down the mines and &quot;he understands the suffering.&quot;

In 1986 he collaborated with the British pop group Heaven 17, singing &quot;A Foolish Thing to Do&quot; and &quot;My Sensitivity&quot; on a 12&quot; EP record. In 1987, Ruffin recorded &quot;Easy Just To Say I Love You&quot;, which was written by Peter Marsh, Mae McKenna and Julian Marshall. He took part in recording for Ian Levine&#x27;s Motown revival label, Motorcity Records, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He recorded duets with both Maxine Nightingale and Brenda Holloway. Later, Ruffin hosted a radio show in the UK for a time, and became an anti-drug advocate following the 1991 drug overdose death of his brother David. Ruffin was portrayed by Lamman Rucker in the 1998 mini-series &quot;The Temptations&quot;.

===Later life and death===
Following the 2010 release - on CD for the first time - of his 1970 album &quot;I Am My Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, Ruffin had been writing and recording songs for a new album that he had planned to release during 2013. It was not finished at the time of his death.

In 2012, a compilation album titled &quot;There Will Never Be Another You&quot;, including his hit songs &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot;, and &quot;Hold On To My Love&quot;, had been released.

Ruffin lived in the area of Las Vegas, Nevada. On October 17, 2014, it was reported that he was gravely ill and had been taken into an intensive care unit at a Las Vegas hospital. He died on November 17, 2014, in Las Vegas, aged 78.
Ruffin is buried at Palm Memorial Park Northwest Cemetery, Las Vegas, Clark County, Nevada in the Garden of Eternal Life Section.

===Family===
His siblings were Davis Eli (David), Reada May (Marie), Rosine, and Quincy B (all deceased). His children are Arlet, Philicia, Jimmie Ray (deceased), Jimmy Jr., Ophelia, Camilla and Jimmie Ray Vaughn.

<text>Johnny Rivers (born John Henry Ramistella; November 7, 1942) is an American retired musician. He achieved commercial success and popularity throughout the 1960s and 1970s as a singer and guitarist, characterized as a versatile and influential artist. Rivers is best known for his 1960s output, having popularized the mid-60s discotheque scene through his live rock and roll recordings at the Los Angeles nightclub Whisky a Go Go, and later shifting to a more orchestral, soul-oriented sound during the latter half of the decade. These developments were reflected by his most notable string of hit singles between 1964 and 1968, many of them covers. They include &quot;Memphis&quot;, &quot;Mountain of Love&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Son&quot;, &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot;, &quot;Poor Side of Town&quot;, &quot;Baby I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Summer Rain&quot;. Rivers had a total of nine top-ten hits and 17 top-forty hits on the US charts from 1964 to 1977.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Born John Henry Ramistella in New York City, Rivers is of Italian descent. His family moved from New York to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Influenced by the distinctive Louisiana musical style, Rivers began playing guitar at age eight, taught by his father and uncle. While still in junior high school, he started sitting in with a band called the Rockets, led by Dick Holler, who later wrote several hit songs, including &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot; and the novelty song &quot;Snoopy vs. the Red Baron&quot;.

Ramistella formed his own band, the Spades, and made his first record at 14 while he was a student at Baton Rouge High School. Some of their music was recorded on the Suede label as early as 1956.

On a trip to New York City in 1958, Ramistella met Alan Freed, who advised him to change his name to &quot;Johnny Rivers&quot; referencing the Mississippi River that flows through Baton Rouge. Freed also helped Rivers get several recording contracts on the Gone label. From March 1958 to March 1959, Johnny Rivers released three records, including &quot;Baby Come Back&quot; (a non-Christmas version of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)&quot;), none of which sold well.

Rivers returned to Baton Rouge in 1959 and began playing throughout the American South alongside comedian Brother Dave Gardner. One evening in Birmingham, Alabama, Rivers met Audrey Williams, Hank Williams&#x27; first wife. She encouraged Rivers to move to Nashville, Tennessee, where he found work as a songwriter and demo singer. Rivers also worked alongside Roger Miller. By this time, Rivers had decided he would never make it as a singer and songwriting became his priority.

===1960s===

In 1958, Rivers met fellow Louisianan James Burton, a guitarist in a band led by Ricky Nelson. Burton later recommended one of Rivers&#x27;s songs, &quot;I&#x27;ll Make Believe,&quot; to Nelson, who recorded it. They met in Los Angeles in 1961, where Rivers subsequently found work as a songwriter and studio musician. His big break came in 1963 when he filled in for a jazz combo at Gazzarri&#x27;s, a nightclub in Hollywood where his instant popularity drew large crowds.

In 1964, Elmer Valentine gave Rivers a one-year contract to open at the Whisky a Go Go on Sunset Strip in West Hollywood. The Whisky had been in business just three days when the Beatles song &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The subsequent British Invasion knocked almost every American artist off the top of the charts but Rivers was so popular that record producer Lou Adler decided to issue &quot;Johnny Rivers Live at the Whisky a Go Go&quot;, which reached No. 12. Rivers recalled that his most requested live song then was &quot;Memphis&quot;, which reached No. 2 on Cash Box on 4–11 July 1964 and also on the Hot 100 on 11–18 July 1964. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. According to Elvis Presley&#x27;s friend and employee, Alan Fortas, Presley played a test pressing of &quot;Memphis&quot; for Rivers that Presley had made but not released. Rivers was impressed and much to Presley&#x27;s chagrin, Rivers recorded and released it even copying the arrangement. Rivers&#x27;s version far outsold the Chuck Berry original from August 1959, which stalled at No. 87 in the US.

Rivers continued to record mostly live performances throughout 1964 and 1965, including Go-Go-style records with songs featuring folk music and blues rock influences including &quot;Maybellene&quot; (another Berry cover), after which came &quot;Mountain of Love&quot;, &quot;Midnight Special&quot;, &quot;Seventh Son&quot; (written by Willie Dixon) plus Pete Seeger&#x27;s&quot; Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;, all of which were hits.
In 1963, Rivers began working with writers P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri on a theme song for the American broadcast of a British television series &quot;Danger Man&quot;, starring Patrick McGoohan. At first Rivers balked at the idea but eventually changed his mind. The American version of the show, titled &quot;Secret Agent&quot;, went on the air in the spring of 1965. The theme song was very popular and created public demand for a longer single version. Rivers&#x27;s recording of &quot;Secret Agent Man&quot; reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1966. It sold a million copies also winning gold disc status.

In 1966, Rivers began to record ballads that featured background vocalists. The album &quot;Changes&quot; included the song &quot;Poor Side of Town&quot; which he wrote and co-produced and became his biggest chart hit and his only No. 1 record. He also started his own record company, Soul City Records, which included the 5th Dimension. The group&#x27;s recordings of &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot; and &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; became No. 1 hits for the new label. In addition, Rivers is credited with giving songwriter Jimmy Webb a major break when the 5th Dimension recorded his song &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;. Rivers also recorded Webb&#x27;s &quot;By the Time I Get to Phoenix&quot;. It was covered by Glen Campbell, who had a major hit with it.

Rivers continued to record more hits covering other artists, including &quot;Baby I Need Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, originally recorded by the Four Tops, and &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot; by the Miracles, both going Top 10 in 1967. In 1968, Rivers put out &quot;Realization&quot;, a No. 5 album that included the No. 14 pop chart single &quot;Summer Rain&quot;, written by a former member of the Mugwumps, James Hendricks. The album included some of the psychedelic influences of the time, like the song &quot;Hey Joe&quot; with a two-minute introduction and marked a change in Rivers&#x27;s musical direction with more introspective songs including &quot;Look to Your Soul&quot; and &quot;Going Back to Big Sur&quot;.

===1970s===

In the 1970s, Rivers continued to record more songs and albums that were successes with music critics but did not sell well. &quot;L.A. Reggae&quot; (1972) reached the LP chart as a result of the No. 6 hit &quot;Rockin&#x27; Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu,&quot; a cover version of the Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith and the Clowns song. The track became Rivers&#x27;s third million seller, which was acknowledged with the presentation of a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (R.I.A.A.) on January 29, 1973. 

Reviewing &quot;L.A. Reggae&quot; in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said, &quot;there are modernization moves, of course—two get-out-the-vote songs (just what George needs) plus the mysterious reggae conceit plus a heartfelt if belated antiwar song—but basically this is just Johnny nasalizing on some fine old memories. &#x27;Rockin&#x27; Pneumonia&#x27; and &#x27;Knock on Wood&#x27; are especially fine.&quot;

Other Hot 100 top 40 hits from that time period were 1973&#x27;s &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; (originally recorded in 1955 by Carl Perkins) and 1975&#x27;s &quot;Help Me Rhonda&quot; (originally a No. 1 hit for the Beach Boys), on which Brian Wilson sang back-up vocals.

Rivers&#x27;s last Top 10 entry was his 1977 recording of &quot;Swayin&#x27; to the Music (Slow Dancing),&quot; written by Jack Tempchin and originally released by Funky Kings. Rivers&#x27;s last Hot 100 entry, also in 1977, was &quot;Curious Mind (Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um),&quot; originally released by Major Lance and written by Curtis Mayfield. In addition, Rivers recorded the title song for the late night concert-influenced TV show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. His career total is nine Top 10 hits on the Hot 100 and 17 in the Top 40 from 1964 to 1977.
===1980s to present===
Rivers continued releasing material into the 1980s (e.g. 1980&#x27;s &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; LP), garnering an interview with Dick Clark on American Bandstand in 1981, although his recording career was winding down. Around this time, Rivers turned to Christianity.

In 1998 he reactivated his Soul City Records label and released &quot;Last Train to Memphis&quot;. In early 2000, Rivers recorded with Eric Clapton, Tom Petty and Paul McCartney on a tribute album dedicated to Buddy Holly&#x27;s backup band, the Crickets.

He is one of a small number of performers whose names are listed as the copyright owner on their recordings. Most records list the recording company as the owner of the recording. Others include Mariah Carey, Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Pink Floyd (from 1975&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; onward), Queen, Genesis (though under the members&#x27; individual names and/or the pseudonym Gelring Limited), and Neil Diamond. The practice began with the Bee Gees and their $200 million lawsuit against RSO Records, the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. 

On June 12, 2009, Johnny Rivers was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame. His name has been suggested many times for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but he has never been selected. Rivers, however, was a nominee for 2015 induction into America&#x27;s Pop Music Hall of Fame.

On April 9, 2017, he performed a song, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, at the funeral for Chuck Berry, at The Pageant, in St. Louis, Missouri.

In 2019, Rivers announced his farewell tour. His last live performance was in July 2023 at Commerce Casino near Los Angeles.

<text>Primary is a 1960 American direct cinema documentary film about the 1960 Democratic Party primary election in Wisconsin between John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey, part of their quest to be chosen as the United States Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for President of the United States in the general election.

==Production==
Produced by Robert Drew and shot by Richard Leacock, D. A. Pennebaker, Terence Macartney-Filgate, and Albert Maysles, the film was a breakthrough in documentary film style. Most importantly, through the use of mobile cameras and lighter sound equipment, the filmmakers were able to follow the candidates as they wound their way through cheering crowds, cram with them into cars and crowded hotel rooms, and hover around their faces as they awaited polling results. This resulted in a greater intimacy than was possible with the older, more classical techniques of documentary filmmaking, and it established what has since become the standard style of video reporting.

==Legacy==
In 1990, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Primary&quot; in 1998. The film&#x27;s importance in the evolution of documentary filmmaking was explored in the film &quot;Cinéma Vérité: Defining the Moment&quot;.

<text>The Robins were a successful and influential American R&amp;B group of the late 1940s and 1950s, one of the earliest such vocal groups who established the basic pattern for the doo-wop sound. They were founded by Ty Terrell, and twin brothers Billy Richards and Roy Richards. Bobby Nunn soon joined the lineup. They began their career as the Bluebirds but switched to recording as the Robins in May 1949. In 1955, the group disagreed over whether to remain on the West Coast or sign with Atlantic Records and move to the East Coast. This led to a split within the group. Music producers and songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller took former Robins members Nunn and Carl Gardner, recruited singers Leon Hughes and Billy Guy, and formed the Coasters. The founding Richards brothers and Tyrell continued to record as the Robins until 1961.

== Original members ==
*Bobby Nunn (lead/bass)
*Terrell &quot;Ty&quot; Leonard (tenor)
*William Gene &quot;Billy&quot; Richard (tenor)
*Roy Richard (baritone/bass)
*Grady Chapman (lead/tenor)

== Deaths ==
Roy Richard died on May 1, 1983.

Bobby Nunn died from a heart attack on November 5, 1986.

Billy Richard died from a fall while exercising on December 10, 2007.

Grady Chapman died of congestive heart failure on January 4, 2011.

Carl Gardner died on June 12, 2011, after many years leading The Coasters.

<doc id="523367" wikidata="Q522291" url="?curid=523367" title="Ram-raiding">
<text>Ram-raiding is a type of burglary in which a heavy vehicle is driven into the windows or doors of a building, usually a department store or jeweller&#x27;s shop, to allow the perpetrators to loot it.

== Etymology ==

The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the earliest known usage of the compound noun &quot;ram raid&quot; dates from 1987. It first appeared in the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot;, a Newcastle upon Tyne newspaper. The noun &quot;ram-raider&quot; also comes from the same newspaper, also in 1987. That dictionary also notes that the term &quot;ram-raiding&quot; was used as a noun by &quot;PR Newswire&quot; in 1990, while the term &quot;ram-raid&quot; was used as a verb by the &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper of London in 1991. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary notes that the term &quot;ram-raiding&quot; is a noun of British origin. The Collins English Dictionary notes the term can be spelt using a space, as in &quot;ram raid&quot;, or using a hyphen, as in &quot;ram-raid&quot; and indicates these terms can be used as both nouns and verbs. It also describes &quot;ram-raiding&quot; as a present participle of &quot;ram-raid&quot;. Also it notes that the plural form is &quot;ram-raids&quot; or &quot;ram raids&quot;, while derived forms of &quot;ram-raider&quot; or &quot;ram raider&quot;, &quot;ram-raiding&quot; or &quot;ram raiding&quot; also exist as nouns. 

=== Definition ===
Whichever term is used, the act involves using a vehicle to break into and gain entry into premises, or attempt to do so, usually to steal the contents. In most jurisdictions the act is considered a type of burglary, or robbery, as few jurisdictions have defined the act as a specific criminal offence.

== Overview ==

The term came into widespread use after a series of such raids in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 1979 that was covered in news reports and in countries such as Australia and New Zealand that inspired a series of similar crimes.

Notably, large trucks are used to break into technology companies and steal high-value equipment for resale on the black market.

Commercial properties in areas prone to ram-raids often erect barriers or obstructions, such as bollards, to discourage such attacks. Automated teller machines are also targets of ram-raiding, with criminals smashing the machines to steal cash boxes.

Many companies have come up with solutions to ram-raiding. Everything from electronic bollards to electronic barriers has been employed to keep property from the raiders.

Another solution is security guards, but round-the-clock teams are expensive and often not the most economical way of dealing with ram-raiding.

==In New Zealand==
Ram raiding has been seen as becoming an epidemic in New Zealand during the 2020s. In July 2022, Radio New Zealand reported a 400% increase in ram raids between 2017 and 2022; with 76% of those arrested being under the age of 18 years and 14% having connections to organised crime. Key driving factors included the influence of social media, dysfunctional family backgrounds, lack of role models, and poverty. Most vehicles used in ram-raids are used ex-Japan models such as the Mazda Demio, Mazda Atenza, Nissan Tiida and Toyota Aqua; these cars are easy to steal due to Japan&#x27;s low crime rate and therefore low uptake of anti-theft measures such as immobilisers. The New Zealand Police took enforcement action against 37% of the ram raids; with 61% of offenders being prosecuted and another 39% being referred to youth agencies. In 2022 alone, police recorded 516 ram raids and apprehended 708 offenders; with 495 being under 17 years, 70 under 13 years, and 88 being adults.

In response to ram raids, the Government allocated NZ$6,000,000 for the Police&#x27;s Small Retailer Crime Prevention Fund in late August 2022. The fund allows stores to purchase protective equipment such as shatterproof glass, bollards, fog cannons, and roller doors to counter ram raids. By March 2023, over NZ$2,000,000 had been spent from the fund. Police Commissioner Andrew Coster expressed concern about police difficulty with prosecuting juvenile offenders. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern stated that the Labour Government preferred alternatives to incarcerating youths in order to reduce reoffending. By contrast, opposition ACT party leader David Seymour has advocated fitting youth offenders with ankle bracelets to counter ram-raids and robberies. Similarly, the opposition National Party leader Christopher Luxon has advocated sending young ram-raiders and other serious youth offenders to military-style boot camps.

In late August 2023, the Labour Government introduced a new bill, the Ram Raid Offending and Related Measures Amendment Bill, which seeks to add ram-raiding and other &quot;smash and grab&quot; offenses to the Crimes Act 1961 and give Police the power to prosecute juvenile ram raiders including 12 year olds. While the bill was supported by the Labour, National and ACT parties, it was opposed by the Green Party and Te Pāti Māori.

In November 2023, Newshub reported a gradual decline in ram raids in New Zealand throughout the year. Between January and September 2023, 407 ram raids were reported, compared with 707 in 2022. There were 33 reported ram raids in August 2023 and 28 in September. To counter ram-raiding, Police responses were managed at the district level and included significant investigations to identify and prosecute offenders. Police and other agencies were also trialling a strengthened multi-agency response in Auckland to address the causes of youth engaging in risky behaviour and offending. By November 2023, the Government had allocated NZ$6 million from the Proceeds of Crime Fund to counter ram raids such as installing bollards and other security for small retailers. In June 2024, RNZ reported that ram raids in New Zealand had declined from a peak of 433 in 2022 to 288 in 2023, citing Police figures. 67 ram raids were also reported in the first four months of 2024. There were 12 ram raids in April 2024 compared with 64 in April 2023. 70% of identified ram raiders were aged between 14 and 17 years while 12% were aged between 10 and 13 years.

<doc id="523368" wikidata="Q1187520" url="?curid=523368" title="Kagoshima Main Line">
<text>The is a major railway line operated by the Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) between Mojikō in Kitakyushu, and Kagoshima Station in Kagoshima City, at the southern end of Kyushu. Until March 13, 2004, it extended between its two termini; however, with the opening of the Kyushu Shinkansen on March 13, the section between Yatsushiro and Sendai was transferred to the third-sector Hisatsu Orange Railway Company. The line is an important line in Kyushu, connecting Fukuoka (Hakata Station) to many other major cities. It is the main line through the Fukuoka urban district, and as such many long-distance express trains from all parts of Kyushu use the section between Kokura Station (Kitakyushu) and Tosu Station, where the Nagasaki Main Line meets the Kagoshima Main Line.

==Stations==
===Mojikō – Arao===
===Arao – Yatsushiro===
===Sendai – Kagoshima===
===Footnotes===
===Former Yatsushiro – Sendai section===
This section was transferred to the Hisatsu Orange Railway Line from March 13, 2004. Some through services operate over this section.

Yatsushiro - Higo-Kōda - Hinagu (Hinagu-Onsen) - Higo-Futami - Kami-Tanoura - (Tanoura-Otachimisaki-Kōen) - Higo-Tanoura - Uminoura - Sashiki - Yunoura - Tsunagi - (Shin-Minamata) - Minamata - Fukuro - Komenotsu - Izumi - Nishi-Izumi - Takaono - Nodagō - Origuchi - Akune - Ushinohama - Satsuma-Ōkawa - Nishikata - Satsuma-Taki - Kusamichi - Kami-Sendai - Sendai

*Names in brackets are stations newly built or renamed after the line was transferred.

==History==

The Kyushu Railway opened the 197 km Mojiko - Hakata - Kumamoto section between 1889 and 1891, extended the line south to Yatsushiro by 1896 and the company was nationalised in 1907.

At the southern end the line from Kagoshima to Hayato (now part of the Nippo Main Line) opened as part of the Hisatsu Line in 1901. The Hayato to Yoshimatsu section of the Hisatsu line opened in 1903, the Yatsushiro to Hitoyoshi section opened in 1908, and the Hitoyoshi to Yoshimatsu section in 1909, providing the original connection from Kagoshima to Yatsushiro.

The Kagoshima to Sendai line opened between 1913 and 1914, and the Sendai to Yatsushiro section opened between 1922 and 1927, at which time this route replaced the Hisatsu Line to become the southern part of the Kagoshima Main Line.

In 2004, following the opening of the Kagoshima to Shin-Yatsushiro section of the Kyushu Shinkansen, the Yatsushiro to Sendai section was transferred to the third-sector Hisatsu Orange Railway.

===Duplication===
The Moji to Kokura section was double-tracked in 1897. The 14 km Kokura to Kurosaki section (on a new alignment to the west of the original line) opened in 1908, and was completed to Hakata by 1913. The line was double-tracked south of Hakata to Tosu between 1917 and 1921, with Tosu to Hizen Asahi opening 1934, and to Kurume in 1942.

The next section to Araki was double-tracked in 1961, to Kumamoto in 1968 and Yatsushiro in 1970. The Yunoura to Tsunagi section was double-tracked between 1966 and 1968. The line was double-tracked from Kagoshima to Higashichiki between 1969 and 1980.

===Former connecting lines===
The original Kokura to Kurosaki alignment avoided the coastline due to the Japanese army expressing concern at the vulnerability of a coastal route to enemy naval gunfire. A 3 km &quot;Kokura Bypass&quot; line (junctioning 2 km north of Kokura) to the Nippo Main Line was opened in 1903 for the same reason. However, following Japan&#x27;s success in the 1904 Russo-Japanese War, this concern diminished and the Kokura to Kurosaki section was rebuilt (and duplicated) on a new easier (though 3 km longer) alignment to the west of the original line in 1908. The original 11 km section was then renamed the Okura Line and operated until 1911, when it closed together with the Kokura Bypass line.

* Ongagawa Station: An 11 km line to Muroki operated between 1908 and 1985. A 6 km gauge line to Nishiashiya operated from 1915 to 1932. The Ashiya airfield was occupied by the USAF in 1945, and a gauge line was built on the formation of the 762 mm gauge line to serve the airfield in 1947. Trains were mixed (i.e. freight wagons with a passenger car attached) and only available to US military personnel until 1950. The Korean War extended the use of the airfield by the USAF, and the line closed in 1961.
* Yoshizuka Station: A 14 km line to Chikuzenkatsuta opened between 1918 and 1919, hauling coal until the mine closed in 1965. The line closed in 1985.
* Futsukaichi Station: A 26 km light railway to Amagi operated between 1908 and 1940.
* Hainuzuka Station: The 20 km Yabe Line to Kuroki opened as a gauge line in 1903, closing in 1940. The line was rebuilt as a 1,067 mm gauge line in 1945. Freight services ceased in 1978, and the line closed in 1985.
* Setaka Station: A 24 km line to Saga (on the Nagasaki Main Line) opened between 1931 and 1935, and closed in 1987. This line crossed three major watercourses by substantial bridges. The Kyushu Fertiliser Co. operated a 14 km line to Nankan from 1921 until 1938. The 8 km gauge line to Yanagawa line operated from 1911 until 1932.
* Omuta Station: The Mitsui Mining Co. opened a 19 km line to Miike-ko coal mine in 1891. Two branch lines, 4 and 3 km long, were subsequently opened, closing in 1985 and 1969 respectively. Passenger services ceased in 1984. The majority of the system closed in 1997, when the coal fired power stations at Omuta supplied by the line converted to oil, with a 2 km section to Miyaura freight yard remaining to serve a chemical plant.
* Arao Station: A 5 km line to Midorigaoka, electrified at 500 V DC, operated from 1949 until 1964.
* Ueki Station: A 20 km line to Yamaga operated from 1917 until 1965.
* Kamikumamoto: The 22 km gauge Kumamoto Light Railway to Otsu opened between 1907 and 1914, with a 2.4 km branch to Suizenji. Despite proposals to regauge the line to gauge and electrify it, the anticipated development of the area did not occur at an acceptable rate and the line was closed in 1921.
* Minamata Station: The first section of the Yamano line was opened from Kurino (on the Hisatsu Line) 24 km to Yamano in 1921. The 14 km Minamata to Kugino section opened in 1934, and the 10 km Yamano to Satsuma section the following year. In 1937, the 8 km Kugino to Satsuma section, including the Okawa spiral opened. Freight services ceased in 1986, and the line closed in 1988.
* Sendai Station: The Kawamiya Railway commenced construction of a line towards Satsumaoguchi (on the Yamano line) in 1917. Construction was suspended in 1921, and the company was nationalised in 1923. Construction (as the Miyanojo Line) recommenced that year, and the 66 km line opened in stages between 1924 and 1937, closing in 1987.
* Kami Ijuin Station: The Kagoshima Prefectural Government opened a 50 km line to Makurazaki between 1914 and 1931. The JR Ibusuki Makurazaki Line connected when it opened in 1963. The line was closed in 1984 following landslides caused by torrential rain. It had two branch lines: the 16 km Ata to Chiran line opened between 1927 and 1930, and closed by landslides in 1965; and the 3 km Kaseda to Satsuma Man-sei line operated between 1916 and 1962.

<doc id="523369" wikidata="Q728050" url="?curid=523369" title="Nigel Bruce">
<text>William Nigel Ernle Bruce (4 February 1895 – 8 October 1953) was an English character actor on stage and screen. He was best known for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in a series of films and in the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, starring with Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes in both. Bruce is also remembered for his roles in the Alfred Hitchcock films &quot;Rebecca&quot; and &quot;Suspicion&quot;, as well as Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;Limelight&quot; and the original Lassie film &quot;Lassie Come Home&quot;.

==Early life==

Bruce was the second son of Sir William Waller Bruce, 10th Baronet and his wife Angelica, Lady Bruce, daughter of General George Selby, Royal Artillery. He was born in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, whilst his parents were touring the world. His older brother was the author and adventurer Sir Michael Bruce.

He received his formal education at The Grange School in Stevenage, and from 1908 to 1912 at Abingdon School in Abingdon-on-Thames. At Abingdon he was a keen sportsman, playing for the first XI cricket team (for which he received Colours), the athletics&#x27; first team and the school&#x27;s football 2nd XI.

In 1912, Bruce left school at the age of 17, and took up a position as a stockbroker&#x27;s clerk in the City of London. In early 1914, whilst working in the City he voluntarily enlisted in the British Army&#x27;s Territorial Force as an infantry soldier with the Honourable Artillery Company as its Private #852. On the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, he was mobilized with the regiment, and went out to the Western Front with its 1st Battalion on 18 September 1914 at the age of 19. On 5 January 1915, whilst in trenches at Kemmel in Belgium, he was machine-gunned in the legs, causing multiple wounds and a fractured right thigh, and was subsequently medically evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he spent the rest of 1915 recovering in hospital. He was discharged from the British Army as medically unfit for further military service due to permanent damage to his legs in December 1915. In October 1916, he re-enlisted with the British Army and received training with an Officer Cadet Battalion in Cambridge, subsequently receiving a commission in January 1917, as a subaltern with the 10th (Service) Battalion, of the Somerset Light Infantry Regiment, a home service battalion, with which he served as a training officer for the rest of 1917, the permanent infirmity of his 1915 wounds preventing further active service at the front.

==Career==
After being discharged from the British Army, Bruce abandoned a career in the City of London Stock Exchange, and pursued a career as a professional actor. He made his stage debut on 12 May 1920 at London&#x27;s Comedy Theatre as a footman in the play &quot;Why Marry?&quot;. In October of that year, he went to Canada as stage manager to Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore, also playing &quot;Montague Jordan&quot; in &quot;Eliza Comes to Stay&quot;. Upon returning to England, he toured in the same role. He appeared regularly on-stage thereafter, and 8 years later began working in silent films. In 1926 he made his Broadway debut as Major Evelyn Bathurst in Noël Coward &quot;This Was a Man&quot;. He returned to Broadway several times during the 1930s, portraying Philip Downes in Ronald Jeans&#x27;s &quot;Lean Harvest&quot; (1931), Mr. Jelliwell in Benn W. Levy&#x27;s &quot;Springtime for Henry&quot; (1931–1932), His Excellency, Governor of the Colony in Arthur Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Virginia&quot; (1937), and W. S. Gilbert in Oscar Hammerstein II&#x27;s &quot;Knights of Song&quot; (1938). He reprised this final role in the film &quot;Lillian Russell&quot; (1940).

In 1934, he had moved to Hollywood, U.S. As his career there became a success, he set up a home at 701 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills in the latter half of the 1930s.

Bruce typically played buffoonish, fuzzy-minded gentlemen. During his film career, he worked in 78 films, including &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1934), &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), and &quot;Suspicion&quot; (1941).

He appeared in two landmark films: &quot;Becky Sharp&quot; (1935), the first feature film in full Technicolor, and &quot;Bwana Devil&quot; (1952), the first 3-D feature. He uncharacteristically played a detestable figure in &quot;The Rains Came&quot; (1939) which became the first film to win an Oscar for special effects.

==Dr. Watson==

Bruce&#x27;s career signature role was that of Dr. Watson in the 1939–1946 Sherlock Holmes film series, alongside his friend Basil Rathbone playing Holmes. Bruce starred as Watson in all 14 films of the series, and over 200 radio programs of &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Although Watson often appears to be the older of the two main characters, Bruce was three years younger than Rathbone.

Though for most viewers Nigel Bruce formed their vision of Dr Watson, Holmes purists have long objected that the Watson of the books was intelligent and capable (although not an outstanding detective), and that Bruce&#x27;s portrayal made Watson intellectually dimmer and more bumbling than the literary figure. (A nickname resulting from this portrayal was &quot;Boobus Britannicus&quot;.) Loren D. Estleman wrote of Bruce:

Rathbone, however, spoke highly of Bruce&#x27;s portrayal, saying that Watson was one of the screen&#x27;s most lovable characters. The historian David Parkinson wrote that Bruce&#x27;s &quot;avuncular presence provided the perfect counterbalance to Rathbone&#x27;s briskly omniscient sleuth&quot;. Historian Alan Barnes notes that, despite the criticisms against him, Bruce rehabilitated Watson, who had been a marginal figure in the cinematic Holmes canon to that point: &quot;after Bruce, it would be a near-unthinkable heresy to show Holmes without him&quot;. For the radio series, Bruce was allowed to play a more competent version of the character.

The Rathbone-Bruce co-star film series lapsed with the death of its producer-director Roy William Neill in 1946. Since then, most major modern adaptations of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, especially since the 1970s, have consciously defied the popular stereotype, and depicted Watson faithfully as a capable man of action.

==Family==
Bruce was married, from 1921 until his death, to British actress Violet Campbell (née Violet Pauline Shelton) whom he always lovingly called &quot;Bunny&quot;; they had two daughters:

* Jennifer, married in 1944 (divorced in 1946) Jay Gould III, son of Jay Gould II; 
* Pauline, married in 1946 the British flying ace Alan Geoffrey Page.

He was also a second cousin of the Canadian actor Christopher Plummer.

==Later life==
Bruce, known as &quot;Willie&quot; to his friends, was a leading member of the British film colony in Los Angeles, and was captain of the (mostly British) Hollywood Cricket Club. Unlike some of his contemporaries, and along with other British actors such as Basil Rathbone and Charlie Chaplin, Bruce maintained his British citizenship, despite long residence in the United States. He also retained his membership of London&#x27;s Garrick Club and Buck&#x27;s Club until his death. His final film, &quot;World for Ransom&quot;, was released posthumously in 1954.

==Death==
Bruce died of a heart attack, in Santa Monica, California in 1953 at the age of 58. His body was subsequently cremated, with his ashes being placed in a niche at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.

In 1947 he began writing an autobiography entitled &quot;Games, Gossip and Greasepaint&quot;, which is unpublished; however, excerpts have been printed in the &quot;Sherlock Holmes Journal&quot;, and these have been posted online with permission.

<text>The Saltonstall family is a Boston Brahmin family from the U.S. state of Massachusetts, notable for having had a family member attend Harvard University from every generation since Nathaniel Saltonstall—later one of the more principled judges at the Salem Witch Trials—graduated in 1659.

==History==
The Saltonstall family originated in Yorkshire, England, where the name was sometimes spelled Saltingstall. The name originates from the hamlet of Saltonstall in Halifax, West Yorkshire. The meaning is derived from Sal-ton-stall in Old English, the translation being &quot;Farm in the Willows&quot;.

In Harvard University&#x27;s Leverett House Library, there exists a commemorative wooden plaque dedicating the reading room of the library to &quot;ten generations of Saltonstalls, who have matriculated at Harvard 1642–1959.&quot;

At Phillips Exeter Academy, there exists a boathouse erected in William G. Saltonstall&#x27;s honor.

<text>Dorothy Elsie Wilkinson (October 9, 1921 – March 18, 2023) was an American softball player and bowler, who is a member of the halls of fame in both sports.

==Life and career==
Wilkinson played softball from 1933 to 1965, helping her team, the Phoenix Ramblers, to the national title in 1940, 1948, and 1949. She was an All-American nineteen seasons as an amateur softball player. Among her feats, she batted an average of .455 in 1954, .450 in 1955, and .387 on the &quot;Ramblers&quot; championship runner up year of 1957.

As a professional bowler, she won the Women&#x27;s International Bowling Queen&#x27;s Tournament (a bowling triple crown event) in 1962, and the WIBC singles in 1963.

Wilkinson was inducted into the National Softball Hall of Fame and Museum in 1970, her first year of eligibility. She was inducted into the International Bowling Hall of Fame twenty years later, in 1990.

Wilkinson occasionally attended high school, college and tournament softball games in Arizona, where she and some of her former teammates were honored frequently. The Arizona Republic newspaper chose her at number eight among Arizona&#x27;s all-time greatest athletes in 1999.

As of April 2020, Wilkinson was the oldest living member of the Arizona Sports Hall of Fame. She turned 100 in October 2021, and died in Phoenix on March 18, 2023, at the age of 101.

<text>The Agusta A129 Mangusta () is an attack helicopter originally designed and produced by Italian company Agusta. It is the first attack helicopter to be designed and produced wholly in Europe. It has continued to be developed by AgustaWestland, the successor company to Agusta. It has been exclusively operated by the Italian Army, which introduced the type to service during 1990.

The A129 has undergone several combat deployments, seeing use in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. It has proven well suited to operating in hot climates, as well as quite flexible in the field. The original 60 rotorcraft have been upgraded multiple times since entering service with the Italian Army; improvements have included compatibility with additional munitions, new targeting systems, improved avionics, better data-handling, and a more powerful transmission. Various improvements and export models have been proposed, including dedicated naval and reconnaissance variants. The TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK derivative has been developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries in cooperation with AgustaWestland for the Turkish Army as well as other services and export customers. Since 2017, work has been underway on a larger successor to the A129 for the Italian Army, the Leonardo Helicopters AW249.

==Development==

===Origins===

In 1972, the Italian Army began forming a requirement for a light observation and anti-tank helicopter; one prominent factor in shaping this requirement was the need to address the threat posed by the extensive military assets in operation with the Warsaw Pact countries and those of the Soviet Union. Around the same time as the Italian efforts were underway, the West German military had also identified a similar need. The two nations&#x27; parallel requirements ultimately led to a joint project being initiated between the Italian company Agusta and West German company MBB; however, this cooperative effort did not last long, and was dissolved shortly after preliminary work had been undertaken. Agusta had initially studied the development of a combat-oriented derivative of its existing A109 helicopter, however the company decided to proceed with the development of a more ambitious helicopter design.

In 1978, Agusta formally began the design process on what would become the A129. On 11 September 1983, the first of five A129 prototypes made the type&#x27;s maiden flight; the fifth prototype would first fly in March 1986. Around the same time, the Italian Army placed an order for a total of 60 A129s. At one stage, a total of 100 attack helicopters had been planned to be purchased but this was slashed to 60 A129s. Another version of the type was to be capable of hauling eight troops in addition to its firepower capabilities; this variant, referred to sometimes as the &quot;A139&quot;, never got off the ground. According to defence publication Jane&#x27;s Information Group, by 1985, the A129 was considered to be a comparable attack helicopter to the American-built McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache, and showed potential on the export market.

===Export market===
During the 1980s, Agusta sought to partner with Westland Helicopters to develop a common light attack helicopter, other prospective manufacturing participants in the joint initiative included Fokker and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA. In 1986, the governments of Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to investigate an improved version of the A129, alternatively called the Joint European Helicopter &quot;Tonal&quot; or &quot;Light Attack Helicopter&quot; (LAH). By 1988, feasibility studies for four different options had been conducted for the LAH, these would have between 80 per cent and 20 per cent growth over the initial A129; both single-engine and twin-engine configurations were examined using various new powerplants, as well as a new rotor system, retractable landing gear, improved sensors and more powerful armament. However, the LAH project collapsed in 1990 following Britain and the Netherlands independently deciding to withdraw from the program and eventually procure the AH-64 Apache instead.
Agusta retained its interest in pursuing export sales and decided to proceed with the development of the A129 International, or A129I; this was a dedicated and upgraded version of the A129 intended for export customers. The A129I featured a five-bladed main rotor (early production aircraft had employed a four-bladed main rotor), a pair of LHTEC T800 engines (replacing the Rolls-Royce Gem engines of Italian Army Mangustas) and an upgraded transmission; the A129I were also provisioned with new weapons and electronic warfare systems. In 1998, the Italian Army had decided to upgrade a portion of their A129 fleet with many of the A129I&#x27;s systems, the first of the remanufactured helicopters was delivered in 2002. In September 2007, the A129I was formally redesignated as the &quot;AW129&quot;.

During the Australian Army&#x27;s AIR 87 project to procure a new Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter fleet, the Agusta A129 was one of the contenders; it was one of the three attack helicopters, alongside the AH-64 Apache and the Eurocopter Tiger, to be short-listed out of the six tenders submitted. In December 2001, Australia announced its selection of the Eurocopter Tiger as the winning bid.

Turkey had sought a new attack helicopter since the 1990s to replace their diminished Bell AH-1 Cobra and Bell AH-1 SuperCobra fleets. Following a highly protracted selection process, in September 2007, an order was issued for 51 TAI/AgustaWestland T129 ATAK helicopters, a variant of the A129 International. As a part of the deal with AgustaWestland, Turkish defense firm TAI acquired the rights for future manufacturing of the T129; in addition to production for local purposes, TAI also manufacture the T129 for export customers. Various components and avionics systems are intended to be replaced with indigenously produced systems as they are developed.

==Design==
The A129 Mangusta is the first European attack helicopter. As such it has several original aspects to its design, such as being the first helicopter to make use of a fully computerised integrated management system to reduce crew workload. It was decided that much of the helicopter&#x27;s functionality was to be automated; as such, parts of the flight and armament systems are monitored and directly controlled by onboard computers. The A129 shares considerable design similarities to Agusta&#x27;s earlier A109 utility helicopter: the rear section of the A129 was derived from the A109 and incorporated to an entirely new forward section. The A129&#x27;s fuselage is highly angular and armoured for ballistic protection. The composite rotor blades are also able to withstand hits from 23mm cannon fire. The two man crew, comprising a pilot and gunner, sit in a conventional tandem cockpit.

The A129 is able to be operated in various capacities, including to perform anti-armour, armed reconnaissance, ground attack, escort, fire support and anti-aircraft missions. For the anti-ground mission the helicopter may employ a combination of various armaments, including up to eight Hellfire missiles; By 2014, the Spike-ER, a fourth-generation anti-tank missile, had been added to the A129&#x27;s arsenal. In the air-to-air role, the Mistral missile could be equipped; furthermore, the FIM-92 Stinger missile was certified for use in 2003. The A129 can also be equipped with 81 mm or 70 mm (2.75 in) unguided rockets housed in pods as well as 12.7mm machine gun pods; later models also feature a M197 three-barrel 20 mm cannon that is installed onto a nose-mounted Oto Melara TM-197B turret.
Power is provided by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem 2-1004D turboshaft engines. Features of this engine includes automatic engine management and simplified controls for ease of operation, along with a relatively brief start-up interval and a comparatively low specific fuel consumption. Newer variants benefit from improvements such as an improved transmission. One key feature present on the engines is the incorporation of infrared suppressors, which act to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s heat signature and thereby improve survivability. One of the key protective measures incorporated onto the A129 include the electronic warfare and SIAP (Single Integrated Air Picture) self-protection suite. Elements of the mission interface systems and the onboard software integrated onto later aircraft were produced by Selex Galileo.

The A129 is equipped with infrared night vision systems and is capable of operating at day or night in all-weather conditions. Laser systems are fitted onto newer aircraft for range-finding and target designation purposes, the A129 can laser-designate targets for other friendly aircraft to attack. On the AW129D, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems&#x27;s Toplite III sight is used as the primary targeting system; it is able to act as a FLIR and has both manual and automatic target tracking modes, Toplite also provides a greater detection and identification range than the 1970s era HeliTOW sensor it replaced. In 1998, Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) formally partnered with Agusta to offer various avionics and weapons upgrades to potential A129 operators; various IAI technologies have since been proposed and implemented on Italian A129s.

==Operational history==

The Italian Army would receive a total of 60 A129 helicopters, deliveries of the type began in 1990. In 1999, AgustaWestland received a contract to produce the last batch of 15 A129s to the new combat CBT configuration; in late 2001, the Italian Army opted to have all of their A129s retrofitted to the improved A129 CBT standard. In 2011, AgustaWestland was part-way through modifying a total of 24 A129s to the new ARH-129D aerial reconnaissance standard, as well as the manufacturing of a further 24 new-built ARH-129Ds for the Italian Army.

In Italian service, the Mangusta has successfully deployed on several United Nations missions in nations such as the Republic of Macedonia, Somalia and Angola. The A-129 proved to be suitable in the peacekeeping role and well-suited to operations in hot climates; the type was reported to have been highly reliable and extremely flexible during the deployment to Somalia.

Three A129 helicopters were deployed in Iraq to provide air support for the Italian forces in Nassiriya. Several A129s have also been stationed in Afghanistan to support in-theatre operations by Italian and allied forces. In November 2014, the latest variant of the A129, the AW-129D, was deployed to Afghanistan for the first time.

In January 2015, the Italian Army opted for an enhancement package their existing A129s. These upgrades, which are to enter service prior to 2020, largely focused on increasing the A129&#x27;s endurance, speed, situational awareness, and information-handling capabilities; other goals included a reduction in pilot workload and integrating the aircraft with future tactical UAVs. A revealed alternative that was considered and rejected was the replacement of the type with an attack-orientated variant of the newer AgustaWestland AW149 helicopter, upgrading the existing A129s was considered to be less risky and time-consuming. However, on 17 January 2017, it was announced that Italy had signed a €487 million ($515 million) contract with Leonardo for the development of a dedicated successor to the A129, the Leonardo Helicopters AW249; this shall incorporate numerous mature systems present on the A129.

In March 2016, the Italian government announced that it was deploying four A129 attack helicopters and four NHIndustries NH90 transport helicopters along with 130 personnel to the Kurdistan region of Iraq to perform combat search and rescue mission as part of a multinational effort to help combat Islamic State militants within the region and specifically to protect the Mosul Dam.

By 2018, it was reported that the total number of A129s still operational had fallen to 32.
