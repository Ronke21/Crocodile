<text>Kurt Thomas Busch (born August 4, 1978) is an American auto racing driver. He is best known for competing in the NASCAR Cup Series from 2000–2022, last driving the No. 45 Toyota Camry TRD for 23XI Racing. Busch is the 2004 NASCAR Cup Series champion and the 2017 Daytona 500 winner. He is the older brother of two-time Cup Series champion Kyle Busch.

Busch began his NASCAR Cup Series career in 2000, driving for teams including Chip Ganassi Racing, Stewart–Haas Racing, Furniture Row Racing, Phoenix Racing, Penske Racing, and Roush Racing. He has won 34 Cup races and claimed the championship in the inaugural &quot;Chase for the Cup&quot; points format. In 2006, he joined an elite group of 36 drivers to win races in all three of NASCAR&#x27;s top divisions: the Cup Series, Xfinity Series, and Camping World Truck Series. Early in his career, Busch gained attention for his aggressive driving and clashes with competitors, team members, and the media. Over time, he became known for helping his teams enhance their programs. He is the only driver to win Cup races with four manufacturers: Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet, and Toyota.

Beyond stock car racing, Busch has competed in the Indianapolis 500, the 24 Hours of Daytona, and the National Hot Rod Association. In 2023, he was named one of NASCAR&#x27;s 75 Greatest Drivers.

== Racing career ==

=== Beginnings ===
Busch began his racing career at age 14 in a Dwarf car at Pahrump Valley Speedway, introduced to the sport by his father. He also competed in IMCA Modified racing early in his career.

Busch&#x27;s big break came under unfortunate circumstances when Chris Trickle, a promising driver, was critically injured in an unsolved shooting and later passed away. Trickle&#x27;s No. 70 team, sponsored by Star Nursery, sought a replacement driver, giving Busch the opportunity to step in. He gained national attention in the 1997 Winter Heat Series at Tucson Speedway, competing against notable drivers like Ron Hornaday Jr., Matt Crafton, Greg Biffle, and Kevin Harvick.

In 1998, Busch won Rookie of the Year in the NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Southwest Series, and went on to secure the series championship in 1999. His success earned him a spot in the Roush Racing &quot;Gong Show,&quot; where he won a Craftsman Truck Series ride. Driving the No. 99 Ford F-150, Busch achieved four victories, finished second in the championship standings to teammate Greg Biffle, and was named Rookie of the Year.

==== Roush Racing ====

===== 2000–2005 =====

Roush Racing announced during the 2000 season that Busch would be promoted to the Winston Cup Series for 2001, replacing Chad Little in the No. 97 Ford. Little was released early, allowing Busch to take over the No. 97 John Deere-sponsored Ford at Dover in September 2000. Busch competed in seven of the final eight races that season, with Jeff Hammond as his crew chief, while Little drove at Talladega. Busch&#x27;s best finish during this stint was 13th place at Charlotte.

Busch began the 2001 season driving an unsponsored car after John Deere ended its sponsorship of the No. 97 car following 2000. Later that year, Roush Racing secured a multi-year deal with Rubbermaid, with its Sharpie marker brand becoming Busch&#x27;s primary sponsor. Busch recorded three top-five finishes and six top-10 finishes during the season. In the 2001 Daytona 500, Busch had a notable encounter with Dale Earnhardt. On lap 85, the two made door-to-door contact, prompting Earnhardt to flash Busch a middle-finger gesture at . The moment, captured by Fox Sports replay cameras, led broadcaster Mike Joy to comment, &quot;Kurt, you&#x27;re number one.&quot; Reflecting on the incident, Busch described it as his only on-track interaction with Earnhardt, who tragically died in a crash on the race&#x27;s final lap. Busch remains the last active driver to have raced against Earnhardt in the Cup Series.

Busch secured his best finish of the season with a third-place result at the spring Talladega race, just three weeks after earning his first career Top 5 at Texas (fourth). He also claimed a fifth-place finish in the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. However, his season was marred by misfortune, particularly in the second half. At the Southern 500 in Darlington, he led 74 laps before crashing out. At Martinsville, he led 38 laps but suffered a cut tire in heavy traffic, causing significant damage. At Rockingham, overheating issues hindered his performance despite leading 45 laps. He also failed to qualify for the penultimate race in Atlanta. Busch wrapped up the season with a 21st-place finish at the postponed race in New Hampshire, ending 27th in points and second to Kevin Harvick in the Rookie of the Year standings.

The 2002 season marked Busch&#x27;s breakout year in the Winston Cup Series. He secured his first victory at the Food City 500 in Bristol, outdueling Jimmy Spencer on worn tires. Busch went on to win at Martinsville in October, Atlanta the following week, and the season finale at Homestead, totaling four wins. He also achieved 12 top-five finishes, 20 top-10 finishes, and one pole position, earning third place in the final standings and 5,105,394 in prize money. Busch dominated the end of the season, winning three of the final five races and leading laps in the other two. He became the first driver in NASCAR history to win the most races in his first winning season, a record later matched by Carl Edwards in 2005.

Busch had a mixed season in 2003. He secured four wins, including a season sweep at Bristol, becoming the first driver to achieve this since Rusty Wallace in 2000. Despite these victories, inconsistent performances later in the year caused him to fall out of the Top 10 in points, finishing 11th overall with nine Top 5 finishes and 14 Top 10s. However, he earned over 5 million for the season. Busch also played a role in NASCAR history during the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington on March 16. In the closing laps, he and Ricky Craven battled intensely for the lead, both wrestling with loose cars. Busch held the lead entering the final corner, but Craven drew nearly even exiting Turn 4. The two cars repeatedly made contact as they raced to the finish line. Craven edged Busch by just .002 seconds, marking the closest finish in NASCAR history at the time.

In 2004, Busch won three races, earned two poles, and captured the inaugural NASCAR Nextel Cup Championship, the first season to feature &quot;The Chase for the Championship.&quot; He achieved his fourth consecutive win at Bristol by taking the Food City 500 in March, marking his third straight victory in that event. Busch also became the second driver to sweep both races at New Hampshire Motor Speedway in a single season. However, the championship almost slipped away during the final race at Homestead. On lap 93, Busch reported a flat right-front tire and entered the access road leading to pit road. As he approached the pits, the wheel came off his car, causing him to veer sharply left and narrowly avoid hitting the yellow barrels at the pit road entrance. If he had struck the barrels, his championship hopes would have been over. The loose wheel brought out a caution, but Busch recovered, regained his positions, and secured the title. He ended the season with 10 top-five finishes and 21 top-10 finishes.

In 2005, midway through the season, Busch announced that he would be leaving Roush Racing at the end of the year to replace Rusty Wallace in the No. 2 Miller Lite-sponsored Dodge for Penske Racing South. Initially, Roush was upset with Busch&#x27;s decision, but the situation changed when Chip Ganassi Racing revealed that Jamie McMurray wanted to join Roush Racing in 2006. As a result, Roush agreed to release Busch. Although Busch had asked team owner Jack Roush to let him out of his contract at the end of 2005, Roush initially refused. However, when it became clear that Busch had already signed a contract with Roger Penske, Roush decided to let him go. Busch&#x27;s final race with Roush Racing was at Texas, after which he was sidelined for the last two races of the season due to a NASCAR suspension following an incident with the police. Busch had a strong 2005 season, winning three races, earning nine Top 5 finishes, and 18 Top 10 finishes in 34 races. He also posted an average finish of 15.3, which helped him secure 10th place in the final points standings.

==== Penske Racing ====

===== 2006–2011 =====

In the 2006 season, driving for Penske, Busch won the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway, his fifth win at the track. He celebrated by making a snow angel on the track due to snow that weekend. Busch also secured six poles, seven Top 5 finishes, and 12 Top 10 finishes, but ended the season 16th in the standings. He made his Busch Series debut for Penske in the No. 39 Dodge at Texas, winning in his first race. Busch added a second win at Watkins Glen by holding off Robby Gordon on the final lap. He compared the battle to his 2003 Darlington finish against Ricky Craven, where he lost by just an inch. Busch missed the Chase for the first time in 2006.

In the 2007 season, Busch secured two wins, one pole, five Top 5 finishes, and 10 Top 10 finishes over 26 races, earning a spot in the Chase for the Sprint Cup. His on-track performance improved significantly after Pat Tryson joined as his crew chief midway through the season. Additionally, Busch competed in four more Busch Series races, achieving two Top 5 finishes and three Top 10 finishes.

In 2008, to guarantee rookie Sam Hornish Jr. a starting spot in the first five races, points from Busch&#x27;s No. 2 car were transferred to Hornish&#x27;s No. 77. Busch was still assured a spot due to NASCAR’s Champion’s Provisional Rule, which automatically qualifies the most recent series champion—Busch, with his 2004 title—if they&#x27;re not in the top 35 of owner points. During the 2008 Daytona 500, Busch had a fast car and was in contention for the win. On the final lap, he pushed teammate Ryan Newman past Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Tony Stewart and Kyle Busch, allowing Newman to win. It was Penske’s first Daytona 500 victory and made him one of the few owners to win both the Indianapolis 500 and Daytona 500. On June 29, 2008, Busch broke a 29-race winless streak with a rain-shortened victory at New Hampshire, his first win since Michigan in 2007 and 18th career win. Despite the victory, Busch missed the Chase and finished 18th in points.

Busch began his 2009 season at the Daytona 500, where he was involved in a wreck on lap 124 when Dale Earnhardt Jr. swerved into Brian Vickers. Vickers hit the wall, ricocheted into Denny Hamlin, who then collided with Busch. Kurt spun into the grass with eight other drivers, including his brother Kyle. After multiple pit stops, he finished 10th. Busch, along with others, believed Earnhardt&#x27;s contact was intentional and called for a penalty, but NASCAR did not penalize him. Busch qualified 4th for the next race at Auto Club Speedway, finishing 5th, which moved him up to 3rd in the standings. He dominated the 2009 Kobalt Tools 500, leading 235 of 325 laps and securing his 19th Sprint Cup victory. At Las Vegas, he shared a touching moment with his brother Kyle after Kyle’s win, with Darrell Waltrip calling it &quot;the most touching thing I have ever seen.&quot; Kurt remained in the top 5 for the rest of the season, qualified for the Chase, and finished 4th, the highest-ranked driver not with Hendrick Motorsports. He earned another victory at the 2009 Dickies 500 after Kyle ran out of fuel with two laps to go.

In 2010, Steve Addington became Busch&#x27;s crew chief after two seasons with Kyle Busch, where he helped secure 14 wins. Addington replaced Pat Tryson, who left to join Michael Waltrip Racing. On May 22, 2010, Kurt won the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race and followed it with a victory in the Coca-Cola 600, becoming just the seventh driver to win both in the same year. Busch made the Chase, seeded fifth in points, and finished an impressive seventh at Daytona in the Coke Zero 400 despite three wrecks in the final 12 laps. He finished 11th in the Chase standings.

In 2011, Busch and Keselowski swapped teams. Busch took over the renumbered No. 22 Dodge. He won his first Budweiser Shootout after Denny Hamlin went below the yellow line at Daytona, followed by a victory in the Gatorade Duel 1. Due to Dale Earnhardt Jr.&#x27;s crash in practice, Busch started first in the 2011 Daytona 500, making it three wins in a row to start the season. During the Crown Royal 400 at Richmond, Busch launched a profanity-laced tirade on his in-car radio, seemingly directed at Penske technical director Tom German.

Busch won the pole and dominated the race at Kansas by leading 152 laps, but a late fuel pickup issue cost him a victory, which went to his teammate Brad Keselowski. On June 26, Busch secured his first road course win at Infineon Raceway, leading 76 laps. After Keselowski was injured in a practice crash at Road Atlanta, Busch filled in for him at the Zippo 200 at Watkins Glen International, where he claimed the pole and won the race. By August 13, 2011, Busch had won 25% of his Nationwide Series starts. On October 2, he earned his first victory at Dover&#x27;s Monster Mile, leading the final 43 laps after two late restarts and beating Jimmie Johnson. This would ultimately be his last win for Penske Racing. The season ended on a sour note as Busch struggled in the final five races. Tensions peaked when he verbally attacked an ESPN cameraman and made an obscene gesture after a transmission failure during the season finale. Crew chief Steve Addington departed for Stewart–Haas Racing following the 2011 season.

===== First media incidents and release =====
During the post-race interview at the fall Richmond race, Busch made headlines with his fiery behavior. On ABC, Busch claimed he was &quot;in [Johnson&#x27;s] head.&quot; The situation escalated after the race when NASCAR.com reporter Joe Menzer asked Busch if either he or Johnson could win the Chase. Busch, visibly agitated, interrupted Menzer, saying, &quot;How did I see you were going to come with that? We’re good,&quot; before attempting to walk away. However, the exchange took a turn when Busch shouted expletives and physically confronted Menzer, prompting Penske team members to restrain him. Later, during a press conference, AP journalist Jenna Fryer asked Johnson about Busch&#x27;s comment from the ABC interview. Busch interjected, denying he made the statement, saying, &quot;I didn&#x27;t say that tonight. Did not.&quot; Fryer offered to show him the transcript, which Busch reviewed after the interview. In a dramatic gesture, Busch tore up the transcript and left the media center. Busch later apologized to both Menzer and Fryer for his conduct.

At the start of the Sylvania 300 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Busch&#x27;s team faced a delay in rolling their car to pit road due to a pre-race inspection issue. The rear-end housing was found to be outside of allowable tolerances, causing the setback. As ESPN reporter Jamie Little approached Busch to ask a question, he responded curtly, expressing frustration: &quot;Why the fuck do you think I would be OK? I gotta go get in my car. NASCAR told me I gotta get in my car.&quot;

During the final race of the 2011 season, Busch&#x27;s transmission failed on the third lap. While his car was being repaired, Busch verbally abused Dr. Jerry Punch, who was waiting to interview him for ESPN. The incident, captured by a fan and posted on YouTube, drew widespread criticism. NASCAR fined Busch 50,000 for his conduct, and Penske Racing issued an apology for his &quot;inappropriate actions.&quot; Later, during Championship Week, Busch addressed the incident, revealing that he had been working with a sports psychologist for two months to address personal issues. He acknowledged the need to improve his behavior, stating, &quot;I need to be a better person on the radio, to the team, as a leader. It&#x27;s personal issues, of course, and working with a sports psychologist, I&#x27;ve gotten obviously a small grasp, but there are obviously bigger things that I need to accomplish and things can&#x27;t happen overnight&quot;.

On December 5, 2011, Busch&#x27;s employment with Penske Racing ended. While both parties described the separation as mutual, many observers believed he was fired. According to &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, multiple sources confirmed that team owner Roger Penske made the decision after Busch&#x27;s altercation at Homestead-Miami Speedway, viewing it as the final incident in a tumultuous tenure. The announcement was reportedly delayed until after Champion&#x27;s Week. A. J. Allmendinger was named as his replacement in the No. 22 car.

==== Phoenix Racing ====

===== 2012: Second winless season =====

After his release from Penske Racing, Busch acknowledged that he was no longer &quot;having fun&quot; with racing and decided to seek therapy for his anger issues while focusing on restoring his enjoyment of the sport. Busch declined an offer from Richard Petty Motorsports and instead opted for an early-season agreement to drive the No. 51 Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing in the 2012 Sprint Cup Series season. He also explored potential opportunities with Michael Waltrip Racing, Furniture Row Racing, and Richard Childress Racing. Additionally, Busch competed in a limited Nationwide Series schedule with Phoenix Racing. During this time, Busch also established a sponsorship deal with Monster Energy. Through this partnership, he signed on with Kyle Busch Motorsports to share the No. 54 car in the Nationwide Series with his younger brother, Kyle Busch.

At the 2012 Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega, Busch paid tribute to the 2006 racing comedy &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; by running his No. 51 car in the paint scheme of Ricky Bobby&#x27;s No. 62 &quot;ME&quot; Cougar car from the film. NASCAR on Fox commentators Mike Joy, Larry McReynolds, and Darrell Waltrip jokingly referred to Busch as &quot;Ricky Bobby&quot; throughout the race, while Busch quoted lines from the movie over team radio. Busch spent months securing permission from Sony, Will Ferrell, and other rights holders to use the design. Notably, parallels were drawn between Busch&#x27;s real-life struggles during the 2011–12 Sprint Cup offseason and Ricky Bobby&#x27;s fictional fall from grace. Busch&#x27;s car performed well, running near the front and leading a few laps. However, with six laps remaining, he spun out in the trioval after contact with former teammate Brad Keselowski. After stopping, Busch drove backward down pit road to get new tires. Despite the unconventional move, he avoided penalties and finished 20th, the last car on the lead lap.

At Darlington, Busch collided with Ryan Newman, ending both drivers&#x27; races. Busch was fined 50,000 and placed on a five-race probation, while Newman received no penalty. Busch ultimately finished 21st, the last car on the lead lap.

On June 4, 2012, Busch clashed with Justin Allgaier during the Nationwide event at Dover. Later, in an interview with reporter Bob Pockrass, Busch was asked about his probation. He responded, &quot;It refrains me from not beating the shit out of you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I&#x27;m on probation, I suppose that&#x27;s improper to say as well. If you can talk about racing things, we&#x27;ll talk about many things, Bob. It is not racing, you&#x27;re here just to start stuff, you know that&#x27;s you&#x27;re all out here for!&quot;  As a result of this outburst, NASCAR immediately suspended Busch from the Pocono race, citing a violation of its policy against public profanity. NASCAR later extended his suspension until June 13, 2012, and lengthened his probation through December 31. Busch had already been on probation for a prior incident involving Ryan Newman&#x27;s team at the May 12 Sprint Cup race at Darlington, where he was cited for reckless driving through Newman&#x27;s pit stall.  According to a NASCAR news release, Busch was suspended for violating Section 12-1 of the rulebook, which prohibits &quot;actions detrimental to stock car racing,&quot; including &quot;violation of probation&quot; and &quot;verbal abuse of a media member.&quot;

On July 6, 2012, Busch won the Nationwide Series Jalapeño 250 at Daytona, overtaking Austin Dillon on the final lap.

During his 7-8 month stint with James Finch, he finished third at Sonoma after leading several laps and running in the top three throughout the race. However, his closest near-miss occurred at Talladega that fall. Busch led early and midway through the race but spun out after contact with Jamie McMurray. He was parked by NASCAR after driving away from safety officials who were trying to assist him, refusing to stop his car despite NASCAR’s instructions. The following week, he began driving for Furniture Row Racing.

==== Furniture Row Racing ====

===== 2012 =====
On September 24, 2012, it was announced that Busch would drive the No. 78 Chevrolet SS for Furniture Row Racing in the 2013 season, replacing Regan Smith. The opportunity arose when then-crew chief Todd Berrier reached out to Busch to gauge his interest in joining FRR. Busch made his debut for the team at the 2012 Bank of America 500, finishing 21st. He followed that with a 25th-place finish at Kansas. However, he rebounded with three consecutive Top 10 finishes at Texas, Phoenix, and Homestead to close out the season. Despite the strong finish, Busch missed the Chase for the first time since 2008 and ended the year 25th in the points standings.

===== 2013: Return to The Chase =====

The 2013 season for Busch began similarly to 2012, as he joined a new team, Furniture Row Racing (FRR). However, Busch showed notable improvement over his challenging 2012 season, both individually and with FRR. His start to the year was rough, as he crashed during the Sprint Unlimited on lap 14, finishing 13th. He placed fifth in the Budweiser Duel but struggled with handling issues, leading to a 28th-place finish in the Daytona 500, five laps down. His performance didn’t improve much at Phoenix, where he finished 27th, one lap down. He then placed 20th at Las Vegas. After these less successful finishes, Busch bounced back with a strong performance, securing a fourth-place finish at Bristol.

At Fontana, Busch briefly went a lap down due to a penalty for speeding during green-flag pit stops but rallied in the final laps to finish third, behind his brother Kyle and Dale Earnhardt Jr. At Martinsville, Busch&#x27;s luck soured. After an early crash and a successful lucky dog pass, he lost his brakes on lap 487 while running many laps down and hit the wall hard, causing his engine to catch fire. The incident led to a 6-minute red flag, but Busch was uninjured.

At Texas, Busch nearly secured the pole position with a qualifying speed of . However, his younger brother, Kyle, ultimately claimed the pole with a speed of , closing out the qualifying session. Busch started second, still on the front row, but expressed disappointment at losing the pole, saying, &quot;I would rather lose to Kyle than anybody else... it is frustrating that I do lose it to him though.&quot;

At Richmond, Busch led for 36 laps and was a contender for the win. However, after a late restart, he collided with Tony Stewart, bumping him out of the top ten. Post-race, the two exchanged shoves and argued on pit road, overshadowing Kevin Harvick&#x27;s victory. Both were called to the NASCAR hauler. Busch finished ninth and stated he didn’t intentionally hit Stewart and was surprised by Stewart’s retaliation. At Talladega, Busch led two laps and was in the top ten when he was caught in a massive wreck on lap 182. J. J. Yeley, after contact with Ricky Stenhouse Jr., hit Busch, causing him to flip and land on Ryan Newman before striking the wall and getting hit by Clint Bowyer and Bobby Labonte. Busch was unharmed.

At Darlington, Busch earned his first pole of the season and led 69 of the first 80 laps. However, his handling deteriorated after the green flag pit stops, and he finished 14th. In the All-Star race, Busch led 29 laps and won two of the four 20-lap segments, with his brother Kyle winning the other two. A poor pit stop for both Busch brothers cost them the lead, and Kurt finished fifth in the final ten-lap shootout, won by Jimmie Johnson.

At the Coca-Cola 600 a week later, Busch started second, on the outside of the front row. Despite having to change a battery late in the race, he led eight laps and finished third, marking his first top-three finish since June 2012 at Sonoma. When interviewed, he said, &quot;Yeah, a top-five is great. To be up front, to lead laps, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. So we&#x27;ll get these little hiccups polished up and continue plugging forward. That&#x27;s the only thing we can do, is learn from what exactly happened – was it a cable issue, a battery that was dead, was the alternator not charging? To show our strength tonight, to finish third, we&#x27;ll take it. I think that&#x27;s what needs to be said. The Furniture Row team was fast, and we didn&#x27;t quite have a perfect night, and we brought it home third.&quot;

Busch earned a 12th-place finish at Dover and a seventh-place result at Pocono. At Michigan, he qualified on the front row and led the first 21 laps, but fell seven laps down after an early accident on lap 30. At Sonoma, Busch secured his next top-five finish with a fourth-place result, after leading 15 laps and recovering from a lap down following two speeding penalties on pit road.

At Kentucky, Busch was involved in a controversy on lap 48 when he caused a seven-car wreck. He went down to the apron, then came back up and turned Keselowski into turn 1, triggering a crash that also involved Greg Biffle, Travis Kvapil, and Dave Blaney. Busch finished sixth and followed that with another sixth-place finish at the Coke Zero 400, marking Furniture Row Racing&#x27;s first-ever streak of three consecutive top-ten finishes. This moved Busch up to ninth in points. However, at Loudon the next week, Busch started second, led 102 laps, but was turned and wrecked by Matt Kenseth, finishing 31st.

At Indianapolis, Busch finished in 14th place. The following week at Pocono, he led nine laps and secured a third-place finish. He then earned a ninth-place finish at Watkins Glen. Back at Michigan, Busch started on the outside of the front row, led 43 laps, and finished third, moving up to ninth in the driver points standings.

At Bristol in August, Busch started from the outside row and led 54 laps early. However, a loose wheel forced him behind the wall, resulting in a 31st-place finish, 26 laps down. He rebounded in the next two weeks, finishing fourth at Atlanta. The following week at Richmond, Busch started second and had one of the strongest cars of the night, ultimately finishing second to Carl Edwards. This also marked Furniture Row Racing&#x27;s first-ever appearance in the Chase.

At Chicagoland, Busch began the Chase with a fourth-place finish. He then finished 13th at New Hampshire and 21st at Dover after pitting for a loose wheel. At Kansas, Busch had to start at the rear of the field due to a practice crash that required a backup car. Despite the setback, he worked his way through the pack to finish second. This marked his tenth top-five and fifteenth top-ten finishes in 30 races. Busch ultimately finished tenth in the final standings.

In 2013, Busch was scheduled to drive the No. 1 Chevrolet for Phoenix Racing in the Nationwide Series, with plans to compete in sixteen events. However, he participated in only three races that season. He wrecked at Daytona but achieved top-ten finishes at Talladega and in the second race at Daytona.

==== Stewart-Haas Racing ====
On August 26, 2013, Kurt Busch announced his departure from Furniture Row Racing to join Stewart–Haas Racing under a multi-year contract. Team co-owner Gene Haas confirmed he would fully sponsor Busch&#x27;s ride. By late September, it was revealed that Busch&#x27;s car would carry the No. 41.

===== 2014: Return to Victory Lane =====

Busch had a breakout performance for his new team at Fontana. He took the lead late in the race after Jimmie Johnson blew a tire with seven laps to go. On the restart, Busch led against his teammate Tony Stewart but lost the top spot on the final lap when Kyle Busch slipped past to claim the victory.  

The following week at the STP 500, Busch found himself in a controversial moment on lap 43. During a caution, he collided with Keselowski on pit road, causing significant damage to Keselowski&#x27;s car. After repairs, Keselowski returned to the track, leading to several heated on-track exchanges between the two drivers. In the final stages of the race, Busch engaged in a thrilling battle with Jimmie Johnson for the lead. With 11 laps to go, Busch overtook Johnson and held on to secure his first win since 2011 and his first victory at Martinsville since 2002.

At Darlington, with just three laps to go and running in the top five, Busch was tapped from behind by Clint Bowyer, causing him to spin and crash head-on into a barrier. Thanks to energy-absorbing walls, Busch escaped uninjured. However, under caution, he waved angrily at Bowyer and expressed his frustration during the post-race ceremonies. Reflecting on the incident, Busch stated: &quot;That was a terrible way to end what could have been a decent night. We struggled at times to get the balance of the Haas Automation Chevrolet right, but we kind of found our spot just past the halfway point and made slight adjustments the rest of the way. We called for a two-tire stop at the end hoping to gain some track position, but it seemed like everyone had the same idea. We gained a little, but the guys behind us all had four tires. I tried to hold them off the best I could, but someone (Bowyer) moved me out of their way and it ruined our night. I hate it for the team, but we keep learning each week and we will get better.&quot;

At the 2014 Coca-Cola 600, Busch attempted to complete all 1,100 miles of the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. However, his effort fell 194 miles short when his engine failed on lap 274, leaving him with 271 of the 400 laps completed.

At Pocono, Busch qualified third and led five laps during the race. He consistently ran in the top five throughout the day and secured a third-place finish, his best result since winning at Martinsville.

At Daytona, Busch qualified 42nd but managed to lead the most laps during the race. However, on lap 111, Aric Almirola passed him. Just five laps later, rain began soaking the speedway, and the race was called off on lap 116. In a post-race interview, a disappointed Busch stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do my job. Third is good, but I wanted to win.&quot; Following the race, Busch was penalized 10 points, and crew chief Daniel Knost was fined 10,000 due to an illegal window component that had been inadvertently installed before the race. Busch chose not to appeal the penalty.

After the Daytona race, Busch&#x27;s performance improved significantly. He secured top-five finishes at both Pocono and Watkins Glen. Midway through the Chase, Knost stepped down as Busch&#x27;s crew chief and was replaced by Tony Gibson. With Gibson&#x27;s guidance, Busch&#x27;s performance further improved, consistently qualifying in the top ten for the remaining races. His best finishes during the Chase were two seventh-place results, achieved at Talladega and Phoenix.

===== 2015 =====

Busch began his 2015 season on a rough note during the Sprint Unlimited, where he was involved in two multi-car accidents. In the second Budweiser Duel, he was running in second place behind Jimmie Johnson with nine laps remaining. However, Busch accidentally drove below the yellow line, which improved his position. As a result, officials issued a stop-and-go penalty, sending him to the back of the field for the final standings.

On February 20, 2015, NASCAR indefinitely suspended Busch following a Delaware family court&#x27;s finding that it was &quot;more likely than not&quot; he had abused his ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll. Regan Smith replaced Busch for the Daytona 500 as well as the races in Atlanta and Las Vegas. Busch applied for reinstatement ten days after the Daytona 500 and began participating in NASCAR&#x27;s reinstatement program.

On March 11, 2015, NASCAR lifted Busch&#x27;s indefinite suspension after Delaware prosecutors determined there was insufficient evidence for a criminal case. He was cleared to race again, starting with the CampingWorld.com 500 at Phoenix. NASCAR also granted Busch a waiver, allowing him to remain eligible for the Chase if he won a race before the Richmond event in the fall. In his first race back, Busch finished fifth. At Auto Club, he won the pole, led 65 laps, but finished third after a last-lap pass by Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick.

The following week at Martinsville, Busch led early in the race but dropped to the back of the field midway through. He was briefly penalized for changing lanes before a restart, but 20 laps later, officials rescinded the penalty. Busch then dominated at Richmond, where he battled Jamie McMurray for the win in the final 100 laps. Busch pulled away to claim his first victory of the season.

Busch&#x27;s second win of the season came in a rain-shortened race at Michigan. At Sonoma, he dominated early but finished second to his younger brother Kyle, marking their first-ever 1-2 finish in NASCAR Sprint Cup history. Despite missing the first three races of the season, Busch finished 8th in the 2015 championship standings, with 21 top-10 finishes and 3 poles.

===== 2016 =====

Busch began the 2016 season with a 10th-place finish in the Daytona 500 and two consecutive pole wins at Atlanta and Las Vegas. However, he received the pole at Atlanta due to his brother Kyle Busch&#x27;s time being disqualified after failing post-qualifying inspection. His only win of the season came at Pocono, coincidentally when his crew chief Gibson was suspended. Busch had a consistent season, setting a record for the most consecutive lead-lap finishes to start the year. His streak ended with his first DNF at Bristol after contact with Joey Logano. He finished 7th in the championship standings.

===== 2017: Daytona 500 Win =====

Stewart-Haas Racing switched to Ford for the 2017 season, a manufacturer that hadn&#x27;t won a Cup championship since Busch&#x27;s 2004 title with Roush. Busch&#x27;s season started with a crash in the Advance Auto Parts Clash after Jimmie Johnson spun. A week later, Busch won the Daytona 500, passing Kyle Larson on the final lap. However, Busch struggled for the rest of the year, finishing 14th in the standings with 6 Top-5s, 14 Top-10s, and 7 DNFs.

===== 2018: Final season at Stewart-Haas =====

In the summer of 2017, Busch and Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) struggled to finalize a contract renewal, with SHR not picking up his option. Despite this, Busch and SHR agreed to a one-year deal for 2018. He started the season strong with pole positions at Texas, Michigan, and New Hampshire. Busch won his first race in 58 races at Bristol night race, securing a spot in the 2018 Playoffs. He advanced to the Round of 8 before being eliminated at Phoenix after a late crash with Denny Hamlin and Chase Elliott. Busch finished the season seventh in points. On December 2, 2018, he announced he would not return to SHR in 2019.

==== Chip Ganassi Racing ====

===== 2019 =====

On December 4, 2018, it was confirmed that Busch and his sponsor, Monster Energy, would join Chip Ganassi Racing, driving the No. 1 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 for the 2019 season. Busch signed a one-year deal, leading many to believe that this would be his final full-time season in NASCAR.

At the Pennzoil 400, Busch’s No. 1 car was sponsored by Star Nursery, with a livery inspired by his first NASCAR win in the AutoZone Elite Division. He finished second to his brother Kyle at the 2019 Food City 500, marking their second 1–2 finish. Busch secured his first win with Chip Ganassi Racing (CGR) at Kentucky, defeating Kyle on the final restart. This was the third 1–2 finish for the Busch brothers, but the first time Kurt won. Despite making the playoffs, Kurt was eliminated in the Round of 16 after a 20th-place finish at the Charlotte Roval. On November 2, 2019, CGR confirmed Kurt would stay with the No. 1 team for at least two more years.

===== 2020 =====
Busch made the 2020 playoffs without a victory, relying on consistency with four top-five finishes and 14 top-10 finishes. He secured his first win of the season, and 32nd career victory, at Las Vegas, which earned him a spot in the Round of 8.

===== 2021 =====

Busch started 2021 with 1 top-five and 2 top-10 finishes in the first three races, but his results declined until a 6th-place finish at Sonoma in race 16, sparking a streak of three consecutive top-eight finishes. On June 30, Justin Marks, co-founder of Trackhouse Racing, announced he had acquired Chip Ganassi Racing&#x27;s NASCAR operations, making Busch a free agent after the season. On July 11, Kurt won the Quaker State 400 at Atlanta, holding off his brother Kyle, securing a playoff spot and their final 1-2 finish together. Busch was eliminated in the Round of 16 at Bristol and finished the season 11th in points.

==== 23XI Racing ====
===== 2022: Last full-time season =====
On August 27, 2021, it was announced that Busch would drive the No. 45 Toyota Camry for 23XI Racing in 2022. He kicked off the season with a 19th-place finish in the Daytona 500. After promising top-five results at Phoenix and Atlanta, Busch faced a series of setbacks, including poor finishes at COTA, Richmond, Bristol Dirt, Dover, and Darlington. However, he bounced back with a victory at Kansas.

====== Accident at Pocono ======

At the Pocono race, Busch was not cleared medically after a qualifying crash and missed the last five races of the regular season. Ty Gibbs substituted for him during recovery from concussion symptoms. On August 25, 2022, Busch withdrew his playoff waiver request, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2012. On October 16, 2022, he announced he would step away from full-time racing in 2023, with the option for part-time participation. However, on August 26, 2023, Busch confirmed his retirement from full-time NASCAR Cup Series competition.

=== NHRA ===
Busch began training in January 2011 under veteran NHRA Pro Stock driver Allen Johnson and earned his NHRA Pro Stock competition license. He made his drag racing debut on March 10, 2011, at the 42nd annual Tire Kingdom Gatornationals in Gainesville. Busch qualified for the Pro Stock field on March 12 and competed in his first Elimination-round on March 13, 2011, where he narrowly lost to Erica Enders by 0.004 seconds. He became only the fourth driver to transition from NASCAR to NHRA, joining Tony Stewart, Richard Petty, and John Andretti.

=== Open-wheel racing ===
In 2003, during CART&#x27;s pre-season test at Sebring International Raceway, Busch tested a Champ Car for three-time CART champion Bobby Rahal. At the time, Busch&#x27;s manufacturer in Winston Cup, Ford, was CART&#x27;s exclusive engine supplier. The test was more for fun than evaluation. Busch drove a car originally fielded for Michel Jourdain Jr. (who later competed in NASCAR) and enjoyed the experience, though he was several seconds off the pace set by Oriol Servià.

In 2013, it was announced that Busch would test an IndyCar for Andretti Autosport, the team owned by 1991 CART champion Michael Andretti, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Andretti&#x27;s team, the defending champions, used Chevrolet engines, the same as Busch’s Furniture Row Racing team in the Sprint Cup Series. Busch did not comment on whether he was preparing to race in the Indianapolis 500.

However, in January 2014, he expressed a strong interest in competing in the iconic race. On March 4, 2014, it was announced that Kurt Busch would attempt to qualify for the 2014 Indianapolis 500, driving a fifth car for Andretti Autosport. He also planned to race in both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day, performing the rare feat of double duty. Busch started 12th in the Indy 500. After a cautious start, he became more competitive as the race progressed and finished sixth, earning praise from fellow NASCAR drivers. However, his attempt to complete the full 1,100 miles across both races ended 191 miles short when his engine blew on lap 273 at Charlotte.

=== Other racing ===
On October 21, 2014, Busch announced that he would compete in the 2014 Race of Champions for Team USA, alongside IndyCar&#x27;s Ryan Hunter-Reay. He also participated in the 2017 Race of Champions, joining his brother Kyle Busch for Team USA NASCAR. In the Nations&#x27; Cup final, they were defeated by Team Germany&#x27;s Sebastian Vettel.

On 14 January 2025, Busch announced he had been medically cleared to return to racing and would compete in the 2025 Race of Champions, his first race since his 2022 concussion.

==Personal life==
Busch was born to Thomas and Gaye Busch in Las Vegas, Nevada. After graduating from Durango High School, he enrolled at the University of Arizona with the intention of earning a degree in Pharmacy.

Busch got engaged to Eva Bryan at the 2005 Hungarian Grand Prix and married her on July 27, 2006. They separated in June 2011. In October 2014, he met Ashley Van Metre and they got engaged on August 26, 2015, marrying on January 7, 2017. They appeared on CMT&#x27;s &quot;Racing Wives&quot; in 2019. Ashley filed for divorce on May 17, 2022.

Busch is an avid baseball fan with the goal of visiting every ballpark nationwide. Having grown up with parents from Chicago, his favorite teams are the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago Bears. He is also a fan of the Vegas Golden Knights.

Before the 2006 season, Busch underwent cosmetic surgery to have his ears pinned back closer to his head.

===Legal issues===
In November 2005, Busch was cited for reckless driving after being pulled over near Phoenix Raceway on suspicion of DUI. He was sentenced to 50 hours of community service, which he was required to complete within a year. In November 2006, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio named Busch an honorary deputy.

In August 14, 2024, Busch was arrested in Iredell County, North Carolina, on charges of driving while intoxicated, speeding, and reckless driving. In November 1, 2024, he pleaded guilty to driving while impaired. As part of a plea agreement, the reckless driving and speeding charges were dropped. Busch received a 60-day jail sentence, which was suspended for 12 months, and 12 months of unsupervised probation. He was also ordered to complete 24 hours of community service, pay a community service fee, and surrender his driver&#x27;s license.

<text>The Berlin U-Bahn (; short for , &quot;underground railway&quot;) is a rapid transit system in Berlin, the capital and largest city of Germany, and a major part of the city&#x27;s public transport system. Together with the S-Bahn, a network of suburban train lines, and a tram network that operates mostly in the eastern parts of the city, it serves as the main means of transport in the capital.

Opened in 1902, the serves 175 stations spread across nine lines, with a total track length of , about 80% of which is underground. Trains run every two to five minutes during peak hours, every five minutes for the rest of the day and every ten minutes in the evening. Over the course of a year, U-Bahn trains travel , and carry over 400 million passengers. In 2017, 553.1 million passengers rode the U-Bahn. The entire system is maintained and operated by the , commonly known as the BVG.

Designed to alleviate traffic flowing into and out of central Berlin, the U-Bahn was rapidly expanded until the city was divided into East and West Berlin at the end of World War II. Although the system remained open to residents of both sides at first, the construction of the Berlin Wall and the subsequent restrictions imposed by East Germany limited travel across the border. The East Berlin U-Bahn lines from West Berlin were severed, except for two West Berlin lines that ran through East Berlin (U6 and U8). These were allowed to pass through East Berlin without stopping at any of the stations, which were closed. Friedrichstraße was the exception because it was used as a transfer point between U6 and the West Berlin S-Bahn system, and a border crossing into East Berlin. The system was reopened completely following the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification.

The Berlin U-Bahn is the most extensive underground network in Germany.
In 2006, travel on the Berlin U-Bahn was equivalent to 122.2 million km (76 million mi) of car journeys.

== History ==

The Berlin U-Bahn was built in three major phases:
# Up to 1913: the construction of the (&quot;small profile&quot;) network in Berlin, Charlottenburg, Schöneberg, and Wilmersdorf;
# Up to 1930: the introduction of the (&quot;large profile&quot;) network that established the first north–south lines;
# From 1953 on: further development after World War II.

In a bid to secure its own improvement, Schöneberg also wanted a connection to Berlin. The elevated railway company did not believe such a line would be profitable, so the city built the first locally financed underground in Germany (intentionally using standard of Berlin U-Bahn rolling stock). It was opened on 1 December 1910. Just a few months earlier, work began on a fourth line to link Wilmersdorf in the southwest to the growing Berlin U-Bahn.


The early network ran mostly east to west, connecting the richer areas in and around Berlin, as these routes had been deemed the most profitable. In order to open up the network to more of the workers of Berlin, the city wanted north–south lines to be established. In 1920, the surrounding areas were annexed to form &quot;Groß-Berlin&quot; (&quot;Greater Berlin Act&quot;), removing the need for many negotiations, and giving the city much greater bargaining power over the private &quot;&quot; (&quot;elevated railway company&quot;). The city also mandated that new lines would use wider carriages—running on the same, standard-gauge track—to provide greater passenger capacity; these became known as the &quot;Großprofil&quot; (&quot;large profile&quot;) network.
Construction of the &quot;&quot; (&quot;North-South railway&quot;) connecting Wedding in the north to Tempelhof and Neukölln in the south had started in December 1912, but halted for the First World War. Work resumed in 1919, although the money shortage caused by hyperinflation slowed progress considerably. On 30 January 1923, the first section opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (Naturkundemuseum), with a continuation to Seestraße following two months later. Desperately underfunded, the new line had to use trains from the old &quot;Kleinprofil&quot; network; the carriages exits had to be widened to fill the gap to the platforms with wooden boards that passengers jokingly referred to as &quot;Blumenbretter&quot; (&quot;boards for flower pots&quot;). The line branched at Belle-Alliance-Straße, now (Mehringdamm); the continuation south to Tempelhof opened on 22 December 1929, the branch to Grenzallee on 21 December 1930.

In 1912, plans were approved for AEG to build its own north–south underground line, named the after its termini, Gesundbrunnen and Neukölln, via Alexanderplatz. Financial difficulties stopped the construction in 1919; the liquidation of AEG-Schnellbahn-AG, and Berlin&#x27;s commitment to the Nord-Süd-Bahn, prevented any further development until 1926. The first section opened on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstraße and Schönleinstraße, with the intermediate Hermannplatz becoming the first station at which passengers could transfer between two different &quot;Großprofil&quot; lines. The completed route was opened on 18 April 1930. Before control of the U-Bahn network was handed over completely to the BVG in 1929, the Hochbahngesellschaft started construction on a final line that, in contrast to its previous lines, was built as part of the &quot;Großprofil&quot; network. The major development was stopped in 1930.

The seizure of power by the National Socialists brought many changes that affected Germany, including the U-Bahn. Most notably, the new national flag was hung in every station, and two of the stations were renamed. Extensive plans—mostly the work of architect Albert Speer—were drawn up that included the construction of a circular line crossing the established U-Bahn lines, and new lines or extensions to many outlying districts. Despite such grand plans, no U-Bahn development occurred. In the Nazi period the only addition to Berlin&#x27;s underground railways was North–South Tunnel of S-Bahn, opened 1936–1939.

During the Second World War, U-Bahn travel soared as car use fell, and many of the underground stations were used as air-raid shelters; however, Allied bombs damaged or destroyed large parts of the U-Bahn system. Although the damage was usually repaired fairly quickly, the reconstructions became more difficult as the war went on. Eventually, on 25 April 1945, the whole system ground to a halt when the power station supplying the network failed. Upon unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany following the Battle for Berlin there were 437 damaged points and 496 damaged vehicles.

The war had damaged or destroyed much of the network; however, of track and 93 stations were in use by the end of 1945, and the reconstruction was completed in 1950. Nevertheless, the consequent division of Berlin into East and West sectors brought further changes to the U-Bahn. Although the network spanned all sectors, and residents had freedom of movement, West Berliners increasingly avoided the Soviet sector and, from 1953, loudspeakers on the trains gave warnings when approaching the border, where passage of East Germans into the Western sectors also became subject to restrictions imposed by their government. There was a general strike on 17 June 1953 which closed the sections of the Berlin U-Bahn that traveled through East Berlin. Just after the strike, on the following day, train service on the line A was resumed and the service C was resumed to provide connections to Nordbahnhof and Friedrichstraße.

Between 1953 and 1955, the 200-Kilometre-Plan was drawn up, detailing the future development of the U-Bahn, which would grow to . Extending the C line to run from Tegel to Alt-Mariendorf was considered the highest priority: the northern extension to Tegel was opened on 31 May 1958. In order to circumvent East Berlin, and provide rapid-transport connections to the densely populated areas in Steglitz, Wedding, and Reinickendorf, a third north–south line was needed. The first section of line G was built between Leopoldplatz and Spichernstraße, with the intention of extending it at both ends. It had been planned to open the G line on 2 September 1961, but an earlier opening on 28 August was forced by the announcement of the construction of the Berlin Wall.

The next crisis was followed by the Berlin Wall construction on 13 August 1961, which had split the city between east and west. The U2 was split into two sections, and for the north–south lines, trains were not allowed to stop for passengers and become &quot;Geisterbahnhöfe&quot; (&quot;ghost stations&quot;), patrolled by armed East-German border guards. Only at Friedrichstraße, a designated border crossing point, were passengers allowed to disembark. A further consequence over the years is that most of the Berlin S-Bahn passengers boycotted the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and transferred to the U-Bahn with numerous expansion.

From 9 November 1989, following months of unrest, the travel restrictions placed upon East Germans were lifted. Tens of thousands of East Berliners heard the statement live on television and flooded the border checkpoints, demanding entry into West Berlin. Jannowitzbrücke, a former ghost station, was reopened two days later as an additional crossing point. It was the first station to be reopened after the opening of the Berlin Wall. Other stations, Rosenthaler Platz and Bernauer Straße on the U8 soon followed suit; and by 1 July 1990, all border controls were removed. In the decade following reunification, only three short extensions were made to U-Bahn lines.

In the 1990s some stations in the eastern portion of the city still sported bullet-riddled tiles at their entrances, a result of World War II battle damage during the Battle of Berlin. These were removed by 21 December 2004.

== U-Bahn network ==
=== Routes ===

The U-Bahn has nine lines:

=== Stations ===
Among Berlin&#x27;s 170 U-Bahn stations there are many with especially striking architecture or unusual design characteristics:


Hermannplatz station resembles something of a U-Bahn cathedral. The platform area is high, long and wide. It was built in connection with the construction of the first North-South Line (&quot;Nord-Süd-Bahn&quot;), now the U8. The architecturally important department store Karstadt adjacent to the station, was being constructed at the same time. Karstadt contributed a large sum of money towards the decoration of the station and was in return rewarded with direct access from the station to the store. Hermannplatz was also the first U-Bahn station in Berlin to be equipped with escalators. Today, Hermannplatz is a busy interchange between the U7 and U8.


Alexanderplatz station is another of the more notable U-Bahn stations in Berlin, and is an important interchange between three lines (U2, U5 and U8). The first part of the station was opened in 1913 along with an extension of today&#x27;s U2 line. In the 1920s Alexanderplatz was completely redesigned, both above and below ground. The U-Bahn station was expanded to provide access to the new D (today&#x27;s U8) and E (today&#x27;s U5) lines, then under construction. The result was a station with a restrained blue-grey tiled colour-scheme and Berlin&#x27;s first underground shopping facilities, designed by Alfred Grenander. Over the last few years Alexanderplatz station has, in stages, been restored; the work was due to be finished in 2007.
Wittenbergplatz station is also unusually designed. It opened in 1902 as a simple station with two side platforms, designed to plans created by Paul Wittig. The station was completely redesigned by Alfred Grenander in 1912, with five platform faces, accommodating two new lines, one to Dahlem on today&#x27;s (U3), and the other to Kurfürstendamm, today&#x27;s Uhlandstraße (Berlin U-Bahn) on the (U1). A provision for a sixth platform was included but has never been completed. The redesign also featured a new entrance building, which blended into the grand architectural styles of Wittenbergplatz and the nearby KaDeWe department store. The interior of the entrance building was again rebuilt after considerable war damage during World War II, this time in a contemporary 1950s style. This lasted until the early 1980s when the interior was retro-renovated back into its original style. Wittenbergplatz station was presented with a London style &quot;Roundel type&quot; station sign in 1952, the 50th Anniversary of the Berlin U-Bahn. Today&#x27;s station is an interchange station between the U1, U2 and U3 lines.

The name of the Gleisdreieck (rail triangle) station is reminiscent of a construction which can only be imagined today. The wye was built in the opening year 1902. Plans for a redesign were made soon after, because the wye was already obsolete. An accident on 26 September 1908, which claimed 18 to 21 lives, was the final straw. The redesign and expansion of the transfer station, during which the station was still used, took until 1912. After World War II the station was put back into service on 21 October 1945 (lower platform) and 18 November 1945 (upper platform). However, service was interrupted again by the construction of the Berlin Wall. From 1972 onwards no trains ran on the lower platform, because servicing the U2 was no longer profitable due to the parallel traffic on the U1. The lower platform was reactivated in 1983, when the test line of the M-Bahn was built from the Gleisdreieck to the Kemperplatz station. It was broken down again after the fall of the Berlin Wall, since it obstructed parts of the reopened U2. Since 1993 the U1 and U2 trains both service the station again.

=== Tickets ===
Berlin public transit passes are available from many places, automated and non-automated, from BVG, Bahn, and authorized third-parties. The Ring-Bahn Line and the other S-Bahn lines are included, as are all U-Bahn lines, buses, trams, ferries, and most trains within the city limits: tickets are valid for all transportation considered part of the Berlin-Regional public transit system.

The Berlin U-Bahn mostly runs on an honor system and has been noted for its relative lack of turnstiles in its stations; instead transportation agents will inspect tickets and fine fare evaders.

Ride-passes (tickets) are available in fare classes: Adult and Reduced. Children between the ages of six and 14 and large dogs qualify for the reduced fare. Children below the age of six and small dogs travel free. There are senior discounts in the form of an annual ticket. Residents who have applied for and received a German Disability Identification card confirming 80% or more disability (ID&#x27;s available from the Versorgungsamt, German Disability Office), can ride without a pass, including an additional person (as a helper). The disability identification card must be in the owner&#x27;s possession when traveling.

With unemployment in the east averaging 15%, another common fare class in Berlin is the S(ocial)-Class. These identification cards are cleared through the normal government offices, then fulfilled at a BVG ride-pass non-automated location. Provided either by the Job Center (Arbeitsamt) for out-of-work residents or by the Sozialamt for people who cannot work or are disabled, the S-Class ride-passes normally restrict travel to the AB zones and must be renewed (a new pass purchased at a non-automated location) on the 1st of each month.

Additional passes are available for those which want to bring a bicycle on the public transit system. A bicycle-pass is included in the Student-class ride-pass, which is provided through the universities.

For small dogs which can be carried there is no additional fare requirement. For each &quot;large dog&quot;, a reduced fare ride-pass must be purchased. Tourist ride-passes, all-day, group passes, and season passes include a dog fare.

BVG ride-passes are issued for specific periods of time, and most require validation with a stamping machine before they are first used. The validation shows the date and time of the first use, and where the ticket was validated (in code), and therefore when the ticket expires. For example, once validated, an all-day pass allows unlimited use from the time of purchase to 3:00 am the following day. Unlike most other metro systems, tickets in Berlin are not checked before entering tram, U-Bahn or S-Bahn stations. They are however checked by the bus drivers upon entering. On the tram, S-Bahn and U-Bahn, a proof-of-payment system is used: there are random spot checks inside by plain-clothed fare inspectors who have the right to demand to see each passenger&#x27;s ticket. Passengers found without a ticket or an expired/invalid ticket are fined €60 per incident. The passenger may be required to pay on the spot, and is required on the spot to give a valid address to which the relevant fine notice can be mailed (it does not have to be in Germany). On the third incident, the BVG calls the offender to court, as there is now a history of &#x27;riding without paying&#x27;.

; Fare zones

: Berlin is a part of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (Berlin-Brandenburg Transit Authority, VBB), which means ticketing and fare systems are unified with that of the surrounding state of Brandenburg. Berlin is divided into three fare zones, known as A, B, and C. Zone A is the area in the centre of Berlin and is demarcated by the S-Bahn urban rail ring line. Zone B covers the rest of the area within the city borders, and Zone C includes the immediate surroundings of Berlin. Zone C is divided into eight parts, each belonging to an administrative district. The Potsdam-Mittelmark area is included in the city district of Potsdam.

: Tickets can be bought for specific fare zones, or multiple zones. Most passengers who live in Berlin buy AB fare zone tickets, while commuters coming in from the suburbs need ABC fare zone tickets. If a ticket not valid for travel in a tariff zone is checked by a ticket inspector, the passenger is subject to a fine.

; Short-term tickets
: Single-journey tickets (&quot;Einzeltickets&quot;) are issued for use within specific fare zones, namely AB, BC, and ABC. They are only valid for two hours after validation, and cannot be extended. The BVG also offers single-day tickets (&quot;Tageskarte&quot;), which are valid for the entire day when first validated until 3 a.m. the next morning.

; Long-term tickets
: Long-term paper tickets are issued with validity periods of seven days (&quot;7-Tage-Karte&quot;), one month (&quot;Monatskarten&quot;), or one year (&quot;Jahreskarte&quot;). The BVG is in the process of introducing the plastic MetroCard as a yearly ticket that also has additional features. The Metrocard also permits passengers to make reservations for hire cars at specific times, for example on weekends. It is expected that plastic Metrocards without such features will also be made available as they are more durable and ecofriendly than the paper tickets.

; Tourist passes
: The BVG offers tickets directed specifically for non-resident tourists of Berlin called the WelcomeCard and CityTourCard . WelcomeCards are valid for either 48 or 72 hours, and can be used by one adult and up to three children between the ages of six and 14. WelcomeCards are valid in fare zones ABC, and have the additional benefit of a reduction on entry fees to many museums and tourist attractions. See the Current Prices and Descriptions link for more information.

=== Underground facilities ===
Mobile phone network in 3G, 4G and 5G is in place throughout the entire U-Bahn networks. This system was in place by 1995 for the E-Plus network, and was one of the first metro systems in the world to allow mobile telephone use; by the late-1990s the other networks could be used in some portions as well. Since 2015, UMTS and LTE is also available for E-Plus and O2 (LTE since 2016) customers, and since 2020 mobile reception in some underground sections has also been extended to Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone Germany customers, with complete reception for the latter two telcos expected to be realised by mid-2021.

Many of the carriages on the U-Bahn feature small flat screen displays that feature news headlines from BZ, weekly weather forecasts, and ads for local businesses.

Most major interchange stations have large shopping concourses with banks, supermarkets, and fast food outlets.

=== Unused stations and tunnels ===
There are several stations, platforms and tunnels that were built in preparation for future U-Bahn extensions, and others that have been abandoned following planning changes. For example, platforms have already been provided for the planned &quot;U3&quot; at Potsdamer Platz on the planned line to Weißensee. It is unlikely that this line, which had the working title &quot;U3&quot; will ever be built, so the platforms have been partially converted into a location for events and exhibitions. The line number &quot;U3&quot; has been used to re-number the branch to Krumme Lanke, which had been part of &quot;U1&quot;.

Line D, today&#x27;s U8, was intended to run directly under Dresdner Straße via Oranienplatz to Kottbusser Tor. This segment of tunnel was abandoned in favour of a slightly less direct route in order to provide the former Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz with a direct connection. This involved the construction of a 90-degree curve of the line between Moritzplatz and Kottbusser Tor stations. The construction of the tunnel under Dresdner Straße had only been partially completed before abandonment, leaving it with only one track. This tunnel is separated into three parts, as it was blocked by a concrete wall where it crossed the border between East and West Berlin. Another concrete wall separates this tunnel, which now houses a transformer for an electricity supplier, from the never-completed Oranienplatz Station which is located partially under the square of the same name.

Stralauer Tor was a station on the eastern bank of the Spree between Warschauer Straße and Schlesisches Tor stations. It was completely destroyed in World War II. It had been opened in 1902 and was renamed &quot;Osthafen&quot; in 1924. Today, only struts on the viaduct remain to indicate its location. In the post-Second World War period it was not thought necessary to rebuild the station, due its close proximity to the Warschauer Straße station. Also its location was directly on the border between the Soviet and American sectors. Although a Berlin map dated 1946 shows the station renamed as Bersarinstraße after the Soviet General responsible for restoring civil administration of the city, this name was used later at another location.

Nürnberger Platz station was closed on 1 July 1959. It was replaced by two new stations on either side, Augsburger Straße and an interchange station to the U9 at Spichernstraße. Today, nothing remains of the station as a third track siding was constructed in its place.

Another tunnel, which once connected the U4 to its original depot and workshop at Otzenstraße (Schöneberg), is still in existence. The connection from Innsbrucker Platz station to the depot was severed when a deep level motorway underpass was constructed in the early 1970s; however, the continuation of the tunnel at Eisackstraße is still in existence for a distance of 270 metres and now ends at the former junction to the workshop of the Schöneberg line.

Platforms at five stations, Rathaus Steglitz, Schloßstraße, Walther-Schreiber-Platz, Innsbrucker Platz, and Kleistpark, were provided for the planned but never constructed U10. The U10 platform at Kleistpark has been converted into office space for the BVG. At Schloßstraße, U9 and U10 were planned to share two directional platforms at different levels; the would-be U10 tracks have been abandoned, leaving both platforms used by U9 trains only. The other U10 platforms remain unused and are not generally open to the public.

During the construction of Adenauerplatz (U7) station, which was built in conjunction with an underpass, platforms were also provided for a planned U1 extension from Uhlandstraße to Theodor-Heuss-Platz. A short tunnel section was also constructed in front of the Internationales Congress Centrum (ICC), beneath the Messedamm/Neue Kantstraße junction. This tunnel was built concurrently with a pedestrian subway and was also intended for the planned extension of the U1. The tunnel section, approximately long, ends at the location of the planned &quot;Messe&quot; station adjacent to Berlins central bus station (ZOB). The tunnel is used as a storage area for theater props.

At Jungfernheide station, double U-Bahn platforms similar to those at Schloßstraße were built for the planned extension of the U5. The unused platform sides are fenced off. The finished (U7) tunnel section which leads off towards Tegel airport is now used for firefighting exercises.

On 4 December 2020, the U5 extension between Alexanderplatz and Brandenburger Tor was opened. This included the new Unter den Linden station, which acts as a transfer point between the lines U5 and U6. Französische Straße station on the U6 was simultaneously closed due to its short distance to the new station.

=== Future development ===

Berlin&#x27;s chronic financial problems make any expansion not mandated by the &quot;Hauptstadtvertrag&quot;—the document that regulates the necessary changes to the city as the capital of Germany—unlikely. Furthermore, there is still great rivalry for construction money between the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. After the construction boom that followed the reunification of the city, enthusiasm for further growth has cooled off; many people feel that Berlin&#x27;s needs are adequately met by the present U- and S-Bahn. As of 2020, the only proposals receiving serious consideration aim to facilitate travel around the existing system, such as moving Warschauer Straße&#x27;s U-Bahn station closer to its S-Bahn station.
There are several long-term plans for the U-Bahn that have no estimated time of completion, most of which involve closing short gaps between stations, enabling them to connect to other lines. This would depend on demand, and new developments in the vicinity. New construction of U-Bahn lines is frequently the subject of political discussion with the Berlin chapters of the CDU, FDP and AfD who usually advocate in favor of U-Bahn expansion while the SPD, Alliance 90/The Greens and The Left typically advocate for tram construction instead.

After the last extension of U5 opened on 4 December 2020, there are no immediate plans to expand the metro system due to lack of budgetary conditions, although there are several extensions of railway lines that can be discussed over time:

== Rolling stock ==

The Berlin U-Bahn uses 750-volt DC electric trains that run on standard gauge ( ) tracks. The first trains were based on trams; they have a width of , and take their power from an upward facing third rail. To accommodate greater passenger numbers without lengthening the trains—which would require costly extended platforms—trains that ran on lines built after World War I were required to be wider. The original trains and lines, which continued to operate, were designated &quot;Kleinprofil&quot; (&quot;small profile&quot;), and the newer, wider trains and lines were designated &quot;Großprofil&quot; (&quot;large profile&quot;). Großprofil trains are wide, and take their power from a downward facing third rail. This is similar to New York City&#x27;s A Division and B Division systems, where the B Division trains are wider than A Division trains (though B Division trains are also longer, while Großprofil trains are generally about the same length as Kleinprofil ones).

Although the two profiles are generally incompatible, Kleinprofil trains have been modified to run on Großprofil lines during three periods of economic difficulty. Between 1923 and 1927 on the Nord-Süd-Bahn, and between 1961 and 1978 on the E line, adapted Kleinprofil trains were used to compensate for the lack of new Großprofil trains: they were widened with wooden boards to reach the platforms; and had their power pickups adapted to accept power from the negatively charged downward-facing third rail, instead of positively charged upward-facing third rail. As of 2017, Class IK Kleinprofil trains are in operation on the Großprofil line U5, after refurbishing the existing F79 rolling stock was deemed unfeasible. They were widened with metal boards by on each side and elevated by to close the gap to the platforms; their power pickups were designed reversible to work on both profiles. As of October 2019, IK rolling stock is still used on the U5; it is intended to move the trains to Kleinprofil lines once new Großprofil rolling stock has been delivered.

As of 2007, Kleinprofil trains run on the U1, U2, U3, U4 and U5 lines; and Großprofil trains operate on the U5, U55, U6, U7, U8, and U9 routes.

=== Kleinprofil (&quot;small profile&quot;) ===

Kleinprofil trains are wide, and high. When the U-Bahn opened in 1902, forty-two power cars, and twenty-one unpowered railroad cars, with a top speed of , had been built at the Warschauer Brücke workshop. In contrast to the earlier test vehicles, seating was placed along the walls, facing inward, which was considered more comfortable. Until 1927, U-Bahn trains had smoking compartments and third-class carriages. The trains were first updated in 1928; A-II carriages were distinguished by only having three windows, and two sliding doors.

After the division of the city, West Berlin upgraded its U-Bahn trains more rapidly than did East Berlin. The A3 type, introduced in 1960, was modelled on the Großprofil D type, and received regular modifications every few years. Meanwhile, A-I and A-II trains operated exclusively in East Berlin until 1975, when G-I trains, which had a top speed of , started to travel the Thälmannplatz–Pankow route. These were superseded in 1988 by the G-I/1 type, which used couplings that were incompatible with the older G-I carriages.

Following reunification, the A3L type was again upgraded as the A3L92. In 2000, prototypes for a Kleinprofil variant of the H series were built; the HK, the first Kleinprofil type to use AC induction motors like their large counterparts, differs from its Großprofil counterpart by not being fully interconnected—carriages are only interconnected within each of the two half-trains.

As of 2005, only trains of the HK, G-I/1 and A3(U/L) types are in active service.

From 2017, new IK-type trains will enter service to replace the remaining examples of type A3L71. Like HK-type trains they will be interconnected and as a result of their regenerative braking will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require.

=== Großprofil (&quot;large profile&quot;) ===
Großprofil trains are wide, and high. The first sixteen power cars and eight unpowered cars entered active service on the Nord-Süd-Bahn in 1924, after a year of using modified Kleinprofil trains. Designated B-I, the cars were long and each had three sliding doors; the large elliptical windows at the front of the train earned them the nickname, &quot;Tunneleulen&quot; (&quot;tunnel owls&quot;). Upgraded B-II trains were introduced in 1927, and continued to be used until 1969. The first C-I trains were trialled in 1926, and two upgrades were produced before the end of the decade. The first U-Bahn trains to use aluminium in their construction, the C-IV types, were introduced in 1930. Many C-type trains were seized by Soviet forces in 1945, to be used in the Moscow Metro.

The first D-type trains, manufactured in 1957, were built from steel, making them very heavy and less efficient; however, the DL type that followed from 1965 used metals that were less dense, allowing a 26% reduction in weight. In East Berlin, D-type trains bought from the BVG were designated D-I. Difficulties there in trying to develop an E series of trains led, in 1962, to the conversion of S-Bahn type 168 trains for use on the E line. These E-III trains were desperately needed at the time to allow modified Kleinprofil trains to return to the increasingly busy A line but, following reunification, high running costs led to their retirement in 1994.

In West Berlin, the successor to the D-type was the F-type, which debuted in 1973. They varied from other models in having seats that were perpendicular to the sides of the train; from 1980, they also became the first U-Bahn trains to use three-phase electricity. In 1995, the original seating arrangement returned as the H series took up service. H-type trains are characterised by the interconnection of carriages throughout the length of the train; and they can only be removed from the tracks at main service depots.

As of 2005, only F, H, and a variation of the IK-type trains are in active service.

=== Depots ===


Depots of the Berlin U-Bahn fall into one of two classes: main workshops (, abbreviated as &quot;Hw&quot;); and service workshops (, abbreviated &quot;Bw&quot;). The main workshops are the only places where trains can be lifted from the tracks; they are used for the full inspections required every few years, and for any major work on trains. The service workshops only handle minor repairs and maintenance, such as replacing windows, or removing graffiti.

As of 2005, the only dedicated Kleinprofil depot is at Grunewald (Hw Gru/Bw Gru), which opened on 21 January 1913. The first Großprofil depot opened at Seestraße (Hw See/Bw See) in 1923, to service the Nord-Süd-Bahn. It has 17 tracks—2 for the main workshop, and 15 for the service workshop—but its inner-city location prevents any further expansion. Due to BVG budget cuts, the Seestraße depot also services Kleinprofil trains. Two further Großprofil service workshops are located at Friedrichsfelde (Bw Fri), and Britz-Süd (Bw Britz).

In the past, there were other workshops. The first opened in 1901 at Warschauer Brücke, and was the construction site for most of the early U-Bahn trains. The division of the U-Bahn network on 13 August 1961 forced its closure, although it was reopened in 1995 as a storage depot. A small depot operated at Krumme Lanke between 22 December 1929 and 1 May 1968; and, while the network was split, East Berlin&#x27;s U-Bahn used the S-Bahn depot at Schöneweide, along with a small service workshop at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz, which was closed following reunification.

== Accidents ==
The Berlin ranks among the safest modes of transport: its history features few accidents.

The most severe accident occurred at the original &quot;(rail triangle)&quot;, where the main and branch lines were connected by switches that allowed the tracks to cross. On 26 September 1908, a train driver missed a stop signal. As a result, two trains collided at the junction, and one fell off the viaduct. The accident killed eighteen people, and severely injured another twenty-one. &#x27;s triangular layout had already been deemed unsuitable for future developments; this incident—and a later, less-serious one—triggered its reconstruction as a multi-level station, starting in 1912.

On 30 June 1965, a train with brake failure stopped on the G line—today&#x27;s U9—between and . Unaware of the faulty train, a mechanic working at the signal tower noticed that the signal for the affected section had been set to &quot;Stop&quot; for a long time. Thinking it was a fault of his, after several attempts he manually overrode the signal, in defiance of regulations that strictly prohibited such actions. The following train, which had been waiting at , then left the station on the same track. With emergency brakes unable to prevent the accident, the two trains collided. One passenger was killed in the crash, and 97 were injured. The mechanic was fined 600,000 DM.

Fires can be particularly dangerous and damaging within an underground system. In October 1972, two trains and a length of tunnel were completely destroyed when the trains caught fire; the reconstructed tunnel is clearly distinguishable from the old one. Another train burned out in the connecting tunnel between Klosterstraße and Alexanderplatz in 1987. On 8 July 2000, the last car of a GI/I train suffered a short circuit, burning out at the rear of the Deutsche Oper station. The single exit of the station was unreachable, forcing the passengers to run through the tunnel to reach the next emergency exit. The fire also damaged the station, which remained closed until that September. The Portuguese Ambassador, João Diogo Nunes Barata, presented the BVG with (tiled paintings), specially designed for the station, by the artist José de Guimarães. Installation of Portugal&#x27;s gift to the city was completed on 30 October 2002.

As a consequence of the Deutsche Oper incident, BVG decided to post an employee at every station with only one exit until a second exit could be built. Over the following few years, many of those stations—including Britz-Süd, Schillingstraße, Viktoria-Luise-Platz, Uhlandstraße, and Theodor-Heuss-Platz—were retrofitted with additional exits. By June 2008, the only remaining stations with no second exit, Konstanzer Straße and Rudow, had been fitted with second exits. Despite these changes, several passenger organisations—such as Pro Bahn, and IGEB—demand that stations with exits in the middle of the platform also be fitted with additional emergency exits. Many stations are built this way; meeting those demands would place a heavy financial burden on both the BVG and the city.

The U6 saw a particularly costly, though casualty-free, incident on 25 March 2003. Scheduled repair work on the line limited the normal service to between Alt-Mariendorf and Kurt-Schumacher-Platz; one train then shuttled back and forth between Kurt-Schumacher-Platz and Holzhauser Straße, sharing a platform at Kurt-Schumacher-Platz with the normal-service trains departing for their return journey to Alt-Mariendorf. Needing to pass several stop signals on the shuttle service, the driver had been given special instructions how to proceed. Unfortunately, he ignored the signal at the entry to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz, and ploughed into the side of a train heading back to Alt-Mariendorf. The impact wrecked both trains, and caused considerable damage to the tracks. Normal service did not resume for two days, and the removal of the two wrecked trains—which, surprisingly, could still roll along the tracks—also took nearly 48 hours.

== Films, music and merchandising ==
The Berlin U-Bahn has appeared in numerous films and music videos. Offering access to stations, tunnels, and trains, the BVG cooperates with film-makers, although a permit is required.

Whether set in Berlin or elsewhere, the U-Bahn has had at least a minor role in a large number of movies and television programmes, including &quot;Emil and the Detectives&quot; (2001), &quot;Otto – Der Film&quot; (1985), &quot;&quot; (1987) featuring Ingolf Lück, &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; (1998), and several &quot;Tatort&quot; episodes. The previously unused Reichstag station was used to shoot scenes of the movies &quot;Resident Evil&quot; and &quot;Equilibrium&quot;. The U-Bahn station Messe was used as coverage in the films &quot;Hanna&quot; and &quot;The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2&quot;.

&quot;Möbius 17&quot;, by Frank Esher Lämmer and Jo Preussler from Berlin, tells the story of an U-Bahn train that, caught in a Möbius strip, travels through alternate universes after a new line is built.

Alexanderplatz station plays an essential role in &quot;Berlin Alexanderplatz&quot;—a film of thirteen hour-long chapters and one epilogue—produced in 1980 by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, based on the book by Döblin. The film&#x27;s scenes feature a recreation of the station as it was in 1928—rather darker and dirtier than in the 21st century. In the surrealistic two-hour epilogue, Fassbinder transforms parts of the station into a slaughterhouse where people are killed and dissected.

Since 2001, the Berlin U-Bahn has hosted the annual short-film festival &quot;Going Underground&quot;. Short films (up to 90 seconds long) are shown on the monitors found in many of the U-Bahn trains. Passengers on board vote for the festival winner.

Sandy Mölling, former singer of the pop band No Angels, shot the video for her single &quot;Unnatural Blonde&quot; in the U-Bahn station Deutsche Oper. Kate Ryan, Overground, Böhse Onkelz, Xavier Naidoo, Die Fantastischen Vier, and the DJ duo Blank &amp; Jones have all used the U-Bahn and its stations for their videos as well.

&quot;Linie 1&quot;, a musical performed by Berlin&#x27;s Grips-Theater, is set completely in stations and trains of the Berlin U-Bahn; a movie version has also been produced.

In 2002, the BVG cooperated with design students in a project to create underwear with an U-Bahn theme, which, in English, they named &quot;Underwear&quot;. They used the names of real stations that, in the context of underwear, appeared to be mild sexual double entendres: men&#x27;s underpants bore labels with &quot;Rohrdamm&quot; (pipe dam), &quot;Onkel Toms Hütte&quot; (Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin), and &quot;Krumme Lanke&quot; (crooked lake); the women&#x27;s had &quot;Gleisdreieck&quot; (triangle track), and &quot;Jungfernheide&quot; (virgin heath). After the first series sold out quickly, several others were commissioned, such as &quot;Nothammer&quot; (emergency hammer), and &quot;Pendelverkehr&quot; (shuttle service; though &quot;Verkehr&quot; also means &quot;intercourse&quot; and &quot;Pendel&quot; also means &quot;pendulum&quot;). They were withdrawn from sale in 2004.

<text>Sir William Frederick Lloyd (December 17, 1864 – June 13, 1937) was a newspaper editor and Prime Minister of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1918 to 1919.

Born in Stockport, England, Lloyd emigrated to Newfoundland in 1890 where he taught school before becoming a journalist and becoming editor of &quot;The Telegram&quot;. He was first elected to the Newfoundland House of Assembly in 1904 as a Liberal and became Leader of the opposition in 1916.

Due to a political crisis over conscription the government of Sir Edward Patrick Morris formed a National Government and invited Lloyd to join as Attorney-General. After Morris retired at the end of 1917, the governor asked Lloyd to form a government even though he was from a minority party. Lloyd took over the National Government but in 1919 his minister of finance, Sir Michael Patrick Cashin, who had succeeded Morris as leader of the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party moved a motion of no confidence and defeated the Lloyd government. Cashin became the new prime minister and Lloyd returned to the opposition benches.

Lloyd served again in government, briefly, as minister of justice in 1924.

In the 1919 New Year Honours, he was named Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.

He married Agnes Taylor in 1896; the couple had one son.

William F. Lloyd died in St. John&#x27;s on June 13, 1937.

<text>The Seversky Donets () or Siverskyi Donets (), usually simply called the Donets, is a river on the south of the East European Plain. It originates in the Central Russian Upland, north of Belgorod, flows south-east through Ukraine (Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts) and then again through Russia (Rostov Oblast) to join the river Don, about from the Sea of Azov. The Donets is the fourth-longest river in Ukraine, and the largest in eastern Ukraine, where it is an important source of fresh water. It gives its name to the Donets Basin, known commonly as the Donbas, an important coal-mining and industrial region in Ukraine.

==Etymology==
The names &quot;Don&quot; and its diminutive &quot;Donets&quot; are derived from Iranic, Sarmatian &quot;the river&quot;. Scytho-Sarmatians inhabited the areas to the north of the Black Sea from 1100 BC into the early medieval times.

In the 2nd century CE Ptolemy knew the river Don, into which the Donets flows, as &quot;Tanais&quot;, and Western Europeans recognized that the Don had a significant tributary which they called either the small Tanais or &quot;Donetz&quot;. The Slavic name of &quot;Seversky Donets&quot; derived from the fact that the river originates from the land of Severians. As the Italian-Polish chronicler Alexander Guagnini (1538–1614) wrote: &quot;There is also another, small Tanais, which originates in the Seversky Principality (for this reason it is called Donets Seversky) and flows into the large Tanais above Azov&quot;.

==Geography and hydrology==

The Donets is the largest river in eastern Ukraine and the largest tributary of the Don. Its total length is and the basin area is . Most of the river&#x27;s length stretches across Ukraine. The average annual flow is near the source and at the confluence to the Don.

The Donets originates on the Central Russian Upland, near Podolkhi village, Prokhorovka area, north of Belgorod, at an elevation of above sea level. Its basin contains over 3000 rivers, of which 425 are longer than and 11 are longer than ; 1011 of those rivers directly flow into the Donets. These rivers are mostly fed by melting snow, and thus the water supply is uneven during the year. The spring flood lasts about two months, from February to April – during this period the water level rises by . Excessive flooding is rare due to numerous artificial water reservoirs constructed along the river.
The width of the river mostly ranges between , sometimes reaching and even in the reservoir area. The river bottom is sandy and uneven, with the depth varying between and the average value of . The river freezes from around mid-December until late March and is covered by thick ice. It flows into the Don from the latter&#x27;s mouth, at an elevation of above sea level; thus the fall of the river is with the average gradient of 0.18 m/km.
;Tributaries and reservoirs
* Right bank: Babka, Udy, Mozh, Bereka, Kazennyi Torets, Bakhmutka, Luhan, Luhanchyk, Great Kamianka, Kundryuchya
* Left bank: Nezhegol, Vovcha, Khotimlia, Velykyi Burluk, Hnylytsia, Balakliika, Iziumets, Oskil, Netryus, Zherebets&#x27;, Krasna, Borova, Aidar, Derkul, Glubokaya, Kalitva, Bystraya
* Water reservoirs: Belgorod water reservoir, Pechenizke water reservoir

==Current==

The flow is slow, between at Chuhuiv and near Lysychansk. The river valley is wide: from in the upper part and up to downstream, and is asymmetrical. The right bank is usually high, sometimes with chalk cliffs, and is dissected by gullies. The left bank is more flat, contains numerous swamps, lakes and oxbow lakes, the largest of which is lake Lyman. The river is meandering, especially above the Oskil tributary.

Upstream, above Belgorod, the river contains several dams and small reservoirs. Downstream, below the confluence with the Wolf River (Volchiya River), there is the Pechenizke Reservoir (volume 86 km3), which supplies water to the city of Kharkiv. Below the Pechenizke Reservoir, the Donets is fed by the Udy and by its largest tributary, the Oskil. There the valley widens and its floodplain creates numerous oxbow lakes. Within Ukraine, the river flows between the Cisdesna plateau and the Donets lowland. In its middle, the river is partly fed by the Dnieper waters, which are brought though the Dnieper–Donbas–Seversky Donets channels which provide water to the coal industry of the Donets Basin (usually called the Donbas). Near the Russian city of Donetsk (Rostov oblast), the river crosses the Donets Ridge and flows in a narrow valley with steep and rocky slopes. In the lower part of the Donets lowland, the flow is interrupted by sluices and is slow. At the delta, it splits into three distributaries.

==Navigation==
At present, the Donets is navigable up to the city of Donetsk (Rostov Oblast), 222 km from the mouth. Navigation on the last section is supported by six dams, built from 1911 to 1914. Each consists of a long concrete dam and a single-chamber sluice, long, wide and deep. At the end of the 19th - beginning of the 20th centuries, a number of attempts were made to revive shipping, in particular, for the sake of the possibility of water transportation of minerals in the Donbass. One of the enthusiasts of the project was D. I. Mendeleev, who wrote about the need to “arrange the Donets […] for our Russian needs […] because the Donets, due to the importance of the interests involved in it, is most necessary”[39]. The developer of the project was the Russian hydraulic engineer Nestor Platonovich Puzyrevsky, known for his contribution to the Volga-Don Canal project. In 1903-1904, he conducted a detailed study of the channel of the Seversky Donets and proposed a project to restore the navigation of the Seversky Donets to the city of Belgorod, which involves the construction of a large number of locks were interrupted by World War I, Russian Civil War and lack of funds. The design of the dams and their old age slowed the navigation of the river, which is currently rather limited.

==History==
===Pre-industrial era===

The river played a crucial role for its ancient settlers as a source of water and food, means of transportation and trade route. The first archaeological evidence of settlers relates to Cheulean and Acheulean periods of Lower Paleolithic through stone tools (axes) found on the river banks near Izium city of Kharkiv Oblast and in Luhansk Oblast. Over the ages, the river banks were populated by tribals of various cultures, including Mousterian, Yamna, Catacomb, Scythian, Alan, Khazar and later Slavic cultures. Many of the related tribals had nomadic lifestyle characteristic of Kipchak people, Golden Horde and later of Cossacks. The river flows through the historic lands of Sloboda Ukraine as well as the lands of Don River Host. The many Cossacks became later assimilated into the strengthening Russian Empire, which had rebuilt and reinforced the fortress of Belgorod and cities of Kyiv, Izium, Luhansk, Chuhuiv and others in order keep defensive lines against the raids of nomads from the south-east. Later, the protective role of the river basin gave way to economic needs. In the 18th–19th centuries, the river was extensively used for watermills, which numbered by hundreds by the end of the 18th century, and the mill dams interrupted navigation on the river.

===Industrial era===

Industrialization in the 20th century shifted interests to mineral exploitation in Donbas, with water-hungry plants concentrated mostly in Kyiv, Luhansk and Donetsk. Already by the 1930s, Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk were lacking water forcing the authorities to gradually create a network of canals and reservoirs. In 1936, the Kochetok Reservoir was created and coupled to the water system of Kharkiv. By the 1950s, this measure proved insufficient, and in the 1960s, Pechenizke Reservoir was constructed in place of the Kochetok Reservoir. It has with the capacity of 400 million m3 and provides about 75% of water consumed by Kharkiv. To supply water to southern Donbas and Donetsk, the 130-km long Donets-Donbas channel was built around 1958 starting near Raigorodok city, and in compensation, the Dnieper-Donbas channel was created to supply water from Dnieper River to the upstream of the Donets via the Bereka River. As a result of the industrial activity, the wild nature of Donets Basin transformed into an industrial settlement. After the breakup of the USSR, most of the basin territory became part of Ukraine.

===Russo-Ukrainian War===

During the War in Donbas, Luhansk Oblast was roughly split along the river between the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic, which controlled most of the portion of the oblast south of the Donets, and the Ukrainian government, which controlled most of the territory north of the Donets.

In May 2022, Russian attempts to cross the Donets above Lysychansk were stopped in the operationally decisive Battle of the Siverskyi Donets.
==Environment==

Being one of the largest rivers in Ukraine, the Donets is very intensively used in farming and industry. Ukraine alone uses more than of river waters per year, half of which is returned as polluted discharges; this consumption effectively reduces river runoff by .

Donets suffered greatly even back in the 18th century, when old oaks were cut down along its banks. The industrial development of the 19th century reduced the groundwater levels of the basin. This resulted in shallowing of the river and slowed navigation. Until the mid-19th century, the river was rich in fish which population rapidly declined since then. The water quality is graded as level IV (polluted) to V (dirty). The main pollutants are fertilizers, petroleum, phenols, zinc, chromium and copper. In Kharkiv Oblast, water is contaminated by industrial and communal wastes of Belgorod, Izium and Shebekino cities, but the water is partially purified through the Pechenizke Reservoir. The density of plants and thus the contamination increase downstream in Donetsk and Luhansk areas, especially around Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk, about 400 km from the mouth. Some tributaries of the Donets, such as Kozenyi Butt, Bakhmut and Lugan are so polluted that consuming fish caught there is dangerous.
The purest segment of Donets is between the source and Belgorod, and between the Pechenizke Reservoir and Chuhuiv. Average water salinity is 650–750 mg/L, and it increases in winter to 1000 mg/L mostly due to industrial wastewater.

==Flora and fauna==

===Fish ===
The Donets hosts 44 species of fish, predominantly small fishes such as European perch, rutilus and common rudd. Medium and large species include bream, perch, catfish and pike and are becoming increasingly rare. Near Pechenizke Reservoir a large hatchery of carp has successfully operated since 1967.

===Amphibians and reptiles===

On the banks of the river, in the floodplain wetlands, there are abundant water frogs, toads (especially green toad), smooth and great crested newts and less common grass snake, dice snake and European pond terrapin.

===Mammals===
Human activities, mainly cultivation of the steppes, resulted in the disappearance of animals formerly common in the basin, such as tarpan, steppe antelope, saiga antelope, marmots and others. Back in the 1960s–1970s, especially near Oskil River, it was not unusual to meet bobak marmot, Eurasian deer, wild boar and Russian desman. Current mammals of the basin include European beaver, Dipodidae, suslik, mice, European otter, European mink, weasel and bats.

===Birds===
The number of bird species of the river basin reduced sharply over the past 100–150 years. The disappeared species include steppe eagle, tirkusha, sociable lapwing, bustard, black and winged lark. Less common are geese, swans, golden eagle, white-tailed eagle, peregrine falcon, honey buzzard and osprey. The reduction is mainly caused by the destruction of forests, especially old groves along the river banks. The creation of artificial forest belts (windbreaks) in the basin in the 1960s brought insectivorous birds new to this area, such as &quot;Streptopelia&quot;, European magpie and shrikes. From the traditional bird types, still common are several species of ducks, crows, Charadriiformes, &quot;Podiceps&quot;, great reed warbler and much less common are herons and storks. Only 12 individuals of demoiselle cranes remain in the area, near Sviatohirsk city. During the migratory season, the region is visited by greylag and black geese.

===Flora===
Banks of the river used to contain groves of trees, which were cut during the 18th–19th centuries. Some of the trees were used for shipbuilding during the Russian-Turkish wars in the time of Peter I. By the 20th century, most meadows along the river banks were converted into farmers&#x27; fields. Only a small part of the old groves remains, mainly in the Kharkiv Oblast. North of Izium, there are still broadleaf forests, and pine forests are found near Chuhuiv. Many species of wild plants survive near floodplain wetlands. These include willow, downy birch, alder and krushinnik. Along the river banks, there are cane, swamp horsetail, carex, kizlyak, swamp sabelnik and other types of grass.

==Tourism==

The Donets is regarded as one of the most scenic rivers of East European Plain and contains many hiking and biking routes along its banks. Canoe rafting is rather popular, especially between Zmiiv and Sviatohirsk. Rafting is of the first (lowest) degree of difficulty. The busiest tourism months are from May to September. The most picturesque part is probably near the town of Izium, which hosts a National Park of Holy Mountains. 
Down to Lysychansk, the water is clean for swimming, and there are many sandy beaches on the shores. Near Pechenizke Reservoir, there are several health resorts.

<text>Kevin Maurice Garnett ( ; born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed &quot;the Big Ticket,&quot; Garnett is considered one of the greatest power forwards of all time, known for his intensity, versatility, and defensive ability. As of 2024, he is one of five NBA players to have won both the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.

In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald&#x27;s All-American at Farragut Career Academy and a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. Garnett made an immediate impact with the Minnesota Timberwolves, leading them to eight consecutive playoff appearances. In 2004, he led the Timberwolves to the Western Conference Finals and won the NBA MVP Award. He was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year with the Boston Celtics during the 2007–08 season, his first with the team.

Garnett was traded to the Celtics in 2007, helping lead them to the 2008 NBA Finals and beat the Los Angeles Lakers, while also finishing in third place for the MVP award. In 2013, Garnett was included in a second headline trade that sent him to the Brooklyn Nets with longtime Celtic Paul Pierce. In 2015, Garnett was traded back to Minnesota. He announced his retirement from professional basketball in September 2016. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

During his NBA career, Garnett was named to 15 All-Star Games, winning the All-Star MVP award in 2003. He was named to the All-NBA Team nine times and the NBA All-Defensive Team 12 times. Garnett also holds several Timberwolves franchise records.

Garnett made his feature film debut, playing a fictionalized version of himself, in the 2019 film &quot;Uncut Gems&quot;.

==Early life==
Garnett was born on May 19, 1976, in Greenville, South Carolina. He is the middle child and has two sisters. Garnett&#x27;s mother, Shirley Garnett, never married his father, O&#x27;Lewis McCullough, with their relationship ending shortly after his birth. Garnett grew up with his mother and stepfather.

Garnett fell in love with the sport of basketball while attending Hillcrest Middle School, although he did not play organized basketball until high school. In his first three years of high school, Garnett attended Mauldin High School in Mauldin, South Carolina, and played on the school&#x27;s basketball team. However, during the summer before his senior year of high school, Garnett was in the general vicinity of a fight between black and white students. Although not directly involved, Garnett was one of three students arrested for second-degree lynching, a charge that was expunged through a pre-trial intervention. Due to the racially charged incident and fearful of being a target, Garnett decided to leave Mauldin High and transferred to Farragut Career Academy in Chicago&#x27;s West Side, for his senior year of high school.

Living with his sister in Chicago, Garnett led Farragut to a 28–2 record and was named National High School Player of the Year by &quot;USA Today&quot;. He was also named Mr. Basketball for the state of Illinois after averaging 25.2 points, 17.9 rebounds, 6.7 assists and 6.5 blocks while shooting 66.8% from the field. In four years of high school, Garnett posted an impressive 2,553 points, 1,809 rebounds and 737 blocked shots. In high school, Garnett played alongside Ronnie Fields, who also became a professional basketball player. Garnett was named the Most Outstanding Player at the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game after registering 18 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 blocked shots, and then declared himself eligible for the 1995 NBA draft. To mark the 35th anniversary of the McDonald&#x27;s All-American High School Boys Basketball Game, Garnett was honored as one of 35 Greatest McDonald&#x27;s All-Americans. Garnett&#x27;s decision not to play college basketball was influenced in part by his failure to score well enough on the ACT to meet NCAA requirements for freshman eligibility. Garnett told &quot;Student Sports Magazine&quot; in 1995 that if he went to college, he would have played college basketball for the University of Maryland, a moderate surprise at the time considering, while Maryland and North Carolina were contenders, the University of Michigan were viewed as front-runners in Garnett&#x27;s recruitment. However, in the years since his recruitment, several figures close to the recruitment, including former Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro, as well as Garnett himself, have stated that he would have likely attended Michigan, influenced by an appreciation of the Fab Five and Chris Webber, in particular.

A Chicago area high school coach referred Garnett to Eric Fleisher, then agent for 18 NBA players and son of first National Basketball Players Association head Larry Fleisher, to discuss the possibility of going to the NBA straight out of high school. Two weeks later at the Lakeshore Athletic Club, Fleisher ran a small tryout where Garnett dominated against older, more experienced competition. Fleisher then set Detroit Pistons assistant John Hammond to run the drills at another workout at the University of Illinois-Chicago to gauge NBA interest. Representatives from the 13 teams with lottery picks, with Kevin McHale, Elgin Baylor, Flip Saunders, and Kevin Loughery among them, were in the workout that was scheduled around the same time as a pre-draft tryout camp. The workout included Garnett touching the box painted on the backboard above the rim multiple times, and McHale giving Garnett tips on shooting jump shots. An hour before going to the 1995 NBA draft in the Toronto SkyDome, his coach at Farragut, William (Wolf) Nelson, gave encouragement and told Garnett that he passed the last SAT test he took with a score of 970.

==Professional career==
===Minnesota Timberwolves (1995–2007)===
====Early years (1995–1997)====
Garnett was drafted with the fifth overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and became the first player to be drafted directly out of high school since 1975. Since joining the NBA for the 1989–90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season. In Garnett&#x27;s rookie season, the Timberwolves were in the midst of a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach and with the urging of Sam Mitchell. In the final 42 games of the year, averaged 14 points, 8.4 rebounds and 2.26 blocks as a starter. In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, but he did have a very respectable rookie year. He was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team on averages of 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per game. Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.

Before the 1996–97 season, the Timberwolves made a draft-day trade for point guard Stephon Marbury of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. During the season, Garnett posted improved averages of 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals. He also had two games where he registered eight blocks. With a 40–42 record, the Timberwolves made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, Garnett and Gugliotta made their first All-Star appearances, and Marbury established himself as a valuable young lead guard. However, the Houston Rockets, led by Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, and Charles Barkley, proved to be too much as the Timberwolves were swept 3–0 in the first round of the 1997 NBA Playoffs.

====Franchise player (1997–2001)====
In August 1997, Garnett and Fleisher turned down the Timberwolves&#x27; offer of a contract worth $102 million over six years. They thought there would be more offered to them on the basis of the signings of $105 million over seven years for Alonzo Mourning of the Miami Heat and $100.8 million over seven years for Juwan Howard with the Washington Bullets. To get out of the spotlight while negotiations were ongoing, Garnett stayed in Fleisher&#x27;s Westchester County home, north of New York City. One hour before the deadline on October 1, 1997, the Timberwolves and Garnett agreed on a six-year contract extension that was worth an unparalleled $126 million. The contract was considered a risky move and many analysts speculated that the deal would make it impossible for the Wolves to sign new players or even keep their own. The enormous size of Garnett&#x27;s contract was considered, by numerous sports writers, a major cause of labor tensions between players and owners that led to a lockout which shortened the 1998–99 NBA season. Despite the furor over his new contract, Garnett continued to improve, averaging 18.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks, and 1.7 steals per game. Again, he was an All-Star, and the Timberwolves finished with their first winning record in franchise history (45–37 for the season). For the second consecutive year, the young Timberwolves bowed out of the playoffs in the first round, this time losing 3–2 to the Seattle SuperSonics and superstar point guard Gary Payton. The two wins against the Sonics marked the Wolves&#x27; first-ever playoff game wins. The off-season started poorly for the Timberwolves though as 20-point per game scorer Tom Gugliotta left for the Phoenix Suns.
In the lockout-shortened season that followed, Garnett broke through as a superstar. Putting up stats of 20.8 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.8 blocks per game, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team. However, midway through the season, Stephon Marbury was traded to the New Jersey Nets. Although the Wolves received two-time All-Star Terrell Brandon in return, they were not able to overcome the discord and limped into the playoffs as the eighth seed with a 25–25 record. The Wolves were defeated in the first round again, this time losing 3–1 to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs who were led by young superstar and eventual NBA Finals MVP Tim Duncan. In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Garnett continued his notable play, averaging 22.9 points, 11.8 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.6 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game. Garnett also made the first of his four All-NBA First Team appearances and came in second place in the MVP voting. Assisted by sharpshooting rookie forward Wally Szczerbiak and steady veteran Terrell Brandon, the Wolves posted a franchise-best 50–32 record, but succumbed in the first round to the Portland Trail Blazers 3–1.

On May 20, 2000, Timberwolves&#x27; guard and Garnett&#x27;s close friend Malik Sealy was killed by a drunk driver shortly after celebrating Garnett&#x27;s 24th birthday. Later that year, the NBA ruled that the free-agent signing of Joe Smith was illegal. The league punished the team for the illegal signing by stripping them of three first-round draft picks, fining Glen Taylor (the owner of the team) $3.5 million, and banning general manager Kevin McHale for one year. In the 2000–01 NBA season, Garnett led the Wolves to a 47–35 record and made the All-NBA Second Team, but again, the Wolves did not survive the first round of the playoffs, losing to the Spurs 3–1.

====MVP and division champions (2001–2004)====
In the 2001–02 season, Garnett posted another notable season, his averages of 21.2 points, 12.1 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game enough for another All-NBA Second Team nomination. However, the Timberwolves bowed out in the first round for the sixth consecutive time, this time getting swept 3–0 by the Dallas Mavericks led by Michael Finley, Steve Nash, and Dirk Nowitzki. Garnett&#x27;s next season was one of the best of his career, his 23.0 ppg / 13.4 rpg / 6.0 apg / 1.6 bpg / 1.4 spg season earning him his second All-NBA First Team nomination and second place in the MVP voting. The Timberwolves posted a good 51–31 record, but for the seventh consecutive time, they did not make it out of the first round, this time losing to the Los Angeles Lakers 4–2.

In the 2003–04 season, things finally seemed to come together for Garnett. In past years, the Wolves had practically been a one-man show, but now, the Timberwolves had made two valuable acquisitions: highly talented but volatile swingman Latrell Sprewell and the seasoned two-time NBA champion Sam Cassell, who supplanted Troy Hudson at point guard. In addition, defensive center Ervin Johnson complemented the inconsistent Michael Olowokandi. Powered by the best supporting cast up to this point in his career, Garnett averaged 24.2 points, 13.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 2.2 blocks and 1.5 steals per game for the season. Having recorded career-highs in points, rebounds, blocks and leading the league rebounds, Garnett was named the league Most Valuable Player for the first time in his career. With a franchise-record 58 wins, the Wolves stormed into the playoffs, and finally conquered their playoff bane by defeating the Denver Nuggets 4–1 in the first round. After disposing of the strong Sacramento Kings 4–3 in the Western Conference semi-finals, Garnett and the Timberwolves met the Lakers in the Western Conference Finals. There, playmaker Cassell went down with a back injury. With reserve point guard Hudson also injured, the Timberwolves alternated between third playmaker Darrick Martin and shooting guard Fred Hoiberg at the &quot;one&quot;, or even running Garnett himself as point forward or a real point guard. The Los Angeles Lakers pulled off a 4–2 victory in the series.

====Frustration (2004–2007)====
On January 4, 2005, Garnett scored a career high 47 points to go along with 17 rebounds in a 115–122 loss to the Phoenix Suns. He was also named to the All-NBA Second Team, but the Timberwolves failed to make the playoffs for the first time in eight years with a record of 44–38. The 2005–06 season brought more frustration for Garnett. Sprewell turned down a three-year, $21 million extension, and the Wolves wary of his injuries and age, traded Cassell for the much less effective Marko Jarić, and the team&#x27;s record for 2005–06 fell to 33–49. Despite Garnett&#x27;s play, the team logged the second-worst record since Garnett joined the franchise. The Timberwolves&#x27; record dropped further in 2006–07, going 32–50 that season. In both of those seasons, Garnett earned All-NBA Third Team honors.

During the 2007 off-season, Glen Taylor admitted that although he planned on retaining Garnett, he finally listened to trade offers. Garnett&#x27;s name was mentioned in various trade rumors involving the Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors, Indiana Pacers, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, and Dallas Mavericks. Garnett later confirmed that his preferred trade destinations were the Lakers, Celtics, and Suns. He had initially contacted Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant about joining the team as the Lakers were his initial top choice but Bryant didn&#x27;t answer or return the calls. Garnett stated, &quot;I&#x27;m just being honest with everybody. I wanted to link with Kobe. Kobe and I had a different connect. When Kobe-Shaq went on their little thing, a lot of people went with Shaq. A lot of people didn&#x27;t even fuck with Kobe. You know, Kobe, whatever. One of the very few to just stay with him. I was a neutral guy, anyway. I show everybody love. I tried to link with him, and I couldn&#x27;t get him on the line.&quot; The Lakers originally had a trade framework in place that involved Lamar Odom and Andrew Bynum.

===Boston Celtics (2007–2013)===

==== NBA championship, DPOY award and injury (2007–2009) ====
On July 31, 2007, in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Gerald Green, Theo Ratliff, cash considerations, Boston&#x27;s 2009 first-round draft pick (top 3 protected), and the 2009 first-round pick which Minnesota traded to Boston in the Ricky Davis–Wally Szczerbiak trade of 2006. The 7-for-1 deal constitutes the largest number of players traded for a single player in league history. At the time of the trade, Garnett had the longest current tenure of any player in the NBA with one team, having played for the Timberwolves for his first 12 seasons (a total of 927 games). Garnett said that he was proud to be a part of the Celtics and hoped to continue its proud tradition and basketball success. On the day the trade was announced, Garnett signed a three-year, $60 million contract extension that would start after his prior deal ran out in 2009. On August 1, the day after signing with the Celtics, Garnett threw the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park prior to a Red Sox–Orioles game.

The trade for Garnett had many experts speculating that the Celtics would have a resurgence during the 2007–08 season. The combination of Paul Pierce, Ray Allen, and Garnett were almost automatically nicknamed &quot;The Big Three&quot; by the media, after the Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish trio. Garnett wore jersey number 5 for the Celtics since his number with the Timberwolves, number 21, was retired by the Celtics, previously worn by Bill Sharman. He made his Boston debut with a strong performance against the Washington Wizards, with 22 points and 20 rebounds. He also led all players in voting for the 2008 NBA All-Star Game. Garnett received 2,399,148 votes, the twelfth highest total in NBA All-Star balloting history. However, Garnett was unable to play due to an abdominal strain, and Detroit Pistons forward Rasheed Wallace was named to replace him. Garnett passed 20,000 points for his career, becoming the 32nd player in NBA history to reach the mark, with a layup in the second quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies on March 8. On April 22, Garnett was named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year for the 2007–08 season. It was the only major award a Celtic player had not claimed since the franchise&#x27;s foundation in 1946. Garnett said it was a team effort which helped him win the award. Garnett was also third in MVP voting for the year, behind only Kobe Bryant and Chris Paul. Garnett helped the Celtics to their 17th NBA Championship, with 26 points and 14 rebounds in Game 6 of the NBA Finals. During that championship season, Garnett and Celtics legend Bill Russell developed a relationship, which Garnett credited as a major influence in helping him succeed during his first season as a Celtic. On June 18, 2008, Garnett and Ray Allen appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, soon after winning the championship.

In the 2008–09 season, Garnett started all of the 57 games he was able to suit up for. He averaged 15.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists. On October 31, 2008, Garnett became the youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,000 career games, at 32 years and 165 days. Garnett earned his twelfth consecutive All-Star Game start on February 15, 2009. Following the All-Star Game, during a game against the Utah Jazz, Garnett injured his right knee late in the second quarter. The injury occurred on February 19, 2009, while attempting to go up for an alley-oop. He was forced to miss the next 14 games. Upon his return, he averaged nine points and 4.5 rebounds in four games before being shut down for the season, missing the final 25 games of the regular season as well as the 2009 playoffs due to his injured knee. In May 2009, he underwent knee surgery. Without Garnett, the Celtics advanced to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, but were eliminated by the Orlando Magic.

==== Final All-Star appearances and falling short (2009–2013) ====
In the 2009–10 season, Garnett and the Celtics, joined by newly signed free agent Rasheed Wallace, struggled with injuries and inconsistency throughout much of the regular season and earned the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Garnett was selected to play in the 2010 NBA All-Star Game (his 13th All-Star Game selection). Despite being written off by nearly every major sports analyst, the Celtics elevated their play and consistency, and dominated opponents much as they did during their 2008 championship run. They eliminated the Miami Heat, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Orlando Magic to advance to face the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals. In Game 6 against the Cavaliers, Garnett recorded 22 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists in the series-clinching win. The 2010 Finals went to a decisive seventh game in Los Angeles, where the Celtics led well into the third quarter before the Lakers mounted a comeback and held on for the victory.

In the 2010–11 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started strong, winning 23 of their first 26 games. On December 30, 2010, Garnett injured his right knee after he tried to dunk. He missed two weeks with the injury. Garnett returned on January 17, 2011, to face the Orlando Magic. The Celtics ended the regular season third in the Eastern Conference behind the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat. Garnett averaged under 15 points, under 9 rebounds, and a career low 0.8 blocks per game. After sweeping the New York Knicks in the first round, they faced the Heat in the semi-finals. After losing the first two games of the series, Garnett&#x27;s playoff high 28 points helped the Celtics take Game 3. However, the Heat won the next two games, winning the series 4–1.

In the lockout shortened 2011–12 NBA season, Garnett and the Celtics started off slowly, being below .500 with a 15–17 record by the All-Star break. Garnett was not selected for the All-Star game for the first time in 11 years. After, however, Boston quickly became one of the best teams in the league, finishing the second half of the season with a 24–10 record, entering the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 39–27 record. Boston made a deep run in the playoffs, going all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals. They faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, defeating them in six games. Boston then defeated the Philadelphia 76ers after a challenging seven-game series. Boston made the Eastern Conference Finals for the third time in five years, and faced another superstar trio in Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, and LeBron James of the Miami Heat. The Celtics lost the first two games, but came back strong to win the next three games. However, the Heat were too strong in Games 6 and 7, defeating the Celtics 4–3. Garnett found a resurgence in the playoffs, averaging 19.2 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.

On June 30, 2012, Garnett agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Celtics worth an estimated $34 million. On January 17, 2013, it was announced that Garnett was voted to start in the 2013 All-Star Game in Houston. On February 7, 2013, Garnett recorded his 25,000th point in a 116–95 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers.

On August 20, 2021, the Celtics announced that they would retire Garnett&#x27;s number 5 jersey on March 13, 2022, in a game against the Dallas Mavericks.

===Brooklyn Nets (2013–2015)===
On June 27, 2013, the day of the NBA draft, the Boston Celtics and the Brooklyn Nets reached a deal to trade Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry for future first-round picks in the 2014, 2016, and 2018 drafts, as well as Kris Humphries, Gerald Wallace, Kris Joseph, MarShon Brooks, and Keith Bogans. Two of the Celtics&#x27; picks eventually became future All-Stars Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. The deal was finally completed on July 12 with Brooklyn also receiving D. J. White. Garnett chose to wear number 2 to honor his deceased former Minnesota Timberwolves teammate Malik Sealy.

On December 13, 2013, Garnett surpassed 14,000 career rebounds, becoming only the tenth player in NBA history to do so. In reaching the milestone, Garnett also joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone as the only players to reach 25,000 points, 14,000 rebounds, and 5,000 assists. He reached the milestone in the third quarter of a 103–99 road loss to the Detroit Pistons. The Nets cherished Garnett&#x27;s leadership and passion. Despite boasting a starting line-up of Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Paul Pierce, and Garnett, the Nets were unable to advance past the second round of the playoffs, while Garnett finished his 19th NBA season with career low averages of 6.5 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.

On November 1, 2014, Garnett had arguably his best game for the Nets as he recorded 18 points and 14 rebounds in 35 minutes of action in the Nets&#x27; 102–90 win over the Detroit Pistons. Six days later, he recorded five rebounds in a 110–99 win over the New York Knicks and by doing so, passed Walt Bellamy for ninth place on the all-time rebounding list.

===Return to Minnesota (2015–2016)===

On February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on two-of-seven shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007. He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014–15, before sitting out the team&#x27;s final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury.

On July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two-year deal. On November 15, 2015, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd, and Elvin Hayes. On December 1, against the Orlando Magic, Garnett surpassed Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA&#x27;s career minutes list. Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points. On December 11, Garnett passed Malone as the NBA&#x27;s all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota&#x27;s 111–108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone. Garnett appeared in 38 of the team&#x27;s first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008–09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014–15 season.

On September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team&#x27;s owner that he was not sure that his knees would hold up for one more season. During his hall of fame speech Kevin Garnett lamented that his one regret about playing for the Timblerwolves was not bringing them a championship.

==National team career==
In the 2000 Summer Olympics, Garnett won a gold medal as a member of the United States national team. In his first and only FIBA tournament, Garnett averaged 10.8 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game.

==Post-playing career==
In October 2016, Garnett joined the crew on TNT&#x27;s &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;. The following month, he became the host of his own segment &quot;Area 21&quot;. In January 2017, Garnett joined the Los Angeles Clippers as a consultant. He also consulted with the Milwaukee Bucks during the 2016–17 season.

===&quot;Uncut Gems&quot;===
Garnett plays a fictionalized version of himself in the 2019 crime thriller &quot;Uncut Gems&quot;, directed by the Safdie brothers. The movie is set in 2012 and revolves around the Eastern Conference Semi-finals series between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. While playing in Philadelphia, Garnett makes a trip to a New York City jewelry store owned by Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in the Diamond District. Garnett takes a liking to an Ethiopian opal which Ratner shows off. The story revolves around Garnett&#x27;s performance in the series and relationship with the Opal, alongside Ratner&#x27;s chaotic and intense personal life.

Garnett&#x27;s performance received positive reviews from critics. The Safdie brothers picked Garnett after a series of rewrites based on available players. Prior to securing Garnett, the duo approached Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, who refused to cut his hair to match the period; and Kobe Bryant, whose representation said he wanted to direct and not act, though Bryant said he wasn&#x27;t contacted; and Joel Embiid, whose active NBA schedule could not accommodate filming. Garnett was among the first non-active athletes they approached. Garnett said the process of filming &quot;felt special, but you didn&#x27;t know it.&quot;

He then subsequently signed a deal with Village Roadshow Pictures.

==Personal life==
Garnett wore clothing branded as &quot;OBF&quot;, standing for &quot;Official Block Family.&quot; The name came from what he called his close group of friends from Beechwood Court in Mauldin, South Carolina. He brought OBF members to live with him in his Minnesota home, and let some onboard team charter flights during road trips. He met Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, the Grammy-winning record producers for Janet Jackson and Boyz II Men, early in his career in Minnesota and considers them as mentors.

In July 2004, Garnett married his longtime girlfriend Brandi Padilla during a private ceremony in California. Due to the wedding, Garnett did not take part in the Athens Olympic Games. The couple has two daughters. On July 12, 2018, Garnett&#x27;s wife filed for divorce, asking for custody of the children. Garnett is the half-brother of former basketball player Louis McCullough. Another professional basketball player, former Los Angeles Laker Shammond Williams, is his cousin.

His nicknames include &quot;The Big Ticket,&quot; &quot;KG,&quot; &quot;The Kid,&quot; and &quot;The Franchise&quot; (after being known as the Minnesota Timberwolves&#x27; franchise player). He mentally prepared himself before games by banging his head against a padded basketball stanchion. Although Garnett is officially listed as by the NBA, he is widely accepted to be at least tall. During the 2007 NBA All-Star Game, Garnett admitted in an interview with Craig Sager to be &quot;6 ft 11 in and some quarters&quot; tall. Measurements from the 1995 NBA draft indicated that Garnett, 19 years old at the time, was tall barefoot. In 1997, Garnett was measured by the Minnesota Timberwolves training staff to be tall in his basketball shoes. In December 2011, Garnett agreed to become a limited shareholder of American-owned Italian Serie A football team A.S. Roma.

In February 2021, Simon &amp; Schuster published Garnett&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;KG: A to Z: An Uncensored Encyclopedia of Life, Basketball, and Everything in Between&quot;, written with David Ritz. In the book, Garnett describes his involvement with various sneaker manufacturers.

<text>Kirribilli House is the secondary official residence of the prime minister of Australia. Located in the Northern Sydney suburb of , New South Wales, the cottage and its associated grounds are located at the far eastern end of Kirribilli Avenue. It is one of two official prime ministerial residences, the primary official residence being The Lodge in Canberra. The house, gardens and grounds are on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

Although Kirribilli was never intended to be the Prime Minister&#x27;s official primary place of residence, John Howard, Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison, all of whom were MPs for Sydney seats, have used the house as such.

==Overview==
In 1854, merchant Adolphus Frederic Feez purchased a parcel of land at the tip of Kirribilli Point for £200. The land had been sliced off the grounds of adjacent Wotonga House, which now forms part of Admiralty House, but was then in private ownership. Feez built the picturesque Gothic-style structure now known as Kirribilli House – a twin-gabled dwelling or cottage ornée – on the land&#x27;s highest spot. The house features steeply pitched roofs, fretwork, bargeboards and bay windows. It passed through many private hands until it was purchased in 1919 for £10,000 by Arthur Wigram Allen. Allen planned to subdivide the land but after much public agitation the then Prime Minister of Australia, Billy Hughes, resumed the property for Government purposes in 1920.

The property was used by the staff of the Governor-General of Australia (who occupied neighbouring Admiralty House) until 1930, when it was leased to tenants. In 1956 Kirribilli House was set aside as a residence for the use of Australia&#x27;s Prime Ministers, when they need to perform public duties and extend official hospitality on behalf of the government during stays in Sydney; the official Prime Ministerial residence is The Lodge in Canberra. Kirribilli House is situated on the North Shore of Sydney Harbour, in the suburb of Kirribilli. It commands impressive views across to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and the Sydney Opera House and has been visited over the years by many important international dignitaries.

Kirribilli House is open to the public on one day a year, courtesy of The Australiana Fund.

==History==

===Adolphus Frederic Feez===
Adolphus Frederic Feez, who built Kirribilli House in 1855, was born in Germany in 1826. He went first to London in 1849 and is listed on the Certificate of Arrival as being a merchant and an architect. In 1851 he immigrated to Sydney on the ship &quot;Envelope&quot;. He established himself as a successful merchant and was a partner in the trading company called Rabone, Feez and Co. His brother was Albrecht Feez, who later became a prominent citizen in Rockhampton.

Feez lived in Kirribilli House for several years which was then called Sophienberg. He then moved to Balmain. He married Frederica and had two children while living in Sydney. While on a business trip to Fiji he died in 1869 at the age of only 43. Frederica returned with her children to live in Germany.

===The Lawry family===

The next residents of Kirribilli House from about 1858 were Thomas and Esther Lawry. Thomas Lawry was born in 1821. He was employed by the Ordnance Department in Sydney at a young age, and remained there for the rest of his life. He was also appointed as a magistrate by the Governor. He married Esther Hughes in 1858 and the couple had two children. In 1859, the birth of a daughter at Sophienberg was recorded in the newspaper so it appears that the house continued to be called by this name after the Lawrys purchased it.

Esther Lawry’s maiden name was Esther Matilda Hosking Hughes and she was the step granddaughter of Samuel Terry, the very wealthy convict entrepreneur. In 1858, Esther inherited a considerable amount of money from her grandmother Rosetta Terry.

In 1865, Thomas Lawry died at the age of 44. The death notice records that the name of the house was still Sophienberg. Two years later in 1867, Esther married James Taylor, who was the Commissary-General of Ordnance. This couple then lived in the house with Esther’s two children, one of whom was Thomas Terry Trewyn Lawry. In 1891, James Taylor died. By this time the house had been named &quot;Kirribilli&quot; and was located in Campbell Street as the map on the left shows. In 1900, Esther died, and the house was left to her son Thomas Terry Trewyn Lawry.

Thomas Terry Trewyn Lawry was born in 1864. He seemed to have rather poor health and did not marry. In 1907, at the age of only 42 he died of heart failure. As he had no children he left his property to relatives and others. He made a very complex will leaving Kirribilli house to several people one of whom was Laura Lamotte. Laura married William Donald McCrea in 1909. Laura and William lived in the house for some time but she then wanted to sell the property. There was some disagreement about the sale with the other beneficiaries and the matter was taken to the Equity Court. The Court resolved that the property should be sold and it was put on the market in 1919. The House was bought by Arthur Wigram Allen who planned to subdivide the land. In 1920, he produced a brochure with a photo of the house and the planned subdivision. 

There was public outcry about the sale of the house and the Government under the then Prime Minister Billy Hughes decided to resume it. The property has remained in Government ownership since then.

<text>Albert Edgar Hickman (August 2, 1875 – February 9, 1943) was the seventeenth Prime Minister of Newfoundland.

==Biography==
Albert Hickman was born in Grand Bank on August 2, 1875. He married Mary Louise Laurie on December 24, 1906, and they had three children.

A politician and businessman, he served as Prime Minister of Newfoundland for 33 days in 1924 as leader of a caretaker administration after the successive collapses of the Liberal Reform Party governments of Prime Ministers Sir Richard Squires and William Warren. The governor asked Hickman to form an administration to govern the province when the government of William Warren was defeated in a Motion of No Confidence. Hickman invited members of various former members of the Liberal Reform Party as well as members of other parties into his government which he called the Liberal-Progressive Party. His new party was defeated in the 9 June 1924 election by former supporters of Warren who joined with the conservative opposition to form the Liberal-Conservative Progressive Party. Hickman served as Leader of the Opposition until he retired from politics in 1928, by which time his party had degenerated and a new Liberal Party had emerged led by Squires.

Albert Hickman died at his home in St. John&#x27;s on February 9, 1943.

<text>The Grand Central Hotel, later renamed the Broadway Central Hotel, was a hotel at 673 Broadway, New York City, that was famous as the site of the murder of financier James Fisk in 1872 by Edward S. Stokes.

The hotel collapsed on August 3, 1973, killing four residents and injuring at least twelve.

==History==
This hotel, which opened in 1870, was designed by Henry Engelbert, and was commissioned by Elias S. Higgins, a local carpet manufacturer. The hotel&#x27;s facade was reminiscent of Engelbert&#x27;s Grand Hotel on Broadway and West 31st Street, which was also commissioned by Higgins. Both of these hotels by Engelbert were characterized by elaborate mansards with dormers in the French Second Empire style, although the Grand Central Hotel was clearly the larger and more elaborate of the two.

THE LARGEST HOTEL IN AMERICA

Few people who pass through Broadway are aware that on that bustling thoroughfare, between Amity and Bleecker streets, there is now in course of erection, on the site of the old Lafarge Hotel, one of the largest and most magnificent hotels on the Western Continent, which, when completed, will throw in the shade the largest hotels in this country - rivalling even the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; at Paris in magnificence. Since the disastrous fire in April, 1867, which destroyed the Winter Garden Theatre, under the Lafarge House, that hotel has been closed.

In March last it was sold at public auction by the heirs of the Lafarge estate E. S. Higgins, Esq., who is recorded fourth on the list of wealthy citizens for the sum of $1,000,000. This gentleman determined on erecting the largest hotel in the country, and will doubtless succeed, as when completed the new hotel will contain 630 rooms, 200 more than either the Fifth Avenue, Metropolitan or St. Nicholas Hotel, and 100 more than the celebrated Lindell Hotel at St. Louis, which was burned some three years ago; 200 of the rooms will be parlors en suite. It is to be named the Southern Hotel, and is designed to accommodate 1,200 guests. It will be eight stories in height, surmounted by three gothic towers on the Broadway front. Three elevators, which will perform the trip from the first floor to the attic in thirty seconds, will be in use for the benefit of guests night and day. One item alone - upholstery and furniture - will involve an expenditure of $1,000,000. The articles mentioned having been ordered from Paris and this city.

The halls and rooms will require carpeting sufficient to cover seven acres [28,000 m²], and will be of the finest quality - Brussels and velvet. All the rooms will be heated with steam, and on each floor hydrants, hose, and everything necessary will be furnished to extinguish fire. There will be three large dining-rooms extending from the main hall on the second story to the Mercer street wall, the largest of which will accommodate 500 guests. There are at present 350 men employed on the building, and the contractor calculates that he will complete it by the 1st of June next but the hotel will not be open for the reception of guests until the following August. When completed, it will have cost the proprietor $1,600,000.
On February 2, 1876, 8 baseball teams formed what became the National League of Major League Baseball at the Grand Central Hotel. The event was celebrated at the league&#x27;s 50 and 75th anniversaries at the hotel.

==Collapse==
On August 3, 1973, allegedly due in part to illegal alterations on a basement bearing wall, a section of the Broadway facade of the structure, then known as the University Hotel, collapsed onto Broadway, killing four residents of the hotel. By this time the building had deteriorated into a welfare hotel, but it housed Art Bar, a successor for a brief time as a venue for the artists and sculptors who had congregated at Max&#x27;s Kansas City. On the Mercer Street side of the hotel there was the Mercer Arts Center, a complex of live theaters operated by Sy and Cynthia Kaback. The collapse occurred just hours before the theaters were due to be filled with hundreds of patrons. The remains of the hotel were demolished, and New York University subsequently built a 22-story dormitory for law students on the site.

<text>Admiralty House is the official residence of the governor-general of Australia in Sydney. It is located in the suburb of Kirribilli, on the northern foreshore of Sydney Harbour, and adjacent to Kirribilli House, which serves as the Sydney residence of the Australian Prime Minister. The large Victorian Regency and Italianate sandstone manor, completed in stages based on designs by James Barnet and Walter Liberty Vernon, occupies the tip of Kirribilli Point. Once known as &quot;Wotonga&quot;, it has commanding views across Sydney Harbour to the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. Admiralty House is regarded as the secondary residence of the governor-general, the main residence being Government House in Canberra, also known as Yarralumla.

Its current name originates in the fact that it served as the residence for the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australian Squadron from 1885 to 1913.

The original building on the site was completed, as a private dwelling, in mid-to-late 1843, by John George Nathaniel Gibbes, the then Collector of Customs for New South Wales and a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. A portrait of Gibbes, painted in 1808, hangs in the house.

On 22 June 2004 Admiralty House was placed on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

==History==
===Early history===
Before the arrival of British settlers in Sydney Harbour, the Aboriginal Cammeraygal people lived along the Kirribilli and Milsons Point foreshores, and in the surrounding bushland. The area was a fertile fishing ground, and the name Kirribilli is derived from the Aboriginal word &quot;kiarabilli&quot;, which means &quot;good fishing spot&quot;. The name Cammeraygal is displayed on the North Sydney Municipal Council emblem, and also gave name to the suburb of Cammeray.

Kirribilli was settled early in the history of the Colony. One of the first records of land being granted on the North Shore was on the &quot;North side of the Harbour of Port Jackson opposite Sydney Cove&quot; on 20 February 1794 to an expired convict, Samuel Lightfoot. Lightfoot was a former convict, born in about 1763 and transported to Australia for seven years for stealing clothing. He arrived with the First Fleet in 1788 on the &quot;Charlotte&quot;.

In 1794 Thomas Muir, a Scottish constitutional reformer, was sentenced to transportation for sedition. Thomas Muir purchased Lightfoot&#x27;s farm. Muir also had a cottage on what is now Circular Quay. It is likely that the farm was located at the Jeffrey Street end of Kirribilli (not near Admiralty House) and was named &quot;Huntershill&quot; by Thomas Muir, after his father&#x27;s home in Scotland. Thomas Muir escaped from the colony in 1796 aboard an American brig, the &quot;Otter&quot;.

Four years later the Colonial Secretary recorded that the land grant to Lightfoot was cancelled and given to Robert Ryan in 1800 with no mention of the intermediate (private) sale to Muir. Ryan had worked in Norfolk Island, both as a soldier and also a settler. The of Lightfoot&#x27;s Grant was cancelled and included in a grant to Ryan for his service in the Royal Marines and the New South Wales Corps. The corresponding entry in the Register of Land Grants states &quot; Cancelled, and a New Grant given to Robert Ryan for 90 acres in addition to this Allotment, by Governor John Hunter. See the third Register, Folio 37.&quot; This grant to Ryan included almost all Kirribilli and later maps referred. By 1801, the property had passed into the hands of Robert Campbell, a wealthy Sydney merchant. Campbell built Australia&#x27;s first shipbuilding yards in 1807, at the site that is now occupied by the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, Kirribilli. Part of the land in Kirribilli was also briefly used for quarantine purposes in 1814 for the convict ship &quot;Surry&quot;. Over 46 persons had died during the voyage of typhoid including 36 convicts.

Campbell&#x27;s property in Kirribilli was used for grazing under lease to Campbell&#x27;s friend James Milson, hence the name &quot;Milson&#x27;s Point&quot;. Milson&#x27;s Point is the next point along from Kirribilli point, where the Sydney Harbour Bridge now crosses the harbour. A plan of sub-division was drawn up in the 1840s by Campbell. In 1842, the site where Admiralty House now sits was leased to the Collector of Customs for the Colony, Lieutenant-Colonel (later full Colonel) Gibbes, MLC. Gibbes intended to build a private home on the site. (Since his arrival in the colony in 1834, Gibbes and his family had been living in Henrietta Villa, also known as the Naval Villa, on Sydney&#x27;s Point Piper, under a leasehold arrangement.)

===Private residence===

On the superb Kirribilli Point location, Gibbes erected, between 1842 and 1843, a graceful single-storey house with wide verandahs and elegant French doors. Gibbes designed the house, which he called &quot;Wotonga&quot; (or &quot;Woottonga&quot;), himself. The stone for the house&#x27;s walls was quarried locally and the hardwood and cedar joinery came from George Coleson&#x27;s timber-yard in George Street, Sydney. Gibbes engaged James Hume, a well-known builder who dabbled in ecclesiastical architecture, to supervise the construction of the building and its stables. Gibbes, however, hired his own masons, bricklayers, carpenters, plumbers and ironmongers to work on the project, paying each of them separately as work progressed. Gibbes used the Custom Department&#x27;s cutter to commute to and from the building site. Once completed, Gibbes&#x27; L-shaped residence featured a plain, yet stylish, double façade to maximise the building&#x27;s magnificent, sweeping views across Sydney Harbour. These views enabled Gibbes to monitor shipping traffic in and out of Darling Harbour and, more importantly, Circular Quay, where the Sydney Customs House was situated.

Today, Wotonga forms the core of Admiralty House and the building&#x27;s 180-degree, east–west panoramic sight-lines are even more spectacular than they were in Gibbes&#x27; day, owing to the subsequent high-rise growth of Sydney&#x27;s CBD.

Gibbes, incidentally, was said to be the illegitimate child of Frederick, Duke of York, (King George III&#x27;s second son). This reputed connection to the British monarchy adds spice to the house on Kirribilli Point&#x27;s subsequent role as a vice-regal establishment.

In 1849, Robert Campbell died and the executors of the estate sold the property, comprising the house and land, to Gibbes for about A£1,400. On 27 December 1851, Gibbes, who was contemplating a departure from the Customs Service at the age of 64, sold the property to James Lindsay Travers, a merchant of Macquarie Place, Sydney, for £1,533. (Gibbes subsequently changed his mind about leaving his position as head of the NSW Customs Department; instead, he leased Greycliffe House at Shark Beach, Vaucluse, from the Wentworth family and remained in Sydney for the better part of eight years, eventually retiring to Yarralumla homestead, now the official Canberra residence of the Governor-General of Australia, in 1859.)

A small portion of the Kirribilli Point land, a little over was sold by Travers in 1854 to a merchant, Adolph Frederic Feez. On this land, Kirribilli House was built in neo-Gothic style . Kirribilli House, situated next door to Admiralty House, serves today as the official Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia.

====Crimean War interlude====
In 1855, during the Crimean War, Governor William Denison reclaimed the tip of Kirribilli Point, on which fortifications were built. These fortifications, along with Fort Denison, were intended to strengthen the defences of Sydney Harbour, as it was feared that the Russians might attack. In 1856, Lieutenant-Colonel George Barney, a Royal Engineers officer, lived in &quot;Wotonga&quot; and designed and supervised the installation of a battery of five, muzzle-loading guns on Kirribilli Point, as well as constructing the martello tower at Fort Denison.

====Lassetter, Wilshire, and Cadell====

In 1856, Lieutenant-Colonel Barney bought the house and its grounds so that he could view all of the sites that he had fortified. In September 1860, Barney sold the house and grounds for £9,000 to George Alfred Lloyd. In 1866, it was let to Frederick Lassetter and subsequently to James Robert Wilshire, a former Lord Mayor of Sydney and a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1858 to 1861.

In April 1874, Wotonga House was auctioned and bought for £10,100 by Thomas Cadell, a Sydney merchant and member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1881 to 1896. At that time, the house was described as possessing a wide verandah, a spacious entrance hall, drawing and dining rooms, 10 bedrooms and the &quot;&#x27;usual rooms&quot;&quot; in the main part of the house, as well as having a large courtyard, servants&#x27; rooms, kitchen, stables, etc., with an abundant water supply, which never failed in the driest weather.

===Admiralty===
In 1885, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australian Squadron was raised to the status of an admiral&#x27;s command in recognition of the colony&#x27;s growing importance and the colonial government bought &quot;Wotonga&quot; as his residence. The house was renamed &quot;Admiralty House&quot; and additions were made to the property. A second storey was added to the house, as was a colonnaded verandah. A neo-Gothic style gate lodge was also added to the grounds, as was a covered Admiral&#x27;s Walk leading down to the berth for the Admiral&#x27;s barge below.

In 1913, this part of the history of Admiralty House came to a close when the last British admiral left the house and the Royal Australian Navy took over responsibility for the naval defence of Australia.

From the Federation of Australia in 1901, the Government House of New South Wales in Farm Cove was used as the Sydney residence of the Governor-General. In 1912, the Government of New South Wales decided to put the building to public purposes once more, leaving the Governor-General of the period, Lord Denman, without a Sydney residence.

===Government House===
With the departure of the last British admiral from Admiralty House in 1913, the Admiralty handed the house back to the New South Wales Government. This provided Lord Denman&#x27;s successor, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, with a Sydney residence. Admiralty House was the residence of the Governors-General for the following fifteen years. 

In 1930, during the Great Depression, the Scullin ministry had Admiralty House closed, and its contents were sold at Auction in 1931. Governor-General Sir Isaac Isaacs, appointed in 1931, was the first Governor-General to live permanently at Yarralumla, in Canberra. During his term, Admiralty House remained empty and neglected. Sir Isaac described it in 1934 as being &quot;stripped of its glamour, with no furnishings but a few fine mirrors, its garden wild and overgrown&quot;. In 1936, the State of New South Wales reopened Admiralty House as the Sydney residence for the new Governor-General, Lord Gowrie. The house has been used ever since as a vice-regal establishment.

Formal title to Admiralty House finally passed from the State Government to the Commonwealth by Crown grant in 1948, on the condition that the house was to be used only as a residence for the Governor-General.

==Functions==

Admiralty House is an official residence of the Governor-General of Australia, and accommodates important overseas visitors to Sydney. The Royal Family and other dignitaries, such as the President of the United States and the Pope, are entertained at Admiralty House when they are in Sydney.

Admiralty House, its grounds, and Kirribilli House are usually open to the public once a year, sometime in spring when the gardens are at their best. Security concerns caused the cancellation of openings from 2001 to 2005.

==Architecture==

===Interior===
The ground floor of the house contains a vestibule and hallway, two reception rooms, a dining-room, a study and an elaborate central staircase. The residents&#x27; private rooms are on the upper floors. A landing on the staircase features elaborate stained glass panels in its windows. Kitchens and other service areas are housed in a wing added to the original structure. A stone gatehouse guards the front entrance to the establishment.

The house is furnished extensively with colonial furniture, porcelain, ornaments and numerous historical artworks such as portraits of Captain James Cook and some former Governors-General, including Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson. Many of these items were acquired for the nation by The Australiana Fund.

<text>The Berlin S-Bahn () is a rapid transit railway system in and around Berlin, the capital city of Germany. It has been in operation under this name since December 1930, having been previously called the special tariff area (&#x27;Berlin city, orbital, and suburban railways&#x27;). It complements the Berlin U-Bahn and is the link to many outer-Berlin areas, such as Berlin Brandenburg Airport. As such, the Berlin S-Bahn blends elements of a commuter rail service and a rapid transit system.

In its first decades of operation, the trains were steam-drawn; even after the electrification of large parts of the network, some lines remained under steam. Today, the term &quot;S-Bahn&quot; is used in Berlin only for those lines and trains with third-rail electrical power transmission and the special Berlin S-Bahn loading gauge. The third unique technical feature of the Berlin S-Bahn, the automated mechanical train control (works very similar to the train stop at New York City Subway), is being phased out and replaced by a communications-based train control system specific to the Berlin S-Bahn.

In other parts of Germany and other German-speaking countries, other trains are designated &quot;S-Bahn&quot; without those Berlin-specific features. The Hamburg S-Bahn is the only other system using third-rail electrification.

Today, the &quot;Berlin S-Bahn&quot; is no longer defined as this special tariff area of the national railway company, but is instead just one specific means of transportation, defined by its special technical characteristics, in an area-wide tariff administered by a public transport authority. The Berlin S-Bahn is now an integral part of the , the regional tariff zone for all kinds of public transit in and around Berlin and the federal state () of Brandenburg.

==Introduction==

The brand name &quot;S-Bahn&quot; chosen in 1930 mirrored &quot;U-Bahn&quot;, which had become the official brand name for the Berlin city-owned rapid transit lines begun under the name of (&#x27;Berlin elevated and underground lines&#x27;), where the word of mouth had abbreviated to , in parallel to formed from (&#x27;undersea boat&#x27; – submarine). Ironically, S-Bahn&#x27;s S is not easy to name, it may stand for (&#x27;rapid rail&#x27;) or (&#x27;urban rail&#x27;; not to be confused with , a railway line through Berlin on which some Berlin S-Bahn lines run, or , the German term for light rail).

Services on the Berlin S-Bahn have been provided by the Prussian or German national railway company of the respective time, which means the after the First World War, the state-owned East German (in both East and West Berlin) until 1993 (except West Berlin from 1984 to 1994, the BVG period) and after its incorporation in 1994.

The Berlin S-Bahn consists today of 16 lines serving 166 stations, and runs over a total route length of . The S-Bahn carried 478.1 million passengers in 2018. It is integrated with the mostly underground U-Bahn to form the backbone of Berlin&#x27;s rapid transport system. Unlike the U-Bahn, the S-Bahn crosses Berlin city limits into the surrounding state of Brandenburg, e.g. to Potsdam.

Although the S- and U-Bahn are part of a unified fare system, they have different operators. The S-Bahn is operated by , a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, whereas the U-Bahn is run by Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), the main public transit company for the city of Berlin.

== Operation ==

=== Network ===
The S-Bahn routes all feed into one of three core lines: a central, elevated east–west line (the ), a central, mostly underground north–south line (the ), and a circular line (the ). Outside the , suburban routes radiate in all directions.

Lines S1, S2, S25, and S26 are north–south lines that use the north–south tunnel as their midsection. They were equally distributed into Oranienburg, Bernau, and Hennigsdorf in the north, and Teltow Stadt, Lichtenrade, and Wannsee.

Lines S3, S5, S7, S9, and S75 are east–west lines using the cross-city railway. The western termini are located at Potsdam and Spandau, although the S5 only runs as far as Westkreuz and the S75 to . The eastern termini are Erkner, Strausberg Nord, Ahrensfelde, and Wartenberg. The S9 uses a connector curve () at to switch from the to the south-eastern leg of the . Another curve, the to the north-eastern , was originally served by the S86 line, but it was demolished in preparation of the rebuilding of station and was not rebuilt afterwards. Both connector curves were heavily used in the time of the Berlin Wall, as trains coming from the north-eastern routes couldn&#x27;t use the West Berlin north–south route and the Southern leg of the pre- and post-Wall was in West Berlin.

Lines S41 and S42 continuously circle around the , the former clockwise, the latter anti-clockwise. Lines S45, S46, and S47 link destinations in the southeast with the southern section of the via the tangential link from the to the via Köllnische Heide.

Lines S8 and S85 are north–south lines using the eastern section of the between and Treptower Park via Ostkreuz, using the in the South.

Formerly, there existed four curves at and allowing to go to a northern ring () and to a southern ring () using central tracks of . and are common terms, but never scheduled routes as separate rings. One curve of at left over for internal use, the other one is mentioned connector at .

=== Routes ===
Generally speaking, the first digit of a route number denotes the main route or a group of routes. Thus, S25 is a branch of S2, while S41, S42, S45, S46, and S47 are all routes that share some of the same route. So S41, S42, S45, S46, and S47 are together S4. However, the S4 does not exist as an independent entity.

Since 9 January 1984, all the West Berlin S-Bahn routes are labelled with an &quot;S&quot; followed by a number. This system had been in use with other West German S-Bahn systems (such as Hamburg) for years. On 2 June 1991 this was extended to the East Berlin lines as well. Internally, the Berlin S-Bahn uses (literally groups of trains) which normally run every twenty minutes (S41/S42 are an exception to this as their run every 10 minutes). Some lines, e.g. the S85, are made up of only one , while others, like S5, are actually multiple combined. Some do not run the entire line and terminate at intermediate stops. are called by a (radio designator), which is derived from the German spelling alphabet. Some are not used in regular service, such as Heinrich, Baikal, Jaguar, Gustav, or Saale (being used for special soccer service trains, usually running for fans under the line S3 between and ).
Stations in brackets are serviced at certain times only (Monday through Friday during offpeak in the case of and during peak in the case of and ). only runs Monday through Friday.

Also, not every train reaches the nominal terminus of a line. For example, every other train on runs only to Frohnau, five stops before Oranienburg, and the last stop on towards Erkner which is reached by every train is Friedrichshagen. Similarly, some northbound trains terminate at Gesundbrunnen, and most trains run only to Strausberg or even Mahlsdorf, rendering Strausberg Nord the least served stop on the whole network.

====Route changes in 2009====

On 31 August 2009 a few semi-permanent changes to the line routes were applied. Because of renovations to station, including dismantling the tracks connecting the and the –
* (formerly ↔ Spandau) could not turn west at this station any more. The line thus followed the and then branches northwards past , like and , and terminated at Pankow.
*To compensate for the diminished throughput on the , the (formerly Erkner ↔ ) was extended westwards to Spandau.

====Route changes in 2012====
Because of the progress achieved in the renovation in 2012, the –
* was shortened to operate only between and Erkner.
* was extended to Spandau.
* operated every 10 minutes between and .

====Route changes in 2017====
On 21 August 2017, with the completion of the renovation, and on 10 December 2017, with the completion of the connection between the and at , the following changes were made:

* was introduced, operating from to , to replace lost S85 service on 10 December 2017.
* was extended from back to on 21 August 2017, and was further extended to Spandau on 10 December 2017, replacing the S5.
* was shortened from Spandau to on 10 December 2017.
* was shortened from back to on 5 October 2017, and was further truncated to Ostkreuz on 10 December 2017.
* was diverted from to Pankow, replacing the S9 on 10 December 2017.
* was diverted from Pankow to Spandau on 10 December 2017 replacing the previous S5 service.

=== Service hours ===
The S-Bahn generally operates between 4am and 1am Monday to Friday, between 5am and 1am on Saturdays and between 6:30am and 1am on Sundays during normal daytime service. However, there is a comprehensive night-time service on most lines between 1am and 5am on Saturdays and 01:00 and 06:30 on Sundays, which means that most stations enjoy a continuous service between Friday morning and Sunday evening. One exception to this is the section of the between and which sees no service in these hours. Most other lines operate without route changes, but some are curtailed or extended during nighttime. Particularly, the , , , , , , , are unchanged, and the and have no nighttime service. Westbound lines , , , and northbound terminate at stations , , , and Treptower Park, respectively.
== History ==

=== From the beginnings till the end of World War II ===
With individual sections dating from the 1870s, the S-Bahn was formed in time as the network of suburban commuter railways running into Berlin, then interconnected by the circular railway connecting the various terminal railway stations, and in 1882 enhanced by the east–west cross-city line (called the , &#x27;city railway&#x27;). The forming of a distinct identity for this network began with the establishment of a special tariff for the area which was then called the , and which differed from the normal railway tariff. While the regular railway tariff was based on multiplying the distance covered with a fixed price per kilometre, the special tariff for this Berlin tariff zone was based on a graduated tariff based on the number of stations touched during the travel.

The core of this network, that is the cross-city () east–west line and the circular , and several suburban branches were converted from steam operation to a third-rail electric railway in the latter half of the 1920s. The Wannsee railway, the suburban line with the highest number of passengers, was electrified in 1932–33. A number of suburban trains remained steam-hauled, even after the Second World War.

After building the east–west cross-city line connecting western suburban lines, which until then terminated at &quot;Charlottenburg&quot; station with eastern suburban lines which had terminated at (later ), the logical next step was a north–south cross-city line connecting the northern suburban lines terminating at with the southern suburban lines terminating at the subsidiary stations of the Berlin Potsdamer Bahnhof. The first ideas for this project emerged only 10 years after the completion of the east–west cross-city line, with several concrete proposals resulting from a 1909 competition held by the Berlin city administration. Another concrete proposal, already very close to the final realisation, was put forward in 1926 by Professor Jenicke of Breslau university.

Many sections of the S-Bahn were closed during the war, both through enemy action and flooding of the tunnel on 2 May 1945 during the final Battle of Berlin. The exact number of casualties is not known, but up to 200 people are presumed to have perished, since the tunnel was used as a public shelter and also served to house military wounded in trains on underground sidings. Service through the tunnel commenced again in 1947.

=== The time of expansion ===

==== Before the construction of Berlin Wall ====

After hostilities ceased in 1945, Berlin was given special status as a &quot;Four-Sector City&quot;, surrounded by the Soviet Occupation Zone, which later became the German Democratic Republic (GDR). The Allies had decided that S-Bahn service in the western sectors of Berlin should continue to be provided by the (DR), which was by now the provider of railway services in East Germany. (Rail services in West Germany proper were provided by the new .)

Before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the Berlin S-Bahn had grown to about . On the 13 August 1961, it was the biggest turning point in the operation and network for the S-Bahn.

As relations between East and West began to sour with the coming of the Cold War, the S-Bahn had become the victim of the hostilities. Although services continued operating through all occupation sectors, checkpoints were constructed on the borders with East Berlin and on-board &quot;customs checks&quot; were carried out on trains. From 1958 onward, some S-Bahn trains ran non-stop through the western sectors from stations in East Berlin to stations on outlying sections in East Germany so as to avoid the need for such controls. East German government employees were then forbidden to use the S-Bahn since it travelled through West Berlin.

==== After the construction of Berlin Wall ====

The S-Bahn has also been operated in two separate subnets of the . In East Berlin, the S-Bahn retained a transport share of approximately 35 percent, the mode of transport with the highest passenger share. In the 1970s and 1980s the route network continued to grow. In particular, the new housing estates were connected to the grid in the northeast of the city ( and ).

The construction of the Berlin Wall led to West Berlin calling for the unions and politicians to boycott the S-Bahn. Subsequently, passenger numbers fell.

However, the Berlin S-Bahn strike brought the S-Bahn to the attention of the public, and aroused the desire for West Berlin to manage its section of the S-Bahn itself. In 1983 negotiations of representatives of the Senate, the SNB and the took place. In December 1983, these were concluded with Allied consent to the agreement between the and the Berlin Senate for the transfer of operating rights of the S-Bahn in the area of West Berlin. The BVG received the oldest carriages from the DR; but the BVG was eager to quickly get to modern standards for a subway. Therefore, soon new S-Bahn trains were purchased on their behalf, which are still in use on the Berlin S-Bahn network as the 480 series.

Even before the Wall fell, there were efforts to substantial re-commissioning of the S-Bahn network in West Berlin.

=== Reunification ===
After the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, the first broken links were re-established, with on 1 July 1990 as the first. The BVG and DR jointly marketed the services soon after the reunification. Administratively, the divided S-Bahn networks remained separate in this time of momentous changes, encompassing German reunification and reunification of Berlin into a single city, although the dividing line was no longer the former Berlin Wall. DR and BVG (of the whole of reunified Berlin from 1 January 1992, after absorbing BVB of East Berlin) operated individual lines end to end, both into the other party&#x27;s territories. For example, S2 was all BVG even after it was extended northward and southward into Brandenburg/former East German territory. The main east–west route () was a joint operation. Individual trains were operated by either BVG or DR end-to-end on the same tracks. This arrangement ended on 1 January 1994, with the creation of due to the merger between DR and the former West Germany&#x27;s . All S-Bahn operations in Berlin were transferred to the newly formed as a subsidiary of , and the BVG withdrew from running S-Bahn services.

Technically, a number of projects followed in the steps of re-establishing broken links in order to restore the former S-Bahn network to its 1961 status after 1990, especially the . In December 1997 the connection between and Treptower Park via was reopened, enabling S4 trains to run 75% of the whole ring between and . On 16 June 2002, the section  – also reopened, re-establishing the Ringbahn operations.

==Tendering programme for the Berlin S-Bahn==

MTR Corporation, National Express, Berlin S-Bahn GmbH and RATP Development tendered for their procurement process, and were soon followed by train manufacturer Stadler Rail for their operations from 2018 to 2033. The specific contracts are:
*S41 Südkreuz – Südkreuz (clockwise Ring)
*S42 Südkreuz – Südkreuz (anticlockwise Ring)
*S46 Westend – Königs Wusterhausen
*S47 Spindlersfeld – Hermannstraße – (Südkreuz)
*S8 Birkenwerder – (Grünau) – Zeuthen
*S3 Erkner – Spandau
*S5 Westkreuz – Strausberg-Nord
*S7 Ahrensfelde – (Wannsee) – Potsdam HBF
*S75 Wartenberg – Warschauer Straße 
*S9 Flughafen BER Airport – Spandau
*S1 Wannsee – Oranienburg
*S2 Blankenfelde – Bernau
*S25 Teltow Stadt – Hennigsdorf
*S26 Teltow Stadt – Waidmannslust
*S45 Flughafen BER Airport – Südkreuz
*S85 Grünau – Pankow

== Depots ==
There were several depots for Berlin S-Bahn. They are (opened in December 1927), (opened on 1 March 1903), Grünau (opened on 1 April 1910), Wannsee (opened on 15 May 1933), Erkner (opened in 1928) and (opened in 1925).

At Grünau, construction began in 1916 and was completed in 1928. They serviced the following routes:

*Grünau – Südring – Stadtbahn – Lichtenberg
*Grünau – Stadtbahn – Spandau West
*Grünau – Nordring – Gartenfeld (nur HVZ)

The connection to Spandau West became in the following years the traditional train course, which was maintained after 1945 until the building of the wall. In the 1980s, this depot made 51 daily trains for the connections using Class 485 trains.
*Zeuthen – Ostring – Bernau
*Königs Wusterhausen – Stadtbahn – Friedrichstraße – Stadtbahn – Erkner – Stadtbahn – Friedrichstraße
*Flughafen Berlin-Schönefeld – Stadtbahn – Friedrichstraße
*Spindlersfeld – Ostring – Blankenburg

Closed depots include:
*Stettiner Bahnhof
*Papestraße
*Westend
*Bernau
*Hundekehle
*Velten
*Yorckstraße

== Rolling stock ==

===Current===
* BVG Class 480 (since 1986, in use on line S3)
* DB Class 481/482 (since 1996, in use on lines S1, S2, S25, S26, S3, S41, S42, S45, S5, S7, S75, S85 and S9)
* Class 483/484 (since 2021, in use on line S41, S42, S46, S47 and S8)

===Former===
* DRG Class ET 125 (from 1935 until 2003)
* DRG Class ET 165 (from 1928 until 1997)
* DRG Class ET 166 (from 1936 until 2000)
* DRG Class ET 167 (from 1938 until 2003)
* DRG Class ET 168 (from 1926 until about 1962, some units converted to train type EIII for the Berlin U-Bahn)
* DRG Class ET 169 (from 1925 until 1962)
* DR Class ET 170 (from 1959 until 1970)
* DR Class 485/885 (from 1987 until 2023)

=== Special Trains ===
This vehicle, DB Class 488.0 (&quot;Panorama train&quot;) is a unique piece. The train consists of two railcars and a sidecar in between. It was created by conversion from old cars of the ET / EB 167, the later series 477/877. While the car body is largely a new build, many technical components of end-of-life vehicles were taken over in 1997–99. This train is not used in normal regular service. The S-Bahn offered city tours with it until 2009, and it could be rented privately. The train is equipped with a modern multimedia system so that the announcements via headphones can be followed in multiple languages. As with this car the windows extend into the roof for a better field of vision, it is called a panorama train (previously known as a panoramic suburban train).

Otherwise museum and tradition trains were primarily used – Class 165. The Viertel train Class ET/EB 167s were being built in 1938 and was converted in 1991.

== Expansion ==

=== Redevelopment projects ===

====Ostkreuz====

In 1988, presented plans for the transformation of station. The long postponed renovation of the station began in 2007.

With nine lines (four on the and five on the ), is one of the busiest stations on the network.

With the progress of construction work on 31 August 2009, the southern connection and platform A were decommissioned. This route had to be realigned as a result. The construction plans envisaged that the connection would be restored by 2014. After its completion, traffic will again be able to be run from the southern onto the .

In October 2009, the new station on the was sufficiently complete for S-Bahn trains on the to use it temporarily. Demolition of the platform could then start and the new platform, including a concourse, could be built. This was put into operation on 16 April 2012, after a 16-day track closure.

In December 2018 all the S-Bahn tracks at finished construction and were opened for regular passenger use.

====Berlin–Görlitz railway (–)====

Rehabilitation work at Grünauer Kreuz on the Berlin–Görlitz railway began on 12 July 2006. In 2010 and 2011, rebuilt stations were put into operation in several stages at and Adlershof and the bridges over the Britz Canal and the Teltow Canal were replaced. During the reconstruction, the platform at Adlershof was relocated directly above (street).

Other major construction projects are planned along the route:
*Rebuilding of Schöneweide station, including the construction of a new road underpass
*Replacement of bridges over Sterndamm (street)
*Construction of additional electronic interlocking equipment along the route
*Conversion of Wildau station
*Renewal of the mainline tracks and the re-establishment of the overhead contact line system

==== Berlin-Schönefeld Airport-Berlin Brandenburg Airport extension ====

In preparation for the opening of Berlin-Brandenburg Airport in Schönefeld in the south of Berlin, S-Bahn lines S45 and S9 were set to be extended from the then terminus at Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport in a long curve to the new terminal. Directly below the terminal, Berlin Brandenburg, a station has been built with six platform tracks. Four through platform tracks are provided for long-distance services. Two tracks are operated by S-Bahn services on the approach from the west. In early July 2008, the first 185-metre-long section of the station was completed so that the terminal could be built. On 24 July 2009, the airport company transferred the completed shell of the airport railway station and the first part of the tunnel to DB. The new line includes the stations of and and has a length of approximately 7.8 kilometres. The construction cost was specified as €636 million. This amount also included the cost of construction of long-distance tracks.

In 2020 the Berlin Brandenburg Airport was opened with a 9-year delay. With the opening of the airport, the S-Bahn service also began operation, which meant that the lines S45 and S9 were extended as was planned more than 10 years ago.

====Planning of line S21 (Second : first stage)====
The second will link the northern ring to the , Potsdamer Platz station and the Wannsee Railway to the southern ring. Today&#x27;s plans are almost identical to plans submitted to the 1907–1910 &quot;Greater Berlin&quot; competition by Albert Sprickerhof. Since then, there have been a number of alternatives proposals for such a route. A similar line was included in the plans for (&#x27;World Capital Germania&#x27;) in the 1930s.

The line will be built in sections. In 2005, the zoning approval for the northern part of the route from the to was adopted. In October 2009 a loan agreement was entered into between the Senate and for the first section. This provided for total costs of €226.5 million. On 27 November 2009, the preparatory work for this phase of construction started at the Hauptbahnhof. For the underground excavation in , diaphragm walls were built into the ground and the trench in between was covered with a reinforced concrete lid.

This stage involves the construction of a curve to the and an eastern connection to inside the northern . Structural preparation for these junctions to these lines had already been made during the construction of the North–South mainline in 2006. From there, the existing line will run in a southerly direction (in the tunnel layer) to the east of the North–South mainline. The realization of an intermediate station under the working name of (as a two-level station in a V-shape) is provided as an option. It was proposed to complete this 1,600-meter-long section by 2016. After construction delays caused by the inflow of groundwater, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global supply chain crisis, the opening is planned for 2024 at the earliest.

==== Planning of line S21 (Second : second stage) ====

The construction of the second section of the S21 is to begin no earlier than 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2023. The new S-Bahn line will run in a tunnel from near the past the Reichstag to Potsdamer Platz. It will run next to the existing to Brandenburg Gate and separate from it to run to Potsdamer Platz. The first north–south S-Bahn tunnel was designed in 1939 with room for an additional two tracks at Potsdamer Platz and to its south for the new line. The cost of the S-Bahn line (phases 1 and 2) has been estimated at €317 million (2009 prices). The benefits of additional expenditure to the east of the Reichstag are still under investigation. This would increase the cost to about €330 million.

There are currently no dates set for the other phases of construction to the southern . It has so far only been defined in the Berlin land use plan.

=== Proposals for further extensions ===
Since reunification, there have been suggestions that lines that have not been used since 1961 or 1980 should be rebuilt and connected to the network by some new lines. Many of these plans have changed several times since then or have been abandoned.

Following a decision of the Berlin House of Representatives, the goal is essentially to restore the S-Bahn network to its extent in 1961. This was stated in an agreement between , the Federal Ministry of Transport and the Senate on 4 November 1993. The network was to be restored by 2002. On this basis, the plans were included in the land use plan of 1995. In a study of the transport development by the then Department for Transport and Commerce in 1995, a plan was published for a network. Only the , and sections, which had existed until 1980, were not incorporated in these plans. This political commitment is now only symbolic as some projects are now aimed at points beyond the original destinations or to miss them entirely. Budgetary difficulties, changing traffic flows and alternative development projects using trains have led to the cancellation or postponement of projects that had already been developed.

==Accidents==

Since the foundation of the Berlin S-Bahn, a number of accidents have occurred.
*On 15 December 1945, there was a head-on collision between a S-Bahn and a Nahgüterzug (local freight train) on the single-track Schöneweide–Spindlersfeld branch line. There were four dead and one seriously injured. The accident was caused by human error on the part of the dispatcher, who forgot the local freight train coming from Spindlersfeld and due to missing automatic block signaling and allowed a S-Bahn journey to Spindlersfeld.
*On August 15, 1948, a train arriving from Oranienburger Straße in the north-south S-Bahn tunnel collided with a stopped train in the curve of the Spree underpass. 63 people were injured. The reason given was that the railcar personnel did not exercise the required care for &quot;line of sight&quot; operation, by driving at about in a blind curve. Both were initially dismissed without notice, but were acquitted by a court and remained on duty.
*In the late afternoon of 18 December 1979, an S-Bahn train operating on the northern Berlin outer ring between Mühlenbeck and the Karow Cross collided with a just approaching freight train. The driver was killed in the accident, 20 passengers were injured, five of them seriously.
*In 1987, there were several derailments of BVG S-Bahn trains in the Berlin Nord-Süd Tunnel. After a train had been derailed before and behind the platform Friedrichstraße with the first bogie, there was a major incident in March 1987, when a northbound train derailed in the narrow left turn of the Spree underpass. The BVG railcar 275 227 slid along the tunnel wall for about 50 meters, severely damaging the cable and the car itself. There was no personal injury.
*On October 20, 1987, another train derailed with the penultimate bogie of the train in the tight right turn in front of the Berlin Brandenburger Tor station (then known as &quot;Unter den Linden&quot;). The last derailed car (275 319) fell out of profile and crashed into the platform, breaking a three-meter-long piece out of the edge and tearing a signal off the wall. On 2 November 1987, exactly at the same place, there was again a derailment of the last car (275 435). This also got out of profile and rammed again the platform edge. Both accidents caused considerable damage, but no personal injury. As a cause for the total of six derailments was found:
**While the BVG began to profile its wheel profiles according to the current UIC standard, the track layouts of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in the north-south S-Bahn tunnel did not meet the current requirements, which apparently led to compatibility problems (rail inclination DR 1:20, UIC 1:40).
**After the transfer of the West Berlin S-Bahn to the BVG, the DR had completely removed the previously existing guard rails from the tight curves.
**The Deutsche Reichsbahn had dismantled all curve lubrication devices on the track arches, which had greatly increased the tendency to climb the wheel arches. In connection with the other two points it had to come to the derailments. As a consequence, the DR rebuilt the lubricators and imposed a speed reduction from . The BVG marked all the quarter-trains that already carried the new UIC profile with a yellow line under the company number. These cars were excluded from driving through the tunnel.
*On October 21, 2001, at Ostkreuz and on May 13, 2002, at Hackescher Markt, rear-end collisions occurred which gave rise to the introduction of speed monitoring. At Ostkreuz, two trains of the class 485 collided late on Sunday evening, when the approaching train could not be stopped in time for emergency braking. The driver claimed to have initiated the required speed reduction before the stop signal, however, no evidence could be found to confirm this claim. Instead, the court presumed the driver was inattentive shortly before the end of the shift, and ignored the previous signal. Twelve people were injured and there were 190,000 euros in property damage. Also at Hackescher Markt station, experts were unable to identify any problems with the brake system of the 481 model series involved, which could explain the excessive speed at the entrance to the occupied track of the platform. Here 13 people were injured, again mainly by broken discs. In both cases, a fine was imposed on train drivers who both no longer drive trains.
*On August 10, 2004, a class 480 suburban railway car caught fire in the underground Anhalter station. The cause was a cabling fault in the brake resistor fan. The station suffered severe damage, had to be closed and rehabilitated for several months, but there were no casualties. The costs for the renovation were given as a total of 5.5 million euros. As a result of this accident, it was decided to outfit all underground stations with at least two exits, analogous to the Berlin subway. In practice, this concerns only the stations Oranienburger Straße and Anhalter Bahnhof, the latter received another southern exit in the direction of Tempodrom.
*On November 20, 2006, at 10:25 am, a S-Bahn train on the S25 line in the direction of Hennigsdorf in Südkreuz station hit an occupied track and collided with a work train. The impact threw passengers through the car, injuring 33 of the approximately 100 passengers, two of them seriously injured. The work train, a track gauge, had traveled the track before and covered the rails with a film of water. As a result of this film, the following class 481 S-Bahn train slid out of the area during braking in the station area and landed on the work train. As a consequence of this accident was ordered that the vehicles of the Berlin S-Bahn enter stations more slowly. As a result of the accident, the maximum speed allowed on all 481 Series trains in February 2008 was reduced to . Only after the modification of the anti-slip system are higher speeds to be driven again.
*On May 1, 2009, an S-Bahn train of the class 481 in Kaulsdorf derailed due to a broken wheel. According to S-Bahners, the scheduled main investigation of the derailed train had been postponed for two years. As a consequence, this accident led to the subsequent chaos in 2009, since the test intervals were shortened and therefore at times only 165 out of 552 required quarter trains were available. Eventually, all axes had to be replaced because they were generally considered to be inadequate.
*On August 21, 2012, derailed when crossing a turnout in the northern exit of the station Tegel a moving towards Hennigsdorf S-Bahn line S25. In the accident five passengers were injured, the driver suffered a shock and also had to be cared for medically.

<text>Katherine is a town in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is situated on the Katherine River, after which it is named, southeast of Darwin. The fourth largest settlement in the Territory, it is known as the place where &quot;The outback meets the tropics&quot;. 
Katherine had an urban population of 5,980 at the 2021 Australia Census.

Katherine is also the closest major town to RAAF Base Tindal, located southeast, and provides education, health, local government services and employment opportunities for the families of Defence personnel stationed there. In the , the base had a residential population of 857, with only around 20% of the workforce engaged in employment outside of defence, the majority commuting to work in Katherine. Katherine is also the central hub of the great &quot;Savannah Way&quot; which stretches from Cairns in north Queensland to Broome in the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

Beginning as an outpost established with the Australian Overland Telegraph Line on the north–south transport route between Darwin and Adelaide, Katherine has grown with the development of transport and local industries including mining – particularly gold mining; a strategic military function with RAAF Base Tindal; also as a tourism gateway to the attractions of nearby Nitmiluk National Park, particularly Nitmiluk (Katherine) Gorge and its many ancient rock paintings. The region floods heavily during the wet season.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of the area were Indigenous Australians, specifically the Dagoman people.
It was an important meeting place for these tribes and remains a place of convergence.
Today the Walpiri people from the Victoria River District and Tanami Desert areas now have a dedicated community based at Katherine East. 

Explorer John McDouall Stuart passed through the area in 1862 on his successful third journey across the continent from north to south. On 4 July 1862, Stuart crossed the Katherine River 90 km upstream from the present town, and recorded in his diary: &quot;Came upon another large creek, having a running stream to the south of west and coming from the north of east. This I have named &#x27;Katherine&#x27;, in honour of the second daughter of pastoralist James Chambers &quot; There is some conjecture over Stuart&#x27;s accuracy. Chambers&#x27;s wife&#x27;s name was Katherine but, according to most sources, his daughter&#x27;s name was Catherine.
Katherine Telegraph Station was established on 22 August 1872 and the completion of the Overland Telegraph Line later in 1872, and the town began with a small permanent population on the west side of the Katherine River. Katherine benefited from the proximity to nearby gold fields including Pine Creek 90 kilometres to the north. 

Gold was discovered 50 kilometres to the north in 1889 at Mount Todd.

The North Australia Railway was extended to Katherine with construction beginning in 1923 of the Katherine railway bridge. During construction of the railway, the town&#x27;s centre was relocated to the eastern side of the river. The bridge was completed in 1926 and the first train crossed on 21 January 1926. On 15 July 1926, the town&#x27;s present site was gazetted. The original post office and the Overland Telegraph station were set just above Knott&#x27;s Crossing and next to the Sportsman&#x27;s Arms Hotel that had quarters for the station master at the Overland Telegraph station and a single room police station.

A highly influential period in Katherine&#x27;s past was the arrival of a number of Russian migrants between 1929 and 1960. These migrants came to the area after the NT administration offered tracts of land for peanut farming along the Katherine River. Earlier, in 1880, the government botanist Maurice Holtze had investigated the commercial viability of peanuts as a crop and found them viable. This encouraged many men, including those who had just completed work on the North Australia Railway, to take up the land. Many men who took up this land were also Cossacks who had fought against the newly formed Communist government in the Russian Civil War; many had served under Alexander Kolchak. The majority of the group had reached Australia between 1925 and 1928, and in 1929 they were able to commence clearing their land. The industry had mostly collapsed by the beginning of World War II because of erratic rainfall and a problematic supply chain. Some of these migrants were Jim Zimin, Ivan Ivanetz and Nadia Pascoe.

During World War II, the Australian Army set up two hospitals around Katherine, the 101st Australian General Hospital and 121st Australian General Hospital. The army also set up a Katherine Area Headquarters. On 22 March 1942, Katherine sustained its only air raid during World War II. One man was killed when a Japanese aircraft bombed the town.

Mining production has declined since the closure of the mine at Mount Todd (50 kilometres to the north) in 2000. 

Construction began on a new rail line in July 2001. On 13 September 2003, the line was finished with a continuous track from Adelaide, South Australia, to Darwin. &quot;The Ghan&quot; passenger train service commenced on 4 February 2004, running several times a week and stopping on both the northbound and southbound journeys. 

The river flooded the town in 1931, 1940, 1957, 1998 and 2006. The 1998 floods were the worst on record. The river reached a height of 20.4 metres.

The April 2006 floods placed parts of the town under water (including about 50 houses), caused millions of dollars of damage, and resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency on 7 April. However, there were no reports of the flooding causing structural damage. Town residents were given warning that the river might flood on 5 April, and the town centre was underwater before noon the next day. The floodwaters reached a peak of nearly 19 metres at the Katherine River bridge. Dozens of homes were inundated with up to 2 m of water, with many residents having time to escape with little more than the clothes they were wearing. Over the weekend of 8–9 April, more than 1,100 people went to the evacuation centres in the town. The state of emergency was lifted on 9 April.

In recent decades, Katherine has developed as a regional centre supporting the cattle, horticulture, agriculture and tourism industries. Located at the junction of major tourism drives, Central Arnhem Road, the Savannah Way and the Explorers Way, Katherine is an important visitor gateway for the Northern Territory.

On Australia Day in 1998 a major flood devastated the town, and the area was declared a national disaster. The flood resulted from the 300–400 mm of rainwater brought by Cyclone Les that caused the already full Katherine River to peak at 20.4 metres. The floodwaters inundated the town and much of the surrounding region, requiring the evacuation of many residents. The flood covered an area of 1000 square kilometres, affected 1100 homes and cut off many roads in and out of Katherine. Three people drowned.

==Population==
According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,303 people in Katherine.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 25.4% of the population. 
* 66.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 2.9%, New Zealand 1.8% and England 1.7%.
* 64.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kriol at 3.5%. 
* The most common response for religion was No Religion at 31.1%.

Katherine&#x27;s population swells immensely during the Dry Season. Each year hundreds of older people (termed &quot;Grey nomads&quot;) from the colder parts of Australia pack caravans and head north to Katherine and other locations throughout the Northern Territory. 

== Geography and climate ==

=== Topography ===

Katherine is located south of Darwin, and is situated on the banks of the Katherine River, which is part of the Daly River system. The upper reaches rise into the Arnhem Land escarpment and Kakadu, to the northeast.
The Victoria River (The Northern Territory&#x27;s largest river system) is situated south-west of Katherine along the Victoria Highway.
Katherine is at the crossroads of the Outback due to its location between the Darwin region, Kakadu National Park, the Barkley Region, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Kimberley region of Western Australia.

The topography of the region is predominantly dry tropical savanna woodlands and consists of plains, hills, rock outcrops.
To the east lies Koombolgie sandstone escarpments and spectacular gorges through Nitmiluk National Park.
The township itself is set among relatively flat plains along the Katherine River within the Tindall / Oolloo Aquifers, dotted with rugged Karst limestone formations, caves and jagged outcrops.
Numerous mesas (flat-topped hills or &quot;Jump-ups&quot;) emerge south-west of Katherine on surrounding cattle stations.

Katherine is within an ecoregion classified as the Kimberley tropical savanna which covers a large portion of Australia&#x27;s north-west through WA and the NT.

=== Climate ===

Katherine experiences a dry tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;) with distinct wet and dry seasons. Daily high temperatures in the wet season typically range from , reaching over from late September to late November. Very high humidity accompanies high temperatures during the build-up period to the wet season, when the region receives spectacular electrical storms. The wet season monsoon period is a dramatic time of year, from large thunderstorms and heavy downpours to the transitions of lush greenery appearing from the parched deciduous landscapes of the dry season. Katherine experiences around 50 thunderstorm days per year, most of which occur from November to April.

In the dry, the nights can get quite cool, regularly dropping to around June and July. Humidity levels are much lower from June to August and hence this has become the most popular time for visitors who wish to explore the region. Most parks and roads are accessible during the dry season, whereas the wet season often causes accessibility restrictions.

Low elevation relative to surrounding areas, as well as the town&#x27;s situation on the banks of a river, means that the area is prone to flooding. A flood on Australia Day in 1998 was particularly destructive. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Les produced between of rainfall during a 48-hour period, causing the Katherine River to rise to 21.3 metres and claim the lives of three people.

=== Districts ===
The central business district of Katherine is set 350 metres from the banks of the Katherine River. The township services the regional centres of Pine Creek, Mataranka, Borooloola, Daly River and Timber Creek.

The RAAF Tindal Base is located 17 km from Katherine and plays a significant role in the local economy. Tindal Airbase officially opened on 1 October 1988.

The Katherine Town Council (municipality) Zone extends from Flora River Junction in the West to Maranboy in the East and from the Fergusson River in the North to the Sturt Plateau in the South.
Other shire zones in the Katherine Region are the Victoria Daly and the Roper Gulf shires.

Traditional lands of the area include the Wardaman, Jawoyn and Dagoman aboriginal land trusts.
The township itself is a convergence zone of these traditional lands.

Wardaman country occupies areas to the west of Katherine, from Manbulloo (around Limestone Creek) to eastern parts of the Victoria River District.

Jawoyn country occupies areas to the east of Katherine from Lansdowne to the southern edge of Kakadu National Park, including Nitmiluk National Park, Barunga, Beswick and south-western Arnhem Land.

Dagoman country occupies areas to the south of Katherine, from Leach Lagoon, the Upper King River, the Dry River and across to the Warlock Ponds near Mataranka.

=== Built environment ===
Springvale Homestead, built in 1879, is the oldest original homestead in the Northern Territory. The homestead was originally managed by Alfred Giles, an ex-Overland Telegraph linesman. The Old Katherine Railway Station is another historic attraction that served Vestey&#x27;s Meatworks during their operation in Darwin and was a major hub of transport during World War II.

Another historic site is the O’Keeffe Residence. Originally built as a recreation hut in 1943 for army officers during World War II, the structure serves as a good example of local construction practice, using local materials like Cypress pine and corrugated iron.

The Gallon Licence Store is another historical gem of the Old Katherine Settlement, built by Bernard Murphy in 1891. Located near Knotts Crossing, it is surrounded by large Boab Trees and Bauhinia near the banks of the Katherine River.
The Gallon Licence Store was also featured in the crocodile horror film &quot;Rogue&quot;.

Since the establishment of Nitmiluk National Park, Katherine has developed into a tourism destination. Katherine Gorge in Nitmiluk National Park attracts large numbers of visitors each year (232,000 in 2004–05).

== Parks and gardens ==
Katherine town and surrounds provide plenty of park and garden areas. Dakota Park, Giles Park, Styles Park Jurassic Cycad Gardens, Jukes Park and O’Shea Park are in the town. Tourist attractions include Nitmiluk National Park and Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park, Kintore Caves Nature Park with its populations of endangered cycads, Low Level Nature Park, Springvale Homestead and Katherine Hot Springs.
Other significant parks of the region include Elsey National Park, Gregory National Park and Giwining/Flora River Nature Park.

Along Riverbank Drive on the Katherine River, Katherine Hot Springs provides swimming, shaded picnic tables and barbecue facilities set amongst tall paperpark trees and ghost gums, with an abundant array of birds and wildlife. A paved pathway loops around and along the Katherine River and mountain bike trails weave on and off a paved pathway down to the river. A popup cafe and bike hire are situated at the Hot Springs Carpark in the dry season (May to October).
Fishing for barramundi, tarpon (ox-eye herring) and sooty grunter, locally known as &quot;Black Bream&quot;, are also popular along the Katherine River. The river hosts a diverse variety of fish species.
The low level nature reserve and hot springs and Nitmiluk National Park are regularly checked for crocodiles and are regarded reasonably safe for swimming during the dry season months.

Popular fishing spots:

Donkey Camp, the Old King River Crossing, Knott&#x27;s Crossing and Edith River are good fishing spots. The Flora River 90 minutes southwest of town also offers excellent barramundi fishing either by casting from the bank or by small boat. The Flora is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles year-round and swimming is not permitted.

Both freshwater crocodiles (&quot;Crocodylus johnstoni&quot;) and saltwater crocodiles (&quot;Crocodylus porosus&quot;) inhabit river systems in the Katherine Region.

== Government ==
The seat of local government for the Town of Katherine is located in Katherine. The council consists of five aldermen, a mayor, and a deputy mayor. The town&#x27;s current mayor is Elisabeth Clark.

At Territory level, the electoral division of Katherine covers the town and its suburbs and elects one member to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Jo Hersey won the election in 2020 for the CLP, ousting Labor party member Sandra Nelson. Many Northern Territory Government departments have offices in Katherine with most of these housed in the Government Centre building in First Street, which allows the community to access services such as motor vehicle registration and public health clinics, family and community services and public housing. There is also a courthouse located next door which regularly hears matters before the Northern Territory Magistrates Court within the chambers.

In the Australian House of Representatives, Katherine is part of the Division of Lingiari, which includes all of the Territory outside the Darwin/Palmerston area. Lingiari is currently held by Marion Scrymgour. The Australian Senate has two senators from the Northern Territory – Jacinta Price representing the Country Liberal Party and Malarndirri McCarthy from the Australian Labor Party. Katherine has been a solid base for the centre-right Country Liberal Party. 

Federal Government services including Centrelink are also accessible through offices in Katherine.

== Economy ==
The pastoral industry, mining, defence (RAAF Base Tindal) and tourism contribute to the economy of Katherine. In 2003–04, the estimated total value of agriculture production from the Katherine Region was $75M: $52M from cattle, $16.5M from fruit and vegetables and $7M from hay and other field crops. Production from mining in the region was estimated at $201M in 2003–04, or 13% of NT mining and energy production. Major commodities included lead, zinc, barites, limestone and gravel.

In support of the pastoral and agriculture industries, the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries maintains the Katherine Research Station, employing up to 40 staff in laboratories, greenhouses, coolrooms and animal-handling facilities, with open lands for cropping and grazing activities. The facility comprises of land on a site located off the Stuart Highway east of Katherine. The research conducted at the station assists local farmers to align land-management to climate and environment, and to address pests and diseases.

Mangoes, including the Kensington Pride, are a major primary industry in the territory. In summer, the Katherine region is one of Australia&#x27;s major mango-producing areas. The Northern Territory in general produces early-season (September–November) mangoes, avoiding the potentially damaging wet season.

Cotton is an emerging industry in and around Katherine. Trials of modern, generically-modified cotton such as Bollgard3 have been undertaken at the Katherine Research Station. By 2019-20, 800 hectares of cotton was sown in the Territory across six properties in the Katherine and Top End regions, many of which are managed by operators from the Murray Darling regions of New South Wales. While 80% of crops were rain-fed, there are still environmental concerns over industry water usage, with projections that even small-scale irrigation for cotton could still amount to water usage equivalent to almost 70% of current allocations. A $70 million cotton gin was established by WANT north of Katherine in December 2023. 

The town&#x27;s principal retail facility, the Katherine Shopping Centre of is owned by Vicinity Centres and includes a Woolworths supermarket, a K Hub store (replaced Target Country in early 2021) and speciality stores.

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===

Katherine was originally connected to Darwin via the North Australia Railway, a narrow-gauge railway which reached the town in 1926. The line fell into disuse and was closed in May 1976, after damage caused by Cyclone Tracy led to the cessation of the shipment of iron ore from the Frances Creek mine. In 2003, the line was replaced by the standard gauge line from Alice Springs to Darwin.

The Ghan, run by Journey Beyond, operates on the standard gauge line between Adelaide and Darwin. It runs once a week in each direction, with some exceptions.

A new Katherine Logistics and Agribusiness Hub is being planned. The proposed new passenger terminal and associated access road, carpark and rail platform will be constructed on a new rail line loop.


=== Air ===
Katherine Airport, situated within RAAF Base Tindal, is approximately 15 km south of the town centre. Airnorth flies to Katherine three times a week from Darwin and Alice Springs. Charter flights can also be arranged.
The current airport shares facilities with RAAF Base Tindal, replacing the original Katherine Airfield which operated from 1930 to 1978, which was notable as the base from which Dr Clyde Fenton established the Northern Territory Aerial Medical Service.

The airport and town received an extended description in the book &quot;Beyond the Blue Horizon&quot; by Alexander Frater, written in the 1980s and describing a journey by local air services from London to Brisbane, retracing the route of the pioneer airline operations of the 1930s.

=== Road ===
Katherine is at the crossroads of the Savannah Way that runs east–west from Cairns to Broome and the Explorer&#x27;s Way that runs north–south from Darwin to Adelaide through Alice Springs. Savannah Way runs along the Victoria Highway at Katherine and Explorers Way runs along Stuart Highway. The town is a three-hour drive from Darwin.

<doc id="525778" wikidata="Q130149" url="?curid=525778" title="Yermak (1898 icebreaker)">
<text>Yermak () was a Russian and later Soviet icebreaker. It was the first polar icebreaker in the world, having a strengthened hull shaped to ride over and crush pack ice.

==History==
An earlier vessel, the schooner Yermak, was commissioned for the 1862 attempt to find the Yenissei river delta by Paul Theodor von Krusenstern, by navigating from Murmansk through the Kara Sea to the destination, but unfortunately was shipwrecked before obtaining success.

&quot;Yermak&quot; was built for the Imperial Russian Navy under the supervision of vice-admiral S. O. Makarov by the members of his commission, which included D. I. Mendeleev, engineers N. I. Yankovsky and R. I. Runeberg, admiral F. F. Wrangel, among others. It was built in Newcastle upon Tyne at its Low Walker yard and launched in 1898. She was named after the famous Russian explorer of Siberia, Don Cossack ataman Yermak Timofeyevich.

She was commissioned on 17 October 1898. She arrived in Kronstadt on 4 March 1899 after breaking through ice and a formal reception was held to mark her arrival. Later in 1899 she reached 81°21&#x27;N north of Spitsbergen. She had been constructed to break through heavy ice (up to 2 m in thickness).

&quot;Yermak&quot; had been used in the winter of 1899–1900 to set up the first radio communication link in Russia between Kotka and Gogland (Suursaar) island (distance 47 km). In 1900 she came to the aid of the cruiser &quot;Gromoboi&quot; which had grounded in the Baltic.

Between 1899 and 1911 &quot;Yermak&quot; sailed in heavy ice conditions for more than 1000 days.&quot;Yermak&quot; was initially part of the fleet sailing to the Battle of Tsushima but irresponsible manoeuvring resulted in shots being fired across her bow before she was dismissed from the fleet in early October 1904 O.S.

During World War I she assisted the Baltic Fleet during the Ice Cruise when the fleet was evacuated from Helsinki to Kronstadt in February 1918.

During World War II the &quot;Yermak&quot; was mobilised again and took part in the evacuation of Hanko naval base. She was armed with two 102 mm, two 76 mm, four 45 mm and four machine guns.

&quot;Yermak&quot; served with different branches of the Russian and Soviet Navy and Merchant Marine up until 1964, becoming one of the longest-serving icebreakers in the world. An island in the Nordenskiöld Archipelago was named after her.

A monument to the icebreaker &quot;Yermak&quot; was unveiled in Murmansk In November 1965 – this included mosaic panels and the original anchor on the pedestal.

Another icebreaker with the name &quot;Yermak&quot; was built for the Soviet Union at the Wärtsilä Helsinki shipyard, Finland in 1974.
Russia employs an icebreaker named &quot;Yermak&quot; in the Baltic Sea as late as 2010.

<doc id="525794" wikidata="Q198954" url="?curid=525794" title="Jewish Legion">
<text>The Jewish Legion was a series of battalions of Jewish soldiers who served in the British Army during World War I. Some participated in the British conquest of Palestine from the Ottomans. 

The formation of the battalions had several motives: the expulsion of the Ottomans, gaining military experience, and the hope that their contribution would favorably influence the support for a Jewish national home in the land when a new world order was established after the war. The idea for the battalions was proposed by Pinhas Rutenberg, Dov Ber Borochov, and Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, and carried out by Jabotinsky and Joseph Trumpeldor, who aspired for the battalions to become the independent military force of the Yishuv in Palestine. 

Their vision did not fully materialize, as the battalions were disbanded shortly after the war. However, their activities significantly contributed to the establishment of defense organizations like the Haganah and the Irgun (which later became the foundation for the Israel Defense Forces).

== Formation and objectives ==
During World War I, a debate emerged within the Zionist leadership: whether to support one of the sides—the Entente Powers versus the Central Powers—or to maintain neutrality, and which policy would best ensure the survival of the Jewish community in Palestine during the war and benefit its aspirations for a national home afterward. This debate created a rift between those who supported the Entente Powers and those who supported the Central Powers. At that time, Jews of German origin were patriotic to their country of origin, while the battalions were a British initiative against the Ottomans, allies of the Germans. Therefore, the &quot;German&quot; Jews opposed the battalions vehemently, and Chaim Weizmann yielded to them, opposing the battalions mainly because the one protecting the Yishuv in Palestine was a German general. There was also a real fear that the Ottomans would carry out a massacre of the Jews if they decided that the Jews were a fifth column, as they had done to the Armenians.

Pinhas Rutenberg was a member of the Socialist Revolutionary (SR) party, which, unlike the Bolsheviks, supported an alliance with Britain. David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Ben-Zvi were pro-Ottoman and opposed the battalions. What changed their minds completely was the Balfour Declaration, after which they enlisted in the battalion.

== World War I and the establishment of the battalions ==

During the period leading up to the outbreak of the war in 1914, revolutionaries were waiting for a revolution in Russia. The Okhrana was successful in its activities against the revolutionaries, and SR activists went into exile from Russia. Lenin and his colleagues also established the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, competing with the SR in exile. When the war broke out, a meeting was held among the SR exiles&#x27; leadership, which was divided between left and right. Supporters of Ilya Fondaminsky argued that the war would shake the tsarist regime and therefore should enlist and aid the British to bring the revolution closer. There was also an opposing trend led by Viktor Chernov, a rival to Rutenberg, who opposed this approach.

Rutenberg went to London, met with Weizmann, and tried to convince him to support the establishment of the Jewish battalions. Rutenberg told Weizmann that the war was an opportunity to advance the idea of a republic in Israel. To convince the Entente Powers, Jewish legions composed of Jewish exiles needed to be established. According to Prof. Matityahu Mintz, Rutenberg preceded Jabotinsky. Rutenberg acted in September 1914, while Jabotinsky began in 1915.

The question arises as to what motivated Rutenberg, who was traveling on behalf of the SR to the capitals of Britain and France to pressure Russia for greater democratization, to engage with the Jewish people and meet Weizmann. Mintz clarified that for Rutenberg, these were not separate domains. Before his trip, Rutenberg had not spoken about or sought a solution to the Jewish question, but this was a result of Rutenberg&#x27;s discussions with the SR leadership, who sent him to France. Mintz does not believe that Rutenberg&#x27;s return to the Jewish people was insincere but emphasizes the alignment between his conduct and the interests of the party and Russia. The evidence for maintaining ties and prioritizing the party&#x27;s interests was Rutenberg&#x27;s rapid and smooth integration into the government leadership after the February Revolution of 1917 during Alexander Kerensky&#x27;s social-revolutionary administration.

The SR, as well as the Cadets, thought that the number of Jews in Russia was too large, and it would be better if they left Russia before the revolution, as it would be beneficial for the Jews as well. The SR was aware of the Jews&#x27; animosity toward the autocratic regime in Russia, alongside the growing Jewish sympathy for Germany, which had granted them freedom and rights. Rutenberg adopted this SR stance. The idea of battalions that would conquer the land from the Ottomans, allies of the Germans, served the interests of the Russian homeland, allied with France and Britain.

Mintz noted that even when the Zionist movement decided on neutrality, in practice, this was not the case, as Zionists in each country supported their homeland. For instance, German Zionists believed that if Germany won the war, the Jews&#x27; situation would improve, as their status in Russia was worse compared to Germany.
Rutenberg then went to Italy and established an organization for the Jewish cause. The basic idea was that if Italy joined the war on the side of the Entente Powers, the first Jewish battalions would be formed in Italy. Dov Ber Borochov also arrived in Italy from Vienna after the Austrian police made it clear that it would be better for him to leave the Austro-Hungarian Empire, an ally of Germany. In Milan, Rutenberg and Borochov met after David Goldstein, a member of Poale Zion, connected them. Borochov joined Rutenberg and was active in leading this organization. He managed to organize not only Jews but also intellectuals, politicians, and Italian ministers, like Luigi Luzzatti. In 1915, they joined, but Rutenberg decided to go to the United States. Before that, he traveled to Bari in Italy and invited Jabotinsky, Ben-Gurion, and Ben-Zvi to present the plan. Ben-Gurion and Ben-Zvi refused to come, and only Jabotinsky met with Rutenberg before Jabotinsky&#x27;s trip to London. Rutenberg and Jabotinsky divided the work. Rutenberg would work in the United States, and Jabotinsky in Britain, as Rutenberg aimed to establish a non-Zionist Jewish Congress in the U.S.

According to Mintz, Rutenberg brought a booklet, manifesto, to the U.S., began participating in conferences, organized a committee, and started a newspaper for the Jewish Congress. Borochov was the editor of the newspaper and also wrote the articles. A conflict broke out between Rutenberg and Ben-Gurion, who was also in the U.S., as Ben-Gurion continued to support the Ottoman orientation. Ben-Zvi joined Ben-Gurion, although Mintz notes that their relationship soured in the U.S. because Ben-Gurion published a book in which he attributed all the work to himself. According to Mintz, there is no doubt that Ben-Gurion downplayed Ben-Zvi&#x27;s contributions. There was no conflict between Ben-Zvi and Borochov, as Ben-Zvi was from Borochov&#x27;s hometown, his student, and a close friend, and they respected each other.

== Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky ==
One of the most prominent figures supporting the activist line was Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, who, knowing the Ottoman Empire, predicted its days were numbered during the war and that this would impact the future governance of Palestine. He argued that the Jews should openly support Britain and help its military efforts to capture the land of Israel.

In 1915, Jabotinsky arrived at Camp Jabari, near Alexandria, where 1,200 Jews expelled from Palestine by the Ottomans or who fled due to the harsh living conditions gradually gathered, along with Yosef Trumpeldor. Jabotinsky presented his ideas for establishing a Jewish military unit. On the 18th of Adar, 5675, a document was drafted stating the decision to establish a Jewish battalion offering its services to the British army for the conquest of Palestine. The document bore 100 signatures, with the first being those of Ze&#x27;ev Gluskin, Jabotinsky, and Trumpeldor. Subsequently, they began negotiations with various elements within the British army and government.

=== Opposition to the establishment of the battalions ===
After numerous negotiations, Britain partially agreed to the initiative, and a Jewish unit was formed with volunteers from the exiles in Egypt. The unit’s purpose was set as a transport unit on the Gallipoli front in Turkey. The means of transport of that time gave the unit its name: the &quot;Zion Mule Corps.&quot; However, its activities were not connected to Palestine, as Britain did not yet plan to attack there.

Several bodies and groups opposed the establishment of the battalions, and some actively tried to stop their formation:
* Anti-Zionist or non-Zionist Jews, particularly assimilated British Jews who feared that emphasizing Jewish nationality through the battalions would harm their status among the British.
* The leadership of the Zionist Organization, including figures like Nahum Sokolow and others in London, who aimed to maintain neutrality.
* Ahad Ha&#x27;am and others who saw the main role of Zionism in spiritual activity.
* Part of the labor camp in Palestine, especially members of Hapoel Hatzair, believed that the land should be acquired through labor, not war, and therefore opposed the establishment of the battalions and joining them.

== The Zion Mule Corps ==
The Zion Mule Corps preceded the combat Jewish battalions formed later. Its recruits were Jews exiled to Egypt by the Ottoman Empire. It was established in the spring of 1915 and was responsible for transporting supplies to the front lines during the Battle of Gallipoli in Turkey. The unit was praised for its performance. After the failed campaign, and as the British refused to transfer it to another front, the corps was disbanded, and some of its members joined the subsequent Jewish battalions.

== The Jewish Legion ==
Unlike Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky was not satisfied with the formation of the Zion Mule Corps, which was not a combat unit and did not participate in the fight against the Ottomans. He traveled to Europe to continue advocating for the battalions. Jabotinsky contacted numerous statesmen but failed to gain genuine support for his initiative in Britain, France, and Russia. The resistance stemmed from both a lack of trust in a military unit composed entirely of Jewish volunteers and a lack of intent to fight the Ottomans in Palestine at that time. Significant support also did not come from most Jewish leaders or communities. However, a few Zionist figures tried to assist Jabotinsky. The most notable was Meir Grossman, with whom he founded the newspaper &quot;Di Tribune&quot;—later known as &quot;Unser Tribune&quot;—to promote propaganda for the battalions. Pinhas Rutenberg and Chaim Weizmann also supported Jabotinsky&#x27;s initiative, but the Zionist Organization strongly opposed it, and its executive committee issued an order to all Zionists in Europe to fight against the propaganda supporting the Jewish Legion.

Jabotinsky eventually reached London, focusing his efforts there for the next two years. He decided to concentrate on around 30,000 Jews, mostly young men who were refugees from Russia, Poland, and Galicia, residing as refugees in London, particularly in the East End and Whitechapel. The efforts to form the battalion were highly determined and carried out against the odds: Horatio Kitchener, the British Secretary of War, believed that Britain did not need &quot;exotic armies&quot; and that the war would not reach Palestine. Most of the Zionist movement leaders, as mentioned earlier, tried to thwart the initiative, and above all, there was great apathy among young London Jews, most of whom saw no need to enlist in the British army, did not identify with its war, and did not identify with Zionism or the idea of conquering Palestine.

Nevertheless, voices in Britain began to grow in favor of compulsory enlistment. The people of the kingdom witnessed the heavy losses among the youth on the battlefields compared to the &quot;café dwellers,&quot; many of whom were European refugees in London, including young Jews. The British Home Office later ordered compulsory enlistment for British citizens. The foreign Jews initially refused enlistment. Jabotinsky and his supporters clarified to both the British authorities and the young Jews that joining a Jewish battalion was the only way out of the predicament. Two catalysts then appeared: an editorial supporting the idea in the influential newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; and a group of 120 former members of the Zion Mule Corps, along with Trumpeldor, who joined the 20th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers and formed a Jewish company within it. After a decisive meeting between Trumpeldor, Jabotinsky, and senior officials at the War Office, the formation of a combat Jewish battalion was realized.

Initially, the battalion was called &quot;The Jewish Regiment&quot; (a regiment usually consisting of two battalions), and its symbol was a menorah with the slogan &quot;Kadima,&quot; meaning &quot;forward&quot; in both &quot;advance&quot; and &quot;eastward.&quot; They recommended John Henry Patterson as its commander, as he had led the Zion Mule Corps throughout its operations in Gallipoli. Trumpeldor, who had served as the deputy commander of the Mule Corps in Gallipoli and succeeded Patterson in its final months, was initially denied an officer&#x27;s commission by the British, so he returned to Russia to promote his idea of forming a massive Jewish army to fight on the Caucasus front and advance toward Palestine. The Jewish company of the 20th Battalion joined the new Jewish battalion, and its members became the core of the unit.

=== The 38th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers ===

The 38th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)—commonly referred to as the &quot;London Battalion&quot;—was mainly composed of Jews from London, England, with a smaller number of Americans. This battalion, led by Patterson due to his success with the Zion Mule Corps, had two-thirds of its officers as Jews, whereas other battalions had a majority of Christian officers. Recruitment for this battalion took place in England.

In August 1917, two official notices were issued: one obligating Russian citizens residing in England to enlist in the army, and the other announcing the establishment of the Jewish battalion. Despite obstacles, the assimilated Jews in London continued to oppose its existence and tried to dissolve it. Although they failed in their efforts, their influence led to the cancellation of the name &quot;The Jewish Regiment&quot; and the menorah symbol. Instead, it was given the name of a regular British battalion—the 38th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers. The War Minister promised, however, that the battalion would regain its symbols after proving itself in combat. The public and the press still referred to it by its original name, the recruitment office displayed Hebrew signs, and the soldiers and officers wore Star of David insignias on their left arm (the 38th Battalion had a light purple Star of David, the 39th was red, and the 40th was blue). The soldiers trained at a camp near Portsmouth.

On 2 February 1918, the Jewish battalion marched through the main streets of London and Whitechapel. Great excitement was felt among the city&#x27;s Jews, many shops hung blue and white flags, and the proud soldiers of the legion were received with loud cheers in the streets. The next day, the battalion set off for France, then through Italy to Egypt.

The 38th Battalion trained in Egypt and was later sent to Palestine. There were already many volunteers from among the local youth who would later form the 40th Battalion. In early June, the battalion was stationed on the front lines of the British forces in the hills of Ephraim, an area where the British forces were engaged in skirmishes against the Ottomans. Malaria was an issue, which afflicted many. 

In mid-August, the battalion was sent to the Jordan front, where it served as a link throughout the British front. In September, at the beginning of the Battle of Megiddo, Patterson received orders to capture the Umm al-Shert Bridge in the Jordan Valley, the only bridge in the area (located directly east of the moshav Netiv HaGdud, named after this operation). The first company sent to the location came under fire, its captain Julian was barely rescued, the lieutenant was wounded and taken prisoner, and a private was killed. Jabotinsky then led the second company to seize the site, and the mission was successfully completed on the 22nd of the month.
From there, the battalion advanced to the area of As-Salt, east of the Jordan River, where the 39th Battalion had already preceded them, and it established a garrison there. In Gilead, the British completed their conquest of Palestine, and the battalion returned to its western side, taking Ottoman and German prisoners. Subsequently, the battalion was tasked with guarding military facilities.

=== The 39th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers ===

The 39th Battalion was known as &quot;the American Battalion,&quot; with most of its soldiers coming from the Jewish community in the United States, and a minority from England. The origins of its formation lie in Pinhas Rutenberg’s 1915 initiative to create a military unit composed of American and Canadian Jews. Initially, American Jews did not agree to his initiative, but when the United States entered World War I in April 1917, their stance changed. This battalion was recruited in the United States.

The principal initiators of its establishment were Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and David Ben-Gurion, who were exiled from Palestine during the war by Djemal Pasha. They changed their position after the Balfour Declaration. About 5,000 volunteers (though not all managed to arrive in Palestine) formed the battalion, which operated under British command. The battalion’s commander was Colonel Eliezer Margolin. It included a core group of members from the &quot;HaHalutz&quot; (The Pioneer) movement and &quot;Poalei Zion,&quot; meaning, unlike the 38th British Battalion, most of its members were Zionists. In 1918, the battalion’s soldiers were sent to Palestine, where the 38th Battalion had also arrived.

About half of its members participated in the military campaigns in the Jordan Valley and Samaria during the time the 38th Battalion was also present there. After the capture of the Umm-Shert Bridge, half of the battalion moved to the area of Jericho and then to Gilead to complete the British conquest of Palestine. Some members of the battalion only arrived in the land after the war ended.

=== The 40th Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers ===

The 40th Battalion was known as &quot;the Palestinian Battalion&quot; of the Jewish Legion. The primary mission of this battalion was to perform guard and security duties. It was formed after the British forces entered Palestine, and many local youths wanted to participate in the Jewish military effort. Even before the 38th Battalion arrived, there were already 1,500 youths prepared to volunteer, one-third of whom were women, though the women were not enlisted. The desire of the local Palestinian Jewish youth to enlist met the initiative of Major General John Hill, commander of the 52nd Division, who called on the young men of the Yishuv in areas already conquered by the British to join the army and assist in further conquests of the land. Most of the volunteers were young &quot;activists&quot; from the labor camp, members of the Jaffa Group and the Small Assembly, as well as high school students from Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium, who campaigned vigorously for recruitment. Their initiative met resistance, and a debate arose within the Jewish Yishuv regarding enlistment.

The decision was made at the First Constituent Assembly on 2 January 1918, following a discussion in which the leadership of &quot;Poalei Zion&quot; supported enlistment and volunteering. Moshe Smilansky and Eliyahu Golomb argued that joining the Jewish Battalions was a political endeavor that elevated the status of the Yishuv in the eyes of its new rulers and contributed to the strength of the community.

Members of the &quot;HaPoel HaTzair&quot; party, including Yosef Sprinzak and A.D. Gordon, were the main opponents, arguing that the Yishuv’s efforts should focus on settlement and agriculture, alongside a pacifist ideology that opposed participation in imperialist and bloody wars. Another argument was the fear of harm to the settlers of the Galilee, who were still under Turkish rule. Despite the opposition from the leadership of HaPoel HaTzair, there were volunteers from this movement who joined the battalion.

In parallel with the enlistment campaign conducted in Tel Aviv, which resulted in one company of volunteers, Baron James de Rothschild led a recruitment campaign in Jerusalem, producing a second company of recruits. The volunteers from Jerusalem included some students from the teacher&#x27;s seminary and mostly members of the old Yishuv who enlisted with the blessing of the rabbis.
General Allenby was initially reluctant to the idea of a unit of Jewish soldiers under his command, but Zionist political activity in London led to its establishment, and 1,000 volunteers were accepted into its ranks. Smilansky, who also enlisted, spearheaded the recruitment campaign. This battalion was formed in Palestine. Among the enlistees were Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, David Ben-Gurion, and Berl Katznelson, who were already public leaders in the Yishuv but served as privates in the battalion. The 40th Battalion completed its initial training near Tel El-Kebir in Egypt, under the command of Colonel Margolin. After Margolin was appointed to command the 39th Battalion, Colonel Frederick Samuel, a member of an assimilated English-Jewish family who had previously served as a battalion commander on the French front, took command. He expected a promotion to brigadier but, upon receiving a letter stating that Jewish officers were needed for the Jewish Legion, left his unit, forgoing the brigadier position, and joined the 40th Battalion. After him, the battalion was commanded by Colonel M.P. Scott, who was Christian. The battalion did not participate in battles, and its soldiers served in support roles for the British army and guarded prisoners. In December 1918, the battalion was moved to the Sarafand (now Tzrifin) area, and some of its soldiers, those who found work, were released from service. By the end of 1919, part of the battalion was stationed at Rafah and received an order to send 80 of its soldiers to the Egyptian headquarters. As this was against the &quot;agreement,&quot; its soldiers refused to comply. Scott supported their stance and excused them from the order. After his service, Scott remained a supporter of Zionism, quoted as saying: &quot;England has been honored: We tore a page from the Bible inscribed with the oldest prophecy—adding England&#x27;s pledge to the promissory note of God. Such a signature cannot be renounced by the nation.&quot;

The composition of the three battalions by country of origin was estimated as follows: 1,700 Americans, 1,500 Palestinian Jews, 1,400 English, 300 Canadians, 50 Argentinians, and about 50 Jewish prisoners released from Ottoman captivity.

== The &quot;First Judean&quot; ==

In the first year after the conquest of Palestine (1919), the battalions comprised a significant portion of the British forces maintaining order in the land. In the Autumn Offensive of Allenby 1918, only &quot;a battalion and a half&quot; participated, but a year later, the battalions numbered 5,000 soldiers (actually, according to British War Office records, 10,000 men were accepted into the battalions, but half did not reach Palestine because the war had already ended). The presence of the battalions in Palestine moderated the Arab population&#x27;s attitude toward the Yishuv. For two months, uprisings broke out in Egypt, and the sense of Arab national awakening also reached Palestine, but it did not ignite significant actions.

After the war ended, the morale of the soldiers in the legion declined, and most of the English and American soldiers wanted to return to their home countries. The British military administration in Palestine did not align with the pro-Zionist sentiments of London and sought to disband the battalions, which they saw as potentially igniting conflict with the local Arabs.
By spring 1920, the first two battalions were already disbanded, and the remnants of their soldiers joined the Palestinian battalion, now under Margolin&#x27;s command. The War Minister’s promise was fulfilled, and the battalion was renamed the &quot;First Judean.&quot; Its symbol was the menorah, and its motto was &quot;Kadima.&quot; It was the first military body to have all its symbols in Hebrew. The Palestinian volunteers attempted to remain despite the demobilization orders strongly enforced by the military command. Many were torn between military service and labor, but some managed to extend their service by several months. Gradually, only 400 soldiers remained. Herbert Samuel planned to establish a &quot;mixed militia&quot; of Jews and Arabs, and some of the legion&#x27;s soldiers and veterans joined its Jewish section.

During the 1921 Palestine riots, on Margolin’s initiative, several dozen armed soldiers of the battalion arrived in Jaffa and Tel Aviv and participated in defending the area against Arab rioters. Among other actions, they prevented Arabs from breaking into the Jewish compound of Batay Varsha (Jaffa). Their intervention in the pogrom led to the end of their service and closed the chapter on the planned &quot;militia.&quot;

== After the Disbandment of the &quot;First Judean&quot; ==

The &quot;First Judean&quot; battalion was disbanded by the British in May 1921. The disbandment of the battalions thwarted Jabotinsky’s vision of establishing an official Jewish army and led the Yishuv to establish a clandestine armed force—the &quot;Haganah,&quot; which, as its name suggests, was primarily defensive. The disbandment of the &quot;First Judean&quot; battalion marked a British policy against an independent Jewish defense force in the Yishuv in response to Arab aggression.

== The Palestine Defense Force ==
At the time of the disbandment of the Jewish Battalions, a plan was proposed to establish a militia called the &quot;Palestine Defense Force&quot; or &quot;Defense Corps of Palestine&quot; (various translations of the English term). To establish this guard force, a number of officers and about 30 sergeants were retained in the army, intended to be the command staff of the first battalion of the future guard force.

However, after the riots in May 1921, in which the sergeants left their base without permission to assist Jewish defense forces, Colonel Margolin, the force commander, decided to resign, and the military authorities dismissed all personnel and canceled the plan to establish the guard. Some of the dismissed soldiers later became instructors and commanders in the newly formed Haganah.

== Legacy of the battalions ==
Even though the battalions’ contribution to the campaign was limited, their existence was significant as the first Jewish military force of the modern era. It was an open, non-clandestine force bearing Jewish symbols, and its language was Hebrew. The existence of the battalions provided proof of the possible strength of the Jewish people and gave moral and ethical justification for the demand to establish a Jewish national entity in Palestine. Military experience gained within the battalions, as well as the spirit of volunteerism, was later transferred to defensive frameworks like the Tel Aviv Keda Group, most of whose members were former battalion members, and later also into the underground movements operating in the land.

In his book &quot;The Legion Scroll,&quot; Jabotinsky wrote:
To the members of his battalion who were about to return to their homes overseas, he said:

The enlistment, service, and experience of military life in the battalions are described in the song &quot;Aryeh, Aryeh.&quot;

The &quot;Menorah Club&quot; was a club for veterans of the &#x27;Jewish Battalions,&#x27; established in Jerusalem in 1923. Initially located on Jaffa Street, it moved near the Bezalel Academy in 1929. Various gatherings, parties, and events were held at the club. &quot;Beit HaGdudim&quot; is a museum commemorating their work. It is located in Avihayil, a moshav founded by battalion veterans. It was also decided to move the ashes of John Patterson there.

The Jewish Legion Memorial Park exists near the beginning of the trail in the Shiloh Stream. The Jewish battalions are also commemorated at the Memorial for the Jewish Volunteers in the British Army during the World Wars.

<text>Yam O () is a bay located on the northeast shore of Lantau Island, in the New Territories of Hong Kong. It is part of the Ma Wan constituency of the Tsuen Wan District Council.

Yam O was the only natural lumber preservation zone in Hong Kong. Even today, travellers passing through Yam O can see natural lumber on stilts in the bay.

Today, Yam O is known for its interchange for the Disneyland Resort line via the nearby Sunny Bay MTR station, built on reclaimed land near Yam O.

==History==
Plans were made in the PADS (Port and Airport Development Strategy) of 1989 to reclaim the bay for ancillary port facilities. The bay was eventually reclaimed in the 2000s under the Northeast Lantau Development Strategy to accommodate a tourism gateway to Hong Kong Disneyland; this included Sunny Bay station.

==Sunny Bay==
Sunny Bay () is a recent incarnation by the Hong Kong Government, which emerged after the plans to build Hong Kong Disneyland Resort on nearby Penny&#x27;s Bay. This was done so because &quot;Yam&quot; () in Cantonese literally means &quot;dark&quot; (the same word as the Mandarin &quot;yin&quot;, well known to most English speakers from the expression &quot;yin-yang&quot;); while &quot;Yan&quot; () means &quot;happy&quot; - a significantly more favorable name to Disney. But according to &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, &quot;Yam&quot; () originally is a geographical syntax which means &quot;North of a hill or south of a body of water&quot;, so the change of the name is seen a violation of local culture and opposed by Hong Kong citizens and some Chinese language professionals.

Sunny Bay station is today also a transport interchange for Discovery Bay residents, being served by bus route &quot;DB03R&quot;.

<text>Natural childbirth is childbirth without routine medical interventions, particularly anesthesia. Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the medical model of childbirth that is common in industrialized societies. Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as episiotomies, forceps, ventouse deliveries, and caesarean sections. Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended hospital birth, a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth.

Natural childbirth is seen by some as empowering and a way to push back against paternalism and lack of patient say in the medical system. Other commentators describe it as a way to judge and shame women who need medical interventions. Home births specifically are associated with increased risks compared to hospital births, including an increased risk of death for the infant in the first 28 days of life.

==History==
Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. The &quot;natural&quot; rate of maternal mortality—meaning without surgical or pharmaceutical intervention—has been estimated at 1,500 per 100,000 births. In the United States circa 1900, before the introduction and improvement of modern medical technologies, there were about 700 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (0.7%).

At the onset of the Industrial Revolution, giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. This drove urban and lower-class women to newly available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home. In the early 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labor. The use of childbirth drugs began in 1847 when Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson introduced chloroform as an anesthetic during labor, but only the richest and most powerful women (such as Queen Victoria) had access.

The term &quot;natural childbirth&quot; was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read upon publication of his book &quot;Natural Childbirth&quot; in 1933. In the book, Dick-Read defined the term as the absence of any intervention that would otherwise disturb the sequence of labor. The book argued that because of &quot;civilized&quot; British women fear birth the birthrate was dropping, and if women were not to fear birth, birthing would be easier since fear creates tension which, in turn, causes pain. In 1942, Dick-Read published &quot;Revelation of Childbirth&quot; (which was later retitled &quot;Childbirth without Fear&quot;), advocating natural childbirth, which became an international bestseller. In the late 1940s, he brought his ideas to America, but saw similar ideas with differing names – &quot;pain-free birth&quot; and &quot;prepared childbirth&quot; – were already gaining traction. The appeal of natural childbirth rested in the idea that merging physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of reproduction would create the best comprehensive care.

The Lamaze method gained popularity in the United States after Marjorie Karmel wrote about her experiences in her 1959 book &quot;Thank You, Dr. Lamaze&quot;, and with the formation of the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics (currently Lamaze International) by Karmel and Elisabeth Bing. The Bradley method of natural childbirth (also known as &quot;husband-coached childbirth&quot;), a method of natural childbirth developed in 1947 by Robert A. Bradley, M.D., was popularized by his book &quot;Husband-Coached Childbirth&quot;, first published in 1965.

In the 1970s, natural childbirth became a movement associated with feminism and consumerism, stressing obstetrics&#x27; lack of concern for the whole person and technology a method for controlling women&#x27;s bodies. Michel Odent and midwives such as Ina May Gaskin promoted birthing centers, water birth, and homebirth as alternatives to the hospital model. Frédérick Leboyer is often mistakenly believed to have advocated for water births, but he actually rejected the alternative as he felt it was not beneficial to the health of the baby. In 1976, Gaskin wrote the book &quot;Spiritual Midwifery&quot;, which advocated for natural childbirth.

==Psychological aspects==
Many women consider natural birth empowering and giving women more control in the birth process, pushing against paternalism in the care given by medical providers.

==Alternatives to intervention==
Instead of medical interventions, a variety of non-invasive methods are employed during natural childbirth to ease the mother&#x27;s pain. Many of these techniques stress the importance of &quot;a mind-body connection,&quot; which the medical model of birth does not. These techniques include hydrotherapy, massage, relaxation therapy, hypnosis, breathing exercises, acupressure for labor, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vocalization, visualization, mindfulness and water birth. Other approaches include movement, walking, and different positions (for example, using a birthing ball), hot and cold therapy (for example, using hot compresses and/or cold packs), and receiving one-on-one labor support like that provided by a midwife or doula. However, natural childbirth proponents maintain that pain is a natural and necessary part of the labor process, and should not automatically be regarded as entirely negative. In contrast to the pain of injury and disease, they believe that the pain of childbirth is a sign that the female body is functioning as it is meant to.

Birth positions favored in natural childbirth—including squatting, hands and knees, or suspension in water—contrast with the supine lithotomy position (woman in hospital bed on her back with legs in stirrups). Supine positions, on average, when compared to upright positions, have been shown in a Cochrane review to be associated with a 6.16 minute longer duration of the second stage of labor and an increased incidence of some labor complications but a decreased incidence of other complications.

Methods to reduce tearing during natural childbirth (instead of an episiotomy) include managing the perineum with counter-pressure, hot compresses, and pushing the baby out slowly.

==Preparation==
Some women take birth education classes to prepare for a natural childbirth. Several books are also available with information to help women prepare. A midwife or doula may include preparation for a natural birth as part of the prenatal care services. However, a study published in 2009 suggests that preparation alone is not enough to ensure an intervention-free outcome.

Women who choose to do home births appear to take more measures in preparation for their birth compared to women who choose to do hospital births. According to a study of 19 women looking at home and hospital births in Australia, the women who participated in home births had more preparation and expectations compared to those who had hospital births. A mother in this study who had a home birth went to two different antenatal classes, read Spiritual Midwifery (Gaskin, 2002) three times, and knew about home birth and its qualities very well. In contrast, another mother in the study who had a hospital birth did not know what a contraction was. Many of the mothers who had home births reported taking pain management classes, and yoga classes to go into the birth having a positive mindset. They also participated in more antenatal classes than women who went through hospital births. This implies a higher sense of responsibility and control for women who go through with home births.

==Criticism==

Some argue that the push towards natural childbirth in Western countries has transformed from a way of empowering women into a way of shaming and bullying women who need medical interventions. Some women express shame when not able to have a &quot;natural birth,&quot; feeling that their bodies may be defective or lessen the experiences of individuals using assisted reproductive technologies, or who are adoptive parents and parents who use surrogates.

Home birth specifically, even when attended with a midwife, is associated with risks that are not present in hospital births. A United States study of over 13 million births from 2006 to 2009 found that infants born at home have a fourfold higher chance of death in the first 28 days of life compared to infants born at a hospital, and a sevenfold chance of death for firstborns. Another study found that infants born at home have a three times higher chance of death in the first 28 days of life. Additionally, it found that up to 37% of first time mothers and 9% of non first time mothers intending home birth must be transferred to a hospital during childbirth. Home births attended by undertrained midwives are also associated with increased risks compared to those attended by midwives who are highly trained and well-integrated into the healthcare system.

<doc id="525808" wikidata="Q1742178" url="?curid=525808" title="King's Bounty">
<text>King&#x27;s Bounty is a turn-based fantasy video game designed by Jon Van Caneghem and published by New World Computing in 1990. The game follows the player&#x27;s character, a hero of King Maximus, appointed with the job of retrieving the Sceptre of Order from the forces of chaos, led by Arech Dragonbreath. &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; is notably considered the forerunner of the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series of games.

A Sega Genesis port was developed and released in North America on February 21, 1991, with a multitude of graphical changes. The gameplay was also modified to incorporate real time overworld exploration.

In 2008, a spiritual sequel titled &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: The Legend&quot; was released. This was followed by additional sequels including &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Armored Princess&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Crossworlds&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Warriors of the North&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Dark Side&quot; and &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty II&quot;.

==Gameplay==
The player leads the hero and his army across the four continents, acquiring up to 25 pieces of a map revealing the hidden location to the Sceptre of Order before King Maximus dies. Various details of this task are left to player&#x27;s discretion, allowing for flexible gameplay. For instance, not all the scattered map sections are required; if the player is able to correctly determine the location of the sceptre&#x27;s burial spot before acquiring all 25 map pieces, the game is won. If the sceptre is not recovered before King Maximus dies (the time varies depending on difficulty setting), the game ends in defeat. The location of the sceptre, the artifacts and which castles the villains inhabit are all randomized each game, adding to its replayability.

The hero is given a weekly commission from the king to track down 17 villains across the 4 continents. With each defeat of the progressively stronger villain&#x27;s army, the character claims (along with the reward money for the &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; on that villain) another piece of the map revealing the sceptre&#x27;s burial location. Along the way, numerous treasure chests are encountered scattered across the map. Some of these chests represent various events that increase the hero&#x27;s inherent abilities, such as magical strength or weekly income; others may contain one of eight artifacts, which themselves provide a piece of the map, in addition to conferring their own unique powers.

As the player explores, he encounters various types of creatures native to the different continents, some of which are able to be recruited. Most of these creatures are significant upgrades from the normal human forces available to the player at the King&#x27;s castle, and are required to defeat the tougher villain armies. However, as their strength increases, so does the amount of gold required to retain them, which must be paid weekly. Although the player&#x27;s commission can be raised in a variety of ways, such as maintaining a garrison of forces at a captured castle. If their costs exceed their income, they run out of money, their army will abandon them. Furthermore, each of the various army units have either a positive, neutral, or negative predisposition towards other. An army composed of creatures that &quot;dislike&quot; each other lowers their &quot;morale&quot;, making them less effective in combat. Conversely, recruiting creatures which share a positive predisposition towards each other increases their morale. Assembling an &quot;ideal&quot; army is another open-ended aspect of the game.

&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; features four selectable hero classes: Barbarian, Knight, Paladin, and Sorceress. Each class varies in magical ability, starting troop power, natural leadership ability, and Commission (income per week). As the king&#x27;s bounty is collected on more villains, the king increases the rank of the hero. This rank determines in part what troops the hero may recruit, and more importantly, the strength of the hero&#x27;s attributes.

Combat in &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; occurs when sieging an occupied castle or engaging a wandering army on the main map. Combat turns are simple, with the player&#x27;s army moving first, followed by the opponent&#x27;s. Armies are stack-based, with any one stack taking up one square on the battlefield. Stacks can represent anything from one cavalry unit to thousands. The player can use a number of either Adventuring spells, only used in the overworld, or Combat spells. Adventuring spells allow movement to Towns, Castles, create bridges, increase leadership (Raise Control), stop time for some number of moves, finds the villain&#x27;s castle, or creates an army stack if the player has a space (Instant Army). During combat, the player can cast one spell per turn that cause damage via lightning, fireball, or turn undead, can resurrect dead troops, teleport a unit to an open position, freeze an enemy unit so it cannot move, or increase an existing troop through cloning (Clone).

== Amiga ==
The game&#x27;s graphics were completely redone (by Bonita Long-Hemsath and Kenneth L. Mayfield). The hair and skin color of many characters were changed, and many of the sprites representing armies underwent redesign. Mouse support was also added making most parts of the screen interactive, by clicking or hovering.

==&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis==
===Gameplay changes===
The Mega Drive/Genesis port of &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; is notably different from the PC version of the game, the most obvious change being the move into the realm of real time. Armies on the overworld now move on their own and automatically engage the hero. This makes the game arguably more difficult, as a careful player of the DOS version could often maneuver past several wandering armies at a time without being successfully engaged. Also affected is the game&#x27;s time limit. Although it has become harsher, it is somewhat balanced by the fact that trekking across desert squares no longer takes 1 day, and changing continents no longer ends the week.

Gone from this version of &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; are all keyboard controls and hero naming capabilities.

===Graphical changes===
The game uses the same improved graphic set Amiga version had. As a minor change, wandering armies are now displayed according to their most powerful stack, as opposed to the generic stacks of the DOS version that corresponded to the current continent. Nevertheless, the graphics remain trademark of New World Computing, with other games like &quot;The Faery Tale Adventure&quot; appearing similar but featuring different gameplay.

==&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; and &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;==
&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; is widely considered to be the precursor for much of the gameplay in the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series (the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; series being the basis for the storyline), both of which were published by New World Computing and designed by Jon Van Caneghem. Among the many similarities, an emphasis on hero development and combat style are especially prominent in both. In the introduction to the player manual of &quot;Heroes III&quot;, van Caneghem credits &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; as the precursor to &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot;. &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; is included in some &quot;HOMM&quot; anthologies, including the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic Compendium&quot; and &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic Millennium Edition&quot;.

The 2001 PlayStation 2 title &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the Dragon Bone Staff&quot; is an enhanced remake of &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; made by 3DO.

==Successors==

In 2007, the Russian game publisher 1C Company purchased the property rights to the &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; franchise and attached the name to a title being developed by Katauri Interactive, a company located in Kaliningrad. Prior to the name change, the game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Battle Lord&quot;. The game was published in 2008 as &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: The Legend&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Armored Princess&quot; was released using the same engine as &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: The Legend&quot;, with a new heroine and other minor new elements.

In 2010, an expansion for &quot;Armoured Princess&quot; was released as a standalone game called &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Crossworlds&quot;. This includes the &quot;Orcs on the March&quot; expansion, two new independent campaigns, and an editor.

In 2012, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Warriors of the North&quot; was released, still using the original engine from the prior games, but with new units, protagonist and story. In 2014 the &quot;Ice and Fire&quot; DLC was released for the game, adding new locations, new creatures and a creature skill system.

In 2014, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: Dark Side&quot; was released, where the players play as the dark side and fight against the light side.

A direct sequel to &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty: The Legend&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty II&quot;, was released in 2021.

== Fan projects ==
An unofficial fan sequel, usually called &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty 2&quot;, was developed in 1992. The author of the sequel is a Ukrainian programmer Sergiy Prokofiev. All text in the game is in Russian, and the messages often feature Russia-specific folklore. No English-language version of the game has been available.

In August 2015, another game called &quot;Royal Bounty HD&quot; was released, which added many of the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; gameplay improvements to the &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; concept.

A free unofficial version of original game (with original graphics and expanded storyline) was published in 2015 by Russian programmer Sergei Markoff, also known as the author of free SmarThink chess engine. The game includes a lot of easter eggs, science jokes and various additional objects like Titan of Braavos and so on.

==&quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; boardgame==
Task Force Games released a &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; boardgame in 1991. Like its computer game counterpart, the object of the game is to catch villains in a fantasy setting, but the villains&#x27; names are different, and three designers, not including Van Caneghem, are credited for the creation of the game. The cover of both the computer game and the boardgame versions are the same, implying some connection between the two.

During the brief period that TFG was owned by New World Computing, the two companies attempted the first ever simultaneous release of a board game and computer game. The two versions of &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; wound up releasing about 9 months apart, and after NWC had sold TFG to former Games Workshop Vice-President John Olsen. Future versions of New World Computing&#x27;s version of &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; were called &quot;Heroes of Might &amp; Magic&quot; to avoid confusion between the two different games that had been designed by different designers. TFG kept the name as the original concept had come from them and the board game designer. TFG never wound up releasing a second version of the &quot;King&#x27;s Bounty&quot; board game.

The common cover art came from one of TFG&#x27;s regular artists.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s reviewer stated that although the game was short (he finished it in six hours), the narrow time limit, exciting battles, and opportunity to gain power made it appealing to adventurers. The game was reviewed in 1991 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #166 by Jager McConnell in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the Sega Genesis version of the game in &quot;Dragon&quot; #175, also giving that version of the game 3 out of 5 stars. The Lessers reviewed the DOS version of the game in 1992 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #187, again giving that version of the game 3 stars. Retroactively, the game was reviewed by Sega-16.com, who - in consideration of its influence on the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series - gave it a perfect 10.0 score.

<text>Bycanistes is a genus of medium to large, primarily frugivorous hornbills (family Bucerotidae) found in the forests and woodlands of Sub-Saharan Africa. They have often been included in the genus &quot;Ceratogymna&quot;, but today most authorities consider them separate. All species in this genus have black and white plumage. The plumage of the sexes is similar, but the casque of the male is larger than that of the female.

Recent genetic data shows that &quot;Bycanistes&quot; is the sister taxon to ground hornbills, this clade having diverged from the rest of the hornbill lineage early on. &quot;Bycanistes&quot; is thought to represent an early African lineage, while the remaining Bucerotiformes evolved in Asia.

==Species==
The genus contains the following six species:

<text>Arthur Bryce Courtenay, (14 August 1933 – 22 November 2012) was a South African-Australian advertising director and novelist. He is one of Australia&#x27;s best-selling authors, notable for his book &quot;The Power of One&quot;.

==Background and early years==
Arthur Bryce Courtenay was born in the Lebombo Mountains in what was then the Union of South Africa, the son of Maude Greer and Arthur Ryder. Ryder was married with six children, and lived with his family, but also maintained a relationship with Greer, with whom he already had a daughter, Rosemary. Maude Greer gave the surname Courtenay to both her children. Bryce Courtenay spent most of his early years in a small village in the Lebombo Mountains in the Limpopo province. He later attended King Edward VII School in Johannesburg.

In 1955, while studying journalism in London, Courtenay met Benita Solomon. They emigrated to Sydney in 1958, married in 1959 and had three sons – Brett, Adam and Damon.

Courtenay entered the advertising industry and, over a career spanning 34 years, was the Creative Director of McCann Erickson, J. Walter Thompson and George Patterson Advertising. His award-winning campaigns included the original &quot;Milkybar Kid&quot; commercial.

Along with Geoff Pike, Courtenay developed the concept behind the Cadbury Yowie, a chocolate that contained a children&#x27;s toy, typically an Australian or New Zealand native animal.

On 1 April 1991, Courtenay&#x27;s son Damon (who was born with the blood condition haemophilia) died at age 24 from AIDS-related complications, contracted through a blood transfusion.

Courtenay divorced Benita in 2000 and acknowledged sexual relationships with other women during their 42-year marriage. Benita Courtenay died on 11 March 2007, at the age of 72, four months after being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. He later lived in Canberra with his second wife, Christine Gee.

==Writing==
Courtenay&#x27;s novels are primarily set in South Africa, the country of his birth, or Australia, his adopted country. His first book, &quot;The Power of One&quot;, was published in 1989 and, despite Courtenay&#x27;s fears that it would never sell, quickly became one of Australia&#x27;s best-selling books by any living author. The story was made into a film, as well as being re-released in an edition for children.

Courtenay was one of Australia&#x27;s most commercially successful authors. He built up this success over the long term by promoting himself and developing a relationship with readers as much as marketing his books; for instance, he gave away up to 2,500 books free each year to readers he met in the street. However, only &quot;The Power of One&quot; has been published in the United States. Courtenay claimed that this was because &quot;American publishers for the most part have difficulties about Australia[;] they are interested in books in their own country first and foremost. However, we receive many e-mails and letters from Americans who have read my books and I am hoping in the future that publishers will recognize that there is a market for all my books in the U.S.&quot;

Courtenay had a very strong work ethic, often writing 12 hours a day, and he normally wrote a book each year during his writing career. He turned to writing in the late 1980s after a 30-year career in advertising. In his lifetime, he sold more than 20 million copies of his books worldwide.

==Death==
In September 2012, Courtenay announced that he was suffering from terminal gastric cancer and that his last book would be &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot;. He died on 22 November at his Canberra home, two weeks after the release of &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot;.

<text>The Tung Chung line () is one of the ten lines of the MTR system in Hong Kong, linking the town of Tung Chung with central Hong Kong. It was built in the 1990s as part of the Airport Railway project, part of the construction of the new Chek Lap Kok Airport. The line currently travels through eight stations in 31 minutes along its route. The line is coloured orange on the MTR system map.

== History ==
In October 1989, the Hong Kong government announced plans to build a new airport on the island of Chek Lap Kok to replace the overcrowded Kai Tak International Airport in the heart of Kowloon.

As part of the initiative, the government invited the MTR Corporation to build a rail link to the new airport. The project initially saw opposition from the Chinese government as it feared the construction would drain the fiscal reserves of the Hong Kong government and leave the Chinese with nothing after the British handed the territory over in 1997.

Both the Chinese and British governments reached an agreement and construction commenced in November 1994. The line was originally named Lantau line but was later renamed Tung Chung line during the construction.

The Lantau Airport rail link consists of two train lines, the Tung Chung line and the Airport Express. Both lines deploy the same rolling stock with differences in interior fittings and liveries. The consultants for the Lantau Airport Railway, such as Arup, Halcrow, Meinhardt, Hyder Consulting, and others, at the time of the construction.

On 22 June 1998, the Tung Chung line was officially opened by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, and service commenced the next day.

On 16 December 2003, an open house for charity took place at the recently completed Nam Cheong station, an interchange between the Tung Chung line and soon to be opened West Rail line. The station then closed on 19 December 2003 in preparation for the opening of the new KCR West Rail, and it was officially opened to public on 20 December 2003. Since then, the number of cars per train has increased from seven to eight to accommodate the additional patronage.

Sunny Bay station opened on 1 June 2005 as an interchange for the Disneyland Resort line. The resort opened its door two months after the station became operational.

Between 2006 and 2007, four new Korean Rotem Emu entered service to improve service frequency. The first train was delivered on 9 February 2006 and entered service on 12 June 2006. Modifications were added to the platforms to accommodate the new trains, which are a few millimetres wider than the original rolling stock.

== Route map ==
==Rolling stock==
== Route description ==
Unlike most other railway lines in the system, the Tung Chung line travels mostly above ground and spans a greater distance. The line shares its trackage with the Airport Express between Kowloon and Hong Kong, Tising Yi and Tung Chung East and before diverging right before Tung Chung station.

The line travels underground from Hong Kong station to Kowloon station across the harbour, then surfaces to the ground to reach Olympic station. Trains continue to travel above ground along the West Kowloon Expressway and stops at Nam Cheong station, followed by Lai King station on a viaduct. Thereafter the line crosses the Rambler Channel and stops at Tsing Yi station on Tsing Yi Island.

Trains then enter a tunnel through the hills of the island and continues on the Tsing Ma Bridge and the Kap Shui Mun Bridge onto Lantau Island. The line continues along the North Lantau Expressway and stops at Sunny Bay before terminating at Tung Chung. The distance between the two stops is roughly and takes approximately 6 minutes to complete.

Some outbound trains do not continue to Lantau but terminate at Tsing Yi station due to the less people continuing the journey towards Tung Chung and capacity constraint of the Tsing Ma Bridge which only allows a maximum of one train per track at all times.

==Stations==
This is a list of the stations on the Tung Chung line.

==Design limitations==
When British Hong Kong was planning to build the Airport Railway (Tung Chung line and Airport Express) in the 1990s, which was a few years before the handover to China, the Chinese government raised concerns about the effect of the project on the territory&#x27;s fiscal reserves, which eventually forced the Hong Kong government to reduce the cost of the Airport Railway. The resulting changes made to the design imposed limitations on the level of service on the line.

* The airport rail link was originally designed to accommodate four tracks, two each for the Airport Express and Tung Chung line. It was later reduced to two tracks where both services share the same trackage. As a result, signal failures can affect both services.
* The Lantau Link section of the line (consisting of the Tsing Ma Bridge, Ma Wan Viaduct, and Kap Shui Mun Bridge) only allows one train to pass through each direction at the same time, raising the minimum headway between trains to 2 minutes 15 seconds. As a result, some Tung Chung line trains terminate at Tsing Yi during peak hours, instead of travelling the entire line.
* The signalling system is not capable of giving priority to Airport Express trains; as a result, Tung Chung line trains stopping at Sunny Bay station frequently impede Airport Express trains, which do not serve the station. Tung Chung Line trains would sometimes stop at Sunny Bay Station for an extended period of time to give way to the Airport Express trains.
* The power supply system restricts the number of trains running between Kowloon and Lai King stations. The system can accommodate a maximum of one Airport Express train and two Tung Chung trains travelling in both directions at one time. The minimum headway on this section of the line is 3 minutes 30 seconds.

==Future development==

===Extension in Tung Chung===
====Tung Chung line extension====
In the Railway Development Strategy 2014, it was proposed that the Tung Chung Line be extended west and a new station constructed at Tung Chung West.

In April 2020, Carrie Lam and the Executive Council approved the detailed planning and design of the Tung Chung line extension project consisting of two new stations. Construction began in May 2023, with the cost of the two new stations expected to be HK$24.2 billion in 2023. is an infill station between and , while would be a new underground station west of Tung Chung and serve as the new terminus of the Tung Chung Line. This extension is expected to be complete by 2029. The project is will extend the line by an additional 1.3 kilometres. The design contract for the extension was recently awarded to British engineering companies Arup and Atkins.

====Oyster Bay ====
===Extensions on Hong Kong Island===

==== Airport Railway Extended Overrun Tunnel (AREOT)====
An underground tunnel, around half a kilometer long, will be built eastwards of Hong Kong station. It will allow Tung Chung line and Airport Express trains to turn around so trains can easily switch directions and enhancing operational efficiency. This project would also include the construction of a new ventilation building, ARB. Construction is expected to begin in 2025 and to be completed by 2032.

==== North Island line ====
Once the North Island line is complete, trains will travel in a tunnel east of Hong Kong station along the shore of the island before merging into the Tseung Kwan O line at North Point. Three new stations - Tamar, Exhibition Centre and Causeway Bay North will form part of the extension.

<text>The Varlık Vergisi (, &quot;wealth tax&quot; or &quot;capital tax&quot;) was a tax mostly levied on non-Muslim citizens in Turkey in 1942, with the stated aim of raising funds for the country&#x27;s defense in case of an eventual entry into World War II. The underlying reason for the tax was to inflict financial ruin on the minority non-Muslim citizens of the country, end their prominence in the country&#x27;s economy and transfer the assets of non-Muslims to the Muslim bourgeoisie. It was a discriminatory measure which taxed non-Muslims up to ten times more heavily and resulted in a significant amount of wealth and property being transferred to Muslims.

==Background==
The Şükrü Saracoğlu government introduced a bill for a one-off tax, which was approved by the Turkish parliament on November 11, 1942. This tax targeted fixed assets, including landed estates, buildings, businesses, and industrial enterprises owned by all citizens but disproportionately affected minorities. Non-Muslim communities, such as Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Levantines, who played a significant role in the economy, were particularly hard-hit, with Armenians bearing the heaviest tax burden.

While the tax was supposedly meant for all Turkish citizens, it disproportionately burdened non-Muslims with exorbitant and arbitrary rates. The consequences were severe—the remaining non-Muslim merchant class was decimated, and many non-Muslim families faced financial ruin. The taxes reached staggering levels, at times surpassing an individual&#x27;s entire wealth. The law applied even to impoverished non-Muslims like drivers, workers, and beggars, while their Muslim counterparts enjoyed exemption. The Varlık Vergisi led to a number of suicides among ethnic minority citizens in Istanbul.


During World War II, Turkey maintained a neutral stance until February 1945. The official rationale for the tax was to bolster the state treasury in preparation for a potential invasion by Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union. However, the primary motive behind the tax was to assert national control over the Turkish economy. By diminishing the influence and control of minority populations in trade, finance, and industries, the government aimed to create a new Turkish Muslim bourgeoisie.

The tax could not be challenged neither by legal nor administrative means, except if there was a duplication. Non-Muslims were given a 15-day window to pay their dues in cash. Those unable to meet the obligation resorted to borrowing from friends or family, selling properties at public auctions, or offloading businesses to gather funds.

For those incapable of payment, they were sent to labor camps in eastern Anatolia. Though workers received wages, half was deducted to offset their debts. Elderly individuals, unable to endure the rigorous labor, collaborated with younger villagers from Aşkale, paying them daily wages to work in their stead. All five thousand sent to the labor camps were non-Muslims, as Muslim taxpayers faced milder consequences. Despite the law exempting those over fifty-five from labor service, even elderly and sick individuals found themselves dispatched. Twenty-one people died in these camps, and their wealth was confiscated by the Turkish government and sold at significantly reduced prices to Turkish Muslims, laying the groundwork for some contemporary Turkish conglomerates. The state also seized property from close relativesparents, parents-in-law, children, and siblingsselling it to settle tax amounts, even if the individual had been consigned to forced labor.

Taxpayers were classified into four separate lists, the &quot;M&quot; list, for Muslims, the &quot;G&quot;, for non-Muslims (&quot;Gayrimuslim&quot;), the &quot;E&quot;, for Foreigners (&quot;Ecnebi&quot;) and the &quot;D&quot; for converts (&quot;Dönme&quot;). Foreign-passport residents in Turkey who gave in a tax return or owned a business were forced to pay a huge capital levy on supposed wealth too, although none of them were ruined or committed suicide. Devoid of any factual basis, the tax seemed to arise solely from the authorities&#x27; whims, prompting foreign embassies and consulates to intervene on behalf of their nationals. During the period, the Turkish press allegedly published &quot;anti-minority&quot; articles and reports.

Official figures revealed that the Turkish government collected TL 324 million (when 1 US dollar equaled 1.20 Turkish lira) through the confiscation of non-Muslim assetsan amount surpassing $4 billion in 2022. According to , the director of finance for the province of Istanbul at the time during the Varlık Vergisi, TL 289,256,246 was collected from non-Muslim minorities, TL 34,226,764 from converts, and TL 25,600,409 from Muslims. Despite the government&#x27;s rigid enforcement of this discriminatory law, it failed to achieve the intended results. Companies, compelled to offset losses, sharply increased product prices, triggering an inflationary spiral that adversely impacted low-income consumers.

==Repeal and aftermath==
International pressure led to the repeal of the controversial law on March 15, 1944, driven by strong criticism from the United Kingdom and the United States. Following its abolition, minority citizens detained in labor camps were released, and though the Turkish government pledged to refund paid taxes to non-Muslims, this promise went unfulfilled.

The opposition Democratic Party (DP) capitalized on its unpopularity in the general election of 1950, which was the first democratic general election in the Turkish Republic, thereby securing a landslide victory against the Republican People&#x27;s Party (CHP).

The enduring impact of these taxes manifested in a lasting demographic shift within minority populations. Many, particularly the Greek minority, perceived an uncertain future in Turkey and sought refuge in Greece. Conversely, some from the Jewish community, having safeguarded assets abroad, managed to rebuild a more cautious life in Turkey. The tax precipitated the closure or sale of small businesses to larger entities, consolidating control in the hands of major business interests. It also facilitated state confiscation of significant minority property in Istanbul, not only reshaping the economy but altering the urban landscape as well. The 1935 Census recorded non-Muslims as 1.98% of the population; by 1945, this had fallen to 1.54%.

In addition, the Varlık Vergisi underscored that being Muslim held substantial implications for Turkish citizenship. Its treatment by the Turkish press highlighted the close ties between the Executive and the Press in the country.

In 1951, Faik Ökte, in his memoirs, admitted to the discriminatory application of the tax against non-Muslims. The Turkish press condemned him as a &quot;traitor to the homeland&quot; for publishing such revelations.

== In popular culture ==
The historical novel &quot;Salkım Hanım&#x27;ın Taneleri&quot; (variously translated as &quot;Mrs. Salkım&#x27;s Diamonds/Pearls/Beads/Necklace&quot;), written by Turkish author Yilmaz Karakoyunlu, recounts stories and witnesses of the non-Muslims during the Varlık Vergisi. The same novel was turned into a film of the same name, &quot;Mrs. Salkım&#x27;s Diamonds&quot;. Members of parliament, such as (MHP), were outraged at the screening.

The Netflix series &quot;The Club&quot; revolves around a Jewish woman who was victimized by the tax and its aftermath.

<text>Cymbidium , commonly known as boat orchids, is a genus of evergreen flowering plants in the orchid family Orchidaceae. Orchids in this genus are epiphytic, lithophytic, terrestrial or rarely leafless saprophytic herbs usually with pseudobulbs. There are usually between three and twelve leaves arranged in two ranks on each pseudobulb or shoot and lasting for several years. From one to a large number of flowers are arranged on an unbranched flowering stem arising from the base of the pseudobulb. The sepals and petals are all free from and similar to each other. The labellum is significantly different from the other petals and the sepals and has three lobes. There are about fifty-five species and sixteen further natural hybrids occurring in the wild from tropical and subtropical Asia to Australia. Cymbidiums are well known in horticulture and many cultivars have been developed. The genome of &quot;Cymbidium mannii&quot; has been sequenced to study epiphytism and crassulacean acid metabolism.

==Description==
Plants in the genus &quot;Cymbidium&quot; are epiphytic, lithophytic or terrestrial plants, or rarely leafless saprophytes. All are sympodial evergreen herbs. Some species have thin stems but in most species the stems are modified as pseudobulbs. When present, there are from three to twelve leaves arrange in two ranks and last for several years. The leaf bases remain after the leaf has withered, forming a sheath around the pseudobulb. The flowers are arranged on an unbranched flowering stem which arises from the base of the pseudobulb or rarely from a leaf axil. The sepals and petals are usually thin and fleshy, free from, and more or less similar to each other. The labellum (as in other orchids, a highly modified third petal) is significantly different from the other petals and sepals. It is sometimes hinged to the column, or otherwise fused to it. The labellum has three lobes, the side lobes erect, sometimes surrounding the column and the middle lobe often curving downwards. After pollination a capsule containing many light coloured seeds is produced.
==Taxonomy and naming==
The genus &quot;Cymbidium&quot; was first formally described in 1799 by Olof Swartz who published the description in &quot;Nova acta Regiae Societatis Scientiarum Upsaliensis&quot;. The genus name &quot;Cymbidium&quot; is means &#x27;little boat-shape&#x27;, referring to the labellum.

In 1848 Blume raised the genus &quot;Cyperorchis&quot; in Fedde&#x27;s &quot;Repertorium Specierum Novarum Regni Vegetabilis&quot; and moved 19 species and 26 hybrids previously included in &quot;Cymbidium&quot; to the new genus. In 1984 Christopher Seth and Phillip Cribb divided the genus into three subgenera &quot;Cyperorchis&quot;, &quot;Jensoa&quot;, and &quot;Cymbidium&quot; and each subgenus into sections. In 1988, Dupuy and Cribb modified the sections. The three subgenera were confirmed by molecular phylogeny, however the sections did not show monophyly.

===Species===
The following is a list of &quot;Cymbidium&quot; species accepted by Plants of the World Online as of April 2022 separated into subgenera:

====Subgenus Cymbidium====
Plants in this subgenus have two pollinia, each deeply cleft with callus ridges

====Subgenus Cyperorchis====
Plants in subgenus Cyberorchis have lips fused at the base to the base of the column. 
====Subgenus Jensoa====
Plants in this subgenus have four pollinia, in two unequal pairs; lips attached to the base of the column, 
===Natural Hybrids===

*&quot;Cymbidium × ballianum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × baoshanense&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × dilatatiphyllum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × florinda&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × gammieanum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × glebelandense&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × hillii&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × monanthum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × nishiuchianum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × nomachianum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × nujiangense&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × oblancifolium&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × purpuratum&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × rosefieldense&quot; 
*&quot;Cymbidium × woodlandense&quot; 

==Distribution==
This genus is distributed in tropical and subtropical Asia (such as northern India, China, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Borneo) and Australia. The large flowering species from which the large flowering hybrids are derived usually grow at low altitudes, while short leaved species, from which compact hybrids with small to medium size flowers are derived, are high altitudes lithophytes and epiphytes.

==Uses==
===Use in horticulture===
&quot;Cymbidium&quot; (abbreviated Cym. in the horticultural trade) orchids are among the oldest horticultural orchids in the world and were mentioned in a manuscript from the Jin dynasty from about 200 BCE and by Confucius. Today they are among the most popular orchid genera in cultivation. They have decorative flowers spikes and are one of the least demanding indoor orchids. To flower well they need a distinct difference between day and night temperatures in late summer. Plants need to remain outside in autumn until night temperatures drop to near .

Cymbidiums have few pests or diseases but can be affected by aphids, spider mites and viral diseases.

===Use in cooking===
The species &quot;Cymbidium hookerianum&quot; is considered a delicacy in Bhutan, where it is traditionally cooked in a spicy curry or stew and called &quot;olatshe&quot; or &quot;olachoto&quot;.

Orange had an urban population of 41,920 at the 2021 Census, making the city a significant regional centre. A significant nearby landmark is Mount Canobolas with a peak elevation of and commanding views of the district. Orange is situated within the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri tribe.

Orange was the birthplace of poets Banjo Paterson and Kenneth Slessor, although Paterson lived in Orange for only a short time as an infant. Walter W. Stone, book publisher (Wentworth Books) and passionate supporter of Australian literature, was also born in Orange. The first Australian Touring Car Championship, known today as the Supercars Championship, was held at the Gnoo Blas Motor Racing Circuit in 1960.

==History==
The Orange region is the traditional land of the Wiradjuri people. Known as the people of the three rivers, the Wiradjuri people have inhabited New South Wales for at least 60,000 years. 
In 1822 Captain Percy Simpson arrived in the Wellington District and established a convict settlement which was called &quot;Blackman&#x27;s Swamp&quot; after James Blackman; Simpson had employed James Blackman as a guide because he had already accompanied an earlier explorer, John Oxley into that region.

In the late 1820s, the surveyor J. B. Richards worked on a survey of the Macquarie River below Bathurst and also of the road to Wellington. On a plan dated 1829, he indicated a village reserve, in the parish of Orange. Sir Thomas Mitchell named the parish Orange, as he had been an associate of the Prince of Orange in the Peninsular War, when both were aides-de-camp to the Duke of Wellington, whose title was bestowed on the valley to the west by Oxley.

Initial occupation by graziers began in late 1829, and tiny settlements eventually turned into larger towns as properties came into connection with the road. In 1844, the surveyor Davidson was sent to check on encroachments onto the land reserved for a village, and to advise on the location for a township. His choices were Frederick&#x27;s Valley, Pretty Plains, or Blackman&#x27;s Swamp. 

Blackman&#x27;s Swamp was chosen, and it was proclaimed a village and named Orange by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1846 in honour of Prince William of Orange. At nearby Ophir, a significant gold find in Australia was made in 1851, resulting in a sporadic population movement which is known as the Australian gold rush. Additional gold finds in nearby areas led to the establishment of Orange as a central trading centre for the gold. 

The growth of Orange continued as the conditions were well suited for agriculture, and in 1860 it was proclaimed a municipality. The railway from Sydney reached Orange in 1877. In 1946, 100 years after it was first being established as a village, Orange was proclaimed as a minor city.

Orange was proposed as a site for Australia&#x27;s national capital city, prior to the selection of Canberra. The new capital city would have adjoined the town of Orange, which would have been included in the surrounding federal territory.

==Geography and Climate==

Owing to its altitude, Orange has a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), with warm summers (though with cool mornings) and cold, wet winters with frequent morning frosts. The city is relatively wet for an inland location owing to orographic effects from Mount Canobolas, especially during the cooler months when snow falls; Orange is the snowiest major city in Australia.

Compared with most population centres in Australia it has colder winters, especially in terms of its daytime maximum temperatures, owing to its westerly exposure. In summer, the average (and absolute) maximum temperatures are also lower than in most inland centres, on account of its elevation. Humidity is low in the summer months with the afternoon dew point typically around . The city features 99.8 clear days annually, with the majority of sunshine in the summer months, in sharp contrast to Sydney which has more sunshine in winter due to the foehn effect.

The climate has enabled the area to be a major apple and pear producer, and a centre for cool-weather wine production.

==Economy==
Orange is a well-known fruit growing district, and produces apples, pears, and many stone fruits such as cherries, peaches, apricots, and plums; oranges are not grown in the area, since its climate is too cool. In recent years, a large number of vineyards have been planted in the area for rapidly expanding wine production. The growth of this wine industry, coupled with the further development of Orange as a gourmet food capital, has ensured Orange&#x27;s status as a prominent tourism destination.

Other large industries include:
* Cadia gold mine is a large open cut gold and copper mine located about 20 kilometres south of Orange. The mine has been developed throughout the 1990s and is a major employer in the region with an expected lifespan of several decades. Cadia is the second largest open-cut mine in Australia, following the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Large mineral deposits are also being uncovered from the more recently developed Ridgeway underground mine which is adjacent to the Cadia Mine.
*An Electrolux white goods factory, closed in 2017.
Orange is also the location of the headquarters of the New South Wales Department of Industry (Department of Industry, Skills and Regional Development, the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries).

==Winemaking==

The Orange wine region is defined as the area above 600m in the local government areas of Orange, Cabonne and Blayney and can be usefully described as a circle around Orange. The Orange region is good for grape growing and winemaking due to a combination of geology, soils, climate and temperature. Together these factors combine to produce grapes and wine of distinct flavours and colour. The climate perhaps plays the biggest part in giving Orange some distinct natural advantages – the cool temperatures during most of the growing season coupled with dry autumn conditions are ideal for grape growing.

<doc id="525837" wikidata="Q6508537" url="?curid=525837" title="Leader of the Opposition (Fiji)">
<text>In Fiji, the Leader of the Opposition (or Opposition Leader) is a senior politician who commands the support of the Official Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is, by convention, the leader of the largest political party in the Parliament of Fiji that is not in government. This is usually this is the parliamentary leader of the second-largest caucus in Parliament. It did not originate in Fiji but has a long tradition; in British constitutional theory, the Leader of the Opposition must pose a formal alternative to the government, ready to form a government himself should the Prime Minister lose the confidence of the parliament.

Typically the leader of the Opposition is elected by his or her party according to its rules. A new leader may be elected when the incumbent dies, resigns, or is challenged for the leadership. Inia Seruiratu of the FijiFirst party (independent since 2024) has been serving as the leader of the opposition since 29 March 2023.

==Description of the office==
The Leader of the Opposition is chosen by a vote of all members of Parliament who declare that they do not support the government. But before the adoption of the 2013 Constitution, the Leader of the Opposition was formally appointed by the President. The appointment was not at the president&#x27;s personal discretion, however, as he was required by the Constitution to appoint the person most acceptable to the majority of the Opposition (defined as members of the House of Representatives who belong to political parties not represented in the Cabinet). In theory, that meant the parliamentary leader of the largest Opposition party. In practice, the person most eligible could decline the office, as was the case between 2001 and 2004, when Mahendra Chaudhry, whose Labour Party held 28 of the 30 Opposition seats in the House of Representatives, adamantly refused to accept the position of Leader of the Opposition, insisting that he and his party wanted representation in the Cabinet instead. Until he reversed his position late in 2004 (following the collapse of negotiations with Prime Minister Qarase), this forced the President to appoint Mick Beddoes, the sole parliamentary representative of the United General Party, as Leader of the Opposition.

Under the 1997 Constitution, the Leader of the Opposition chose 8 of the 32 members of the Senate, Fiji&#x27;s upper house of Parliament, and had the right to be consulted about the appointment of the Chief Justice.

<text>Boorowa () is a farming village in the Hilltops Region in the south west slopes of New South Wales, Australia. 
It is located in a valley southwest of Sydney around above sea-level. The town is in Hilltops Council local government area.

==History==
Before the arrival of Europeans, the area was part of the lands occupied by the Wiradjuri Nation with the Gandangara Aboriginal Australians. It is believed that the name &#x27;Burrowa&#x27;, the original spelling, derives from the local Aboriginal language and refers to a native bird, the plains turkey Australian bustard.

The first European to travel through what is now Boorowa Shire was surveyor George Evans in 1815. Unofficial occupation of the district began in 1821 with Irishmen Rodger Corcoran and Ned Ryan, both former convicts who had received their &#x27;ticket of leave&#x27; from the Governor. The first land grant in the general area was issued to Thomas Icely in 1829. A mill was operating on the future town site of Boorowa by 1837, along with an inn and several houses.

Governor Gipps proposed the creation of a village named &#x27;Burrowa&#x27; in 1842, to be located 9 km north-east of the present site at Kings Plains which had been surveyed in 1828. However, that spot proved unsuitable and the village was established on its present site in 1843. The early years in the district saw lawlessness and mayhem as a result of long running boundary disputes, theft of livestock and arson, even murders; the cause being remoteness and lack of law and order. Bushrangers roamed the surrounding unsettled wild mountainous land, making raids into the town and stations of the district.

Squatters took up large tracts of land in the Boorowa area but the introduction of the Robertson Land Acts in 1861 resulted in a new land grab where large numbers of settlers, particularly &#x27;ticket of leave&#x27; men, applied for a &#x27;selection&#x27; of land with low cost land parcels available.

The district was given over to farming, although it received a push along when gold was found at Carcoar, Browns Creek and Kings Plains. Gold mines were established although copper and iron were also extracted. Samuel Marsden&#x27;s copper mine operated until 1900.

The town&#x27;s rugby league team competed for the Maher Cup during the 20th century.
At the , Boorowa had a population of 1,211 people which had grown to 1,641 in the and 1,888 in the 2021 census.

===Railway===

Boorowa residents and the local member of parliament lobbied the Government to direct the new southern main line progressing towards Goulburn to pass through the town. However the towns of Yass and Murrumburrah won the debate. The next best option was a branch line to the town and this lobbying lasted 40 years before the line was eventually constructed, opening for traffic on 10 October 1914.

The arrival of the railway spurred development. Burrowa&#x27;s name was then changed to &quot;Boorowa&quot;. Boorowa replaced Carcoar as the major service centre to local farmlands. It became a municipality in 1888. By the turn of the century a butter factory and freezing works were major employers in the town. Passenger trains ceased in 1980 and the Boorowa railway line from Galong to Boorowa closed in 1987.

The post office was ordered to discontinue use of the name &quot;Burrowa&quot; in 1914, but the two spellings were used interchangeably throughout the area for many years and the town&#x27;s newspaper stubbornly retained the old spelling on its masthead until January 1951.

===Infrastructure===

The main infrastructure achievements over the 180 years that connected Boorowa to the rest of the Colony included the first Post Office and mail service in 1835, the electric telegraph in 1866, voice telephone in 1906, electric street lighting in the 1920s by the towns own generator, later the town and consumers were connected to the Burrinjuck Hydro electricity system in 1938.

==Environment==

The town is located on the Boorowa River, a tributary of the Lachlan River. The Murrumbidgee River drains the southern portion of the Boorowa district. The soil in the area is rich volcanic soil washed down over millennia from an extinct volcano known as Mount Canemumbola.

=== Climate ===
Boorowa experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb,&quot; Trewartha: &quot;Cfbk&quot;), with warm summers and cool winters.

<doc id="525856" wikidata="Q838691" url="?curid=525856" title="National Museum of Natural History, France">
<text>The French National Museum of Natural History ( ; abbr. MNHN) is the national natural history museum of France and a of higher education part of Sorbonne University. The main museum, with four galleries, is located in Paris, France, within the Jardin des Plantes on the left bank of the River Seine. It was formally founded in 1793, during the French Revolution, but was begun even earlier in 1635 as the royal garden of medicinal plants. The museum now has 14 sites throughout France.

Since the 2014 reform, it has been headed by a chairman, assisted by deputy managing directors. The Museum has a staff of approximately 2,350 members, including six hundred researchers. It is a member of the national network of naturalist collections (RECOLNAT).

==History==
=== 17th–18th century ===
The museum was formally established on June 10, 1793, by the French Convention, the government during the French Revolution, at the same time that it established the Louvre Museum. But its origins went back much further, to the Royal Garden of Medicinal Plants, which was created by King Louis XIII in 1635, and was directed and run by the royal physicians. A royal proclamation of the boy-king Louis XV on 31 March 1718, removed the purely medical function. Besides growing and studying plants useful for health, the royal garden offered public lectures on botany, chemistry, and comparative anatomy. In 1729, the chateau in the garden was enlarged with an upper floor, and transformed into the cabinet of natural history, designed for the royal collections of zoology and mineralogy. A series of greenhouses were constructed on the west side of the garden, to study the plants and animals collected by French explorers for their for medical and commercial uses.

From 1739 until 1788, the garden was under the direction of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the leading naturalists of the Enlightenment. Though he did not go on scientific expeditions himself, he wrote a monumental and influential work, &quot;Natural History&quot;, in thirty-six volumes, published between 1749 and 1788. In his books, he challenged the traditional religious ideas that nature had not changed since the creation; he suggested that the earth was seventy-five thousand years old, divided into seven periods, with man arriving in the most recent. He also helped fund much research, through the iron foundry which he owned and directed. His statue is prominently placed in front of the Gallery of Evolution.

Following the French Revolution the museum was reorganized, with twelve professorships of equal rank. Some of its early professors included eminent comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier and the pioneers of the theory of evolution, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The museum&#x27;s aims were to instruct the public, put together collections and conduct scientific research. The naturalist Louis Jean Marie Daubenton wrote extensively about biology for the pioneer French Encyclopédie, and gave his name to several newly discovered species. The museum sent its trained botanists on scientific expeditions around the world. Major figures in the museum included Déodat de Dolomieu, who gave his name to the mineral dolomite and to a volcano on Reunion island, and the botanist Rene Desfontaines, who spent two years collecting plants for study Tunisia and Algeria, and whose book &quot;Flora Atlantica&quot; (1798–1799, 2 vols), added three hundred genera new to science.

When Napoleon Bonaparte launched his military campaign to conquer Egypt in 1798, his army was accompanied by more than 154 scientists, including botanists, chemists, mineralogists, including Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, Vivant Denon, Joseph Fourier, and Claude Louis Berthollet, who together took back a large quantity of specimens and illustrations to enrich the collections of the museum.

=== 19th century ===

The museum continued to flourish during the 19th century, particularly under the direction of chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, His research with animal fats revolutionized the manufacture of soap and of candles and led to his isolation of the heptadecanoic (margaric), stearic, and oleic fatty acids. In the medical field, he was first to demonstrate that diabetics excrete glucose. and to isolate creatine. His theories of color &quot;provided the scientific basis for Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painting.&quot;

Henri Becquerel held the chair for Applied Physics at the &quot;&quot; (1892–1908). By wrapping uranium salts in photographic paper, he first demonstrated the radioactive properties of uranium. In 1903, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with Pierre Curie and Marie Curie for the discovery of spontaneous radioactivity. Four generations of Becquerels held this chairmanship, from 1838 to 1948.

As its collections grew, the museum was enlarged, with the construction of a new gallery of zoology. it was begun in 1877 and completed in 1889, for the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. A new gallery of paleontology and comparative anatomy was opened in 1898. The cost of construction Drained the museum budget and it began to run short of funds. Its emphasis on teaching brought it into conflict with the University of Paris, which had better political connections. It gradually scaled back its program of teaching and focused primarily on research and the museum collections.

=== 20th–21st century ===
After receiving greater financial autonomy in 1907, it began a new phase of growth. In 1934, the museum opened the Paris Zoological Park, a new zoo to in the Bois de Vincennes, as the home for the larger animals of the Menagerie of the Jardin des Plantes. In 1937, it opens the Musée de l&#x27;Homme, a museum of anthropology located in Palais de Chaillot, across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower, in a building created for the 1937 Paris International Exposition. In recent decades, it has directed its research and education efforts at the effects on the environment of human exploitation. In French public administration, the &#x27; is classed as a &#x27; of higher education.

Some of the buildings, particularly the Grand Gallery of Evolution, completed in 1889, were in poor condition by the mid-20th century. It was closed entirely in 1965, then underwent major restoration between 1991 and 1994 to its present state.

== Plan ==
== Galleries and gardens ==
The birthplace of the museum and a large part of its modern collections are found in five galleries in the Jardin des Plantes. These are the Gallery of Evolution; the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology; the Gallery of Botany; the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy and the Laboratory of Entomology.

=== The Grand Gallery of Evolution ===

The National Museum of Natural History has been called &quot;the Louvre of the Natural Sciences&quot;. Its largest and best-known gallery is the Grand Gallery of Evolution, located at the end of the central alley facing the formal garden. It replaced an earlier Neoclassical gallery built next to the same by Buffon, opened in 1785, and demolished in 1935. It was proposed in 1872 and begun in 1877 by the architect Louis-Jules André, a teacher at the influential École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. It is a prominent example of Beaux Arts Architecture. It was opened in 1889 for the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889, which also presented the Eiffel Tower. It was never fully completed in its original design; it never received the neoclassical entrance planned for the side of the building away from the garden, facing Rue Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire.

The facade of the building was designed specifically as a backdrop for the garden. The facade facing the garden is divided into eleven traverses. Ten are decorated with sculpted medallions honouring prominent French scientists associated with the museum. The central traverse has a larger marble statue of a woman seated holding a book, in a pose similar to that of statue of Buffon facing the building. The statues are the work of Eugene Guillaume, a pupil of the sculptor Pradier.

While the building exterior was neo-classical, the iron framework of the interior was extremely modern for the 19th century, like that of the Gare d&#x27;Orsay railroad station of the same period. It contained an immense rectangular hall, 55 meters long, 25 wide and 15 meters high, supported by forty slender cast-iron columns, and was originally covered with a glass roof one thousand square meters in size.The building suffered from technical problems, and was closed entirely in 1965. It was extensively remodelled between 1991 and 1994 and reopened in its present form.

The great central hall, kept in its same form but enlarged during the modernisation, is devoted to the presentation of marine animals on the lower sides, and, on a platform in the center, a parade of full-size African mammals, including a rhinoceros originally presented to King Louis XV in the 18th century. On the garden side is another hall, in its original size, devoted to animals which have disappeared or are in danger of extinction.

=== Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology ===

The Gallery of Mineralogy, looking across the formal garden and close to the Gallery of Evolution, was constructed between 1833 and 1837 by Charles Rohault de Fleury in a neoclassical style, with two porticos of Doric columns. Directly in front is the rose garden, renewed in 1990 with 170 types of European roses, as well as a Styphnolobium japonicum or Japanese pagoda tree, planted there by Bernard de Jussieu in 1747.

The gallery contains over 600,000 stones and fossils. It is particularly known for its collection of giant crystals, including colourful examples of azurite, Tourmaline (Rubelite), Malachite and Ammonite. Other displays include the jars and vestiges of the original royal apothecary of Louis XIV, and three Florentine marble marquetry tables from the palace of Cardinal Mazarin.

The gallery also contains a large collection of meteorites, gathered from around the world. These include a large fragment of Canyon Diablo meteorite, a piece of an asteroid which fell in Arizona about 550,000 years ago, and created the Meteor crater. It weighs 360 kilograms (970 pounds).

=== Gallery of Botany ===

The Gallery of Botany is on the Allée the Buffon facing the centre of the garden, between the Gallery of Mineralogy and the Gallery of Paleontology. At the corner is one of the two oldest trees in Paris, a Robinia pseudoacacia or black locust, planted in 1635 by Vespasien Robin, the royal gardener and botanist, from an earlier tree brought from America by his brother, also a botanist, in 1601. It is tied in age with another from the same source planted at the same time on the square of Saint-Julien-le-Pauvre.

The Gallery was built in 1930–35 with a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. Directly in front is a statue entitled &quot;Science and Mystery&quot; by J.L.D. Schroeder, made in 1889. It represents the enigma of and old man meditating over an egg and a chicken, pondering which came first.

The primary content of the gallery is the Herbier National, a collection representing 7.5 million plants collected since the founding of the museum. They are divided for study into Spermatophytes, plants which reproduce with seeds, and cryptogams, plants which reproduce with spores, such as algae, lichens and mushrooms. Many of the plants were collected by Jean Baptiste Christophore Fusée Aublet, the royal pharmacist and botanist in French Guiana. In 1775 he published his &quot;Histoire des plantes de la Guiane Française&quot; describing 576 genera and 1,241 species of neotropical plants, including more than 400 species that were new to science, at a time when only 20,000 plants had been described,

The ground floor interior of the gallery has vestibules built in a combination of Art Deco and Neo-Egyptian styles. It is used for temporary exhibits. The exhibits include a slice of a giant Sequoia tree, 2200 years old, which fell naturally in 1917.

=== The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy ===
The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy was built between 1894 and 1897 by architect Ferdinand Dutert, who had built the innovative iron-framed Galerie des machines at the 1889 Paris Exposition. A new pavilion in the same style was added to the west side of the gallery; it was completed in 1961. In front of the Gallery is the Iris Garden, created in 1964, which displays 260 varieties of iris flowers, and a sculpture, &quot;Nymph with a pitcher&quot; (1837) by Isidore Hippolyte Brion. The sides of gallery are also decorated with sculpture; twelve relief sculptures of animals in bronze and fourteen medallions of famous biologists. The ironwork grill and stone arches over the entrance are filled with elaborate designs and sculpture of seashells. Inside the entrance is a large marble statue of an Orangutan strangling a hunter, created in 1885 by the noted animal sculptor Emmanuel Fremiet, best known for his statue of Joan of Arc on horseback on the Place des Pyramides in Paris.

=== Jardin des Plantes ===
The Jardin des plantes is the home of the main galleries of the National Museum of Natural History, and a division of the museum, which was born there. The garden was founded by Louis XIII 1635 as the Royal Garden of medicinal plants, under the direction of the royal physician. In the early 18th century, the chateau of the gardens was enlarged to house the collections of the royal pharmacist. In 1729, this collection was broadened into the Cabinet of Natural History, destined to receive the Royal collections dedicated to zoology and mineralogy. New plants and animal species were collected from around the world, examined, illustrated, classified, named and described in publications which were circulated across Europe and to America. An amphitheater was constructed in the garden in 1787 to provide a venue for lectures and classes on the new discoveries. New greenhouses were built beginning in 1788, and the size of the gardens was doubled. The gardens served as the laboratory of scientists including Jean Baptiste Lamarck, author of the earliest theory of evolution, and were a base for major scientific expeditions by Nicolas Baudin, Alexander von Humboldt, Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville and others throughout the 18th and 19th century.

The gardens today include a large formal garden planted in geometric designs; and two enormous greenhouses, keeping tropical plants at a steady temperature of 22 degrees Celsius. The Alpine gardens present plants coming from Corsica, the Caucasus, North American and the Himalaya. The gardens of the School of Botany contain 3,800 species of plants, displayed by genre and family.

=== Ménagerie of the Jardin des Plantes ===
The Menagerie is the second-oldest public zoo in the world still in operation, following the Tiergarten Schönbrunn in Vienna, Austria, founded in 1752. It occupies the northeast side of the garden along the Quai St. Bernard, covering five hectares (13.6 acres). It was created between 1798 and 1836 as a home for the animals of the royal menagerie at Versailles, which were largely abandoned after the French Revolution. Its architecture features picturesque &quot;fabriques&quot;, or pavilions, mostly created in the 19th century, to shelter the animals. In the 20th century the larger animals were moved to the Paris Zoological Park, a more extensive site in the Bois de Vincennes. also governed by the National Museum of Natural History. The menagerie is currently home to about six hundred mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates, representing about 189 species. These include the Amur leopard from China, one of the rarest cats on earth.

==Mission and organization==
The museum has as its mission both research (fundamental and applied) and public diffusion of knowledge. It is organized into seven research and three diffusion departments.

The research departments are:
* Classification and Evolution
* Regulation, Development, and Molecular Diversity
* Aquatic Environments and Populations
* Ecology and Biodiversity Management
* History of Earth
* Men, Nature, and Societies, and
* Prehistory

The diffusion departments are:
* The Galleries of the &quot;
* Botanical Parks and Zoos, and
* The Museum of Man (&quot;)

The museum also developed higher education, and now delivers a master&#x27;s degree.

==Location and branches==

The museum comprises fourteen sites throughout France with four in Paris, including the Jardin des Plantes in the 5th arrondissement. (métro Place Monge).

The herbarium of the museum, referred to by code P, includes a large number of important collections amongst its 8 000 000 plant specimens. The historical collections incorporated into the herbarium, each with its P prefix, include those of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (P-LA) René Louiche Desfontaines (P-Desf.), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and Charles Plumier (P-TRF). The designation at CITES is FR 75A. It publishes the botanical periodical &quot;Adansonia&quot; and journals on the flora of New Caledonia, Madagascar and Comoro Islands, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, Cameroon, and Gabon.

The &quot;&quot; is also in Paris, in the 16th arrondissement (métro Trocadéro). It houses displays in ethnography and physical anthropology, including artifacts, fossils, and other objects.
Also part of the museum are:
* Three zoos, the Paris Zoological Park (&#x27;, also known as the &#x27;), at the &#x27; in the 12th arrondissement, the Cleres Zoological Park (&#x27;), at a medieval manor in Clères (Seine-Maritime) and the Haute Touche Zoological Park in Obterre (Indre), the largest in France,
* Three botanical parks, the &#x27; in Rocquencourt next to the &#x27;, the &#x27; and the &#x27; in Samoëns,
* Two museums, the &#x27; in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac and the &#x27; in Sérignan-du-Comtat,
* Four scientific sites, the &#x27; in Paris, the &#x27;, the &#x27; and the &#x27; in Dinard.

==Chairs==

The transformation of the &quot; from the medicinal garden of the king to a national public museum of natural history required the creation of twelve chaired positions. Over the ensuing years the number of Chairs and their subject areas evolved, some being subdivided into two positions and others removed. The list of Chairs of the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle includes major figures in the history of the Natural sciences. Early chaired positions were held by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, René Desfontaines and Georges Cuvier, and later occupied by Paul Rivet, Léon Vaillant and others.

==In popular culture==
The Gallery of Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy and other parts of &quot;Jardin des Plantes&quot; was a source of inspiration for French graphic novelist Jacques Tardi. The gallery appears on the first page and several subsequent pages of &#x27; (&quot;Adèle and the Beast&quot;; 1976), the first album in the series of &#x27;. The story opens with a 136-million-year-old pterodactyl egg hatching, and a live pterodactyl escaping through the gallery glass roof, wreaking havoc and killing people in Paris (The Gallery of Palaeontology and Comparative Anatomy returned the favor by placing a life size cardboard cutout of Adèle and the hatching pterodactyl in a glass cabinet outside the main entrance on the top floor balcony).

The Pulitzer Prize–winning novel All the Light We Cannot See, by Anthony Doerr, partially takes place at the natural history museum; the father of the protagonist Marie-Laure works as the chief locksmith of the museum.

<text>Goulburn ( ) is a regional city in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, approximately south-west of Sydney and north-east of Canberra. It was proclaimed as Australia&#x27;s first inland city through letters patent by Queen Victoria in 1863. Goulburn had a population of as of the . Goulburn is the seat of Goulburn Mulwaree Council.

Goulburn is a railhead on the Main Southern line, and regional health &amp; government services centre, supporting the surrounding pastoral industry as well as being a stopover for travellers on the Hume Highway. It has a central historic park and many historic and listed buildings. It is also home to the monument the Big Merino, a sculpture that is the world&#x27;s largest concrete sheep.

==History==
Goulburn was named by surveyor James Meehan after Henry Goulburn, Under-Secretary for War and the Colonies, and the name was ratified by Governor Lachlan Macquarie.

The colonial government made land grants to free settlers such as Hamilton Hume in the Goulburn area from the opening of the area to settlement in about 1820. Land was later sold to settlers within the Nineteen Counties, including Argyle County (the Goulburn area). The process displaced the local indigenous Mulwaree population and the introduction of exotic livestock drove out a large part of the Aboriginal peoples&#x27; food supply.

===Indigenous history===
The Mulwaree People lived throughout the area covering Goulburn, Crookwell and Yass and belong to the Ngunawal language group. To the north of Goulburn, Gundungurra was spoken within the lands of the Dharawal people. This was due to Gundungurra people of the Blue Mountains being driven south from their traditional land due to Governor Macquarie&#x27;s punitive parties sent to massacre the Dharawal and Gundungurra People, at the behest of influential settlers.

Their neighbours were the Dharawal to their north and Dharug surrounding Sydney, Darkinung, Wiradjuri, Ngunawal and Thurrawal, eastwards peoples.

=== European settlement ===
The first recorded settler in Goulburn established &#x27;Strathallan&#x27; in 1825 (on the site of the present Police Academy) and a town was originally surveyed in 1828, although moved to the present site of the city in 1833 when the surveyor Robert Hoddle laid it out.

George Johnson purchased the first land in the area between 1839 and 1842 and became a central figure in the town&#x27;s development. He established a branch store with a liquor licence in 1848. The 1841 census records Goulburn had a population of 665 people, 444 males and 211 females. This number had jumped to 1,171 inhabitants by 1847, 686 males and 485 females. It had a courthouse, police barracks, churches, hospital and post office and was the centre of a great sheep and farming area.

A telegraph station opened in 1862, by which time there were about 1,500 residents, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop, two hotels, two stores, the telegraph office and a few cottages. The town was a change station (where coach horses were changed) for Cobb &amp; Co by 1855. A police station opened the following year and a school in 1858. Goulburn was proclaimed a municipal government in 1859 and was made a city in 1863.

The arrival of the railway in 1869, which was opened on 27 May by the Governor Lord Belmore (an event commemorated by Belmore Park in the centre of the city), along with the completion of the line from Sydney to Albury in 1883, was a boon to the city. Later branchlines were constructed to Cooma (opened in 1889) and later extended further to Nimmitabel and then to Bombala, and to Crookwell and Taralga. Goulburn became a major railway centre with a roundhouse and engine servicing facilities and a factory which made pre-fabricated concrete components for signal boxes and station buildings. The roundhouse is now the Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre with steam, diesel and rolling stock exhibits. Rail First Asset Management (previously known as CFCL Australia) operate the Goulburn Railway Workshops.

St Saviour&#x27;s Cathedral, designed by Edmund Thomas Blacket, was completed in 1884 with the tower being added in 1988 to commemorate the Bicentenary of Australia. Though completed in 1884, some earlier burials are in the graveyard adjacent to the cathedral. St Saviour&#x27;s is the seat of the Bishop of Canberra and Goulburn. The Church of SS Peter and Paul is the former cathedral for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Canberra and Goulburn.

The Goulburn Viaduct was built in 1915 replacing an earlier structure. This brick arch railway viaduct spanning the Mulwaree Ponds is the longest on the Main Southern railway line and consists of 13 arches each spanning .
===Proclaimed a city===
Goulburn holds the distinction of being proclaimed a City on two occasions. The first, unofficial, proclamation was claimed by virtue of Royal Letters Patent issued by Queen Victoria on 14 March 1863 to establish the Diocese of Goulburn. It was a claim made for ecclesiastical purposes, as it was required by the traditions of the Church of England. The Letters Patent also established St Saviour&#x27;s Church as the Cathedral Church of the diocese. This was the last instance in which Letters Patent were used in this manner in the British Empire, as they had been significantly discredited for use in the colonies, and were soon to be declared formally invalid and unenforceable in this context. Several legal cases over the preceding decade in particular had already established that the monarch had no ecclesiastical jurisdiction in colonies possessing responsible government. This had been granted to NSW in 1856, seven years earlier. The Letters Patent held authority only over those who submitted to it voluntarily, and then only within the context of the Church—it had no legal civil authority or implications. An absolute and retrospective declaration to this effect was made in 1865 in the Colenso Case, by the Judiciary Committee of the Privy Council.

However, under the authority of the Crown Lands Act 1884 (48. Vict. No. 18), Goulburn was officially proclaimed a City on 20 March 1885 removing any lingering doubts as to its status. This often unrecognised controversy has in no way hindered the development of Goulburn as a regional centre, with an impressive court house (completed in 1887) and other public buildings, as a centre for wool selling, and as an industrial town.
=== Goulburn School Strike ===

In 1962, Goulburn was the focus of the fight for state aid to non-government schools. An education strike was called in response to a demand for installation of three extra toilets at a local Catholic primary school, St Brigid&#x27;s. The local Catholic archdiocese closed down all local Catholic primary schools and sent the children to the government schools. The Catholic authorities declared that they had no money to install the extra toilets. Nearly 1,000 children turned up to be enrolled locally and the state schools were unable to accommodate them. The strike lasted only a week but generated national debate. In 1963 the prime minister, Robert Menzies, made state aid for science blocks part of his party&#x27;s platform.

==Geography==
Goulburn is located a small distance east of the peak ridge of the Great Dividing Range and is above sea level. It is intersected by the Wollondilly River and the Mulwaree River, and the confluence of these two rivers is also located here. The Wollondilly then flows north-east, into Lake Burragorang (Warragamba Dam) and eventually into the Tasman Sea via the Hawkesbury River. The city is located within the Southern Tablelands Temperate Grassland.

===Climate===
Owing to its elevation, Goulburn has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers and cool to cold winters; with a high diurnal range. Its climate is variable much of the year, though generally dry with maximum temperatures ranging from in July to in January. Rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year, with an annual average of . Snow occasionally falls, although rarely in significant quantities due to the rainshadow brought about by the hills to the west-northwest of Goulburn (around Crookwell). Temperature extremes have ranged from .

==Governance==

As a major settlement of southern New South Wales, Goulburn was the administrative centre for the region and was the location for important buildings of the district.
The first lock-up in the town was built in 1830.
In 1832 a postal service commenced in Goulburn, four years after the service was adopted in New South Wales.
The first town plan had been drawn up by Assistant Surveyor Dixon in 1828, but the site was moved, as it was subject to flooding. The new town plan was drawn up by Surveyor Hoddle and was gazetted in 1833.
Goulburn is the seat of the Goulburn Mulwaree Shire local government area (LGA) of New South Wales, Australia formed in 2004. The most recent elections for Council were held on 4 December 2021.

===New South Wales Police Academy===

The Police Academy relocated to Goulburn from Sydney in 1984. From 2002, it was known as the New South Wales Police College; however, the name was changed back in 2011.

The Academy has relocated to the former campus of the Goulburn College of Advanced Education located on the banks of the Wollondilly River. The New South Wales Police Academy is now the largest education institution for law enforcement officers in the southern hemisphere.

Since its relocation there has been significant expansion of the facilities including a new site on the Taralga Road which houses the New South Wales Police School of Traffic and Mobile Policing.
=== Goulburn Gaol ===
Goulburn is home to Goulburn Correctional Centre, more generically known as Goulburn Gaol. It is a maximum-security male prison, the highest-security prison in Australia and is home to some of the most dangerous, and infamous, prisoners. One of these prisoners was Ivan Robert Marko Milat (27 December 1944 – 27 October 2019) an Australian serial killer who was convicted of the backpacker murders in 1996.
==Culture==
=== Theatre ===
Goulburn is home to Australia&#x27;s oldest existing theatre company Lieder Theatre Company, established in 1891. The Lieder Theatre Company presents up to five major performance projects each year, along with numerous community events, readings, workshops, and short seasons of experimental and new work. The company, along with the Lieder Youth Theatre Company, is based in the historic Lieder Theatre, built by the company in 1929.

A former quarry adjacent to the Main Southern railway line in North Goulburn was used to film cliff top scenes in the 2016 film &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot;.

===Sport===
The most popular sport in Goulburn is rugby league. The town has a team, the Goulburn City Bulldogs, who play in the Canberra Rugby League. The club was founded in 2020, superseding the Goulburn Workers Bulldogs. Historically, there have been many clubs in Goulburn, including:
* Goulburn United Roosters (1932–1986)
* Goulburn Workers Bulldogs (1958–1984, 2008–2019)
* Goulburn City (1987)
* Goulburn Gladiators (1991–1995)
* Goulburn Stockmen (1996–2007)

The Goulburn Stockmen played in both the Canberra Rugby League and also the Group 6 Rugby League before folding. The town&#x27;s junior rugby league team is still called the Goulburn Junior Stockmen. 

The Goulburn Dirty Reds rugby union team play in the John I Dent Cup third grade and Goulburn City Swans Australian rules club play in a lower grade Canberra competition. 

The Goulburn Bears Basketball team play in the Basketball NSW Waratah League (Senior). The Bears wear predominantly Navy and Sky Blue. The Bears have been representing Goulburn in Basketball for over 50 years. The Bears defeated the Wagga Wagga Wolves in the 1991 NBL1 East Grand Final 

Other sports played in the town include soccer, cricket and tennis among others.

== Health ==
===Goulburn Medical Clinic===
The Goulburn Medical Clinic was established in 1946 making it the most longstanding medical practice in the city. Historically, it was the first &quot;group practice&quot; of any size established in New South Wales and probably only the third in Australia. The clinic has a mixture of general practitioners and specialists that provide comprehensive healthcare.

==Water supply==
With a history of water shortages, an underground water supply pipeline was constructed to pump water from the Wingecarribee Reservoir in the Southern Highlands to Goulburn, opening in 2011. This pipeline has a capacity of 7.5 ML per day.

The $54 million water supply pipeline was at the time the largest construction project in the history of Goulburn.

==Transport==

Goulburn is approximately two hours&#x27; drive from Sydney via the Hume Highway, or a one-hour drive from Canberra via the Federal and Hume Highways. Goulburn benefited from the 1992 Hume Highway bypass, prompting significant civic rejuvenation and removing 23,000 cars from the city each day. Goulburn&#x27;s city centre was populated by a notable number of eateries owned and operated by Greek migrants, as part of a broader trend of Greek cafes and milk bars in regional Australia. Years after the bypass, the main street featured numerous neon signs advertising businesses that had since gone out of business some of which are preserved today.

Goulburn railway station is the southern terminus of the Southern Highlands Line which reaches from the Sydney suburb Campbelltown and is part of the NSW TrainLink intercity passenger train system. Most services for Goulburn operate to Moss Vale, some north-east, while there are also daily direct express Sydney Central services covered by Sydney&#x27;s suburban Opal card. The station is also served by the long distance Southern XPT and Xplorer trains between Sydney and Griffith, Canberra and Melbourne Southern Cross railway station. All services are operated by NSW TrainLink.

Goulburn also has eight direct return NSW Trainlink buses to Canberra per week giving access to Canberra Airport, city and hospitals.

==Landmarks==

Goulburn&#x27;s second court house was built in 1847; designed by Mortimer Lewis, the colonial architect. James Barnet, the colonial architect from 1862 to 1890, built a number of buildings in Goulburn. These included the Goulburn Gaol that opened 1884; the current court house that opened in 1887; and a post office in 1881. Barnet&#x27;s successor, Walter Liberty Vernon, was responsible for the first buildings of Kenmore Hospital, completed in 1894. St Saviour&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral and Hall were designed by Edmund Blacket. Building started in 1874 and it was dedicated in 1884. It was finally consecrated in 1916. A tower was added in 1988 as part of a Bicentennial project but Blacket&#x27;s plans included a spire which is yet to be added. E.C. Manfred was a prominent local architect responsible for many of the buildings in the city, including the first public swimming baths opened in 1892; the old Town Hall constructed in 1888; the Goulburn Base Hospital designed in 1886; the old Fire Station built in 1890; the Masonic Temple built in 1928; he also designed the earlier building of 1890 it replaced. Goulburn&#x27;s first permanent fire station built 1890 and designed by local architect E.C. Manfred. The city was home to Kenmore Hospital, a psychiatric hospital which was finally closed in 2003. Goulburn remains a hub for mental health with facilities now located at the Goulburn Base Hospital.

===Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre===
The roundhouse at Goulburn was a significant locomotive depot both in the steam and early diesel eras. After closure it became the Goulburn Rail Heritage Centre, a railway museum with preserved steam and diesel locomotives as well as many interesting examples of rolling stock. Some minor rail operators such as RailPower have used the site to restore diesel locomotives to working order for main line use. The Railway Barracks built in 1935 is situated opposite the roundhouse. It accommodated the steam engine drivers, and now converted into an accommodation wedding &amp; events centre.

<doc id="525858" wikidata="Q1971504" url="?curid=525858" title="Saunders-Roe SR.A/1">
<text>The Saunders-Roe SR.A/1 was a prototype flying boat fighter aircraft designed and built by British seaplane manufacturer Saunders-Roe. It was the first jet-propelled water-based aircraft in the world.

The concept behind the SR.A/1 originated during the Second World War as a reaction to Japan&#x27;s successful use of military floatplanes and the emergence of the turbojet engine. Saunders-Roe presented an initial proposal of their jet-powered seaplane concept, then designated SR.44, to the Air Ministry during mid-1943. In April 1944, the Ministry issued Specification E.6/44 for the type and supported its development with a contract for three prototypes. Development was protracted by Saunders-Roe&#x27;s work on other projects, the war having ended prior to any of the prototypes being completed.

On 16 July 1947, the first prototype made its maiden flight. The SR.A/1 was evaluated by the Royal Air Force (RAF), who concluded that the design was incapable of matching up to the performance of land-based designs. Despite interest from foreign governments, including the United States, no orders for the SR.A/1 materialised. As such, it never entered volume production or saw service with any operators. While interest in the SR.A/1 programme was briefly revived following the start of the Korean War, the aircraft was considered to be obsolete by that point and was again rejected.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
The SR./A.1 was directly inspired by the modest successes experienced by the Imperial Japanese Navy in using seaplane fighters, such as the Nakajima A6M2-N (an adaptation of the Mitsubishi Zero) and the Kawanishi N1K. Seaplanes had performed successfully during both of the world wars although, according to author H. F. King, their achievements were often not highly publicised or well known. Prior to the introduction of the Gloster Gladiator, every British shipborne fighter was designed with an interchangeable wheel-or-float undercarriage. In theory, seaplanes were ideally suited to conditions in the Pacific theatre of the Second World War, and could turn any relatively calm area of coast into an airbase. Their main disadvantage came from the way in which the bulk of their flotation gear penalised their performance compared to other fighters.

Both immediately prior to and during the war, Britain made very little use of seaplane fighters, instead relying upon aircraft carriers and land-based fighters as the basis of their military operations, despite the concept having remained popular with other powers, including Japan, Italy, and France. Proposed seaplane conversions were produced for both the Hawker Hurricane and the Supermarine Spitfire to meet operational needs in the Norwegian Campaign, but were largely curtailed following the rapid German victory in this theatre. No quantity production of seaplane fighters followed. It was in this backdrop that British seaplane manufacturer Saunders-Roe recognised that the newly developed turbojet engine presented an opportunity to overcome the traditional performance drawbacks and design limitations of floatplanes. By not requiring clearance for a propeller, the fuselage could sit lower in the water and use a flying boat-type hull. The prospective aircraft&#x27;s performance when powered by Halford H.1 engines was projected to be 520 mph at 40,000 ft.

Saunders-Roe speculated that, as floatplanes could have staging grounds nearer to their objectives than land-based counterparts, both the time and effort involved in mounting missions, particularly offensive ones, could be reduced. Early jet aircraft were typically restrained in terms of their range due to the high fuel consumption involved, a factor which could be overcome by bringing forward their staging areas, something which a floatplane would be readily capable of doing. Re-basing to virtually any body of water could also be performed with little in the way of setup or ground preparation, according to the company.

===Order and production preparations===
Saunders-Roe first presented their idea, then designated as the &quot;SR.44&quot;, to the Air Ministry during mid-1943. Criticisms of the design were produced by Ministry officials, included the observation that the wing thickness/chord ratio was considered to be too high for a high-speed fighter when operating at a high altitude. In response to these criticisms, the seaplane&#x27;s design was modified and refined. During April 1944, the Air Ministry issued Specification E.6/44 in direct response to the modified design. In the following month, an accompanying development contract covering the production of three prototypes was issued to Saunders-Roe.

At this point, there were intentions for the SR.A/1 to be used in the Pacific theatre against Japan; as such, there were measures taken even at an early stage of development to support immediate quantity production. However, shortly following the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, Saunders-Roe opted to concentrate its efforts on the Saunders-Roe Princess, a long-range civilian flying boat project, a choice which caused development of the fighter to slip behind. Due to the war&#x27;s end, pressure for the commencement of the type&#x27;s production had lessened significantly.

===Flight testing and cancellation===
On 16 July 1947, the first prototype, piloted by Geoffrey Tyson, conducted its maiden flight. Barely two weeks later, Tyson flew the fifth flight for a crowd of officials representing multiple organisations, including the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Saunders-Roe, Metropolitan-Vickers and at least one unidentified foreign government. Subsequent flight testing with the prototypes revealed that the SR.A/1 possessed a relatively good level of performance and handling. Its agility was publicly displayed when Tyson performed a demonstration of high-speed aerobatics and inverted flight above an international audience at the 1948 Farnborough Airshow while piloting the type. During the flight test programme, two of the three prototypes suffered accidents, leading to an interruption in the trials and modifications being made to the remaining intact aircraft.

TG263 appeared in a Pathé Newsreel in July 1947. TG271 appeared in a BBC Newsreel in August 1948.

The SR.A/1 possessed a somewhat small and heavily framed cockpit canopy, which provided the pilot with a poor view outside the aircraft, a particularly negative feature for a prospective fighter aircraft. Despite this, the pressurised cockpit was relatively spacious, providing enough room to accommodate an additional crew member potentially; an observer could also have been seated in a more rearward position. As a measure to increase survivability, two of the SR.A/1 prototypes were fitted with the first two production Martin-Baker ejection seats to be built. An automatic mooring system was incorporated, allowing the pilot to moor the aircraft without any external aids or even having to leave the cockpit. The air intake for the engines was extendable to minimise the ingestion of seawater during takeoffs, although testing revealed only minor performance decreases due to this factor. To reduce drag, the floats could be retracted during flight.
A fundamental problem that emerged during development was that the Beryl engine, which powered the type, had ceased production when British manufacturing conglomerate Metropolitan-Vickers had decided to withdraw from jet engine development, leaving only a limited number of engines available. For any production to have proceeded, an alternative powerplant would have to have been acquired. Despite possessing some favourable qualities, officials judged that the need for such aircraft had completely evaporated with the end of the war. Furthermore, the success of the aircraft carrier in the Pacific had demonstrated a far more effective way to project airpower over the oceans, though Saunders-Roe argued that carriers and their escorts were still very vulnerable to aircraft or other vessels.

Due to a lack of orders, work on the project was suspended, leading to the remaining prototype being placed into storage in early 1950. During November 1950, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, interest in the SR.A/1 programme was briefly resurrected. This interest was not just confined to Britain; data on the project was also passed onto the United States. However, it was soon recognised that the concept had been rendered obsolete in comparison to increasingly capable land-based fighters, together with the inability to solve the engine problem, forcing a second and final cancellation. During June 1951, the SR.A/1 prototype (TG263) flew for the last time. It is now in the Solent Sky Museum in Southampton, UK.

Although the aircraft never received an official name, it was commonly referred to by company workers as &quot;Squirt&quot;.

==P.121 Hydro-ski naval fighter==

Despite the SR.A/1&#x27;s rejection, Saunders-Roe remained interested in the development of military seaplanes, performing several internal design studies on the subject, including some relatively radical concepts. Amongst these were designs that drew or built upon the SR.A/1. During the early 1950s, the company worked on a new fighter design featuring skis aircraft publication &quot;Flight&quot; referred to it as the &quot;Saunders-Roe Hydroski&quot; with the aim of bringing its performance closer to that of land-based aircraft. By adopting hydroskis and dispensing with the hull approach of the SR.A/1, no concessions to hydrodynamic requirements were imposed upon the fuselage. It was designated &quot;Project P.121&quot;.

Work on the P.121 reportedly &quot;received no official support&quot;. On 29 January 1955, the company decided not to proceed with the construction of a prototype.

<text>Jerilderie is a small, rural town in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. It is part of the Murrumbidgee Council Local Government Area. At the , Jerilderie had a population of 922 people.

It can be found along the Newell Highway west-southwest of Sydney and north of the Victorian state border.

The town was raided by Ned Kelly and his gang between 6 February and 10 February 1879, in which the then Bank of Jerilderie was robbed, residents taken hostage, and police locked in the local prison.

== Overview ==
Jerilderie is an irrigated farming centre. The area around Jerilderie produces a quarter of all tomatoes grown in Australia, as well as being a prime Merino stud region. Additionally, Jerilderie has a diverse number of crops such as rice, olives, wheat, canola, mung and soybeans, onions, liquorice, grapes and a number of cattle farms.

The town has two primary schools, &quot;Jerilderie Public School&quot; and &quot;Jerilderie Catholic School&quot;, an 18-hole golf course, three pubs, and a hospital which was the first in regional Australia to operate with solar power. This hospital has now been rebuilt as a multi purpose medical centre that incorporates an emergency room, aged care beds and a palliative care bed.

The town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Picola &amp; District Football League.

== Steel Wings Windmill ==

Jerilderie has rare windmills of unusual design. Both are situated on National Route 39, which provides a straight run from Victoria to the Queensland tropical coast.

The windmill was produced by the Steel Wings Company, in North Sydney between 1907 and 1911 with only six models ever erected. The windmills comprise a steel frame and fan which turns to the wind between a bearing at the bottom and a swivel at the top, all supported by guy-wires. One is also located in the Shire of Taroom in the central Queensland highlands.The fully restored windmills, the only two known working examples in the world, are unique because their fan is contained and spins within the fully pivoting frame.

The Jerilderie Steel Wings windmill, built in 1910, was transported by rail from Sydney and then taken by bullock wagon to Goolgumbula Station for Sir Samuel McCaughey. It provided water to the stations homestead, ram sheds and dams along a channel system. The mill suffered storm damage in 1977, was offered to the town as a historical exhibit and placed in Luke Park which was named after Thomas Raymond Luke (1908–1979) who was one of the main &#x27;stirrers&#x27; for the construction of the lake. Shortly after the lake was completed &#x27;Tommy&#x27; Luke died while water-skiing on the lake he had been so instrumental in creating. (Since the 1960s locals had been skiing on the creek nearby and for years had wanted a more suitable facility.) A secondary use for the lake was to hold excess water from the Billabong Creek which flooded annually.

In 1989, members of Lions, Apex and the then Jerilderie Shire Council repaired and refurbished the windmill with two people, Clive Langfield and George Cornish (now dec.) spending some 600 hours to bring it to its present working condition, pumping per revolution from the Billabong Creek to the Jerilderie Lake using a draw plunger with a stroke. The Jerilderie windmill, the larger of the two stands high with a fan.

== Notable people ==

=== Ned Kelly ===


Jerilderie was visited by Ned Kelly and his gang in 1879. The outlaws captured the town&#x27;s two policemen and imprisoned them in their own cell before dressing in the police uniforms. They then told the locals that they were reinforcements from Sydney sent to protect them from the notorious Kelly Gang.

Later the gang held up the local Bank. More than two thousand pounds were stolen before Kelly and his gang walked to the Telegraph Office and chopped down the telegraph poles. He and his gang held 30 people hostage overnight in the Royal Mail Hotel where Ned Kelly wrote the famous which documents Kelly&#x27;s passionate pleas of innocence and desires for justice for both his family and the poor Irish settlers of Victoria&#x27;s north-east. It has also been described as the Ned Kelly &#x27;manifesto&#x27; and remains the only source providing a direct link between the Kelly Gang and the actions they are accused of.

The current Jerilderie Police Station features no less than 19 structural components mimicking Ned Kelly&#x27;s distinctive face plate. Some examples include walls made of differently toned bricks making up his image to storm drains with holes cut in the same pattern.

=== Sir John Monash ===
Jerilderie is the childhood home of Sir John Monash, honoured military commander whose image adorns the Australian one hundred dollar note. He attended and achieved dux at Jerilderie Public School, a record of which can be seen on a board in the school’s head office. The Sir John Monash Memorial Drive, created in his honour, is just off the Newell Highway, just outside the town on the way to Finley.

=== Lord Loudoun ===
In the early 2000s, a medieval scholar, Dr Michael Jones, claimed Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s claim to the throne was illegitimate because King Edward IV, who reigned from 1461 to 1483, was not of royal blood; he was the illegitimate son of a French archer. Dr Jones concluded that, tracing the correct path, The 14th Earl of Loudoun (usually known simply as Michael Hastings; 1942–2012), who migrated to Jerilderie in the 1960s, was the true King of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth.

=== Billy Brownless ===
Jerilderie is also the childhood home of former AFL Geelong player Billy Brownless. He is a panelist on &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot;, and is a regular panelist on &quot;The Footy Show&quot;. He was previously a co-host on the program &quot;Morning Glory&quot; on radio station SEN 1116, and now he co-hosts The Rush Hour with fellow Footy Show host James Brayshaw a high rating drive program, on radio station Triple M in Melbourne.

== History ==

Prior to European settlement, the Jerilderie region was inhabited by the Jeithi Aborigines, and the name &#x27;Jerilderie&#x27; is thought to derive from their word for &#x27;reedy place&#x27;.

The Jerilderie district originated with the gazettal of the final licences to landholders in the 1870s. Before this time annual licences were issued. The pioneers of that time established cattle stations and it was not until the 1860s that sheep were found better suited to the area.

The birth of the town of Jerilderie itself is traced to the establishment of a house and store by John Carractacus Powell in 1854. He was apparently encouraged and assisted by the Kennedy Family to establish his home and business in what is known today as &quot;Powell Street&quot;, Jerilderie. The Kennedy family were the pioneers who first took up the property known as Mary&#x27;s Creek Run, the station which surrounded the site of the town of Jerilderie. After John Powell first built, in 1859 William Davidson arrived in Jerilderie and he chose the site of the official village to settle on, being the &quot;Cape&quot; region. He had evidently noted the survey of 1852. William Davidson then constructed a brick kiln, the bricks from which he erected a house, hotel and blacksmith shop.

Thus Jerilderie had two establishments, about three kilometres apart, and the business rivalry was keen in each endeavour to capture trade from the travelling public.

Whilst the rivalry continued between Powell and Davidson, a Mr Cadell settled at a site opposite the existing Police Station and erected a store to compete with Powell and Davidson.

The Post Office opened on 1 October 1862 but was spelt &quot;Jereelderie&quot; until 1890.

No other development occurred for some years, but following an application from Mr Powell in 1863 a surveyor was instructed to survey and report on the Jerilderie Village site. As a consequence of this report the Village of Jerilderie and suburban boundaries were Gazetted on 14 March 1865. The village contained an area of , bounded generally by West, Coonong, East and Jerilderie Streets.

With the continual growth of the town and the development of the sheep and wool industry over the years, there became the need for control and development of local facilities and services such as roads, bridges, water supply, etc. Hence in 1889 the area was introduced to official Local Government with the proclamation of the Jerilderie Municipal Council. The Municipality was originally formed in 1885 from previously formed Progress Association but did not gain official recognition and charter until 1889.

Whilst the town had its Local Government authority, the landholders outside the Municipality found the need to work for the establishment of a Shire Council, and as a result of this need the Wunnamurra Shire Council was realised in 1906.

Both the Jerilderie Municipality and the Wunnamurra Shire continued on their works for the following years up to 1918 when the Shire of Jerilderie was formed from the union of the two Councils. In 2016, the Jerilderie Shire was dissolved to form part of the new Murrumbidgee Council.

==Climate==
Jerilderie has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), characterised by hot summers with pleasant mornings and overwhelmingly clear skies, and cool winters with moderate cloud cover. Seasonal range is great across the year.

Temperature data and rainy days are sourced at Urana Post Office, about to the east, while rainfall data are sourced locally at the Jerilderie Treatment Works.
== Heritage listings ==
Jerilderie has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Nowranie Street: Jerilderie railway station

===Rail===
The Tocumwal railway line is a closed railway line that linked Jerilderie to Narrandera in the north and Tocumwal to the south. The line commenced at Narrandera station and then headed south west to Tocumwal station where there was a break-of-gauge with the Victorian Railways Goulburn Valley line from Shepparton. The line was opened to Jerilderie in 1884, extended to Berrigan in 1896, Finley in 1898 and Tocumwal in 1914. The line was closed south of Jerilderie in 1986 and to the north in 1988.

==Population==
In the 2016 Census, there were 1,029 people in Jerilderie, 76.4% of people were born in Australia and 82.3% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 34.1%, Anglican 17.4% and No Religion 15.7%.

<text>Josaia Voreqe &quot;Frank&quot; Bainimarama ( ; born 27 April 1954) is a Fijian former politician and naval officer who served as the prime minister of Fiji from 2007 until 2022. A member of the FijiFirst party, which he founded in 2014, he began his career as an officer in the Fijian navy and commander of the Fijian military.
Despite being suspended from Parliament, he served as the opposition leader from 24 December 2022 until 8 March 2023, when he resigned and was replaced by Inia Seruiratu.

Bainimarama attended Marist Brothers High School, the Asian Institute of Technology and Dalhousie University. He joined the Fijian Navy in 1975 and rose through the ranks, becoming an able seaman and a midshipman in 1976, an ensign in 1977, and later promoted to a sub-lieutenant at the end of that year. He was promoted to lieutenant-commander in 1986 and became a commander in 1988. He later became captain in 1991. In 1997, he was appointed Chief of Staff of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces.

In 1998, he was promoted to a commodore and later became the commander of the Armed Forces in 1999. In 2000, during a coup attempt, he convinced the President of Fiji Kamisese Mara to resign and formed an interim military government, which negotiated with the coup leaders. The military government was replaced by a civilian one by the end of the year. He relinquished command of the military in 2014, and in recognition of his military service, he was promoted to rear admiral.

Bainimarama instigated the 2006 coup, removing Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase from power. He later restored Ratu Josefa Iloilo as president and himself as prime minister in 2007. Bainimarama promised the return of elections and democracy in 2014 and formed a party named FijiFirst. In the 2014 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won a majority, and Bainimarama was sworn in as prime minister of Fiji by President Epeli Nailatikau. In the 2018 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won an outright majority, and Bainimarama became prime minister for a second term on 20 November 2018. In the 2022 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won a plurality but was unable to form a government, meaning Bainimarama ceased to be prime minister after 16 years of rule, making him the second-longest serving Prime Minister of Fiji after Kamisese Mara. He was succeeded by the leader of the 1987 Fijian coups d&#x27;état, Sitiveni Rabuka.

Bainimarama resigned from Parliament and as the leader of the opposition in March 2023. The next day, he was charged with abuse of office over allegations he and police commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho interfered with an investigation into financial mismanagement at the University of the South Pacific. On 14 March 2024, the High Court of Fiji convicted him of attempting to pervert the course of justice. On 9 May 2024, he was sentenced to one year in prison.

== Military career ==
Bainimarama&#x27;s naval career spans three decades. He has received a number of honours for his service. He has been made an Officer Brother in the Order of St John of Jerusalem, and has received the Meritorious Service Decoration, the Peacekeeping Medal for United Nations peacekeepers, the General Service Medal, the Fiji Republic Medal, and the 25 Anniversary Medal.

=== Naval career ===
Following his education at Marist Brothers High School, Bainimarama enlisted with the Fijian Navy on 26 July 1975 and rose smoothly through the ranks, becoming an able seaman in August 1976, a midshipman in December the same year, and an ensign on 1 November 1977.

After completing the Midshipmen&#x27;s Supplementary Course in Australia, he was appointed navigation officer of HMFS &quot;Kiro&quot; in August 1978. At the end of that year, he was promoted to sub-lieutenant. In January 1979, Bainimarama embarked on the Chilean naval training ship, the Buque Escuela &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, which spent six months circumnavigating South America. On his return to Fiji in August, Bainimarama was appointed executive officer of HMFS &quot;Kiro&quot;.

After a brief navigation course in HMAS &quot;Watson&quot; in March 1982, Bainimarama underwent search and rescue training at the United States Coast Guard Centre in New York City. On his return to Fiji, he was appointed commander of HMFS &quot;Kikau&quot;, his first command post. He went on to command HMFS &quot;Kula&quot;, and spent four months in 1984 in the markings of the Exclusive Economic Zones of Tonga, Tuvalu, and Kiribati. After being promoted to lieutenant commander in February 1986, he departed for Sinai where he served for eighteen months with the Multinational Force and Observers.

Bainimarama returned to Fiji in September 1987. He took charge of the delivery of two naval ships, the &quot;Levuka&quot; and &quot;Lautoka&quot;, from Louisiana in the United States. He became commanding officer of the Fijian Navy in April 1988, and was promoted to the rank of commander on 4 October that year. He held this post for the next nine years.

Bainimarama underwent further training at the Malaysian Armed Forces Staff College in 1991 and at the Australian Defence Force Warfare Centre at RAAF Williamtown, Newcastle, New South Wales, where he studied Maritime Surveillance Training. This was followed by Disaster Management training at the Asian Institute of Technology in 1993, and Exclusive Economic Zone Management training at Dalhousie University, Canada, in 1994. He was promoted to the rank of captain in October of that year, and went on to attend the Australian Joint Services Staff College (JSSC). He attended the Integrated Logistics Support Overview course of the Australian Defence Co-operation Program on 23 September 1996, and the Chief of Army Conferences in Singapore in 1998 and 1999, as well as the Chief of Defence Conference in Hawaii.

Bainimarama was appointed as the acting chief of staff on 10 November 1997, and was confirmed in this post on 18 April 1998. On 1 March 1999, he was promoted to the rank of commodore and was named commander of the Armed Forces, to replace Brigadier-General Ratu Epeli Ganilau, who resigned to pursue a political career. It was in his capacity as commander of the Armed Forces that Bainimarama assumed command on 29 May 2000. He relinquished command on 5 March 2014, to Brigadier-General Mosese Tikoitoga. Bainimarama was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on his retirement in recognition of his military service.

=== Fiji coup of 2000 ===

A group led by George Speight, a businessman who had been declared bankrupt following the cancellation of several contracts by the government, entered Parliament buildings on 19 May 2000 and disaffected elements of the Fijian population rallied to his side. For 56 days Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and most of his cabinet, along with many parliamentarians and their staff, were held as hostages while Speight attempted to negotiate with the president, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who denounced the coup and declared a state of emergency.

Believing that President Kamisese Mara was not dealing effectively with the situation, Bainimarama forced Mara to resign on 29 May 2000, in what some politicians have since called &quot;a coup within a coup&quot;, and formed an interim military government, which negotiated an accord under which the rebels would release all hostages, including the deposed Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, and would surrender without penalty. The government later reneged on the last part of the agreement and arrested Speight on 27 July 2000, with Bainimarama saying that he had signed that part of the accord &quot;under duress&quot;.

=== Post-2000 coup ===
Bainimarama attended a Leadership and Change Management course with the Public Service Training and Development program in February 2002, and a Policy Planning Analysis and Management course at the University of the South Pacific in Suva the following month. He went on to attend the Defence and Strategic Studies Annual Conference at the Australian Defence College in Canberra on 2 August, and the Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at Harvard University in the United States from 18 to 30 August. In November that year, he was promoted to rear admiral, but this promotion was reverted to commodore on 1 February 2003. In 2014, he was made rear admiral again.

On 4 September 2003, Bainimarama attended the Pacific Armies Management Seminar XXVII in Seoul, South Korea, and went on to attend the PKO Capacity Building Seminar in the Philippine capital of Manila.

Despite his deteriorating relationship with the government, Bainimarama was reappointed commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces on 5 February 2004. That month, he attended the Pacific Area Special Operations Conference. This was followed by the Seminar Executive Course at the Asia Pacific Centre for Strategic Studies in Hawaii in April. In May and June, he attended the South East Asia Security Symposium. In September, he attended both the PAMS XXVII in the Indian capital of New Delhi, and the 7th Chief of Defence Conference in Tokyo, Japan.

On 14 December 2005, Bainimarama began an official visit to China, at the invitation of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

== Political career ==
=== Fijian coup d&#x27;état, 2006 ===

On 31 October 2006, while Bainimarama was in Egypt visiting Fijian forces on peacekeeping duties in the Middle East, President Iloilo moved to terminate the appointment of Bainimarama, appointing instead Lieutenant Colonel Meli Saubulinayau who declined to take the position. Senior Fijian military officers backed Bainimarama, who quickly called on the Government to resign. The governments of Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and others called for calm, and asked for assurances that the Fijian military not rise against the government.

In late November 2006, Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase, one of which was the withdrawal of three controversial bills, including the Qoliqoli Bill (which would have transferred ownership of maritime resources to the Fijian people) and the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill, which would have offered conditional pardons to persons convicted of involvement in the 2000 coup. Despite further talks in Suva and in Wellington, New Zealand, Bainimarama gave the Prime Minister Qarase an ultimatum of 4 December to accede to his demands or to resign. In a televised address, Qarase agreed to put the three race-based bills on hold, review the appointment of Andrew Hughes as police commissioner (Bainimarama had demanded his dismissal), and give the police the option of discontinuing investigations into the commander&#x27;s alleged acts of sedition. He refused further concessions, saying that he had conceded all that was possible within the law.

Military manoeuvres followed, including the seizure of government vehicles and the house arrest of Prime Minister Qarase. On 5 December President Ratu Josefa Iloilo was said to have signed a legal order dissolving Parliament after meeting with Bainimarama. The president later issued a statement categorically denying signing any such decree, and the exiled Commissioner of Police, Andrew Hughes, implicated Iloilo&#x27;s secretary in the fabrication of the decree at the direction of Commander Bainimarama.

As of 9 December, there were reported arrests of members of the media and open dissenters, as well as incidents of intimidation and violence committed against political figures.

Bainimarama told a press conference on 15 December that he would agree to attend a forthcoming meeting of the Great Council of Chiefs, the feudal body empowered to choose the country&#x27;s president, vice-president, and fourteen of the thirty two Senators, only in his capacity as president of the Republic, the &quot;Fiji Sun&quot; reported.

On 6 September 2007, Bainimarama imposed a renewed state of emergency for one month, alleging that deposed Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and his spokesman were spreading lies and attempting to cause destabilisation, following Qarase&#x27;s return to Suva after having been confined to the island of Vanua Balavu since his ouster. Bainimarama said that Qarase and his spokesman should return to Vanuabalavu and that they could &quot;talk from there&quot;.

Bainimarama became acting Minister of Finance on 18 August 2008 after Chaudhry and the other Labour Party ministers withdrew from the interim government.

==== Explaining the coup ====
The immediate cause of the military coup was Prime Minister Qarase&#x27;s refusal to withdraw the Qoliqoli Bill. Bainimarama stated that his main reasons for overthrowing the Qarase government were that it was corrupt, and that it was conducting racially discriminatory policies against the country&#x27;s Indo-Fijian minority. In a speech publicly announcing the coup, he stated that Qarase&#x27;s policies had &quot;divided the nation now and will have very serious consequences to our future generations&quot;. He added that &quot;the passing of the Reconciliation, Qoliqoli and Land Claims [Bills] will undermine the Constitution, will deprive many citizens of their rights as guaranteed under the Constitution and compromise and undermine the integrity of the Constitutional Offices including the Judiciary&quot;. He explained that he would amend the race-based electoral rolls, so as to &quot;lead us into peace and prosperity and mend the ever widening racial divide that currently besets our multicultural nation&quot;.

Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September 2007, he stated:
&quot;[I]n 1970, Fiji started its journey as a young nation on a rather shaky foundation, with a race-based Constitution, one which rigidly compartmentalised our communities. The &#x27;democracy&#x27; which came to be practised in Fiji was marked by divisive, adversarial, inward-looking, race-based politics. The legacy of leadership, at both community and national levels, was a fractured nation. Fiji&#x27;s people were not allowed to share a common national identity.

Of the two major communities, indigenous Fijians were instilled with fear of dominance and dispossession by Indo-Fijians, and they desired protection of their status as the indigenous people. Indo-Fijians, on the other hand, felt alienated and marginalised, as second-class citizens in their own country, the country of their birth, Fiji. [...]

Fiji&#x27;s overall situation by 2006 had deteriorated sharply, heightened by massive corruption and lawlessness [...].

[P]olicies which promote racial supremacy [...] must be removed once and for all. [...] Fiji will look at making the necessary legal changes in the area of electoral reform, to ensure true equality at the polls. [...] [E]very person will be given the right to vote for only one candidate, irrespective of race or religion.&quot;
This was to be achieved, he declared, through a People&#x27;s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress, the stated aim of which was to &quot;rebuild Fiji into a non-racial, culturally-vibrant and united, well-governed, truly democratic nation that seeks progress, and prosperity through merit-based equality of opportunity, and peace&quot;.

In April 2009, he told &quot;The Australian&quot;&#x27;s Graham Davis:
&quot;My vision for Fiji is one that&#x27;s free of racism. That&#x27;s the biggest problem we&#x27;ve had in the last 20 years and it needs to be taken out. It&#x27;s the lies that are being fed to indigenous Fijians that are causing this, especially from our chiefs who are the dominating factor in our lives. And the politicians take advantage of that. We need to change direction in a dramatic way. We need to get rid of Qarase and everything associated with the 2000 coup and begin entirely on a new path.&quot;
Davis noted that Bainimarama had introduced greater ethnic diversity into senior positions, and suggested that &quot;maybe that&#x27;s what drives Bainimarama most of all; the notion, however quixotic, of a multiracial meritocracy belatedly fulfilling the great promise Fiji had in its early post-independence years, when a visiting Pope John Paul II famously described it as a model for the developing world. Before the greed, the racism and the gun.&quot;

=== 2009 constitutional crisis ===

In April 2009, the Court of Appeal ruled the removal of the democratic government during his 2006 military coup was illegal.
Bainimarama stepped down on 10 April 2009 as interim prime minister.

President Iloilo then announced that he had abolished the constitution, assumed all governing power and revoked all judicial appointments. He reappointed Commodore Frank Bainimarama as prime minister only 24 hours later. On 24 April, the president made him Companion of the Order of Fiji in recognition of his &quot;eminent achievement and merit of highest degree and service to Fiji and to humanity at large&quot;.

On 3 November 2009, Bainimarama banished the envoys of Australia and New Zealand giving them 24 hours to leave the country.

=== Essential National Industries Decree ===

In September 2011, the Bainimarama government introduced a decree severely curtailing labour rights, so as to &quot;ensure the present and continued viability and sustainability of essential national industries&quot;. In particular, the decree banned strikes in all but exceptional circumstances, subjecting them in addition to government authorization on a case-by-case basis. It also curtailed the right for workers to take their grievances to courts of law. The Fiji Trades Union Congress said the decree &quot;offers major weapons to the employers to utilize against unions [...] It outlaws professional trade unionists, eliminates existing collective agreements, promotes a biased system of non-professional bargaining agents to represent workers, severely restricts industrial action, strengthens sanctions against legally striking workers and bans overtime payments and other allowances for workers in 24-hour operations&quot;. Attar Singh, general secretary for the Fiji Islands Council of Trade Unions, said: &quot;We have never seen anything worse than this decree. It is without doubt designed to decimate unions [...] by giving [employers] an unfair advantage over workers and unions&quot;. Amnesty International said the decree threatened &quot;fundamental human rights [...], including the right to freedom of association and assembly, and the right to organize&quot;.

=== Electoral victories ===

Bainimarama promised the return of elections and democracy in 2014, and formed a party named FijiFirst. In the 2014 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won a majority and Bainimarama was sworn in as prime minister of Fiji by President Ratu Epeli Nailatikau. In the 2018 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won an outright majority, and Bainimarama became prime minister for a second term on 20 November 2018. In the 2022 Fijian general election, FijiFirst won a plurality but was unable to form a government, meaning Bainimarama would cease to be prime minister after 16 years of rule. He was succeeded by Sitiveni Rabuka on 24 December 2022. The same day, Bainimarama was elected leader of the opposition.

He has been described by some as a dictator or an authoritarian, although he denies these claims.

=== Suspension from Parliament and conviction ===
On 17 February 2023, Bainimarama was suspended from parliament for three years after making disparaging references to President Wiliame Katonivere and Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, as well as making treasonous comments in breach of standing orders. He remained the opposition leader.

On 8 March 2023 Bainimarama resigned from Parliament and as leader of the opposition.

On 9 March 2023 Bainimarama was charged with abuse of office over allegations he and police commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho interfered with an investigation into financial mismanagement at the University of the South Pacific. The two were released on bail the next day after pleading not guilty. Bainimarama and Qiliho were acquitted on 12 October 2023. On 14 March 2024 the High Court of Fiji overturned the acquittal and convicted Bainimarama of attempting to pervert the course of justice and Qiliho of abuse of office. On 9 May 2024, he was sentenced to a year in jail. On 8 November, Fiji Corrections Service announced his early release from prison.

== Cabinet ==
== Personal life ==
Bainimarama hails from the village of Kiuva in the Kaba Peninsula, Tailevu Province. He is the brother of Ratu Meli Bainimarama and Ratu Timoci Bainimarama, both senior civil servants. He was Roman Catholic-educated and graduated from Marist Brothers High School in Suva. He is married to Maria Makitalena; they have six children.

Bainimarama is a sports enthusiast, with a particular passion for rugby union and athletics; he became president of the Fiji Rugby Union on 31 May 2014. In January 2022, he underwent heart surgery in Melbourne, Australia. During his recovery, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum was named Acting Prime Minister. He returned to Fiji in March 2022.

<text>SIG Sauer is a Swiss brand name of firearms originally manufactured in Neuhausen am Rheinfall. Several sister companies that design and manufacture firearms use the trade name SIG Sauer and it is also registered brand name. The original company, &quot;Schweizerische Waggonfabrik&quot; (SWF), later &quot;Schweizerische Industrie-Gesellschaft&quot; (SIG), went through several selloffs, leaving the SIG Sauer brand spread over several companies. The original SIG is now known as SIG Group and no longer has any firearms business.

* The German company was SIG Sauer GmbH &amp; Co. KG. It was formed in 1976 as a partnership between Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) of Switzerland and J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn of Germany before going defunct in 2020.
* The Swiss company is SIG Sauer AG. Its predecessor SIG Arms AG was sold to L&amp;O Holding in western Germany and was first renamed SAN Swiss Arms AG, commonly known as Swiss Arms, and in late 2019 was further renamed SIG Sauer AG.
* The American company is Sig Sauer, Inc (stylized as SIG SAUER). Its predecessor SIGARMS was founded in Virginia in 1985 to import and distribute SIG Sauer firearms into the United States: Its headquarters were moved to New Hampshire in 1990. This company was renamed Sig Sauer, Inc. in 2007, and since 2000 is organizationally separate from SIG Sauer GmbH.

L&amp;O Holding is the parent company of the Swiss SIG Sauer AG and the American Sig Sauer Inc.

==History==

===1853–1863===
The origins of the SIG Sauer company lie in the company named Schweizerische Waggonfabrik (&quot;Swiss Wagon Factory&quot;), which was founded in 1853 by Friedrich Peyer im Hof (1817–1900), Heinrich Moser (1805–1874) and Johann Conrad Neher (1818–1877).

The group pooled their engineering talents and created the Prelaz-Burnand rifle, known as the &quot;Prélaz-Burnand 1859&quot; or &quot;Prelaz-Burnand 1860&quot; rifle. The invention of this rifle is credited to gunsmith Jean-Louis Joseph Prélaz and army officer Edouard Burnand. The rifle was submitted to an 1860 competition by Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Ministry of Defence. It won and in 1864 the company was awarded a contract to produce 30,000 Prelaz-Burnand rifles, adopted as the M1863.

=== 1864–1975 ===
Upon receiving the 1864 government contract to produce rifles, the company name was changed to Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG, German for &quot;Swiss Industrial Company&quot;), known as Société Industrielle Suisse in French-speaking regions of Switzerland, reflecting the new emphasis on their production.

The SIG P210 pistol was developed in 1947 based on the French Modèle 1935 pistol (the Petter-Browning design was licensed). It was adopted by the Swiss military in 1949 as the &quot;Pistole 49&quot;. This single-action semi-automatic P210 brought SIG much acclaim, due to the precision processes employed in its manufacture and its resultant accuracy and reliability. The P210 frame design incorporates external rails that fit closely with the slide, thus eliminating play in the mechanism during firing. The P210 was noted for its extreme accuracy. The Petter-Browning patent was a refinement of the Browning Hi-Power (P35), which was John Moses Browning&#x27;s last design which was created for the French 1935 pistol, but not adopted.

Swiss law limits the ability of Swiss companies to export firearms. Swiss companies which wish to do this have to do so by using a foreign partner. So in the 1970s SIG purchased both Hämmerli and J. P. Sauer and Sohn, which resulted in the formation of SIG Sauer.

===1976–1984===
SIG Sauer&#x27;s line of handguns began in 1975 with the SIG Sauer SIG P220. It was initially developed by SIG and produced and distributed by J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn, but in 1976 SIG bought J.P. Sauer &amp; Sohn and the resultant company was called SIG Sauer GmbH, based in Germany.

Prior to World War II, Sauer had been primarily a maker of shotguns and hunting rifles. During the war, they produced a handgun, the Sauer 38H, but afterward had withdrawn from this market. With SIG as their partner/owner, Sauer returned to the business of manufacturing handguns. Their Sauer 38H had been produced in competition with other German makers such as Mauser and Walther at a time when new designs began to feature a double/single-action trigger. This double-action trigger mechanism, combined with advanced safety features including the hammer-lowering decocking lever, was incorporated by Sauer into the new P220 design. This new P220 design was derived from the Petter-Browning design and was created in response to a Swiss military and police requirement for a handgun to replace the P210. This new P220 design should properly be called the SIG Sauer system, which was, in fact, the labeling on one of the first SIG Sauer handguns, a modified SIG Sauer P220 design produced for the Browning Arms company in 1977. On the right side of the slide are the words &quot;SIG Sauer System&quot;. This was the first SIG Sauer P220 type sold in the US.

===1985–1999===

In January 1985, SIG established a subsidiary, SIGARMS, Inc, in Tysons, Virginia, to import the P220 and P230 models into the United States. Two years later the firm moved to a larger facility in Herndon, Virginia, and introduced models P225, P226 and P228. SIGARMS moved to Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1990 where production facilities had been established and production began on the P229 in 1992.

===2000–2007===
SIG&#x27;s firearms subsidiaries in Germany and the United States and its firearms subdivision in Switzerland were all sold to Michael Lüke and Thomas Ortmeier&#x27;s L&amp;O Holding in October 2000. Its firearms subdivision in Switzerland became a subsidiary in its own right, SAN Swiss Arms AG, more commonly known as Swiss Arms, although its products still used the SIG Sauer brand.

In 2004, according to CEO Ron Cohen, the company was near failure with just 130 employees. Cohen decided to add AR-15 style rifles to the company&#x27;s product catalog, which he credits with saving the company.
In 2007, SIGARMS changed its name to Sig Sauer, Inc., sometimes called Sig Sauer USA. By 2016, it had over 1,000 employees and was selling more than 43,000 firearms a year.

===2008–2018 ===
In 2014 news reports first emerged reporting arms sales by SIG to Colombia which were in contravention of German weapons trafficking laws. The reporting was corroborated by whistleblowers inside the company including in New Hampshire. It was alleged that SIG had filed false export paperwork with the German government for nearly 38,000 pistols. SIG claimed that the end user of the weapons was in the US when in fact they were in Colombia, a location to which weapons exports were banned by German law.

In 2015, SIG Sauer expanded to include suppressors, optics, ammo and airguns, aiming to provide a greater range of firearm and firearm safety equipment and accessories. Also in 2015 human rights campaigners in Germany brought a lawsuit against SIG for allegedly not doing enough to prevent the use of their weapons by cartel groups in Mexico. 

The US military has produced a requirement for a new handgun to replace the current M9 model (Beretta 92FS). In February 2016, bids were submitted by 12 companies to compete for this contract which was expected to result in purchases of more than 500,000 pieces. On 1 July 2016, SIG Sauer was reported to be one of three remaining competitors who were in consideration for this contract. On 19 January 2017, SIG Sauer was awarded the contract for the P320.

In a press event on 25 July 2018, SIG Sauer announced that its airgun division was renamed to SIG Air, and introduced its Precision Line air rifles, starting with the ASP20 break-barrel gas piston air rifle. 

On 5 November 2018, the United States Coast Guard, which has long used the .40 caliber SIG P229 as its duty sidearm, announced that it will acquire the SIG Air ProForce P229 airsoft pistol (which was then produced under brand licensing by French airsoft manufacturer CyberGun) as its new training pistol to give cadets and guardsmen the ability to practice gun handling, conduct target practice in various environments, and train in realistic force-on-force scenarios. SIG Air announced that &quot;we are rapidly expanding the SIG AIR business, and it is important to us to assume full control to ensure all SIG Air products are of the highest quality&quot;, and they will no longer be licensing the &quot;SIG&quot; brand or trademarks for sale by commercial airsoft manufacturers.

In April 2018 prosecutors in Kiel brought criminal charges against SIG and the executives who had been involved in the illegal arms trafficking to Colombia. Chief Executive Ron Cohen was arrested at Frankfurt Airport.

===2019–2022===
In April 2019 Cohen and two other executives were convicted of breaking export laws. Cohen was given an 18-month suspended sentence and fined $675,000. The German division of SIG was fined $12 million by the court.

In late 2019, Swiss Arms was renamed SIG Sauer AG.

On 4 June 2020, SIG Sauer GmbH announced it intended to close its factory at Eckernförde by year&#x27;s end, resulting in losses of about 125 jobs as well as plans to fulfill purchase orders. It blamed &quot;locational handicaps&quot; hindering its sales, claiming &quot;a few other local producers&quot; were preferred in government purchases for the German police forces and the Bundeswehr. According to SIG Sauer GmbH CEO Tim Castagne, &quot;due to its international orientation, SIG Sauer is systematically excluded from tenders [in Germany].&quot; 

On 19 April 2022, the US Army, following a 27-month evaluation process, announced it had awarded SIG Sauer a contract for two Next Generation Squad Weapon (NGSW) variations, the XM7 and XM250 automatic rifle, as well as for the 6.8 common cartridge ammunition used by both rifles. The initial value of the award was $20.4 million for the delivery of the weapons, ammunition, and accessories. The XM7 and XM250 are planned to replace the M4 carbine and M249 light machine gun, respectively.

In July 2022, the company opened the SIG Experience Center in Epping, co-located with the SIG Sauer Academy. The Experience Center includes a retail store, indoor shooting range, company museum, conference center, and corporate offices.

===2023===
In 2023, the most popular handgun for US law enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, the P-320, came under fire for unintentional discharge of the firearm. The semi-automatic pistol is used internationally, and the 80+ cases were limited to North America. The company said the gun is safe, and the cases were due to improper handling and a lack of gun safety standards. According to gun safety officials, the user can avoid such discharge by &quot;keeping the finger outside the trigger guard until the decision is made to shoot&quot;.

<doc id="525885" wikidata="Q1378951" url="?curid=525885" title="Euthyphro dilemma">
<text>The Euthyphro dilemma is found in Plato&#x27;s dialogue &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, in which Socrates asks Euthyphro, &quot;Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?&quot; (10a) 

Although it was originally applied to the ancient Greek pantheon, the dilemma has implications for modern monotheistic religions. Gottfried Leibniz asked whether the good and just &quot;is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just&quot;. Ever since Plato&#x27;s original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a false dilemma, and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.

==The dilemma==
Socrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Euthyphro&quot;. Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods (τὸ θεοφιλές), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).

At this point the dilemma surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this, in turn, means Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro&#x27;s theory does not give us the very &quot;nature&quot; of the pious, but at most a &quot;quality&quot; of the pious (11ab).

==In philosophical theism==
The dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz presented this version of the dilemma: &quot;It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things.&quot;

Many philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar Terence Irwin, the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries. More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in metaethics and the philosophy of religion. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.

=== God commands it because it is right ===

====Supporters====
The first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God &quot;because it is right&quot;) goes by a variety of names, including intellectualism, rationalism, realism, naturalism, and objectivism. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God&#x27;s commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato&#x27;s dialogue. The Mu&#x27;tazilah school of Islamic theology also defended the view (with, for example, Nazzam maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying), as did the Islamic philosopher Averroes. Thomas Aquinas never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue. Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God&#x27;s commands, with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of natural law. Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding, however, that God &quot;can&quot; change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or stealing). Among later Scholastics, Gabriel Vásquez is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone&#x27;s will, even God&#x27;s. Modern natural law theory saw Grotius and Leibniz also putting morality prior to God&#x27;s will, comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging voluntarists like Pufendorf in philosophical controversy. Cambridge Platonists like Benjamin Whichcote and Ralph Cudworth mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist metaethics of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price; what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God&#x27;s will and prior to God&#x27;s commands. Contemporary philosophers of religion who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson (though see below for complications).

====Criticisms====

* Sovereignty: If there are moral standards independent of God&#x27;s will, then &quot;[t]here is something over which God is not sovereign. God is bound by the laws of morality instead of being their establisher. Moreover, God depends for his goodness on the extent to which he conforms to an independent moral standard. Thus, God is not absolutely independent.&quot; 18th-century philosopher Richard Price, who takes the first horn and thus sees morality as &quot;necessary and immutable&quot;, sets out the objection as follows: &quot;It may seem that this is setting up something distinct from God, which is independent of him, and equally eternal and necessary.&quot;
* Omnipotence: These moral standards would limit God&#x27;s power: not even God could oppose them by commanding what is evil and thereby making it good. This point was influential in Islamic theology: &quot;In relation to God, objective values appeared as a limiting factor to His power to do as He wills... Ash&#x27;ari got rid of the whole problem by denying the existence of objective values which might act as a standard for God&#x27;s action.&quot; Similar concerns drove the medieval voluntarists Duns Scotus and William of Ockham. As modern philosopher Richard Swinburne puts the point, this horn &quot;seems to place a restriction on God&#x27;s power if he cannot make any action which he chooses obligatory... [and also] it seems to limit what God can command us to do. God, if he is to be God, cannot command us to do what, independently of his will, is wrong.&quot;
* Freedom of the will: Moreover, these moral standards would limit God&#x27;s freedom of will: God could not command anything opposed to them, and perhaps would have no choice but to command in accordance with them. As Mark Murphy puts the point, &quot;if moral requirements existed prior to God&#x27;s willing them, requirements that an impeccable God could not violate, God&#x27;s liberty would be compromised.&quot;
* Morality without God: If there are moral standards independent of God, then morality would retain its authority even if God did not exist. This conclusion was explicitly (and notoriously) drawn by early modern political theorist Hugo Grotius: &quot;What we have been saying [about the natural law] would have a degree of validity even if we should concede that which cannot be conceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that the affairs of men are of no concern to him&quot; On such a view, God is no longer a &quot;law-giver&quot; but at most a &quot;law-transmitter&quot; who plays no vital role in the foundations of morality. Nontheists have capitalized on this point, largely as a way of disarming moral arguments for God&#x27;s existence: if morality does not depend on God in the first place, such arguments stumble at the starting gate.

====Responses to criticisms====
Contemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a &quot;subjective theory of value&quot; that makes morality arbitrary. They accept a theory of morality on which, &quot;right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what &quot;anyone&quot; believes, wants, or prefers.&quot; They do not address the problems mentioned above with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God&#x27;s omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of &quot;maximal power&quot;, not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not omnibenevolent). Thus God&#x27;s omnipotence remains intact.

Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to &quot;necessary&quot; moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still effect &quot;contingent&quot; moral truths. On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: &quot;Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued.&quot; This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of logical necessity: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction. This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God&#x27;s sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic. On the other hand, there is still an important role for God&#x27;s will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays. Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God&#x27;s role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners. Second, God can make an &quot;indirect&quot; moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God&#x27;s creative acts: the policy&#x27;s goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.

===It is right because God commands it===

====Supporters====

The second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right &quot;because it is commanded by God&quot;) is sometimes known as divine command theory or voluntarism. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God&#x27;s will: without God&#x27;s commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by Duns Scotus, who argued that not all Ten Commandments belong to the Natural Law in the strictest sense. Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments &quot;are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily&quot;. Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that &quot;those of weak character&quot; would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.

William of Ockham went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God and even to &quot;hate&quot; God. Later Scholastics like Pierre D&#x27;Ailly and his student Jean de Gerson explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not &quot;command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited.&quot; Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God&#x27;s will, with Luther writing that &quot;for [God&#x27;s] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it&quot;, and Calvin writing that &quot;everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it.&quot; The voluntarist emphasis on God&#x27;s absolute power was carried further by Descartes, who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of logic and mathematics, and that God was therefore capable of giving circles unequal radii, giving triangles other than 180 internal degrees, and even making contradictions true. Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: &quot;why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?&quot; Thomas Hobbes notoriously reduced the justice of God to &quot;irresistible power&quot; (drawing the complaint of Bishop Bramhall that this &quot;overturns... all law&quot;). And William Paley held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested &quot;urge&quot; to avoid Hell and enter Heaven by acting in accord with God&#x27;s commands. Islam&#x27;s Ash&#x27;arite theologians, al-Ghazali foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view &quot;was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization.&quot; Wittgenstein said that of &quot;the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good&quot;, that which holds that &quot;the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it&quot; is &quot;the deeper&quot;, while that which holds that &quot;God wills the good, because it is good&quot; is &quot;the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves &#x27;as though&#x27; that which is good could be given some further foundation&quot;. Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).

====Criticisms====

This horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:

* No reasons for morality: If there is no moral standard other than God&#x27;s will, then God&#x27;s commands are arbitrary (i.e., based on pure whimsy or caprice). This would mean that morality is ultimately not based on reasons: &quot;if theological voluntarism is true, then God&#x27;s commands/intentions must be arbitrary; [but] it cannot be that morality could wholly depend on something arbitrary... [for] when we say that some moral state of affairs obtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of affairs obtaining rather than another.&quot; And as Michael J. Murray and Michael Rea put it, this would also &quot;cas[t] doubt on the notion that morality is genuinely objective.&quot; An additional problem is that it is difficult to explain how true moral actions can exist if one acts only out of fear of God or in an attempt to be rewarded by him.
* No reasons for God: This arbitrariness would also jeopardize God&#x27;s status as a wise and rational being, one who always acts on good reasons. As Leibniz writes: &quot;Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act.&quot;
* Anything goes: This arbitrariness would also mean that &quot;anything&quot; could become good, and &quot;anything&quot; could become bad, merely upon God&#x27;s command. Thus if God commanded us &quot;to gratuitously inflict pain on each other&quot; or to engage in &quot;cruelty for its own sake&quot; or to hold an &quot;annual sacrifice of randomly selected ten-year-olds in a particularly gruesome ritual that involves excruciating and prolonged suffering for its victims&quot;, then we would be morally obligated to do so. As 17th-century philosopher Ralph Cudworth put it: &quot;nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just, and righteous.&quot;
* Moral contingency: If morality depends on the perfectly free will of God, morality would lose its necessity: &quot;If nothing prevents God from loving things that are different from what God actually loves, then goodness can change from world to world or time to time. This is obviously objectionable to those who believe that claims about morality are, if true, necessarily true.&quot; In other words, no action is necessarily moral: any right action could have easily been wrong, if God had so decided, and an action which is right today could easily become wrong tomorrow, if God so decides. Indeed, some have argued that divine command theory is incompatible with ordinary conceptions of moral supervenience.
* Why do God&#x27;s commands obligate?: Mere commands do not create obligations unless the commander has some commanding authority. But this commanding authority cannot itself be based on those very commands (i.e., a command to obey commands), otherwise a vicious circle results. So, in order for God&#x27;s commands to obligate us, he must derive commanding authority from some source other than his own will. As Cudworth put it: &quot;For it was never heard of, that any one founded all his authority of commanding others, and others obligation or duty to obey his commands, in a law of his own making, that men should be required, obliged, or bound to obey him. Wherefore since the thing willed in all laws is not that men should be bound or obliged to obey; this thing cannot be the product of the meer will of the commander, but it must proceed from something else; namely, the right or authority of the commander.&quot; To avoid the circle, one might say our obligation comes from gratitude to God for creating us. But this presupposes some sort of independent moral standard obligating us to be grateful to our benefactors. As 18th-century philosopher Francis Hutcheson writes: &quot;Is the Reason exciting to concur with the Deity this, &#x27;The Deity is our Benefactor?&#x27; Then what Reason excites to concur with Benefactors?&quot; Or finally, one might resort to Hobbes&#x27;s view: &quot;The right of nature whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that break his laws, is to be derived, not from his creating them (as if he required obedience, as of gratitude for his benefits), but from his &quot;irresistible power&quot;.&quot; In other words, might makes right.
* God&#x27;s goodness: If &quot;all&quot; goodness is a matter of God&#x27;s will, then what shall become of &quot;God&#x27;s&quot; goodness? Thus William P. Alston writes, &quot;since the standards of moral goodness are set by divine commands, to say that God is morally good is just to say that he obeys his own commands... that God practises what he preaches, whatever that might be;&quot; Hutcheson deems such a view &quot;an insignificant tautology, amounting to no more than this, &#x27;That God wills what he wills. Alternatively, as Leibniz puts it, divine command theorists &quot;deprive God of the designation &quot;good&quot;: for what cause could one have to praise him for what he does, if in doing something quite different he would have done equally well?&quot; A related point is raised by C. S. Lewis: &quot;if good is to be &quot;defined&quot; as what God commands, then the goodness of God Himself is emptied of meaning and the commands of an omnipotent fiend would have the same claim on us as those of the &#x27;righteous Lord. Or again Leibniz: &quot;this opinion would hardly distinguish God from the devil.&quot; That is, since divine command theory trivializes God&#x27;s goodness, it is incapable of explaining the difference between God and an all-powerful demon.
* The is-ought problem and the naturalistic fallacy: According to David Hume, it is hard to see how moral propositions featuring the relation &quot;ought&quot; could ever be deduced from ordinary &quot;is&quot; propositions, such as &quot;the being of a God.&quot; Divine command theory is thus guilty of deducing moral &quot;oughts&quot; from ordinary &quot;ises&quot; about God&#x27;s commands. In a similar vein, G. E. Moore argued (with his open question argument) that the notion &quot;good&quot; is indefinable, and any attempts to analyze it in naturalistic or metaphysical terms are guilty of the so-called &quot;naturalistic fallacy.&quot; This would block any theory which analyzes morality in terms of God&#x27;s will: and indeed, in a later discussion of divine command theory, Moore concluded that &quot;when we assert any action to be right or wrong, we are not merely making an assertion about the attitude of mind towards it of any being or set of beings whatever.&quot;
* No morality without God: If all morality is a matter of God&#x27;s will, then if God does not exist, there is no morality. This is the thought captured in the slogan () &quot;If God does not exist, everything is permitted.&quot; Divine command theorists disagree over whether this is a problem for their view or a virtue of their view. Many argue that morality does indeed require God&#x27;s existence, and that this is in fact a problem for atheism. But divine command theorist Robert Merrihew Adams contends that this idea (&quot;that no actions would be ethically wrong if there were not a loving God&quot;) is one that &quot;will seem (at least initially) implausible to many&quot;, and that his theory must &quot;dispel [an] air of paradox.&quot;

====Restricted divine command theory====

One common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between &quot;value&quot; and &quot;obligation&quot;. Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a &quot;restricted&quot; divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the deontic region of obligation. This response is found in Francisco Suárez&#x27;s discussion of natural law and voluntarism in &quot;De legibus&quot; and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams, Philip L. Quinn, and William P. Alston.

A significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God&#x27;s own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God&#x27;s commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness. God could not issue horrible commands: God&#x27;s own essential goodness or loving character would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God&#x27;s commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands. These proposed solutions are controversial, and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.

One problem remains for such views: if God&#x27;s own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then the question regards what it &quot;does&quot; depend on. Perhaps something other than God. Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness. Alston offers the analogy of the standard meter bar in France. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why &quot;God&quot; is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is &quot;the end of the line,&quot; with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard. On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God&#x27;s &quot;will&quot;, it still depends on &quot;God&quot;, and thus God&#x27;s sovereignty remains intact.

This solution has been criticized by Wes Morriston. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God&#x27;s nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: God is either good because he has those properties, or those properties are good because God has them. Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God&#x27;s essential goodness is the divine-command theorist&#x27;s best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God&#x27;s goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.

Moral philosopher Peter Singer, disputing the perspective that &quot;God is good&quot; and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are &quot;caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?&quot;

===False dilemma in classical theistic perspective===
Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas all wrote about the problems raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like William James and Wittgenstein later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic abstracta independently of God. Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good. Classical Judaeo-Christian theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God&#x27;s omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is. &quot;The classical tradition,&quot; Rogers notes, &quot;also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory.&quot; From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, &quot;Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value.&quot; Another criticism raised by Peter Geach is that the dilemma implies you must search for a definition that fits piety rather than work backwards by deciding pious acts (i.e. you must know what piety is before you can list acts which are pious). It also implies something can not be pious if it is only intended to serve the Gods without actually fulfilling any useful purpose.

====Jewish thought====
The basis of the false dilemma response—God&#x27;s nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC Hebrew prophets, Amos, Hosea, Micah and Isaiah. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before Thales, traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) &quot;Their message,&quot; writes British scholar Norman H. Snaith, &quot;is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,&quot; not least in its &quot;special consideration for the poor and down-trodden.&quot; As Snaith observes, &quot;tsedeq&quot;, the Hebrew word for righteousness, &quot;actually stands for the establishment of God&#x27;s will in the land.&quot; This includes justice, but goes beyond it, &quot;because God&#x27;s will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth.&quot; &quot;Tsedeq&quot; &quot;is the norm by which all must be judged&quot; and it &quot;depends entirely upon the Nature of God.&quot;

Hebrew has few abstract nouns. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities. In contrast to the Greek &quot;dikaiosune&quot; (justice) of the philosophers, &quot;tsedeq&quot; is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:

The Hebrew stance on what came to be called the problem of universals, as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma. This has not changed. In 2005, Jonathan Sacks wrote, &quot;In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist.&quot; Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as &quot;misleading&quot; because &quot;it is not exhaustive&quot;: it leaves out a third option, namely that God &quot;acts only out of His nature.&quot;

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Like Aristotle, Aquinas rejected Platonism. In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness. On this analysis, the abstract &quot;good&quot; in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle&#x27;s definition, &quot;Good is what all desire.&quot; As he clarified, &quot;When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good.&quot; In other words, even those who desire evil desire it &quot;only under the aspect of good,&quot; i.e., of what is desirable. The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.

Aquinas&#x27;s discussion of sin provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. &quot;Every sin,&quot; he writes, &quot;consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good.&quot; Thus, &quot;in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge.&quot; &quot;No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding.&quot; God, however, has full knowledge (omniscience) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed – for instance, by Nicolai Hartmann, who wrote: &quot;There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil&quot; – that this would limit God&#x27;s freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. Josef Pieper, however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly anthropomorphic conception of God. In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence, or even a sign, of freedom (&quot;quodam libertatis signum&quot;). Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, &quot;it does not belong to the essence of the free will to be able to decide for evil.&quot; &quot;To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom.&quot; It is precisely humans&#x27; creatureliness – that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient – that makes them capable of sinning. Consequently, writes Pieper, &quot;the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom – contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue.&quot; Pieper concludes: &quot;Only &quot;the&quot; will [i.e., God&#x27;s] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act&quot; – and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.

Thomist philosopher Edward Feser writes, &quot;Divine simplicity [entails] that God&#x27;s will just is God&#x27;s goodness which just is His immutable and necessary existence. That means that what is objectively good and what God wills for us as morally obligatory are really the same thing considered under different descriptions, and that neither could have been other than they are. There can be no question then, either of God&#x27;s having arbitrarily commanded something different for us (torturing babies for fun, or whatever) or of there being a standard of goodness apart from Him. Again, the Euthyphro dilemma is a false one; the third option that it fails to consider is that what is morally obligatory is what God commands in accordance with a non-arbitrary and unchanging standard of goodness that is not independent of Him... He is not &quot;under&quot; the moral law precisely because He &quot;is&quot; the moral law.&quot; 

====William James====
William James, in his essay &quot;The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life&quot;, dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: &quot;Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true &#x27;in themselves,&#x27; is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due.&quot; Moral obligations are created by &quot;personal demands,&quot; whether these demands come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that &quot;ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well.&quot; However, whether &quot;the purely human system&quot; works &quot;as well as the other is a different question.&quot;

For James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls &quot;the easy-going and the strenuous mood.&quot; In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker&#x27;s &quot;various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power.&quot; Our attitude is &quot;entirely different&quot; in a world where there are none but &quot;finite demanders&quot; from that in a world where there is also &quot;an infinite demander.&quot; This is because &quot;the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands&quot;, for in that case, &quot;actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach.&quot; Even though &quot;exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us&quot;, our postulation of him serves &quot;to let loose in us the strenuous mood&quot; and confront us with an existential &quot;challenge&quot; in which &quot;our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor&#x27;s lectures and no array of books can save us.&quot; In the words of Richard M. Gale, &quot;God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably &quot;good&quot;. This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the &quot;Euthyphro&quot;.&quot;

==In philosophical atheism==
===Atheistic resolutions===
Atheism challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed). This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.

Secular humanism takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy. Some secular humanists believe in ethical naturalism, that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge. Others have adopted ethical subjectivism in the sense of meta-ethics – the idea that ethics are a social construct – but nonetheless by way of utilitarianism advocate imposing a set of universal ethics and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy. These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: &quot;Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?&quot;

===Rejection of universal morality===
The other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by. Moral nihilism challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely. This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.

Alexander Rosenberg uses a version of the Euthyphro dilemma to argue that objective morality cannot exist and hence an acceptance of moral nihilism is warranted. He asks, is objective morality correct because evolution discovered it or did evolution discover objective morality because it is correct? If the first horn of the dilemma is true then our current morality cannot be objectively correct by accident because if evolution had given us another type of morality then that would have been objectively correct. If the second horn of dilemma is true then one must account for how the random process of evolution managed to only select for objectively correct moral traits while ignoring the wrong moral traits. Given the knowledge that evolution has given us tendencies to be xenophobic and sexist it is mistaken to claim that evolution has only selected for objective morality as evidently it did not. Because both horns of the dilemma do not give an adequate account for how the evolutionary process instantiated objective morality in humans, a position of Moral nihilism is warranted.

Moral relativism accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth. This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws). &quot;Normative moral relativism&quot; asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of religious pluralism, strong relativism it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.

==In popular culture==
In the song &quot;No Church in the Wild&quot; from the album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;, rapper Jay Z references the dilemma with the line, &quot;Is pious pious &#x27;cause God loves pious? Socrates asked whose bias do y&#x27;all seek.&quot;

==In American legal thinking==

Yale Law School Professor Myres S. McDougal, formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, &quot;Do we protect it because it&#x27;s a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?&quot; The dilemma has also been restated in legal terms by Geoffrey Hodgson, who asked: &quot;Does a state make a law because it is a customary rule, or does law become a customary rule because it is approved by the state?&quot;

<text>Mehmed &quot;Meša&quot; Selimović (; ; 26 April 1910 – 11 July 1982) was a Yugoslav writer, whose works are widely considered some of the most important in Bosnian and Serbian literature. Some of the main themes in his works are the relations between individuality and authority, life and death, and other existential problems.

== Biography ==
Selimović was born to a prominent Bosnian Muslim family of Serbian descent on 26 April 1910 in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he graduated from elementary school and high school.

In 1930, he enrolled to study the Serbo-Croatian language and literature at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology and graduated in 1934. His lecturers included Bogdan Popović, Pavle Popović, Vladimir Ćorović, Veselin Čajkanović, Aleksandar Belić and Stjepan Kuljbakin. In 1936, he returned to Tuzla to teach in the gymnasium that today bears his name. At that time he participated in the Soko athletic organisation. He spent the first two years of the Second World War in Tuzla, until he was arrested for participation in the Partisan anti-fascist resistance movement in 1943. After his release, he moved to liberated territory, became a member of Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the political commissar of the Tuzla Detachment of the Partisans. During the war, Selimović&#x27;s brother, also a communist, was executed by partisans&#x27; firing squad for alleged theft, without trial; Selimović&#x27;s letter in defense of the brother was to no avail. That episode apparently affected Meša&#x27;s later contemplative introduction to &quot;Death and the Dervish&quot;, where the main protagonist Ahmed Nurudin fails to rescue his imprisoned brother.

After the war, he briefly resided in Belgrade, and in 1947 he moved to Sarajevo, where he was the professor of High School of Pedagogy and Faculty of Philology, art director of Bosna Film, chief of the drama section of the National Theater, and chief editor of the publishing house &quot;Svjetlost&quot;. Exasperated by a latent conflict with several local politicians and intellectuals, in 1971 he moved to Belgrade, where he lived until his death in 1982.

=== Identity ===

Selimović researched the roots of his family and found out that he originated from the Drobnjaci tribe. Most members of the tribe consider themselves to be Serbs, while some are Montenegrins. Bosnian autobiographer Aida Bajraktarević has stated that a part of the Selimović family converted to Islam in order to &quot;protect their Christian brethren&quot;.
In his 1976 letter to the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, Selimović stated for the historical record that he regarded himself as a Serb and belonging to the corpus of Serbian literature. Selimović was a full member of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

In his autobiographical narration, &quot;Sjećanja&quot; (), which Selimović complements with a memoir features thus transforming them into memoir prose, Selimović describes environment and milieu of his Bosnian Muslim origin. He is using discursive self-perception, and confronts and auto-reflect his identity as a complex and composite. Since perception of national belonging is distinctly subjective and simplistic, auto-perceptions are considered discursive creations, representamen, where memoirs overlap with socio-historical context. In doing so, and through lens of imagology, his autobiographical discourse becomes textual construct, or an imaginary discourse. Selimović&#x27;s imaginarium turns his cultural self-reflection of his Bosnian Muslim identity into oddity, but he also describes it as a complex. His memories author then transpose on entire group, with a series of images.

Through the rhetoric of the image, Selimović confirms the cultural differences of Bosnian Muslims, and in that sense, his autobiographical narrative representamen confirms and strengthens the cultural and collective ethnic identity of Muslims. Selimović clearly define himself by stating, &quot;I am a Muslim&quot;, and, &quot;I am attached to my Bosnian and Muslim origins&quot;.

On the other hand, when Selimović brought forward the information about his Christian origin, some Bosnian Muslim critics attacked him, claiming that &quot;they also knew about their origin&quot;, and asking him what is to be achieved with publicly expressing such information.

Critics consider this to be a rationalization of his choice to seek recognition as writer belonging to Serbian literary circle, by claiming that his paternal heritage was that of Orthodox Christian identity, alleging a conversion to Islam back in the 17th century for pragmatic reasons. The chapter &quot;Parents&quot; in his &quot;Sjećanje&quot; provoked reaction and criticism in his native country, and will be deemed a &quot;constructed phantasm&quot;, or imaginary discourse. Critics contemplated about the reasons for this, as they called, &quot;falsification of one&#x27;s own family heritage&quot;, explaining it as a &quot;vengeful act of defiance&quot;, and stating that Selimović&#x27;s main conflicts trace back to his Muslim roots and his expression of disappointment in Bosnian environment and Bosnian Muslim milieu.

He was a communist and atheist.

== Works ==
Selimović began writing fairly late in his life. His first short story (Pjesma u oluji / A song in the storm) was published in 1948, when he was thirty-six. His first book, a collection of short stories &quot;Prva četa&quot; (&quot;The First Company&quot;) was published in 1950 when he was forty. His subsequent work, &quot;Tišine&quot; (Silences) was published eleven years later in 1961. The following books &quot;Tuđa zemlja&quot; (&quot;Foreign land&quot;, 1962) and &quot;Magla i mjesečina&quot; (&quot;Mist and Moonlight&quot;, 1965) did not receive widespread recognition either.

However, his novel &quot;Death and the Dervish&quot; (&quot;Derviš i smrt&quot;, 1966) was widely received as a masterpiece. The plot of the novel takes place in 18th-century Sarajevo under Ottoman rule, and reflects Selimović&#x27;s own torment of the execution of his brother; the story speaks of the futility of one man&#x27;s resistance against a repressive system, and the change that takes place within that man after he becomes a part of that very system. Some critics have likened this novel to Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot;. It has been translated into a number of languages, including English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Turkish and Arabic. Each chapter of the novel opens with a Quran citation, the first being: &quot;In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful.&quot;

The next novel, &quot;Tvrđava&quot; (The Fortress, 1970), placed still further in the past, is slightly more optimistic, and fulfilled with faith in love, unlike the lonely contemplations and fear in &quot;Death and the Dervish&quot;. &quot;The Fortress&quot; and &quot;Death and the Dervish&quot;, as well as the subsequent &quot;Ostrvo&quot; (The Island, 1974), featuring an elderly couple facing aging and eventual death on a Dalmatian island, are the only novels of Selimović that have thus far been translated into English. The posthumously published &quot;Krug&quot; (The Circle, 1983) has not been translated into English.

He also wrote a book about Vuk Karadžić&#x27;s orthographic reforms &quot;Za i protiv Vuka&quot; (For and Against Vuk), as well as his autobiography, &quot;Sjećanja&quot;.

Iranian writer and scholar Poopak Niktalab deemed Selimović one of the three pioneers of children&#x27;s and youth literature in Muslim southeast Europe between 1950 and 1980 (along with Šukria Pandžu and Iskandar Klovnić), who played an important role in the development of Bosnian children&#x27;s and youth literature.

<text>In condensed matter physics, the density of states (DOS) of a system describes the number of allowed modes or states per unit energy range. The density of states is defined as where formula_1 is the number of states in the system of volume formula_2 whose energies lie in the range from formula_3 to formula_4. It is mathematically represented as a distribution by a probability density function, and it is generally an average over the space and time domains of the various states occupied by the system. The density of states is directly related to the dispersion relations of the properties of the system. High DOS at a specific energy level means that many states are available for occupation.

Generally, the density of states of matter is continuous. In isolated systems however, such as atoms or molecules in the gas phase, the density distribution is discrete, like a spectral density. Local variations, most often due to distortions of the original system, are often referred to as local densities of states (LDOSs).

==Introduction==
In quantum mechanical systems, waves, or wave-like particles, can occupy modes or states with wavelengths and propagation directions dictated by the system. For example, in some systems, the interatomic spacing and the atomic charge of a material might allow only electrons of certain wavelengths to exist. In other systems, the crystalline structure of a material might allow waves to propagate in one direction, while suppressing wave propagation in another direction. Often, only specific states are permitted. Thus, it can happen that many states are available for occupation at a specific energy level, while no states are available at other energy levels.

Looking at the density of states of electrons at the band edge between the valence and conduction bands in a semiconductor, for an electron in the conduction band, an increase of the electron energy makes more states available for occupation. Alternatively, the density of states is discontinuous for an interval of energy, which means that no states are available for electrons to occupy within the band gap of the material. This condition also means that an electron at the conduction band edge must lose at least the band gap energy of the material in order to transition to another state in the valence band.

This determines if the material is an insulator or a metal in the dimension of the propagation. The result of the number of states in a band is also useful for predicting the conduction properties. For example, in a one dimensional crystalline structure an odd number of electrons per atom results in a half-filled top band; there are free electrons at the Fermi level resulting in a metal. On the other hand, an even number of electrons exactly fills a whole number of bands, leaving the rest empty. If then the Fermi level lies in an occupied band gap between the highest occupied state and the lowest empty state, the material will be an insulator or semiconductor.

Depending on the quantum mechanical system, the density of states can be calculated for electrons, photons, or phonons, and can be given as a function of either energy or the wave vector . To convert between the DOS as a function of the energy and the DOS as a function of the wave vector, the system-specific energy dispersion relation between and must be known.

In general, the topological properties of the system such as the band structure, have a major impact on the properties of the density of states. The most well-known systems, like neutron matter in neutron stars and free electron gases in metals (examples of degenerate matter and a Fermi gas), have a 3-dimensional Euclidean topology. Less familiar systems, like two-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) in graphite layers and the quantum Hall effect system in MOSFET type devices, have a 2-dimensional Euclidean topology. Even less familiar are carbon nanotubes, the quantum wire and Luttinger liquid with their 1-dimensional topologies. Systems with 1D and 2D topologies are likely to become more common, assuming developments in nanotechnology and materials science proceed.

==Definition==
The density of states related to volume and countable energy levels is defined as:
formula_5
Because the smallest allowed change of momentum formula_6 for a particle in a box of dimension formula_7 and length formula_8 is formula_9, the volume-related density of states for continuous energy levels is obtained in the limit formula_10 as
formula_11
Here, formula_7 is the spatial dimension of the considered system and formula_13 the wave vector.

For isotropic one-dimensional systems with parabolic energy dispersion, the density of states is In two dimensions the density of states is a constant while in three dimensions it becomes 

Equivalently, the density of states can also be understood as the derivative of the microcanonical partition function formula_14 (that is, the total number of states with energy less than formula_3) with respect to the energy:
formula_16

The number of states with energy formula_17 (degree of degeneracy) is given by:
formula_18
where the last equality only applies when the mean value theorem for integrals is valid.

==Symmetry==

There is a large variety of systems and types of states for which DOS calculations can be done.

Some condensed matter systems possess a structural symmetry on the microscopic scale which can be exploited to simplify calculation of their densities of states. In spherically symmetric systems, the integrals of functions are one-dimensional because all variables in the calculation depend only on the radial parameter of the dispersion relation. Fluids, glasses and amorphous solids are examples of a symmetric system whose dispersion relations have a rotational symmetry.
Measurements on powders or polycrystalline samples require evaluation and calculation functions and integrals over the whole domain, most often a Brillouin zone, of the dispersion relations of the system of interest. Sometimes the symmetry of the system is high, which causes the shape of the functions describing the dispersion relations of the system to appear many times over the whole domain of the dispersion relation. In such cases the effort to calculate the DOS can be reduced by a great amount when the calculation is limited to a reduced zone or fundamental domain. The Brillouin zone of the face-centered cubic lattice (FCC) in the figure on the right has the 48-fold symmetry of the point group &quot;Oh&quot; with full octahedral symmetry. This configuration means that the integration over the whole domain of the Brillouin zone can be reduced to a 48-th part of the whole Brillouin zone. As a crystal structure periodic table shows, there are many elements with a FCC crystal structure, like diamond, silicon and platinum and their Brillouin zones and dispersion relations have this 48-fold symmetry. Two other familiar crystal structures are the body-centered cubic lattice (BCC) and hexagonal closed packed structures (HCP) with cubic and hexagonal lattices, respectively. The BCC structure has the 24-fold pyritohedral symmetry of the point group &quot;Th&quot;. The HCP structure has the 12-fold prismatic dihedral symmetry of the point group &quot;D3h&quot;. A complete list of symmetry properties of a point group can be found in point group character tables.

In general it is easier to calculate a DOS when the symmetry of the system is higher and the number of topological dimensions of the dispersion relation is lower. The DOS of dispersion relations with rotational symmetry can often be calculated analytically. This result is fortunate, since many materials of practical interest, such as steel and silicon, have high symmetry.

In anisotropic condensed matter systems such as a single crystal of a compound, the density of states could be different in one crystallographic direction than in another. These causes the anisotropic density of states to be more difficult to visualize, and might require methods such as calculating the DOS for particular points or directions only, or calculating the projected density of states (PDOS) to a particular crystal orientation.

==&quot;k&quot;-space topologies==

The density of states is dependent upon the dimensional limits of the object itself. In a system described by three orthogonal parameters (3 Dimension), the units of DOS is in a two dimensional system, the units of DOS is in a one dimensional system, the units of DOS is The referenced volume is the volume of -space; the space enclosed by the constant energy surface of the system derived through a dispersion relation that relates to . An example of a 3-dimensional -space is given in Fig. 1. It can be seen that the dimensionality of the system confines the momentum of particles inside the system.

===Density of wave vector states (sphere)===
The calculation for DOS starts by counting the allowed states at a certain that are contained within inside the volume of the system. This procedure is done by differentiating the whole k-space volume formula_19 in n-dimensions at an arbitrary , with respect to . The volume, area or length in 3, 2 or 1-dimensional spherical -spaces are expressed by
formula_20

for a -dimensional -space with the topologically determined constants
formula_21
for linear, disk and spherical symmetrical shaped functions in 1, 2 and 3-dimensional Euclidean -spaces respectively.

According to this scheme, the density of wave vector states is, through differentiating formula_22 with respect to , expressed by
formula_23

The 1, 2 and 3-dimensional density of wave vector states for a line, disk, or sphere are explicitly written as
formula_24

One state is large enough to contain particles having wavelength λ. The wavelength is related to through the relationship.
formula_25

In a quantum system the length of λ will depend on a characteristic spacing of the system L that is confining the particles. Finally the density of states &quot;N&quot; is multiplied by a factor formula_26, where is a constant degeneracy factor that accounts for internal degrees of freedom due to such physical phenomena as spin or polarization. If no such phenomenon is present then formula_27. &quot;Vk&quot; is the volume in k-space whose wavevectors are smaller than the smallest possible wavevectors decided by the characteristic spacing of the system.

===Density of energy states===
To finish the calculation for DOS find the number of states per unit sample volume at an energy formula_3 inside an interval formula_29. The general form of DOS of a system is given as
formula_30
The scheme sketched so far &quot;only&quot; applies to &quot;monotonically rising&quot; and &quot;spherically symmetric&quot; dispersion relations. In general the dispersion relation formula_31 is not spherically symmetric and in many cases it isn&#x27;t continuously rising either. To express &quot;D&quot; as a function of &quot;E&quot; the inverse of the dispersion relation formula_31 has to be substituted into the expression of formula_33 as a function of &quot;k&quot; to get the expression of formula_34 as a function of the energy. If the dispersion relation is not spherically symmetric or continuously rising and can&#x27;t be inverted easily then in most cases the DOS has to be calculated numerically. More detailed derivations are available.

==Dispersion relations==
The dispersion relation for electrons in a solid is given by the electronic band structure.
The kinetic energy of a particle depends on the magnitude and direction of the wave vector &quot;k&quot;, the properties of the particle and the environment in which the particle is moving. For example, the kinetic energy of an electron in a Fermi gas is given by
formula_35

where &quot;m&quot; is the electron mass. The dispersion relation is a spherically symmetric parabola and it is continuously rising so the DOS can be calculated easily.
For longitudinal phonons in a string of atoms the dispersion relation of the kinetic energy in a 1-dimensional &quot;k&quot;-space, as shown in Figure 2, is given by
formula_36
where formula_37 is the oscillator frequency, formula_38 the mass of the atoms, formula_39 the inter-atomic force constant and formula_40 inter-atomic spacing. For small values of formula_41 the dispersion relation is linear:
formula_42

When formula_43 the energy is
formula_44

With the transformation formula_45 and small formula_46 this relation can be transformed to 
formula_47

===Isotropic dispersion relations===
The two examples mentioned here can be expressed like
formula_48

This expression is a kind of dispersion relation because it interrelates two wave properties and it is isotropic because only the length and not the direction of the wave vector appears in the expression. The magnitude of the wave vector is related to the energy as:
formula_49

Accordingly, the volume of n-dimensional -space containing wave vectors smaller than is:
formula_20

Substitution of the isotropic energy relation gives the volume of occupied states
formula_51

Differentiating this volume with respect to the energy gives an expression for the DOS of the isotropic dispersion relation
formula_52

===Parabolic dispersion===

In the case of a parabolic dispersion relation (&quot;p&quot; = 2), such as applies to free electrons in a Fermi gas, the resulting density of states, formula_53, for electrons in a n-dimensional systems is

formula_54

for formula_55, with formula_56 for formula_57.

In 1-dimensional systems the DOS diverges at the bottom of the band as formula_3 drops to formula_59. In 2-dimensional systems the DOS turns out to be independent of formula_3. Finally for 3-dimensional systems the DOS rises as the square root of the energy.

Including the prefactor formula_26, the expression for the 3D DOS is
formula_62
where formula_2 is the total volume, and formula_64 includes the 2-fold spin degeneracy.

===Linear dispersion===
In the case of a linear relation (&quot;p&quot; = 1), such as applies to photons, acoustic phonons, or to some special kinds of electronic bands in a solid, the DOS in 1, 2 and 3 dimensional systems is related to the energy as:

formula_65

==Distribution functions==

The density of states plays an important role in the kinetic theory of solids. The product of the density of states and the probability distribution function is the number of occupied states per unit volume at a given energy for a system in thermal equilibrium. This value is widely used to investigate various physical properties of matter. The following are examples, using two common distribution functions, of how applying a distribution function to the density of states can give rise to physical properties.

Fermi–Dirac statistics: The Fermi–Dirac probability distribution function, Fig. 4, is used to find the probability that a fermion occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. Fermions are particles which obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. electrons, protons, neutrons). The distribution function can be written as
formula_66
formula_67 is the chemical potential (also denoted as EF and called the Fermi level when &quot;T&quot;=0), formula_68 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_69 is temperature. Fig. 4 illustrates how the product of the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the three-dimensional density of states for a semiconductor can give insight to physical properties such as carrier concentration and Energy band gaps.

Bose–Einstein statistics: The Bose–Einstein probability distribution function is used to find the probability that a boson occupies a specific quantum state in a system at thermal equilibrium. Bosons are particles which do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (e.g. phonons and photons). The distribution function can be written as
formula_70

From these two distributions it is possible to calculate properties such as the internal energy per unit volume formula_71, the number of particles formula_72, specific heat capacity formula_73, and thermal conductivity formula_6. The relationships between these properties and the product of the density of states and the probability distribution, denoting the density of states by formula_75 instead of formula_76, are given by
formula_77

formula_7 is dimensionality, formula_79 is sound velocity and formula_80 is mean free path.

==Applications==
The density of states appears in many areas of physics, and helps to explain a number of quantum mechanical phenomena.

===Quantization===

Calculating the density of states for small structures shows that the distribution of electrons changes as dimensionality is reduced. For quantum wires, the DOS for certain energies actually becomes higher than the DOS for bulk semiconductors, and for quantum dots the electrons become quantized to certain energies.

===Photonic crystals===
The photon density of states can be manipulated by using periodic structures with length scales on the order of the wavelength of light. Some structures can completely inhibit the propagation of light of certain colors (energies), creating a photonic band gap: the DOS is zero for those photon energies. Other structures can inhibit the propagation of light only in certain directions to create mirrors, waveguides, and cavities. Such periodic structures are known as photonic crystals. In nanostructured media the concept of local density of states (LDOS) is often more relevant than that of DOS, as the DOS varies considerably from point to point.

==Computational calculation ==
Interesting systems are in general complex, for instance compounds, biomolecules, polymers, etc. Because of the complexity of these systems the analytical calculation of the density of states is in most of the cases impossible. Computer simulations offer a set of algorithms to evaluate the density of states with a high accuracy. One of these algorithms is called the Wang and Landau algorithm.

Within the Wang and Landau scheme any previous knowledge of the density of states is required. One proceeds as follows: the cost function (for example the energy) of the system is discretized. Each time the bin &quot;i&quot; is reached one updates a histogram for the density of states, formula_81, by
formula_82
where is called the modification factor. As soon as each bin in the histogram is visited a certain number of times (10-15), the modification factor is reduced by some criterion, for instance,
formula_83
where denotes the -th update step. The simulation finishes when the modification factor is less than a certain threshold, for instance 

The Wang and Landau algorithm has some advantages over other common algorithms such as multicanonical simulations and parallel tempering. For example, the density of states is obtained as the main product of the simulation. Additionally, Wang and Landau simulations are completely independent of the temperature. This feature allows to compute the density of states of systems with very rough energy landscape such as proteins.

Mathematically the density of states is formulated in terms of a tower of covering maps.

==Local density of states==
An important feature of the definition of the DOS is that it can be extended to any system. One of its properties are the translationally invariability which means that the density of the states is homogeneous and it&#x27;s the same at each point of the system. But this is just a particular case and the LDOS gives a wider description with a heterogeneous density of states through the system.

===Concept===
Local density of states (LDOS) describes a space-resolved density of states. In materials science, for example, this term is useful when interpreting the data from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), since this method is capable of imaging electron densities of states with atomic resolution. According to crystal structure, this quantity can be predicted by computational methods, as for example with density functional theory.

=== A general definition ===
In a local density of states the contribution of each state is weighted by the density of its wave function at the point. formula_84 becomes formula_85

formula_86

the factor of formula_87 means that each state contributes more in the regions where the density is high. An average over formula_88 of this expression will restore the usual formula for a DOS. The LDOS is useful in inhomogeneous systems, where formula_85 contains more information than formula_90 alone.

For a one-dimensional system with a wall, the sine waves give

formula_91

where formula_92.

In a three-dimensional system with formula_93 the expression is

formula_94

In fact, we can generalise the local density of states further to

formula_95

this is called the &quot;spectral function&quot; and it&#x27;s a function with each wave function separately in its own variable. In more advanced theory it is connected with the Green&#x27;s functions and provides a compact representation of some results such as optical absorption.

===Solid state devices===
LDOS can be used to gain profit into a solid-state device. For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a transistor as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of band edge. In the channel, the DOS is increasing as gate voltage increase and potential barrier goes down.

===Optics and photonics===

In optics and photonics, the concept of local density of states refers to the states that can be occupied by a photon. For light it is usually measured by fluorescence methods, near-field scanning methods or by cathodoluminescence techniques. Different photonic structures have different LDOS behaviors with different consequences for spontaneous emission. In photonic crystals, near-zero LDOS are expected, inhibiting spontaneous emission.
Similar LDOS enhancement is also expected in plasmonic cavity.
However, in disordered photonic nanostructures, the LDOS behave differently. They fluctuate spatially with their statistics, and are proportional to the scattering strength of the structures.
In addition, the relationship with the mean free path of the scattering is trivial as the LDOS can be still strongly influenced by the short details of strong disorders in the form of a strong Purcell enhancement of the emission. and finally, for the plasmonic disorder, this effect is much stronger for LDOS fluctuations as it can be observed as a strong near-field localization.

<text>The price elasticity of supply (PES or Es) is commonly known as “a measure used in economics to show the responsiveness, or elasticity, of the quantity supplied of a good or service to a change in its price.” Price elasticity of supply, in application, is the percentage change of the quantity supplied resulting from a 1% change in price. Alternatively, PES is the percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.

When PES is less than one, the supply of the good can be described as &quot;inelastic.&quot; When price elasticity of supply is greater than one, the supply can be described as &quot;elastic&quot;. An elasticity of zero indicates that quantity supplied does not respond to a price change: the good is &quot;fixed&quot; in supply. Such goods often have no labor component or are not produced, limiting the short run prospects of expansion. If the elasticity is exactly one, the good is said to be &quot;unit-elastic&quot;. Differing from price elasticity of demand, price elasticities of supply are generally positive numbers because an increase in the price of a good motivates producers to produce more, as relative marginal revenue increases.

The quantity of goods supplied can, in the short term, be different from the amount produced, as manufacturers will have stocks which they can build up or run down.

== Definition &amp; Real-Life Example ==
The slope of a supply curve relates changes in price to changes in quantity supplied. A steeper curve means that price changes are correlated with relatively small quantity changes. Steep supply curves derive that the quantity supplied by producers are not particularly sensitive to price changes. Oppositely, flatter supply curves imply that price changes are associated with large quantity changes. Markets with flat supply curves will see large movements in quantity supplied as prices change.

The concept of elasticity expresses the responsiveness of a value to changes in another (particularly, responsiveness of quantities to prices). An elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in one value to the percentage change in another. The concept of elasticity applies to demand and supply curves and agents like producers and consumers.
formula_1
Suppose that there is an increase in demand for apartments. There will be a shortage of apartments at the old level of apartment rents and pressure on rents (price) to increase. Ceteris paribus, the more responsive (elastic) the quantity of apartments supplied is to changes in monthly rents, the lower the increase in rent required to eliminate the shortage and to bring the market back to equilibrium. Conversely, if quantity supplied is less responsive (inelastic) to price changes, price will have to increase more to eliminate a shortage caused by an increase in demand.

==Determinants==
;Availability of raw materials: For example, availability may cap the amount of gold that can be produced in a country regardless of price. Likewise, the price of Van Gogh paintings is unlikely to affect their supply.

;Length and complexity of production: Much depends on the complexity of the production process. Textile production is relatively simple. The labour is largely unskilled and production facilities are little more than buildings – no special structures are needed. Thus the PES for textiles is elastic. 

;Mobility of factors: If the factors of production are easily available and if a producer producing one good can switch their resources and put it towards the creation of a product in demand, then it can be said that the PES is relatively elastic. The inverse applies to this, to make it relatively inelastic.

;Time to respond: The more time a producer has to respond to price changes the more elastic the supply. Supply is normally more elastic in the long run than in the short run for produced goods, since it is generally assumed that in the long run all factors of production can be utilised to increase supply, whereas in the short run only labor can be increased, and even then, changes may be prohibitively costly. For example, a cotton farmer cannot immediately (i.e. in the short run) respond to an increase in the price of soybeans because of the time it would take to procure the necessary land.

;Inventories: A producer who has a supply of goods or available storage capacity can quickly increase supply to market.

;Spare or excess production capacity: A producer who has unused capacity can (and will) quickly respond to price changes in his market assuming that variable factors are readily available. The existence of spare capacity within a firm, would be indicative of more proportionate response in quantity supplied to changes in price (hence suggesting price elasticity). It indicates that the producer would be able to utilise spare factor markets (factors of production) at its disposal and hence respond to changes in demand to match with supply. The greater the extent of spare production capacity, the quicker suppliers can respond to price changes and hence the more price elastic the good/service would be.

== Elasticity versus slope ==
The elasticity of supply will generally vary along the curve, even if supply is linear so the slope is constant. This is because the slope measures the absolute increase in quantity for an absolute increase in price, but the elasticity measures the percentage change. This also means that the slope depends on the units of measurement and will change if the units change (e.g., dollars per pound versus dollars per ounce) while the elasticity is a simple number, independent of the units (e.g., 1.2). This is a major advantage of elasticities. 

The slope of the supply curve is &quot;dP/dQ&quot;, while the elasticity is &quot;(dQ/dP)(P/Q)&quot;. Thus, a supply curve with steeper slope (bigger &quot;dP/dQ&quot; and thus smaller &quot;dQ/dP&quot;) is less elastic, for given &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;. Along a linear supply curve such as &quot;Q = a + b P&quot; the slope is constant (at &quot;1/b&quot;) but the elasticity is &quot;b(P/Q)&quot;, so the elasticity rises with greater &quot;P&quot; both from the direct effect and the increase in &quot;Q(P)&quot;. 

Another special feature of the linear supply curve arises because its elasticity can also be written as bP/(a + bP), which is less than 1 if &quot;a &lt; 0&quot; and greater than 1 if &quot;a &gt; 0&quot;. Linear supply curves which cut through the positive part of the price axis and have zero quantity supplied if the price is too low (&quot;P &lt; -a/&quot;b) have &quot;a &lt; 0&quot; and hence they always have elastic supply. Curves which cut through the positive part of the quantity axis and have positive quantity supplied (&quot;Q = a&quot;) even if the price is zero have &quot;a &gt; 0&quot; and hence always have inelastic supply. Curves which go through the origin have &quot;a = 0&quot; and hence have an elasticity of 1.
When looking at the price elasticity of supply, there are five types. The five types are perfectly inelastic supply, relatively inelastic supply, unit elastic supply, relatively elastic supply, and perfectly elastic supply. These five types help to show how different products supply quantity changes when faced with changed in price.

Perfectly inelastic supply: This is when the Es formula equals to zero, meaning that there is no change in the supply when there are price changes. This can be the case where there is a limited quantity of supply, for example, if there is only 200 of a certain product made and there will never be any more made, there will be no increase or decrease in the quantity of supply.

Relatively inelastic supply: This is when the Es formula gives a result between zero and one, meaning that when there is a change in price, the percentage change in supply is lower than the percentage change in price. For example, if a product costs $1 and then increases to $1.10 the increase in price is 10% and therefore the change in supply will be less than 10%.

Unit Elastic supply: This is when the Es formula equals to one, meaning that quantity supplied and price change by the same percentage. Using the previous example to show unit elasticity, when there is a 10% increase in price, there will also be a 10% increase in quantity supplied.

Relatively elastic supply: This is when the Es formula gives a result above one, meaning that when there is a change in price, the percentage change in supply is higher than the percentage change in price. Using the above example to show an elastic supply, when there is a 10% increase in price there will be more than a 10% increase in supply.

Perfectly elastic supply: This is when the Es formula actually gives an infinite result, meaning that the quantity that can be supplied is infinite, however, that is only at a specific price and if the price changes there will be no quantity supplied at all. For example, there may be an infinite supply of product at a price of $1 but if that price changes to $1.10 then the supply becomes zero.

==Short-run and long-run==
Since firms typically have a limited capacity for production, the elasticity of supply tends to be high at low levels of quantity supplied and low at high levels of quantity supplied. At low levels of quantity supplied, firms typically have substantial capacity available for use, so small increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin to use this idle capacity. Thus, the responsiveness of quantity supplied to changes in price is high in this region of the supply curve. However, as capacity becomes fully utilised, increasing production requires additional investment in capital (for example, plant and equipment). Since the price must rise substantially to cover this additional expense, supply becomes less elastic at high levels of output.

<text>Railway preservation in New Zealand is the preservation of historically significant facets of New Zealand&#x27;s rail transport history. The earliest recorded preservation attempt took place in 1925, although the movement itself did not start properly until 1960.

==History==

===Early initiatives===
Early preservation efforts in New Zealand were restricted to static public display of locomotives, and it is believed the first was Double Fairlie E class locomotive E 175 &quot;Josephine&quot; outside the Dunedin Railway Station in 1925. After this, the preservation movement entered a hiatus until the founding of the New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society in 1944, which established branches throughout the country. The first act of active railway preservation was started by the NZR&amp;LS Otago Branch when they purchased a small 9-tonne Fowler 0-4-0T tank locomotive built in 1921 and formerly used by the Public Works Department as their NO 540, from the Otago Harbour Board for use on the fledgeling Ocean Beach Railway, established in 1963.

Similar works were soon started in Christchurch by the NZR&amp;LS Canterbury Branch at their new Ferrymead Railway in Christchurch, the NZR&amp;LS Auckland Branch at their Glenbrook Vintage Railway and the NZR&amp;LS Wellington Branch at their Silver Stream Railway. A railway museum was established at Te Awamutu by the NZR&amp;LS Waikato Branch. However, this period also saw the breakaway of the NZR&amp;LS Auckland and Canterbury Branches to become the Railway Enthusiasts Society and the Canterbury Railway Society respectively, although they retained an affiliation with the NZR&amp;LS.

===1960 to 1985===
During the period from 1960 to 1979, the rail preservation scene began to increase as more railway museums and groups were established, helped in part by the closure of rural branch lines by New Zealand Railways. In this category, railway museum groups were set up by the Pleasant Point Museum and Railway at Pleasant Point and the Ashburton Railway and Preservation Society at Tinwald Domain near Ashburton in Canterbury. These groups at the time were attempting to save part of the fabric of rural branch lines that had been operated by New Zealand Railways but were being closed down.

As the replacement of steam was accelerated during this period and was completed in 1971, other groups were initiated to preserve the mainline locomotives and rolling stock of NZR. The first group to do so was Steam Incorporated, based out of the former Paekakariki locomotive depot site just north of Wellington. The Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland also began to accept railway vehicles for preservation, in conjunction with the Bush Tramway Club which was preserving former industrial locomotives used on the bush tramways of New Zealand.

Following the end of steam in 1971, NZR placed a total steam ban on the national network, with the exception of its own heritage operation, the famous Kingston Flyer which began operation between Lumsden and Kingston on the Kingston Branch in that year. This ban required that if steam locomotives were to operate in New Zealand, they would be confined to either heritage railways, museums, or private sites. During this time, the majority of groups established began to expand their operations as NZR progressively modernised, and in some cases were able to extend their running lines or establish museum-type displays to showcase their rolling stock.

In 1977 the National Federation of Railway Societies was formed to provide a cohesive network between the different groups. This group would work as a coordinator and organiser in later years between different groups.

This period also saw the birth of the Otago Excursion Train Trust, founded in 1978 to run excursion trains over the scenic Otago Central Railway. Initially, these trains were run with NZR carriages and locomotives but later the OETT purchased its own fleet of carriages from NZR which were refurbished by Government apprentices and volunteers, first at Burnside railway station and later in the north yard at Dunedin railway station. This group was joined by Steam Incorporated and the Railway Enthusiasts Society in running similar excursions using NZR diesel locomotives but the organising group&#x27;s own carriages.

In 1985, NZR agreed to remove the steam ban in conjunction with the centenary of the start of construction of the North Island Main Trunk. A steam excursion was run from Wellington to Auckland, using Steam Incorporated&#x27;s KA 945 and the RES&#x27; JA 1250 to haul the train of mixed Steam Inc and RES stock. As NZR still used red as the colour for its coaching stock, these groups used their own liveries, predominantly brown or yellow.

===1985 to 2000===
Although the pace of preservation slowed into the early 1980s and beyond, several more groups were established to preserve longer branch lines as well as the more traditional museum-focused operation. The Weka Pass Railway in North Canterbury, the Bay of Islands Vintage Railway in Northland, the Otago-based Dunedin Railways, and the Goldfields Steam Train Society in the Bay of Plenty were all founded during the early 1980s using stock retired by NZR. In the case of Dunedin Railways (formerly known as Taieri Gorge Railway Limited), it was created by the OETT and the Dunedin City Council to preserve the 64-kilometre section of the Otago Central railway between Middlemarch and Wingatui through the Taieri Gorge for passenger operations after the New Zealand Railways Corporation closed the line in 1990.

In 1988, numerous preservation groups contributed to the Ferrymead 125 celebrations in Christchurch to mark 125 years since the first public railway opened in New Zealand.

With the retirement of the first-generation diesel locomotives, the Diesel Traction Group was founded in Christchurch in 1983 with an aim to preserve these locomotives. By 1990 this group had four locomotives at their Ferrymead base, all of which were built by English Electric. Other groups and individuals started to acquire other first-generation diesel locomotives to add to their fleet, such as Steam Incorporated&#x27;s two DA class diesel locomotives which were purchased in 1988. Other individuals also purchased similar locomotives for preservation and based them at established heritage sites. NZR also selected numerous diesel and electric locomotives, along with two carriages, for inclusion in their own Heritage Fleet.

During this time, Ian Welch&#x27;s Mainline Steam Trust emerged as a heritage operator with its fleet of preserved ex-NZR steam locomotives. This period also witnessed the creation of other groups such as the Oamaru District Steam &amp; Rail Society, the Grand Tapawera Railroad Company/Nelson Railway Society, the narrow-gauge Blenheim Riverside Railway, and special interest groups such as the Pahiatua Railcar Society. Some groups, such as the Gisborne City Vintage Railway and the Feilding and District Steam Rail Society were formed to preserve a specific locomotive, in this case WA 165 at Gisborne and the NZR&amp;LS&#x27; WAB 794 at Ferrymead.

Very few new groups emerged from 1990 to 2000. NZR&#x27;s successor, Tranz Rail, did give further rolling stock to heritage groups, although a shortage of stock did see some of this recalled temporarily, while heritage diesel locomotives were leased from a private individual to alleviate the reduced number of locomotives. During this time, the NFRS became the Federation of Rail Organisations of New Zealand (FRONZ) to reflect its railway and tramway group members. In 1991 the Rail Heritage Trust of New Zealand was formed with former NZR executive Euan McQueen as its chair, to preserve former NZR buildings and rolling stock, which was leased to other groups. The Rail Heritage trust pioneered the concept of &quot;heritage rolling stock&quot; which was leased to various preservation groups around New Zealand by Tranz Rail. Over 200 such items of rolling stock are now leased.

===Current projects===
The most ambitious heritage project to date is the Rimutaka Incline Railway, which proposes to construct from scratch a railway line over an existing historic formation abandoned in 1955. This is the route of the former Rimutaka railway and Rimutaka Incline over a distance of some 20 km, including 5 km of the 1 in 15 incline worked by the Fell centre-rail system. Although the Taieri Gorge Railway in Dunedin is a much longer and successful heritage railway at 60 km length, it has the advantage that all its track was still in place when it was set up in 1990. The Rimutaka proposal faces many obstacles from the construction of new track and formation rehabilitation works, to the building of new locomotives of the Fell type. The project is in the planning stages and it will be some years before any construction starts.

Another ambitious project is currently being undertaken by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Trust, which has recovered the remains of WMR No. 9/NZR N 453 and aims to restore it to full operational condition. Although four ex-WMR coaches and a small number of wagons have survived into preservation, it was believed for many years that no Wellington and Manawatu Railway locomotives were still extant. However, the remains of WMR NO 9 (N 453) were found at Bealey on the Midland Line, and in 2003 the locomotive&#x27;s frames were retrieved, followed by the tender tank, underframe, and bogie frames in 2005.

The WMR Trust ultimately seek to restore NO 9 to working order, and operate this locomotive on the main line. This locomotive will be paired with a replica of a WMR goods wagon to act as a support wagon on the main line.

<doc id="525901" wikidata="Q380026" url="?curid=525901" title="Antanas Mockus">
<text>Aurelijus Rūtenis Antanas Mockus Šivickas (; born 25 March 1952) is a Colombian mathematician, philosopher, and politician. He has a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy from the National University of Colombia, and a Honoris Causa PhD from the University of Paris.

He is the son of Lithuanian immigrants. He left office as the president of the National University of Colombia in Bogotá in 1993, and later that year ran a successful campaign for mayor. He proceeded to preside over Bogotá as mayor for two (non-consecutive) terms, during which he became known for springing surprising and humorous initiatives upon the city&#x27;s inhabitants. These tended to involve grand gestures, including local artists or personal appearances by the mayor himself—taking a shower in a commercial about conserving water, or walking the streets dressed in spandex and a cape as Supercitizen. On 4 March 2010, he was elected in a public consultation as the Colombian Green Party candidate for the presidential election in 2010.

On 4 April 2010, Antanas Mockus chose Sergio Fajardo, former mayor of Medellín, as his vice-presidential running mate. On 9 April 2010 he announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He told La W radio: &quot;The prediction is that this will not affect my mental activities. I think it is absolutely fitting to tell the people about the diagnosis and about the prognosis—which is 12 years or more of normal life thanks to medication.&quot; Mockus finished second in the polling, leading to a runoff election with Juan Manuel Santos, which Santos won. Mockus resigned from the Green Party in June 2011 because he opposed its Bogotá mayoral candidate being supported by former right-wing President Álvaro Uribe.

He became Senator of the Republic of Colombia in July 2018, after being the second candidate with the most votes in the legislative elections held on March 11, 2018. He is also the president of the Corporación Visionarios por Colombia (Corpovisionarios), center of thought and non-profit action that investigates, advises, designs and implements actions to achieve voluntary changes in collective behavior.

==Early life and career==
Mockus was born in Bogotá. He holds a 1972 Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France and a 1988 Master of Arts degree in philosophy from the National University of Colombia. He has been a professor and researcher at the university since 1975 and has served as its vice president (1988–1991) and president (1991–1993). As its president, he contributed to the formulation of the Colombian Constitution of 1991, focusing on educational issues. In a notable 1993 incident, when confronted with a disruptive group of students, he mooned them. He later explained his action by saying &quot;Innovative behavior can be useful when you run out of words&quot;, and linked it to philosopher Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s concept of &quot;symbolic violence.&quot; He resigned as University president during the aftermath but gained a higher public profile that benefited his subsequent run for the mayorship.

==Bogotá mayorship==
In 1995, he was elected Mayor of Bogotá. Under Mockus&#x27;s leadership, Bogotá saw improvements such as: water usage dropped 40%, 7,000 community security groups were formed and the homicide rate fell 70%, traffic fatalities dropped by over 50%, drinking water was provided to all homes (up from 79% in 1993), and sewerage was provided to 95% of homes (up from 71%). When he asked residents to pay a voluntary extra 10% in taxes, 63,000 people did so. His market-oriented social policies were much less successful. Poverty and unemployment levels were high throughout his tenures and continue to be a pressing issue in Bogotá&#x27;s social life.
Famous initiatives included hiring 420 mimes to make fun of traffic violators, because he believed Colombians were more afraid of being ridiculed than fined. He also put in place one &quot;Night Without Men&quot;, on which the city&#x27;s men were asked to stay home for an evening to look after the house and the children while the women went out. The city sponsored free open-air concerts, bars offered women-only specials, Ciclovia and the city&#x27;s women police were in charge of keeping the peace. Amassing political support mainly from Bogotá&#x27;s middle and upper classes, he has been much less successful attracting voters in the national level.

During Mockus&#x27; unsuccessful presidential bid in 1998, Enrique Peñalosa replaced him as mayor. Peñalosa worked in a similar way instituting popular new bike paths and bus systems. When Mockus ran again for the 2001 mayorship, he held a ceremony in a public fountain &quot;to ask forgiveness for leaving the mayor&#x27;s office in an unsuccessful bid for the presidency.&quot; The impact of Mockus and Peñalosa on the development of Bogotá is described in a documentary film released in October 2009 with the title CITIES ON SPEED – Bogotá Change.

In 2003, Mockus stepped down as mayor, to be replaced by Luis Eduardo Garzón, and took a year&#x27;s sabbatical, traveling and speaking around the world. He planned to return to teaching at National University of Colombia the following year, although he said he was &quot;considering the possibility of launching a presidential campaign&quot;. After spending two weeks as a visiting fellow at the Harvard&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government in the United States in 2004, &quot;to share lessons about civic engagement with students and faculty&quot;, Mockus returned to Harvard as a Visiting Professor of Romance Languages and Literatures to teach two Spanish classes during the Fall 2004–2005 semester. In November, Mockus made a special trip to the University of Virginia to speak about the use of positive social mechanisms in relation to his tenure as the mayor of Bogotá.

In 2004, Lithuanian worldwide daily &quot;Draugas&quot; chose Mockus as &quot;Lithuanian of the Year&quot;. In October 2004 he visited the Lithuanian community in Chicago, which is the biggest Lithuanian community outside of Lithuania, and delivered a speech in his native Lithuanian language. He is the president of Corpovisionarios, an organization that consults to cities about addressing their problems through the same policy methodology that was so successful during his terms as Mayor of Bogotá.

==Presidential bids==

In between his two terms as mayor, Mockus ran an unsuccessful 1998 bid for the presidency, first in his own name and later as Noemí Sanín Posada&#x27;s running mate. Mockus ran in the 2006 presidential election as a member of the Indigenous Social Alliance Movement. He finished fourth in the election, attracting 1.24% of the vote.

In August 2009, Mockus and two other past mayors of Bogotá (Enrique Peñalosa and Luis Eduardo Garzón) joined a new political movement, Colombian Green Party and decided that one of them would run for office in the 2010 Colombian presidential elections. Mockus, Peñalosa and Garzón embarked on an innovative campaign, in which they acknowledged and honored each other&#x27;s qualifications and preparedness for the job, and telling people to choose whomever they liked best. Through a popular consultation carried on 14 March 2010, which he won by a large margin, Mockus became the Colombian Green Party presidential candidate.
On 4 April 2010, Antanas Mockus chose Medellín&#x27;s former mayor Sergio Fajardo as his running mate, unifying two groups at the center of the political spectrum. Mockus finished second in the first round of voting, with 21.5% of the vote, qualifying him to participate in a runoff election with Juan Manuel Santos, which Mockus lost decisively with 27.5% of the vote.

Antanas Mockus left the Green Party in 2011.

<text>Bunratty Castle () is a large 15th-century tower house in County Clare, Ireland. It is located in the centre of Bunratty village, by the N18 road between Limerick and Ennis, near Shannon Town and its airport. The castle and the adjoining folk park are run by Shannon Heritage as tourist attractions.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bunratty&quot; means &quot;mouth of the Ratty River&quot; in Irish. This is another name for the Owenogarney River, which empties into the Shannon Estuary after flowing past the village and castle. 

==Earlier structures==

The first recorded settlement at the site may have been a Norse trading camp reported in the Annals of the Four Masters to have been destroyed by Brian Boru in 977. According to local tradition, such a camp was located on a rise southwest of the current castle. Since no remains of this settlement have been found, its exact location is unknown and its existence is not proven.

Around 1250, King Henry III of England granted the cantred or district of Tradraighe (or Tradree) to Robert De Muscegros, who in 1251 cut down around 200 trees in the King&#x27;s wood at Cratloe. These may have been used to construct a &quot;motte and bailey&quot; castle, which would have been the first castle at Bunratty, but again the exact position of this is unknown. A later reference in the state papers, dating to 1253 gives de Muscegros the right to hold markets and an annual fair at Bunratty. It has thus been assumed that the site was the centre of early Norman control in south-eastern Clare. Early 19th-century scholars put the structure to the north-west of the current castle. When a hotel was constructed there in 1959, John Hunt excavated the area and thought the remains to be that of a gun emplacement from the Confederate Wars (see below). This river, alongside the castle, flows into the nearby Shannon estuary.

These lands were later handed back to (or taken back by) King Henry III and granted to Thomas De Clare, a descendant of Strongbow in 1276. De Clare built the first stone structure on the site (the second castle). This castle was occupied from ca. 1278 to 1318 and consisted of a large single stone tower with lime white walls. It stood close to the river, on or near the site of the present Bunratty Castle. In the late 13th century, Bunratty had about 1,000 inhabitants. The castle was attacked several times by the O&#x27;Briens (or O&#x27;Brians) and their allies. In 1284, while De Clare was away in England, the site was captured and destroyed. On his return, in 1287, De Clare had the site rebuilt and a long fosse built around it. The castle was again attacked but it did not fall until 1318. In that year a major battle was fought at Dysert O&#x27;Dea as part of the Irish Bruce Wars, in which Richard de Clare was killed. Lady De Clare, on learning this, fled from Bunratty to Limerick after burning castle and town. The De Clare family never returned to the area and the remains of the castle eventually collapsed. As the stones were probably used for other local construction works, no traces remain of this second castle.

In the 14th century, Limerick was an important port for the English Crown. To guard access via the Shannon estuary against attacks from the Irish, the site was once again occupied. In 1353, Sir Thomas de Rokeby led an English army to conquer the MacNamaras and MacCarthys. A new castle (the third) was built at Bunratty, but once again, its exact location is unknown. Local tradition holds that it stood at the site where the Bunratty Castle Hotel was later constructed. The new structure was hardly finished before it was captured by the Irish. Documents show that in 1355, King Edward III of England released Thomas Fitzjohn Fitzmaurice from prison in Limerick. He had been charged with letting the castle fall into the hands of Murtough O’Brien whilst serving as a Governor (Captain) of Bunratty.

==Current structure==
Building of the fourth castle, the present structure, started around 1450. Its builder may have been one Maccon Sioda MacNamara, chieftain of Clann Cuilein (i.e. the MacNamaras). He died before the castle was completed which happened under his son Sean Finn (died in 1467). At around 1500, Bunratty Castle came into the hands of the O&#x27;Briens (or O&#x27;Brians), the most powerful clan in Munster and later Earls of Thomond. They expanded the site and eventually made it their chief seat, moving it there from Ennis.

In 1558, the castle—now noted as one of the principal strongholds of Thomond—was taken by Thomas Radclyffe, the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from Donal O&#x27;Brien of Duagh, last King of Thomond (died 1579), and given to Donal&#x27;s nephew, Connor O&#x27;Brien. Donogh O&#x27;Brien, Conor&#x27;s son, may have been the one to move the seat of the family from Clonroad (Ennis) to Bunratty. He made various improvements to the castle including putting a new lead roof on it.

During the Confederate Wars set off by the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Lord Forbes, commanding forces of the English Long Parliament, was allowed by the then Lord Barnabas O&#x27;Brien to occupy Bunratty in 1646. Barnabas did not want to commit to either side in the struggle, playing off royalists, rebels and roundheads against each other. He left for England, where he joined King Charles. Defence of the castle, whose position allowed those holding it to blockade maritime access to Limerick (held by the Confederates) and the river Shannon, was in the hands of Rear-Admiral Penn, the father of William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. After a long siege, the Confederates took the castle. Penn surrendered but was allowed to sail away to Kinsale.

Barnabas O&#x27;Brien died in 1657, but had apparently leased out the castle to one &quot;John Cooper&quot;, likely the same person married to Máire ní Mahon of Leamaneh Castle, widow of another O&#x27;Brien, Conor (died 1651). Bunratty Castle remained property of the O&#x27;Briens and in the 1680s the castle was still the principal seat of the Earls of Thomond. In 1712, Henry, the 8th and last Earl of Thomond (1688–1741) sold Bunratty Castle and of land to Thomas Amory for £225 and an annual rent of £120. Amory in turn sold the castle to Thomas Studdert who moved in ca. 1720.

The Studdert family left the castle (allowing it to fall into disrepair), to reside in the more comfortable and modern adjacent &quot;Bunratty House&quot; they had built in 1804.

For some time in the mid-19th century, the castle was used as a barracks by the Royal Irish Constabulary. In 1894, Bunratty was once again used by the Studdert family, as the seat of Captain Richard Studdert. In the late 19th century, the roof of the Great Hall collapsed.

In 1956, the castle was purchased and restored by the 7th Viscount Gort, with assistance from the Office of Public Works. He reroofed the castle and saved it from ruin. The castle was opened to the public in 1960, with sporting furniture, tapestries and works of art dating to around the 1600&#x27;s.

In February 1984, Pat Nugent was discovered in the reception area of the castle, mortally wounded. In 2024 a renewed investigation into his death was opened by An Garda Siochana.

In 2023 the ownership of the castle was transferred, with the transfer of Shannon Heritage DAC, a division of Shannon Group, to Clare County Council. This was part of larger transfer of the tourism sites that the company formerly operated, including the transfer of the nearby King John&#x27;s Castle to Limerick City Council, owing to losses sustained at the sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other sites included in the transfer to Clare County Council were Craggaunowen Bronze Age Park, Knappogue Castle &amp; Walled Garden, and a retail unit operated by Shannon Heritage at the Cliffs of Moher.

<text>Adi Kuini Teimumu Vuikaba Speed (23 December 1949 – 31 December 2004) was a Fijian chief and politician, who served as Deputy Prime Minister from May 1999 to May 2000.

She was the head girl at Adi Cakobau School in 1968, and went on to graduate from the University of the South Pacific and from the Australian National University in Canberra. She subsequently pursued a career in the Public Relations Office, which later became the Ministry of Information. On behalf of the Fiji Public Service Association, she led several delegations to the United Nations.

== Political career ==

The widow of Fiji Labour Party founder and former Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, &quot;Adi&quot; Kuini became the leader of the Labour Party after her husband&#x27;s death in 1989, but resigned in 1991 to take up residence for a few years in Canberra, Australia. She was succeeded by Mahendra Chaudhry as leader of the Fiji Labour Party. &quot;Adi&quot; Kuini returned to Fiji in 1994 and became leader of the Fijian Association Party (FAP) in 1998 succeeding the former Finance Minister Josefata Kamikamica. Under her leadership, the FAP won 11 seats in the 71-member House of Representatives in the election of 1999. Forming a coalition with her former party, the Fiji Labour Party &quot;Adi&quot; Kuini became one of two Deputy Prime Ministers in the coalition government led by Mahendra Chaudhry.

The Chaudhry government was deposed on 19 May 2000 in a coup organized by George Speight. After the coup had been put down, she refused to support the possible return of Chaudhry as Prime Minister, however, claiming that Fiji needed a less controversial leader to bring about reconciliation among Fiji&#x27;s ethnic communities and repair fractured multiracial relations. 

In poor health following repeated operations on a brain tumor, she contested the elections held to restore democracy in September 2001, but all of her party&#x27;s candidates were defeated as the ethnic Fijian community rallied around the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) of Laisenia Qarase. &quot;Adi&quot; Kuini herself lost her Serua-Navosa Open Constituency to the SDL&#x27;s Pio Wong.

== Personal life ==
&quot;Adi&quot; Kuini was the daughter of &quot;Ratu&quot; Aseri Qoro Latianara (1924–1998), whom she succeeded as &quot;Tui Noikoro&quot; Paramount Chief of Navosa, and of Lanieta Vuni; she herself was duly succeeded in these roles by her brother, &quot;Ratu&quot; Tomasi Latianara.

&quot;Adi&quot; Kuini was married three times, first to Military officer Savenaca Draunidalo (a Minister from 2001 to 2006), subsequently to Bavadra and finally to Clive Speed, a former director of the Business Council of Australia. She had four children (including the well-known lawyer Tupou Draunidalo, who became President of the National Federation Party in 2014 and was subsequently elected to Parliament that year) and eleven stepchildren. By the end of 2004, when she lost a long battle with cancer, she was the grandmother of three. She is buried in Korolevu, a two-hour drive from Sigatoka.

Politicians remembered &quot;Adi&quot; Kuini as a committed Christian and champion of racial tolerance, and as one who fought for reform of the chiefly system by insisting on standards of accountability for all chiefs.

<text>Ralliement national (RN) (in English: &quot;National Rally&quot;) was a separatist and right-wing populist provincial political party that advocated the political independence of Quebec from Canada in the 1960s.

The party was led by former &quot;créditiste&quot; Gilles Grégoire. Unlike the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale led by Pierre Bourgault, a left-wing party, the &quot;Ralliement national&quot; was more right of centre on the political spectrum.

The &quot;Ralliement national&quot; was formed in 1966 following a merger between the Regroupement national (a dissident wing of Bourgault&#x27;s RIN) and a pro-independence group that broke away from the Ralliement des créditistes in 1965.

In the 1966 Quebec general election, the Ralliement national and the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale won about 8.8% of the popular vote and no seats.

In 1968, the Ralliement national agreed to merge with René Lévesque&#x27;s Mouvement souveraineté-association to form the Parti Québécois under Lévesque&#x27;s leadership.

After that, Pierre Bourgault disbanded the RIN and invited its members to join the new PQ. At that point, sovereigntist forces in Quebec were united, and three elections later, the PQ won the 1976 Quebec general election.

<doc id="525914" wikidata="Q13472752" url="?curid=525914" title="Valet">
<text>A valet or varlet is a male servant who serves as personal attendant to his employer. In the Middle Ages and Ancien Régime, valet de chambre was a role for junior courtiers and specialists such as artists in a royal court, but the term &quot;valet&quot; by itself most often refers to a normal servant responsible for the clothes and personal belongings of an employer, and making minor arrangements. In the United States, the term most often refers to a parking valet, and the role is often confused with a butler.

== Word origins ==
In English, &quot;valet&quot; as &quot;personal man-servant&quot; is recorded since 1567, though use of the term in the French-speaking English medieval court is older, and the variant form &quot;varlet&quot; is cited from 1456 (OED). Both are French importations of &quot;valet&quot; or &quot;varlet&quot; (the &quot;t&quot; being silent in modern French), Old French variants of &quot;vaslet&quot; &quot;man&#x27;s servant&quot;, originally &quot;squire, young man&quot;, assumed to be from Gallo-Romance Vulgar Latin *&quot;vassellittus&quot; &quot;young nobleman, squire, page&quot;, diminutive of Medieval Latin &quot;vassallus&quot;, from &quot;vassus&quot; &quot;servant&quot;, possibly cognate to an Old Celtic root &quot;wasso-&quot; &quot;young man, squire&quot; (source of Welsh &quot;gwas&quot; &quot;youth, servant&quot;, Breton &quot;servant, vassal, man&quot;, Irish &quot;servant&quot;). See yeoman, possibly derived from &quot;yonge man&quot;, a related term.

The modern use is usually short for the &quot;&quot; (French for &quot;room valet&quot;, in modern terms the bedroom, though not originally so), described in the following section.

Since the 16th century, the word has traditionally been pronounced as rhyming with &quot;pallet&quot;, though an alternative pronunciation, rhyming with &quot;array&quot; and &quot;allay&quot;, as in French, is now common, particularly in the United States. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists both pronunciations.

==Domestic valet==

A valet or &quot;gentleman&#x27;s gentleman&quot; is a gentleman&#x27;s male servant; the closest female equivalent is a lady&#x27;s maid. The valet performs personal services such as maintaining his employer&#x27;s clothes, running his bath and perhaps (especially in the past) shaving his employer.

In a great house, the master of the house had his own valet, and in the very grandest great houses, other adult members of the employing family (e.g. master&#x27;s sons) would also have their own valets.

At a court, even minor princes and high officials may be assigned one, but in a smaller household the butler – the majordomo in charge of the household staff – might have to double as his employer&#x27;s valet. In a bachelor&#x27;s household the valet might perform light housekeeping duties as well.

Valets learned the skills for their role in various ways. Some began as footmen, learning some relevant skills as part of that job, and picking up others when deputising for their master&#x27;s valet, or by performing valeting tasks for his sons before they had a valet of their own, or for male guests who did not travel with a valet. Others started out as soldier-servants to army officers (batmen) or stewards to naval officers.

Traditionally, a valet did much more than merely lay out clothes and take care of personal items. He was also responsible for making travel arrangements, dealing with any bills and handling all money matters concerning his master or his master&#x27;s household.

Alexandre Bontemps, the most senior of the thirty-six valets to Louis XIV of France, was a powerful figure, who ran the Château de Versailles. In courts, valet de chambre was a position of some status, often given to artists, musicians, poets and others, who generally spent most of their time on their specialized work. The role was also, at least during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a common first step or training period in a nobleman&#x27;s career at court.

Valets, like butlers and most specialized domestic staff, have become relatively rare. A more common, though still infrequent, arrangement is the general servant performing combined roles.

A notable 20th century domestic valet was Sydney Johnson who served as personal valet to the Duke of Windsor and later to the businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed.

Another notable person is Walt Nauta, a former military valet, who worked at the White House and later at Mar-a-Lago as Donald Trump&#x27;s personal valet. On July 6, 2023, he pleaded not guilty for allegedly moving boxes of classified materials at Mar-a-Lago.

<text>An oshizushihako (, literally: pressed sushi box) is a box or mold used to make &quot;oshizushi&quot; (pressed sushi). The box is traditionally made from wood, but nowadays often made from plastic.

It can be disassembled into three parts: a bottom part, the rectangular walls, and a top part. Before use, the wooden box should be put in water to reduce sticking of the rice. The bottom and top parts can be covered with a layer of plastic foil for easier cleaning. The bottom part and the walls are assembled before the rice and the topping is added. Next, the top part is used to press down on the sushi, hence the name &quot;pressed sushi&quot;. For disassembly, the rectangular walls are pulled up while the top part still presses against the sushi. After removing the top part, the sushi is cut and can be served.

A variant of the &quot;oshizushihako&quot; has half cylindrical shapes cut from the thicker top and bottom parts so that the sushi is pressed in a cylindrical shape.
