<text>The metre–tonne–second (MTS) system of units was invented in France (hence the derived unit names &quot;sthène&quot; and &quot;pièze&quot;) where it became the legal system between 1919 and 1961. It was adopted by the Soviet Union in 1933 and abolished there in 1955. It was a coherent metric system of units, much as SI (itself a refinement of the MKS system) and the centimetre–gram–second system (CGS), but with larger units for industrial use, whereas the CGS system was regarded as only really suitable for laboratory use.

== Units ==
The base units of the MTS system are:
* Length: metre
* Mass: tonne,
*: 1 t = 103 kg = 1 Mg
* Time: second

Some common derived units:
* Volume: cubic metre or stere
*: 1 m3 ≡ 1 st
* Force: sthène,
*: 1 sn = 1 t⋅m/s2 = 103 N = 1 kN
* Energy: sthène-metre = kilojoule,
*: 1 sn⋅m = 1 t⋅m2/s2 = 103 J = 1 kJ 
* Power: sthène-metre per second = kilowatt,
*: 1 sn⋅m/s = 1 t⋅m2/s3 = 103 W = 1 kW
* Pressure: pièze,
*: 1 pz = 1 t/m⋅s2 = 103 Pa = 1 kPa = 1 cbar (centibar)

<text>The Young Plan was a 1929 attempt to settle issues surrounding the World War I reparations obligations that Germany owed under the terms of Treaty of Versailles. Developed to replace the 1924 Dawes Plan, the Young Plan was negotiated in Paris from February to June 1929 by a committee of international financial experts under the leadership of American businessman and economist Owen D. Young. Representatives of the affected governments then finalised and approved the plan at The Hague conference of 1929/30. Reparations were set at 36 billion Reichsmarks payable through 1988. Including interest, the total came to 112 billion Reichsmarks. The average annual payment was approximately two billion Reichsmarks (US$473 million in 1929). The plan came into effect on 17 May 1930, retroactive to 1 September 1929.

In a parallel agreement, France agreed to withdraw its troops from the occupied Rhineland in 1930, five years earlier than called for in the Treaty of Versailles.

Due to the effects of the Great Depression, the Young Plan was suspended by the Hoover Moratorium in June 1931 and payments reduced by 90% at the Lausanne Conference in July 1932. The National Socialist government under Adolf Hitler made no payments after it came to power in 1933. However, Germany continued to pay interest on Dawes and Young bonds until 1939.

== Origins ==

=== Problems with the Dawes Plan ===
The Treaty of Versailles did not set the total amount or the terms for German reparations. It established an interim 20 billion Reichsmarks to be paid through April 1920 and left the full details to be determined by the Inter-Allied Reparations Commission. The Commission drew up the May 1921 London Schedule of Payments that fixed the total sum at 132 billion Reichsmarks. After Germany was declared in default in January 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr. Germany responded with passive resistance to the occupation, and the government&#x27;s payments to the idled workers of the Ruhr fuelled the hyperinflation that nearly wrecked the economy. The Dawes Plan of 1924 was drafted to replace the London Schedule.

The Dawes Plan came into effect on 1 September 1924. It reopened the American capital market to Germany, and billions in long-term bonds and short-term loans flowed to the German private and public sectors in roughly equal parts. The economy of the Weimar Republic grew significantly during the Golden Twenties (1924–1929), and in spite of a negative trade balance, there was enough foreign exchange to pay the instalments of the plan. The payments came, however, at the price of a large foreign debt.

All sides began to be more uneasy about the plan from 1927 onwards. Wall Street banks and the United States Treasury grew increasingly concerned that Germany would become overindebted. Since 1924, foreign loans worth more than ten billion Reichsmarks had flowed into Germany. The question arose as to whether private loans or reparations should have priority in the event of a payment crisis.The French government also became increasingly concerned. Since 1919 the United States had been calling for the repayment of the inter-allied war debts incurred by France in 1917 and 1918. France urgently needed loans to stabilise the franc after the inflation of 1924 and 1925, but the American capital market was closed to it as long as the war debt remained unpaid. The matter was settled with the Mellon–Berenger Agreement in April 1926 that established a schedule for French repayment to the United States. The French Chamber of Deputies, however, refused to ratify it until the German reparations issue was settled. Since the money from Germany was to be used for French payments to the United States, France became more willing to agree to a new reparations plan, even to settle for less than the 132 billion gold marks demanded in the 1921 London Schedule of Payments.

Germany was not completely satisfied with the Dawes Plan either. In 1928 the full annual payment of 2.5 billion Reichsmarks was due for the first time. It corresponded to 12.4 per cent of total German government expenditure and 3.3 per cent of national income. If the economy continued to develop positively, the plan&#x27;s prosperity index would have required an even higher sum, which could have threatened to exceed Germany&#x27;s ability to pay.

Following extensive diplomatic consultations during the autumn meeting of the League of Nations, the six interested powers – Germany France, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy and Japan – agreed on 16 September 1928 to set up an international commission of experts under the leadership of American economist Owen D. Young to settle the reparations question and at the same time to begin negotiations on the evacuation of the occupied Rhineland. The fourteen international financial experts chosen to draw up the new reparations plan were to be independent and guided only by their economic expertise.

=== Hague Conference ===
The governments of the six powers that had commissioned the drafting of the Young Plan agreed to it in principle in June 1929. The foreign ministers of France and Germany, Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann, then called for a conference to be held to decide on the final settlement of all questions still arising from the First World War.

At the first session of the Hague Conference from 6 to 31 August 1929, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, Labour Party politician Philip Snowden, demanded an increase of annual reparations payments to Britain by the equivalent of 48 million Reichsmarks. Snowden signalled that he was prepared to let the Young Plan fail if necessary. A solution was reached through shifts within the creditor instalments, above all at German expense, and compromise solutions were found on the question of deliveries in kind. Briand was then prepared to give in on the evacuation of the Rhineland and agreed to 30 June 1930 as the final date for the occupation.

The second session of the conference took place from 3 to 20 January 1930. Issues of a mostly technical nature were clarified, specifically the establishment of the Bank for International Settlements to handle the transfer of reparations payments and the question of whether, as provided for in the Treaty of Versailles, creditors could continue to impose sanctions in the event of a German default. It was agreed that the creditor nations would regain their &quot;full freedom of action&quot; if the International Court of Justice found that Germany was in the process of &quot;tearing up&quot; the Young Plan. The French saw in the statement the chance to fall back on the robust sanctions possibilities of the Versailles Treaty, while the Germans recognised in it merely the freedom of action to which every sovereign state was entitled under international law.

Due to the New York stock market crash of 24 October 1929, which had occurred between the two sessions at The Hague, it had become apparent that for the foreseeable future the American capital market would be unable to pre-finance the entire value of the German reparations debt for the European creditor powers. They had wanted to use mobilisation bonds to be able to repay the inter-Allied war debt to the US in a lump sum. The &quot;New Plan&quot;, as the Young Plan was officially called, and the agreement on the evacuation of the Rhineland were nevertheless signed by the heads of government of the six powers on 20 January 1930.

== Plan content ==
The Young Plan provided for a German reparation debt of the equivalent of 36 billion Reichsmarks. It was to be repaid with interest through 1988, resulting in a total sum of 112 billion Reichsmarks. The annual instalments were to rise rapidly from 1.7 billion to 2.1 billion Reichsmarks, falling to 1.65 billion after 1966. Taking 1930 as a basis, Germany would be required to pay annually, on average, the equivalent of about 12 per cent of its exports, 2.5 per cent of its net national product and 7.3 per cent of all public revenues.

The transfer protection of the Dawes Plan was abolished, meaning that in the future, Germany was responsible for ensuring that the sum raised from tax revenue could be transferred in foreign currency or in kind to the Bank for International Settlements. The institution took over the functions of the Reparation Commission, which was abolished, as was the office of the general agent for reparations payments. The control that the creditor powers had secured in the Dawes Plan over the German National Railway and the Reichsbank were also dropped, as was the prosperity index, which meant that Germany could be sure that it would not have to pay more if the economic situation was favourable.

The deliveries in kind (as, for example, coal), which had often competed with companies in the creditor countries, were to expire after ten years. The remaining payment obligation in foreign currency was divided into an unprotected instalment, which had to be transferred in foreign currency under all circumstances and amounted to a constant 600 million Reichsmarks. The protected instalment, which was more than twice as large, could initially be transferred in Reichsmarks in the event of a &quot;relatively short depression&quot;, but the foreign currency had to be delivered within two years. The protected instalment was closely linked to inter-allied war debts through the Concurrent Memorandum that the creditor powers attached to the Young Plan.

On 17 May 1930, the Young Plan came into force retroactively to 1 September 1929. At the same time, the Young bond was put on the market. Germany borrowed 1.47 billion Reichsmarks (300 million gold marks) at 5.5 percent interest for 35 years. Two-thirds of the sum went to the reparation creditors and to support the German economy and one-third to the postal service and the national railway. In spite of the poor capital market after the Wall Street crash, the bond was a success with the international public.

== Reactions ==

=== France ===
The Young Plan was mostly welcomed in France. The left-wing and liberal press judged it positively; only on the political right was criticism levelled that the plan and its accompanying withdrawal from the Rhineland affected both the financial and military security of the French Republic.
Since all the governments from 1926 to 1932 were based on the political centre in coalition with the nationalists and right-wing Catholics, difficulties arose in the French parliament. It had not been possible to complete the Young Plan by July 1929, the deadline for ratification of the agreement on inter-allied war debts. Poincaré therefore had to ask the parliament to ratify the Mellon–Berenger Agreement on French debt owed to the United States before Germany had agreed to the Young Plan. Both the political right and the opposition Socialists, who otherwise supported Briand&#x27;s foreign policy, insisted on linking the two debts, a position that the United States strongly opposed. By a narrow majority, the Chamber of Deputies approved the Mellon–Bérenger Agreement on 12 July 1929 with the reservation that it would only be serviced as long as sufficient reparations were collected from Germany. Since a conditional ratification would not be recognised by the United States, the reservation did not acquire legal force and only the debt agreement became legally binding. Poincaré resigned a few days later.

He was succeeded by Aristide Briand, whose attempt to pass the Young Plan also failed. After he too resigned, André Tardieu of the Democratic Republican Alliance became prime minister. He succeeded on 29 March 1930 in securing a majority for the ratification of the Young Plan. Following the wishes of several deputies of the Republican Federation, he had delayed the parliamentary debate until the German Reichstag had given its approval. The speech of the new finance minister Paul Reynaud expressed a highly positive balance: the Young Plan had put reparations on an equal footing with Germany&#x27;s private debt and thus secured them, it covered the inter-allied war debts and generated a surplus for the reconstruction of French territories destroyed in the war. Although Versailles&#x27; original sum of 132 billion gold marks plus interest had had to be dropped, &quot;the sacrifice is the price of the permanent solution&quot;. He did not mention the original goal of mobilising reparations on a large scale and repaying the inter-allied debt as a lump sum because a financial operation of such a magnitude had become impossible after the New York Stock Exchange crash.

After the adoption of the Young Plan, the French sought closer cooperation with Germany. Tardieu told the German ambassador that &quot;conscious rapprochement with Germany&quot; was the goal of his government. With the seemingly permanent solution to the reparations question and the withdrawal from the occupied Rhineland, the last points of contention stemming from the Treaty of Versailles appeared to have been resolved and the way cleared for a secure and peaceful future.

=== Germany ===
Although the Young Plan had effectively reduced Germany&#x27;s obligations, it was opposed by parts of the political spectrum in Germany. Nationalist parties had been most outspoken against reparations and seized on the Young Plan as an issue. A committee was formed of various nationalist groups under the leadership of Alfred Hugenberg, a media baron and head of the German National People&#x27;s Party. One of the groups that joined was the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler.

The committee&#x27;s goal was the enactment of what it called the &quot;Law Against the Enslavement of the German People&quot;, or in its shortened form, the &quot;Freedom Law&quot;. It would renounce all reparations and make it a criminal offense for any German official to sign a treaty that imposed new reparations obligations. It would also renounce the German acknowledgement of war guilt and the occupation of German territory, both of which were terms of the Treaty of Versailles The Freedom Law proposal was officially presented on 16 October 1929. The committee succeeded in collecting enough signatures to put the proposal before the Reichstag, which voted the bill down by a 318–82 margin. In the subsequent Freedom Law referendum, 94.5% of the votes cast were in favour of the proposed law, but voter turnout was just 14.9%, meaning that only 13.8% of eligible voters had voted in favour of the law. The referendum therefore failed, since it needed 50% of all eligible voters to pass.

The Young Plan was accepted by the Reichstag on 12 March 1930.

==Subsequent events==

The Wall Street Crash of October 1929 had occurred between the initial agreement and the adoption of the Young Plan. With the severe world-wide economic downturn that heralded the Great Depression, United States President Herbert Hoover won support for a one-year moratorium on reparations payments from 15 nations by July 1931. A final effort to resolve the reparations issue was made at the Lausanne Conference of 1932. It essentially ended Germany&#x27;s reparations payments.

However, Germany continued to pay interest on both Dawes and Young bonds, issued in 1924 and 1930. These were traded on the London Stock Exchange until the end of World War II, with Germany only stopping interest payments at the outbreak of war in 1939. In November 1934, Britain and Germany made what is known as the Anglo-German Payments Agreement, wherein among other terms, Germany agreed to continue paying interest on both Dawes and Young bonds in sterling.

It is estimated that Germany&#x27;s total reparations payments up to 1931 came to about 36.1 billion marks.

After Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War II, an international conference (London Agreement on German External Debts, 1953) decided that Germany would pay the remaining debt only after the country was reunified. West Germany nevertheless paid off the principal by 1980; then in 1995, after reunification, the new German government announced it would resume payments of the interest, including on the Young bonds. Germany was due to pay off the interest to the United States in 2010, and to other countries in 2020. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that Germany made &quot;final reparations-related payment for the Great War on Oct. 3, nearly 92 years after the country&#x27;s defeat by the Allies&quot;.

<doc id="524124" wikidata="Q1194002" url="?curid=524124" title="Hypercharge">
<text>In particle physics, the hypercharge (a portmanteau of hyperonic and charge) &quot;Y&quot; of a particle is a quantum number conserved under the strong interaction. The concept of hypercharge provides a single charge operator that accounts for properties of isospin, electric charge, and flavour. The hypercharge is useful to classify hadrons; the similarly named weak hypercharge has an analogous role in the electroweak interaction.

==Definition==
Hypercharge is one of two quantum numbers of the SU(3) model of hadrons, alongside isospin . The isospin alone was sufficient for two quark flavours — namely and — whereas presently 6 flavours of quarks are known.

SU(3) weight diagrams (see below) are 2 dimensional, with the coordinates referring to two quantum numbers: (also known as ), which is the  component of isospin, and , which is the hypercharge (defined by strangeness , charm , bottomness , topness , and baryon number ). Mathematically, hypercharge is 

:formula_1

Strong interactions conserve hypercharge (and weak hypercharge), but weak interactions do &quot;not&quot;.

==Relation with electric charge and isospin==

The Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula relates isospin and electric charge

:formula_2

where &quot;I&quot;3 is the third component of isospin and &quot;Q&quot; is the particle&#x27;s charge.

Isospin creates multiplets of particles whose average charge is related to the hypercharge by:
:formula_3

since the hypercharge is the same for all members of a multiplet, and the average of the &quot;I&quot;3 values is 0.

These definitions in their original form hold only for the three lightest quarks.

==SU(3) model in relation to hypercharge==
The SU(2) model has multiplets characterized by a quantum number &quot;J&quot;, which is the total angular momentum. Each multiplet consists of substates with equally-spaced values of &quot;Jz&quot;, forming a symmetric arrangement seen in atomic spectra and isospin. This formalizes the observation that certain strong baryon decays were not observed, leading to the prediction of the mass, strangeness and charge of the baryon.

The SU(3) has &quot;supermultiplets&quot; containing SU(2) multiplets. SU(3) now needs two numbers to specify all its sub-states which are denoted by &quot;λ&quot;1 and &quot;λ&quot;2.

 specifies the number of points in the topmost side of the hexagon while specifies the number of points on the bottom side.

==Examples==
* The nucleon group (protons with and neutrons with ) have an average charge of , so they both have hypercharge (since baryon number and ). From the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula we know that proton has isospin while neutron has 
* This also works for quarks: For the &quot;up&quot; quark, with a charge of , and an of , we deduce a hypercharge of , due to its baryon number (since three quarks make a baryon, each quark has a baryon number of ).
* For a &quot;strange&quot; quark, with electric charge , a baryon number of , and strangeness −1, we get a hypercharge so we deduce that That means that a &quot;strange&quot; quark makes an isospin singlet of its own (the same happens with &quot;charm&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot; quarks), while &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; constitute an isospin doublet.
* All other quarks have hypercharge .

==Practical obsolescence==
Hypercharge was a concept developed in the 1960s, to organize groups of particles in the &quot;particle zoo&quot; and to develop &quot;ad hoc&quot; conservation laws based on their observed transformations. With the advent of the quark model, it is now obvious that strong hypercharge, , is the following combination of the numbers of up (), down (), strange (), charm (), top () and bottom ():

:formula_4

In modern descriptions of hadron interaction, it has become more obvious to draw Feynman diagrams that trace through the individual constituent quarks (which are conserved) composing the interacting baryons and mesons, rather than bothering to count strong hypercharge quantum numbers. &quot;Weak hypercharge&quot;, however, remains an essential part of understanding the electroweak interaction.

<text>Yi Ta Hu Tu (; YTHT BBS) is a bulletin board system which was created on September 17, 1999, by student Lepton in Peking University, Beijing, China. Prior to being blocked by the government, it was one of the largest BBS communities in China.

In Chinese, Yi Ta Hu Tu means &#x27;extremely messy&#x27; literally. However, the name itself is a pun; Ta, Hu, and Tu also mean &quot;tower&quot; &quot;lake&quot; &quot;picture&quot; respectively, and they are used to refer to three famous sites inside Peking University: Porter Tower, Weiming (&quot;nameless&quot;) Lake, and the Peking University Library (the Chinese word for &quot;library&quot; is 图书馆 tu-shu-guan, with &quot;tu&quot; as its first character). Yi means &quot;one&quot;.

YTHT was originally set up by Lepton, a graduate student at the physics department in Peking University (PKU), on September 17, 1999, serving mainly as a communication platform for the students of PKU. Since the former PKU bulletin board system, the Unknown Space, was forced to be closed as required by the censorship of the Chinese government, PKU has not been able to hold a BBS of its own for a long term. When YTHT was born, it soon attracted the attentions of many PKU native students. Despite the fact that PKU launched its official BBS later on, Wei Ming station, YTHT still managed to burgeon into one of the best and biggest BBS systems in the education network in China with more than 300,000 users, mainly students and well-educated professionals. This figure compares to some of the largest Internet forums in the United States.

On September 20, 1999, the login screen was changed to the one with a tower, a lake and the famous library of PKU. The three Chinese names combined forms a homonym of YTHT. On March 24, 2000, the URL changed to &quot;ytht.net&quot;. On May 3, 2000, the first YTHT Committee was democratically elected by YTHT members, for the first time in China&#x27;s history.

In the history of the development of YTHT, the spirit of freedom and democracy was a priority, although its popularity resulted in huge political pressure and YTHT was banned a few times.

On August 19, 2004, YTHT was required by the government to be in a status of emergency. Several boards on political topics were shut down.

Finally, on September 13, 2004, the Beijing Communication Administration shut down YTHT. At the same time, all the Internet forums in China were required by law to remove all discussion about YTHT. The words &quot;ytht&quot;, &quot;一塌糊涂&quot;, and &quot;糊涂&quot; are now blocked from Chinese ISPs. One of the major Chinese search engines also blocks these words.

It was reopened in April 2007. As of May 2007, the BBS is still in working order. However, since the Chinese education network is segregated from the overseas backbone, the mainland students have difficulties connecting to the BBS, which actually hurts its popularity.

<doc id="524129" wikidata="Q1259372" url="?curid=524129" title="Secret Gospel of Mark">
<text>The Secret Gospel of Mark or the Mystic Gospel of Mark (), also the Longer Gospel of Mark, is a longer and secret or mystic version of the Gospel of Mark. The gospel is mentioned exclusively in the Mar Saba letter, a document of disputed authenticity, which is said to have been written by Clement of Alexandria (). This letter, in turn, is preserved only in photographs of a Greek handwritten copy seemingly transcribed in the 18th century into the endpapers of a 17th-century printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. Some scholars suggest that the letter implies that Jesus was involved in homosexual activity, although this interpretation is contested.

In 1958, Morton Smith, a professor of ancient history at Columbia University, found a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria in the monastery of Mar Saba situated south-east of Jerusalem. He made a formal announcement of the discovery in 1960 and published his study of the text in 1973. The original manuscript was subsequently transferred to the library of the Greek Orthodox Church in Jerusalem, and sometime after 1990, it was lost. Further research has relied upon photographs and copies, including those made by Smith himself.

In the letter, addressed to one otherwise unknown Theodore (Theodoros), Clement says that &quot;when Peter died a martyr, Mark [i.e. Mark the Evangelist] came over to Alexandria, bringing both his own notes and those of Peter, from which he transferred to his former book [i.e. the Gospel of Mark] the things suitable to whatever makes for progress toward knowledge.&quot; He further says that Mark left this extended version, known today as the Secret Gospel of Mark, &quot;to the church in Alexandria, where it even yet is most carefully guarded, being read only to those who are being initiated into the great mysteries.&quot; Clement quotes two passages from this Secret Gospel of Mark, where Jesus in the longer passage is said to have raised a rich young man from the dead in Bethany, a story which shares many similarities with the story of the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John.

The revelation of the letter caused a sensation at the time but was soon met with accusations of forgery and misrepresentation. There is no consensus on the authenticity of the letter among either patristic Clement scholars or biblical scholars. As the text is made up of two texts, a handful of possibilities exist: both may be authentic or inauthentic, or one may be authentic and the other inauthentic. Those who think the letter is a forgery mostly think it is a modern forgery, with Smith being denounced the most often as the perpetrator. If the letter is a modern forgery, the excerpts from the Secret Gospel of Mark would also be forgeries. Some accept the letter as genuine but do not believe in Clement&#x27;s account, and instead argue that the gospel is a 2nd-century Gnostic pastiche. Others think Clement&#x27;s information is accurate and that the secret gospel is a second edition of the Gospel of Mark expanded by Mark himself. Still others see the Secret Gospel of Mark as the original gospel which predates the canonical Gospel of Mark, and where canonical Mark is the result of the Secret Mark passages quoted by Clement and other passages being removed, either by Mark himself or by someone else at a later stage.

There is an ongoing controversy surrounding the authenticity of the Mar Saba letter. The scholarly community is divided as to the authenticity, and the debate on Secret Mark therefore in a state of stalemate, although the debate continues.

== Discovery ==
=== Smith&#x27;s discovery of the Mar Saba letter ===

During a trip to Jordan, Israel, Turkey, and Greece in the summer of 1958 &quot;hunting for collections of manuscripts&quot;, Morton Smith also visited the Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba situated between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea. He had been granted permission by the Patriarch Benedict I of Jerusalem to stay there for three weeks and study its manuscripts. It was while cataloguing documents in the tower library of Mar Saba, he later reported, that he discovered a previously unknown letter written by Clement of Alexandria in which Clement quoted two passages from a likewise previously unknown longer version of the Gospel of Mark, which Smith later named the &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;. The text of the letter was handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius&#x27; 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. This letter is referred to by many names, including the Mar Saba letter, the Clement letter, the Letter to Theodore and Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore.

As the book was &quot;the property of the Greek Patriarchate&quot;, Smith just took some black-and-white photographs of the letter and left the book where he had found it, in the tower library. Smith realized, that if he were to authenticate the letter, he needed to share its contents with other scholars. In December 1958, to ensure that no one would reveal its content prematurely, he submitted a of the letter with a preliminary translation to the Library of Congress.

After having spent two years comparing the style, vocabulary, and ideas of Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore with the undisputed writings of Clement of Alexandria and having consulted a number of paleographic experts who dated the handwriting to the eighteenth century, Smith felt confident enough about its authenticity and so announced his discovery at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in December 1960. In the following years, he made a thorough study of Mark, Clement and the letter&#x27;s background and relationship to early Christianity, during which time he consulted many experts in the relevant fields. In 1966 he had basically completed his study, but the result in the form of the scholarly book &quot;Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark&quot; was not published until 1973 due to seven years of delay &quot;in the production stage&quot;. In the book, Smith published a set of black-and-white photographs of the text. Earlier the same year he also published a second book for the popular audience.

=== Subsequent history of the manuscript ===

For many years it was thought that only Smith had seen the manuscript. However, in 2003 Guy Stroumsa reported that he and a group of other scholars saw it in 1976. Stroumsa, along with the late Hebrew University professors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines and Greek Orthodox Archimandrite Meliton, went to Mar Saba to look for the book. With the help of a Mar Saba monk, they relocated it where Smith presumably had left it 18 years earlier, and with &quot;Clement&#x27;s letter written on the blank pages at the end of the book&quot;. Stroumsa, Meliton, and company determined that the manuscript might be safer in Jerusalem than in Mar Saba. They took the book back with them, and Meliton subsequently brought it to the Patriarchate library. The group looked into having the ink tested but the only entity in the area with such technology was the Jerusalem police. Meliton did not want to leave the manuscript with the police, so no test was taken. Stroumsa published his account upon learning that he was the &quot;last [known] living Western scholar&quot; to have seen the letter.

Subsequent research has uncovered more about the manuscript. Around 1977, librarian Father Kallistos Dourvas removed the two pages containing the text from the book for the purpose of photographing and re-cataloguing them. However, the re-cataloguing obviously never happened. Dourvas later told Charles W. Hedrick and Nikolaos Olympiou that the pages were then kept separately alongside the book at least until his retirement in 1990. Sometime after that, however, the pages went missing, and various attempts to locate them since that time have been unsuccessful. Olympiou suggests that individuals at the Patriarchate Library may be withholding the pages due to Morton Smith&#x27;s homoerotic interpretation of the text, or the pages could have been destroyed or misplaced. Kallistos Dourvas gave color photographs of the manuscript to Olympiou, and Hedrick and Olympiou published them in &quot;The Fourth R&quot; in 2000.

These color photographs were made in 1983 by Dourvas at a photo studio. But this was arranged and paid for by Quentin Quesnell. In June 1983, Quesnell was given permission to study the manuscript at the library for several days during a three-week period under the supervision of Dourvas. Quesnell was &quot;the first scholar to make a formal case that the Mar Saba document might be a forgery&quot; and he was &quot;extremely critical&quot; of Smith, especially for not making the document available to his peers and for providing such low-quality photographs. Yet, Quesnell did not tell his peers that he had also examined the manuscript and did not reveal that he already had these high-quality color photographs of the letter at home in 1983. Hedrick and Olympiou were not aware of this when they published, in 2000, copies of the same photographs that Dourvas had kept himself. The scholarly community was unaware of Quesnell&#x27;s visit until 2007 when Adela Yarbro Collins briefly mentioned that he was allowed to look at the manuscript in the early 1980s. A couple of years after Quesnell&#x27;s death in 2012, scholars were given access to the notes from his trip to Jerusalem. They show that Quesnell at first was confident that he would be able to establish that the document was a forgery. However, when he found something he thought was suspicious, Dourvas (who was confident that it was authentic 18th-century handwriting) would present other 18th-century handwriting with similar characteristics. Quesnell admitted that since &quot;they&#x27;re not all forgeries&quot; it would not be as easy to prove that the text is a forgery as he had expected. Eventually, he gave up his attempts and wrote that experts had to be consulted.

, the manuscript&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown, and it is documented only in the two sets of photographs: Smith&#x27;s black-and-white set from 1958 and the color set from 1983. The ink and fiber were never subjected to examination.

== Content according to Clement&#x27;s letter ==

The Mar Saba letter is addressed to one Theodore (), who seems to have asked if there is a gospel of Mark in which the words &quot;naked man with naked man&quot; () and &quot;other things&quot; are present. Clement confirms that Mark wrote a second, longer, mystic and more spiritual version of his gospel, and that this gospel was &quot;very securely kept&quot; in the Alexandrian church, but that it contained no such words. Clement accuses the heterodox teacher Carpocrates for having obtained a copy by deceit and then polluted it with &quot;utterly shameless lies&quot;. To refute the teachings of the gnostic sect of Carpocratians, known for their sexual libertinism, and to show that these words were absent in the true Secret Gospel of Mark, Clement quoted two passages from it.

There were accordingly three versions of Mark known to Clement, &quot;Original Mark&quot;, &quot;Secret Mark&quot;, and &quot;Carpocratian Mark&quot;. The Secret Gospel of Mark is described as a second &quot;more spiritual&quot; version of the Gospel of Mark composed by the evangelist himself. The name derives from Smith&#x27;s translation of the phrase &quot;mystikon euangelion&quot;. However, Clement simply refers to the gospel as written by Mark. To distinguish between the longer and shorter versions of Mark&#x27;s gospel, he twice refers to the non-canonical gospel as a (either a secret gospel whose existence was concealed or a mystic gospel &quot;pertaining to the mysteries&quot; with concealed meanings), in the same way as he refers to it as &quot;a more spiritual gospel&quot;. &quot;To Clement, &quot;both&quot; versions were the Gospel of Mark&quot;. The purpose of the gospel was supposedly to encourage knowledge (&quot;gnosis&quot;) among more advanced Christians, and it is said to have been in use in liturgies in Alexandria.

=== The quotes from Secret Mark ===
The letter includes two excerpts from the Secret Gospel. The first passage, Clement says, was inserted between Mark 10:34 and 35; after the paragraph where Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem with the disciples makes the third prediction of his death, and before Mark 10:35–45 where the disciples James and John ask Jesus to grant them honor and glory. It shows many similarities with the story in John 11:1–44 where Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. According to Clement, the passage reads word for word ():

And they come into Bethany. And a certain woman whose brother had died was there. And, coming, she prostrated herself before Jesus and says to him, &quot;Son of David, have mercy on me.&quot; But the disciples rebuked her. And Jesus, being angered, went off with her into the garden where the tomb was, and straightway a great cry was heard from the tomb. And going near Jesus rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. And straightway, going in where the youth was, he stretched forth his hand and raised him, seizing his hand. But the youth, looking upon him, loved him and began to beseech him that he might be with him. And going out of the tomb they came into the house of the youth, for he was rich. And after six days Jesus told him what to do and in the evening the youth comes to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God. And thence, arising, he returned to the other side of the Jordan.

The second excerpt is very brief and was inserted in Mark 10:46. Clement says that &quot;after the words, &#x27;And he comes into Jericho&#x27; [and before &#x27;and as he went out of Jericho&#x27;] the secret Gospel adds only&quot;:

And the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there, and Jesus did not receive them.

Clement continues: &quot;But the many other things about which you wrote both seem to be and are falsifications.&quot; Just as Clement is about to give the true explanation of the passages, the letter breaks off.

These two excerpts comprise the entirety of the Secret Gospel material. No separate text of the secret gospel is known to survive, and it is not referred to in any other ancient source. Some scholars have found it suspicious that an authentic ancient Christian text would be preserved only in a single, late manuscript. However, this is not unprecedented.

== Debate on authenticity and authorship ==
=== 1970s and 1980s ===
==== Reception and Smith&#x27;s analysis ====
Among scholars, there is no consensus opinion on the authenticity of the letter, not least because the manuscript&#x27;s ink has never been tested. At the beginning, the authenticity of the letter was not in doubt, and early reviewers of Smith&#x27;s books generally agreed that the letter was genuine. However, soon suspicion arose and the letter achieved notoriety, mainly &quot;because it was intertwined&quot; with Smith&#x27;s own interpretations. Through detailed linguistic investigations, Smith argued that it could likely be a genuine letter of Clement. He indicated that the two quotations go back to an original Aramaic version of Mark, which served as a source for both the canonical Mark and the Gospel of John. Smith argued that the Christian movement began as a mystery religion with baptismal initiation rites, and that the historical Jesus was a magus possessed by the Spirit. Most disturbing to Smith&#x27;s reviewers was his passing suggestion that the baptismal initiation rite administered by Jesus to his disciples may have gone as far as a physical union.

==== Authenticity and authorship ====

In the first phase, the letter was thought to be genuine, while Secret Mark often was regarded as a typical apocryphal second-century gospel sprung from the canonical traditions. This pastiche theory was promoted by F. F. Bruce (1974), who saw the story of the young man of Bethany clumsily based on the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John. Thus, he saw the Secret Mark narrative as derivative and denied that it could be either the source of the story of Lazarus or an independent parallel. Raymond E. Brown (1974) came to the conclusion that the author of Secret Mark &quot;may well have drawn upon&quot; the Gospel of John, &quot;at least from memory&quot;. Patrick W. Skehan (1974) supported this view, calling the reliance on John &quot;unmistakable&quot;. Robert M. Grant (1974) thought that Smith definitely had proved that the letter was written by Clement, but found in Secret Mark elements from each of the four canonical gospels, and arrived at the conclusion that it was written after the first century. Helmut Merkel (1974) also concluded that Secret Mark is dependent on the four canonical gospels after analyzing the key Greek phrases, and that even if the letter is genuine it tells of nothing more than that an expanded version of Mark was in existence in Alexandria in AD 170. Frans Neirynck (1979) argued that Secret Mark was virtually &quot;composed with the assistance of a concordance&quot; of the canonical gospels and wholly dependent on them. N. T. Wright wrote in 1996 that most scholars who accept the text as genuine see in the Secret Gospel of Mark &quot;a considerably later adaptation of Mark in a decidedly gnostic direction.&quot;

However, approximately the same number of scholars (at least 25 versus at least 32) did not consider Secret Mark to be &quot;a worthless patchwork fabrication&quot; but saw instead a healing story quite like other miracle stories in the Synoptic Gospels; a story that progressed smoothly without any obvious rough connections and inconsistencies as is found in the corresponding story of the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John. Like Smith, they mostly thought that the story was based on oral tradition, although they generally rejected his idea of an Aramaic proto-gospel.

==== Quentin Quesnell and Charles Murgia ====
The first scholar to publicly question the letter&#x27;s authenticity was Quentin Quesnell (1927–2012) in 1975. Quesnell&#x27;s principal argument was that the actual manuscript had to be examined before it could be deemed authentic, and he suggested that it might be a modern hoax. He said that the publication of Otto Stählin&#x27;s concordance of Clement in 1936, would make it possible to imitate Clement&#x27;s style, which means that if it is a forgery, it would necessarily have been forged after 1936. On his last day of stay at the monastery, Smith found a catalogue from 1910 in which 191 books were listed, but not the Vossius book. Quesnell and others have argued that this fact supports the supposition that the book never was part of the Mar Saba library, but was brought there from outside, by for example Smith, with the text already inscribed. However, this has been contested. Smith found almost 500 books at his stay, so the list was far from complete and the silence from incomplete catalogues cannot be used as arguments against the existence of a book at the time the catalogue was made, Smith argued.

Although Quesnell did not accuse Smith of having forged the letter, his &quot;hypothetical forger matched Smith&#x27;s apparent ability, opportunity, and motivation,&quot; and readers of the article, as well as Smith himself, saw it as an accusation that Smith was the culprit. Since at the time, no one but Smith had seen the manuscript, some scholars suggested that there might not even be a manuscript.

Charles E. Murgia followed Quesnell&#x27;s allegations of forgery with further arguments, such as calling attention to the fact that the manuscript has no serious scribal errors, as one would expect of an ancient text copied many times, and by suggesting that the text of Clement had been designed as a sphragis, a &quot;seal of authenticity&quot;, to answer questions from the readers why Secret Mark was never heard of before. Murgia found Clement&#x27;s exhortation to Theodore, that he should not concede to the Carpocratians &quot;that the secret Gospel is by Mark, but should even deny it on oath&quot;, to be ludicrous, since there is no point in &quot;urging someone to commit perjury to preserve the secrecy of something which you are in the process of disclosing&quot;. Later Jonathan Klawans, who thinks the letter is suspect but possibly authentic, bolstered Murgia&#x27;s argument by saying that if Clement had urged Theodore to lie to the Carpocratians, it would have been easier for him to follow &quot;his own advice&quot; and lie to Theodore instead. Scott Brown, however, finds this argument to be flawed since there is no point in denying the existence of a gospel that the Carpocratians have in their possession. Brown advocates that Theodore instead is told to assure that the adulterated or forged Carpocratian gospel was not written by Mark, which, according to Brown, would be at least a half-truth and also something Clement could have said for the benefit of the church.

Smith gave some thought to Murgia&#x27;s arguments but later dismissed them as being based on a misreading, and he thought Murgia &quot;fell into a few factual errors&quot;. Although forgers use the technique of &quot;explaining the appearance and vouching for the authenticity&quot;, the same form is also often used to present material hitherto unheard of. Even though none of Clement&#x27;s other letters have survived, there also seems to have been a collection of at least 21 of his letters at Mar Saba in the 8th century when John of Damascus, who worked there for more than 30 years (), quoted from that collection. In the early 18th century, a great fire at Mar Saba also burned out a cave in which many of the oldest manuscripts were stored. Smith speculated that a letter of Clement could partly have survived the fire, and a monk could have copied it into the endpapers of the monastery&#x27;s edition of the letters of Ignatius in order to preserve it. Smith argued that the simplest explanation would be that the text was &quot;copied from a manuscript that had lain for a millennium or more in Mar Saba and had never been heard of because it had never been outside the monastery.&quot;

Murgia anyway ruled out the possibility that Smith could have forged the letter as, according to him, Smith&#x27;s knowledge of Greek was insufficient and nothing in his book indicated a fraud. Murgia seemingly thought the letter was created in the 18th century.

Morton Smith objected to insinuations that he would have forged the letter by, for example, calling Quesnell&#x27;s 1975 article an attack. And when the Swedish historian Per Beskow in &quot;Strange Tales about Jesus&quot; from 1983, the first English edition of his 1979 Swedish book, wrote that there were reasons to be skeptical about the genuineness of the letter, Smith got upset and responded by threatening to sue the English language publisher, Fortress Press of Philadelphia, for $1million dollars. This caused Fortress to withdraw the book from circulation, and a new edition was released in 1985 in which passages that Smith had objected to were removed, and with Beskow emphasizing that he did not accuse Smith of forging it. Although Beskow had doubts about the letter&#x27;s authenticity, he preferred &quot;to regard this as an open question&quot;.

==== Secret Markan priority ====
Morton Smith summarized the situation in a 1982 article. He argued that &quot;most scholars would attribute the letter to Clement&quot; and that no strong argument against it had been presented. The attribution of the gospel to Mark was though &quot;universally rejected&quot;, with the most common opinion being that the gospel is &quot;a pastiche composed from the canonical gospels&quot; in the second century.

After Smith&#x27;s summary of the situation, other scholars did support Secret Markan priority. Ron Cameron (1982) and Helmut Koester (1990) argued that Secret Mark preceded canonical Mark, which in fact would be an abbreviation of Secret Mark. With a few modifications, Hans-Martin Schenke supported Koester&#x27;s theory, and also John Dominic Crossan has presented a to some extent similar &quot;working hypothesis&quot; to that of Koester: &quot;I consider that canonical Mark is a very deliberate revision of &quot;Secret Mark&quot;.&quot; Marvin Meyer included Secret Mark in his reconstruction of the origin of the Gospel of Mark.

=== 1991 (Smith&#x27;s death) to 2005 ===
==== Intensified accusations against Smith ====
The allegations against Smith for having forged the Mar Saba manuscript became even more pronounced after his death in 1991. Jacob Neusner, a specialist in ancient Judaism, was Morton Smith&#x27;s student and admirer but later, in 1984, there was a public falling out between them after Smith publicly denounced his former student&#x27;s academic competence. Neusner subsequently described Secret Mark as &quot;the forgery of the century&quot;. Yet Neusner never wrote any detailed analysis of Secret Mark or an explanation of why he thought it was a forgery.

==== The language and style of the Clement letter ====
Most scholars who have studied the letter and written about it assume the letter was written by Clement. Most patristic scholars think the language is typical of Clement and that in manner and matter the letter seems to have been written by him. In &quot;the first epistolary analysis of Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore&quot;, Jeff Jay demonstrates that the letter &quot;comports in form, content, and function with other ancient letters that addressed similar circumstances&quot;, and &quot;is plausible in light of letter writing in the late second or early third century&quot;. He claims that it would require a forger with a breadth of knowledge that is &quot;superhuman&quot; to have forged the letter. In the main, the Clementine scholars have accepted the authenticity of the letter, and in 1980 it was also included in the concordance of the acknowledged genuine writings of Clement, although the inclusion is said by the editor Ursula Treu to be provisional.
In 1995, Andrew H. Criddle made a statistical study of Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore with the help of Otto Stählin&#x27;s concordance of the writings of Clement. According to Criddle, the letter had too many hapax legomena, words used only once before by Clement, in comparison to words never before used by Clement, and Criddle argued that this indicates that a forger had &quot;brought together more rare words and phrases&quot; found in the authentic writings of Clement than Clement would have used. The study has been criticized for, among other things, focusing on &quot;Clement&#x27;s least favourite words&quot; and for the methodology itself, which turns out to be &quot;unreliable in determining authorship&quot;. When tested on Shakespeare&#x27;s writings only three out of seven poems were correctly identified.

==== &quot;The Mystery of Mar Saba&quot; ====
In 2001, Philip Jenkins drew attention to a novel by James H. Hunter entitled &quot;The Mystery of Mar Saba&quot;, which first appeared in 1940 and was popular at the time. Jenkins saw unusual parallels to Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore and Smith&#x27;s description of his discovery in 1958, but did not explicitly state that the novel inspired Smith to forge the text. Later Robert M. Price, Francis Watson and Craig A. Evans developed the theory that Morton Smith would have been inspired by this novel to forge the letter. This assumption has been contested by, among others, Scott G. Brown, who writes that apart from &quot;a scholar discovering a previously unknown ancient Christian manuscript at Mar Saba, there are few parallels&quot; – and in a rebuttal to Evans, he and Allan J. Pantuck find the alleged parallel between the Scotland Yard detective Lord Moreton&#x27;s last name and Morton Smith&#x27;s first name puzzling, since Morton Smith got his name long before the novel was written. Francis Watson finds the parallels so convincing that &quot;the question of dependence is unavoidable&quot;, while Allan J. Pantuck thinks they are too generic or too artful to be persuasive. Javier Martínez, who thinks the question of forgery is open to debate, regards the suggestion that Hunter&#x27;s novel would have inspired Smith to forge the text to be outlandish. He wonders why it took more than four decades after the story of Smith&#x27;s discovery made the front page of the &quot;New York Times&quot; before anyone realized that this so popular novel was Smith&#x27;s source. Martínez finds Watson&#x27;s methods, by which he reaches the conclusion that &quot;[t]here is no alternative but to conclude that Smith is dependent on&quot; &quot;The Mystery of Mar Saba&quot;, to be &quot;surreal as a work of scholarship&quot;. Timo Paananen asserts that neither Evans nor Watson clarifies what criteria they use to establish that these particular parallels are so &quot;amazing, both in substance and in language&quot;, and that they reduce the rigor of their criteria compared to how they dismiss &quot;literary dependencies in other context&quot;.

==== Chiasms in Mark ====
In 2003, John Dart proposed a complex theory of &#x27;chiasms&#x27; (or &#x27;chiasmus&#x27;) running through the Gospel of Mark – a type of literary device he finds in the text. Dart &quot;[recovered] a formal structure to original Mark containing five major chiastic spans framed by a prologue and a conclusion.&quot; According to Dart, his analysis supports the authenticity of Secret Mark. His theory has been criticized, as it presupposes hypothetical changes in the text of Mark in order to work.

==== Stalemate in the academy ====
The fact that, for many years, no other scholars besides Smith were known to have seen the manuscript contributed to the suspicions of forgery. This dissipated with the publication of color photographs in 2000, and the revelation in 2003 that Guy Stroumsa and several others viewed the manuscript in 1976. In response to the idea that Smith had kept other scholars from inspecting the manuscript, Scott G. Brown noted that he was in no position to do so. The manuscript was still where Smith had left it when Stroumsa and company found it 18 years later, and it did not disappear until many years after its relocation to Jerusalem and its separation from the book. Charles Hedrick says that if anyone is to be blamed for the loss of the manuscript, it is the &quot;[o]fficials of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem&quot;, as it was lost while it was in their custody.

In 2003 Charles Hedrick expressed frustration over the stalemate in the academy over the text&#x27;s authenticity, even though the Clementine scholars in the main had accepted the authenticity of the letter. The same year, Bart Ehrman also stated that the situation still was the same as it was when Smith summarized it in 1982, namely that a majority of scholars considered the letter to be authentic, &quot;and probably a somewhat smaller majority agreed that the quotations of Secret Mark actually derived from a version of Mark.&quot;

The two camps could be illustrated, on the one hand by Larry Hurtado, who thinks it is &quot;inadvisable to rest too much on Secret Mark&quot; as the letter &quot;that quotes it might be a forgery&quot; and even if it is genuine, Secret Mark &quot;may be at most an ancient but secondary edition of Mark produced in the second century by some group seeking to promote its own esoteric interests&quot;, and by Francis Watson, who hopes and expects that Secret Mark will be increasingly ignored by scholars to avoid &quot;that their work will be corrupted by association with it&quot;. On the other hand, by Marvin Meyer, who assumes the letter to be authentic and in several articles, beginning in 1983, used Secret Mark in his reconstructions, especially regarding the young man () &quot;as a model of discipleship&quot;, and by Eckhard Rau, who argues that as long as a physical examination of the manuscript is not possible and no new arguments against authenticity can be put forward, it is, although not without risk, judicious to interpret the text as originating from the circle of Clement of Alexandria.

Other authors, like an Origenist monk in the early 5th century, have also been proposed for the letter. Michael Zeddies suggested in 2017 that the letter was actually written by Origen of Alexandria (–). The author of the letter is identified only in the title and many ancient writings were misattributed. According to Zeddies, the language of the letter, its concept and style, as well as its setting, &quot;are at least as Origenian as they are Clementine&quot;. Origen was also influenced by Clement and &quot;shared his background in the Alexandrian church&quot;. Furthermore, Origen actually had a pupil named Theodore.

=== 2005 to present ===
The debate intensified with the publication of three new books. Scott G. Brown&#x27;s revised doctoral dissertation &quot;Mark&#x27;s Other Gospel&quot; from 2005, was the first monograph that dealt only with Secret Mark since Smith&#x27;s books in 1973. Brown argued that both the letter and Secret Mark were authentic. The same year Stephen C. Carlson published &quot;The Gospel Hoax&quot; in which he spells out his case that Morton Smith, himself, was both the author and the scribe of the Mar Saba manuscript. And in 2007, musicologist Peter Jeffery published &quot;The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled&quot;, in which he accuses Morton Smith of having forged the letter.

==== &quot;Mark&#x27;s Other Gospel&quot; ====
In &quot;Mark&#x27;s Other Gospel&quot; (2005), Scott G. Brown challenged &quot;all previous statements and arguments made against the letter&#x27;s authenticity&quot; and he criticized those scholars saying that the letter was forged for not offering proof for their claims, and for not making a distinction between the letter and Smith&#x27;s own interpretation of it. Brown claimed that Smith could not have forged the letter since he did not comprehend it &quot;well enough to have composed it.&quot; Brown also criticized the pastiche theory, according to which Secret Mark would be created from a patchwork of phrases from especially the Synoptic Gospels, for being speculative, uncontrollable and &quot;unrealistically complicated&quot;. Most parallels between Secret Mark and Matthew and Luke are, according to Brown, &quot;vague, trivial, or formulaic&quot;. The only close parallels are to canonical Mark, but a characteristic of Mark is &quot;repetition of exact phrases&quot;, and Brown finds nothing suspicious in the fact that a longer version of the Gospel of Mark contains &quot;Markan phrases and story elements&quot;. He also explored several Markan literary characteristics in Secret Mark, such as verbal echoes, intercalations and framing stories, and came to the conclusion that the author of the Secret Gospel of Mark &quot;wrote so much like Mark that he could very well be Mark himself&quot;, that is, whoever &quot;wrote the canonical gospel.&quot;

==== &quot;The Gospel Hoax&quot; ====
In &quot;The Gospel Hoax&quot; (2005), Stephen C. Carlson argued that Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore is a forgery and only Morton Smith could have forged it, as he had the &quot;means, motive, and opportunity&quot; to do so. Carlson claimed to have identified concealed jokes left by Smith in the letter which according to him showed that Smith created the letter as a hoax. He especially identified two: the first, a reference to salt that &quot;loses its savor&quot;, according to Carlson by being mixed with an adulterant, and that presupposes free-flowing salt which in turn is produced with the help of an anti-caking agent, &quot;a modern invention&quot; by an employee of the Salt Company – a clue left by Smith pointing to himself; and the second, that Smith would have identified the handwriting of the Clement letter as done by himself in the 20th century &quot;by forging the same eighteenth-century handwriting in another book and falsely attributing that writing to a pseudonymous twentieth-century individual named M. Madiotes [], whose name is a cipher pointing to Smith himself.&quot; The &#x27;M&#x27; would stand for Morton, and &#x27;Madiotes&#x27; would be derived from the Greek verb meaning both &#x27;to lose hair&#x27; and figuratively &#x27;to swindle&#x27; – with the bald swindler being the balding Morton Smith. When Carlson examined the printed reproductions of the letter found in Smith&#x27;s scholarly book, he said he noted a &quot;forger&#x27;s tremor.&quot; Thus, according to Carlson the letters had not actually been written at all, but drawn with shaky pen lines and with lifts of the pen in the middle of strokes. Many scholars became convinced by Carlson&#x27;s book that the letter was a modern forgery and some who previously defended Smith changed their position. Craig A. Evans, for instance, came to think that &quot;the Clementine letter and the quotations of Secret Mark embedded within it constitute a modern hoax, and Morton Smith almost certainly is the hoaxer.&quot;

However, these theories by Carlson have, in their own turn, been challenged by subsequent scholarly research, especially by Scott G. Brown in numerous articles. Brown writes that Carlson&#x27;s Morton Salt Company clue &quot;is one long sequence of mistakes&quot; and that &quot;the letter nowhere refers to salt being mixed with anything&quot; – only &quot;the true things&quot; are mixed. He also says that salt can be mixed without being free-flowing with the help of mortar and pestle, an objection that gets support from Kyle Smith, who shows that according to ancient sources salt both could be and was &quot;mixed and adulterated&quot;. Having gained access to the original uncropped photograph, Allan Pantuck and Scott Brown also demonstrated that the script Carlson thought was written by M. Madiotes actually was written by someone else and was an 18th-century hand unrelated to Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore; that Smith did not attribute that handwriting to a contemporary named &quot;M. Madiotes&quot; (), and that he afterwards corrected the name &quot;Madiotes&quot; to &quot;Madeotas&quot; () which may, in fact, be &quot;Modestos&quot; (), a common name at Mar Saba.

In particular, on the subject of the handwriting, Roger Viklund in collaboration with Timo S. Paananen has demonstrated that &quot;all the signs of forgery Carlson unearthed in his analysis of the handwriting&quot;, such as a &quot;forger&#x27;s tremor&quot;, are only visible in the images Carlson used for his handwriting analysis. Carlson chose &quot;to use the halftone reproductions found in [Smith&#x27;s book] &quot;Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;&quot; where the images were printed with a line screen made of dots. If the &quot;images are magnified to the degree necessary for forensic document examination&quot; the dot matrix will be visible and the letters &quot;will not appear smooth&quot;. Once the printed images Carlson used were replaced with the original photographs, the signs of tremors also disappeared.

On the first York Christian Apocrypha Symposium on the Secret Gospel of Mark held in Canada in 2011, very little of Carlson&#x27;s evidence was discussed. Even Pierluigi Piovanelli – who thinks Smith committed a sophisticated forgery – writes that the fact that &quot;the majority of Carlson&#x27;s claims&quot; have been convincingly dismissed by Brown and Pantuck and that no &quot;clearly identifiable &#x27;joke is embedded within the letter, &quot;tend to militate against Carlson&#x27;s overly simplistic hypothesis of a hoax.&quot;

==== &quot;The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled&quot; ====
In &quot;The Secret Gospel of Mark Unveiled&quot; (2007), Peter Jeffery argued that &quot;the letter reflected practices and theories of the twentieth century, not the second&quot;, and that Smith wrote Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore with the purpose of creating &quot;the impression that Jesus practiced homosexuality&quot;. Jeffery reads the Secret Mark story as an extended double entendre that tells &quot;a tale of &#x27;sexual preference&#x27; that could only have been told by a twentieth-century Western author&quot; who inhabited &quot;a homoerotic subculture in English universities&quot;. Jeffery&#x27;s thesis has been contested by, for example, Scott G. Brown and William V. Harris. Jeffery&#x27;s two main arguments, those concerning liturgy and homoeroticism, are according to Harris unproductive and he writes that Jeffery &quot;confuses the question of the authenticity of the text and the validity of Smith&#x27;s interpretations&quot; by attacking Smith and his interpretation and not Secret Mark. The homoerotic argument, according to which Smith would have written the document to portray Jesus as practicing homosexuality, does not work either. In his two books on Secret Mark, Smith &quot;gives barely six lines to the subject&quot;. Jeffery&#x27;s conclusion that the document is a forgery &quot;because no young Judaean man&quot; would approach &quot;an older man for sex&quot; is according to Harris also invalid, since there is &quot;no such statement&quot; in Secret Mark.

==== Smith&#x27;s correspondence ====
In 2008, extensive correspondence between Smith and his teacher and lifelong friend Gershom Scholem was published, where they for decades discuss Clement&#x27;s letter to Theodore and Secret Mark. The book&#x27;s editor, Guy Stroumsa, argues that the &quot;correspondence should provide sufficient evidence of his [i.e., Smith&#x27;s] intellectual honesty to anyone armed with common sense and lacking malice.&quot; He thinks it shows &quot;Smith&#x27;s honesty&quot;, and that Smith could not have forged the Clement letter, for, in the words of Anthony Grafton, the &quot;letters show him discussing the material with Scholem, over time, in ways that clearly reflect a process of discovery and reflection.&quot; Pierluigi Piovanelli has however contested Stroumsa&#x27;s interpretation. He believes that the correspondence shows that Smith created an &quot;extremely sophisticated forgery&quot; to promote ideas he already held about Jesus as a magician. Jonathan Klawans does not find the letters to be sufficiently revealing, and on methodological grounds, he thinks that letters written by Smith cannot give a definite answer to the question of authenticity.

==== Smith&#x27;s beforehand knowledge ====
A number of scholars have argued that the salient elements of Secret Mark were themes of interest to Smith which he had studied before the discovery of the letter in 1958. In other words, Smith would have forged a letter that supported ideas he already embraced. Pierluigi Piovanelli is suspicious about the letter&#x27;s authenticity as he thinks it is &quot;the wrong document, at the wrong place, discovered by the wrong person, who was, moreover, in need of exactly that kind of new evidence to promote new, unconventional ideas&quot;. Craig Evans argues that Smith before the discovery had published three studies, in 1951, 1955 and 1958, in which he discussed and linked &quot;(1) &quot;the mystery of the kingdom of God&quot; in Mark 4:11, (2) secrecy and initiation, (3) forbidden sexual, including homosexual, relationships and (4) Clement of Alexandria&quot;.

This hypothesis has been contested mainly by Brown and Pantuck. First, they reject the idea that something sexual is even said to take place between Jesus and the young man in Secret Mark, and if that is the case, then there are no forbidden sexual relations in the Secret Mark story. Second, they challenge the idea that Smith made the links Evans and others claim he did. They argue that Smith, in his doctoral dissertation from 1951, did not link more than two of the elements – the mystery of the kingdom of God to secret teachings. Forbidden sexual relations, such as &quot;incest, intercourse during menstruation, adultery, homosexuality, and bestiality&quot;, is just one subject among several others in the scriptures that the Tannaim deemed should be discussed in secret. Further, they claim that Smith in his 1955 article also only linked the mystery of the kingdom of God to secret teachings. In the third example, an article Smith wrote in 1958, he only &quot;mentioned Clement and his &quot;Stromateis&quot; as examples of secret teaching&quot;. Brown and Pantuck consider it to be common knowledge among scholars of Christianity and Judaism that Clement and Mark 4:11 deal with secret teaching.

==== Handwriting experts and Smith&#x27;s ability ====
The November/December 2009 issue of &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; (BAR 35:06) features a selection of articles dedicated to the Secret Gospel of Mark. Charles W. Hedrick wrote an introduction to the subject, and both Hershel Shanks and Helmut Koester wrote articles in support of the letter&#x27;s authenticity. Since the three pro-forgery scholars who were contacted declined to participate, Shanks had to make the argument for forgery himself. Helmut Koester writes that Morton Smith &quot;was not a good form-critical scholar&quot; and that it &quot;would have been completely beyond his ability to forge a text that, in terms of form-criticism, is a perfect older form of the same story as appears in &quot;John 11&quot; as the raising of Lazarus.&quot; In 1963 Koester and Smith met several hours a day for a week to discuss Secret Mark. Koester then realized that Smith really struggled to understand the text and to decipher the handwriting. Koester writes: &quot;Obviously, a forger would not have had the problems that Morton was struggling with. Or Morton Smith was an accomplished actor and I a complete fool.&quot;

In late 2009, &quot;Biblical Archaeology Review&quot; commissioned two Greek handwriting experts to evaluate &quot;whether the handwriting of the Clement letter is in an authentic 18th-century Greek script&quot; and whether Morton Smith could have written it. They had at their disposal high-resolution scans of the photographs of the Clement letter and known samples of Morton Smith&#x27;s English and Greek handwriting from 1951 to 1984.

Venetia Anastasopoulou, a questioned document examiner and expert witness with experience in many Greek court cases, noticed three very different writings. Clement&#x27;s letter, in her opinion, was written skillfully with &quot;freedom, spontaneity and artistic flair&quot; by a trained scribe who could effectively express his thoughts. Likewise, Smith&#x27;s English writing was &quot;spontaneous and unconstrained, with a very good rhythm.&quot; Smith&#x27;s Greek writing, though, was &quot;like that of a school student&quot; who is unfamiliarized in Greek writing and unable &quot;to use it freely&quot; with ease. Anastasopoulou concluded that in her professional opinion, Morton Smith, with high probability, could not have produced the handwriting of the Clement letter. She further explained, contrary to Carlson&#x27;s assertion, that the letter did not have any of the typical signs of forgery, such as &quot;lack of natural variations&quot; appearing to be drawn or having &quot;poor line quality&quot;, and that when a large document, such as this letter by Clement, is consistent throughout, &quot;we have a first indication of genuineness&quot;.

However, Agamemnon Tselikas, a distinguished Greek paleographer and thus a specialist in deciding when a particular text was written and in what school this way of writing was taught, thought the letter was a forgery. He noticed some letters with &quot;completely foreign or strange and irregular forms&quot;. Contrary to Anastasopoulou&#x27;s judgment, he thought some lines were non-continuous and that the hand of the scribe was not moving spontaneously. He stated that the handwriting of the letter is an imitation of 18th-century Greek script and that the most likely forger was either Smith or someone in Smith&#x27;s employ. Tselikas suggests that Smith, as a model for the handwriting, could have used four 18th-century manuscripts from the Thematon monastery he visited in 1951. Allan Pantuck could, though, demonstrate that Smith never took any photographs of these manuscripts and could consequently not have used them as models. Since, according to Anastasopoulou&#x27;s conclusion, the letter is written by a trained scribe with a skill that surpasses Smith&#x27;s ability, in the words of Michael Kok, &quot;the conspiracy theory must grow to include an accomplice with training in eighteenth-century Greek paleography&quot;.

Having surveyed the archives of Smith&#x27;s papers and correspondence, Pantuck comes to the conclusion that Smith was not capable of forging the letter; that his Greek was not good enough to compose a letter in Clement&#x27;s thought and style and that he lacked the skills needed to imitate a difficult Greek 18th-century handwriting. Roy Kotansky, who worked with Smith on translating Greek, says that although Smith&#x27;s Greek was very good, it &quot;was not that of a true papyrologist (or philologist)&quot;. According to Kotansky, Smith &quot;certainly could not have produced either the Greek cursive script of the Mar Saba manuscript, nor its grammatical text&quot; and writes that few are &quot;up to this sort of task&quot;; which, if the letter is forged, would be &quot;one of the greatest works of scholarship of the twentieth century&quot;, according to Bart Ehrman.

Scott G. Brown and Eckhard Rau argue that Smith&#x27;s interpretation of the longer passage from Secret Mark cannot be reconciled with its content, and Rau thinks that if Smith really forged the letter, he should have been able to make it more suitable for his own theories. Michael Kok thinks that the &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel of the forgery hypothesis&quot; is that Smith seemingly did not have the necessary skills to forge the letter.

==== &quot;The Secret Gospel of Mark&quot; ====
In &quot;The Secret Gospel of Mark,&quot; historians Geoffrey Smith and Brent Landau propose an interpretation that goes against both major camps in the dispute. They do not believe that the Mar Saba letter was forged by Smith; based on existing handwriting analysis plus further analysis from experts they sought out themselves, they assert that the version of the letter found by Smith was most likely transcribed during the 18th or early 19th centuries, and agree with those who feel Smith did not have the skills necessary to either compose the letter&#x27;s contents or simulate handwriting from those dates.

However, they also, based on internal evidence, reject the possibility that the document was genuinely written by Clement of Alexandria. The most important piece of evidence is that the letter writer takes for granted that Mark the Evangelist was the first bishop of Alexandria. Before the publication of the Mar Saba letter, the oldest evidence for this belief in Christian circles came from the 4th century &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; written by Eusebius; beyond the contents of Secret Mark itself, one of the features of the Mar Saba letter of most interest to historians is that it would be very early evidence of belief that Mark had been bishop of Alexandria. However, Smith and Landau point out that Clement never identifies Mark as one of his predecessors in the see in any of his confirmed writings, even ones in which he discusses Mark the Evangelist&#x27;s career, and so they reject the idea that Clement held this belief. Other material in the letter is similarly anachronistic, and appears to have been written by someone working from Eusebius, who wrote nearly a century after Clement&#x27;s death. In particular, they believe the material in the letter about the Carpocratians is much more similar to Eusebius&#x27;s account of the group than it is to writings about them in Clement&#x27;s confirmed works.

Smith and Landau believe the letter to be a pseudepigraphal composition from late antiquity. They note that Morton Smith shared the letter with his mentor Arthur Nock before publication, and Nock came to that conclusion upon reading it. Geoffrey Smith and Landau believe the letter was composed in the context of a late antique controversy raging in Palestinian monasteries like Mar Saba over adelphopoiesis, or &quot;brother-making,&quot; a ceremony which recognized an intense emotional and spiritual relationship (not necessarily erotic, though sometimes viewed as such by contemporaries and modern observers) between two monks. The authors believe the letter is an attempt to defend the practice by connecting it to Jesus&#x27;s ministry, drawing from canonical biblical episodes such as Jesus&#x27;s resurrection of Lazarus and the mysterious naked fugitive fleeing the scene of Jesus&#x27;s arrest.

== Interpretation ==
=== Smith&#x27;s theories about the historical Jesus ===
Smith thought that the scene in which Jesus taught the young man &quot;the mystery of the kingdom of God&quot; at night, depicted an initiation rite of baptism which Jesus offered his closest disciples. In this baptismal rite &quot;the initiate united with Jesus&#x27; spirit&quot; in a hallucinatory experience, and then they &quot;ascended mystically to the heavens.&quot; The disciple would be set free from the Mosaic Law and they would both become libertines. The libertinism of Jesus was then later suppressed by James, the brother of Jesus, and Paul. The idea that &quot;Jesus was a libertine who performed a hypnotic rite of&quot; illusory ascent to the heavens, not only seemed far-fetched but also upset many scholars, who could not envision that Jesus would be portrayed in such a way in a trustworthy ancient text. Scott Brown argues though that Smith&#x27;s usage of the term libertine did not mean sexual libertinism, but freethinking in matters of religion, and that it refers to Jews and Christians who chose not to keep the Mosaic Law. In each of his books on Secret Mark, Smith made one passing suggestion that Jesus and the disciples might have united also physically in this rite, but he thought that the essential thing was that the disciples were possessed by Jesus&#x27; spirit&quot;. Smith acknowledged that there is no way to know if this libertinism can be traced as far back as Jesus.

In his later work, Morton Smith increasingly came to see the historical Jesus as practicing some type of magical rituals and hypnotism, thus explaining various healings of demoniacs in the gospels. Smith carefully explored for any traces of a &quot;libertine tradition&quot; in early Christianity and in the New Testament. Yet there is very little in the Mar Saba manuscript to give backing to any of this. This is illustrated by the fact that in his later book, &quot;Jesus the Magician&quot;, Smith devoted only 12 lines to the Mar Saba manuscript, and never suggested &quot;that Jesus engaged in sexual libertinism&quot;.

=== Lacunae and continuity ===
The two excerpts from Secret Mark suggest resolutions to some puzzling passages in the canonical Mark.

==== The young man in the linen cloth ====
In Mark 14:51–52, a young man (Greek: νεανίσκος, &quot;neaniskos&quot;) in a linen cloth (Greek: σινδόνα, &quot;sindona&quot;) is seized during Jesus&#x27; arrest, but he escapes at the cost of his clothing. This passage seems to have little to do with the rest of the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Sometimes it is suggested that the young man is Mark himself. However, the same Greek words (&quot;neaniskos&quot; and &quot;sindona&quot;) are also used in Secret Mark. Several scholars, such as Robert Grant and Robert Gundry, suggest that Secret Mark was created based on Mark 14:51, 16:5 and other passages and that this would explain the similarities. Other scholars, such as Helmut Koester and J. D. Crossan, argue that the canonical Mark is a revision of Secret Mark. Koester thinks that an original Proto-Mark was expanded with, among other things, the raising of the youth in Secret Mark and the fleeing naked youth during Jesus&#x27; arrest in Mark 14:51–52, and that this gospel version later was abridged to form the canonical Mark. According to Crossan, Secret Mark was the original gospel. In the creation of canonical Mark, the two Secret Mark passages quoted by Clement were removed and then dismembered and scattered throughout canonical Mark to form the &quot;neaniskos&quot;-passages. Miles Fowler and others argue that Secret Mark originally told a coherent story, including that of a young man. From this gospel, some passages were removed (by the original author or by someone else) to form canonical Mark. In this process, some remnants were left, such as that of the fleeing naked young man, while other passages may have been completely lost.

Marvin Meyer sees the young man in Secret Mark as a paradigmatic disciple that &quot;functions as a literary rather than a historical figure.&quot; The young man (&quot;neaniskos&quot;) wears only &quot;a linen cloth&quot; (&quot;sindona&quot;) &quot;over his naked body&quot;. This is reminiscent of Mark 14:51–52, where, in the garden of Gethsemane, an unnamed young man (&quot;neaniskos&quot;) who is wearing nothing but a linen cloth (&quot;sindona&quot;) about his body is said to follow Jesus, and as they seize him, he runs away naked, leaving his linen cloth behind. The word &quot;sindōn&quot; is also found in Mark 15:46 where it refers to Jesus&#x27; burial wrapping. And in Mark 16:5 a &quot;neaniskos&quot; (young man) in a white robe, who in Mark does not seem to function as an angel, is sitting in the empty tomb when the women arrive to anoint Jesus&#x27; body.

Miles Fowler suggests that the naked fleeing youth in Mark 14:51–52, the youth in the tomb of Jesus in Mark 16:5 and the youth Jesus raises from the dead in Secret Mark are the same youth; but that he also appears as the rich (and in the parallel account in Matthew 19:20, &quot;young&quot;) man in Mark 10:17–22, whom Jesus loves and urges to give all his possessions to the poor and join him. This young man is furthermore by some scholars identified as both Lazarus (due to the similarities between Secret Mark 1 and John 11) and the beloved disciple (due to the fact that Jesus in Secret Mark 2 is said to have loved the youth, and that in the gospels he is said to have loved only the three siblings Martha, Mary and Lazarus (John 11:5), the rich man (Mark 10:22) and the beloved disciple). Hans-Martin Schenke interprets the scene of the fleeing youth in Gethsemane (Mark 14:51–52) as a symbolic story in which the youth is not human but rather a shadow, a symbol, an ideal disciple. He sees the reappearing youth as a spiritual double of Jesus and the stripping of the body as a symbol of the soul being naked.
Marvin Meyer finds a subplot, or scenes or vignettes, &quot;in &quot;Secret Mark&quot; that is present in only a truncated form in canonical Mark&quot;, about a young man as a symbol of discipleship who follows Jesus throughout the gospel story. The first trace of this young man is found in the story of the rich man in Mark 10:17–22 whom Jesus loves and &quot;who is a candidate for discipleship&quot;; the second is the story of the young man in the first Secret Mark passage (after Mark 10:34) whom Jesus raises from the dead and teaches the mystery of the kingdom of God and who loves Jesus; the third is found in the second Secret Mark passage (at Mark 10:46) in which Jesus rejects Salome and the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother; the fourth is in the story of the escaping naked young man in Gethsemane (Mark 14:51–52); and the fifth is found in the story of the young man in a white robe inside the empty tomb, a youth who informs Salome and the other women that Jesus has risen (Mark 16:1–8). In this scenario, a once-coherent story in Secret Mark would, after much of the elements had been removed, form an incoherent story in canonical Mark with only embedded echoes of the story present.

==== Lacuna in the trip to Jericho ====
The second excerpt from Secret Mark fills in an apparent lacuna in Mark 10:46: &quot;They came to Jericho. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the roadside.&quot; Morton Smith notes that &quot;one of Mark&#x27;s favorite formulas&quot; is to say that Jesus comes to a certain place, but &quot;in all of these except Mark 3:20 and 10:46 it is followed by an account of some event which occurred in the place entered&quot; before he leaves the place. Due to this apparent gap in the story, there has been speculation that the information about what happened in Jericho has been omitted. According to Robert Gundry, the fact that Jesus cures the blind Bartimaeus on the way from Jericho justifies that Mark said that Jesus came to Jericho without saying that he did anything there. As a parallel, Gundry refers to Mark 7:31 where Jesus &quot;returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee&quot;. However, here Jesus is never said to have entered Sidon, and it is possible that this is an amalgamation of several introductory notices.

With the addition from Secret Mark, the gap in the story would be solved: &quot;They came to Jericho, and the sister of the youth whom Jesus loved and his mother and Salome were there, and Jesus did not receive them. As he and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho ...&quot; The fact that the text becomes more comprehensible with the addition from Secret Mark, plus the fact that Salome is mentioned (and since she was &quot;popular in heretical circles&quot;, the sentence could have been abbreviated for that reason), indicates that Secret Mark has preserved a reading that was deleted in the canonical Gospel of Mark. Crossan thinks this shows that &quot;Mark 10:46 is a condensed and dependent version of&quot; the Secret Mark sentence. Others argue that it would be expected that someone later would want to fill in the obvious gaps that occur in the Gospel of Mark.

=== Relation to the Gospel of John ===
==== The raising of Lazarus in John and the young man in Secret Mark ====
The resurrection of the young man by Jesus in Secret Mark bears such clear similarities to the raising of Lazarus in the Gospel of John (11:1–44) that it can be seen as another version of that story. But although there are striking parallels between these two stories, there are also &quot;numerous, often pointless, contradictions.&quot; If the two verses in Mark preceding Secret Mark are included, both stories tell us that the disciples are apprehensive as they fear Jesus&#x27; arrest. In each story it is the sister whose brother just died who approaches Jesus on the road and asks his help; she shows Jesus the tomb, which is in Bethany; the stone is removed, and Jesus raises the dead man who then comes out of the tomb. In each story, the emphasis is upon the love between Jesus and this man, and eventually, Jesus follows him to his home. Each story occurs &quot;at the same period in Jesus&#x27; career&quot;, as he has left Galilee and gone into Judea and then to Transjordan.

==== Jesus&#x27; route in Mark ====
With the quoted Secret Mark passages added to the Gospel of Mark, a story emerges in which Jesus on his way to Jerusalem leaves Galilee and walks into northern
Judea, then crosses the Jordan River east into Peraea and walks south through Peraea on the eastern side of the Jordan, meets the rich man whom he urges to give all his possessions to the poor and follow him (Mark 10:17–22), comes to Bethany, still on the other side of Jordan, and raises the young man from the dead (Secret Mark 1). He then crosses the river Jordan again and continues west while rejecting James&#x27; and John&#x27;s request (Mark 10:35–45). He arrives at Jericho where he does not receive the three women (Mark 10:46 + Secret Mark 2) and then leaves Jericho to meet the blind Bartimaeus and give him back his sight.

==== Two Bethanys ====
In each story, the raising of the dead man takes place in Bethany. In the Gospel of John (10:40) Jesus is at &quot;the place where John had been baptizing&quot;, which in John 1:28 is said to be a place named &quot;Bethany beyond the Jordan&quot; when Mary arrives and tells him that Lazarus is sick (John 11:1–3). Jesus follows her to another village called Bethany just outside of Jerusalem (John 11:17–18). In Secret Mark, the woman meets him at the same place, but he never travels to Bethany near Jerusalem. Instead, he just follows her to the young man since he already is in Bethany (beyond the Jordan). In Secret Mark, the young man (Lazarus?) and his sister (Mary?) are not named, and their sister Martha does not even appear.

==== Relations between the gospels ====
A number of scholars argue that the story in Secret Mark is based on the Gospel of John. Other scholars argue that the authors of Secret Mark and the Gospel of John independently used a common source or built on a common tradition. The fact that Secret Mark refers to another Bethany than the one in the Gospel of John as the place for the miracle and omits the names of the protagonists, and since there are no traces in Secret Mark of the rather extensive Johannine redaction, or of other Johannine characteristics, including its language, militate against Secret Mark being based on the Gospel of John. Michael Kok thinks that this also militates against the thesis that the Gospel of John depends on Secret Mark and that it indicates that they both are based either on &quot;oral variants of the same underlying tradition&quot;, or on older written collections of miracle stories. Koester thinks Secret Mark represents an earlier stage of development of the story. Morton Smith tried to demonstrate that the resurrection story in Secret Mark does not contain any of the secondary traits found in the parallel story in John 11 and that the story in John 11 is more theologically developed. He concluded that the Secret Mark version of the story contains an older, independent, and more reliable witness to the oral tradition.

=== Baptismal significance ===
Morton Smith saw the longer Secret Mark passage as a story of baptism. According to Smith &quot;the mystery of the kingdom of God&quot; that Jesus taught the young man, was, in fact, a magical rite that &quot;involved a purificatory baptism&quot;. That this story depicts a baptism was in turn accepted by most scholars, also those otherwise critical to Smith&#x27;s reconstructions. And with the idea of the linen sheet as a baptismal garment followed the idea of nakedness and sex.

But there has been some debate about this matter. For example, Scott G. Brown (while defending the authenticity of Secret Mark) disagrees with Smith that the scene is a reference to baptism. He thinks this is to profoundly misinterpret the text, and he argues that if the story really had been about baptism, it would not have mentioned only teaching, but also water or disrobing and immersion. He adds that &quot;the young man&#x27;s linen sheet has baptismal connotations, but the text discourages every attempt to perceive Jesus literally baptizing him.&quot; Stephen Carlson agrees that Brown&#x27;s reading is more plausible than Smith&#x27;s. The idea that Jesus practiced baptism is absent from the Synoptic Gospels, though it is introduced in the Gospel of John.

Brown argues that Clement, with the expression &quot;the mystery of the kingdom of God,&quot; primarily meant &quot;advanced theological instruction.&quot; On the other three occasions when Clement refers to &quot;initiation in the great mysteries&quot;, he always refers to the &quot;highest stage of Christian theological education, two stages beyond baptism&quot; – a philosophical, intellectual and spiritual experience &quot;beyond the material realm&quot;. Brown thinks the story of the young man is best understood symbolically, and the young man is best seen as an abstract symbol of &quot;discipleship as a process of following Jesus in the way to life through death&quot;.
These matters also have a bearing on the debates about the authenticity of Secret Mark, because Brown implies that Smith, himself, did not quite understand his own discovery and it would be illogical to forge a text that you do not understand, to prove a theory it does not support.

<text>Allan Ralph Rogers (24 October 1932 – 28 November 2023) was a British Labour Party politician. He was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East Wales from 1979 to 1984, and Member of Parliament (MP) for Rhondda in Wales from 1983 until he stepped down at the 2001 general election.

==Background==
Rogers was born in Gelligaer in 1932, the youngest of twelve children. He had a scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge, but was unable to take it up when his national service deferment papers were &#x27;mislaid&#x27;. He performed his national service with the Royal Welch Fusiliers, and studied geology at Swansea University. He subsequently worked as a geologist in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, and Australia, before becoming a teacher. 

After a successful career as a geologist, he found himself as an educator, first at secondary level and then in adult education. Later, alongside fellow WEA tutor organiser, Neil Kinnock, he introduced adult education classes for the workers at Switchgear. He also introduced art classes in mental health facilities. During his time as an MP, he also taught at the University of Glamorgan.

==Politics==
Rogers was elected to the Gelligaer District Council in 1965, and then to the Glamorgan County Council in 1970, which was replaced in part by the Mid Glamorgan County Council in 1974. In 1979, he was elected to the European Parliament. He was one of the Vice Presidents of the European Parliament from July 1979 to January 1982.

=== Parliamentary career ===
Rogers was elected the Member of Parliament for Rhondda in 1983. During his time as an MP, he served on the Welsh Affairs Committee, Public Accounts Committee and the European Scrutiny Committee. He was also opposition defence spokesman, foreign affairs spokesman, and a member of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. During the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum, he strongly sided with the &quot;No&quot; campaign.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that in the 1997 election he was being offered a peerage, in a similar fashion to fellow Welsh Labour MP Ray Powell, in return for a younger candidate taking his seat, as it is one of Labour&#x27;s safest, an offer which he allegedly rejected.

==Personal life and death==
In 1955, Rogers married Ceridwen James; they had four children and were married until her death in 2022. After retiring from Parliament, he continued to work for the British Geological Survey, the Geological Society, and became Chair of the Earth Science Education Forum. 

His family was incredibly important to him. He died on 28 November 2023, at the age of 91. His successor as MP for Rhondda, Sir Chris Bryant, called him &quot;a magnificent advocate for the people of the Rhondda through some of its darkest times&quot;.

<text>Eileen Gordon (&quot;née&quot; Leatt; born 22 October 1946) is a former Labour Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, who represented Romford from 1997 to 2001.

==Early life and education==
Gordon was born in Islington, the daughter of Charles and Margaret Rose Leatt (née Mallett). She was educated at Harold Hill Grammar School, Shoreditch Comprehensive School, and Westminster College, Oxford (Cert.Ed.).

==Career==
She worked as a teacher for the Mawney School in Romford. At the 1986 local elections, Gordon and her husband Tony were the Labour candidates for Collier Row, centred on the area of that name in Havering (part of the Romford constituency). However, both council seats were held by the Conservative Party.

Gordon was an assistant to the Labour MP for West Ham, Tony Banks, from 1990 to 1997.

She contested the Conservative-held seat of Romford for Labour at the 1992 general election, but was unsuccessful. In 1994, she stood for election to Havering Council again, this time for Gidea Park (named for the area of the same name).

The 1992 general election had been her party&#x27;s fourth loss in a row, but in 1997, as part of the landslide victory spearheaded by party leader Tony Blair, Gordon won Romford, becoming the first Labour elected MP for the seat since 1970. Whilst in Parliament, she was a member of the Broadcasting Select Committee from 1998 to 2001, and the Health Select Committee, from 1999 to 2001.

However, despite Blair winning a second term as Prime Minister at the subsequent 2001 election, Gordon lost her seat to the Conservative candidate Andrew Rosindell. It was one of the few Labour losses at that election, which saw her party retain its large majority from the 1997 election.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Gordon married Tony Gordon; the couple had a son and daughter. Tony was elected to Havering Borough Council in 1990, representing Oldchurch in Romford until 1998. He died in 2005.

<doc id="524139" wikidata="Q514565" url="?curid=524139" title="Bottle Rocket">
<text>Bottle Rocket is a 1996 American crime comedy film directed by Wes Anderson in his feature film directorial debut. The film is written by Anderson and Owen Wilson and is based on Anderson&#x27;s 1992 short film of the same name. &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; is also the acting debut for brothers Owen and Luke Wilson, who co-starred with Robert Musgrave, their older brother Andrew Wilson, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Principal photography took place in various locations throughout Texas.

The film had a limited release in theaters on February 21, 1996. Though not a commercial success, the film received acclaim from critics and launched the film careers of Anderson and the Wilson brothers. Director Martin Scorsese later named &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; one of his top-ten favorite films of the 1990s.

==Plot==
In Arizona, Dignan &quot;rescues&quot; his friend Anthony from a voluntary psychiatric unit, where he has been staying for self-described exhaustion. Dignan has an elaborate escape plan and has developed a 75-year plan that he shows to Anthony. The plan is to pull off several heists, and then meet up with a Mr. Henry, a landscaper and part-time criminal known to Dignan.

As a practice heist, the two friends break into Anthony&#x27;s family&#x27;s house, stealing specific items from a previously-agreed list. Afterward, critiquing the heist, Dignan reveals that he took a pair of earrings not specified on the list. This upsets Anthony, as he had purchased the earrings for his mother as a gift and specifically left them off the list. Anthony visits his little sister at her school and asks her to return the earrings.

Dignan recruits Bob Mapplethorpe as a getaway driver because he is the only person they know with a car. The three of them buy a gun and return to Bob&#x27;s house to plan their next heist, which will be at a local bookstore. The group bickers as Dignan struggles to describe his intricate plan.

The group steals a small sum of money from the bookstore and goes &quot;on the lam&quot;, stopping to stay at a motel. Anthony meets Inez, one of the motel maids, and the two spark a romance despite their language barrier (Inez speaks little English, and Anthony can&#x27;t speak Spanish).

Bob learns that his marijuana crop back home has been discovered by police, and that his older brother has been arrested. He leaves in his car the following day to help his brother, without telling Dignan. Before leaving the motel themselves, Anthony gives Dignan an envelope to give to Inez. Dignan delivers it to her while she is cleaning a room, not knowing that the envelope has most of his and Anthony&#x27;s money inside. Inez does not open the envelope and hugs Dignan to say goodbye.

As Dignan is leaving, Inez asks an English-speaking male friend of hers to chase after him and tell him that she loves Anthony. When he delivers the message he says, &quot;Tell Anthony I love him.&quot; Dignan fails to realize he is speaking for Inez and does not deliver the message.

Dignan discovers a dilapidated but functional Alfa Romeo Spider, and he and Anthony continue with the 75-year plan. The car breaks down eventually and Anthony reveals that the envelope Dignan gave to Inez contained the rest of their cash. They have a confrontation and go their separate ways.

Narrating a letter to his sister, Anthony says he and Bob have settled into a routine back at home that is keeping him busy. Dignan, who has joined Mr. Henry&#x27;s gang, tracks Anthony down and they reconcile. Dignan invites him to a heist with Mr. Henry which he accepts on the condition that Bob is allowed in too.

The trio meet the eccentric Mr. Henry and plan to rob a safe at a cold storage facility. He becomes a role model for them, standing up to Bob&#x27;s abusive brother and tutoring Dignan on success. He invites the trio to a party at his house, and visits the group at the Mapplethorpes&#x27; house, which he compliments. Anthony learns of Inez&#x27;s love for him and contacts her via phone. Her English has improved and they rekindle their relationship.

The group conducts their heist at the cold storage facility with Applejack and Kumar, accomplices from Mr. Henry&#x27;s landscaping company. The plan quickly falls apart with Kumar unable to crack the safe, and Bob accidentally firing his gun, which in turn triggers a cardiac event in Applejack.

As the police arrive, Dignan has locked himself out of the escape van and is arrested and brutalized by police. At the same time as the crew are doing their heist, Mr. Henry loads furniture from Bob&#x27;s into a truck. Later, Anthony and Bob visit Dignan in prison and tell him about Mr. Henry robbing Bob&#x27;s house.

While Bob and Anthony are saying their goodbyes, Dignan begins rattling off an escape plan and tells his friends to get into position for a get-away. After a tense moment, the two realize Dignan is joking. Dignan says to Anthony, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it funny that you used to be in the nuthouse and now I&#x27;m in jail?&quot; as he walks back into the prison.

==Production==
In 1992, Wes Anderson directed a 13-minute short film, titled &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot;. The short was filmed in black and white, and also starred Owen and Luke Wilson and Musgrave. The short had a similar plot to the later feature film. The film was screened at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, where it attracted the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks who agreed to finance a full-length version of the short.

With the exception of its introduction, which was shot at Camarillo State Mental Hospital, the feature-length film was shot in Dallas, Fort Worth, and Hillsboro, Texas. The scenes at Bob Mapplethorpe&#x27;s house were filmed at the John Gillin Residence.

After the film failed to achieve commercial success, Owen Wilson considered joining the Marines. Bill Murray was considered for the role of Abe Henry.

==Reception==

&quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; received generally positive reviews from film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an 86% rating based on 71 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10.

On Metacritic, it has a 66/100 weighted average score based on 24 critics.

Martin Scorsese is a fan of the film, calling it one of his favorite movies of the 1990s. In a 2000 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Scorsese praised Wes Anderson for his ability to &quot;convey the simple joys and interactions between people so well and with such richness&quot;.

==Home media==
In 2008, &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of The Criterion Collection.

<doc id="524143" wikidata="Q4910176" url="?curid=524143" title="Bill Michie">
<text>William Michie (24 November 1935 – 22 September 2017) was a British politician.

When he stood down, he was Labour Member of Parliament for Sheffield Heeley from 1983 to 2001. He was a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of MPs and the Parliamentary Humanist Group. After his death, the BBC described him as &quot;a stalwart of Sheffield politics.&quot;

==Early life==
Michie was born in Sheffield to Arthur Michie, a Turner, and his wife, Violet. He was educated at the city&#x27;s Abbeydale secondary school and Sheffield Polytechnic.

==Career==

Michie worked as a maintenance electrician and laboratory technician until he was made redundant in 1981 and was then unemployed until he entered parliament in 1983. He was &quot;a life-long member&quot; of the AEU. 

He joined the Labour Party in 1965, and in 1970 he was elected to Sheffield City Council. Would serve on the council until 1984 with spells as chairman of its planning (1974-1981) and employment (1981-1983) committees. He was also Labour&#x27;s chief whip and group secretary on the council for nine years. 

From 1974 until 1986, the duration of its existence, he also served on South Yorkshire County Council, chairing its area planning committee from 1974 until 1981.

In her obituary of Michie, Julia Langdon noted that he was &quot;among an energetic group of young Labour activists who emerged in Sheffield in the 1970s&quot; when the area was part of what was labeled “The People&#x27;s Republic of South Yorkshire.” Originally intended as a criticism of the radical politics pursued by Labour in the region, it came to be embraced by Michie and others. Elected the same day as Michie was future Labour cabinet member David Blunkett. Michie himself would personally raise the red flag above Sheffield Town Hall.

Michie was elected to parliament for Sheffield Heeley at the 1983 general election, significantly bettering the result of his Labour predecessor in an election when his party struggled nationally. In 1985 he became vice-chairman of the Yorkshire group of Labour MPs and, in 1987, became treasurer of the Campaign Group. 

According to the obituary of Michie in &quot;The Yorkshire Post,&quot; opponents in the Conservatives called him &quot;Labour&#x27;s most Left-wing politician&quot; during his time as an MP. Fellow Labour MP Richard Caborn, who considered Michie, a &quot;very dear friend,&quot; said he was always associated with the left of the Labour Party and &quot;always on the side of the minorities.&quot;

==Personal life==

Michie was married twice. His first marriage, which produced two sons, ended in divorce in 1982. He married his second wife, Judith, in 1987, and the marriage lasted until she died in 2016. He was a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday.

<text>Wesley Wales Anderson (born May 1, 1969) is an American filmmaker. His films are known for themes of grief, loss of innocence, and dysfunctional families. Due to his films&#x27; eccentricity, distinctive visual and narrative styles, and frequent use of ensemble casts, critics have cited Anderson as an auteur. Three of his films appeared in BBC Culture&#x27;s 2016 poll of the greatest films since 2000.

Anderson gained acclaim for his early films &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996) and &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998). He often collaborated with brothers Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson during that time and founded his production company American Empirical Pictures. He received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001). His next films included &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007), and his first stop-motion film, &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009), for which he received a Best Animated Feature nomination, and then &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; (2012), earning his second Best Original Screenplay nomination.

For his film &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), he received his first Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Picture, and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay. Later works include his second stop-motion film, &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot; (2018), earning him the Silver Bear for Best Director and another Best Animated Feature nomination, followed by &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021) and &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023). Anderson won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; (2023).

== Early life and education ==
Wesley Wales Anderson was born on May 1, 1969, in Houston, Texas, to Ann Anderson (née Burroughs), a realtor and archaeologist, and Melver Leonard Anderson, who worked in advertising and public relations. He is the second of three boys; his parents divorced when he was eight. His older brother, Mel, is a physician, and his younger brother, Eric Chase Anderson, is a writer and artist whose paintings and designs have appeared in several of Anderson&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;. Anderson is of English, Swedish, and Norwegian ancestry.

He graduated from St. John&#x27;s School in Houston in 1987, which he later used as a prominent location in &quot;Rushmore&quot;. As a child, Anderson made silent films on his father&#x27;s Super 8 camera, which starred his brothers and friends, although his first ambition was to be a writer. Anderson worked part-time as a cinema projectionist at Hogg Memorial Auditorium while attending the University of Texas at Austin, where he met his roommate and future collaborator Owen Wilson in 1989. In 1991, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with a major in philosophy. He describes being intrigued by &quot;The&quot; &quot;Meaning of Meaning&quot; by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards.

== Film career ==
=== 1990s ===
Anderson&#x27;s first film was &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996), based on a short film of the same name that he made with Luke and Owen Wilson. It is a crime caper about a group of young Texans aspiring to achieve major heists. It was well reviewed but performed poorly at the box office.

His next film was &quot;Rushmore&quot; (1998), a quirky comedy about a high school student&#x27;s crush on an elementary school teacher starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, and Olivia Williams. It was a critical and financial success. The film launched Murray&#x27;s second act as a respected actor in independent cinema. Murray appeared in many of Anderson&#x27;s subsequent films. At the 1999 Independent Spirit Awards, Anderson won the Best Director award and Murray won Best Supporting Male. Murray also earned a nomination for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. In 2000, filmmaker Martin Scorsese praised &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; and &quot;Rushmore&quot;. Since its release, &quot;Rushmore&quot; has gained cult status, and in 2016, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

=== 2000s ===
Anderson&#x27;s next comedy-drama, &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, was released in 2001. The film focuses on a successful, artistic New York City family and its ostracized patriarch, played by Gene Hackman. It also stars Anjelica Huston as the ex-wife and Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Gwyneth Paltrow as the children. The film was a box-office and critical success. It was Anderson&#x27;s greatest financial success until &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot;, earning more than $50 million in domestic box-office receipts. &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award and ranked by an &quot;Empire&quot; poll as the 159th greatest film ever made.

Anderson&#x27;s next feature was &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; (2004), about a Jacques Cousteau-esque documentary filmmaker played by Bill Murray. The film also stars Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Anjelica Huston, and Michael Gambon. It is a classic example of Anderson&#x27;s style, but its critical reception was less favorable than his previous films&#x27;, and its box office did not match the heights of &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.
&quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007) was about three emotionally distant brothers traveling together on a train in India. It reflects the more dramatic tone of &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; but faced criticism similar to those of &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;. Anderson has acknowledged that he went to India to film the movie partly as a tribute to Indian filmmaker Satyajit Ray, whose &quot;films have also inspired all my other movies in different ways&quot; (the film is dedicated to him). The film stars Anderson staples Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson in addition to Adrien Brody, and the script is by Anderson, Schwartzman, and Roman Coppola.

Anderson has also made several notable short films. In addition to the original &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; short, he made &quot;Hotel Chevalier&quot; (2007), which is set in Paris. It is a prologue to &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;, and stars Schwartzman alongside Natalie Portman. He wrote a script for Brian Grazer for an English-language remake of Patrice Leconte&#x27;s &quot;My Best Friend&quot;. In 2010 he said that he did not plan to direct the film, tentatively called &quot;The Rosenthaler Suite&quot;. In 2009, Anderson&#x27;s stop-motion-animated film adaptation based on the Roald Dahl book &quot;Fantastic Mr Fox&quot; was released. Its voice actors include Murray, Dafoe, Schwartzman, Brody, Gambon, Owen Wilson, George Clooney, and Meryl Streep. Critics praised it highly and it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, although it barely made back its production budget.

=== 2010s ===

In 2012, Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; was released, debuting at the Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the . The film is a coming-of-age comedy set in a fictional New England town. It includes ensemble performances by Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and Tilda Swinton. The film is emblematic of Anderson&#x27;s style and earned him another Academy Award nomination for his screenplay. The film was also a financial success, earning $68.3 million at the box office against a budget of only $16 million.

In 2014, Anderson&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, was released. It stars Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Saoirse Ronan, Jeff Goldblum, Willem Dafoe, F. Murray Abraham, and several of Anderson&#x27;s regular collaborators, including Murray, Owen Wilson, Swinton and Schwartzman. It is mostly set in the 1930s and follows the adventures of M. Gustave, the hotel&#x27;s concierge, making &quot;a marvelous mockery of history, turning its horrors into a series of graceful jokes and mischievous gestures&quot;, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The film is one of Anderson&#x27;s greatest critical and commercial successes, grossing nearly $175 million worldwide and earning dozens of award nominations, including nine Oscar nominations with four wins for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score. These nominations also included his first for Best Director.

Anderson returned to stop-motion animation with &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;. Production on the film started in the United Kingdom in October 2016, and it was released in March–April 2018. The film received Academy Award nominations for Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score.

===2020s===
Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; is set in post-war France and stars Benicio Del Toro, Jeffrey Wright, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton and Timothée Chalamet. Its release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, finally premiering at the Cannes Film Festival on July 12, 2021, with a general release in the United States on October 22, 2021. In the meantime, Searchlight Pictures released in September 2021 an animated music video of Christophe&#x27;s &quot;Aline&quot; covered by Jarvis Cocker, directed by Anderson with animations by Javi Aznarez.

In November 2021, Anderson finished filming &quot;Asteroid City&quot;, but few details were revealed to the press. Much of the film was shot in the Spanish city of Chinchón, where a huge diorama set reproducing Monument Valley was constructed. The film stars Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Bryan Cranston, Jeff Goldblum, Hope Davis, and Jeffrey Wright, among others. It premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. It had its United States theatrical release on June 16, 2023. The film received generally positive reviews.

Anderson then directed an adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s short story collection &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More&quot; for Netflix. The 41-minute short film titled &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; premiered at the 2023 Venice Film Festival. It received critical acclaim. It was followed by a limited U.S. theatrical release on September 20, and a Netflix premiere on September 27, 2023. It stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Dev Patel, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley. Anderson had three other short films based on Roald Dahl&#x27;s work also premiere on Netflix in September 2023. The other shorts, all of which are 16 minutes long, were &quot;The Swan&quot;, &quot;The Rat Catcher&quot;, and &quot;Poison&quot;. They were released on September 28, September 29 and September 30, respectively. At the 96th Academy Awards, &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot; was nominated for Best Live Action Short Film and won, earning Wes Anderson&#x27;s first Oscar win; however, he did not appear in-person to accept the Oscar due to his filming schedule. The same month the four short films were combined into one anthology film titled &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Three More&quot; which released March 15, 2024 on Netflix.

In March 2024, Anderson began production in Germany for a new film called &quot;The Phoenician Scheme&quot;, with Benicio del Toro, Michael Cera, and Bill Murray confirmed to star, with some of Anderson&#x27;s other regular stars expected to appear.

== Style and directing techniques ==
=== Cinematic influences ===
Anderson&#x27;s cinematic influences include Woody Allen, Pedro Almodóvar, Satyajit Ray, Hal Ashby, and Roman Polanski. In an interview with Hoda Kotb on &quot;Today&quot;, Bryan Cranston gave insight into Anderson&#x27;s process (on the same day as one of his &quot;Asteroid City&quot; co-stars, Jason Schwartzman, who built a darkroom in his house because he thought Anderson would approve of his character development). Schwartzman was on Today 3rd Hour. Cranston said:&quot;But it&#x27;s also what surrounds it, where all the actors stay in the same hotel. We have dinner at one table every single night with Wes and all guests; it&#x27;s like actor camp... On a Wes Anderson film there are no trailers, no dressing rooms... there&#x27;s no hierarchy, no call sheet—you are just ready to go at about 9:30, 10:00 in the morning in your wardrobe. You hop in his golf cart with him or a van and you go to the set... you hang out with everyone so you never know if you are going to be called into a scene. He&#x27;s such a kind and generous spirit... also in his personal life. Everyone makes the same amount of money. You just show up and off you go. Sometimes you might [be] just a small supporting role in a scene and then [in] others you&#x27;ll be the lead in a movie.Anderson has a unique directorial style that has led several critics to consider him an auteur. He is considered a central figure in American eccentric cinema.
Some have noted many similarities between much of Anderson&#x27;s work and the 1984 film &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot;, a quirky and eccentric comedy-drama written and directed by Tony Richardson which featured an ensemble cast including Jodie Foster, Beau Bridges, Rob Lowe, Nastassja Kinski, Amanda Plummer, Matthew Modine, and Seth Green in his film debut.

The Soviet comedy movie &quot;Welcome, or No Trespassing&quot; by Elem Klimov (1964) has been pointed out as one major source of inspiration for Wes Anderson, specifically its “camera work, storytelling devices, and charming whimsy&quot;.

=== Favorite films ===
In 2010, Wes Anderson selected twelve of his favorite films from the Criterion closet. Titles three through five were a boxset. They were:

#&quot;The Earrings of Madame de...&quot; (1953)
#&quot;Au hasard Balthazar&quot; (1966)
#&quot;Pigs and Battleships&quot; (1961)
#&quot;The Insect Woman&quot; (1963)
#&quot;Unholy Desire&quot; (1964)
#&quot;The Taking of Power by Louis XIV&quot; (1966)
#&quot;The Spy Who Came in from the Cold&quot; (1965)
#&quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot; (1973)
#&quot;Classe tous risques&quot; (1960)
#&quot;Naked Childhood&quot; (1968)
#&quot;&quot; (1985)
#&quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962)

In 2022, Wes Anderson participated in the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; polls. Held every ten years to select the greatest films of all time, contemporary directors were asked to select ten films of their choice. Anderson&#x27;s choices, all French, in chronological order, were:

* &quot;La Grande Illusion&quot; (1937)
* &quot;Quai des Orfèvres&quot; (1947)
* &quot;The Earrings of Madame de...&quot; (1953)
* &quot;Vivre sa vie&quot; (1962)
* &quot;The Man Who Loved Women&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Loulou&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Vagabond&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Olivier, Olivier&quot; (1993)
* &quot;It All Starts Today&quot; (1999)
* &quot;Rois et reine&quot; (2004)

Anderson has named &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; as his favorite horror film. His three favorite musicals are &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, and &quot;Sadie McKee&quot;.

=== Themes and stories ===
Anderson&#x27;s work has been classified as postmodern, on account of his nostalgic attention to detail, his subversion of mainstream conventions of narrative, his references to different genres in the same film, and his love for eccentric characters with complex sexual identities.

Anderson has mostly directed fast-paced comedies marked by more serious or melancholic elements, with themes often centered on grief, loss of innocence, dysfunctional families, parental abandonment, adultery, sibling rivalry and unlikely friendships. His movies have been noted as unusually character-driven and, by turns, both derided and praised with terms like &quot;literary geek chic&quot;. Their plots often feature thefts and unexpected disappearances, with a tendency to borrow liberally from the caper genre.

=== Visual style ===
According to Alex Buono, Anderson has been noted for extensive use of flat space camera moves (pans, tilts, and zooms within scenes that look two-dimensional), symmetrical compositions, snap-zooms (rapid, shakey zooms onto subjects), slow-motion walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and handmade art direction often using miniatures. These stylistic choices give his movies a distinctive quality that has provoked much discussion, critical study, supercuts, mash-ups, and parody. Many writers, critics, and Anderson himself have commented that this gives his movies the feel of being &quot;self-contained worlds&quot; or a &quot;scale-model household&quot;. According to Jesse Fox Mayshark, his films have &quot;a baroque pop bent that is not realist, surrealist or magic realist&quot;, but rather might be described as &quot;fabul[ist]&quot;. In 2019, the company Murals Wallpaper launched a line of wallpapers inspired by the visual design of Anderson&#x27;s films.

Since &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, Anderson has relied more heavily on stop motion animation and miniatures, even making entire features with stop motion animation with &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; and &quot;Isle of Dogs&quot;.

=== Soundtracks ===
Anderson frequently uses pop music from the 1960s and &#x27;70s on the soundtracks of his films, and one band or musician tends to dominate each soundtrack. &quot;Rushmore&quot; prominently featured Cat Stevens and British Invasion groups; &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; featured Nico; &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,&quot; David Bowie, including both originals and covers performed by Seu Jorge; &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; and &quot;Rushmore,&quot; the Kinks&quot;;&quot; &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;, the Beach Boys; and &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot;, Hank Williams. &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; is also filled with the music of Benjamin Britten, which is tied to a number of major plot points. &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; also borrowed music styles from Satyajit Ray&#x27;s films.

&quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, which is mostly set in the 1930s, eschews pop music, instead using music by Alexandre Desplat. Its soundtrack won Desplat the Academy Award for Best Original Score, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music, and World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Score of the Year.

The soundtracks for his films have often brought renewed attention to the artists featured, most prominently in the case of &quot;These Days&quot;, which was used in &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.

=== Recurring collaborators ===
Anderson&#x27;s films feature many recurring actors, including the Wilson brothers (Owen, Luke, and Andrew), Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Bob Balaban, Tony Revolori, and Tilda Swinton. Robert Yeoman has served as director of photography for all of Anderson&#x27;s live-action films, while Mark Mothersbaugh composed Anderson&#x27;s first four films, and Alexandre Desplat the next six, taking over with &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;. Randall Poster has served as music supervisor for all of Anderson&#x27;s films since &quot;Rushmore&quot;. Anderson has co-written films with Noah Baumbach, Roman Coppola, and Hugo Guinness. His films have often been financed by Steven Rales through his production company Indian Paintbrush.

== Personal life ==
Anderson is in a romantic relationship with Lebanese writer, costume designer, and voice actress Juman Malouf, the daughter of novelist Hanan al-Shaykh. Malouf gave birth to the couple&#x27;s daughter, Freya in 2016. Bill Murray is the godfather.

Anderson has maintained an apartment in Paris since 2005, after spending most of his adult life in New York City. He is the brother of author, illustrator and actor Eric Chase Anderson.

== Filmography ==

== Awards and nominations ==

== In popular culture ==
Anderson&#x27;s distinctive filmmaking style has led to numerous homages and parodies. Notable examples include:
*In October 2013, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in an episode hosted by Edward Norton, presented a parody trailer for a fictional Wes Anderson horror movie titled &quot;The Midnight Coterie of Sinister Intruders&quot;.
*In November 2017, &quot;Family Guy&quot; aired its sixteenth season episode titled &quot;Three Directors&quot;, about Peter Griffin&#x27;s firing from his job at the brewery, as told in the idiosyncratic styles of directors Quentin Tarantino, Anderson and Michael Bay.
*In January 2021, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; aired its thirty-second season episode titled &quot;The Dad-Feelings Limited&quot;, a reference to Anderson&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;. The episode itself tells the origin story of Comic Book Guy and refers to several Anderson styles and tropes, including a &quot;Royal Tenenbaums&quot;-esque chronicling of the character&#x27;s elaborate family tree.
*In October 2021, Anderson redesigned the interior of the Pullman carriage &quot;Cygnus&quot;, which had its first run with the new design on October 13, 2021.
*In July 26, 2023, The Fourth episode of Season 2 of &quot;The_Afterparty_(TV_series)&quot; the portion of the episode shown as a flashback is a clear homage to Anderson style of film making.

<text>Samuel Laird Galbraith (18 October 1945 – 18 August 2014) was a Scottish politician and neurosurgeon who served as Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture from 2000 to 2001 and Minister for Children and Education from 1999 to 2000. Galbraith was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Strathkelvin and Bearsden from 1999 to 2001, and a Member of Parliament (MP) in the British House of Commons for the equivalent seat from 1987 to 2001. 

The Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition faced demands from Scottish National Party (SNP) politicians, including future First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, for Galbraith to resign after the SQA examinations controversy in 2000.

==Early life==
Galbraith was born in Clitheroe, Lancashire, to Samuel Galbraith and Catherine Navin. He was educated at Greenock High School. He studied at Glasgow University, where he received honours in medicine. Galbraith was a respected neurosurgeon, who worked at Glasgow&#x27;s Southern General Hospital.

==Political career==
At the 1987 general election, he was returned as Member of Parliament for the Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency, and held the seat until standing down at the 2001 general election. He was a Scottish Office Minister between 1997 and 1999.

Galbraith served as Minister for Children and Education in the Scottish Executive under Donald Dewar from 1999 to 2000 and then as Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture. On 20 March 2001 he announced his resignation from ministerial office and his parliamentary seats for health reasons.

==Personal life==
He was married in 1987 to Nicola Tennant, and they had three daughters, Mhairi, Heather and Fiona. In prior years he was an avid mountaineer who had climbed all the Munros and also climbed in the Alps and Himalayas.

Galbraith received a lung transplant in 1990, at Freeman&#x27;s Hospital Newcastle (where he continued to receive treatment), due to fibrosing alveolitis, a condition that his elder sister died from.

From 2006 he was chairman of the Scottish Maritime Museum with facilities at Irvine, North Ayrshire and Dumbarton.

He died on 18 August 2014.

<text>David Anthony Lock KC (born 2 May 1960) is a barrister and former Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. He was educated at Esher Grammar School, Woking Sixth Form College, Jesus College, Cambridge (MA theology 1982) and Polytechnic of Central London (Diploma in law 1984), and went on to Gray&#x27;s Inn as a Wilson Scholar in 1985.

He was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wyre Forest in the 1997 general election, but lost his seat in the 2001 election to Richard Taylor, the Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern candidate. He served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department from July 1999 to June 2001.

He became the first Labour MP in the Wyre Forest for many years but lost his seat when he supported changes to the accident and emergency services at Kidderminster General Hospital in the face of public opposition. The downgrading of emergency services at Kidderminster were the first of many such changes across the country, many of which attracted trenchant local opposition.

Following his election defeat he became a director of Searchflow Limited and founded a litigation funding company, IML Limited. In January 2002 he became Chair of the Service Authorities to the National Crime Squad and National Criminal Intelligence Service and was concerned with the merger of those bodies to become the Serious Organised Crime Agency. In late 2003 he returned to legal practice, heading up healthcare law at the law firm Mills &amp; Reeve. He was then involved in a series of high-profile legal cases concerning healthcare and in 2008 returned to practice at the Bar. He is a member of Landmark Chambers, 180 Fleet Street, London. He was a member of the Department of Health Organ Donation Taskforce in 2008/09.

He is Chair of the West Midlands Labour Finance and Industry Group and is a qualified paraglider pilot. He was made a KC in 2011 and was the Birmingham Law Society&#x27;s choice of &quot;Barrister of the Year&quot; in April 2011.

David Lock KC is a non-executive board director of Innovation Birmingham and also a non-executive director at Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. He is also a Trustee of Brook, the sexual health advice charity for young people and a member of the British Medical Association Medical Ethics Committee.

<text>Sir Raymond William Whitney (28 November 1930 – 15 August 2012) was a British Conservative politician and diplomat. He served as the Member of Parliament for Wycombe from 1978 to 2001.

== Early life and education ==
Whitney was born in Northampton on 28 November 1930. He was educated at Wellingborough School and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Northamptonshire Regiment. 

== Diplomatic career ==
He resigned in 1964 in order to join the Diplomatic Service and served from 1966 to 1968 as first secretary at the Office of British Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in Peking during the Cultural Revolution. He also served as deputy High Commissioner to Bangladesh between 1973 and 1976, and, in his final appointment, was head of the Information Research Department, the Foreign Office&#x27;s counter-propaganda department.

== Political career ==
Whitney was elected as (MP) for Wycombe at a by-election in 1978 caused by the death of Sir John Hall. He served as parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to Nigel Lawson and Peter Rees at the Treasury. 

Following the 1983 general election he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office, moving to occupy the same position at the Department of Health and Social Security from October 1984 to September 1986. &quot;The Independent&quot; characterized Whitney as someone who &quot;combined strongly right-wing views with staunch support of British membership of the European Community.&quot;

Whitney stepped down at the 2001 general election, and was succeeded by Paul Goodman.

<text>A suicide note or death note is a message written by a person who intends to die by suicide.

A study examining Japanese suicide notes estimated that 25–30% of suicides are accompanied by a note. However, incidence rates may depend on ethnicity and cultural differences, and may reach rates as high as 50% in certain demographics. A suicide message can be in any form or medium, but the most common methods are by a written note, an audio message, or a video.

==Reasons==
Some fields of study, such as sociology, psychiatry and graphology, have investigated the reasons why people who complete or attempt suicide leave a note.

The most common reasons that people contemplating suicide choose to write a suicide note include one or more of the following:
*To ease the pain of those known to the victim by attempting to dissipate guilt.
*To increase the pain of survivors by attempting to create guilt.
*To set out the reason(s) for suicide.
*To send a message to the world.
*To express thoughts and feelings that the person felt unable to express in life.
*To give instructions for disposal of the remains.
*Occasionally, to confess acts of murder or some other offence.

Sometimes there is also a message in the case of murder-suicide, explaining the reason(s) for the murder(s), see for example, Marc Lépine&#x27;s suicide statement and videotaped statements of the 7 July 2005 London bombers.

<text>Tómas Guðmundsson (6 January 1901 – 14 November 1983) was an Icelandic writer. He was known as Reykjavík&#x27;s poet &quot;(Reykjavíkurskáldið, skáld Reykjavíkur)&quot;.

Tómas&#x27;s parents were Steinunn Þorsteinsdóttir and Guðmundur Ögmundsson, living at Efri-Brú in Grímsnes. He soon got in touch with literature and poetry. He read Icelandic sagas, Jónas Hallgrímsson&#x27;s poems and more. He also started to write his own poetry at a young age.

==Career==
He moved to Reykjavík and studied at Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík, there he got in touch with many authors, including Halldór Laxness (they formed a close friendship during the M.R. years), Guðmundur G. Hagalín and Davíð Stefánsson. Tómas graduated from M.R. in 1921.

He then studied law at Háskóli Íslands and graduated in 1926. During that time he got in touch with even more authors, including Jón Thoroddsen junior.

After his graduation he opened an office to practise law and in 1928 he started working at Hagstofa Íslands. He closed his office in 1929 and quit the bureau in 1943.

From 1943 he mostly worked at poetry and authorship. He was one of the editors of the literary magazines &quot;Helgafell&quot; and &quot;Nýja Helgafell&quot;, and also translated stories, plays and poems.

==Death==
Tómas died 1983 in Reykjavík, aged 82.

==Legacy==
Since 1994, the city of Reykjavík has made an award in memory of Tómas called the Bókmenntaverðlaun Tómasar Guðmundssonar (the Tómas Guðmundsson literature award).

A statue of Tómas by the sculptor Halla Gunnarsdóttir was unveiled in 2010 at the southern end of the Tjörnin, a lake in Reykjavík centrum.

==Works==
Tómas&#x27;s poems were mostly traditional and his style did not change much during his career. The poems are mostly about Reykjavík and his place of youth.

The first three books he published, &quot;Við sundin blá&quot;, &quot;Fagra veröld&quot; and &quot;Stjörnur vorsins&quot; belong to neoromanticism and so do his last two books, &quot;Fljótið helga&quot; and &quot;Heim til þín, Ísland&quot;, but its signs are not as strong.

==Publications==
*1925: Við sundin blá, poems
*1933: Fagra veröld, poems
*1940: Stjörnur vorsins, poems
*1950: Fljótið helga, poems
*1953: Ljóðasafn, poems

<doc id="524169" wikidata="Q5754496" url="?curid=524169" title="High concept">
<text>High concept is a type of artistic work that can be easily pitched with a succinctly stated premise. It can be contrasted with &quot;low concept&quot;, which is more concerned with character development and other subtleties that are not as easily summarized. The origin of the term is disputed.

==Terminology==
High-concept narratives are typically characterized by an overarching &quot;?&quot; scenario that catalyzes the following events. Many summer blockbuster movies are built on a high-concept idea, such as &quot;what if we could clone dinosaurs?&quot; as in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

High-concept narratives differ from analogous narratives. In the case of the latter, a high-concept story may be employed to allow commentary on an implicit subtext. A prime example of this might be George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, which asks, &quot;What if we lived in a future of totalitarian government?&quot; while simultaneously generating social comment and critique aimed at Orwell&#x27;s own (real-world) contemporary society. Similarly, the Gene Roddenberry&#x27;s sci-fi series &quot;Star Trek&quot; went beyond the high-concept storytelling of a futurist starship crew, by addressing 20th century social issues in a hypothetical and defamiliarizing context. &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968) likewise engages in social commentary regarding race relations and other topics from modern human society via the lens of the ape civilization, in part as a response by screenplay co-writer Rod Serling to his experiences of anti-Semitism.

==Characteristics==
The term is often applied to films that are pitched and developed almost entirely upon an engaging premise with broad appeal, rather than standing upon complex character study, cinematography, or other strengths that relate more to the artistic execution of a production. Extreme examples of high-concept films are &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot; and &quot;Sharknado&quot;, which describe their entire premises in their titles.

A movie described as being &quot;high-concept&quot; is considered easy to sell to a wide audience because it delivers upon an easy-to-grasp idea. This simple narrative can often be summed up with a single iconic image, such as the theme park logo from &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; Along with having well-defined genre and aesthetics, high-concept films have marketing guidelines known as &quot;the look, the hook and the book&quot;.
* The look of the film is simply how visually appealing it is to the public, usually before its release. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; would show the world dinosaurs as they had never been seen before.
* The hook is the story the film is trying to sell to its audience. Everyone wanted to know how dinosaurs could walk the Earth again after being extinct for 65 million years and how they would coexist with people.
* The book can be labeled as all the merchandise made to help promote the film. The merchandise in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was destined to sell well, with people wanting the T-shirts and lunch boxes that were shown for sale within the movie itself, with similar merchandise later to be sold at Universal Studios in the gift shop connected to the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; ride.

==Commercial benefits==
High-concept television series and movies often rely on pre-sold properties such as movie stars to build audience anticipation, and they might use cross-promotional advertising campaigns with links to a soundtrack, music videos, and licensed merchandise such as DVD box sets. They commonly apply market and test screening feedback to alter the narrative (or even, as in the case of &quot;Snakes on a Plane&quot;, the dialogue) to ensure maximum popularity. Some commercial blockbuster movies are built as star vehicles for successful music and sports personalities to enter the movie business. In such commercial vehicles, where the onscreen activity is less important than the marketability of the product brand, a high-concept narrative is often used as a &quot;safe&quot; option to avoid the risk of alienating audiences with convoluted or overly taxing plot exposition.

<doc id="524170" wikidata="Q638407" url="?curid=524170" title="St. Lawrence Island">
<text>St. Lawrence Island (, ) is located west of mainland Alaska in the Bering Sea, just south of the Bering Strait. The village of Gambell, located on the northwest cape of the island, is from the Chukchi Peninsula in the Russian Far East. The island is part of Alaska, but closer to Russia and Asia than to the Alaskan and North American mainland. St. Lawrence Island is thought to be one of the last exposed portions of the land bridge that once joined Asia with North America during the Pleistocene period. It is the sixth largest island in the United States and the 113th largest island in the world. It is considered part of the Bering Sea Volcanic Province. The Saint Lawrence Island shrew (&quot;Sorex jacksoni&quot;) is a species of shrew endemic to St. Lawrence Island. The island is jointly owned by the predominantly Siberian Yupik villages of Gambell and Savoonga, the two main settlements on the island.

==Geography==

The United States Census Bureau defines St. Lawrence Island as Block Group 6, Census Tract 1 of Nome Census Area, Alaska. As of the 2000 census there were 1,292 people living on a land area of . The island is about long and wide. The island has no trees, and the only woody plants are Arctic willow, standing no more than a foot (30 cm) high.

The island&#x27;s abundance of seabirds and marine mammals is due largely to the influence of the Anadyr Current, an ocean current which brings cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep waters of the Bering Sea shelf edge.

To the south of the island there was a persistent polynya in 1999, formed when the prevailing winds from the north and east blow the migrating ice away from the coast.

The climate of Gambell is:
==Villages==
The island contains and is jointly owned by two villages: Savoonga and Gambell. The island is now inhabited mostly by Siberian Yupik engaged in hunting, fishing, and reindeer herding. As a result of having title to the land, the Yupik are legally able to sell the fossilized ivory and other artifacts found on St. Lawrence Island.

The St. Lawrence Island Yupik people are also known for their skill in carving, mostly with materials from marine mammals (walrus ivory and whale bone). The Arctic yo-yo may have evolved on the island. Anthropologist Lars Krutak has examined the tattoo traditions of the St. Lawrence Yupik.

In St. Lawrence Island, earliest evidence of habitation dates from 2,000 to 2,500 years ago. Artifacts resemble the Okvik (oogfik) style. Archaeological sites on the Punuk Islands, off the eastern end of St. Lawrence Island, at Kukulik, near Savoonga and on hill slopes above Gambell, all indicate evidence of Okvik habitation. Okvik decorative style is zoomorphic and elaborate. Sometimes crude engraving, with greater variation than the Old Bering Sea and Punuk styles.

Okvik habitation, influenced by Old Bering Sea habitation of 2000 to 700 years ago, is characterized by the simpler and more homogeneous Punuk style. Stone artifacts changed from chipped stone to ground slate; carved ivory harpoon heads are smaller and simpler in design.

Prehistoric and early historic settlements of St. Lawrence Island were temporary. Periods of abandonment and reoccupation depended on resources along with favorable climate. Famine occurred, shown by Harris lines and enamel hypoplasia in human skeletons. With travel to and from the mainland during calm weather, the island was used as a hunting base. Sites were re-used occasionally rather than permanently.

Major archaeology sites at Gambell and Savoonga (Kukulik) were excavated by Otto Geist and Ivar Skarland of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Collections from these excavations are curated at the University of Alaska Museum on the UAF campus.

===Arrival of Europeans===
The island is called &quot;Sivuqaq&quot; by the Yupik who live there. It was visited by Russian/Danish explorer Vitus Bering on St. Lawrence&#x27;s Day, August 10, 1728, and named after the day of his visit. The island was the first place in Alaska known to have been visited by European explorers.

There were about 4,000 Central Alaskan Yupik and Siberian Yupik living in several villages on the island in the mid-19th century. They subsisted by hunting walrus and whale and by fishing. The famine in 1878–1880 caused many to starve and many others to leave, decimating the island&#x27;s population. A revenue cutter visited the island in 1880 and estimated that out of 700 inhabitants, 500 were found dead of starvation. Reports of the day put the blame on traders&#x27; supplying the people with liquor causing the people to ″neglect laying up their usual supply of provisions″. Nearly all the residents remaining were Siberian Yupik.

Reindeer were introduced on the island in 1900 in an attempt to bolster the economy. The reindeer herd grew to about 10,000 animals by 1917, but has since declined. Reindeer are herded as a source of subsistence meat to this day. In 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt established a reindeer reservation on the island. This caused legal issues in the indigenous land claim process to acquire surface and subsurface rights to their land, under the section 19 of Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) as they had to prove that the reindeer reserve was set up to support the indigenous people rather than to protect the reindeer themselves.

===World War II===
During World War II, islanders served in the Alaska Territorial Guard (ATG). Following disbandment of the ATG in 1947, and with the construction of Northeast Cape Air Force Station in 1952, many islanders joined the Alaska National Guard to provide for the defense of the island and station.

===Cold War to Present===
 On June 22, 1955, during the Cold War, a US Navy P2V Neptune with a crew of 11 was attacked by two Soviet Air Forces fighter aircraft along the International Date Line in international waters over the Bering Straits, between Siberia&#x27;s Kamchatka Peninsula and Alaska. The P2V crashed on the island&#x27;s northwest cape, near the village of Gambell. Villagers rescued the crew, 3 of whom were wounded by Soviet fire and 4 of whom were injured in the crash. The Soviet government, in response to a US diplomatic protest, was unusually conciliatory, stating that:
The Soviet military was under strict orders to &quot;avoid any action beyond the limits of the Soviet state frontiers.&quot;

The Soviet government &quot;expressed regret in regard to the incident,&quot; and, &quot;taking into account... conditions which do not exclude the possibility of a mistake from one side or the other,&quot; was willing to compensate the US for 50% of damages sustained—the first such offer ever made by the Soviets for any Cold War shoot-down incident.

The US government stated that it was satisfied with the Soviet expression of regret and the offer of partial compensation, although it said that the Soviet statement also fell short of what the available information indicated.

Northeast Cape Air Force Station, at the island&#x27;s other end, was a United States Air Force facility consisting of an Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&amp;W) radar site, a United States Air Force Security Service listening post; and a White Alice Communications System (WACS) site that operated from about 1952 to about 1972. The area surrounding the Northeast Cape base site had been a traditional camp site for several Yupik families for centuries. After the base closed down in the 1970s, many of these people started to experience health problems. Even today, people who grew up at Northeast Cape have high rates of cancer and other diseases, possibly due to PCB exposure around the site. According to the State of Alaska, those elevated cancer rates have been shown to be comparable to the rates of other Alaskan and non-Alaskan arctic natives who were not exposed to a similar Air Force facility. The majority of the facility was removed in a $10.5 million cleanup program in 2003. Monitoring of the site will continue into the future.

After the passage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, the villages of Savoonga and Gambell opted out of selling their land to the federal government and joining a larger regional Native corporation. In return, they were promised full ownership of St Lawrence Island. In 2016, after completing a decades-long land survey, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management transferred permanent private ownership of the island to the two corporations representing Savoonga and Gambell. 

St. Lawrence Island made national news in April 2023 when Nanuq, an Australian Shepherd dog from Gambell, Alaska, was rescued and returned. The one-year-old dog belonged to a young Yupik named Mandy Iworrigan, who took the dog to Savoonga, where it disappeared. It was found weeks later in Wales on the Alaskan mainland. Large areas of the surrounding sea were covered by ice at the time. The dog is believed to have survived the 150-mile crossing by catching wild game. After posts about a lost dog in Wales were posted on social media, Nanuq was recognized and returned to its owner.

<doc id="524189" wikidata="Q258066" url="?curid=524189" title="Culture of East Germany">
<text>The culture of East Germany varied throughout the years due to the political and historical events that took place in the 20th century, especially as a result of Nazism and Communism. A reflection on the history of arts and culture in East Germany reveals complex relationships between artists and the state, between oppositional and conformist art. In four decades, East Germany developed a distinct culture and produced works of literature, film, visual arts, music, and theatre of international acclaim. Popular culture specialities included among others a high popularity of nudism in Eastern Germany.

Censorship in East Germany controlled any aspect of culture.

==Socialist Realism==
In the 1950s the officially encouraged form of art was known as &#x27;Socialist Realism&#x27;. This was intended to depict everyday life under Socialism in a way that showed the benefits of living and working in East Germany.

==Literature==

Any text published in the GDR was governmentally controlled.

Erich Honecker coined the term &quot;Leseland DDR&quot; (Reading Nation GDR) in 1981. 

==Press==
The main newspaper was &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, the official newspaper of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The official newspaper of the Free German Youth was Junge Welt.

&quot;Das Magazin&quot; survived the unification of Germany.

The Soviet magazine &quot;Sputnik&quot; in German was considered too liberal for GDR in 1988.

==Music==

===Pop and rock===
Influences from the West were heard everywhere, because TV and radio that came from the &quot;Klassenfeind&quot; (enemy of the working class) could be received in many parts of the east, too (an exception being the area around Dresden, with its geographically disadvantageous position in the Elbe valley, giving it the nickname of &quot;Valley of the Clueless&quot; despite some Western radio being available). 
As rock music became increasingly popular around the world following the meteoric rise of bands like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and others, new bands began forming throughout East Germany. However, fearful of &quot;degenerate Western values [corrupting] the young people who listen to [rock]&quot; as well as rock music&#x27;s tendency to criticize establishments and governments, GDR officials set out to regulate much of the new music. The steps taken to control music included requiring rock bands to sing entirely in German and produce songs of educational value that promoted socialist ideas. Another problem for the authorities was having to check song texts very carefully for anti-state tendencies. The band Renft, for example, fell foul of the authorities, which eventually led to its being banned and disbanded.

State-sanctioned bands such as Puhdys were given an &quot;Auftrittserlaubnis&quot; (Performance permission) that allowed them to play in East German (and occasionally even West German) clubs, festivals, etc. Failure to obtain this card before a performance could result in the forced separation of a band or even imprisonment. The Puhdys, Stern-Combo Meißen and Karat were popular mainstream bands, managing to hint at critical thoughts in their lyrics without being explicit. Like other mainstream acts, they appeared in youth magazines such as &quot;Neues Leben&quot; and &quot;Das Magazin&quot;. State-sanctioned recorded rock and other popular music was produced and distributed by the state enterprise Amiga Records.

Despite the heavy censorship, regulation, and repression imposed by the GDR leadership over the East German rock community, the government did, to a certain degree, aid the development of the new music. This included allowing the import of illegal instruments via bands that desperately needed foreign equipment, as well as significant airtime given to female artists. The latter allowed for what historians consider growth in the expression of female identity and sexuality. The state also accepted the formation of more &quot;underground&quot; groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. Most notably, a number of punk and new wave bands such as Sandow and Feeling B could produce records with the official company AMIGA.

Several East German rock stars left the GDR. Nina Hagen who published her first hit &quot;Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen&quot; in 1974 emigrated in 1976. Veronika Fischer emigrated in 1981.

===Schlager===
Schlager, light popular music with roots in the nineteen and early twentieth century, which was very popular in the west, also gained a foothold early on in East Germany, and numerous musicians, such as , , and gained national fame. Frank Schöbel was very successful. From 1962 to 1976, an international schlager festival was held in Rostock, garnering participants from between 18 and 22 countries each year. The city of Dresden held a similar international festival for schlager musicians from 1971 until shortly before reunification. There was a national schlager contest hosted yearly in Magdeburg from 1966 to 1971 as well.

===Classical===
Several prestigious ensembles had roots in the pre-War period. Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra was led by Kurt Masur since 1970. The Staatskapelle Dresden was led by Herbert Blomstedt since 1975. Jean Kurt Forest established the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Chamber Orchestra in 1969, and Hartmut Haenchen led the ensemble.

Other ensembles located in East Germany included the Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin, the Berlin State Opera, the Komische Oper Berlin, the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Staatskapelle Berlin, the Konzerthausorchester Berlin (Berliner Symphony Orchestra) and the Staatskapelle Halle.

Classical music recordings were recorded issued on the Eterna Record label, a unit of the VEB Deutsche Schallplatten state music company. Many of the recordings have been issued in the 21st century on the Berlin Classics label.

===Johann Sebastian Bach===
On a more traditional level, the East German government celebrated the fact that Johann Sebastian Bach was born in East German territory, and spent a great deal of money converting his house in Eisenach into a museum of his life, which, among other things, included more than 300 instruments from Bach&#x27;s life. In 1980, this museum received more than 70,000 visitors.

In Leipzig, an enormous archive with recordings of all of Bach&#x27;s music was compiled, along with many historical documents and letters both to and from him. Werner Neumann founded the Bach-Archiv Leipzig in 1950.

Every second year, school children from across East Germany gathered for a Bach competition held in East Berlin. Every four years an international Bach competition for keyboard and strings was held.

Thomanerchor recorded a number of Bach&#x27;s works.

===Jazz===
German jazz was divided after World War II, with the East German regime having an ambivalent attitude to jazz, which it initially resisted as an American influence on culture, but later accepted as a form of &quot;people&#x27;s music&quot;.

Klaus Lenz directed a number of bands. 
Manfred Krug sang jazz till his emigration in 1977.

===Recording establishments===
There were state recording companies. In 1947 Ernst Busch established Eterna Records for classical, folk, jazz and church music. For popular music there was Amiga Records. These operations became state-directed in 1953.

==Visual art==
Artists were members of the Communist &quot;Verband Bildender Künstler der DDR&quot;.

===Visual propaganda===
Political propaganda shaped GDR – monuments of Communist leaders including Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, banners with political slogans.

===Feminist art===
Critical feminist artists were Gabriele Stötzer, Tina Bara, Cornelia Schleime, Doris Ziegler, Mita Schamal, Karla Woisnitza, Christine Schlegel, Else Gabriel, Yana Milev, Angela Hampel, Gundula Schulze Eldowy, Janet Grau.

==Political manifestations and secular ceremonies==
International Workers&#x27; Day was obligatory for millions. The &quot;Tag der Republik&quot; (the Day of the Republic), 7 October, was the anniversary of the creation of the GDR.

The Jugendweihe was a secular coming-of-age ceremony which replaced Lutheran Confirmation.

==Theatre==

East German theatre was strongly dominated in its early years by Bertolt Brecht, who brought back artists from the antifascist resistance and reopened &quot;Theater am Schiffbauerdamm&quot; with his Berliner Ensemble. On the other side some streams tried to establish &quot;Pure Workers Theatre&quot;, played by workers and performing plays about workers.

After Brecht died, there was a lot of conflict between the artists and the family (around Helene Weigel) about the Brecht heritage. Heinz Kahlau, Slatan Dudow, Erwin Geschonneck, Erwin Strittmatter, Peter Hacks, Benno Besson, Peter Palitzsch and Ekkehard Schall are counted among Brecht&#x27;s scholars and followers. In the 1950s the Swiss Benno Besson had success with &quot;The Dragon&quot; by Jewgenij Schwarz. As a result, he travelled with Deutsches Theater around Europe and Asia (and also in Japan). He became the Intendant at Volksbühne in the 1960s and often worked with Heiner Müller.

Because of censorship, many artists left the GDR from 1975 onwards. A parallel development was that some artists moved out to small city theatres, to create theatre beyond Berlin. For example, Peter Sodann founded the Neues Theater in Halle/Saale and Frank Castorf worked at a theatre in Anklam. Theatre and Cabaret had a very important status for the people in the GDR and it was a very active and dynamic scene. This was the cause of some contention with the state. Benno Besson was quoted as saying about the relationship between cabaret and the state: &quot;At least they took us seriously.&quot;

The Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin is the last major building erected by the GDR. Here, Berlin&#x27;s great revue tradition lives on, today bringing viewers state-of-the-art shows.

==Cinema==
In East Germany the movie industry was very active. Besides folk movies, the East German movie industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially for its children&#x27;s movies (&quot;Das kalte Herz&quot; and cinematic versions of the Grimms&#x27; fairy tales, and also modern productions like &quot;Das Schulgespenst&quot;).

Movies about the persecution of Jews in the Third Reich, such as &quot;Naked Among Wolves&quot;, &quot;Jakob the Liar,&quot; and the resistance against fascism, such as &quot;Fünf Patronenhülsen&quot;, (both directed by Frank Beyer), became internationally famous.
Movies about problems of daily life like &quot;Die Legende von Paul und Paula&quot; (directed by Heiner Carow) or &quot;Solo Sunny&quot; (directed by Konrad Wolf and Wolfgang Kohlhaase) were also very popular.

Red Westerns (Indianerfilme) were also made, in which American Indians often took the role of the displaced people. Gojko Mitić is the most famous actor in this role; he often played the righteous, kindhearted and charming Chief (&quot;The Sons of Great Bear&quot; directed by Josef Mach). He became an honorary chief of the Sioux nation, when he visited the United States of America in the 1990s and the accompanying television crew showed the Sioux one of his movies.

Because of censorship a number of movies were forbidden at this time, and only shown after the reunification of Germany in 1990. Examples are &quot;Trace of Stones&quot; (directed by Frank Beyer) and &quot;Divided Heaven&quot; (directed by Konrad Wolf).

East German cinemas screened domestic productions, Czech, Polish, and other Eastern European productions and some Hollywood movies, although the number of the latter was limited due to the cost of purchasing the licences. Movies which represented or glorified a capitalistic ideology were not shown. For example, &quot;Grease&quot; was not shown but &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; was. Comedies were popular, such as the Danish &quot;Olsen Gang&quot; or movies with the French comedian Louis de Funès.

One of the most well-known film critics in East Germany was , also known as &quot;Kino-Eule&quot; (&quot;Kino-Owl&quot;), who wrote for the satirical Eulenspiegel magazine.

== Television ==


There were two nationwide state TV stations, DFF1 and DFF2. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, these were gradually merged into the structures of the Federal Republic&#x27;s public broadcasting system, being followed up by Länder-based regional stations like the MDR (Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, for the three southern new federal states) and the RBB (Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg).

As the arrangement of aerials on roofs often revealed viewers that watched West German television, they could be prone to denunciation by patriotic neighbours or FDJ members, especially during the 1950s and 1960s. However, by the 1980s the authorities were largely resigned to the presence of Western broadcasts and even tolerated the existence of communal antennas and cable systems carrying both DFF and Western channels.

The DEFA was one of the largest TV production companies within the German-speaking countries and produced work that occasionally dared to feature covert criticism of the establishment.

== Material culture ==

The material culture of the GDR is the primary focus of Ostalgie (a combination of &quot;Ost&quot; (East) and &quot;Nostalgie&quot; (nostalgia)).

=== Consumerism ===

Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages an acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. The GDR&#x27;s economy produced a whole series of consumer goods and associated consumerist practices different from both West German and Soviet bloc cultures. A consumerist culture developed with (in contrast to the West relatively clear-cut) prestige allocations according to consumerist practices.

=== Architecture ===

In the early days of the GDR, modernist designs predominated. In the wake of the war&#x27;s destruction, there were several plans to reimagine cities using Bauhaus and other avant-garde designs. Among these was the plan drafted by Hans Scharoun: a collective plan for a new division and decentralization of the then undivided city of Berlin to be enacted under the auspices of the Allied Control Council. Scharoun&#x27;s vision included residential cells, criss-crossed by open, green boulevards. By the early 1950s, however, the Bauhaus blueprint for reconstruction had fallen out of favor among political elites, and projects in the modernist style stalled or were abandoned. One of the few remaining structures designed in this vein is a Bauhaus apartment block designed by Scharoun himself, in the Friedrichshain neighborhood of Berlin, on an open boulevard formerly known as Stalinallee.

The modernists&#x27; loss of popularity was largely attributable to the rise of Socialist Classicism or Stalinist Architecture (), an eclectic style that weaved together elements of national cultural heritage and traditionalist ornamentation with the comfort of contemporary architecture. What these elements might look like depended on location and varied significantly between projects completed in the various regions of the Eastern Bloc. In the GDR these national elements were usually echoes of classicism, but did allow for regional variations such as the Dresden Altmarkt, which borrows form the Baroque style, or the Brick Gothic-inspired Lange Straße in the northern port city of Rostock. Reacting to a shift in the political and economic exigencies of the time, new designs in the Stalinist style tapered off by the late 1950s. This was largely due to material scarcity; the at times lavish ornamentation of the national style met with increasing disapproval as millions still lived in overpopulated or dilapidated buildings. The advent of de-Stalinisation further suppressed demand for new Socialist Classical projects.

The architectural preferences of the 1960s and 1970s were thus shaped largely by economic necessity. The need for cheap, mass-housing led to the &quot;industrialization of architecture&quot;, in which new designs emphasized functionalism and low construction costs. Projects of this type were mostly immense concrete residential blocks, which later included prefabricated components. Although the new functionalism was a response to material scarcity, aesthetically the movement meant a return to modernist principles. Freed from the national ideological framework of Socialist Classicism, architects resurrected the Bauhaus &quot;new buildings&quot; of the 1920s. East German building templates such as the WBS 70, the P2, and the high-rise WHH GT 18/21 exemplify the aesthetic shift towards modernism, but were above all valued for their prefabricated parts that enabled quick and cost-effective construction.

Notable examples of GDR architecture are / were:
*the Karl-Marx-Allee, originally Stalinallee, with the Strausberger Platz in East Berlin
*the Prager Straße in Dresden
*the Palace of the Republic
*the Alexanderplatz, where much of the GDR buildings still shape the place
*the city-centre buildings of Leipzig&#x27;s Karl-Marx-University (now partly disassembled and partly being replaced by a post-modern building), including the City-Hochhaus Leipzig

==GDR jokes==
With widespread censorship of literature, the media and the arts, political jokes were one of the main outlets for criticism of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After reunification, these became known as &quot;DDR-Witze&quot; (GDR jokes). Political jokes of this form have almost disappeared since reunification as they no longer play the same subversive role, being replaced by open democratic debate, political cartoons and satire.

The GDR citizens referred to some of the more critical jokes as five-year-jokes (i.e., three years prison for the one telling it and two for all who listen &quot;and&quot; laugh). There is also a morphological reference to &quot;five-year-plan&quot; – in a way, talking about a five-year-joke was a &quot;meta-joke&quot;.

<text>Big Diomede Island or Tomorrow Island (; Ratmanov Island, ; ) is the western island of the two Diomede Islands in the middle of the Bering Strait. The island is home to a Russian military base which is located midway along the island&#x27;s North shore. The island is a part of the Chukotsky District of the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia. The border separating Russia and the United States runs north–south through the four-kilometer-wide strait that runs between the two Islands.

==Geography==
Big Diomede Island is located about southeast of Cape Dezhnev on the Chukchi Peninsula and is Russia&#x27;s easternmost point by direction of travel. It is west of the International Date Line, although in the western hemisphere by longitude. The coordinates are . The rocky tuya-type island has an area of about The International Date Line is about east of the island. The highest point of the island is Krysha peak standing tall. There is a weather station on the north coast at . There is a helipad at .

==History==
The island was originally inhabited by Iñupiat. The First Alaskans Institute says: &quot;The people of the Diomede and King Islands are Inupiat&quot;.

The first European to reach the islands was the Russian explorer Semyon Dezhnyov in 1648. Vitus Bering landed on the Diomede Islands on August 16, 1728, the day on which the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of the martyr St. Diomede.

In 1732, the Russian geodesist Mikhail Gvozdev plotted the island&#x27;s map.

In 1867, during the Alaska Purchase, the new border between the nations was drawn between the Big Diomede and Little Diomede islands.

===20th century===
During World War II, Big Diomede became a military base, and remained so for some time into the Cold War.

After World War II, the native population was forced off Big Diomede Island to the mainland in order to avoid contacts across the border. They first moved to the Yupik village of Naukan That village was evicted between 1954 and 1958, so residents were relocated elsewhere. In 2015, an attempt was made to reunite people from the two islands.

Today, unlike Alaska&#x27;s neighboring Little Diomede Island, it has no permanent native population, but it is the site of a Russian weather station and a base of Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation troops (FSB).

During the Cold War, the section of the border between the U.S. and the USSR separating Big and Little Diomede became known as the &quot;Ice Curtain&quot;. On 7 August 1987, however, Lynne Cox, an American long-distance swimmer, swam from Little Diomede to Big Diomede (approximately ) in ice-cold waters. She was congratulated jointly by Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan four months later at the signing of the INF Missile Treaty at the White House, when Gorbachev made a toast. He and President Reagan lifted their glasses and Gorbachev said: &quot;Last summer it took one brave American by the name of Lynne Cox just two hours to swim from one of our countries to the other. We saw on television how sincere and friendly the meeting was between our people and the Americans when she stepped onto the Soviet shore. She proved by her courage how close to each other our peoples live&quot;.

====Lisunov Li-2 crash====
On 13 June 1971 a Lisunov Li-2 belonging to the Soviet Border Troops crashed in the centre of the island. All crew members were injured but survived and the green hull remains at .

==Fauna==
Eleven species of birds including such as puffins and guillemots have been found on Big Diomede. The island, along with its surrounding waters, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significant seabird colonies, including those of horned puffins, and of parakeet, least and crested auklets. In 1976 a rufous hummingbird was identified on the island. This finding, unique so far in Russia, was very likely due to a dispersed specimen.

For mammals, pinnipeds (e.g. ringed and bearded seals, walruses) and cetaceans (e.g. gray and rarer bowhead whales) inhabit the waters around the island.

<doc id="524195" wikidata="Q1224996" url="?curid=524195" title="Little Diomede Island">
<text>Little Diomede Island or Yesterday Island (, formerly known as [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]] Island, ) is an inhabited island of Alaska. It is the smaller of the two Diomede Islands located in the Bering Strait between the Alaskan mainland and Siberia. The island has one town, also called Diomede.

==Etymology==
The Diomede Islands are named after Saint Diomedes. The Inupiaq name means &quot;the other one&quot; or &quot;the one over there&quot;. The two islands are respectively nicknamed &quot;Yesterday Island&quot; (Little Diomede Island) and &quot;Tomorrow Island&quot; (Big Diomede Island) because the International Date Line runs between them, making the date on Little Diomede Island always one day earlier than the date on Big Diomede Island.

==Geography==
Little Diomede Island is located about west of mainland Alaska, in the middle of the Bering Strait. It is only from the International Date Line and about from the Russian island of Big Diomede. According to the United States Census Bureau, the island has a total area of , all of it land. On the western shore of the island is the village of Diomede, also known as &quot;Iŋaliq&quot;. The highest point on Little Diomede Island is (about halfway along the west coast, about south-east of the village, facing the southern tip of Big Diomede). The island has very scant vegetation.

Big Diomede Island, located west of Little Diomede Island, is part of Russia. Thus the two islands are separated by an international boundary. The International Date Line also runs between the two islands. 

Big Diomede is easily seen from Little Diomede, so you can see Russia from Alaska.

===Geology===
Little Diomede island is composed of Cretaceous age granite or quartz monzonite. The location of the settlement is the only area which does not have near-vertical cliffs to the water. Behind the settlement, and around the entire island, rocky slopes rise at about 40° up to the relatively flattened top in .

===Important Bird Area===
The island, along with its surrounding waters, has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significant seabird colonies, including those of black-legged kittiwakes, and of parakeet, least and crested auklets.

===Climate===
Summer temperatures average . Winter temperatures average from . Annual precipitation averages , and annual snowfall averages . During summer months, cloudy skies and fog prevail. Winds blow consistently from the north, averaging , with gusts of . The Bering Strait is generally frozen between mid-December and mid-June.

===Demography===

As of 2021, the town of Diomede had a population of 82, down from its recorded peak of 208 in 1998. All the land on Little Diomede Island is officially within the town of Diomede (which, like the island as a whole, is also called ). The island is not part of any organized borough, so some services that are normally provided to Alaskan towns by boroughs are instead provided to it directly by the state. For census purposes, it is included in the Nome Census Area.

== History ==
Danish-Russian navigator Vitus Bering (after whom the Bering Strait is named) sighted the Diomede Islands on August 16 (O.S., August 27 N.S.), 1728, the day on which the Russian Orthodox Church celebrates the memory of Diomedes of Tarsus.

During the Cold War, the section of the border between the USA and the USSR that separates Big and Little Diomede became known as the &quot;Ice Curtain&quot;. Despite this nickname implying chilly relations, when Lynne Cox swam from Little Diomede to Big Diomede (about ) in August 1987, she was congratulated jointly by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan.

==Access==
There is a heliport, the Diomede Heliport, with regular helicopter flights. In the past, locals carved a runway into the thick ice sheet so that bush planes could deliver vital products, such as medicine and grocery supplies. Due to annual variations of the ice sheet, the runway would change position every year. However, climate change has meant that sea ice has neither been thick nor stable enough to support landing a plane safely on an ice runway (minimum required sea-ice thickness was 4.5 feet, and no open water to the north of the island), so the last Bering Air flight landed there in May 2013 and there has not been an ice runway since.

==In popular culture==
Little Diomede was featured in the first episode of &quot;Full Circle with Michael Palin&quot;, a 1997 BBC documentary series in which the broadcaster Michael Palin traversed many of the countries of the Pacific Rim. The Diomede Islands are also featured in the novel &quot;Further Tales of the City&quot;, by Armistead Maupin, and the miniseries based on the book. In addition, Alexander Armstrong visited the island as part of his 2015 series &quot;Land of the Midnight Sun&quot;. Little Diomede was also featured in the 1952 film &quot;Arctic Flight&quot;, starring Wayne Morris and Lola Albright.

<text>Harry Furniss (26 March 185414 January 1925) was a British illustrator. He established his career on the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; before moving to &quot;Punch&quot;. He also illustrated Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot;.

==Biography==
Although Furniss was born in Wexford, Ireland, he identified himself as English, his father being English and his mother Scottish. He was educated at Dublin&#x27;s Wesley College. 

His first job as an illustrator was for the &quot;Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot;, and when it was purchased by the owner of &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; he moved to that magazine. There he produced illustrations of social events such as the Boat Race, Goodwood and even the annual fancy dress ball at Brookwood Asylum, as well as acting as a special correspondent reporting on aspects of life in contemporary England, such as the scandalous divorce trial of Lady Colin Campbell. The following extract from his autobiography gives due warning that his illustrations should not always be thought of as being produced by a witness to the events depicted.
&quot;One boat race, for example, is very much like another. Some years ago I executed a panoramic series of sketches of the University Race from start to finish, and as they were urgently wanted, the drawings had to be sent in the same day. Early in the morning, before the break of fast, I found myself at Putney, rowing up to Mortlake, taking notes of the different points on the way — local colour through a fog. Getting home before the Londoners started for the scene, I was at work, and the drawings — minus the boats — were sent in shortly after the news of the race.&quot; 

After some years Furniss moved to &quot;The Graphic&quot;, initially writing and illustrating a series of supplements titled &quot;Life in Parliament&quot;, and he comments that &quot;from this time forward it would be difficult to name any illustrated paper with which I have not at sometime or other been connected&quot;.

His most famous humorous drawings were published in &quot;Punch&quot;, for which he started working in 1880, and to which he contributed over 2,600 drawings. He left &quot;Punch&quot; in 1894 when its owners discovered that he had sold one of his &#x27;Punch&#x27; drawings to Pears Soap for use in an advertising campaign.
He illustrated Lewis Carroll&#x27;s novel &quot;Sylvie and Bruno&quot; in 1889 and &quot;Sylvie and Bruno Concluded&quot; in 1893. Carroll and Furniss sometimes produced both pictures and text simultaneously. Carroll exerted strong control over Furniss&#x27; illustration, to such an extent that Furniss would pretend to be out when Carroll called at his home. After completing &quot;Sylvie and Bruno Concluded&quot; Furniss vowed never to work for the author again.

In 1890, he illustrated the Badminton Library&#x27;s volume on &quot;Golf&quot;. 

On leaving &quot;Punch&quot; Furniss brought out his own humorous magazine &quot;Lika Joko&quot;, but when this failed he moved to America where he worked as a writer and actor in the fledgling film industry and where, in 1914, he pioneered the first animated cartoon film for Thomas Edison.

His two-volume autobiography, titled &quot;The Confessions of a Caricaturist&quot; was published in 1902, and a further volume of personal recollections and anecdotes, &quot;Harry Furniss At Home&quot;, was published in 1904.

Furniss wrote and illustrated twenty-nine books of his own, including &quot;Some Victorian Men&quot; and &quot;Some Victorian Women&quot; and illustrated thirty-four works by other authors, including the complete works of Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray.

On some projects, like his illustrations for G. E. Farrow&#x27;s &quot;Wallypug&quot; books, Furniss collaborated with his daughter, fellow artist Dorothy Furniss (1879–1944).

Furniss married Marian Rogers in the Strand in 1877.

<text>Felix Doh (died 25 April 2003) was a rebel leader in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. He was the leader of the Ivorian Popular Movement of the Great West (MPIGO), based in the western town of Danané, during the civil war that was fought in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire from late 2002 to early 2003. He seems to have fought alongside Liberian mercenaries initially, but fighting later erupted between the Ivorian rebels and these mercenaries in April 2003. Doh was reportedly killed by the Liberian mercenaries, who were led by Sam Bockarie, in uncertain circumstances.

<text>Robin Curtis is an American actress. She is best known for replacing Kirstie Alley in the role of Vulcan Lieutenant Saavik in the films &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; and &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Film and television work ===
Although her first appearance as Vulcan Lieutenant Saavik in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; in 1984 was promoted as her film debut, Curtis had already made several film and made-for-television movie appearances. Her performance in the film drew a mixed reception from Trek fans. She reprised the role of Saavik for a brief appearance in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot;.

She co-starred in the 1983 episode &quot;Short Notice&quot; during the first season of the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; television series. In 1991, she portrayed Carol Pulaski on the soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In 1993, she portrayed an unrelated Vulcan character disguised as a Romulan (Tallera/T&#x27;Paal) in the two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; &quot;Gambit&quot;. In the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Deathwalker&quot; (1994), she appeared as Abbai Ambassador Kalika.

She also appeared in the television series &quot;Dream On&quot;, &quot;Herman&#x27;s Head&quot;, &quot;Night Court&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Johnny Bago&quot;, &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot;, and &quot;The Equalizer&quot;.

Curtis&#x27;s other film work includes &quot;Hexed&quot;, &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, &quot;Shootdown&quot;, &quot;In Love with an Older Woman&quot;, &quot;A White Thread, A Black Thread&quot;, and &quot;LBJ – The Early Years,&quot; where she played Jacqueline Kennedy.

In 2022, Curtis was cast in the horror film &quot;Awaken the Reaper&quot;, her first film role since 1999.

=== Stage and commercial work ===
Curtis has numerous stage credits in regional and national theatre, including &quot;Gyspy&quot;, &quot;Applause&quot;, &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and &quot;...And Other Songs&quot; in New York City. She performed in &quot;The City Suite&quot; off Broadway and in &quot;Garden&quot; in Los Angeles. Her other work includes &quot;The Nerd&quot;, &quot;The Man of La Mancha&quot;, and &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;. She has also appeared in several television commercials and infomercials.

Curtis made frequent appearances at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions in the mid-1990s, but by 2014, she was appearing only occasionally. She became a residential real estate agent in 2004 and the following year debuted her one-woman show, a work-in-progress, &quot;Not My Bra, You Don&#x27;t! – The Sexual Odyssey of a Forty-Nine-Year-Old Woman&quot;.

<doc id="524212" wikidata="Q983371" url="?curid=524212" title="Maurice Loewy">
<text>Maurice (Moritz) Loewy (15 April 1833 – 15 October 1907) was a French astronomer.

Loewy was born in Vienna. Loewy&#x27;s Jewish parents moved to Vienna in 1841 to escape the antisemitism of their home town. Loewy became an assistant at the Vienna Observatory, working on celestial mechanics. However, the institutions of Austria-Hungary did not permit a Jew to advance to a senior position without renouncing his faith and embracing Catholicism. The director of the observatory Karl L. Littrow was a correspondent of Urbain Le Verrier, director of the Paris Observatory and he secured a position there for Loewy in 1860. After going to France, Loewy become a naturalised French citizen.

He worked on the orbits of asteroids and comets and on the measurement of longitude, improving the accuracy of the &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot;. He also worked on optics and the elimination of the aberration of light.

He was elected a member of the Bureau des Longitudes in 1872 and of the Académie des Sciences in 1873.

Loewy became director of the Paris Observatory in 1896, reorganising the institution and establishing a department of physical astronomy. He further spent a decade working with Pierre Puiseux on an atlas of the Moon composed of 10,000 photographs, &quot;L’Atlas photographique de la Lune&quot; (1910), the definitive basis for lunar geography for over half a century. The crater Loewy on the Moon is named after him and asteroid 253 Mathilde is believed to be named after his wife.

He died in Paris at a government meeting of a sudden and unanticipated cardiac arrest.

<doc id="524214" wikidata="Q7337301" url="?curid=524214" title="River Coquet">
<text>The River Coquet runs through the county of Northumberland, England, discharging into the North Sea on the east coast at Amble. It rises in the Cheviot Hills on the border between England and Scotland, and follows a winding course across the landscape (&quot;Coquetdale&quot;). The upper reaches are bordered by the Otterburn Ranges military training ground, and are crossed by a number of bridges built in the 20th century. It passes a number of small villages and hamlets, and feeds one of the lakes created by extraction of gravel that form the Caistron Nature Reserve, before reaching the town of Rothbury, where it is crossed by a grade II listed bridge. Below the town is Thrum Mill, a Grade II-listed water mill.

It loops around Brinkburn Priory, founded in the 1130s for Augustinian Canons, and its associated mill. At Felton it is crossed by two bridges, one dating from the 15th century, and its replacement, built in 1927, both of which are listed structures. Below the bridges is a sewage treatment works, built in the 1990s. At Brainshaugh, the river passes over a large horseshoe dam, built in 1775 by the engineer John Smeaton to power an iron and tin works, which later became a woollen mill, and subsequently one of the first factories to be powered by hydroelectricity. Before it reaches Warkworth, the river passes over another dam, which is now part of the intake works for Warkworth Water Treatment Works, which supplies drinking water to some 92,000 customers in the region. Below the dam the river is tidal, and Warkworth Castle is built in a loop of the Coquet. The river reaches the sea at Warkworth Harbour in Amble, where there is a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat station.

The river has been used as a source of power, as a number of mills have been constructed along its length. One of the earliest was on Hepden Burn, a tributary in the upper reaches, which was mentioned in the early 13th century, but was not subsequently developed, due to unrest in the area. Archaeological investigation between 2010 and 2013 revealed one of the few unaltered medieval mill sites in Britain, and pushed the development of the breast-shot water wheel back by three centuries. Although most of the mills were used for grinding corn, some were used for fulling of wool, and that at Brainshaugh for an industrial process. The earliest was at Warkworth, the rent from which was used to provide a light in St Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine in 1214.

The earliest known reference to the River Coquet is found in the Ravenna Cosmography, which dates from the 8th century. The water quality of the non-tidal river is good ecologically, and only in the final tidal section is the water affected by run-off from agricultural land, reducing the quality to moderate.

==Course==
The river, which is about in length, rises in the Cheviot Hills close to the contour, to the east of Grindstone Law and to the north of Ravens Knowe. The border between England and Scotland follows it briefly, before turning northwards at Chew Green, where there are the remains of Roman camps on the north bank of the river, the course of Dere Street, locally named as Camelspath, crosses the river, and there are the remains of the medieval village of Kemylpethe. The river continues in a north-easterly direction, where it is joined by Fulhope Burn, Buckham&#x27;s Walls Burn, Blind Burn and Gable Burn, before it reaches Carshope plantation. It turns to the east, to be joined by Carlcroft Burn, Rowhope Burn and Hepden Burn, and after passing between Barrow Law to the north and Tindale Law to the south, the river turns to the south. The area to the south of the river forms part of the Otterburn Ranges, which has been used as a military training ground since 1911. It is owned by the Ministry of Defence, and public access is restricted.

The Deerbush Burn joins the Dumbhope Burn before they join the Coquet, and the river turns to the south-east, to be joined by Croft Sike and Pathlaw Sike, draining boggy areas to the south, while Usway Burn and Wholehope Burn drain hilly areas to the north. When it reaches the hamlet of Linbriggs, it is joined by the Ridlees Burn and turns to the east. At the village of Alwinton, the Barrow Burn, Hosedon Burn and River Alwin all converge, and the Coquet continues in a south-easterly direction through Harbottle, where there is a Neolithic enclosure and several Bronze Age cairns. At Sharperton, the ford was replaced by a bridge around 1896, since the bridge and a weir just downstream of it appears on the 1897 map, but a ford appears on the 1895 map. The bridge was rebuilt in 1920 using concrete beams, with six spans and parapets with latticework.

The upper Coquet above Alwinton is crossed by a number of bridges, all dating from a bridge-building programme in the 20th century, as prior to 1928, fords were the main means of crossing the channel on this section. Linbriggs Bridge was the first of the new bridges, and consists of a concrete arch spanning a gorge. Subsequent bridges were built with flat decks, and the programme was completed in 1968, when Mackendon Bridge was opened. The 1897 Ordnance Survey map shows three suspension bridges carrying footpaths over the river. There is one at Linbriggs, a second a short distance below Linbriggs and a third at Harbottle.

The Holystone Burn joins the Coquet at Holystone. The village has a Holy Well, with a rectangular stone tank dating from Roman times, but the fact that Bishop Paulinus baptized around 3000 Northumbrians there in the year 627 is now thought to be based on a misreading of the writings of Bede. The well is a grade I listed structure, and there is a Roman road which passed through the well enclosure and then crossed the Coquet on its way from High Rochester fort to the River Aln.

There was a fourth suspension bridge near Hepple, made of iron with a span, which cost £30 when it was constructed. By the time the river reaches Hepple bridge, which consists of modern steel beams resting on piers dating from around 1874, it has dropped below the contour. It turns to the north-east, and then passes the hamlet of Caistron, where there are two large lakes caused by extraction of sand and gravel, which started in 1956. The largest lake covers , and is managed as a nature reserve and fishery. Traffic from the quarry crossed a curious bridge, which consists of large metal tubes laid onto the bed of the river, above which the roadway has been constructed. The river channel has been engineered to make way for the quarrying, as it looped further to the south in 1925, and to the north-east of the first lake is a second smaller lake, fed by the river. Water supply to the upper lake is from Bickerton Burn.

===Middle section===

The river continues to the south of Thropton where Wreigh Burn joins from the north, and passes through Rothbury, where a bridge dating from the 16th century crosses it. Built as a packhorse bridge, it was made wider in 1759 by William Oliphant, a mason from Rothbury, to accommodate vehicles, and was further widened in the 20th century, when the parapets were removed and a concrete deck constructed on top of the original structure. Unlike many bridges, the earlier phases have not been concealed by later work. It is a scheduled monument and a grade II listed structure. Below Rothbury is a velocity-area gauging station, which measures the river&#x27;s flow. Its accuracy is enhanced by a mill weir further downstream, and it has been used to collect flow data since 1972. The mean flow between 1972 and 2005 was , but the maximum flow during this period was on 1 April 1992. Just to the east is Thrum Mill, a grade II listed three-storey mill building dating from the 18th and 19th centuries the restoration of which was featured in the Channel 4 television programme &quot;The Restoration Man&quot;. From 1870 the Rothbury Branch of the Northumberland Central Railway ran along the south bank of the river on its final approach to . Passenger services ceased in 1952 and goods services were withdrawn in 1963. The river continues through the hamlet of Pauperhaugh, where there is a bridge with three segmental arches and a weir on the downstream side. It then loops around a finger of land, which was given by its owner, William Bertram lord of Mitford, to Augustinian canons between 1130 and 1135, who founded Brinkburn Priory. After the dissolution of the monasteries, the main building was derelict until 1858, when it was re-roofed and partly rebuilt, to be used as a parish church. Parts of the original buildings were incorporated into a manor house, which was occupied intermittently until 1953, after which it was given to the Ministry of Public Building and Works. Both the church and the house are now managed by English Heritage and are open for public viewing. Nearby is Brinkburn Mill, built in the 18th century, but re-using medieval masonry. A cottage for the miller was added around 1830. The wheel and stones remain, although it is now used as holiday accommodation.

After passing through Weldon, where there is a mill and a three-arched bridge dating from 1760, which is thought to have been designed by the engineer John Smeaton, the Coquet is crossed by the A1 road. As it approaches Felton, there is a dam, from which a long rock-cut leat on the north bank supplied Felton corn mill. This was first mentioned in the 13th century, but the present building dates from the 18th and 19th centuries. An undershot water wheel drove four sets of stones, used for milling corn, while a second breast-shot wheel drove an oat mill, with two sets of stones, a rotary kiln and a pearl barley machine. There was once a sawmill powered by a third wheel. The site was operational until 1970, but was subsequently converted into homes, and the wheels were broken up. At Felton, the river turns to the north-east, and is crossed by two bridges. The first dates from the 15th century, and has three arches. It was widened in the 19th and 20th centuries, but was disused after 1927, when a new concrete bridge by Considere Constructions, also with three spans, was built to replace it. It is grade II listed because it is one of the earliest bridges of its type produced by the company. Beyond the bridges, a new sewage treatment works was built on the north bank, after it was authorised in 1991. It was designed to discharge of treated effluent to the river each day, and replaced old inefficient works at Felton, Longframlington, Swarland and Thirston.

Near Brainshaugh, the river passes over a horseshoe dam, built in 1775 by John Smeaton for John Archbold of Acton and Edward Cook of Brainshaugh. It is built of squared stone, and was repaired and modified in 1926. The downstream face is vertical, and the water falls . The curved dam has a radius of and supplied a mill race to the south of the river. This originally powered an iron and tin foundry, subsequently converted to a woollen mill in 1791, and becoming derelict in 1884. From 1915, it was used to manufacture a white pigment called Hydrate of Alumina, and became one of the first factories in the country to be powered by hydroelectric power when a Gilkes water turbine was fitted into the millrace. The factory closed in 1930 when its lease was not renewed following pollution of the river. The mill building was converted into flats in 1968. At the eastern end of the site is Factory Bridge, consisting of three segmental arches, which was built of rock-faced stone in 1865. Some railings were added in the 20th century.

===Lower River===

Further downstream near Guyzance are the ruins of Brainshaugh Priory, which was established by Richard Tison around 1147 for Premonstratensian nuns. The community had disbanded by 1500, but the chapel remains, and is a grade II* listed structure. Another large dam provided the water supply for Guyzance Mill, on the west bank of the river. The main building has three storeys, and the undershot water wheel is located inside the building, although it may have been external when first built. Some of the machinery and the stones remain in situ. The East Coast Main Line crosses the river on a railway viaduct with nine arches, designed in Robert Stephenson and completed in 1849 or 1850. The river passes over the weir of Morwick Mill, and a little further downstream is Morwick gauging station, which has been collecting data since 1963. It uses velocity area technology, and there is a wide concrete weir, which dates from 1973. The station replaced one at Guyzance, and while the measurements are good for most of the year, they are briefly inaccurate when the Morwick Mill weir is drained and flushed once a year. Mean flow between 1963 and 2005 was , with a high of on 1 April 1992. Just to the west of Warkworth the river passes over a large weir, beyond which the water is tidal. The weir is bypassed by a fish pass, consisting of a series of pools with small jumps between them. The fish pass was refurbished in 2013 after lying derelict for 20 years, to prevent harm to salmon, sea trout and eels, which were being injured while trying to negotiate the main weir. On the south bank is Warkworth Water Treatment Works, which takes of water from the river each day to supply potable water to 92,000 customers in Alnwick, Morpeth, Ashington and the surrounding areas. A £2.2 million upgrade to the plant was completed in 2015.
On the north bank below the weir is a cave hermitage, which dates from the 14th and early 15th centuries. It was abandoned by 1567, but remains one of the best preserved and elaborate monuments of its type in the British Isles, and is a grade I listed structure. On the tidal section, a loop to the north encloses the centre of Warkworth, including its medieval castle and church. Below Warkworth is Amble half-tide weir, which maintains water levels through Warkworth when the tide is low, but is submerged at high tide. It has a central notch and a fish pass near the southern bank. In 2018, the flow through the notch was decreased, and that down the fish pass increased, as fish tended to use the notch, where they were caught in large numbers by seals. Below the weir the channel widens to form Warkworth Harbour, with the town of Amble on the south bank. There is a marina and a Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat station, which houses two lifeboats, a Shannon-class all-weather boat propelled by water jets, and a D-class inflatable boat for inshore work. The crew have received 18 awards for gallantry between them, including the first ever awarded for a rescue by an inshore boat. Finally the river enters the North Sea, almost opposite Coquet Island, located out to sea.

==Mills==
For most of England, the Domesday Book which was produced in 1086 provides the first comprehensive survey of mills, but the Domesday survey did not cover Northumberland or County Durham, and so documentary records for the Coquet are not available from that period. The first known records are from the 12th century, when water mills were normally owned by the Lord of the Manor or by Religious establishments. While most mills were used for grinding corn, they were also employed in the fulling of wool. This process, which removed grease and other impurities from the woollen fabric and knitted the fibres together to form a denser product, was a manual one until the 12th century, with the cloth put into tubs and trampled by foot, before it was washed in a stream. The fulling mill used a rotating shaft with cams to raise and drop mallets onto the cloth, which was immersed in tubs. The Newminster Chartulary, which records the activities of a Cistercian abbey near Morpeth lists two fulling mills on the Coquet, including one between Rowhope Burn and Hepden Burn. This is thought to have been on the Hepden Burn, a tributary which was known as Barrow Burn in 1866, and the mill site is now known as Barrowburn. Archaeological investigation of the site was carried out between 2010 and 2013 by members of Coquetdale Community Archaeology.

As some time between 1226 and 1245, the monks of Newminster Abbey were granted a licence to erect a fulling mill at Barrowburn. They also built dykes to mark the boundaries of the land they had been given. It is not clear how long the mill was operational, as there are no further documentary records, and the area was turbulent with Scottish incursions in the 14th century, which may have contributed to its demise, but the site of the mill was identified by Dippie Dixon in 1903. The archaeological investigations found the remains of a wheel pit for a breast-shot water wheel, and a wooden structure in the river bed which was probably part of a sluice. The wheel was unusual, since documentary evidence for breast-shot wheels begins in the 16th century, but the finds push their history back by three centuries. The unrest in the area may have had unexpected consequences, as the site was never developed subsequently, and is one of very few medieval mill sites to be excavated in Britain.

Barrow Mill was a corn mill located upstream of Alwinton, and was first documented in 1712. It is shown with a large weir, a sluice feeding a mill race, and an exit leat on an 1895 map, but only the buildings are shown by 1897. It was built on lands owned by Holystone Priory, and appears to have been disused by 1887. Although there is no evidence from early Ordnance Survey maps for further mills above Rothbury, there were two mills at Alwinton in 1623, one of which may have been a fulling mill, as a fulling mill was confiscated from Sir Edward Widdrington in 1654. Widdrington also lost a corn mill and a fulling mill at Harbottle, which were sold in 1655, but later recovered following the Restoration. There were two mills at Holystone, a corn mill which was mentioned when Holystone Nunnery was dissolved in 1539, and Holystone Walk Mill, both of which are shown on a map dating from 1765. A fulling mill at Caistron was the other mill on the Coquet mentioned in the Newminster Chartulary, and there was at least one mill at Tosson, as a corn mill was documented in 1290 and 1436, but a fulling mill was mentioned in 1622.
There were four mills at various times in Rothbury. Debdon Mill was a woollen mill on the Debdon Burn, and was first documented in 1762. It was shown on the Ordnance Survey map of 1879, but not on that of 1897. East Mill was a corn mill of unknown date, located just upstream from the site of Thrum Mill. Thrum Mill itself is known to have existed before 1841, while Little Mill dates from 1827, and was located just below the confluence with Whitton Burn. Both were corn mills. Brinkburn Mill, which was owned by Brinkburn Priory, was documented in 1535, and although its main function was grinding corn, it may also have been used to generate electricity in the 20th century. Wheldon Mill was another corn mill first documented in 1668. It was just upstream of Wheldon Bridge, and the downstream mill race rejoined the river below the bridge. At Felton, there is a mill upstream of the bridges, which was operational until 1970, and another just below the bridge, of which there is no trace.

Smeaton&#x27;s dam at Guyzance fed the iron and tin works, which was later converted to a woollen mill, producing blankets. Guyzance Mill was a corn mill further downstream, which may have been used as a fulling mill in its early days. It is first attested to in 1336. There was also a corn mill on the Hazon Burn, which joins the Coquet just below Smeaton&#x27;s weir. Hazon Mill was near the hamlet of Hazon, and was documented in the 16th century. Morwick Mill, on the outskirts of Warkworth, was a corn mill first documented in 1284. The weir is still extant, and the modern map shows a mill cottage, but not the mill itself. Warkworth Mill was one of the earliest on the river, as the rent from it was used to provide a light in St Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine in 1214, and this was still the arrangement in 1400. Two mills were recorded at the site in 1567 and 1607, while the last record of rents being collected was in 1855. The building was damaged by fire in 1860, and was probably not used afterwards. A number of buildings remain, although not the mill building, while the weir has been incorporated into the intake works for Warkworth Water Treatment Works. There were also two mills on Grange Burn, a tributary that joins the Coquet above Warkworth Mill site. Grange Mill was near the medieval village of Low Buston, and Houndean Mill was just to the east of the railway bridge over the burn.

==History==
The earliest known reference to the River Coquet is found in the 8th century Ravenna Cosmography, where it is known as &quot;Coccuueda&quot;. Bede referred to &quot;Cocuedi fluminis&quot;. This can be roughly translated to &#x27;Red River&#x27;, perhaps reflecting the red porphyritic pebbles found here in large numbers. Alternatively, a recent emerging theory proposes the river took its name in the Anglo-Saxon period after an area of land between the Coquet and river Wansbeck called the &quot;Cocwudu&quot; meaning &quot;cock wood&quot;, with the river therefore taking its name via a process of back-formation.

The area provides the background to William Gibson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Sailor or the Coquet Cottage&quot;. This and other poems, some in the Scottish dialect, were published in 1828. Copies of this very rare book are in the British Library and also in the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s library at Alnwick Castle.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Coquet system was as follows in 2019.

The reasons for the tidal section being less than good are physical modification of the channel and run-off of nutrients from agricultural land. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Tobias Hume (possibly 1579 – 16 April 1645) was a Scottish composer, viol player and soldier.

Little is known of his life. Some have suggested that he was born in 1579 because he was admitted to the London Charterhouse in 1629, a prerequisite to which was being at least 50 years old, though there is no certainty over this. He had made his living as a professional soldier, serving as an officer with the Swedish and Russian armies.

His published music includes pieces for viols (including many solo works for the lyra viol) and songs. They were gathered in two collections, &quot;The First Part of Ayres&quot; (or &quot;Musicall Humors&quot;, 1605) and &quot;Captain Humes Poeticall Musicke&quot; (1607). He was a particular champion of the viol over the then-dominant lute, something which caused John Dowland to publish a rebuttal of Hume&#x27;s ideas.

Hume was also known as a prankster, as some of his somewhat unusual compositions illustrate. His most notorious piece was &quot;An Invention for Two to Play upone one Viole&quot;, also known as Prince&#x27;s Almayne. Two bows are required and the smaller of the two players is obliged to sit in the lap of the larger player. This work was notated in tablature and is indeed technically possible to play. His instructions to &quot;drum this with the backe of your bow&quot; in another piece, &quot;Harke, harke,&quot; from the &quot;First Part of Ayres&quot;, constitute the earliest known use of &quot;col legno&quot; in Western music.

At Christmas 1629 he entered Charterhouse as a poor brother. His mind seems to have given way, for in July 1642 he published a rambling &quot;True Petition of Colonel Hume&quot; to parliament offering either to defeat the rebels in Ireland with a hundred &#x27;instruments of war,&#x27; or, if furnished with a complete navy, to bring the king within three months twenty millions of money. He styles himself &#x27;colonel,&#x27; but the rank was probably of his own invention, for in the entry of his death, which took place at Charterhouse on Wednesday, 16 April 1645, he is still called Captain Hume.

==In popular culture==
Tobias Hume is the main character of the novel &quot;Loot and Loyalty&quot; written by Jerzy Pietrkiewicz.

<text>Fayetteville State University (FSU) is a public historically black university in Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States. It is part of the University of North Carolina System and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund.

==History==
The second oldest state-supported school in North Carolina had humble beginnings. Immediately following the Civil War in 1865, a robust education agenda was begun in Fayetteville&#x27;s African American community with the founding of the Phillips and Sumner Schools for primary and intermediate learning. In 1867, the schools consolidated to form the Howard School, following the vision of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau chief General Oliver O. Howard who erected a building on a tract of land generously donated by seven prominent African American men – Matthew N. Leary, Andrew J. Chestnutt, Robert Simmons, George Grainger, Thomas Lomax, Nelson Carter, and David A. Bryant – who together paid $136 for two lots on Gillespie Street in Fayetteville and formed among themselves a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees to maintain the property for the education of local black youth.
In 1877, an act of the North Carolina legislature provided for the establishment of the first teacher-training institution for African Americans in the state. Recognized for its successful record of educating black youth, the Howard School was selected for this designation and in that year became the State Colored Normal School and the first state-sponsored institution for the education of African American teachers in the South.

Following a succession of leaders, in 1883, Dr. Ezekiel Ezra Smith, a graduate of Shaw Collegiate Institute (later Shaw University) in Raleigh, N.C., was appointed Principal and Chief Administrative Officer of the State Colored Normal School and began a fifty-year commitment of leadership and affiliation interrupted only by opportunities to honorably serve his country – once as Resident Minister and Consul General of the United States to Liberia and later as Regimental Adjutant of the Third North Carolina Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish–American War. During his distinguished tenure, Dr. Smith oversaw the school&#x27;s move to a permanent site on Murchison Road and personally deeded additional land to bring its holdings to 92 acres, including a physical plant of several major buildings and cottages. It was also under his leadership that, in 1929, all high school work was suspended, and the title of Principal changed to president. On June 30, 1933, Dr. Smith retired and became the school&#x27;s first President Emeritus.
Following Dr. Smith&#x27;s retirement, Dr. J. Ward Seabrook assumed the presidency of what would, under his leadership, become Fayetteville State Teachers College in 1939, a state and regionally accredited four-year college granting the Bachelor of Science degree in education. Later, in 1959, under the presidency of Dr. Rudolph Jones, a revision of the school&#x27;s charter authorized a curricular expansion to include programs leading to degrees outside the teaching field. It was also during Dr. Jones&#x27; presidency that the school became Fayetteville State College in 1963 and significant additions were made to the physical plant to accommodate a rapidly growing enrollment.
In 1969, Dr. Charles Lyons Jr. became president and in that year the college was formally renamed Fayetteville State University and designated a regional university by an act of the state legislature. Later, in 1972, Dr. Lyons became the first chancellor of FSU when it was made a constituent institution of The University of North Carolina by legislative act. It was also under the chancellorship of Dr. Lyons that the school became a Comprehensive Level I institution offering a variety of baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degree programs. Additionally, several innovative initiatives sprang forth under the leadership of Dr. Lyons including the Fort Bragg-Pope Air Force Base Extension Center that, in collaboration with the newly established Weekend and Evening College, provided military personnel and other full-time employees the opportunity to further their education.
In 1988, Dr. Lloyd Hackley was named chancellor of FSU and began an active pursuit of initiatives to further expand both undergraduate and graduate program offerings, including the establishment of the university&#x27;s first doctoral program in Educational Leadership in 1994. Continuing the spirit of innovation pioneered by his predecessors, Dr. Hackley strengthened FSU&#x27;s commitment to community outreach with programs aimed at at-risk children in the public schools and oversaw the completion of the university&#x27;s first major public capital campaign to increase privately funded scholarships available to students. Upon his departure from FSU, Dr. Hackley became the first African American President of the North Carolina Community College System.
Another first for the university came in 2003 when Dr. Thelma Jane &quot;T.J.&quot; Bryan was elected by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors to become the first female chancellor of the school and the first African American woman to head a UNC institution. Under her leadership, the university greatly expanded undergraduate and graduate program offerings, secured important specialized accreditations, and became third in the UNC system in distance-learning enrollments. In 2008, Bryan was succeeded by Dr. James Anderson. Upon the departure of Dr. Anderson, Dr. Peggy Valentine was appointed Acting Chancellor in July 2019. In March 2021, Darrell T. Allison was selected as the 12th chief executive officer and Chancellor of Fayetteville State University.

<text>Brodmann area 6 (BA6) is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to the primary motor cortex (BA4), it is composed of the premotor cortex and, medially, the supplementary motor area (SMA). This large area of the frontal cortex is believed to play a role in planning complex, coordinated movements.

Brodmann area 6 is also called agranular frontal area 6 in humans because it lacks an internal granular cortical layer (layer IV). It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined precentral region of cerebral cortex. In the human brain, it is located on the portions of the precentral gyrus that are not occupied by Brodmann area 4; furthermore, BA6 extends onto the caudal portions of the superior frontal and middle frontal gyri. It extends from the cingulate sulcus on the medial aspect of the hemisphere to the lateral sulcus on the lateral aspect. It is bounded rostrally by the granular frontal region and caudally by the gigantopyramidal area 4 (Brodmann, 1909).

==Other animals==
Brodmann area 6 is a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon. Brodmann-1909 regarded it as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the human agranular frontal area 6 and noted that, in the monkey, area 4 is larger than area 6, whereas, in the human, area 6 is larger than area 4. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): It is thick relative to other cortical areas; the transition from cortex to subcortical white matter is gradual; cell layers are indistinct; and the internal granular layer (IV) is absent.

<text>Brodmann area 8 is one of Brodmann&#x27;s cytologically defined regions of the brain. It is involved in planning complex movements.

==Human==
Brodmann area 8, or BA8, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to the premotor cortex (BA6), it includes the frontal eye fields (so-named because they are believed to play an important role in the control of eye movements). Damage to this area, by stroke, trauma or infection, causes tonic deviation of the eyes towards the side of the injury. This finding occurs during the first few hours of an acute event such as cerebrovascular infarct (stroke) or hemorrhage (bleeding).

==Guenon==
The term Brodmann area 8 refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal lobe of the guenon. Located rostral to the arcuate sulcus, it was not considered by Brodmann-1909 to be topographically homologous to the intermediate frontal area 8 of the human.

Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): compared to Brodmann area 6-1909, area 8 has a diffuse but clearly present internal granular layer (IV); sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) has densely distributed medium-sized pyramidal cells; the internal pyramidal layer (V) has larger ganglion cells densely distributed with some granule cells interspersed; the external granular layer (II) is denser and broader; cell layers are more distinct; the abundance of cells is somewhat greater.

==Functions==
The area is involved in eye movements and possibly in the management of uncertainty. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated that Brodmann area 8 activation occurs when test subjects experience uncertainty, and that with increasing uncertainty there is increasing activation.

An alternative interpretation is that this activation in the frontal cortex encodes hope, a higher-order expectation positively correlated with uncertainty.

<text>A suncake, or &quot;taiyang bing&quot;, is a popular Taiwanese dessert originally from the city of Taichung, in central Taiwan. The typical fillings consist of maltose (condensed malt sugar), and they are usually sold in special gift boxes as souvenirs for visitors. Some famous suncake pastry shops always have long lines of people waiting to buy boxed suncakes.

Suncakes are round, and they may vary in size. They are characterized by flaky crusts. Most people eat them with tea, and some people dissolve them in hot water to make a porridge-like dessert.

==Origin==
The first suncakes were made by the Lin family in the Shekou area of Shengang Township, Taichung County (now part of Taichung City). The Lin family used condensed malt sugar as a filling for cake pastries. Later, pastry maker Wei Qing-hai modified the cakes to their current form.

Though not originally called &quot;suncakes&quot;, they were given the name by the owner of &quot;Sun Booth&quot;, one of the most famous pastry shops that sells them. The name was not trademarked, and other pastry shops have used the same name for their own suncakes.

<text>Guðmundur Gíslason Hagalín (Lokinhömrum in Arnarfjörthur, October 10, 1898 – Akranesi, February 26, 1985) was an Icelandic writer who came from the sea-girt Western Fiords of Iceland, where he was a fisherman before attending secondary school. Later, he lectured on Iceland in Norway for a few years (1924–27), and became a superintendent of public libraries. His home was fairly near Reykjavík. His best work concerned portrayals of the simple sturdy seamen and countryfolk of his native region, which are often refreshingly arch in manner. He tended to do this better in short form than long. Hagalín also did well as a narrator able to capture the living speech and characteristic mode of expression of his characters. &quot;Strandbúar&quot; is one of his collections of short stories. He also had success in recording and editing biographies of very diverse people, based on first-hand accounts of their own lives. In 1960 he was still alive and working on his autobiography.

<text>Brodmann area 9, or BA9, refers to a cytoarchitecturally defined portion of the frontal cortex in the brain of humans and other primates. Its cytoarchitecture is referred to as granular due to the concentration of granule cells in layer IV. It contributes to the dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex.

==Functions==
The area is involved in short term memory, evaluating recency, overriding automatic responses, verbal fluency, error detection, auditory verbal attention, inferring the intention of others, inferring deduction from spatial imagery, inductive reasoning, attributing intention, sustained attention involved in counting a series of auditory stimuli, and displays lower levels of energy consumption in individuals suffering from bipolar disorder.

The area found on the left hemisphere is at least partially responsible for empathy, idioms, processing pleasant and unpleasant emotional scenes, self criticisms and attention to negative emotions.

On the right hemisphere the region is involved in attributing intention, theory of mind, suppressing sadness, working memory, spatial memory, recognition, recall, recognizing the emotions of others, planning, calculation, semantic and perceptual processing of odors, religiosity, and attention to positive emotions.

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 9 also exists in the frontal lobe of the guenon. Brodmann-1909 regarded it on the whole as topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the granular frontal area 9 and frontopolar area 10 in the human. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): Unlike Brodmann area 6 (Brodmann-1909), area 9 has a distinct internal granular layer (IV); unlike Brodmann area 6 or Brodmann area 8 (Brodmann-1909), its internal pyramidal layer (V) is divisible into two sublayers, an outer layer 5a of densely distributed medium-size ganglion cells that partially merges with layer IV, and an inner, clearer, cell-poor layer 5b; the pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) are smaller and sparser in distribution; the external granular layer (II) is narrow, with small numbers of sparsely distributed granule cells.

<text>Brodmann area 10 (BA10, frontopolar prefrontal cortex, rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, or anterior prefrontal cortex) is the anterior-most portion of the prefrontal cortex in the human brain. BA10 was originally defined broadly in terms of its cytoarchitectonic traits as they were observed in the brains of cadavers, but because modern functional imaging cannot precisely identify these boundaries, the terms anterior prefrontal cortex, rostral prefrontal cortex and frontopolar prefrontal cortex are used to refer to the area in the most anterior part of the frontal cortex that approximately covers BA10—simply to emphasize the fact that BA10 does not include &quot;all&quot; parts of the prefrontal cortex.

BA10 is the largest cytoarchitectonic area in the human brain. It has been described as &quot;one of the least well understood regions of the human brain&quot;. Present research suggests that it is involved in strategic processes in memory recall and various executive functions. During human evolution, the functions in this area resulted in its expansion relative to the rest of the brain.

==Anatomy==

===Size ===
The volume of the human BA10 is about 14 cm3 and constitutes roughly 1.2% of total brain volume. This is twice what would be expected in a hominoid with a human-sized brain. By comparison, the volume of BA10 in bonobos is about 2.8 cm3, and makes up only 0.74% of its brain volume. In each hemisphere, area 10 contains an estimated 250 million neurons.

===Location===
BA10 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. It occupies the most rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. In humans, on the medial aspect of the hemisphere it is bounded ventrally by the superior rostral sulcus. It does not extend as far as the cingulate sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, caudally by the middle frontal area 46, and ventrally by the orbital area 47 and by the rostral area 12 or, in an early version of Brodmann&#x27;s cortical map (Brodmann-1909), the prefrontal Brodmann area 11-1909.

Area 10 lies underneath the air filled frontal sinus of the skull, which has limited electrophysiology research until 2009.

===Relation to frontal pole ===
In humans the frontal pole area of the prefrontal cortex includes not only area 10 but part of BA 9. BA 10 also extends beyond the pole area into its ventromedial side. In Guenon monkeys, the pole area is filled by BA 12 (and its BA 10 is found in the orbital prefrontal region).

===Cytoarchitecture===

In humans the six cortical layers of area 10 have been described as having a &quot;remarkably homogeneous appearance&quot;. All of them are readily identified. Relative to each other, layer I is thin to medium in width making up 11% of the depth of area 10. Layer II is thin and contains small granular and pyramidal medium to dark staining cells (in terms of Nissl staining) which colors RNA and DNA. The widest layer is III. Its pyramidal neurons are smaller nearer the above layer II than the below layer IV. Like layer II its cells are medium to dark. Layers II and III make up 43% of the cortex depth. Layer IV has clear borders with layers III above and V below and it is thin. Its cells are pale to medium in staining. Layer V is wide and contains two distinct sublayers, Va and Vb. The density of cells Va is greater than in Vb and have darker staining. Layers IV and V make up 40% of cortical thickness. Layer VI below layer V and above the white matter contains dark pyramidal and fusiform neurons. It contributes 6% of area 10 thickness.

Area 10 differs from the adjacent Brodmann 9 in that the latter has a more distinct layer Vb and more prominent layer II. Neighbouring Brodmann area 11 compared to area 10 has a thinner layer IV with more prominent layers Va, Vb and II.

Area 10 in humans has the lowest neuron density among primate brains. It is also unusual in that its neurons have particularly extensive arborization and are highly dense with dendritic spines. This situation has been suggested to enable integration of inputs from multiple areas.

===Subareas===
BA 10 is divided into three sub-areas, 10p, 10m and 10r. 10p
occupies the frontal pole while the other two cover the ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex. Area 10m has thin layers II and IV and a more prominent layer V. In contrast, area 10r has a prominent layer II and a thicker layer IV. Large pyramidal cells are also present in 10r layer III and even more so in area 10p. But it is noted that the &quot;differences between the three
areas are gradual, however, and it is difficult to draw sharp boundaries between them&quot;. Medial frontopolar (Area 10m) cortex also contains fewer parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons relative to other frontal lobe regions, especially Area 14 in orbitofrontal cortex and Area 46 in PFC.

===Connections===
Research upon primates suggests that area 10 has inputs and output connections with other higher-order association cortex areas particularly in the prefrontal cortex while having few with primary sensory or motor areas. Its connections through the extreme capsule link it to the auditory and multisensory areas of the superior temporal sulcus. They also continue in the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the white matter of the superior temporal gyrus areas on the superior temporal gyrus (areas TAa, TS2, and TS3) and nearby multisensory areas on the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (TPO). Another area connected through the extreme capsule is the ventral region of the insula. Connections through the cingulate fasciculus link area 10 to the anterior, posterior cingulate cortex, and retrosplenial cortex. The uncinate fasciculus connects it with the amygdala, temporopolar proisocortex and anterior most part of the superior temporal gyrus. There are no connections to the parietal cortex, occipital cortex nor inferotemporal cortex

Its connections have been summarized as &quot;it seems not to be interconnected with ‘downstream’ areas in the way that other prefrontal areas are. .. it is the only prefrontal region that is predominantly (and possibly exclusively) interconnected with supramodal cortex in the PFC, anterior temporal cortex and cingulate cortex.&quot; It has been proposed that due to this connectivity that it can &quot;play a major role in the highest level of integration of information coming from visual, auditory, and somatic sensory systems to achieve amodal, abstract, conceptual interpretation of the environment .. and may be the anatomical basis for the suggested role of the rostral prefrontal cortex in influencing abstract information processing and the integration of the outcomes of multiple cognitive operations&quot;.

==Evolution==

Katerina Semendeferi and colleagues has suggested that &quot;During hominid evolution, area 10 underwent a couple of .. changes: one involves a considerable increase in overall size, and the other involves a specific increase in connectivity, especially with other higher-order association areas.&quot;

Cranial endocasts taken from the inside of the skull of &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; show an expansion in the frontal polar region suggesting enlargement in its Brodmann&#x27;s area 10.

==Function==
Although this region is extensive in humans, its function is poorly understood. Koechlin &amp; Hyafil have proposed that processing of &#x27;cognitive branching&#x27; is the core function of the frontopolar cortex. Cognitive branching enables a previously running task to be maintained in a pending state for subsequent retrieval and execution upon completion of the ongoing one. Many of our complex behaviors and mental activities require simultaneous engagement of multiple tasks, and they suggest the anterior prefrontal cortex may perform a domain-general function in these scheduling operations. Thus, the frontopolar cortex shares features with the central executive in Baddeley&#x27;s model of working memory. However, other hypotheses have also been proffered, such as those by Burgess &quot;et al.&quot;. These also take into consideration the influence of the limbic system, to which the frontopolar cortex is connected through the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. A 2006 meta-analysis found that the rostral prefrontal cortex was involved in working memory, episodic memory and multiple-task coordination.
This area has also been implicated in decision making prior to the decision being available to conscious awareness

<text>North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (also known as North Carolina A&amp;T State University, North Carolina A&amp;T, N.C. A&amp;T, or simply A&amp;T) is a public, historically black, land-grant research university in Greensboro, North Carolina, United States. It is a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina System. Founded by the North Carolina General Assembly on March 9, 1891, as the Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race, it was the second college established under the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1890, as well as the first for people of color in the State of North Carolina. Initially, the college offered instruction in agriculture, English, horticulture and mathematics. In 1967, the college was designated a Regional University by the North Carolina General Assembly and renamed North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.

With an enrollment of over 14,000 students, North Carolina A&amp;T is the largest historically black college or university (HBCU) in the United States, a position it has held since 2014. The university&#x27;s College of Engineering graduates more black engineers than any other campus in the United States; its College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences produces more African American agriculture graduates than any campus in the country. The university is also a leading producer of African-American kinesiology undergraduates, landscape architects, nurses, teachers, and journalism/mass communication graduates.

The university offers 54 undergraduate, 29 master&#x27;s, and 9 doctoral degree programs through its eight colleges, one school, and one joint school; the university awards more than 2,600 degrees annually and has an alumni base of around 65,000. The main campus encompasses over in area, as well as a working farm, and two research parks totaling a combined . It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;. The university ranks third in sponsored funding among University of North Carolina System institutions. As of 2021, the university conducted over $78 million in academic and scientific research annually and operated 20 research centers and institutes on campus.

The university&#x27;s students, alumni, and sports teams are known as &quot;Aggies&quot;. The university&#x27;s varsity athletic teams are members of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA) in all sports with the exception of women&#x27;s bowling and football.

==History==
===Founding and early years===

North Carolina A&amp;T&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1890 when the United States Congress passed the Second Morrill Act. Aimed mainly at the Confederate states, the Second Morrill Act of 1890 required that each state show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. In order to comply with the Second Morrill Act and yet prevent the admission of African Americans to the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, now known as North Carolina State University, the college&#x27;s board of trustees were empowered to make temporary arrangements for students of color.

On March 9, 1891, the Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race was established by an Act of the North Carolina General Assembly as an annex of the private Shaw University in Raleigh. The Act read in part: &quot;That the leading objective of the college shall be to teach practical agriculture and the mechanic arts and such learning as related thereto, not excluding academic and classical instruction.&quot; The college, which started with four teachers and 37 students, initially offered instruction in agriculture, English, horticulture, and mathematics. The college continued to operate in Raleigh until the Board of Trustees voted, in 1892, to relocate the college to Greensboro. With monetary and land donations totaling $11,000 and , the new Greensboro campus was established the following year and the college&#x27;s first president, John Oliver Crosby, was elected on May 25, 1892.
The college granted admission to both men and women of color from 1893, until the board of trustees voted to restrict admission to males only in 1901. This policy would remain until 1928, when female students were once again allowed to be admitted. In 1899, the college conferred its first degrees to seven graduates.

In 1904, the college developed a farm equipped with the latest in farm machinery and labor-saving devices. The farm provided much of the food for the campus cafeteria. In 1915, the North Carolina General Assembly changed the name of the college to Negro Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina.

===Expansion and growth===

In 1925, Ferdinand D. Bluford was selected as the third president of the college and A&amp;T became a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association (now known as the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association). The next year, the college&#x27;s national alumni association was established. In 1928, the 27-year ban on female students was lifted as the college once again was granted co-educational status. By December 1931, female students were allowed, for the first time, to participate in the student government as members of the student council. In 1939, the college was authorized to grant the Master of Science degree in education and certain other fields. Two years later, the first Master of Science degree was awarded.
The 1940s and 1950s saw the college expand its land holdings. In 1946, the college acquired of land adjacent to the original campus. In 1953, the School of Nursing was established, with the first class graduating four years later. 1955 saw more changes, as Warmoth T. Gibbs was selected as the fourth president of the college. Two years later, the college experienced another name change to the &quot;Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina&quot;. In that same year, the college&#x27;s first white student, Rodney Jaye Miller, of Greensboro, was admitted. In 1959, the college was fully accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS).

===Civil Rights Movement===
On February 1, 1960, four male freshmen helped spark the civil rights movement in the South. Ezell Blair (Jibreel Khazan), Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, and David Richmond &quot;sat in&quot; at an all-white eating establishment (Woolworth&#x27;s) and demanded equal service at the lunch counter. The actions of the four freshmen gained momentum as other students of the college joined them in their non-violent protest to desegregate Woolworth&#x27;s lunch counter, which became known as the Greensboro sit-ins. By the end of July 1960, Blair, McNeil, McCain and Richmond were dubbed the A&amp;T Four.

In 1964, John A. Steinhauer, a science teacher, was the first white student to earn a degree from A&amp;T, earning the Master of Science in Education with a concentration in Chemistry. The following year, the college acquired the land of the former Immanuel Lutheran College, a coeducational junior college located adjacent to the college. In 1967, the college was designated a &quot;regional university&quot; by the North Carolina General Assembly. The college was renamed &quot;North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University&quot;.
In 1969, student protesters from the university, in addition to students of nearby James B. Dudley High School, were involved in a four-day conflict with the Greensboro Police and the National Guard in which there was one casualty. The conflict, referred to as the 1969 Greensboro uprising, lasting May 21 through May 25, was sparked by perceived civil rights issues at the segregated high school, when a popular student council write-in presidential candidate was denied his landslide victory, allegedly because school officials feared his activism in the Black Power Movement. Starting on the campus of Dudley High School, the uprising spread to A&amp;T&#x27;s campus, where students had stood up in support of the Dudley protest. Escalating violence eventually led to an armed confrontation and the subsequent invasion of the campus. Described at the time as &quot;the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university,&quot; the uprising ended soon after the National Guard raided the 505-room male dormitory, W. Kerr Scott Hall, taking hundreds of students into protective custody.

===1970s to present===
In 1971, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation bringing all 16 public institutions that confer bachelor&#x27;s degrees into the University of North Carolina system. As a result of the consolidation, N.C. A&amp;T became a constituent institution and Lewis Carnegie Dowdy, the university&#x27;s sixth president, was reappointed as the university&#x27;s first chancellor in July of the following year. The 1988 academic year saw N.C. A&amp;T set an enrollment record with 6,200 students. The following year, the university bested that record with a total of 6,500 students.

In 2003, N.C. A&amp;T announced the creation of a Joint Millennial Campus, with neighboring UNC Greensboro, with the intent to focus on regional economic development. The following year, the university was classified as a doctoral/research intensive university by the Carnegie Foundation, in addition to forming a partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Natural Resources Conservation Service. On May 1, 2006, Lloyd V. Hackley was named interim chancellor of the university. Hackley served in the position until his successor, Stanley F. Battle, was installed as the 11th chancellor on April 25, 2008. Under the Battle administration, the university was awarded an $18 million grant from the National Science Foundation for an Engineering Research Center, the first time an HBCU was the lead institution for such a center.

On May 22, 2009, Harold L. Martin, Sr., was elected as the twelfth chancellor of the university. The following year, N.C. A&amp;T received approval to establish a Ph.D. program in Computational Science and Engineering beginning in the fall of 2010. That same year, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) opened with 17 students in the doctoral program in nanoscience and one student in the professional master&#x27;s program in nanoscience. According to the National Nanotechnology Initiative, the JSNN became one of fewer than 10 schools nationally to offer degree programs in nanotechnology, and is the only program created and operated collaboratively by two universities. In 2011, North Carolina A&amp;T received approval from the University of North Carolina Board of Governors for its Master of Science in Nanoengineering program, offered through the JSNN. In addition to the M.S. degree the university was approved to offer a doctoral program in Nanoengineering.

In 2011, Martin began implementation of &quot;A&amp;T Preeminence 2020,&quot; a groundbreaking strategic plan that set ambitious goals for the university in enrollment, research funding, diversity, academic quality and more. As the plan took root, N.C. A&amp;T began a remarkable evolution that saw it become the nation&#x27;s largest HBCU in 2014, a position it has held ever since. In 2018, it became America&#x27;s top-ranked public HBCU by U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine, and in 2019, it moved into the numerical rankings of national research universities for the first time in A&amp;T&#x27;s history. Martin oversaw creation of a new strategic plan in 2018, &quot;A&amp;T Preeminence: Taking the Momentum to 2023.&quot; This plan established a new set of growth goals relative to A&amp;T&#x27;s mission as a doctoral research university, including expansion of A&amp;T&#x27;s research programs and increasing the size of the student body to 14,000.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $45 million to North Carolina A&amp;T. Her donation was the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history and one of the largest ever to an HBCU.

==Campus==
North Carolina A&amp;T&#x27;s main campus, often referred to as &quot;Aggieland&quot;, is located approximately nine blocks east of downtown Greensboro, North Carolina, a city that supports a population of approximately 284,816 and is one of three principal cities that forms the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point Combined Statistical Area (CSA), also referred to as the Piedmont Triad region.

Development of the campus started in 1893 with of donated land. Today, the main campus encompasses over in area, and 123 total buildings, which include 28 academic buildings, 15 student residences, and various support buildings and athletic facilities. In addition, the physical plant also includes the working farm, and two research parks totaling a combined . The main roads that create the campus boundaries are East Bessemer street, to the north; East Market street, to the south; North O&#x27;Henry Boulevard (U.S. Route 220/U.S. 29/U.S. 70), to the east; North Dudley street, to the west; and East Lindsay street to the northeast. The main entry point of the campus is located at the intersection of East Market street and North Benbow road.

A portion of today&#x27;s main campus comprises the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina Historic District, which was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. This area along the university&#x27;s western boundary, consists of five Colonial Revival and Classical Revival style buildings that are the university&#x27;s oldest standing structures.

With the growth of the university&#x27;s student body, N.C. A&amp;T has expanded its facilities, most notably through the construction of the Student Center, a 150,000-square-foot complex that houses student organizations, dining facilities, gaming areas, a ballroom and more. Construction began in 2018 on the $90-million Harold L. Martin Sr. Engineering Research and Innovation Complex, which will expand the teaching and research capacity of the university&#x27;s nationally prominent College of Engineering.

===University Galleries===

Located inside the James B. Dudley Memorial Building, the University Galleries are home to the Mattye Reed African Heritage and the H. Clinton Taylor Collections. Founded in the late 1960s, the Reed African Heritage Collection is dedicated to the ancestral and contemporary arts of Africa and the Caribbean. The Reed Collection houses around 3,500 artifacts, art, and craft items from more than 35 African and Caribbean nations. The collection is named for Mattye Reed, the site&#x27;s first curator and director. Reed helped collect a great number of the pieces through soliciting donations from friends and former colleagues on behalf of the university. The Taylor Collection, named for the founder of the university&#x27;s art department, presents rotating exhibits by both established and upstart African-American Artists, in addition to work created by the university&#x27;s students and faculty.

===Sustainability===
The University of North Carolina spends roughly $227 million a year on energy. In 2009, the UNC Board of Governors adopted environmental policies reflective of the UNC System&#x27;s commitment to lead the State of North Carolina to a more sustainable future.

Since 2003, North Carolina A&amp;T has reduced its energy use by 21 percent. According to research conducted by the university, the energy efficiency measures in place inside the 123 buildings on the campus have saved enough energy to meet the power needs of 760 households for a year. In the 2011–12 fiscal year alone, a 32.5 billion BTU reduction in energy helped the university avoid $386,274 in costs. Under the university&#x27;s Strategic Energy Plan, N.C. A&amp;T has implemented energy efficiency measures such as: comprehensive energy audits to identify improvement needs; development of a retro-commissioning process for existing buildings; energy-efficient lighting retrofits throughout the campus; and the development of green network strategies.

In the area of green building, the university is in the process of developing a green building policy that will require the use of sustainable and green building practices wherever feasible and practical on future construction. , there are four green building initiatives being conducted by the university. The Proctor School of Education Building utilizes green roof technology in addition to other sustainable components aimed at reducing storm water runoff and energy demands for air conditioning in the summer months. The Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering (JSNN) Building located at the off-campus Joint Millennial Campus site, was certified as a LEED Gold level building in 2013. In addition to the School of Education and Nanotechnology buildings, the university is planning an environmentally-friendly student center and opened its new student health center in 2015. The two-story, 27,548-square-foot building is LEED silver level certified, and is the university&#x27;s first completely green facility.

Through these efforts towards sustainability and environment friendly university management, N.C. A&amp;T was ranked 10th, out of 301 institutions from 61 countries, in the 2013 The Universitas Indonesia (UI) GreenMetric World University Sustainability Ranking. Additionally, the university ranked 5th among 164 institutions in the category of Campus Setting (Urban) and 9th among 224 institutions in the Comprehensive Higher Education category.

&quot;The A&amp;T Register&quot; and &quot;The Voice&quot; WNAA 90.1 FM are the official media outlets of the university. Students at the university contribute to both &quot;The Register&quot; and the campus radio station. &quot;The A&amp;T Register&quot; was first published in 1894. Currently, the student newspaper is published digitally with two print editions during each fall and spring semesters. In 2013, The Register was awarded first place in Newswriting and second place in Opinion Writing by the North Carolina College Media Association. The Register also earned awards from the 2014 National HBCU Student News Media Conference. The paper was awarded second place in the &quot;Best News Coverage&quot; and &quot;Best Student Newspaper [Non-Regular Production]&quot; categories, and third in the &quot;Best Design - Tabloid or Broadsheet&quot; category.

Started in 1966 as WANT 620 AM, the campus radio station started with the donation of a refurbished radio console from local radio station WEAL. Because the FCC mandated that college radio stations could not compete with commercial radio, WANT was transmitted out of Price Hall on closed-circuit AM band to strategic buildings on campus via cable. The first day&#x27;s broadcast carried, in part, remarks from the campus board of trustees and then president Lewis C. Dowdy. WANT continued operation until 1979, when the campus station switched to an FM band format, and became WNAA 90.1 FM. In 1982 the station transitioned from the conventional 18-hour college radio format to a full 24-hour broadcast format, and in 1984 installed a new tower to increase wattage from 10 to its current 10,000 watts of power, being able to broadcast as far as . Today, WNAA is broadcast both over the air and on-line, serving the Greensboro, High Point, and Winston-Salem metropolitan radio market.

Through the Journalism and Mass Communication department, students manage &quot;The JOMC Journal,&quot; a student-generated multimedia news platform, as well as a high definition television studio and The Aggie Media Group, a public relations agency that provides services including: media relations, quantitative and qualitative research, social media, community, publicity campaigns, and event planning.

Homecoming, which usually occurs in the month of October, coincides with a home football game, and festivities such as tailgating, class and departmental events, nightlife and social functions, musical and comedy concerts, pep rallies, student showcases, fraternity and sorority step shows, a parade, and the coronation of Mister and Miss North Carolina A&amp;T, the university&#x27;s Homecoming King and Queen. Dubbed the &quot;Greatest Homecoming on Earth&quot; (GHOE) by students and alumni, the week-long celebration brings in an influx of over 40,000 alumni and visitors to the city. In a 2011 study conducted by the Greensboro Convention and Visitors Bureau, the economic impact from Homecoming was measured at $11.3 million. Based on crowd measures conducted by law enforcement, over 130,000 current students, alumni, family, and friends were in attendance at the 2024 Homecoming events.

Commencement exercises date back to the university&#x27;s first graduating class in 1899. In 2018, the university awarded 2,149 total bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctorate degrees. Two commencement programs are scheduled each year for the university. Students who complete degree requirements during the summer sessions and the fall semester are invited to participate in the December commencement exercise, while students who complete degree requirements in the spring are invited to participate in the May commencement services. Notable speakers include Mary Elizabeth Carnegie, distinguished educator and champion for the preservation of the history of African-American nurses; Frank Porter Graham, former president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and senator; Donna Brazile, political analyst and Vice Chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee; and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama.

==Athletics==
North Carolina A&amp;T fields a total of 17 varsity sports; eight for men and nine for women. The varsity teams participate in the NCAA Division I and are members of the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA) in all sports with the exception of women&#x27;s bowling and football. The school&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Aggies and are represented by a bulldog mascot. The term &quot;Aggie&quot; has long been used to refer to students who attend agricultural schools, hence the reason the university adopted the nickname at the time of its founding.

, the Aggies have earned more than 60 MEAC and CIAA regular-season and tournament titles. The men&#x27;s basketball team has earned 16 total conference regular-season and tournament championships, including an eight consecutive titles in the 1980s. In 2013, the Aggies made history when the team won their first Division I post-season game defeating the Liberty Flames in the first round of the 2013 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The women&#x27;s basketball program has had success in their own right. The Lady Aggies have claimed six MEAC regular season and two MEAC tournament championships. Their most notable accomplishments include advancing to the regional semifinals in the 2010 Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournament, making them the first Division I HBCU program to win two games in a Division I post-season tournament.

Besides basketball, N.C. A&amp;T has been nationally successful in both football and track and field. The Aggie football team has claimed eight MEAC and five CIAA conference championships. The Aggies have also won four Black college football national championships. The Aggie men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s track and field program has produced 65 individual MEAC champions, and five All-Americans; four MEAC Outdoor championships, one MEAC Indoor championship, and in 2005, placed fifth in the 4 × 100 meters relay in the NCAA Division I national championship.

A&amp;T enjoys a number of rivalries with a number of schools, however, the Aggies&#x27; principal rival is North Carolina Central University. The two schools share this rivalry across all sports, which dates back to 1924 when the two schools first met in football.

<text>Brodmann area 44, or BA44, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. Situated just anterior to premotor cortex (BA6) and on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9.

This area is also known as pars opercularis (of the inferior frontal gyrus), and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Thus, it is bounded caudally by the inferior precentral sulcus (H) and rostrally by the anterior ascending limb of lateral sulcus (H). It surrounds the diagonal sulcus (H). In the depth of the lateral sulcus it borders on the insula. Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally and dorsally by the agranular frontal area 6, dorsally by the granular frontal area 9 and rostrally by the triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 45 BA 45).

==Functions==
Together with left-hemisphere BA45, the left hemisphere BA44 comprises Broca&#x27;s area, a region involved in semantic tasks. Some data suggest that BA44 is more involved in the motor aspect of speech. Some recent findings also suggest the implication of this region in music perception.
Recent neuroimaging studies show BA44 involvement in selective response suppression in go/no-go tasks and is therefore believed to play an important role in the suppression of response tendencies. This may apply mainly to the right BA44. Neuroimaging studies also demonstrate that area 44 is related to hand movements.

The presence of mirror neurons in Broca&#x27;s area suggests language evolved from a gesture imitating system. Broca&#x27;s area is also involved with theory of mind (ToM), which is the ability to understand the mental state of others through observation, inferring, and projecting.

==Trivia==
Scott Flansburg of San Diego, California is a &quot;human calculator&quot; who can perform complex arithmetic in his head. Profiled on the TV show Stan Lee&#x27;s Superhumans, his brain was scanned using fMRI while doing complex calculations, which showed brain activity in this region was absent. Instead there was activity somewhat higher than that of area 44 and closer to the motor cortex.

<text>Brodmann area 45 (BA45), is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It is situated on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9 and adjacent to BA46.

This area in humans occupies the triangular part of inferior frontal gyrus (H) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of the lateral sulcus (H), a portion of the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus (H). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of the lateral sulcus (H), it borders on the insula in the depth of the lateral sulcus.

In terms of cytoarchitecture, it is bounded caudally by the opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 44 (BA44)), rostrodorsally by the middle frontal area 46 (BA46), and ventrally by the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 47 BA47).

==Functions==
The left-hemisphere Brodmann area 44 and Brodmann area 45 make up Broca&#x27;s area, a region that is active in semantic tasks, such as semantic decision tasks (determining whether a word represents an abstract or a concrete entity) and generation tasks (generating a verb associated with a noun).

The precise role of BA45 in semantic tasks remains controversial. For some researchers, its role would be to subserve semantic retrieval or semantic working memory processes. Under this view, BA44 and BA45 would together guide recovery of semantic information and evaluate the recovered information with regard to the criterion appropriate to a given context. A slightly modified account of this view is that activation of BA45 is needed only under controlled semantic retrieval, when strong stimulus-stimulus associations are absent. For other researchers, BA45&#x27;s role is not restricted to semantics per se, but to all activities that require task-relevant representations from among competing representations. 
Lesions of the BA45 lead to the characteristic findings of expressive aphasia in individuals who are left hemispheric dominant.

==Research findings==
=== Asymmetry and language dominance ===

A strong correlation has been found between speech-language and the anatomically asymmetric pars triangularis. Foundas, et al. showed that language function can be localized to one region of the brain, as Paul Broca had done before them, but they also supported the idea that one side of the brain is more involved with language than the other. The human brain has two hemispheres, and each one looks similar to the other; that is, it looks like one hemisphere is a mirror image of the other. However, Foundas, et al. found that the pars triangularis in Broca&#x27;s area is actually larger than the same region in the right side of the brain. This &quot;leftward asymmetry&quot; corresponded both in form and function, which means that the part of the brain that is active during language processing is larger. In almost all the test subjects, this was the left side. In fact, the only subject tested that had right-hemispheric language dominance was found to have a rightward asymmetry of the pars triangularis.

Certain other researchers, however, have found no volumetric asymmetries in the pars triangularis. They have challenged previous findings that pars triangularis asymmetry exists and have suggested that inconsistencies in previous findings may be due to great variability in inter-individual pars triangularis morphology. That is, these regions tend to vary in size and shape much more than other areas of the brain, such as deep cortical nuclei. Furthermore, while these researcher found statistically significant asymmetries in the pars opercularis and the planum temporale, they found no correlations between asymmetries of these brain regions with that of the pars triangularis.

=== Connections in inferior frontal gyrus ===

At least one study demonstrated a high degree of connectivity between the three subregions of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). By stimulating one region of the IFG and measuring the response in distinct regions, these researchers were able to demonstrate the existence of numerous pathways between the pars triangularis and pars opercularis. Also, stimulation of one region of the pars triangularis elicited a response in distinct regions of the pars triangularis, illustrating the presence of networks within the subgyral region.
Additionally, The pars triangularis was implicated in semantic processing of language. By measuring the response of the brain by electroencephalography as it responded to different sentence types (those with or without semantic errors), Maess et al. demonstrated a time-lag in the comprehension of erroneous sentences. To understand this one would only need to imagine a person being told something they did not understand. They would pause and take a moment to process the information. Furthermore, these researchers demonstrated a characteristic processing pattern called an &quot;N400&quot;, which refers to a negativity that appears in the pars triangularis about 400 ms after the syntactic mismatch is presented. However, the pars triangularis is likely to be only part of the network generating the N400 response in EEG since the magnetic counterpart N400m measured using MEG has been consistently localized to the superior temporal cortex.

=== Prefrontal cortex and the cognitive control of memory ===

Pars triangularis has been shown to have a role in cognitive control of memory. There are more ways than one to remember something. When a person remembers, (s)he retrieves information from storage in a memory center of the brain. This information may be the muscle contraction sequence for shoe-tying, the face of a loved one, or anything in between. When someone remembers something automatically, without concentrating on it and without trying, it is called &quot;bottom-up&quot; processing. But sometimes, people really have to struggle to remember something. A student taking a test and trying to remember the answer to a question is concentrating their attention on retrieving the memory. The student is exhibiting cognitive control over their memory. This type of processing is directed, in part, by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). Pars triangularis is found in this region.

When reading aloud, people must decode written language to decipher its pronunciation. This processing takes place in Broca&#x27;s area. The reader might use previous knowledge of a word in order to correctly vocalize it, or the reader might use knowledge of systematic letter combinations, which represent corresponding phonemes. Scientists can learn about what the brain is doing while people process language by looking at what it does with errors in language. As above, scientists can investigate the extra processing that occurs when people are challenged with a problem. In this case, scientists took advantage of the way pseudo-words and exception words by examining the brain as it interprets these problematic words.
When people process language, they use different parts of Broca&#x27;s area for different things. Pars triangularis is involved in a specific type of language processing. Specifically, pars triangularis becomes activated when people read exception words, which are words with atypical spelling-to-sound relationships. For example, &quot;have&quot; is an exception word because it is pronounced with a short &quot;a&quot;, which is contrary to grammatical rules of pronunciation. The &quot;e&quot; at the end of the word should lead to the pronunciation of the long &quot;a&quot; sound, as in &quot;cave&quot; or &quot;rave&quot;. Because we are so familiar with the word &quot;have&quot;, we are able to remember its pronunciation, and we don&#x27;t have to think through the rules each time we read it. Pars triangularis helps us do that.

When trying to retrieve information in a top-down fashion, some kind of control mechanism is necessary. Recalling that top-down retrieval depends on conscious control, it is easy to see that there must be some way to exclude irrelevant data from the retrieval. In order to home in on the desired information, some selection must occur. This selection is thought to occur post-retrieval in the mid-VLPFC, which corresponds generally to the location of pars triangularis. The theory here is that information is retrieved by certain regions of the left VLPFC, and then it is selected for relevance in another region. This is called the &quot;two part&quot; model of memory retrieval.

Almost every person in the world has learned at least one language. Also, almost everyone that has learned a language has learned it at a young age. Some people are multilingual. Some of these multilingual have learned second or third languages in concert with their first, at a young age, and some have learned other languages in their adulthood. Studies on different subsets of monolinguals and multilinguals have revealed some interesting findings.

By looking at the similarities between the first and second language and what they do to the brain, these researchers found that brain activation looked very different depending on which language the test subjects were processing. They found that pars triangularis activation changes during processing of these different languages, which is understandable considering the known role of pars triangularis in language.

There is a difference between the processing patterns of primary and secondary languages in processing of passive sentences. These are sentences using some form of the verb &quot;be&quot; with a verb in the past participle form. For example, &quot;He is ruined&quot; is a passive sentence because the verb &quot;ruin&quot; is in the past participle form and used with &quot;is&quot;, which is a form of the verb &quot;be&quot;. This study shows that processing this sentence, late bilinguals used their pars triangularis much more than their counterparts. This result implies certain things about the way language is learned. For example, It has been suggested that the reason people often have such difficulty learning foreign languages during adulthood is that their brains are trying to code language information in a region of the brain that is not dedicated to understanding language. According to this view, this is the reason native speakers are able to speak so quickly while their late-bilingual counterparts are forced to stutter as they struggle to process grammatical rules.

=== Cortical dynamics of word recognition ===

There is a theory that pars triangularis is especially involved in semantic processing of language, as opposed to phonological processing. That is, pars triangularis is thought to be more involved in deciphering the meaning of words rather than trying to decide what the word is based on the sound that goes into the ear. This study got data that supported this theory. Furthermore, these researchers saw evidence for parallel semantic processing, which occurs when the brain multitasks. When their subjects were undergoing experimentation, they were presented with consonant strings, pseudo-words, and words, and the delay between stimulus and brain activity was about the same for phonological and semantic processing, even though the two seemed to occur in slightly different regions.

In the study &quot;Semantic Encoding and Retrieval in the Left Inferior Prefrontal Cortex: A Functional magnetic resonance imaging Study of Task Difficulty and Process Specificity&quot;, researchers found that pars triangularis (as well as some of its neighbors) increased its activity during semantic encoding, regardless of difficulty of the word being processed. This is consistent with the theory that pars triangularis is involved in semantic processing more than phonological processing. Furthermore, they found that these semantic encoding decisions resulted in less involvement of pars triangularis with repetition of the used words. It may seem intuitive that practice would make the brain better at recognizing the words as they reappeared, but there is something else to be learned from this result, as well. That pars triangularis activity went down with repetition also signifies the movement of the task of recognizing the word from the conscious to the passive. This is called repetition priming, and it occurs independent of intention. This idea, when paired with theories about pt&#x27;s involvement in conscious retrieval of memory, serves to illustrate the complexity of the brain and its functions. These results together imply the possibility that similar mechanics are required for encoding and retrieving information. Another point of interest was that decreased pars triangularis activation with repetition did not occur with redundant presentation of nonsemantically processed words.

=== On Broca, brain, and binding: a new framework ===

A person is highly interconnected with other regions of the brain, especially those in the left frontal language network. Though its function seems to be distinct from its neighbors, this high degree of connectivity supports the idea that language can be integrated into many of the seemingly unrelated thought processes we have. This is not a difficult idea to imagine. For instance, attempting to remember the name of a brand new acquaintance can be challenging, and it often demands the attention of the person doing the remembering. In this example, a person is trying to comprehend sound as a part of language, place the word they just heard in the category &quot;names&quot;, while associating it also as a tag for the face they just saw, simultaneously committing all of these pieces of data to memory. In this view, it hardly seems far-fetched that the roles of pars triangularis in language processing, semantic comprehension, and conscious control of memory are unrelated. In fact, it would be unlikely for pars triangularis not to have multiple roles in the brain, especially considering its high degree of connectivity, both within the left frontal language center, and to other regions.

=== Schizophrenia and Broca area ===

Schizophrenia is a poorly understood disease with complicated symptoms. In an effort to find a cause for this problem, these researchers looked at the brains of schizophrenic patients. It had been shown previously that abnormal gyrification, asymmetry, complexity, and variability occur in patients with schizophrenia. These investigators presented data showing that pt, specifically was highly distorted in schizophrenic patients compared with demographically matched normal subjects. They asserted that Broca&#x27;s area is an especially plastic region of the brain in that its morphology can change dramatically from childhood to adulthood. This makes sense when considering the special ability of children to easily learn language, but it also means that the involvement of Broca&#x27;s area is limited with respect to memory and recall; children do not seem to be unable to consciously search their memories. Furthermore, investigators took volumetric measurements of the grey and white matter of the brains of their test subjects and compared those measurements to their normal control subjects. They found that schizophrenic patients had dramatically reduced white matter.

As the brain develops, connectivity of different regions changes dramatically. Researchers found that there is a discrepancy in the way white matter and grey matter develop in schizophrenic patients. People with schizophrenia tend to have an absence of white matter expansion.

=== Heuristic and analytic reasoning ===

Transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left BA45 facilitated incongruent reasoning performance and impaired congruent reasoning performance, suggesting that the left BA45 is a component of a belief-based heuristic system. The right BA45 involvement in blocking the heuristic system is inferred from the blocking of the left homologue and resulting facilitation of logical-analytic reasoning performance.

<text>Brodmann area 46, or BA46, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It is between BA10 and BA45.

BA46 is known as middle frontal area 46. In the human brain it occupies approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex.

Cytoarchitecturally, BA46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909). There is some discrepancy between the extent of BA8 (Brodmann-1905) and the same area as described by Walker (1940).

==Function==
The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a central role in sustaining attention and managing working memory, and has recently been shown to regulate self-control. It is one of the few cortical areas whose activity diminishes during REM sleep.

The high connectivity of this area within the frontal lobe as well as other parts of the brain means that damage can have a wide variety of effects. Lesions impair short-term memory, cause difficulty inhibiting responses, impair the ability to judge the relevance of stimuli, and cause problems in organization.

Recent research has shed light on the mechanism of working memory and the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) observe changes in cortical activity due to either depolarization or hyperpolarization of underlying areas. The effect of these voltage shifts on activity in other structures is then measured. The goal of the studies is to identify the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in memory circuit modulation and learning.

In a limited research study, participants tested their baseline working memory with digit span exercises, then underwent tDCS for ten minutes before being retested with the exercises. Contrary to expectations, tDCS showed only minimal effects on working memory.

Due to the lack of coherent resources and data of the experiment, more WM experiments using tDCS need to be evaluated. Some applications being discussed involve using tDCS adjunctively with cognitive remediation to enhance WM in neurologic and psychiatric conditions.

A recent study found that targeting transcranial magnetic stimulation to Brodmann area 46 has better clinical efficacy treating depression, as its functionally is connected (negatively correlated) to Brodmann area 25.

<text>Winston-Salem State University (WSSU) is a historically black public university in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It is part of the University of North Carolina system.

==History==
Winston-Salem State University was founded as Slater Industrial Academy on September 28, 1892. It began with 25 pupils and one teacher in a one-room frame structure. By 1895 the school was recognized by the State of North Carolina and in 1899 it was chartered by the state as Slater Industrial and Slater Normal School.

In 1925, the North Carolina General Assembly renamed the school Winston-Salem Teachers College and the North Carolina State Board of Education allowed the college to award elementary teacher education degrees, making it the first black institution to provide this specialized training.

The School of Nursing was established in 1953 offering baccalaureate degrees. In 1963 the North Carolina General Assembly authorized changing the name from Winston-Salem Teachers College to Winston-Salem State College. A statute designating Winston-Salem State College as Winston-Salem State University received legislative approval in 1969. On July 1, 1972, Winston-Salem State University became one of 16 constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina.

In 2020, MacKenzie Scott donated $30 million to Winston-Salem State. Her donation is the largest single gift in the university&#x27;s history.

==Academics==
Winston-Salem State offers over 40 academic majors and 10 graduate degrees. The school enrolls approximately 5,200 students and employs 400 faculty and over 550 staff members.

===Colleges &amp; Departments===
*College of Arts, Sciences, Businesses, and Education
*School of Health Sciences
*Graduate and Professional Programs
*University College and Lifelong Learning

===Rankings===
Winston-Salem State University was ranked the #7 top college in the United States by the Social Mobility Index college rankings.

Winston-Salem State has been ranked #27 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in the Top Public Comprehensive Baccalaureate Colleges of the South category between 2001 and 2009. By 2016, the university had fallen to a ranking of #84 in the same category.

== Library ==
C. G. O’Kelly Library is the main academic library on the campus of Winston-Salem State University, which was originally the Slater Industrial Academy. The original library was housed in Blair Hall until 1967 when the new library was built and O’Kelly Library has gone through two additions and one renovation within the past forty years.

==Campus==
The campus has more than 40 buildings covering . WSSU&#x27;s Diggs Gallery was recognized as one of the top African-American galleries in its region.

==Student activities==

===Athletics===

Winston-Salem State University is currently a member of the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association (CIAA) in NCAA Division II. From the 2007–08 season through the 2009–10 season, the Rams competed in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), despite being a transitional member that was attempting to attain full membership within the MEAC or within NCAA Division I, in which the Rams were also scheduled to begin full membership and gain access to NCAA tournaments in 2011. However, it never occurred due to financial difficulties.

=== Esports Integration ===
Winston-Salem State University integrated esports into its computer science program with a $400,000 grant from the National Science Foundation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program. The initiative includes an esports lab, offering hands-on learning and attracting underrepresented minority students to STEM fields while expanding career paths in the esports industry.

<text>The 1891 Canadian federal election was held on March 5, 1891, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 7th Parliament of Canada. It was won by the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. 

The main issue of the 1891 campaign was Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy, a policy of protective tariffs. The Liberals supported reciprocity (free trade) with the United States. Canadian voters would return to the issue of free trade 20 years later in the 1911 federal election.

Macdonald led a Conservative campaign emphasizing stability, and retained the Conservatives&#x27; majority in the House of Commons. It was a close election and he campaigned hard. Macdonald died a few months after the election, which led to his succession by four different Conservative Prime Ministers until the 1896 election.

It was Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s first election as leader of the Liberals. Although he lost the election, he increased the Liberals&#x27; support. He returned in 1896 to win a solid majority, despite losing the popular vote.

The Nationalist Party won a seat in Quebec. Dorchester riding elected Cyrille-Émile Vaillancourt.

<doc id="524241" wikidata="Q4973093" url="?curid=524241" title="Brodmann area 47">
<text>Brodmann area 47, or BA47, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It curves from the lateral surface of the frontal lobe into the ventral (orbital) frontal cortex. It is inferior to BA10 and BA45, and lateral to BA11. This cytoarchitectonic region most closely corresponds to the gyral region the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus, although these regions are not equivalent. Pars orbitalis is not based on cytoarchitectonic distinctions, and rather is defined according to gross anatomical landmarks. Despite a clear distinction, these two terms are often used liberally in peer-reviewed research journals.

BA47 is also known as orbital area 47. In the human, on the orbital surface it surrounds the caudal portion of the orbital sulcus (H) from which it extends laterally into the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally by the triangular area 45, medially by the prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909, and rostrally by the frontopolar area 10 (Brodmann-1909).

It incorporates the region that Brodmann identified as &quot;Area 12&quot; in the monkey, and therefore, following the suggestion of Michael Petrides, some contemporary neuroscientists refer to the region as &quot;BA47/12&quot;.

BA47 has been implicated in the processing of syntax in oral and sign languages, musical syntax, and semantic aspects of language.

== Functions and Clinical Considerations ==

=== Language Processing and Comprehension ===
A major function of BA47 is language processing and comprehension. Although Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas are often the major foci of neuroanatomical studies related to language, research has discovered that these two areas are not as integral to language comprehension as originally thought; other structures like BA47 play a major role. Specifically, BA47 is active in tasks regarding semantics, or identifying the meaning of words and sentences. To understand language semantics, consider Dapretto and Bookheimer’s (1999) study where participants needed to identify that there was a difference between the sentences, “The man was attacked by the Doberman,” and “The man was attacked by the Pitbull.” While sentence form was similar, the words Doberman and Pitbull had different meanings, specifically dog breeds. This is indicative of a change in semantics. Having defined what semantics are, it is important to identify the functional limitations of individuals with damage to BA47. Patients with lesions to BA47 reported difficulty engaging in tasks that required one to process words as well as tasks that required one to be familiar with grammatical rules.

Studies have determined that BA47 is involved in processing more than just spoken language. Considering BA47’s role in language semantics, this function is not related only to oral communication; BA47 is also important for identifying semantics in sign language. Specifically, BA47 plays a role in helping us determine what spoken words mean as well as what signed words mean. This finding that similar areas of the brain are active when processing different types of linguistic information is especially interesting considering the fact that the sensory modalities involved in spoken and sign language are different, the former involves audition and the latter involves vision. Furthermore, in addition to language processing, BA47 helps us process music. Levitin and Menon (2003) found that BA47 showed greater activation when individuals were presented with “scrambled” sounds that violated their expectations versus sounds that went together and confirmed their expectations. That is, with disrupted musical structure, participants required more brain processing for musical comprehension, and that happened in BA47.

=== Emotional Recognition ===
BA47 is thought to be related to the recognition of emotions. The emotions thought to be recognized by BA47 are fear, disgust, and anger. This hypothesis was tested be using an fMRI experiment on six healthy individuals. They were shown eight faces showing the emotions of fear, disgust, anger, or neutral. The fMRI image was taken after the subjects were shown the face for 3 seconds. BA47 showed increased activity when the subject was shown the emotions of fear, disgust, and anger.

<text>The University of North Carolina School of the Arts (UNCSA) is a public art school in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. It grants a high school diploma, in addition to both undergraduate and graduate degrees. Founded in 1963 as the North Carolina School of the Arts by then-Governor Terry Sanford, it was the first public arts conservatory in the United States. The school owns and operates the Stevens Center in Downtown Winston-Salem and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

The school consists of five professional schools: School of Dance, School of Design &amp; Production (including a High School Visual Arts Program), School of Drama, School of Filmmaking, and School of Music.

==History==
The idea of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts was initiated in 1962 by Vittorio Giannini, a leading American Composer and teacher of Composition at Juilliard, the Curtis Institute of Music, and the Manhattan School of Music, who approached then-governor Terry Sanford and enlisted the help of author John Ehle and William Sprott Greene, Jr. and Martha Dulin Muilenburg of Charlotte, North Carolina, to support his dream of an arts conservatory. State funds were appropriated, and a North Carolina Conservatory Committee was established. The School of the Arts became a constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system in 1972.

Vittorio Giannini was the school&#x27;s founder and first president. His vision of arts education shaped UNCSA at its beginning and continues to influence it today. Giannini served as president of the fledgling institution until his death in November 1966. A resolution dated December 3, 1966, by the board of trustees and the governor pays tribute to Giannini as the founder of the school, noting that &quot;When it was a dream, he sought a home for it and helped bring it into being. When it was an infant institution, he gave it structure and design.&quot; The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Robert Ward became UNCSA&#x27;s second president following Giannini&#x27;s death.

In 1974 Robert Suderburg became UNCSA&#x27;s third chancellor following Martin Sokoloff, the administrative director, who served as interim chancellor from 1973 to 1974. During his time at UNCSA the Workplace building, containing the Semans Library, was opened on the UNCSA campus, as well as the Stevens Center, previously the Carolina Theatre, in downtown Winston-Salem. The gala opening of the Stevens Center featured the school&#x27;s symphony orchestra conducted by Leonard Bernstein, with Isaac Stern as soloist and Gregory Peck as the Master of Ceremonies. Attendees included Agnes de Mille, Cliff Robertson, Governor James Hunt, President and Mrs. Gerald Ford and Lady Bird Johnson. The Stevens Center remains UNCSA&#x27;s largest performance facility.

Jane E. Milley became Chancellor at the School of the Arts in September 1984. In the spring of 1990, Alex C. Ewing was appointed chancellor. He assumed the position in July 1990, following Philip R. Nelson, former Dean of music at Yale University, who served as interim chancellor during the 1989–90 school year. Ewing had been associated with the school since 1985, when he became chairman of the board of visitors. In 1988 he established the Lucia Chase Endowed Fellowship for Dance at the school, in memory of his mother, a co-founder and principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre. Ewing oversaw the revitalization of the Joffrey Ballet during his tenure as general director in the 1960s. As chancellor, Ewing oversaw the school&#x27;s $25 million campaign for endowment and scholarships. He also orchestrated a combination of local, state, and national support to secure the establishment of NCSA&#x27;s fifth arts school, the School of Filmmaking, in 1993. Ewing took a special interest in NCSA&#x27;s campus plan. Other capital projects he spearheaded included a new sculpture studio, a new fitness center, and the start of the student commons renovation. Wade Hobgood, Dean of the College of the Arts at California State University at Long Beach since 1993, was named chancellor in February 2000, assuming the position on July 1, 2000.

A 2004 state audit uncovered multiple instances of financial improprieties.

John Mauceri was UNCSA&#x27;s seventh chancellor. He assumed the position following Gretchen M. Bataille, former Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs of the 16-campus University of North Carolina, who served as interim chancellor during the 2005–2006 academic year.

In 2008, the institution&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the school from the &quot;North Carolina School of the Arts&quot; to the &quot;University of North Carolina School of the Arts&quot; to raise its profile. The name change was subsequently approved by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors, North Carolina Senate, North Carolina House of Representatives, and Governor Mike Easley.

In 2011, the school settled a lawsuit brought forward by an anonymous former employee after negligently hiring a known sexual predator to its campus police department. According to the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;, the amount paid to the former employee by the school was $100,000.

Chancellor Mauceri announced in the fall of 2012 that he would retire at the conclusion of the 2012–2013 academic year. Lindsay Bierman, former editor of Southern Living magazine, served as chancellor from 2014 to 2019, overseeing the implementation of a new strategic plan, widespread campus renovations, and the launch of the largest fundraising campaign in school history. Bierman departed UNCSA in 2019 to become chief executive officer of the North Carolina public television system, known then as UNC-TV and subsequently rebranded as PBS North Carolina.

In 2020, Brian Cole, who had previously served as dean of the UNCSA School of Music and interim chancellor, was named the ninth chancellor at UNCSA.

The following year, Soderlund and six other dance alumni sued the school and multiple former administrators for sexual abuses perpetrated by faculty. The lawsuit, &quot;Alloways-Ramsey et al. v. Milley et al.&quot;, case 21-CVS-4831 filed 29 September 2021 in the Superior Court for Forsyth County, was made possible by a special North Carolina law allowing child sexual abuse survivors to file claims through the end of the year. An investigation by the &quot;Raleigh News &amp; Observer&quot; and the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; found that the school&#x27;s investigation into alleged faculty misconduct in the 1990s &quot;hid the most damning discoveries.&quot; In a subsequent refiling, 32 additional alumni joined the complaint, alleging various forms of sexual, physical and verbal abuse by faculty. 17 more alumni joined the lawsuit in late December 2021, bringing the total number of plaintiffs to 56. In May 2024, with the final number of claimants having reached 65, UNCSA and the survivors&#x27; attorneys announced a $12.5 million-dollar settlement to be paid out to the survivors incrementally over four years mostly by the State of North Carolina and partially by the university.

Stephen Shipps, who worked as a violin instructor at UNCSA from 1980 to 1989 (and was also a defendant in the high school alumni lawsuit), was sentenced to five years in prison on April 14, 2022, for trafficking an underaged girl for the purpose of having sex with her back in 2002. Four decades&#x27; worth of sexual misconduct allegations against Shipps, made by women who attended both UNCSA and the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre, &amp; Dance, came to light as the result of an investigation by the student newspaper &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; in 2018.

==Campus==
The school&#x27;s campus consists of in Winston-Salem, near Old Salem. There are two residence halls for high school students, Artist Village, a 5 story dormitory on campus, and an off-campus student apartment complex within walking distance. The school has eleven performance and screening spaces; the ACE Exhibition Complex with three movie theaters, Crawford Recital Hall (with a Fisk Organ), deMille Theatre for dance, Hood Recital Hall, Performance Place with three theatrical spaces, the Stevens Center in downtown Winston-Salem, which started refurbishment starting in 2023, and Watson Chamber Music Hall. Performance Place is the home of the drama department, the ACE Theatre is the home of the filmmaking department, deMille theatre is the home of the dance department and Watson, Hood and Crawford halls are used by the music department. The Stevens Center is shared.

The school also has a fitness center with an interior basketball court, the Semans Library, the Hanes Student Commons, Workplace (adjacent to the library) which holds Visual Arts Studios as well as Offices and Studios for the School of Dance, Gray Building, which holds high school academics on the third floor and music offices and practice rooms on the first and second floors, a building holding two dance studios, a visual arts sculpting studio, a large design and production complex, a costume, wig and makeup studio, a welcome center, and several buildings for administrative offices and college academics. New studio spaces and a new apartment complex are currently under construction.

==Performance opportunities==
UNCSA offers many performance opportunities throughout the course of a school year. Dance students have three seasonal performances: Fall dance, Winter dance, and Spring dance. They also perform the Nutcracker every Christmas as well as many other minor performances throughout the school year. Music students have the chance to perform in front of their peers every Wednesday at performance hour, and students are usually in a large ensemble, such as jazz band, orchestra, opera, or wind ensemble. These ensembles each perform several times a year.

The School of Design and Production is responsible for the scenery, costumes, wigs, makeup, lighting, sound, and stage management for all shows produced by the School of Drama, two operas that UNCSA produces each year through the Fletcher Opera Institute, as well as dance performances, although dance costumes are provided partly by the Costume Department and also by the School of Dance&#x27;s own professional costume shop. The Lighting Department each December presents a showcase entitled &quot;Photona&quot; which combines lighting as well as projection equipment.

The Film-making school is host to the ACE Exhibition Complex, where students can display their work and watch others. This complex, along with the Stevens Center, is host to the RiverRun International Film Festival every spring.

===All-school musical===
Once every four years, UNCSA produces an all-school musical – a Broadway-style production involving all five arts schools of the conservatory. All students have the opportunity to audition. Past all-school musicals have included &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate,&quot; &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; with the most recent one being Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot;. The purpose of the all-school musicals is not only to provide the students with professional experience but also to raise money and awareness for the school. For example, for &quot;West Side Story&quot; the lead roles and Chancellor John Mauceri traveled to New York to promote the school and the school&#x27;s revival of the musical. &quot;West Side Story&quot; was performed at UNCSA&#x27;s Stevens Center from May 3–13, 2007, and then went on tour to Chicago&#x27;s Ravinia Festival on June 8, 2007. The production was directed by Dean of Drama Gerald Freedman, the assistant director of the original production, and conducted by UNCSA Chancellor and world renowned conductor John Mauceri. It has also been reported that Arthur Laurents changed portions of the dialogue for the UNCSA production.

In May 2011, UNCSA presented &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; as an all-school musical, once again conducted by Mauceri with direction by UNCSA alumnus Terrence Mann. Notably, the production utilized archival photography, original design notes, Miles White&#x27;s &quot;swatch book&quot;, Robert Russell Bennett&#x27;s original 24-piece orchestrations, and interviews with the surviving members of the original cast (including Celeste Holm and Joan Roberts) to replicate the original 1943 Broadway production as closely as possible, with the participation of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization and Gemze de Lappe, who also recreated Agnes de Mille&#x27;s choreography. The attempt was noted by Ted Chapin, the then-president of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization, as unprecedented in the musical&#x27;s history, with theater historian Ethan Mordden highlighting the production as the first time many elements of the original design had been realized in color for modern theater audiences. The production was professionally recorded for broadcast on UNC-TV, and won a National Educational Telecommunications Award. It was later broadcast on Oklahoma Educational Television Authority in 2012, and has since been released as a two-part video on YouTube.

===Mascot===
Although UNCSA has no officially sanctioned athletic teams, the school mascot is The Fighting Pickle. The premiere athletic event from the early 1970s was an annual touch-football game between a UNCSA team versus one from a Wake Forest University fraternity.

The mascot was selected by a contest name the football team in 1972. The original name was simply &quot;The Pickles&quot;, along with a slogan, &quot;Sling &#x27;Em By The Warts!&quot; but the mascot eventually became &quot;The Fighting Pickles&quot;. In the spring of 2010, UNCSA hosted a competition to choose the new, official &quot;Fighting Pickle&quot; mascot. Design entries and voting was opened to students, alumni, faculty, staff and former faculty and staff. The winner was unveiled on May 21, 2010, in the Student Union&#x27;s cafe, &quot;The Pickle Jar&quot;.

<text>In pathology, pathogenesis is the process by which a disease or disorder develops. It can include factors which contribute not only to the onset of the disease or disorder, but also to its progression and maintenance. The word comes .

== Description ==
Types of pathogenesis include microbial infection, inflammation, malignancy and tissue breakdown. For example, bacterial pathogenesis is the process by which bacteria cause infectious illness.

Most diseases are caused by multiple processes. For example, certain cancers arise from dysfunction of the immune system (skin tumors and lymphoma after a renal transplant, which requires immunosuppression), &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; is spread through contact with respiratory secretions, such as saliva, mucus, or cough droplets from an infected person and colonizes the upper respiratory tract and begins to multiply.

The pathogenic mechanisms of a disease (or condition) are set in motion by the underlying causes, which if controlled would allow the disease to be prevented. Often, a potential cause is identified by epidemiological observations before a pathological link can be drawn between the cause and the disease. The pathological perspective can be directly integrated into an epidemiological approach in the interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology. Molecular pathological epidemiology can help to assess pathogenesis and causality by means of linking a potential risk factor to molecular pathologic signatures of a disease. Thus, the molecular pathological epidemiology paradigm can advance the area of causal inference.

<doc id="524247" wikidata="Q3218363" url="?curid=524247" title="Lasso (programming language)">
<text>Lasso is an application server and server management interface designed to develop internet applications. It is also a general-purpose, high-level programming language. Originally a web datasource connection tool for Filemaker and later included in Apple Computer&#x27;s FileMaker 4.0 and Claris Homepage as CDML, it has since evolved into a complex language used to develop and serve large-scale internet applications and web pages.

Lasso includes a simple template system allowing code to control generation of HTML and other content types. Lasso is an object-oriented programming language in which every value is an object. It also supports procedural programming through &quot;unbound&quot; methods. The language uses traits and multiple dispatch extensively.

Lasso has a dynamic type system, where objects can be loaded and augmented at runtime, automatic memory management, a comprehensive standard library, and three compiling methodologies: dynamic (comparable to PHP-Python), just-in-time compilation (comparable to Java or .NET Framework), and pre-compiled (comparable to C). Lasso also supports Query Expressions, allowing elements within arrays and other types of sequences to be iterated, filtered, and manipulated using a natural language syntax similar to SQL.
Lasso includes full Unicode character support in the standard string object, allowing it to serve and support multi-byte characters such as Japanese and Swedish, and supports transparent UTF-8 conversion when writing string data to the network or file system.

Lasso is often used as a scripting language, and also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts. Lasso code can be packaged into standalone executable programs called &quot;LassoApps&quot;, in which folder structures are compiled into single files.

The Lasso Server application server runs as a system service and receives requests from the web server through FastCGI. It then hands the request off to the appropriate Lasso Instance, which formulates the response. Multiple individual instances are supported, allowing one server to handle multiple sites, each as separate processes. The server uses a high performance IO-based green threading system designed for multi-core systems.

Lasso can be compared to the server-side scripting languages PHP and Python, ColdFusion, Ruby, etc.

==History==
Lasso began in the mid-1990s when early web developers were attempting to build database-backed websites using Apple&#x27;s FileMaker Pro. On the Mac platform, there were two solutions: Eric Bickford&#x27;s WEB-FM, and Russell Owens&#x27; FileMaker CGI (ROFM) - both built in AppleScript and requiring the use of FileMaker Pro calculation fields for formatting. (WEB-FM was subsequently rewritten in C).

In the fall of 1995, independent developer Vince Bonfanti wrote a new CGI based on ROFM, using C/C++ for improved performance, and using the notion of HTML-based &quot;templates&quot; instead of relying on calculation fields. This proved very popular in the FileMaker community, and was brought to the attention of Bill Doerrfeld, owner of Blue World Communications Inc., a print and website development firm based out of Issaquah, Washington, who bought the source code.

At this time, Blue World experimented with improvements for the CGI in the Frontier scripting environment, which inspired the name &quot;Lasso&quot;. Further need for improvement drove the creation of a C-based CGI which was later released as &quot;Lasso 1.0&quot;. At this point Lasso only worked with FileMaker Pro 3.x and WebSTAR, and only ran on Apple Mac OS 8 and above.

Lasso&#x27;s usage grew notably from reviews in print publications and Blue World&#x27;s hosting of and participation in many email discussion lists, many of which specifically pertained to FileMaker Pro. Blue World also made frequent appearances and was known as a leading company at MacWorld conferences.

Following the release of the Lasso 1.2 lineup in January 1997, Blue World and the Bonfantis entered private talks with Claris, the software division of Apple Computer, and owner of FileMaker Pro. Claris eventually licensed the post-version-1.2 Lasso source code, and with the help of Vince and Paul Bonfanti released the FileMaker Web Companion as a component of FileMaker Pro 4.0. FileMaker Web Companion&#x27;s language, CDML (Claris Dynamic Markup Language), differed from Lasso 1.2&#x27;s LDML (Lasso Dynamic Markup Language), but was close enough as to offer an easy transition for developers looking to serve from FileMaker Pro through third-party servers and offered more compelling features.

Including the Lasso-like Web Companion in FileMaker 4.0 also stimulated growth of Lasso within the Macintosh web development community. Blue World continued developing Lasso with Kyle Jessup becoming Lasso&#x27;s lead programmer. Lasso 2.0 was released in July 1997, introducing some fundamental shifts in how Lasso could be used.

On February 26, 2002, Blue World released Lasso 5, a radical departure from the FileMaker-centric language to date. (There was never a Lasso 4 release; the version number skipped from 3 to 5.) Lasso 5 included, among many updates, a completely rewritten architecture (for OS X, Windows, Linux), and an embedded MySQL database. Though Lasso 5 still spoke to a FileMaker database (but not to a FileMaker Server), FileMaker as a data source remained relatively slow compared to an SQL engine, and was prohibitively more expensive. Since v2.0, Lasso was fully multithreaded, allowing many connections at once, but succumbed to FileMaker&#x27;s latency or lag in certain operations, and there was no way to get around it reliably other than to make major changes to the data source.

Lasso 5 also added support for Apache HTTP Server natively under OS X, Windows, and Linux, joining Webstar 5, AppleShare IP (which was replaced by OS X Server), and iTools (from Tenon). (Mac OS 9, on which Lasso had been used for many years, was unsupported). This drove closer ties to a classic LAMP server architecture.

Blue World Communications released a series of plug-ins for popular Web development packages from Macromedia and Adobe. Lasso Studio 1.5 for Dreamweaver was a runner-up in MacWorld magazine&#x27;s Editors&#x27; Choice Awards for Internet and Development in 2001, losing out to Adobe Dreamweaver 3. Lasso Studio for Dreamweaver 1.5 was also reviewed favorably by MacWorld magazine, earning mice. Later version of Lasso Studio supported both Macromedia Dreamweaver and Adobe GoLive including Lasso Studio 7 for Dreamweaver and GoLive on March 26, 2004.

With the release of FileMaker Server and FileMaker Server Advanced version 7 in 2004 FileMaker signaled a major change in their strategy for serving data to Web sites. They emphasized XML-XSLT, ODBC, and JDBC connectivity, but only through the more expensive FileMaker Server Advanced product. Blue World began to distance the Lasso language from FileMaker and Apple. In 2005, Lasso Pro received MySQL Network certification demonstrating the importance of the popular open source database to the future of Lasso.

On August 1 of 2004, Bill Doerrfeld officially sold the Lasso product line to OmniPilot Software, Inc. in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Lasso 7.0.3 was the last version of Lasso released by Blue World.

On October 25, 2004, OmniPilot officially announced the release of Lasso 8, a version including sandboxing for multiple sites on the same server and connectivity to many new datasources. This also included the first &quot;free&quot; version of Lasso limited to IP addresses. OmniPilot followed this release with a number of complementary products, including Lasso Studio 8 for Dreamweaver and GoLive on March 28, 2005, Lasso Studio for Eclipse, ChartFX integration and a number of free Lasso-based solutions.

In 2007, three OmniPilot employees, Kyle Jessup (the original developer of Lasso 1.0), Fletcher Sandbeck (an early employee of Blue World known for regular Tips and Tricks) and Kerry Adams (an employee of OmniPilot) created a new company, LassoSoft LLC, to purchase the intellectual property of Lasso from OmniPilot and continue development. Recognizing the need to be competitive against much more popular languages such as PHP and ASP, radical changes in architecture, syntax and structure were made and released as Lasso 9.0. Technical challenges caused by these changes, coupled with limited marketing resources, led to significant community decline as the company struggled to release documentation and support for the new language.

In December 2010 a new Canadian company LassoSoft Inc. was formed, which bought and invested heavily in the Lasso 9.0 language, marketing and documentation. Kyle Jessup agreed to stay on as both Lasso&#x27;s Lead Developer and Benevolent Dictator for Life. Several releases (9.1 and 9.2) have released further developments in recent years.

==Code examples==

===Hello World===
Here are three ways to say &quot;Hello world!&quot; on a Lasso page.

&lt;?lasso &#x27;Hello World!&#x27; ?&gt;

[&#x27;Hello world!&#x27;]

Hello world!

Square brackets are reserved in Lasso, so HTML entities must be used to show square brackets on Lasso pages for other purposes than marking Lasso tags. Alternatively, printing square brackets can be by Lasso or be disabled by including [no_square_brackets] at the file top.

===Inlines===

// Find all records in a table
inline( 
 -database=&#x27;db_name&#x27;, 
 -table=&#x27;table_name&#x27;, 
 -findall 
 // Iterate through and process each row
 rows =&gt; { 
 // Output each row to the current web request
 content_body += &#x27;&lt;a href=&quot;&#x27; + column(&#x27;url&#x27;) + &#x27;&quot;&gt;&#x27; + column(&#x27;title&#x27;) + &#x27;&lt;/a&gt;&#x27;
}
Inlines are the basic Lasso tool for database actions. Database commands can be issued as above, in Lasso&#x27;s db-independent metalanguage, in which case the same search code works for MySQL, FileMaker Pro or for any other database backend with which Lasso can connect.

If needed, a SQL statement can of course be embedded in the inline when using a database server that supports SQL:

 // Execute SQL statement
 inline( 
 -database=&#x27;db_name&#x27;, 
 -sql = &#x27;SELECT * FROM table_name&#x27; 

In the above example, the dashes (-) before commands denote optional parameters. These can be specified in any order and generated dynamically; the last of any duplicate parameters take precedence. The inline command supports a large range of parameters allowing developers to interact with databases that they may not have intimate knowledge of.

Custom database connectors can be created which allows leveraging the abstracted nature of the inline command.

===99 Bottles of Beer===
The next procedural example prints out the lyrics for the song &quot;99 Bottles of Beer&quot;.
// Define a couple of useful methods

 define br =&gt; &#x27;&lt;br/&gt;&#x27;
 define bottles(n::integer) =&gt; #n != 1 ? &#x27; bottles&#x27; | &#x27; bottle&#x27;

// Declare the local that will store the lyrics as a string

 local(out = &quot;)

// Use Lasso query syntax to generate the lyric

 with n in 99 to 1 by -1 do {

 #out += #n + bottles(#n) + &#x27; of beer on the wall, &#x27; + br
 #out += #n + bottles(#n) + &#x27; of beer; &#x27; + br
 #n--
 #out += &#x27;Take one down, pass it around, &#x27; + br
 #out += #n + bottles(#n) + &#x27; of beer on the wall. &#x27; + (br * 2)

// Output result

 #out
The next example uses an OOP approach to print out the lyrics when the object is represented as a string:
// Define type
define bottles_of_beer =&gt; type {

 // Define internal data 
 data private bottles = 99

 // Define private methods
 private br =&gt; &#x27;&lt;br/&gt;&#x27;
 private s =&gt; .bottles != 1 ? &#x27;s&#x27; | &quot;
 // Generate lyrics when object represented as a string
 public asstring =&gt; {

 local(out = &quot;)
 // Use Lasso query syntax to generate the lyrics

 with n in 99 to 1 by -1 do {
 .bottles = #n
 #out += .bottles + &#x27; bottle&#x27; + .s + &#x27; of beer on the wall, &#x27; + .br
 #out += .bottles + &#x27; bottle&#x27; + .s + &#x27; of beer; &#x27; + .br
 .bottles--
 #out += &#x27;Take one down, pass it around, &#x27; + .br
 #out += .bottles + &#x27; bottle&#x27; + .s + &#x27; of beer on the wall. &#x27; + (.br * 2) 

 // Return result
 return #out
}

<text>Brodmann area 5 is one of Brodmann&#x27;s cytoarchitectural defined regions of the brain. It is involved in somatosensory processing, movement and association, and is part of the posterior parietal cortex.

==Human==
Brodmann area 5 is a subdivision of the parietal cortex, part of the cortex in the human brain. BA5 is part of the superior parietal lobule and part of the postcentral gyrus. It is situated immediately posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex.

It is bounded cytoarchitecturally by Brodmann area 2, Brodmann area 7, Brodmann area 4, and Brodmann area 31.

== Monkey ==
In guenon Brodmann area 5 is a subdivision of the parietal lobe defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It occupies primarily the superior parietal lobule. Brodmann-1909 considered it topologically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to the preparietal area 5 of the human. Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): compared to area 4 of Brodmann-1909 area 5 has a thick self-contained internal granular layer (IV); lacks a distinct internal pyramidal layer (V); has a marked sublayer 3b of pyramidal cells in the external pyramidal layer (III); has a distinct boundary between the internal pyramidal layer (V) and the multiform layer (VI); and has ganglion cells in layer V beneath its boundary with layer IV that are separated from layer VI by a wide clear zone.

In the macaque monkey the area PE corresponds to BA5.

<text>Brodmann area 7 is one of Brodmann&#x27;s cytologically defined regions of the brain corresponding to precuneus and superior parietal lobule (SPL). It is involved in locating objects in space. It serves as a point of convergence between vision and proprioception to determine where objects are in relation to parts of the body.

==In humans==
Brodmann area 7 is part of the parietal cortex in the human brain. Situated posterior to the primary somatosensory cortex (Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2), and superior to the occipital lobe, this region is believed to play a role in visuo-motor coordination (e.g., in reaching to grasp an object). In addition, area 7 along with area 5 has been linked to a wide variety of high-level processing tasks, including activation in association with language use. This function in language has been theorized to stem from how these two regions play a vital role in generating conscious constructs of objects in the world.

Brodmann area 7 spans both the medial and lateral walls of the parietal cortex. The medial part of Brodmann area 7 is called precuneus. Laterally, it is called the superior parietal lobule (SPL). At the base of the SPL is the intraparietal sulcus, below which is the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), which in turn divides into Brodmann areas 39 (angular gyrus) and 40 (supramarginal gyrus).

==In guenon==
Brodmann area 7 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined parietal region of cerebral cortex in Guenon primates. It occupies most of the parietal lobe excluding the postcentral gyrus and superior parietal lobule. This layer is distinguished by a lack of large ganglion cells in cortical layer V, slightly larger layer III pyramidal cells, and a multiform layer VI that is sharply bounded by white matter tracts.

<doc id="524258" wikidata="Q3178690" url="?curid=524258" title="Mel Allen">
<text>Mel Allen (born Melvin Allen Israel; February 14, 1913 – June 16, 1996) was an American sportscaster, best known for his long tenure as the primary play-by-play announcer for the New York Yankees. During the peak of his career in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Allen was arguably the most prominent member of his profession, his voice familiar to millions. Years after his death, he is still promoted as having been &quot;The Voice of the Yankees.&quot;

In his later years, Allen was the first host of &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Allen was born Melvin Allen Israel was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He attended the University of Alabama, where he was a member of the Kappa Nu fraternity as an undergraduate.

During his time at Alabama, Israel served as the public address announcer for Alabama Crimson Tide football games. In 1933, when the station manager or sports director of Birmingham&#x27;s radio station WBRC asked Alabama coach Frank Thomas to recommend a new play-by-play announcer, he suggested Allen. His first broadcast was Alabama&#x27;s home opener that year, against the Tulane Green Wave.

Allen graduated from the University of Alabama School of Law in 1937. Shortly after graduating, Allen took a train to New York City for a week&#x27;s vacation. While on that vacation, he auditioned for a staff announcer&#x27;s position at the CBS Radio Network. CBS executives already knew of Allen; the network&#x27;s top sportscaster, Ted Husing, had heard many of his Crimson Tide broadcasts. He was hired at $45 () a week. He often did non-sports announcing such as for big band remotes, or &quot;emceeing&quot; game shows such as &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot;, serving as an understudy for both sportscaster Husing and newscaster Bob Trout.

In his first year at CBS, Allen announced the crash of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; when the station cut away from singer Kate Smith&#x27;s show. He first became a national celebrity when he ad libbed for a half-hour during the rain-delayed Vanderbilt Cup from an airplane. In 1939, he was the announcer for the Warner Brothers &amp; Vitaphone film musical short-subject, &quot;On the Air&quot;, with Leith Stevens and the Saturday Night Swing Club.

Stephen Borelli, in his biography &quot;How About That?!&quot; (a favorite expression of Allen&#x27;s after an outstanding play by the home team), states that it was at CBS&#x27;s suggestion in 1937, the year Melvin Israel joined the network, that he go by a different last name on the air. He chose Allen, his father&#x27;s middle name as well as his own, and legally changed his name to Melvin Allen in 1943.

==Broadcasting career==

===Baseball===
Allen was used as a color commentator for CBS&#x27;s radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series. This led Wheaties to tap him to replace Arch McDonald, who was moving on to New York as the first full-time radio voice of both the Yankees and the New York Giants for their home games, as the voice of the Washington Senators for the 1939 season. Senators&#x27; owner Clark Griffith wanted Walter Johnson, a former Senators pitcher, instead of Allen, and Wheaties relented.

In June 1939, Garnett Marks, McDonald&#x27;s partner on Yankee broadcasts, twice mispronounced Ivory Soap, the Yankees&#x27; sponsor at the time, as &quot;Ovary Soap.&quot; He was fired, and Allen was tapped to replace him. McDonald himself went back to Washington after only one season, and Allen became the Yankees&#x27; and Giants&#x27; lead announcer, doing double duty for both teams because only their home games were broadcast at that time.

He periodically recounted an anecdote that occurred during his first full season (1940) as Yankee play-by-play man. Hall of Fame first baseman Lou Gehrig had been forced to retire the year before after having been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a fatal illness. Speaking with Allen in the Yankee dugout, Gehrig told him &quot;Mel, I never got a chance to listen to your games before because I was playing every day. But I want you to know they&#x27;re the only thing that keeps me going.&quot; Allen broke down in tears after Gehrig departed.

Allen&#x27;s stint with the Yankees and Giants was interrupted in 1941, when no sponsor could be found and both teams went off the air, but the broadcasts resumed in 1942. Allen was the voice of both the Yankees and the Giants until 1943, when he entered the United States Army during World War II, broadcasting on &quot;The Army Hour&quot; and Armed Forces Radio.

After the war, Allen called Yankee games exclusively. By this time, road games were added to the broadcast schedule. Before long Allen and the Yankees were fused in the public consciousness, an association strengthened by the team&#x27;s frequent World Series appearances. Allen eventually called 22 World Series on radio or television, including all but one in the 17-year stretch between 1947 and 1963, and also called 24 All-Star Games. Interestingly, Allen&#x27;s play-by-play of the 1948 World Series between the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Braves alongside Boston Braves 
announcer Jim Britt occurred because neither Cleveland Indians announcer was selected by MLB commissioner Happy Chandler; Jack Graney was ineligible due to having been a former player, and Jimmy Dudley was passed over due to a lack of experience.

In 1952, Allen was one of the first three celebrities spoofed in the just-created &quot;Mad&quot; satirical comic book. In the second issue, Allen, Giant manager Leo Durocher and Hall of Fame Yankee catcher Yogi Berra were all caricatured in a baseball story, &quot;Hex!&quot;, illustrated by Jack Davis. His likeness was also licensed by Standard Comics for a two-issue &quot;Mel Allen&#x27;s Sports Comics&quot; series between 1949 and 1950.

After Russ Hodges departed from the Yankee booth to become the longtime voice of the New York (and starting in 1958, San Francisco) Giants, the young Curt Gowdy replaced him as Allen&#x27;s broadcast partner in 1949 &amp; 1950, having been brought in from Oklahoma City after winning a national audition. Gowdy, originally from Wyoming, credited Mel Allen&#x27;s mentoring as a big factor in his own success as a broadcaster and became the voice of the Boston Red Sox from 1951 to 1965. Red Barber, the former Brooklyn Dodgers announcer who had served as Allen&#x27;s crosstown rival and frequent World Series broadcast partner, joined the Yankees&#x27; booth in 1954 and teamed with Allen until the latter&#x27;s dismissal a decade later.

Allen called the second half of Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, as broadcasting duties were split between Allen and Pittsburgh broadcaster Bob Prince. Bill Mazeroski hit a walk-off home run off Ralph Terry to win the fall classic for the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was the only walk-off home run ever to occur in a Game 7 of a World Series.

Allen lost his voice late in the fourth and last game of the 1963 World Series, in which the Dodgers swept the Yankees in four games and their longtime announcer, Vin Scully, paired with Allen on the national telecast, spontaneously took over from him for the end of the game after he could no longer talk, telling him soothingly, &quot;That&#x27;s all right, Mel.&quot; (Scully had announced the first half of the game, and Allen had begun to announce the second half.)

Among Allen&#x27;s many catchphrases were &quot;Hello there, everybody!&quot; to start a game, &quot;How a-&quot;bout&quot; that?!&quot; on outstanding Yankee plays, &quot;There&#x27;s a drive, hit deep to right. That ball is go-ing, go-ing, gonnne!!&quot; for Yankee home runs, for full counts, &quot;Three and two. What&#x27;ll he do?&quot; and after a robust Yankee swing and miss, &quot;He took a good cut!&quot;

===Other sports===

Allen variously called regular-season college football for the DuMont, NBC, and ABC networks throughout the 1950s and early &#x27;60s. He also broadcast a number of bowl games, including 14 Rose Bowls, two Orange Bowls, and two Sugar Bowls. In the National Football League, Allen served as play-by-play announcer for the Washington Redskins in 1952 and 1953 and for the New York Giants on WCBS-AM in 1960, with some of the Giants&#x27; broadcasts also carried nationally by the CBS Radio Network. He also did radio play-by-play for the Miami Dolphins and for the Miami Hurricanes.

Allen hosted &quot;Jackpot Bowling&quot; on NBC in 1959 after Leo Durocher had left to return to major league baseball coaching, but his lack of bowling knowledge made him an unpopular host and Bud Palmer replaced him as the show&#x27;s host in April.

Allen narrated a film about the 1961 Maccabiah Games which took place in Israel, titled &quot;The Sixth World Maccabiah Games&quot;.

===Non-sports work===
In the early 1940s, Allen hosted &quot;Thirty Minutes to Play&quot; on CBS radio. The program featured &quot;interviews of sports and musical personalities.&quot; In the early 1940s Mel Allen announced a few Glenn Miller radio programs as well.

In 1947, Allen was a disc jockey on 1010 WINS in New York City, with a 2–5 p.m. program daily. An ad for the station in &quot;Broadcasting&quot; called the show &quot;the initial step in our plans for bloc [sic] programming.&quot;

In the early 1960s, Allen hosted the three-hour Saturday morning segment of the weekend NBC Radio program &quot;Monitor&quot;. He also contributed sportscasts to the program until the late 1960s. Allen also provided voiceover narration for Fox Movietone newsreels for many years.

Allen appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy film &quot;The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!&quot;.

In 1994, he voiced the stadium announcer for the Broadway revival of &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;, as himself.

===Fired by the Yankees===
On September 21, 1964—prior to the start of the World Series—the Yankees informed Allen that his contract with the team would not be renewed for 1965. In those days, the main announcers for both Series participants always called the World Series on NBC television. Although Allen was thus technically eligible to call the 1964 World Series, Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick honored the Yankees&#x27; request to have retired Yankee star shortstop Phil Rizzuto, Allen&#x27;s sidekick in the radio booth, join the Series crew instead. It would be one of only four Yankee World Series going back to 1938 that Allen had not broadcast, and the first since 1943 (which he&#x27;d missed due to his Army service).

On December 17, 1964, after much media speculation and many letters to the Yankees from fans disgruntled by Allen&#x27;s absence from the Series, the Yankees issued a terse press release announcing Allen&#x27;s firing; he was replaced by Joe Garagiola. NBC and Movietone dropped him soon afterward. To this day, the Yankees have never given an explanation for the sudden firing, and rumors abounded. Depending on the rumor, Allen was either homosexual, an alcoholic, a drug addict, or had a nervous breakdown.

Years later, Allen told author Curt Smith that the Yankees had fired him under pressure from the team&#x27;s longtime sponsor, Ballantine Beer. According to Allen, he was fired as a cost-cutting move by Ballantine, which had been experiencing poor sales for years (it would eventually be sold in 1969). Smith, in his book &quot;Voices of Summer&quot;, also indicated that the medications Allen took to see him through his busy schedule may have affected his on-air performance. (Stephen Borelli, another biographer, has also pointed out that Allen&#x27;s heavy workload did not allow him time to take care of his health.)

Allen became Merle Harmon&#x27;s partner for Milwaukee Braves games in 1965, and worked Cleveland Indians games on television in 1968. But he would not commit to either team full-time, nor to the Oakland Athletics, who also wanted to hire him after the team&#x27;s move from Kansas City. Despite the firing in 1964, Allen remained loyal to the Yankees for the remainder of his life, and to this day—years after his death—he is still popularly known as &quot;the Voice of the Yankees.&quot;

The Yankees eventually brought Allen back to emcee special Yankee Stadium ceremonies, including Old-Timers&#x27; Day, which Allen had originally handled when he was lead announcer. Although Yankee broadcaster Frank Messer, who joined the club in 1968, replaced him as emcee for Old-Timers&#x27; Day and other special events like Mickey Mantle Day, the Yankees continued to invite Allen to call the actual exhibition game between the Old Timers, and to take part in players&#x27; number-retirement ceremonies.

===Return to the Yankees===
Allen was brought back to the Yankees&#x27; on-air team in 1976 as a pre/post-game host for the cable telecasts with John Sterling, and also started calling play-by-play again. He announced Yankees cable telecasts on SportsChannel New York (now MSG Plus) with Phil Rizzuto, Bill White, Frank Messer, and occasionally, Fran Healy.

Allen remained with the Yankees&#x27; play-by-play crew until 1985 and made occasional appearances on Yankee telecasts and commercials into the late 1980s. In 1990, Allen called play-by-play for a WPIX Yankees game to officially make him baseball&#x27;s first seven-decade announcer. Among the memorable moments Allen called in his latter stretch were Yankee outfielder Reggie Jackson&#x27;s 400th home run in 1980, and Yankee pitcher Dave Righetti&#x27;s no-hitter on July 4, 1983.

==&quot;This Week in Baseball&quot;==

In his later years, Allen was exposed to a new audience as the host of the syndicated highlights show &quot;This Week in Baseball&quot;, which he hosted from its inception in 1977 until his death. When FOX relaunched &quot;TWIB&quot; in 2000 (after a one-year hiatus), it used a claymation version of Allen to open and close the show until 2002.

==Computer games==
Allen recorded the play-by-play for two computer baseball games, &quot;Tony La Russa Baseball&quot; and &quot;Old Time Baseball&quot;, which were published by Stormfront Studios. The games included his signature &quot;How about that?!&quot; home run call. He also used the same catch-phrase during his cameo appearances in the films &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; (1988) and &quot;Needful Things&quot; (1993).

Producer Don Daglow said in a 1995 interview with &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; that

==Awards==
The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association inducted Allen into its Hall of Fame in 1972. In 1978, he was one of the first two winners of the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting, along with Red Barber. In 1985, Allen was inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame along with former Yankee partner (and later Red Sox and NBC Sports voice) Curt Gowdy and Chicago legend Jack Brickhouse. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. In 2009, the American Sportscasters Association ranked Allen as the #2 greatest sportscaster of all time, second only to Vin Scully.

==Death and legacy==
Allen died of heart failure at age 83 on June 16, 1996; he had undergone open-heart surgery in 1989. His one-week vacation to New York had turned into 60 years; he had settled in New York after landing a job at CBS Radio and lived there and in southwestern Connecticut for the rest of his life.

Allen was buried at Temple Beth El Cemetery in Stamford, Connecticut. On July 25, 1998, the Yankees dedicated a plaque in his memory at Monument Park at Yankee Stadium. The plaque calls him &quot;A Yankee institution, a national treasure&quot; and includes his much-spoken line &quot;How about that?!&quot;

<text>Ransom is the practice of holding a prisoner or item to extort money or property to secure their release, or the sum of money involved in such a practice.

When ransom means &quot;payment&quot;, the word comes via Old French &quot;rançon&quot; from Latin &quot;redemptio&quot;, &#x27;buying back&#x27;; compare &quot;&quot;.

== Ransom cases ==
Julius Caesar was captured by pirates near the island of Pharmacusa, and held until someone paid 50 talents to free him.

In Europe during the Middle Ages, ransom became an important custom of chivalric warfare. An important knight, especially nobility or royalty, was worth a significant sum of money if captured, but nothing if he was killed. For this reason, the practice of ransom contributed to the development of heraldry, which allowed knights to advertise their identities, and by implication their ransom value, and made them less likely to be killed out of hand. Examples include Richard the Lion Heart and Bertrand du Guesclin.

In 1532, Francisco Pizarro was paid a ransom amounting to a roomful of gold by the Inca Empire before having their leader Atahualpa, his victim, executed in a rigged trial. The ransom payment received by Pizarro is recognized as the largest ever paid to a single individual, probably over $2 billion in today&#x27;s economic markets.

===Modern===

The abduction of Charley Ross on July 1, 1874, is considered to be the first American kidnapping for ransom.

East Germany, which built the Inner German border to stop emigration, practised ransom with people. East German citizens could emigrate through the semi-secret route of being ransomed by the West German government in a process termed &quot;Freikauf&quot; (literally the buying of freedom). Between 1964 and 1989, 33,755 political prisoners were ransomed. West Germany paid over 3.4 billion DM—nearly $2.3 billion at 1990 prices—in goods and hard currency. Those ransomed were valued on a sliding scale, ranging from around 1,875 DM for a worker to around 11,250 DM for a physician. For a while, payments were made in kind using goods that were in short supply in East Germany, such as oranges, bananas, coffee, and medical drugs. The average prisoner was worth around 4,000 DM worth of goods.

==Ransom notes==

A request for ransom may be conveyed to the target of the effort by a ransom note, a written document outlining the demands of the kidnappers. In some instances, however, the note itself can be used as forensic evidence to discover the identities of unknown kidnappers, or to convict them at trial. For example, if a ransom note contains misspellings, a suspect might be asked to write a sample of text to determine if they make the same spelling errors.

Following cases where forensic evidence pinpointed particular typewriters to typed ransom notes, kidnappers started to use pre-printed words assembled from different newspapers. In popular culture, ransom notes are often depicted as being made from words in different typefaces clipped from different sources (typically newspapers), in order to disguise the handwriting of the kidnapper, leading to the phrase ransom note effect being used to describe documents containing jarringly mixed fonts. An early use of this technique in film is in the 1952 film &quot;The Atomic City&quot;.

In some instances, a person may forge a ransom note in order to falsely collect a ransom despite not having an actual connection to the kidnapper. On other occasions, a ransom note has been used as a ploy to convince family members that a person is being held for ransom when that person has actually left of their own volition or was already dead before the note was sent.

== Variations ==
There were numerous instances in which towns paid to avoid being plundered, an example being Salzburg which, under Paris Lodron, paid a ransom to Bavaria to prevent its being sacked during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. As late as the Peninsular War (1808–14), it was the belief of the English soldiers that a town taken by storm was liable to sack for three days, and they acted on their conviction at Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz and San Sebastian.

In the early 18th century, the custom was that the captain of a captured vessel gave a bond or &quot;ransom bill&quot;, leaving one of his crew as a hostage or &quot;ransomer&quot; in the hands of the captor. Frequent mention is made of the taking of French privateers which had in them ten or a dozen ransomers. The owner could be sued on his bond. Payment of ransom was banned by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1782 although this was repealed in 1864. It was generally allowed by other nations.

In the Russo-Japanese War, though no mention was made of ransom, the contributions levied by invading armies might still be accurately described by the name.

Although ransom is usually demanded only after the kidnapping of a person, it is not unheard of for thieves to demand ransom for the return of an inanimate object or body part. In 1987, thieves broke into the tomb of Argentinian president Juan Perón and then severed and stole his hands; they later demanded $8million US for their return. The ransom was not paid.

The practice of towing vehicles and charging towing fees for the vehicles&#x27; release is often dysphemised as &quot;ransoming&quot; by opponents of towing. In Scotland, booting vehicles on private property is outlawed as extortion. In England, the clamping of vehicles is theoretically the Common law offence of &quot;holding property to ransom&quot;.

Warring international military groups have demanded ransom for any personnel they can capture from their opposition or their opposition&#x27;s supporters. Ransom paid to these groups can encourage more hostage-taking.

<text>==Human==
Brodmann area 18, or BA18, is part of the occipital cortex in the human brain. It accounts for the bulk of the volume of the occipital lobe. It is known as a &quot;Visual Association Area&quot; or V2 and is a first stage in processing or feature extraction of retinotopic images from V1.

This area is also known as parastriate area 18. It is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined occipital region of cerebral cortex. In the human it is located in parts of the cuneus, the lingual gyrus and the lateral occipital gyrus (H) of the occipital lobe. It is bounded on one side by the Brodmann area 17, from which it is distinguished by absence of a band of Gennari, and on the other by the peristriate area 19 (Brodmann-1909).

==Guenon==
Brodmann area 18 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is topographically and cytoarchitecturally homologous to parastriate area 18 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): a wide, dense internal granular cell layer (IV); a distinct sublayer 3b of closely packed large pyramidal cells positioned in the external pyramidal layer (III) directly above layer IV; an almost cell-free, narrow internal pyramidal layer (V) with no larger ganglion cells; a very narrow, dense multiform layer (VI) composed of small polymorphic cells that form a distinct boundary with the underlying subcortical white matter. Like area 17 of Brodmann-1905, area 18 is relatively thin, with the three deep layers thin relative to the three outer layers, and has distinct boundaries between layers, abundance of granule cells, narrow layer VI, and sharp boundary between cortex and subcortical white matter.

<text>Brodmann area 19, or BA 19, is part of the occipital lobe cortex in the human brain. Along with area 18, it comprises the extrastriate (or peristriate) cortex. In humans with normal sight, extrastriate cortex is a visual association area, with feature-extracting, shape recognition, attentional, and multimodal integrating functions.

This area is also known as peristriate area 19, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined occipital region of cerebral cortex. In the human it is located in parts of the lingual gyrus, the cuneus, the lateral occipital gyrus (H) and the superior occipital gyrus (H) of the occipital lobe where it is bounded approximately by the parieto-occipital sulcus. It is bounded on one side by the parastriate area 18, which it surrounds. It is bounded rostrally by the angular area 39 (H) and the occipitotemporal area 37 (H) (Brodmann-1909).

==In animals==
Brodmann area 19-1909 is a subdivision of the cerebral cortex of the guenon defined on the basis of cytoarchitecture. It is cytoarchitecturally homologous to the peristriate area 19 of the human (Brodmann-1909). Distinctive features (Brodmann-1905): Compared to Brodmann area 18-1909, the pyramidal cells of sublayer 3b of the external pyramidal layer (III) are not as densely distributed, the layer is not as narrow, and its boundary with the internal granular layer (IV) is not as distinct; the cells in sublayer 3b are concentrated at its outer boundary leaving a narrow clear zone with no large pyramidal cells adjacent to layer IV; the granule cells of layer IV are less densely distributed and are intermixed with larger polymorphic cells so that, while the layer is still quite dark and prominent, it is somewhat widened and not as self-contained; the internal pyramidal layer (V) is characterized by large pyramidal ganglion cells, most in small groups, a pattern not seen in area 18; the cells in the multiform layer (VI) are clearly larger than in area 18; overall, area 19 is somewhat thicker and less densely populated than area 18.

==Function==

Area 19 is a histologically delineated band anterolaterally abutting visual area 18. Single-cell electrophysiological recordings from area 19 in the cat suggest sensitivity to motion-delineated forms; recordings from primates have yielded varying results, indicating that this area may be a heterogeneous collection of visual areas, with multiple incomplete representations of the visual scene.

In humans, this band is reputed to contain regions of the visual areas designated V3, V4, V5 (also known as the middle temporal area, or MT), and V6 (also known as dorsomedial area) in the primate. Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows the existence of various retinotopic maps within area 19. In general, the diverse fields that comprise area 19 have reciprocal connections with areas 17 and 18, as well as posterior parietal and inferior temporal association areas.

Area 19 has been noted to receive inputs from the retina via the superior colliculus and pulvinar and may contribute to the phenomenon of blindsight. In patients blind from a young age, the area has been found to be activated by somatosensory stimuli.

Because of these findings, it is thought that area 19 is the differentiation point of the two visual streams of the &#x27;what&#x27; and &#x27;where&#x27; visual pathways. The dorsal region may contain motion-sensitive neurons, and ventral areas may be specialised for object recognition.

<doc id="524266" wikidata="Q616149" url="?curid=524266" title="Demetae">
<text>The Demetae were a Celtic people of Iron Age and Roman period, who inhabited modern Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire in south-west Wales. The tribe also gave their name to the medieval Kingdom of Dyfed, the modern area and county of Dyfed and the distinct dialect of Welsh spoken in modern south-west Wales, Dyfedeg.

==Etymology and relationship to Dyfed==
The tribal name Demetae is thought to derive from a Common Celtic element related to the modern Welsh word &quot;defaid&quot; (sheep) as well as the Ancient Brythonic word &quot;defod&quot; (wealth, property or riches). This element persists in the name for the area of West Wales that the tribe inhabited, with the post-Roman Kingdom of Dyfed (proto-Celtic &quot;*dametos&quot;) a clear continuation of the Pre-Roman etymon. The name even survived the Norman conquest of Wales and the introduction of the Shire system, with Thomas Morgan noting that the Welsh inhabitants of Pembrokeshire still referred to the area as &quot;Dyfed&quot; in the nineteenth century.

This etymology is supported by the tribal area being especially noted for the cultivation of sheep, from which the Demetae would have generated much of their wealth. Even in the modern era, etymologists and antiquarians such as William Baxter noted the names Dyfed and Demetae derived as &quot;a country fit for the pasture of sheep&quot; and that the local people were noted for their cultivation of large numbers of sheep and goats from ancient times.

==History==
The Demetae are mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, as being west of the Silures. He mentions two of their towns, Moridunum (modern Carmarthen) and Luentinum (identified as the Dolaucothi Gold Mines near Pumsaint, Carmarthenshire). They are not mentioned in Tacitus&#x27; accounts of Roman warfare in Wales, which concentrate on their neighbours the Silures and Ordovices.

Vortiporius, &quot;tyrant of the Demetae&quot;, is one of the kings condemned by Gildas in his 6th century polemic &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. This probably signifies the sub-Roman petty kingdom of Dyfed.

Near the site is a group of villages called Bagrawiyah (). This city was the capital of the Kingdom of Kush for several centuries from around 590 BC, until its collapse in the 4th century AD. The Kushitic Kingdom of Meroë gave its name to the &quot;Island of Meroë&quot;, which was the modern region of Butana, a region bounded by the Nile (from the Atbarah River to Khartoum), the Atbarah and the Blue Nile.

The city of Meroë was on the edge of Butana. There were two other Meroitic cities in Butana: Musawwarat es-Sufra and Naqa. The first of these sites was given the name Meroë by the Persian king Cambyses, in honor of his sister who was called by that name. The city had originally borne the ancient appellation &quot;Saba&quot;, named after the country&#x27;s original founder. The eponym &quot;Saba&quot;, or &quot;Seba&quot;, is named for one of the sons of Cush (see Genesis 10:7). The presence of numerous Meroitic sites within the western Butana region and on the border of Butana proper is significant to the settlement of the core of the developed region. The orientation of these settlements exhibit the exercise of state power over subsistence production.

The Kingdom of Kush which housed the city of Meroë represents one of a series of early states located within the middle Nile. It was one of the earliest and most advanced states found on the African continent. Looking at the specificity of the surrounding early states within the middle Nile, one&#x27;s understanding of Meroë in combination with the historical developments of other historic states may be enhanced through looking at the development of power relation characteristics within other Nile Valley states.

The site of the city of Meroë is marked by more than two hundred pyramids in three groups, of which many are in ruins. They have the distinctive size and proportions of Nubian pyramids.

== History ==

Meroë was the southern capital of the Kingdom of Kush. The Kingdom of Kush spanned the period 800 BC – c. 350 AD. Initially, its main capital was farther north at Napata. King Aspelta moved the capital to Meroë, considerably farther south than Napata, possibly c. 591 BC, just after the sack of Napata by Egyptian Pharaoh Psamtik II.

Martin Meredith states the Kushite rulers chose Meroë, between the Fifth and Sixth Cataracts, because it was on the fringe of the summer rainfall belt, and the area was rich in iron ore and hardwood for iron working. The location also afforded access to trade routes to the Red Sea. The city of Meroë was located along the middle Nile which is of much importance due to the annual flooding of the Nile river valley and the connection to many major river systems such as the Niger which aided with the production of pottery and iron characteristic to the Meroitic kingdom that allowed for the rise in power of its people. According to partially deciphered Meroitic texts, Meroitic &quot;d&quot; was transcribed in foreign languages as &quot;r&quot;, with the native name of the city being &quot;Medewi&quot;.

===First Meroitic Period (542–315 BC)===
The Kings ruled over Napata and Meroë. The seat of government and the royal palace were in Meroë. The Main temple of Amun was located in Napata. Kings and many queens are buried in Nuri, some queens are buried in Meroë, in the West Cemetery. The earliest king was Analmaye (542–538 BC) and the last king of the first phase is Nastasen (335–315 BC)

In the fifth century BC, Greek historian Herodotus described it as &quot;a great city...said to be the mother city of the other Ethiopians.&quot;

Excavations revealed evidence of important, high ranking Kushite burials from the Napatan Period (c. 800 – c. 280 BC) in the vicinity of the settlement called the Western Cemetery. The importance of the town gradually increased from the beginning of the Meroitic Period, especially from the reign of Arakamani (c. 280 BC) when the royal burial ground was transferred to Meroë from Napata (Gebel Barkal). Royal burials formed the Pyramids of Meroë, containing the remains of the Kings and Queens of Meroë from c. 300 BC to about 350 AD.

=== Second Meroitic Period (3rd century BC) ===

The seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings and many queens are buried in Meroë, in the South Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. The first King of the period was Aktisanes (Early 3rd century BC) and the last king of the period was Sabrakamani (first half 3rd century BC).

=== Third Meroitic Period (270 BC1st century AD) ===
The seat of government and the royal palace are in Meroë. Kings are buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. Napata remained relevant for the Amun Temple. Meroë flourished and many building projects were undertaken. The first king of the period is Arakamani (270–260 BC), the last ruler is Queen Amanitore (mid/late 1st century AD)

Many artifacts were found in Meroitic tombs from around this time.

==== Conflict with Rome ====
Rome&#x27;s conquest of Egypt led to border skirmishes and incursions by Meroë beyond the Roman borders. In 23 BC, in response to a Nubian attack on southern Egypt, the Roman governor of Egypt, Publius Petronius, invaded Nubia to end the Meroitic raids. He pillaged northern Nubia and sacked Napata (22 BC) before returning home. In retaliation, the Nubians crossed the lower border of Egypt and looted many statues from the Egyptian towns near the first cataract of the Nile at Aswan. Roman forces later reclaimed some of the statues, and others were returned following the peace treaty signed in 22 BC between Rome and Meroë under Augustus and Amanirenas, respectively. One looted head, from a statue of the emperor Augustus, was buried under the steps of a temple in Meroë; it is now kept in the British Museum.
The next recorded contact between Rome and Meroë was in the autumn of 61 AD. The Emperor Nero sent a party of Praetorian soldiers under the command of a tribune and two centurions into this country, who reached the city of Meroë where they were given an escort, then proceeded up the White Nile until they encountered the swamps of the Sudd. This marked the limit of Roman penetration into Africa.

The period following Petronius&#x27; punitive expedition is marked by abundant trade finds at sites in Meroë. L. P. Kirwan provides a short list of finds from archeological sites in that country. The kingdom of Meroë began to fade as a power by the 1st or 2nd century AD, sapped by the war with Roman Egypt and the decline of its traditional industries.

Meroë is mentioned briefly in the 1st century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea:
=== Fourth Meroitic Period (1st century4th century AD) ===
Kings were buried in Meroë, in the North Cemetery, and Queens in West Cemetery. In 350 AD Meroë was destroyed by Axum. The first king of the fourth period was Shorkaror (1st century AD), while the last rulers may have been King Yesebokheamani or King Talakhidamani in the 4th century AD. The Aksumite presence was short lived before Meroë was taken by the Kingdom of Alodia.

A stele of Ge&#x27;ez of an unnamed ruler of the Kingdom of Aksum thought to be Ezana was found at the site of Meroë; from its description, in Greek, he was &quot;King of the Aksumites and the Omerites,&quot; (i.e. of Aksum and Himyar) it is likely this king ruled sometime around 330. Another inscription in Greek gives the regnal claims of Ezana:

While some authorities interpret these inscriptions as proof that the Axumites destroyed the Kingdom of Kush, others note that archeological evidence points to an economic and political decline in Meroë around 300.

== Meroë in Jewish legend ==
Jewish oral tradition avers that Moses, in his younger years, had led an Egyptian military expedition into Sudan (Kush), as far as the city of Meroë, which was then called Saba. The city was built near the confluence of two great rivers and was encircled by a formidable wall, and governed by a renegade king. To ensure the safety of his men who traversed that desert country, Moses had invented a stratagem whereby the Egyptian army would carry along with them baskets of sedge, each containing an ibis, only to be released when they approached the enemy&#x27;s country. The purpose of the birds was to kill the deadly serpents that lay all about that country. Having successfully laid siege to the city, the city was eventually subdued by the betrayal of the king&#x27;s daughter, who had agreed to deliver the city to Moses on condition that he would consummate a marriage with her, under the solemn assurance of an oath.

== Civilization ==

Meroë was the base of a flourishing kingdom whose wealth was centered around a strong iron industry. Metalworking is believed to have taken place in Meroë, possibly through bloomeries and blast furnaces. Archibald Sayce reportedly referred to it as &quot;the Birmingham of Africa&quot;, because of perceived vast production and trade of iron (a contention that is a matter of debate in modern scholarship).

The centralized control of production within the Meroitic empire and distribution of certain crafts and manufactures may have been politically important with their iron industry and pottery crafts gaining the most significant attention. The Meroitic settlements were oriented in a savannah orientation with the varying of permanent and less permanent agricultural settlements can be attributed to the exploitation of rainlands and savannah-oriented forms of subsistence.

At the time, iron was one of the most important metals worldwide, and Meroitic metalworkers were among the best in the world. Meroë traded ivory, slaves, rare skins, ostrich feathers, copper, and ebony. Meroë also exported textiles and jewelry. Their textiles were based on cotton and working on this product reached its highest achievement in Nubia around 400 BC. Furthermore, Nubia was very rich in gold. It is possible that the Egyptian word for gold, &quot;nub&quot;, was the source of name of Nubia. Trade in &quot;exotic&quot; animals from farther south in Africa was another feature of their economy.

Apart from the iron trade, pottery was a widespread and prominent industry in the Meroë kingdom. The production of fine and elaborately decorated wares was a strong tradition within the middle Nile. Such productions carried considerable social significance and are believed to be involved in mortuary rites. The long history of goods imported into the Meroitic empire and their subsequent distribution provides insight into the social and political workings of the Meroitic state. The major determinant of production was attributed to the availability of labor rather than the political power associated with land. Power was associated with control of people rather than control of territory.

The sakia, was used to move water, in conjunction with irrigation, to increase crop production.

At its peak, the rulers of Meroë controlled the Nile Valley north to south, over a straight-line distance of more than .

The King of Meroë was an autocratic ruler who shared his authority only with the Queen Mother, or Kandake. However, the role of the Queen Mother remains obscure. The administration consisted of treasurers, seal bearers, heads of archives and chief scribes, among others.

Although the people of Meroë also had southern deities such as Apedemak, the lion-son of Sekhmet (or Bast, depending upon the region), they also continued worshipping ancient Egyptian gods that they had brought with them. Among these deities were Amun, Tefnut, Horus, Isis, Thoth and Satis, though to a lesser extent.

The collapse of their external trade with other Nile Valley states may be considered one of the prime causes of the decline of royal power and disintegration of the Meroitic state in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.

== Language ==

The Meroitic language was spoken in Meroë and the Sudan during the Meroitic period (attested from 300 BC). It became extinct around 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the Meroitic alphabet: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a stylus and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of bilingual texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180 and 170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen Shanakdakhete. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.

By the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the Meroitic, consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. The Meroitic script is an alphabetic script originally derived from Egyptian hieroglyphs, used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (c. 700 – 300 BC), and first appears in the 2nd century BC. For a time, it was also possibly used to write the Nubian language of the successor Nubian kingdoms.

It is uncertain to which language family the Meroitic language is related. Kirsty Rowan suggests that Meroitic, like the Egyptian language, belongs to the Afro-Asiatic family. She bases this on its sound inventory and phonotactics, which, she proposes, are similar to those of the Afro-Asiatic languages and dissimilar from those of the Nilo-Saharan languages. Claude Rilly, based on its syntax, morphology, and known vocabulary, proposes that Meroitic, like the Nobiin language, instead belongs to the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Nilo-Saharan family.

== Archaeology ==
The site of Meroë was brought to the knowledge of Europeans in 1821 by the French mineralogist Frédéric Cailliaud (1787–1869), who published an illustrated in-folio describing the ruins. His work included the first publication of the southernmost known Latin inscription.

As Margoliouth notes in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;, small scale excavations occurred in 1834, led by Giuseppe Ferlini, who, as Margoliouth states, &quot;discovered (or professed to discover) various antiquities, chiefly in the form of jewelry, now in the museums of Berlin and Munich.&quot; Margoliouth continues,


== World Heritage listing ==

In June 2011, the Archeological Sites of Meroë were listed by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites.

During the Sudanese civil war (2023–present) on 14 January 2024, the Sudanese Armed Forces launched airstrikes in the ancient Meroitic sites of Naqa and Musawwarat es-Sufra, which are both designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites, following incursions there by the Rapid Support Forces.

<text>A street artist is a person who makes art in public places. Street artists include portrait artists, caricaturists, graffiti artists, muralists and people making crafts. Street artists can also refer to street performers such as musicians, acrobats, jugglers, living statues, and street theatre performers. Street artists can be seen throughout the world.

==Legality==
Some countries and sub-national jurisdictions require a license or permit in order to do business as a street artist. Without legal authorization, artists run the risk of being fined or arrested by the police if municipal ordinances prohibit their activities. For graffiti artists and muralists, part of the experience may be finding a suitable wall, permitted or not. In some municipalities, artists may apply for a license that allows them to legally occupy public space or a permit to paint a building. These licenses and permits place limitations on where the artist can perform or create their art, and may also regulate what artists are allowed to sell or depict. San Francisco, Berkeley, and Seattle are American cities that regulate the display and trade of artists selling their wares on the street. Additionally, San Francisco has a public approval process for murals painted on public buildings or using public money on private property.

Graffiti art is often seen as a controversial art form and can at times be referred to as vandalism. However some graffiti artists have become famous for their art, notably Banksy and Shepard Fairey also known as Obey.

<text>Lise-Marie Morerod (born 16 April 1956) is a Swiss former slalom skier. In 1977, she was women&#x27;s overall season champion. 

==Biography==
She born in Les Diablerets, Vaud. In 1972, at age 15, she became Swiss champion in giant slalom. Her winning the bronze medal in the slalom race at the FIS Alpine Skiing World Championships was a great surprise because she was an unknown racer. (Best racers wear bib numbers between 1 and 15; she had 39.) It was the only medal won by the Swiss racers at their &quot;Home World Championships&quot;. At the 1976 Winter Olympics, she took fourth place in the giant slalom but didn&#x27;t finish the slalom race. 
She achieved 24 victories and another 17 podiums in World Cup races and was the first Swiss racer to win the Overall World Cup.

A car accident in July 1978 left Morerod in a coma for six weeks and led to a six-month hospital stay. The injuries she sustained in the accident left her with long-term memory problems. She returned to the World Cup in 1979, but failed to find her previous form and did not qualify for the 1980 Winter Olympics. She retired after the 1979–80 season.

<doc id="524271" wikidata="Q7969020" url="?curid=524271" title="Ward Hill Lamon">
<text>Ward Hill Lamon (January 6, 1828 – May 7, 1893) was a personal friend and self-appointed bodyguard of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. Lamon was famously absent the night Lincoln was assassinated at Ford&#x27;s Theatre on April 14, 1865, having been sent by Lincoln to Richmond, Virginia.

==Background==
Lamon&#x27;s family name was spelled by some relatives with an &quot;e&quot; and by others with an &quot;a&quot;, and was pronounced as &quot;lemon&quot; regardless of spelling. Lamon&#x27;s relationship with Lincoln has been traced by Clint Clay Tilton in &quot;Lincoln and Lamon&quot;. Lamon was born near Winchester, Virginia, studied medicine for two years, and moved to Danville, Illinois, when he was 19 to live with relatives. He attended the University of Louisville to receive his law degree and was admitted to the Illinois bar in 1851. In 1850, he moved back to Virginia, married Angelina Turner, and then returned to Illinois to practice law. Angelina was a daughter of Ehud and Priscilla Strode Turner, whose house at Beddington, West Virginia, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002 as the Priscilla Strode Turner House. Angelina died in April 1859, leaving a daughter, Dorothy, who was raised in Danville by Lamon&#x27;s sister, Mrs. William Morgan. In November 1860, Lamon married Sally Logan, daughter of Judge Stephen T. Logan. Logan had been Lincoln&#x27;s law partner from 1841 to 1844.

==Early years with Lincoln==
Lamon&#x27;s professional association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting attorney for the Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to Bloomington, Illinois, in 1858. While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of abolitionism set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young Republican Party and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860. Lincoln was up against New York Senator William Seward for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters. When Lincoln was elected president, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post but received a letter from his friend that said, &quot;Dear Hill, I need you. I want you to go to Washington with me and be prepared for a long stay.&quot; Lamon then accompanied him as he traveled from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington D.C. in February 1861. This trip would prove to be eventful.

==Lamon and the Baltimore Plot, 1861==

Lamon was a physically imposing man, and during the presidency, often took it upon himself to guard Lincoln. In February 1861, detective Allan Pinkerton uncovered a plot whereby Lincoln would be assassinated when he arrived in Baltimore on his way to his inauguration in Washington. Pinkerton advised Lincoln that rather than ride publicly through the city between train stations as planned, he should take a midnight train straight through to Washington. Lamon was the sole friend chosen to accompany him.

Lamon and Pinkerton famously clashed over the President-elect&#x27;s protection. Lamon offered Lincoln &quot;a Revolver and a Bowie Knife&quot; but Pinkerton protested that he &quot;would not for the world have it said that Mr. Lincoln had to enter the national Capital armed&quot;. The two men further disagreed over Lamon&#x27;s desire to alert the &quot;Chicago Journal&quot; to their early arrival in Washington because Pinkerton, more prudently, wished not to publicize their change of plans. In Pinkerton&#x27;s account of the plot, he wrote disparagingly of Lamon, referring to him as a &quot;brainless, egotistical fool&quot;. Pinkerton allowed William Herndon to copy his report, which was obtained by Lamon when he purchased Herndon&#x27;s papers to write his &quot;Life of Abraham Lincoln&quot;. However, when Herndon first requested copies of Pinkerton&#x27;s report, Pinkerton agreed only on the condition that certain material be kept confidential, specifically naming his remarks about Lamon.

Lincoln was secreted through Baltimore during the night. The train carrying Mrs. Lincoln and others went through Baltimore unharmed the next day, despite the claim of Pinkerton that hand grenades and firebombs would be used to attack the train.

Lamon summed up his disbelief in the plot in the biography: &quot;It is perfectly manifest that there was no conspiracy, – no conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of three; no definite purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr. Lincoln in Baltimore.&quot;

==Lamon as U.S. Marshal and his relationship with Lincoln 1861–1865==
Shortly after his inauguration in 1861, Lincoln appointed Lamon United States Marshal of the District of Columbia; he resigned his commission in June 1865. One of Lamon&#x27;s first acts as Marshal was to visit Fort Sumter, South Carolina in March 1861, to meet with Major Robert Anderson, commander of the fort, and Governor Francis Pickens. Reports vary on Lamon&#x27;s responsibilities with regard to that visit.

One account chronicles that Lamon was just one of a few emissaries sent by Lincoln, the first being Captain Gustavus Fox, who went to determine if Fort Sumter could be relieved by sea. Lamon was sent concurrently with another Illinois friend of Lincoln&#x27;s, Stephen Hurlbut, with the implication that Lamon was sent to take the focus off of Hurlbut&#x27;s visit as Hurlbut was there to measure anti-Union sentiment in Charleston (he discovered it was high). Lamon incurred Lincoln&#x27;s displeasure by meeting with Governor Pickens and informing him of the government&#x27;s interest in withdrawing from Fort Sumter.

Another account represents Lamon as traveling with the full confidence of Lincoln: &quot;It called for courage and the trip was made over the objection of Secretary Seward. &#x27;Mr. Secretary,&#x27; said Lincoln, &#x27;I have known to be in many a close place and he&#x27;s never been in one he didn&#x27;t get out of. By Jing. I&#x27;ll risk it. Go, Lamon and God bless you.&#x27;&quot; Yet another account characterizes Lamon as being under Seward&#x27;s influence and angering Lincoln: &quot;It was under Seward&#x27;s influence that he actually told Governor Pickens that he had come to arrange for the withdrawal of the garrison, and that after his return he wrote the governor that he would be back in a few days to assist with the evacuation. He also gave Major Anderson the impression that no relief would be attempted. All this was outrageous, and when Lincoln heard of Lamon&#x27;s letter to Pickens, he indignantly denied that the man possessed any authority to make such a statement.&quot; Missions to Fort Sumter aside, the marshal&#x27;s position was not an onerous one and afforded Lamon legitimate access to the President. What Lamon took upon himself, however, was to represent himself as Lincoln&#x27;s bodyguard, which he did out of friendship rather than the requirements of the position.

Lamon took this so seriously that his friend Leonard Swett recounted that in the three months he stayed with Lamon in the Fall of 1864, he saw Lamon leave every night to go to the White House where he patrolled the grounds. Presidential secretary John Hay adds to this portrait of devotion by noting in his diary that one night he observed Lamon wrap himself up in his cloak and lie down to sleep in front of Lincoln&#x27;s bedroom door. Lamon was not in Washington on the night of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, being on assignment in Richmond. In his &quot;Recollections of Abraham Lincoln,&quot; Lamon reveals that before he left for Richmond, he implored the president not to &quot;go out at night after [he] was gone, &quot;particularly to the theatre.&quot;&quot; After the assassination, Lamon accompanied the funeral procession to Springfield, Illinois.

==Lamon as Lincoln&#x27;s biographer==

After Lincoln&#x27;s death, Lamon published two books (one posthumously) about the late President. The more famous of the two is a biography that was largely ghostwritten by Chauncey Black, the son of former Attorney General of the United States Jeremiah Black. The elder Black was Lamon&#x27;s law partner from 1865 until 1879. The book, published in 1872 by James R. Osgood and Company of Boston under the title &quot;The Life of Abraham Lincoln; From his Birth to his Inauguration as President&quot;, contained allegations and personal information about Lincoln that were deemed scandalous by nineteenth century society. It was a financial failure. One of the most shocking claims was that Lincoln was not a man of faith: &quot;Mr. Lincoln was never a member of any church, nor did he believe in the divinity of Christ, or the inspiration of the Scriptures in the sense understood by evangelical Christians.&quot; The basis of the book was the papers of William Herndon, which Lamon purchased for either $2,000 or $4,000. Shortly after his death, Lamon&#x27;s daughter collected and edited many of his unpublished writings about Lincoln into a biography of the president, &quot;Recollections of Abraham Lincoln&quot; (1895). In &quot;Recollections&quot;, Lamon reversed his earlier denial of the Baltimore plot of 1861, writing, &quot;It is now an acknowledged fact that there was never a moment from the day he crossed the Maryland line, up until the time of his assassination, that he was not in danger of death by violence, and that his life was spared until the night of the 14th of April, 1865, only through the ceaseless and watchful care of the guards thrown around him.&quot; The authenticity of this book is generally more highly regarded by the scholarly community than is the earlier volume by Lamon and Black.

According to Lamon, three days before he was shot, Lincoln related a dream in which he wandered the White House searching for the source of mournful sounds:

However, Lincoln later told Lamon that &quot;In this dream it was not me, but some other fellow, that was killed. It seems that this ghostly assassin tried his hand on someone else.&quot; Although perpetuated by various authors, historians Don E. Fehrenbacher and Virginia Fehrenbacher have cited internal inconsistencies and external evidence regarding Lamon&#x27;s account that lead them to question its veracity. Lamon stated that the incident had occurred only a few days prior to the assassination, yet within Lincoln&#x27;s monologue he related at one point that the dream occurred &quot;the other night&quot; and also &quot;about ten days ago.&quot; The Fehrenbachers also note that although Lincoln stated in the account that on the night of the dream he &quot;had been up waiting for important dispatches from the front,&quot; during the period of March 24 to April 9, he in fact had been at the front, rather than in the White House. In addition, there was no contemporaneous account of the dream following the assassination. No one mentioned it in the voluminous writings of the period, not Mary Lincoln, Lamon, anyone else at the supposed telling of the dream, or anyone to whom those who heard it may have relayed it.

==Later life and death==
Lamon had tendered his resignation as Marshal of the District of Columbia in June 1865. In April 1866, Lamon purchased the funeral rail car that transported Lincoln&#x27;s remains to Springfield, Illinois. The price he paid for the rail car was a little less than $10,000. He was offered the cabinet position of Postmaster General but declined. He formed his law partnership with Jeremiah Black (referenced above), and the law practice dissolved in 1879 due to the poor reception of &quot;The Life of Lincoln&quot; ghostwritten by Black&#x27;s son Chauncey. In 1879, Lamon and his wife Sally moved to Boulder, Colorado, and later to Denver where he formed a friendship with poet Eugene Field. The ill health of both Lamon and Sally caused them to return to Washington in 1886, and in 1889, they traveled to Europe for the spas and subsequently Sally died in Brussels in 1892.
Lamon moved to Martinsburg, West Virginia, where he was cared for by his daughter Dorothy until his death on May 7, 1893. He was 65 years old. Lamon was buried in Gerrardstown, West Virginia, in the Presbyterian Cemetery. (Sally had been buried in Springfield, Illinois.) The home built by Lamon&#x27;s cousin Joseph in Danville, Illinois, has become a museum.

==Perceptions of Lamon==
Some contemporaries and biographers of Lincoln tend to treat Lamon with a certain casual contempt. In 1862, during his tenure as Marshal, a number of senators called for his removal from office. Although Lincoln refused this demand, the Senate was able to decrease some of Lamon&#x27;s official duties and thus reduce his income. Allan Pinkerton&#x27;s opinion of him was voiced above, during the Baltimore Plot. Historian Allan Nevins in &quot;The War for the Union&quot; characterizes Lamon as &quot;a big loquacious bumbler of more self-assurance than discretion&quot;. Even one of Nevin&#x27;s footnotes that discusses the controversial trip to Charleston in 1861 further dismisses Lamon: &quot;Lamon&#x27;s papers in the Huntington Library throw no light on the subject except to confirm his general ineptness.&quot; Some accounts are more sympathetic to Lamon, however. In 1931, Clint Clay Tilton repeatedly affirmed Lamon&#x27;s generosity and good humor and dubbed him &quot;the Cavalier&quot;. When Lamon campaigned for Lincoln&#x27;s re-election in 1864, a song was written which included the following verse:

A great good man is Ward Hill Lamon;&lt;br&gt;
Abe is Pythias; he is Damon;&lt;br&gt; 
He&#x27;s the President&#x27;s protector,&lt;br&gt;
He&#x27;s his political protector,&lt;br&gt;
Who?&lt;br&gt;
Ward Hill Lamon. Ward Hill Lamon.

The tune to this song has been lost to history; the unusual metrical pattern is compatible with &quot;Stille Nacht&quot;, the tune for &quot;Silent Night.&quot;

<doc id="524278" wikidata="Q1723528" url="?curid=524278" title="1925 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1925 Canadian federal election was held on October 29, 1925 to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 15th Parliament of Canada. The Conservative party took the most seats in the House of Commons, although not a majority. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberal Party was invited to form a minority government. Unlike the Conservative party, King&#x27;s Liberals had the conditional support of the many Farmer/Progressive MPs.

The government fell the following year. Governor General Baron Byng of Vimy offered the Conservatives under Meighen a chance to form government. This too fell in short order. Byng&#x27;s action in refusing King&#x27;s request became the main issue of the 1926 election under the name &quot;King–Byng Affair&quot;.

==Background==
The previous federal election in 1921 had seen Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals fall narrowly short of winning a parliamentary majority, with Arthur Meighen&#x27;s Conservatives falling to being the third-largest party, and the new Progressive Party, which had nominated candidates for the first time that year, held the balance of power. King was able to rule with the tacit support of the Progressives, and was not facing a statutory federal election until December 1926; however, a budget proposed in September 1925 by finance minister William Stevens Fielding was unexpectedly voted down in parliament, obligating Mackenzie King to resign as Prime Minister and recommend to the Governor General, Baron Byng of Vimy to hold a new election (theoretically King could have recommended that Byng allow either Meighen or Progressive leader Robert Forke to form a government, but the Conservatives were far short of the number of MPs required to form a stable government, and Forke had no interest in being Prime Minister).

==Aftermath and the King-Byng Affair==
The Liberals won fewer seats than the Conservatives, who were left eight seats short of a majority. The Progressives lost almost two thirds of their seats from the previous election, but they still held enough seats to control the balance of power. King decided to hold on to power with the help of the Progressives. The Progressives were closely aligned with the Liberals and enabled King to form a minority government.

That plan was complicated by the fact that his party won fewer seats than the Conservatives and that King himself had lost his seat in the House of Commons. Meighen was outraged by King&#x27;s move and demanded for King to resign from the Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Byng privately agreed that the Conservatives should be allowed to form the next government and felt that the Liberal-Progressive pact was a corrupt bargain, but he found that there were no valid legal grounds for refusing to allow King to continue in office. King asked a Liberal Member of Parliament from Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, to resign so that he could run in the resulting by-election. Prince Albert was one of the safest seats in Canada for the Liberals, and King won easily.

With King back in Parliament, a huge scandal rocked the King cabinet when one of his appointees was discovered to be accepting bribes from a male lover. Anticipating a vote of censure by the Commons, King asked Byng to call an election. The Governor General refused, and King resigned on June 28, 1926. Meighen was then invited to form a government.

King claimed that was interference in Canadian politics by an official appointed by a foreign power. King showed rare fire and rallied the Progressives back into his camp. He defeated Meighen on a vote of confidence after only three days, which made the Meighen government of 1926 the shortest-lasting government in Canadian history. This time, Byng called an election.

<text>Ernest Benjamin Esclangon (17 March 1876 – 28 January 1954) was a French astronomer and mathematician.

Born in Mison, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, in 1895 he started to study mathematics at the École Normale Supérieure, graduating in 1898. Looking for some means of financial support while he completed his doctorate on quasi-periodic functions, he took a post at the Bordeaux Observatory, teaching some mathematics at the university.

During World War I, he worked on ballistics and developed a novel method for precisely locating enemy artillery. When a gun is fired, it initiates a spherical shock wave but the projectile also generates a conical wave. By using the sound of distant guns to compare the two waves, Escaglon was able to make accurate predictions of gun locations.

After the armistice in 1919, Esclangon became director of the Strasbourg Observatory and professor of astronomy at the university the following year. In 1929, he was appointed director of the Paris Observatory and of the International Time Bureau, and elected to the Bureau des Longitudes in 1932. He is perhaps best remembered for initiating in 1933 the first &quot;speaking clock&quot; service, reportedly to relieve the observatory staff from the numerous telephone calls requesting the exact time. He was elected to the Académie des Sciences in 1939.

Esclangon was the President of the Société astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1933–1935. In 1935, he received the Prix Jules Janssen, the society&#x27;s highest award.

Serving as director of the Paris Observatory throughout World War II and the German occupation of Paris, he retired in 1944. He died in Eyrenville, France.

The binary asteroid 1509 Esclangona is named after him.

The lunar crater Esclangon is named after him.

His doctoral students include Daniel Barbier, Édmée Chandon, Louis Couffignal, André-Louis Danjon, and Nicolas Stoyko.

<text>Maximillian George Carnarius (January 11, 1890 – May 30, 1976), also known as Max George Carey, was an American professional baseball center fielder and manager. Carey played in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1910 through 1926 and for the Brooklyn Robins from 1926 through 1929. He managed the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1932 and 1933.

Carey starred for the Pirates, helping them win the 1925 World Series. During his 20-year career, he led the league in stolen bases ten times and finished with 738 steals, a National League record until 1974 and still the 9th-highest total in major league history. Carey was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1961.

==Early life==
Maximillian George Carnarius was born in Terre Haute, Indiana, on January 11, 1890. His father was a Prussian soldier and swimming teacher. He had emigrated to the United States after the Franco-Prussian War and worked as a contractor.

Carey&#x27;s parents wanted their son to become a Lutheran minister. He attended Concordia College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, studying in the pre-ministerial program. He also played baseball, and was a member of the swimming and track-and-field teams. After graduating in 1909, he went to Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri.

==Professional career==

===Minor league baseball===
In the summer of 1909, Carey attended a game of minor league baseball&#x27;s Central League between the Terre Haute Hottentots and the South Bend Greens. South Bend was without a starting shortstop, as they had sold theirs to another team. Carey found Aggie Grant, South Bend&#x27;s manager, and convinced Grant to give him the opportunity to fill in for the remainder of the season, based on his track-and-field skills. He used the name &quot;Max Carey&quot; in order to retain his amateur status at Concordia College. He had a .158 batting average and committed 24 errors in 48 games.

Carey returned to play for South Bend in the 1910 season. The team had a new shortstop, Alex McCarthy, so Carey agreed to play as their left fielder. He had a .298 batting average with 86 stolen bases in 96 games. He also recorded 25 assists. Able to make a career in baseball, Carey decided to drop out of Concordia.

===Major League Baseball===
The president of the Central League recommended Carey to the Pittsburgh Pirates of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) National League towards the end of the 1910 season. The Pirates bought Carey and McCarthy from South Bend on August 15. Carey made his MLB debut with the Pirates, appearing in two games as a replacement for Fred Clarke during the 1910 season.
In 1911, Carey played in 122 games as the Pirates&#x27; center fielder, replacing Tommy Leach. He had a .258 batting average on the season. The next year, he succeeded Clarke as the Pirates&#x27; left fielder on a permanent basis. In 1913, Carey led the National League in plate appearances (692), at bats (620), runs scored (99), and stolen bases (61). In 1914, he led the National League in games played (156), at bats (596), and triples (17). He led the National League in steals in 1915 (36), 1916 (63), 1917 (46), and 1918 (58), while also leading the league with 62 walks in 1918. After the 1915 season, Carey went on a barnstorming tour with Dave Bancroft.

Carey missed much of the 1919 season with an injury, but returned to form in the 1920 season. He again led the National League in steals in 1920, with 52, in the 1922 season with 51, in the 1923 season with 51, in the 1924 season with 49, and in the 1925 season with 46. In the 1922 season, he was only caught stealing twice.

In 1924, Carey altered his batting stance based on Ty Cobb&#x27;s. He had a .343 batting average in the 1925 season, and the Pirates won the National League pennant that year. In the deciding game of the 1925 World Series, Carey had four hits, including three doubles, off of Walter Johnson. Carey&#x27;s .458 batting average led all players in the series, and the Pirates defeated the American League&#x27;s Washington Senators. He hit for a batting average over .300 three seasons in a row from 1921 to 1923. He led the league in stolen bases eight times, including each season between 1922 and 1924. He regularly stole 40 or more bases and maintained a favorable steal percentage; in 1922 he stole 51 bases and was caught only twice. He also stole home 33 times in his career, second best only to Ty Cobb&#x27;s 50 on the all-time list.
In 1926, Clarke, now the team vice president, was also serving as an assistant to manager Bill McKechnie. Clarke would sit on the bench in full uniform and give advice to McKechnie. Carey ended up in a slump that summer and one day Clarke commented to McKechnie that they should replace Carey, even if they had to replace him with a pitcher. When Carey found out about the remark, he called a team meeting, along with Babe Adams and Carson Bigbee, who were also discontented with Clarke. The players voted on whether Clarke should remain on the bench during games. The players voted 18–6 in favor of Clarke remaining on the bench. Clarke found out about the meeting and ordered that the responsible players were to be disciplined. Adams and Bigbee were released, while Carey was suspended. The Pirates placed Carey on waivers and he was claimed by the Brooklyn Robins. Carey played his final three and a half years with the Robins, but he was aging and no longer the same player. Carey retired in 1929.

===Later career===
Carey returned to the Pirates as a coach for the 1930 season. After sitting out the 1931 season, he became the manager of the Dodgers before the 1932 season, succeeding Wilbert Robinson. He traded for outfielder Hack Wilson, and traded Babe Herman, also an outfielder, for third baseman Joe Stripp. Behind Wilson, Brooklyn finished in third place in the National League in 1932. However, the team struggled in the 1933 season, leading to outrage when the club renewed his contract for 1934 in August. Receiving criticism by Brooklyn newspapers, he was replaced before the 1934 season by Casey Stengel, and remarked that he became &quot;the first manager fired by the newspapers&quot;. The organization stated that they fired Carey due to his inability to get along with his players.

Carey worked as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles and served as a minor league manager. He was the manager and general manager of the Miami Wahoos of the Florida East Coast League in 1940 and 1941. In 1944, Carey became the manager of the Milwaukee Chicks in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). That year, Milwaukee won the AAGPBL pennant. Beginning in 1945, he spent several years as the league&#x27;s president. He then spent three seasons managing the league&#x27;s Fort Wayne Daisies.

==Later life==
Carey moved to Florida, and became involved in real estate. Carey lost more than $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in the 1929 stock market crash. He became a writer in the 1950s. He self-published a book on baseball strategy and authored magazine articles for publications such as &quot;Esquire&quot;. He also served on the Florida State Racing Commission.

In 1961, the Veterans Committee elected Carey and Billy Hamilton to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1968, Carey joined other athletes in supporting Richard Nixon&#x27;s presidential campaign. The athletes created a committee called Athletes for Nixon.

Carey died on May 30, 1976, at age 86 in Miami, Florida. He was buried in Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum (now Caballero Rivero Woodlawn North Park Cemetery and Mausoleum). He was survived by his wife, Aurelia, and a son, Max Jr.

==Legacy==
Carey was nicknamed &quot;Scoop&quot; for his ability to catch fly balls in front of him. His mark of 738 stolen bases remained a National League record, until Lou Brock surpassed it in 1974.

When Carey was young, his mother sewed special pads into his uniform to protect his legs and hips while sliding. Carey went on to patent these sliding pads. He also shared a patent on a liniment called Minute-Rub.

<text>The Merino is a breed or group of breeds of domestic sheep, characterised by very fine soft wool. It was established in Spain near the end of the Middle Ages, and was for several centuries kept as a strict Spanish monopoly; exports of the breed were not allowed, and those who tried risked capital punishment. During the eighteenth century, flocks were sent to the courts of a number of European countries, including France (where they developed into the Rambouillet), Hungary, the Netherlands, Prussia, Saxony and Sweden.

The Merino subsequently spread to many parts of the world, including South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. They are presently common in South Africa. Numerous recognised breeds, strains and variants have developed from the original type; these include, among others, the American Merino and Delaine Merino in the Americas, the Australian Merino, Booroola Merino and Peppin Merino in Oceania, and the Gentile di Puglia, Merinolandschaf and Rambouillet in Europe.

The Australian Poll Merino is a polled (hornless) variant. Rams of other Merino breeds have long, spiral horns which grow close to the head, while ewes are usually hornless.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;merino&quot; was not documented in Spain until the early 15th century, and its origin is disputed.

Two suggested origins for the Spanish word &quot;merino&quot; are given in:

*It may be an adaptation to the sheep of the name of a Castilian official inspector (&quot;merino&quot;) over a &quot;merindad&quot;, who may have also inspected sheep pastures. This word is from the medieval Latin &quot;maiorinus&quot;, a steward or head official of a village, from &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;greater&quot;. However, there is no indication in any of the Leonese or Castilian law codes that this official, either named as &quot;maiorinus&quot; or &quot;merino&quot; had any duties connected with sheep, and the late date at which &quot;merino&quot; was first documented makes any connection with the name of an early medieval magistrate implausible.
*It also may be from the name of an Imazighen tribe, the &quot;Marini&quot; (or in Spanish, &quot;Benimerines&quot;), who occupied parts of the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during the 12th and 13th centuries. This view gains some support from the derivation of many medieval Spanish pastoral terms from Arabic or Berber languages. However, an etymology based on a 12th-century origin for Merino sheep when the Marinids were in Spain is unacceptable; the origin of the breed occurred much later.

=== Origin ===
The three theories of the origins of the Merino breed in Spain are: the importation of North African flocks in the 12th century; its origin and improvement in Extremadura in the 12th and 13th centuries; the selective crossbreeding of Spanish ewes with imported rams at several different periods, so that its characteristic fine wool was not fully developed until the 15th century or even later. The first theory accepts that the breed was improved by later importation of North African rams and the second accepts an initial stock of North African sheep related to types from Asia Minor, and both claim an early date and largely North African origin for the Merino breed.

Sheep were relatively unimportant in the Islamic Caliphate of Córdoba, and there is no record of extensive transhumance before the caliphate&#x27;s fall in the 1030s. The Marinids, when a nomadic Zenata Berber tribe, held extensive sheep flocks in what is now Morocco, and its leaders who formed the Marinid Sultanate militarily intervened in southern Spain, supporting the Emirate of Granada several times in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Although they may possibly have brought new breeds of sheep into Spain, there is no definite evidence that the Marinids did bring extensive flocks to Spain. As the Marinids arrived as an intervening military force, they were hardly in a position to protect extensive flocks and practice selective breeding.

The third theory, that the Merino breed was created in Spain over several centuries with a strong Spanish heritage, rather than simply being an existing North African strain that was imported in the 12th century, is supported both by recent genetic studies and the absence of definitive Merino wool before the 15th century. The predominant native sheep breed in Spain from pre-Roman times was the churro, a homogeneous group closely related to European sheep types north of the Pyrenees and bred mainly for meat and milk, with coarse, coloured wool. Churro wool had little value, except where its ewes had been crossed with a fine wool breed from southern Italy in Roman times. Genetic studies have shown that the Merino breed most probably developed by the crossing of churro ewes with a variety of rams of other breeds at different periods, including Italian rams in Roman times, North African rams in the medieval period, and English rams from fine-wool breeds in the 15th century.

Although Spain exported wool to England, the Low Countries and Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries, it was only used to make cheap cloth. The earliest evidence of fine Spanish wool exports was to Italy in the 1390s and Flanders in the 1420s, although in both cases fine English wool was preferred. Spain became noted for its fine wool (spinning count between 60s and 64s) in the late 15th century, and by the mid-16th century its Merino wool was acknowledged to equal that of the finest English wools.

The earliest documentary evidence for Merino wools in Italy dates to the 1400s, and in the 1420s and 1430s, Merino wools were being mixed with fine English wool in some towns in the Low Countries to produce high quality cloth. However, it was only in the mid-16th century that the most expensive grades of cloth could be made entirely from Merino wool, after its quality had improved to equal that of the finest English wools, which were in increasingly short supply at that time.

Preserved medieval woollen fabrics from the Low Countries show that, before the 16th century, only the best quality English wools had a fineness of staple comparable to modern Merino wool. The wide range of Spanish wools produced in the 13th and early 14th centuries were mostly used domestically for cheap, coarse and light fabrics, and were not Merino wools. Later in the 14th century, similar non-Merino wools were exported from the northern Castilian ports of San Sebastián, Santander, and Bilbao to England and the Low Countries to make coarse, cheap cloth. The quality of Spanish wools exported increased markedly in the late 15th century, as did their price, promoted by the efforts of the monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella to improve quality.

Spain built up a virtual monopoly in fine wool exports in the final decades of the 15th century and in the 16th century, creating a substantial source of income for Castile. In part, this was because most English wool was woven and made into textile goods within England by the 16th century, rather than being exported.

Many of the Castillian Merino flocks were owned by nobility or the church, although Alfonso X realised that granting the urban elites of the towns of Old Castile and León transhumant rights would create an additional source of royal income and counteract the power of the privileged orders. During the late 15th, 16th and early 17th century, two-thirds of the sheep migrating annually were held in flocks of less than 100 sheep and very few flocks exceeded 1,000 sheep. By the 18th century, there were fewer small owners, and several owners held flocks of more than 20,000 sheep, but owners of small to moderately-sized flocks remained, and the Mesta was never simply a combination of large owners.

The transhumant sheep grazed the southern Spanish plains in winter and the northern highlands in summer. The annual migrations to and from Castile and León, where the sheep were owned and where they had summer pasturage, was organised and controlled by the Mesta along designated sheep-walks, or &quot;cañadas reales&quot; and arranged for suitable grazing, water and rest stops in these routes, and for shearing when the flocks started their return north.

The three Merino strains that founded the world&#x27;s Merino flocks are the Royal Escurial flocks, the Negretti and the Paula. Among Merino bloodlines stemming from Vermont in the US, three historical studs were highly important: Infantado, Montarcos and Aguires. In recent times, Merino and breeds deriving from Merino stocks have spread worldwide. However, there has been a substantial decline in the numbers of several European Merino breeds, which are now considered to be endangered breeds and are no longer the subject of genetic improvement. In Spain, there are now two populations, the commercial Merino flocks, most common in the province of Extremadura and an &quot;historical&quot; Spanish Merino strain, developed and conserved in a breeding centre near Cordoba. The commercial Merino flocks show considerable genetic diversity, probably because of their cross-breeding with non-Spanish Merino-derived breeds since the 1960s, to create a strain more suitable for meat production. The historical Spanish strain, bred from animals selected from the main traditional Spanish genetic lines to ensure the conservation of a purebred lineage, exhibits signs of inbreeding.

Before the 18th century, the export of Merinos from Spain was a crime punishable by death. In the 18th century, small exportation of Merinos from Spain and local sheep were used as the foundation of Merino flocks in other countries. In 1723, some were exported to Sweden, but the first major consignment of Escurials was sent by Charles III of Spain to his cousin, Prince Xavier the Elector of Saxony, in 1765. Further exportation of Escurials to Saxony occurred in 1774, to Hungary in 1775 and to Prussia in 1786. Later in 1786, Louis XVI of France received 366 sheep selected from 10 different cañadas; these founded the stud at the Royal Farm at Rambouillet. In addition to the fine wool breeds mentioned, other breeds derived from Merino stocks were developed to produce mutton, including the French Ile de France and Berrichon du Cher breeds. Merino sheep were also sent to Eastern Europe where their breeding began in Hungary in 1774

The Rambouillet stud enjoyed some undisclosed genetic development with some English long-wool genes contributing to the size and wool-type of the French sheep. Through one ram in particular named Emperor – imported to Australia in 1860 by the Peppin brothers of Wanganella, New South Wales – the Rambouillet stud had an enormous influence on the development of the Australian Merino.

Sir Joseph Banks procured two rams and four ewes in 1787 by way of Portugal, and in 1792 purchased 40 Negrettis for King George III to found the royal flock at Kew. In 1808, 2000 Paulas were imported.

The King of Spain also gave some Escurials to the Dutch government in 1790; these thrived in the Dutch Cape Colony (South Africa). In 1788, John MacArthur, from the Clan Arthur (or MacArthur Clan) introduced Merinos to Australia from South Africa.

From 1765, the Germans in Saxony crossed the Spanish Merino with the Saxon sheep to develop a dense, fine type of Merino (spinning count between 70s and 80s) adapted to its new environment. From 1778, the Saxon breeding center was operated in the Vorwerk Rennersdorf. It was administered from 1796 by Johann Gottfried Nake, who developed scientific crossing methods to further improve the Saxon Merino. By 1802, the region had four million Saxon Merino sheep, and was becoming the centre for stud Merino breeding, and German wool was considered to be the finest in the world.

In 1802, Colonel David Humphreys, United States Ambassador to Spain, introduced the Vermont strain into North America with an importation of 21 rams and 70 ewes from Portugal and a further importation of 100 Infantado Merinos in 1808. The British embargo on wool and wool clothing exports to the U.S. before the 1812 British/U.S. war led to a &quot;Merino Craze&quot;, with William Jarvis of the Diplomatic Corps importing at least 3,500
sheep between 1809 and 1811 through Portugal.

The Napoleonic Wars (1793–1813) almost destroyed the Spanish Merino industry. The old &quot;cabañas&quot; or flocks were dispersed or slaughtered. From 1810 onwards, the Merino scene shifted to Germany, the United States and Australia. Saxony lifted the export ban on living Merinos after the Napoleonic wars. Highly decorated Saxon sheep breeder Nake from Rennersdorf had established a private sheep farm in Kleindrebnitz in 1811, but ironically after the success of his sheep export to Australia and Russia, failed with his own undertaking.

=== United States Merinos ===

Merino sheep were introduced to Vermont in 1812. This ultimately resulted in a boom-bust cycle for wool, which reached a price of 57 cents/pound in 1835. By 1837, 1,000,000 sheep were in the state. The price of wool dropped to 25 cents/pound in the late 1840s. The state could not withstand more efficient competition from the other states, and sheep-raising in Vermont collapsed. Many sheep farmers from Vermont migrated with their flocks to other parts of the United States.

===Australian Merinos===
====Early history====
About 70 native sheep, suitable only for mutton, survived the journey to Australia with the First Fleet, which arrived in late January 1788. A few months later, the flock had dwindled to just 28 ewes and one lamb.

In 1797, Governor King, Colonel Patterson, Captain Waterhouse and Kent purchased sheep in Cape Town from the widow of Colonel Gordon, commander of the Dutch garrison. When Waterhouse landed in Sydney, he sold his sheep to Captain John MacArthur, Samuel Marsden and Captain William Cox. Although the early origin of the Australian Merino breed involved different stocks from Cape Colony, England, Saxony, France and America and although different Merino strains are bred in Australia, the Australian Merino populations are genetically similar and distinct from all other Merino populations, indicating a common history after they arrived in Australia.

====John and Elizabeth Macarthur====
By 1810, Australia had 33,818 sheep. John MacArthur (who had been sent back from Australia to England following a duel with Colonel Patterson) brought seven rams and one ewe from the first dispersal sale of King George III stud in 1804. The next year, MacArthur and the sheep returned to Australia, Macarthur to reunite with his wife Elizabeth, who had been developing their flock in his absence. Macarthur is considered the father of the Australian Merino industry; in the long term, however, his sheep had very little influence on the development of the Australian Merino.

Macarthur pioneered the introduction of Saxon Merinos with importation from the Electoral flock in 1812. The first Australian wool boom occurred in 1813, when the Great Dividing Range was crossed. During the 1820s, interest in Merino sheep increased. MacArthur showed and sold 39 rams in October 1820, grossing £510/16/5. In 1823, at the first sheep show held in Australia, a gold medal was awarded to W. Riley (&#x27;Raby&#x27;) for importing the most Saxons; W. Riley also imported cashmere goats into Australia. 

====Eliza and John Furlong====
Two of Eliza Furlong&#x27;s (sometimes spelt Forlong or Forlonge) children had died from consumption, and she was determined to protect her surviving two sons by living in a warm climate and finding them outdoor occupations. Her husband John, a Scottish businessman, had noticed wool from the Electorate of Saxony sold for much higher prices than wools from New South Wales. The family decided on sheep farming in Australia for their new business. In 1826, Eliza walked over through villages in Saxony and Prussia, selecting fine Saxon Merino sheep. Her sons, Andrew and William, studied sheep breeding and wool classing. The selected 100 sheep were driven (herded) to Hamburg and shipped to Hull. Thence, Eliza and her two sons walked them to Scotland for shipment to Australia. In Scotland, the new Australia Company, which was established in Britain, bought the first shipment, so Eliza repeated the journey twice more. Each time, she gathered a flock for her sons. The sons were sent to New South Wales, but were persuaded to stop in Tasmania with the sheep, where Eliza and her husband joined them.

&quot;The Age&quot; in 1908 described Eliza Furlong as someone who had &#x27;notably stimulated and largely helped to mould the prosperity of an entire state and her name deserved to live for all time in our history&#x27; (reprinted Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser 27 January 1989).

====John Murray====

There were nearly 2 million sheep in Australia by 1830, and by 1836, Australia had won the wool trade war with Germany, mainly because of Germany&#x27;s preoccupation with fineness. German manufacturers commenced importing Australian wool in 1845. In 1841, at Mount Crawford in South Australia, Murray established a flock of Camden-blood ewes mated to Tasmanian rams. To broaden the wool and give the animals some size, it is thought some English Leicester blood was introduced. The resultant sheep were the foundation of many South Australian strong wool studs. His brother Alexander Borthwick Murray was also a highly successful breeder of Merino sheep.

====The Peppin brothers====

The Peppin brothers took a different approach to producing a hardier, longer-stapled, broader wool sheep. After purchasing Wanganella Station in the Riverina, they selected 200 station-bred ewes that thrived under local conditions and purchased 100 South Australian ewes bred at Cannally that were sired by an imported Rambouillet ram. The Peppin brothers mainly used Saxon and Rambouillet rams, importing four Rambouillet rams in 1860. One of these, Emperor, cut an 11.4 lb (5.1 kg clean) wool clip. They ran some Lincoln ewes, but their introduction into the flock is undocumented. In 1865, George Merriman founded the fine wool Merino Ravensworth Stud, part of which is the Merryville Stud at Yass, New South Wales. His son, Sir Walter Merriman, incorporated Peppin bloodlines into his breeding program.

==== Vermont Merinos in Australia ====
In the 1880s, Vermont rams were imported into Australia from the U.S.; since many Australian stud men believed these sheep would improve wool cuts, their use spread rapidly. Unfortunately, the fleece weight was high, but the clean yield low, the greater grease content increased the risk of fly strike, they had lower uneven wool quality, and lower lambing percentages. Their introduction had a devastating effect on many famous fine-wool studs.

In 1889, while Australian studs were being devastated by the imported Vermont rams, several U.S. Merino breeders formed the Rambouillet Association to prevent the destruction of the Rambouillet line in the U.S. , an estimated 50% of the sheep on the U.S. western ranges are of Rambouillet blood.

The federation drought (1901–1903) reduced the number of Australian sheep from 72 to 53 million and ended the Vermont era. The Peppin and Murray blood strain became dominant in the pastoral and wheat zones of Australia.

====High price records====
The world record price for a ram was A$450,000 for JC&amp;S Lustre 53, which sold at the 1988 Merino ram sale at Adelaide, South Australia. In 2008, an Australian Merino ewe was sold for A$14,000 at the Sheep Show and auction held at Dubbo, New South Wales.

===Events===

The New England Merino Field Days, which display local studs, wool, and sheep, are held during January in even numbered years in and around the Walcha, New South Wales district. The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale, New South Wales in March each year.

===Animal welfare developments===
In Australia, mulesing of Merino sheep is a common practice to reduce the incidence of flystrike. It has been attacked by animal rights and animal welfare activists, with PETA running a campaign against the practice in 2004. The PETA campaign targeted U.S. consumers by using graphic billboards in New York City. PETA threatened U.S. manufacturers with television advertisements showing their companies&#x27; support of mulesing. Fashion retailers including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., Gap Inc and Nordstrom and George (UK) stopped stocking Australian Merino wool products.

New Zealand banned mulesing on 1 October 2018.

==Characteristics==
Merino is an excellent forager and very adaptable. It is bred predominantly for its wool, and its carcass size is generally smaller than that of sheep bred for meat. South African Meat Merino (SAMM), American Rambouillet and German &quot;Merinofleischschaf&quot; have been bred to balance wool production and carcass quality.

Merino has been domesticated and bred in ways that would not allow them to survive well without regular shearing by their owners. They must be shorn at least once a year because their wool does not stop growing. If this is neglected, the overabundance of wool can cause heat stress, mobility issues, and even blindness.

=== Wool qualities ===

Merino wool is fine and soft. Staples are commonly long. A Saxon Merino produces of greasy wool a year, while a good quality Peppin Merino ram produces up to . Merino wool is generally less than 24 micron (μm) in diameter. Basic Merino types include: strong (broad) wool (23 - 24.5 μm), medium wool (21 - 22.9 μm), fine (18.6 - 20.9  μm), superfine (15 – 18.5 μm) and ultra-fine (11.5 - 15 μm).

<text>In Christian theology, synergism refers to the cooperative effort between God and humanity in the process of salvation. Before Augustine of Hippo (354–430), synergism was almost universally endorsed. Later, it came to be reflected in the so-called Semi-Pelagian position and the Semi-Augustinian stance affirmed by the Second Council of Orange (529). Synergism is affirmed by both the Catholic Church, and Eastern Orthodoxy. It is also present in various Protestant denominations, such as Anabaptist churches, and is particularly prominent in those influenced by Arminian theology, such as the Methodist churches.

== Definition ==
Synergism comes from the Greek &quot;syn&quot; (with) and &quot;ergon&quot; (work) and refers to two or more sources working together. In Christian theology, it describes the cooperative effort between God and humanity in the process of salvation. It implies a free human participation in salvation.

== Theology ==
=== Historical developpements ===
Before Augustine (354–430), the synergistic view of salvation was almost universally endorsed. 

Pelagius (c. 354–418), however, argued that humans could perfectly obey God by their own will. The Pelagian view is therefore referred to as &quot;humanistic monergism&quot;. This view was condemned at the Council of Carthage (418) and Ephesus (431).

In response, Augustine proposed a view in which God is the ultimate cause of all human actions, a stance that aligns with soft determinism. The Augustinian view is therefore referred to as &quot;divine monergism&quot;. However, Augustinian soteriology implied double predestination, which was condemned by the Council of Arles (475).

During this period, a moderate form of Pelagianism emerged, later termed Semi-Pelagianism. This view asserted that human will initiates salvation, rather than divine grace. The Semi-Pelagian view is therefore described as &quot;human-initiated synergism&quot;.

In 529, the Second Council of Orange addressed Semi-Pelagianism and declared that even the inception of faith is a result of God’s grace. This highlights the role of prevenient grace enabling human belief. This view, often referred to as &quot;Semi-Augustinian,&quot; is therefore described as &quot;God-initiated synergism&quot;. The Council also rejected predestination to evil.

=== Characterization of the Pelagian-Augustinian salvation framework ===
The Pelagian-Augustinian framework serves as a key paradigm for understanding contemporary forms of synergism. Augustine argued that prevenient grace is necessary to prepare the human will for conversion. He maintained that God predetermined parents to seek baptism for their newborns, linking water baptism to regeneration. Furthermore, he viewed the divine grace that brings about conversion as unfailing. 

The Semi-Augustinian stance builds upon Augustinian thought, also associating regeneration with water baptism. However, it rejects predetermination, allowing space for human decision, particularly in the act of faith. Thus, it maintains that vocation and the gift of faith are divine actions through prevenient grace, while faith itself is a human action, and regeneration remains a divine action. The Semi-Pelagian position holds that vocation and conversion through faith are human actions, while the &quot;increase of faith&quot; bringing regeneration is a divine action. In Pelagianism, humans possess the innate capacity to obey God. Consequently, all steps of salvation are voluntary human actions. 

== Views among Christian denominations ==
=== Denominations traditionally upholding synergism ===
==== Catholic theology ====
Synergism is an important part of the salvation theology of the Catholic Church. Following the Second Council of Orange (529), the Council of Trent (1545–63) reaffirmed the resistibility of prevenient grace and its synergistic nature. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; (1992) teaches that the ability of the human will to respond to divine grace is itself conferred by grace. This synergistic process applies to both justification and sanctification. The sacraments of the Catholic Church such as baptism and the Eucharist, are part of God&#x27;s grace and are thus a vital element in the synergistic process of salvation.

==== Eastern Orthodox theology ====
In Eastern Orthodox theology, God&#x27;s grace and the human response work together in a &quot;cooperation&quot; or &quot;synergy&quot;. This perspective has historically presented less theological tension on this issue compared to the Christian West. In the salvation process, divine grace always precedes any human action. Man possesses libertarian freedom (as implied by the Gnomic will) and must consciously respond to divine grace. This understanding is similar to the Arminian protestant synergism. The Orthodox synergistic process of salvation includes baptism as a response to divine grace. Deification, or &quot;theosis&quot; is also an integral part of this process.

==== Anabaptist theology ====

Anabaptists hold to synergism, teaching that &quot;both God and man play real and necessary parts in the reconciling relationship which binds them.&quot; Anabaptists have a high view of the moral capacities of humans when &quot;enlivened by the active agency of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

==== Arminian theology ====
Christians who adhere to Arminian theology, such as Methodists, believe that salvation is synergistic. Jacobus Arminius first emphasized the role of prevenient grace, which involves a monergistic act of God, followed by &quot;subsequent&quot; act involving a synergistic work. Thus, for Arminians, prevenient grace involves a synergistic process. Similarly, John Wesley held that salvation begins with divine initiative. Additionally, Wesleyan-Arminian theology teaches that both justification and sanctification are synergistic. The Arminian perspective on salvation is often described as &quot;God-initiated synergism&quot;. This perspective aligns closely with the main characteristic of the early Semi-Augustinian thought.

==== Semi-Pelagian view ====
Semi-Pelagianism is present in many current evangelical denominations. It holds that a person can initiate faith independently, without prevenient grace, while its continuation through regeneration depends on God’s grace. This has led to its characterization as &quot;human-initiated synergism&quot;. After the Reformation, Reformed theologians used the term &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; to describe both &quot;Semi-Pelagianism&quot; and &quot;Semi-Augustininianism,&quot; the latter being a divine-initiated synergism.

=== Denominations traditionally upholding monergism ===
==== Lutheran theology ====
Martin Luther (1483-1546) limited monergism strictly to soteriological aspects. He asserted that monergism applied to both election (to salvation) and reprobation. Philip Melanchthon (1497-1560), however, rejected monergism after Luther&#x27;s death in favor of synergism. Melanchthon&#x27;s stance influenced many Lutherans of his time throughout Europe to adopt synergism. The &quot;synergistic controversy&quot; arose when Gnesio-Lutherans, citing Luther&#x27;s monergistic stance, opposed John Pfeffinger&#x27;s synergistic views on the role of human will in conversion.

By 1580, Melanchthon&#x27;s view had lost prominence, and the &quot;Book of Concord&quot; (1580) affirmed soteriological monergism in relation to election (to salvation), but explicitly rejected its application to reprobation. Accordingly, the contemporary Lutheran Church continues to uphold this view. While monergism remains the official stance, Lutheran history includes both monergist and synergist views.

==== Reformed theology ====
In orthodox Reformed theology, divine monergism is understood as operating through an exhaustive divine providence. For example, Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531) viewed that everything, including human salvation and reprobation, was determined by God. In contrast, &quot;libertarian Calvinism&quot;, a revision described by Oliver D. Crisp in his book &quot;Deviant Calvinism&quot; (2014), is a soteriological monergism. Historically, this perspective has remained a minority view within Calvinism.

==== Anglican theology ====
In Anglican Churches there is the historic, Reformed monergistic view of salvation, but some Anglicans adhere to the synergistic view taught by Richard Hooker.

<doc id="524288" wikidata="Q7624161" url="?curid=524288" title="Stripping (printing)">
<text>Within the commercial printing industry, the job of stripping involves arranging and joining film negatives as part of the process of preparing printing plates. In the UK, the same operation is termed &quot;planning&quot; and film positives are used, rather than the negatives in the USA. Because the industry has largely moved to digital processes, the job of stripping, or planning has become rare or even obsolete.

Negatives may be set up in a pattern to allow a printing press to print 4, 8, 16 or 32 pages at a time, front and back, which are then folded to produce a brochure or book with the correct pagination (see figure). Conversely, a variety of smaller printed products of various sizes may be arranged on a single larger press sheet to be cut down after printing into individual job components, such as business or post cards, folding boxes or hang tags.

==Color and density==
For color processes, an individual black and white, &quot;screened&quot; negative is used to represent each color in a four-colour process (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) to be printed on a printing press. A screened negative has varying sizes of dots arranged in a particular pattern to represent greater or lesser density of image. Typically, a 150 dots-per-inch screen is used to create each printing negative, though this will varying depending on the application, where a magazine may use 200 line screens and a newspaper may use 120 to 133 line screen. The screen is rotated at successively varied angles to ensure that the dots do not print exactly on top of one another.

&quot;Cleaning&quot; a negative of unwanted artifacts (noise) from the line camera process, (lines, etc., from the edges of traditional hot-wax analog &quot;font&quot; paste-up, and dirt), would be done by scraping the exposed emulsion from the negative with an X-Acto Knife (for areas intended to be exposed on the printing plate). Similarly, negatives were &quot;opaqued&quot; with an opaquing solution applied with a brush, or felt-tipped pen, or (opaque) red adhesive tape (for larger areas), to prevent exposure of white specs, noise, etc., especially on large fonts.

==Alignment==
Each negative must be precisely aligned and secured by tape to a light-blocking paper or plastic mask. The painstaking alignment of the negatives requires a stripper to use high-magnification eye piece while viewing the work on top of a light table to achieve exact positioning. Once secured, the area of the mask through which light must pass is removed with an Exacto knife or razor blade.

==Exposure and developing==
The completed mask with opened exposure windows is then placed atop a photo-sensitive printing plate, which both plate and mask with stripped negatives fixed by register pins, and then vacuum-sealed in a framed enclosure under glass and exposed to very bright light, allowing the rays to pass through the negatives and expose the printing plate&#x27;s surface. The plate is then developed and the unexposed areas are washed away, leaving behind cured emulsion that will hold the ink on press. A single etched plate is necessary for each color to be printed.

==Diagram==
==Digital prepress==
The process of stripping for general commercial offset printing has largely been eliminated through the use of digital prepress technology, in which imposition software is used to &quot;digitally strip&quot; the pages together. Some printing technologies continue to use stripped film, especially in silk-screen printing, although this is likely to change in the near-term. The digital product of this imposition software can be outputted to an imagesetter that creates a single, composed piece of film, or directly to a platesetter which generates a plate that can go directly to press.

<text>The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (&quot;Forsvarets forskningsinstitutt&quot; – &quot;FFI&quot;) is a research institute that conducts research and development on behalf of the Norwegian Armed Forces and provides expert advice to political and military defence leaders. In particular, its task is to keep track of advances in the fields of science and military technology which might affect the assumptions on which Norwegian security policy and/or defence planning is based.

== History ==
The institute was established in 1946. Its roots lie in Norwegian participation in British scientific research during the Second World War (see Allied technological cooperation during World War II). Many Norwegian scientists and technologists took part during the period when Germany occupied Norway between 1940 and 1945. 

FFI has 714 employees, of which approximately 360 are scientists and engineers. The main location of the institute is at Kjeller near Lillestrøm, 20 km east of the country&#x27;s capital Oslo. The Kjeller area is a hub of research activity in south eastern Norway, with a total of some 2,400 people working at a variety of research establishments, colleges and university departments.

Part of the institute&#x27;s Maritime Systems Division is situated in the coastal city of Horten, southwest of Oslo on the western side of the Oslofjord. Horten is known as the country&#x27;s MEMS capital, and is also a centre of electronics and naval research and industry.

In way of concrete technology products, FFI is known for, among other things:
*The development of a range of computers in the early 1960s which eventually led to the creation of Norsk Data as well as Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk (KV)&#x27;s Computer Division: LYDIA (1962); SAM; SAM2.
*Beginning in 1973, NDRE was an early researcher of TCP/IP in Europe, based on a connection to SATNET through NORSAR, along with Peter Kirstein&#x27;s group at University College London and RSRE in Britain.
*The development, with KV&#x27;s Division of Guided Weapons, of the Penguin anti-ship missile
*The development of the Radar Imager for Mars&#x27; Subsurface Experiment (RIMFAX), an instrument aboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover that is a ground-penetrating radar designed to provide centimeter-scale resolution of the geologic structure of the planet subsurface.

<doc id="524299" wikidata="Q234101" url="?curid=524299" title="Mariel Hemingway">
<text>Mariel Hemingway (born November 22, 1961) is an American actress. She began acting at age 14 with a Golden Globe-nominated breakout role in &quot;Lipstick&quot; (1976), and she received Academy and BAFTA Award nominations for her performance in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979).

She had leading roles in &quot;Personal Best&quot; (1982), &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983), and the TV series &quot;Civil Wars&quot; for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. Hemingway&#x27;s acting career slowed in the late 1990s, and she focused on advocating for mental health awareness. She contributed to the acclaimed documentary &quot;Running from Crazy&quot; regarding her family&#x27;s struggles with mental illness.

==Early life==
She is the daughter of Jack Hemingway and Byra Louise &quot;Puck&quot; Whittlesey. Her paternal grandparents were Ernest Hemingway and Hadley Richardson while Grace Hall Hemingway was her paternal great-grandmother.

Hemingway&#x27;s sisters were Joan &quot;Muffet&quot; and Margot &quot;Margaux&quot;; the latter was a model and actress.

==Career in film==
Hemingway&#x27;s first role was with her real-life sister Margaux (also in her debut role) in the film &quot;Lipstick&quot; (1976), in which they played sisters. She received notice for her acting and was nominated as &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; for the Golden Globe Award that year. Her highest-profile role was in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Manhattan&quot; (1979), a romantic comedy in which she plays Tracy, a high school student and Allen&#x27;s lover. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

In &quot;Personal Best&quot; (1982), she played a bisexual track-and-field athlete in a film noted for its same-sex love scenes. In connection with &quot;Personal Best&quot;, she appeared in a nude pictorial in the April 1982 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; and was on the cover.

She starred as Dorothy Stratten in &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983), a film about the &quot;Playboy&quot; model&#x27;s life and murder. Reports circulated for years that Hemingway had her breasts enlarged to play the role of Stratten, but during a 2007 appearance on the late-night talk and variety show, &quot;Fashionably Late with Stacy London&quot;, she said she had had the surgery before &quot;Star 80&quot;. Her breast implants were removed years later after they had ruptured.

She was featured in &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; (1987) as Lacy Warfield. Subsequently released additional footage showed an expansion of her role. She starred in the 1991–93 legal drama &quot;Civil Wars&quot; for ABC, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe, and co-starred with musician, artist, and film director John Mellencamp in the critically acclaimed 1991 film &quot;Falling from Grace&quot;. She was cast as the female lead in Darren Star&#x27;s CBS drama &quot;Central Park West&quot; for the 1995–96 season; however, the show fared poorly with both critics and viewers, and after 13 episodes Hemingway was told that the show wanted her to accept a deep pay cut and demotion to recurring character status. She quit the series, which only lasted eight more episodes before being cancelled. In 1996, she had a leading role in the British TV movie &quot;September&quot;, playing the wife of Michael York.

She has played a lesbian or bisexual woman in several films and television shows, including &quot;Personal Best&quot;, &quot;The Sex Monster&quot;, &quot;In Her Line of Fire&quot;, and episodes of the TV series &quot;Roseanne&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; and &quot;December Bride&quot;) and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;. Hemingway is heterosexual, but has said she formed a &quot;big connection with the LGBT community&quot; after &quot;Personal Best&quot; and enjoys taking roles in &quot;cutting-edge&quot; productions.

Hemingway has starred in and co-produced videos about yoga and holistic living. In 2002, she published a yoga memoir, &quot;Finding My Balance&quot;. She is currently the host of &quot;Spiritual Cinema&quot;, a monthly television show dedicated to spiritual films. She has begun hosting a series of yoga practice videos known as &quot;Yoga Now&quot;, with guru Rodney Yee.

Hemingway worked on the documentary film &quot;Running from Crazy&quot;, directed by Barbara Kopple and produced by the Oprah Winfrey Network chronicling the Hemingway family&#x27;s history of suicide, substance abuse and mental illness, shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2013. In October that year, Hemingway received a humanitarian award from the San Diego Film Festival for her role in the documentary. Her memoir, &quot;Out Came the Sun&quot;, was released in 2015.

==Personal life==
Hemingway married Stephen Crisman in 1984. They have two daughters: Dree Hemingway and Langley Fox. They separated in 2008 and divorced the following year.

In 1996, her sister Margaux died of a barbiturate overdose at age 42. She was the fifth to commit suicide in four generations of Hemingways and her family had difficulty accepting the fact of her suicide.

In 2010, Hemingway wrote the foreword to yoga teacher Mark Stephens&#x27; book &quot;Teaching Yoga&quot;, describing Stephens as a significant inspiration and teacher&#x27;s teacher.

In early 2011, Hemingway began a relationship with former stuntman Bobby Williams with whom she has co-authored a self-help book.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo4/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She practices Transcendental Meditation.

In the 2013 television documentary &quot;Running from Crazy&quot;, Hemingway talked of her bouts of mental illness and her still lingering issues with her siblings. She spoke of her family&#x27;s struggles with alcoholism, mental illnesses, and suicide. In particular, she mentioned how her sister Margaux&#x27;s suicide continued to haunt her. She also claimed that her parents&#x27; marriage was abusive and unhappy and discussed abusive incidents in her childhood.

In her memoir, &quot;Out Came the Sun&quot; (2015), Hemingway discussed being hit on by older men in Hollywood, including Bob Fosse, Robert De Niro, and Robert Towne. Woody Allen invited her on a trip to Paris, but she realized that he did not intend them to have separate rooms. Though she declined his advances, she states she continued to &quot;love him as a friend&quot; and was grateful that they stayed in touch in later years.

<text>The Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge, also known as the Alexandra Bridge or Interprovincial Bridge, is a steel truss cantilever bridge spanning the Ottawa River between Ottawa, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec. In addition to carrying vehicle traffic, a shared use pathway on the bridge for pedestrians and cyclists is maintained by the National Capital Commission.

The bridge was designated by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering a National Historic Civil Engineering Site in June 1995. It was owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway until it was taken over by the National Capital Commission in 1970. It is now owned by the Government of Canada and maintained by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC).

In 2019, the Canadian government directed that the bridge was to be replaced by the year 2029. The bridge was closed for vehicles from October 2023 till February 2025 as essential rehabilitation and repair work was being completed.

==History==

The bridge was constructed by the Canadian Pacific Railway between 1898 and 1900. Four barges were built to move steel beams into position. During the winter (1899–1900) workmen toiled day and night chopping channels to keep the ice clear for the barges to pass so that work could continue on the superstructure. Considerable construction delays were caused by the severe winter conditions. By September 1900 the four fixed support spans were complete. The Canadian Society of Civil Engineers held its annual meeting in Ottawa in order that its members might tour the bridge works and see the preparations being made for placing the centre span. The bridge&#x27;s main cantilever centre span was, at the time of construction, the longest in Canada and the fourth-longest in the world. Both records are now held by the Quebec Bridge. The centre span was successfully put in place on October 7, and a locomotive made a trial run on December 12, 1900. On February 18, 1901, the bridge was officially inaugurated as the Interprovincial Bridge as it had been built by the Ottawa Interprovincial Bridge Company. The name was changed in September 1901 to the &quot;Royal Alexandra Bridge&quot; in honour of the new Queen during the visit of her son, the Duke of Cornwall and York, later George V.

The Royal Alexandra Interprovincial Bridge crosses the Ottawa River just east of Parliament Hill at Nepean Point in Ottawa. The bridge was designed primarily to carry CPR trains but also had a track for local electric trolley service between Ottawa and Hull, as well as a lane for carriage traffic. A large fire severely damaged the bridge in 1946, permanently terminating trolley traffic.

During the late 1950s the bridge was upgraded to carry vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The closure of Ottawa Union Station in 1966 saw the last passenger trains use the Royal Alexandra Bridge and the railway tracks were removed as the bridge became exclusively a vehicular-pedestrian bridge.

On August 21, 1989, the bridge was the site of a noted murder. Alain Brosseau, a waiter at the Château Laurier, was walking home to his apartment in Hull after finishing his shift at 11:30 pm. On his way he passed through Major&#x27;s Hill Park. The park was known as a popular gay cruising area, and six youths were also in the park searching for homosexuals to rob and attack. They saw Brosseau and followed him when he walked to the bridge, believing incorrectly that he was gay. A short way across Brosseau was first hit with a stick and then robbed. Gang member Jeffrey Lalonde then lifted Brosseau and threw him off the bridge. Brosseau was killed instantly when he hit the rocks below. Lalonde was given a life sentence, and died in jail in 2008.

The bridge is designated by the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering a National Historic Civil Engineering Site in June 1895. It was owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway until it was taken over by the National Capital Commission in 1970. It is now (2018) owned by the Government of Canada and maintained by Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC).

==Current use==

The bridge provided an important commuter link between Ottawa and Gatineau. The roadways for vehicles are located on the centre and east decks. Centre deck road surface is paved while the east deck is a metal steel grating.

The west deck provides a panorama of the Ottawa-Gatineau skyline, the Ottawa River and Parliament Buildings. That deck is used by rollerbladers, cyclists, and pedestrians, and is on the official route of the Trans Canada Trail. The bike lane of the bridge links to two major cross-town bike paths. In Gatineau, there is the Voyageur Pathway that links the Aylmer and Gatineau sectors, while in Ottawa there is the Ottawa River Pathway&#x27;s western section that links downtown to Carling Avenue. A third pathway, De l&#x27;Île, travels through the Old Hull section beside Boulevard des Allumettières (formerly called Boulevard Saint-Laurent), the road that continues after the bridge on the Gatineau side making a single stretch of road from Eardley Road to the former CFB Rockcliffe.

At both ends of the bridge are two major museums. In the Gatineau side of the river is the Canadian Museum of History while on the Ottawa side is the National Art Gallery while the Canadian Mint Museum and the former Canadian War Museum was located beside the Gallery. Also, on each end of the bridge are two major parks: Major&#x27;s Hill Park (Ottawa) and Jacques Cartier Park (Gatineau) two major venues of the Canadian Tulip Festival and the Canada Day festivities.

The bridge used to carry roughly 15,000 vehicles, 2000 pedestrians and 1300 cyclists each day, as of 2009. A two-year rehabilitation project which began in 2009, included various structural improvements and replacements of the centre concrete deck, the wood boardwalk and guardrails.

Nepean Point overlooks the bridge from the Ottawa side. The Rideau Canal meets the Ottawa River immediately upriver of the bridge&#x27;s Ottawa abutment.

In 2018 a cost analysis determined that replacing the bridge would be less disruptive and less expensive than maintaining it. The following year, the Canadian government directed the bridge to be replaced by the year 2029. As planning got underway, the bridge continued to be maintained for use by vehicle and pedestrian traffic. In October 2023, following an assessment that found severe deterioration due to corrosion of the steel structure, the bridge was closed to vehicle traffic. The closure was expected to end in fall of 2024 but was extended to February, 2025. The bridge reopened to vehicle traffic on February 25, 2025.

The bridge replacement project is still in the planning phase, with several designs having been submitted and ongoing environmental and cultural impact assessments taking place and construction is expected to begin before 2032.

<doc id="524302" wikidata="Q1515974" url="?curid=524302" title="River Aln">
<text>The River Aln () runs through the county of Northumberland in England. It rises in Alnham in the Cheviot Hills and discharges into the North Sea at Alnmouth on the east coast of England.

The river gives its name to the town of Alnwick and the villages of Alnmouth and Alnham. For part of its route, directly upstream of Alnwick, the river flows through Hulne Park.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name &quot;Aln&quot; is uncertain, but it is generally seen as a river-name of the &quot;Alaunos&quot; or &quot;Alaunā&quot;. Names of this type could derive from the Celtic root *&quot;al&quot;- (&#x27;feed, raise, nurture&#x27;) or *&quot;alǝ&quot;- (to wander&#x27;), or else from the Brittonic element &quot;*al-&quot;, &quot;shining, bright&quot; (Welsh &quot;alaw&quot;, &#x27;waterlilly&#x27;). Another suggestion is that the name is derived from the Brittonic root &quot;*Alaun-&quot; (‘holy one’ or ‘mighty one’).

==History==
The Aln is first mentioned in the Geography of Ptolemy, a 2nd Century AD Roman cartographer. He refers to it as the River Alaunos or Alaunus (Geographica 2.3.4.18), on which seems to be situated the town of Alauna (Geographica 2.3.7.6). This can speculatively be identified as the Roman fort at Learchild, where the Devil&#x27;s Causeway crosses the river.

The Aln is a relatively small river but has been important through history as one of the boundaries along which English and Scottish troops marching to war had to cross; for that reason, it was at times heavily defended. For example, the river flows past Learchild Roman Fort and, more significantly, Alnwick Castle which was built for this purpose.

In two battles at Alnwick the river was a significant element: the first in 1093 between Malcolm III of Scotland and Robert de Mowbray; the second in 1174 between William I of Scotland and Ranulf de Glanville.

Adtwifyrdi is the name used by the Venerable Bede to describe the meeting of river and tributary at the mouth of the River Aln.

==Non-tidal ecology==
The river has a good run of sea trout and salmon, as well as a population of resident brown trout. Public fishing is controlled by the Aln Anglers&#x27; Association. The Aln also has a resident population of otters. Grey heron, barn owls, kestrels and buzzards can be observed hunting along the banks of the river.

==Tidal ecology==
Part of the estuary is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the river below Lesbury footbridge (the normal tidal limit, except on high springs and in surge events) was made a marine conservation zone in 2013. Large groups of lapwings, oystercatchers and curlews can often be seen. In smaller numbers are mallards, shelducks, grey herons, cormorants, greylag geese, Canada geese, mute swans and the occasional family of goosanders. Less often spotted are barn owls, kestrels, avocets and little egrets. Further down the tidal zone a visitor will often see Sandwich terns and common terns, as well as a variety of gulls and smaller waders including redshanks, greenshanks, turnstones, ringed plovers, pied wagtails, and other sandpipers.

<text>The XXXIII Corps, or the Trishakti Corps, is a corps of the Indian Army. It draws some of its heritage from the British Indian XXXIII Corps which was formed in 1942, but disbanded in 1945. It was re-raised in 1960 at Shillong.

The corps is headquartered in Sukna in North Bengal and is commanded by a Three Star officer of the rank of Lieutenant General titled General Officer Commanding (GOC). His chief of staff is a Two Star officer of the rank of Major General. The total troop strength of the XXXIII corps is estimated to be between 45,000 and 60,000 soldiers.

==History==
The XXXIII Corps Operating Signal Regiment was a part of XIV Army during World War II. The regiment moved to its present location along with the Corps HQ in 1962. It participated in the Indo-China war of 1962 and captured some Chinese communication equipment. These equipment are kept in Corps of Signals Museum at Jabalpur to enable the future generations of soldiers know about the bravery and dedication shown by their predecessors.

==Re-Raising==
The corps was re-raised by Lieutenant General Umrao Singh on 1 November 1960, to reduce IV Corps&#x27; area of responsibility. The Corps is headquartered in Sukna in North Bengal, near the city of Siliguri. Its area of responsibility includes North Bengal, Sikkim and if needed, Bhutan. It comprises three mountain divisions, 17th (Gangtok), 20th (Binnaguri), and 27th (Kalimpong). 
The coat of arms consists of a white horizontal band between two red bands (the standard formation sign background for corps in the Indian Army) with a black trident and a black spear with black wings in the foreground. The Corps HQ has an Indian Air Force air control unit attached to it, 3 TAC, commanded by a Group Captain. The corps also has an organic Army Aviation Helicopter Squadron based at Sevoke flying the HAL Chetak. It is commanded by a Colonel. The Indian Air Force bases at Bagdogra (Siliguri) and Hashimara are the air units co-tasked to the XXXIII Corps Area of Responsibility.

==ORBAT==
It currently consists of:

*17th Mountain Division (Blackcat Division) headquartered at Gangtok. 
**It was raised in 1959 and converted to a mountain division in 1963. 
**It is assigned to the Sikkim sector.
*20th Mountain Division (Kirpan Division) headquartered at Binnaguri.
**It was raised in 1963 and assigned to the Sikkim sector. 
**Composed of 66, 165, and 202 Mountain Brigades in 1971.
*27th Mountain Division (Striking Lion Division) headquartered at Kalimpong. 
**It was converted to a mountain division in 1963. 
*Division Artillery Brigade
*MR-SAM (Abhra) Regiment (raised in February 2023)

==Indo-Pakistani War of 1971==
The corps handled the sensitive Indo-Tibetan border and was responsible for the defence of the McMahon Line. The corps under Lieutenant General Mohan L. Thapan controlled 6 and 20 Mountain Divisions and 71 Mountain Brigade. While fighting the war to the south, however, the corps also had to look north and retained command of 17 and 27 Mountain Divisions on the Tibetan frontier. Furthermore, Thapan could not commit 6 Mountain Division without permission from New Delhi as it was to be held ready to move to the Bhutanese border in case China intervened in the war.

As elsewhere along the border, Indian forces in support of the Mukti Bahini made significant
in roads into East Pakistan prior to 3 December. Most notable was Brigadier Pran Nath Kathpalia’s 71 Mountain Brigade, which had pushed to the outskirts of Thakurgaon by the eve of war. Efforts to capture the heavily fortified border village of Hilli, however, failed repeatedly in a struggle that raged off and on from 24 November to 11 December. Resolutely defended by Pakistani 4 Frontier Force, Hilli blocked the proposed advance of 20 Division across the narrow “waist” of this sector.

After heavy losses in front of Hilli, the 20 division solved this problem by swinging around to the north and unleashing 340 Brigade under Brigadier Joginder Singh Bakshi. Bakshi moved swiftly to control the main north-south road, unhinging the defense of Hilli, splitting Pakistani 16 Division, and opening the way to Bogra, which town he effectively controlled by war’s end. The Pakistani division, despite continued resistance by isolated units, had ceased to exist as a coherent combat formation. Indicative of the chaotic situation, General Shah and the commander of 205 Brigade, Brigadier Tajammul Hussain Malik, were almost captured when Indian forces ambushed their convoy on 7 December. On the other hand, a last-minute Indian moves north by 66 and 202 Brigades to capture Rangpur proved unsuccessful.

In secondary actions, 9 Mountain Brigade secured most of the area north of the Tista River and an ad hoc command of Indian BSF and Mukti Bahini under Brigadier Prem Singh pushed out of Malda to capture Nawabganj in the extreme southeastern corner of the sector. Despite Bakshi’s performance and the generally successful advance of 71 Brigade, much of XXXIII Corps’ offensive power was allowed to lie idle far too long and Pakistani troops still held the major towns of the sector (Rangpur, Saidpur, Dinajpur, Nator, Rajshahi) when the cease-fire was announced. Likewise, the cease-fire intervened before the Indians could implement a hastily conceived plan to transfer 340 Brigade, a tank squadron, and an artillery battery across the Jamuna via the Phulchari ferry to take part in the advance on Dacca. With the exception of this squadron, all the armour was preparing to transfer to the west by the end of the war.

<doc id="524306" wikidata="Q318431" url="?curid=524306" title="Ian Rankin">
<text>Sir Ian James Rankin (born 28 April 1960) is a Scottish crime writer and philanthropist, best known for his Inspector Rebus novels.

==Early life==
Rankin was born in Cardenden, Fife. His father, James, owned a grocery shop, and his mother, Isobel, worked in a school canteen. He was educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. His parents were horrified when he then chose to study literature at university, as they had expected him to study for a trade. Encouraged by his English teacher, he persisted and graduated in 1982 from the University of Edinburgh, where he also worked on a doctorate on Muriel Spark but did not complete it. He has taught at the university and retains an involvement with the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. He lived in Tottenham, London, for four years and then rural France for six while he developed his career as a novelist. Before becoming a full-time novelist, he worked as a grape picker, swineherd, taxman, alcohol researcher, hi-fi journalist, college secretary and punk musician in a band called the Dancing Pigs.

==Career==
Rankin did not set out to be a crime writer. He thought his first novels, &quot;Knots and Crosses&quot; and &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, were mainstream books, more in keeping with the Scottish traditions of Robert Louis Stevenson and even Muriel Spark. He was disconcerted by their classification as genre fiction. The Scottish novelist Allan Massie, who tutored Rankin while Massie was writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh, reassured him by saying, &quot;Do you think John Buchan ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?&quot;

Rankin&#x27;s Inspector Rebus novels are set mainly in Edinburgh. They are considered major contributions to the tartan noir genre. Thirteen of the novels—plus one short story—were adapted as a television series on ITV, starring John Hannah as Rebus in series 1 and 2 (4 episodes) and Ken Stott in that role in series 3–5 (10 episodes).

In 2009, Rankin donated the short story &quot;Fieldwork&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Rankin&#x27;s story was published in the &quot;Earth&quot; collection.

In 2009 Rankin stated on BBC Radio 5 Live that he would start work on a five- or six-issue run on the comic book &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, although he may turn the story into a stand-alone graphic novel instead. The Vertigo Comics panel at WonderCon 2009 confirmed that the story would be published as a graphic novel, &quot;Dark Entries&quot;, the second release from the company&#x27;s Vertigo Crime imprint.

In 2013, Rankin co-wrote the play &quot;Dark Road&quot; with Mark Thomson, the artistic director of the Royal Lyceum Theatre. The play, which marked Rankin&#x27;s play-writing debut, premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, in September 2013.

In 2005, Rankin became the tenth best-selling writer in Britain, accounting for 10% of all crime fiction sold. He also wrote three non-Rebus crime novels in 1993-95 under the pseudonym Jack Harvey.

In 2021, Rankin helped finish a draft by William McIlvanney, a prequel telling the story of an early case of McIlvanney&#x27;s fictional detective Jack Laidlaw. McIlvanney, whom Rankin admires, had died in 2015 leaving the manuscript unfinished. It was published under the name &quot;The Dark Remains&quot;.

In 2022, Rankin signed a deal with publisher Orion to write two new John Rebus novels. Later that same year, he received a Knighthood from HM Queen Elizabeth II for services to literature and charity as part of her Birthday Honours List.

==Documentaries==
Rankin is a regular contributor to the BBC Two arts programme &quot;Newsnight Review&quot;. His three-part documentary series on the subject of evil was broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2002. In 2005 he presented a 30-minute documentary on BBC Four called &quot;Rankin on the Staircase&quot;, in which he investigated the relationship between real-life cases and crime fiction. It was loosely based on the Michael Peterson murder case, as covered in Jean-Xavier Lestrade&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Death on the Staircase&quot;. The same year, Rankin collaborated with folk musician Jackie Leven on the album &quot;Jackie Leven Said&quot;.

In 2007, Rankin appeared in programmes for BBC Four exploring the origins of his alter-ego character, John Rebus. In these, titled &quot;Ian Rankin&#x27;s Hidden Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Ian Rankin Investigates Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,&quot; Rankin looks at the origins of the character and the events that led to his creation.

In the TV show &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, he takes a trip through Edinburgh with writer/cook Anthony Bourdain.

He appeared in &quot;The Amber Light&quot;, a 2019 documentary film about Scotch whisky.

== Music ==
Rankin is the singer in the six-piece band Best Picture, formed by journalists Kenny Farquharson (&quot;The Times&quot;) and Euan McColl (&quot;The Scotsman&quot;) in 2017, and featuring Bobby Bluebell on guitar. They released the single &quot;Isabelle&quot; on Oriel Records in October 2017. They made their live debut at the Kendal Calling music festival on 28 July 2018.

==Personal life==
He lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Miranda (&quot;née&quot; Harvey), whom he met at university and married in 1986, and their two sons: John Morgan &quot;Jack&quot; Harvey-Rankin (born 1992) and Christopher Connor &quot;Kit&quot; Harvey-Rankin (born 1994). He has acknowledged the assistance they get from &quot;Forward Vision&quot; in Edinburgh in looking after Kit and other young adults with special needs. They lived for a number of years in the Merchiston/Morningside area, near the authors J. K. Rowling, Alexander McCall Smith and Kate Atkinson, before moving to a penthouse flat in the former Edinburgh Royal Infirmary building in Quartermile in Lauriston. The couple also own a house in Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands. Rankin appears as a character in McCall Smith&#x27;s 2004 novel, &quot;44 Scotland Street&quot;.

In 2011, a group of ten book sculptures were deposited around Edinburgh as gifts to cultural institutions and the people of the city. Many of the sculptures made reference to the work of Rankin, and an eleventh sculpture was a personal gift to him.

In 2019, Rankin donated his personal archives to the National Library of Scotland after moving to his flat in the Quartermile. The Library planned an exhibition for 2021 of highlights from the archive, which includes research notes, newspaper clippings and manuscripts.

Rankin has donated a considerable portion of his earnings to charity. In 2007, he and his wife set up a trust to support charities in the fields of health, art and education. In 2020, it was reported that he had donated around £1 million to the trust in the previous five years, with £200,000 being donated in 2019. In 2022, he donated rare first editions of three of his early works, valued at a total of £1,850, to a book sale in aid of Christian Aid.

A Stadia version developed by 11-bit studios in partnership with Crunching Koalas was released on July 1, 2021. A DLC expansion, subtitled &quot;Between Dimensions&quot;, was released on July 23, 2019.

A sequel, titled &quot;Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault&quot;, is scheduled to be released in 2025.

== Plot ==
=== Setting ===
Moonlighter is set in the village of &quot;Rynoka&quot;, which was created when several mysterious door were found to lead to unique places filled with artifacts. The people has started calling these places &quot;Dungeon&quot; and started venturing into them to gather resources to sell. There are 2 type of people who explore these dungeons, heroes who explore the dungeons and kill monsters for fame and glory, and merchants, people who explore the dungeons in search for artifacts within chests to sell. Heroes are held in greater esteem than merchants as merchants are seen as people who only care about money.

Each dungeon contains a mini boss at each floor, along with a dungeon guardian at the final level. When the dungeons were first discovered, Rynoka was filled with travelers and warriors looking to explore these places, and was very prosperous in the beginning. However, as the casualty rate within the dungeon became too high, the town started closing down the dungeons in order to protect the citizens. This would lead to Rynoka decline because they rely on the artifacts collected from the dungeons. As of now, only 1 dungeon remains open for people to explore.

=== Story ===
Will, a 17 year old orphan, has begun exploring the dungeons near his house in order to collect artifacts to sell at his family shop, the Moonlighter. While exploring the first dungeon, he discovered a body which contained a note from Crazy Pete, a friend of his grandfather who used to research the dungeons. The note states that each of the 4 dungeon contains a guardian, which has a key on them. These keys are needed to open the 5th dungeon, which has remained closed since the dungeons were discovered. 

However, Will was advised against trying to find these keys as he is a merchant, not a hero. Despite the warnings, Will managed to defeat each of the 4 dungeons guardians and collecting the keys they had on them. He eventually became known as the hero-merchant and more travelers has started visiting Rynoka again. After collecting all 4 keys, the door to the 5th dungeon finally opened.

As Will started to explore the 5th dungeon, he discovered it was filled with bodies of an alien species, and found some notes with the dungeon. The 5th dungeon was actually the base of a group of interdimensional pirates. These pirates were able to achieve interdimensional travel faster than any other civilization, and has started raiding other dimensions for their resources. The other dungeons were actually doorways to other dimensions the pirates created to streamline looting resources from other dimensions. When they discovered that a governmental group called the ICT was closing in on them, they decided to hide within their base to mask their base signal, giving the keys to a minion. The minion was to open the base within 1 month to resume their raiding. However, the minion was discovered and attacked by Crazy Pete, killing both the minion and Crazy Pete, causing the pirates to remain trapped. This led to the pirates fighting over what little resources. They decided to crash their base into a random dimension in a bid to try to escape, resulting in the dungeons appearance. However, only 1 member of the pirates remain as a result, the captain.

When Will discovered the pirate captain, the pirate captain thanks Will for freeing him and offered him the chance to leave, after stating his desire to continue his plans of pillaging other dimensions. However, Will refused and fought the pirate captain, eventually defeating him. Outside the dungeons, several soldiers from the ICT has begun to arrive to the dungeons, and closed them off. Opening the 5th dungeon has reactivated the base signal, allowing them to hone in and attempt to capture the pirates. When Will exit the dungeon, he explained to the ICT captain about what happened to the pirates. The ICT captain then informed Will that he&#x27;s supposed to arrest everyone on the planet for using the doors to raid other dimensions, but because of Will&#x27;s action in stopping the pirates and their contact with other dimension cultures, they decided to invite the planet to take part in the Dimensional Commerce Treaty, which allows them to legally trade with other dimensions. They will shut down the dungeons and that the continued use of them will illegal. Afterwards, Will returns to Rynoka to inform the town about the news.

<text>Moonlighting is an American comedy drama television series that aired on ABC from March 3, 1985, to May 14, 1989. The network aired a total of 67 episodes. Starring Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis as private detectives, Allyce Beasley as their quirky receptionist, and Curtis Armstrong as a temporary worker (and later junior detective), the show was a mixture of drama, comedy, mystery, and romance, and was considered to be one of the first successful and influential examples of comedy drama, or &quot;dramedy&quot;, emerging as a distinct television genre.
The show&#x27;s theme song was co-written and performed by jazz singer Al Jarreau and became a hit. The show is also credited with making Willis a star and relaunching Shepherd&#x27;s career after a string of lackluster projects. In 1997, the episode &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot; was ranked number 34 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2007, the series was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best TV Shows of All-&quot;Time&quot;. The relationship between the characters David and Maddie was included in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of the best TV couples of all time.

==Plot==
The series revolved around cases investigated by the Blue Moon Detective Agency and its two partners, Madelyn &quot;Maddie&quot; Hayes (Shepherd) and David Addison (Willis). The show, with a mix of mystery, sharp dialogue, and sexual tension between its leads, introduced Willis to the world and brought Shepherd back into the spotlight after a nearly decade-long absence. The characters were introduced in a two-hour pilot episode.

The show&#x27;s storyline begins with the reversal of fortune of Maddie Hayes, a former model who finds herself bankrupt after her accountant steals all her liquid assets. She is left with several failing businesses formerly maintained as tax writeoffs, one of which is the City of Angels Detective Agency, helmed by the carefree David Addison. Between the pilot and the first one-hour episode, David persuades Maddie to keep the business and run it as a partnership. The agency is renamed Blue Moon Investigations because Maddie was most famous for being the spokesmodel for the Blue Moon Shampoo Company. In many episodes, she was recognized as &quot;the Blue Moon shampoo girl&quot;, if not by name.

In his audio commentary for the season-three DVD, creator Glenn Gordon Caron says that the inspiration for the series was a production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; he saw in Central Park starring Meryl Streep and Raúl Julia. The show parodied the play in the season-three episode &quot;Atomic Shakespeare&quot;.

==Cast==
===Main cast===
*Cybill Shepherd, as Madelyn &quot;Maddie&quot; Hayes, is a chic, smart former high-fashion model. Left bankrupt when her accountant embezzles her money, she is forced to make a living by running the detective agency she owns as a tax writeoff. Using her celebrity as a former model, she brings in clients and tries to bring some order to a business previously run without any discipline. By the time he had written 50 pages for the pilot to the show, Caron says he realized he was writing the part for Shepherd. After reading the script, she immediately realized this was a part she wanted to do, and during her first meeting with Caron and producer Jay Daniel, remarked that it was reminiscent of a &quot;Hawksian&quot; comedy. The two had no idea what she was talking about, so she suggested they screen &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, and &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, three of her favorites, to see how the overlapping dialogue was handled. A week before shooting of the pilot began, Caron, Shepherd, and Willis watched &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot; and &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;.
*Bruce Willis, as David Addison, is a wisecracking detective running the City of Angels Detective Agency. Faced with the prospect of being put out of business, he convinces Maddie that they lost money only because they were supposed to and talks her into rebranding the agency and going into business with him as her partner. Caron had to fight with ABC to put Willis in the lead role, having already signed Shepherd for the pilot and series. Caron claims he tested Willis about a third of the way through over 2,000 actors, knew &quot;this was the guy&quot; immediately, and had to fight through twice as many more acting tests and readings, while arguing with ABC executives before receiving conditional authorization to cast Willis in the pilot. According to Caron, ABC did not feel that viewers would find any sexual tension between Shepherd and Willis believable.
*Allyce Beasley, as Agnes DiPesto, is the agency&#x27;s extremely loyal and quirky receptionist, who always answers the phone in rhyme. As problems arose with getting Willis and Shepherd on screen due to personal issues, the writers started to focus on the relationship between Agnes and fellow Blue Moon employee Herbert Viola. In the series finale, Agnes marries Herbert and berates Maddie and David for not being able to figure out their relationship as the entire set is dismantled, and says, &quot;if there&#x27;s a God in heaven, he&#x27;ll spin Herbert and me off in our own series.&quot;
*Curtis Armstrong, as Herbert Viola, started at Blue Moon as an employee from a temporary help agency. The producers brought Armstrong in based on his work in &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, hoping to expand the role of DiPesto by giving her a love interest, thereby taking some of the pressure off Willis and Shepherd. As Herbert begins to shine in his duties, he gets promoted to junior detective and marries Agnes in the series finale. Debuting in season three, he appeared in 36 of the series&#x27; 67 episodes.

==Episodes==

==Format innovations==

The series was created by Glenn Gordon Caron, one of the producers of the similar &quot;Remington Steele&quot;, when he was approached by ABC executive Lewis H. Erlicht. Erlicht liked the work Caron had done on &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele&quot; and wanted a detective show featuring a major star in a leading role who would appeal to an upscale audience. Caron wanted to do a romance, to which Erlicht replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what it is, as long as it&#x27;s a detective show.&quot;

The tone of the series was left up to the production staff, resulting in &quot;Moonlighting&quot; becoming one of the first successful TV &quot;dramedies&quot;— dramatic-comedy, a style of television and movies in which an equal or nearly equal balance of humor and serious content is used. The show made use of fast-paced, overlapping dialogue between the two leads, harking back to classic screwball comedy films such as those of director Howard Hawks. These innovative qualities resulted in its being nominated, for the first time in the 50-year history of the Directors Guild of America, for both Best Drama and Best Comedy in the same year (both in 1985 and 1986).

===Breaking the fourth wall===

&quot;Moonlighting&quot; frequently broke the fourth wall, with many episodes including dialogue that made direct references to the scriptwriters, the audience, the network, or the series itself. (For example, when a woman is trying to commit suicide by jumping into a bathtub with a television playing &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, Addison says, &quot;The Stooges? Are you nuts? The network&#x27;ll never let you do that, lady!&quot;)

Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show&#x27;s production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation as a way to fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers needed something to fill the entire hour. In some episodes, the production crew and sets became involved in the plot; in the final episode of the series, &quot;Lunar Eclipse&quot;, Hayes and Addison find out that the show is being canceled, and the office set is dismantled around them as they argue with a producer.

===Fantasy===
The series also embraced fantasy; in season two, the show aired &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot;, an episode that featured two lengthy and elaborately produced black-and-white dream sequences. David and Maddie are told about a murder that occurred in the 1940s by the inheritor of the then-famous nightclub where the murder took place. Maddie and David feud over whether the man or woman who was executed for the crime was the real murderer. The two dream sequences present each detective&#x27;s version of how the murder took place. They were filmed on black-and-white film stock so they would look like true period films. (The commentary on the DVD mentions that they used black-and-white film instead of color so that the network would not later use the color film.)

Fearing fan reaction to a popular show being shown in black and white, ABC demanded a disclaimer be made at the beginning of the episode to inform viewers of the &quot;black-and-white&quot; gimmick for the episode. The show&#x27;s producers hired Orson Welles to deliver the introduction, which aired a few days after the actor&#x27;s death.

&quot;Atomic Shakespeare&quot; features the cast performing a variation of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, with David in the role of Petruchio, Maddie as Katharina, Agnes as Bianca, and Herbert as Lucentio. The episode features Shakespearean costumes and mixed the plot with humorous anachronisms and variations on &quot;Moonlighting&quot;&#x27;s own running gags. The characters perform the dialogue in (mostly) iambic pentameter, and the episode is wrapped by segments featuring a boy imagining the episode&#x27;s proceedings because his mother forced him to do his Shakespeare homework instead of watching &quot;Moonlighting&quot;.

===Other===
In addition, the show mocked its connection to the &quot;Remington Steele&quot; series by having Pierce Brosnan hop networks and make a cameo appearance as Steele in one episode. The show also acknowledged &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; as an influence: in the episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Job&quot;, based on the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, Maddie&#x27;s guardian angel showed her an alternate reality in which Jonathan and Jennifer Hart from the earlier series had taken over Blue Moon&#x27;s lease. Although Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers did not appear in the episode, Lionel Stander reprised his role as the Harts&#x27; assistant Max.

Both Shepherd and Willis sang musical numbers over the course of the show. In &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot;, Shepherd performed both &quot;Blue Moon&quot; in Maddie&#x27;s dream sequence and &quot;I Told Ya I Love Ya, Now Get Out&quot; in David&#x27;s, while in &quot;Atomic Shakespeare&quot;, Willis sings The Young Rascals&#x27; &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;. Willis also frequently broke into shorter snippets of Motown songs. &quot;Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, and &quot;I Told Ya I Love Ya...&quot; appeared on the Moonlighting Soundtrack.

The episode &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; centers around a production dance number set to the Billy Joel song of the same name. The sequence was directed by musical director Stanley Donen.

==Production==
&quot;Moonlighting&quot; was unusual at the time for being one of only three shows, due to FCC regulations limiting the practice, to be owned and produced in-house by a broadcast network (NBC&#x27;s &quot;Punky Brewster&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; revival being the others). This allowed the network greater flexibility in budgeting the show, since the &quot;back-end potential&quot; for profits was so much greater with not having to pay a licensing fee to the film studio or independent production company. As a result, ABC gave Caron significant control over production. Caron, however, was a perfectionist and viewed &quot;Moonlighting&quot; as the filming of a one-hour movie every week, using techniques usually reserved for big-budget films. To capture the cinematic feel of the films of the 1940s, for example, he would prohibit the use of a zoom lens, opting instead to use more time-consuming master cameras that move back and forth on a track and require constant resetting of the lights. Diffusion disks were used to soften Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s features, and a special lens needed to be employed so that in a two shot, Maddie would be diffused and David would not.

Much of the credit for this look and feel can be attributed to the hiring of Gerald Finnerman as the director of photography. Finnerman, a second-generation cinematographer, was brought up in the old school of cinematography by working with his father, Perry Finnerman, and later as a camera operator for Harry Stradling on such films as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;. Finnerman then went on to be the director of photography for the TV series &quot;Star Trek&quot; and was responsible for creating much of the mood in that show by employing black-and-white lighting techniques for color film. This background meshed perfectly with what Caron was trying to portray in the series, and earned him an Emmy nomination for the black-and-white episode &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot;. Hired for the show after the pilot was shot, Finnerman became involved in virtually every aspect of the show, including the scripts, lighting, set design, and even directing some of the later episodes.

Typical scripts for an average one-hour television show run 60 pages, but those for &quot;Moonlighting&quot; were nearly twice as long because of the fast-talking, overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show took seven days to shoot, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; took from 12 to 14 days to complete, with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to &quot;Moonlighting&quot; being one of the most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; was running nearly double that. The season-two episode &quot;The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice&quot; could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film, which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of $2 million. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, &quot;The thinking in television which makes no damn sense to me, is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, it strikes me as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you&#x27;re hungry, whether you go to McDonald&#x27;s or whether you go to &#x27;21,&#x27; it should cost the same; they both fill your stomach. It&#x27;s nonsense.&quot;

All of this attention to detail resulted in production delays and the show became notorious for airing reruns when new episodes had not been completed in time for broadcast. The first two seasons of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; focused almost entirely on the two main characters, having them appear in almost every scene. According to Cybill Shepherd, &quot;I left home at 5 am each day. &quot;Moonlighting&quot; scripts were close to a hundred pages, half again as long as the average one-hour television series. Almost from the moment the cameras started rolling, we were behind schedule, sometimes completing as few as 16 episodes per season, and never achieving the standard 22.&quot;

Glenn Gordon Caron partly blamed Cybill Shepherd for production problems:
&quot;I don&#x27;t mean to paint her as the sole bearer of responsibility for the discord. But if I said to you, &#x27;You&#x27;re going to have a great new job – it&#x27;s a life-defining job – but you&#x27;re going to work 14–15 hours a day, and by the way, you&#x27;ll never know what hours those are – sometimes you&#x27;ll start at noon and work until 3 am; other times you won&#x27;t know when or where it will be [until the last minute].&#x27; It can be very difficult, it requires an amazing amount of stamina. It&#x27;s easier to do if you&#x27;re still reaching for the stars, it&#x27;s a lot tougher if you&#x27;re already a star, if you&#x27;ve already reached the top of the mountain.&quot;

Producer Jay Daniel talked about the difficulties between the costars in the later seasons: 
&quot;Well, I was the guy that more often than not would be the one that would go into the lion&#x27;s den when they were having disagreements. I&#x27;d sort of be the referee, try to resolve it so that we could get back to work. So there was that side of it. Everybody knows there was friction between the two of them on the stage. In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy&#x27;s guy. Let&#x27;s just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew&#x27;s best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I&#x27;d have to be the one who said you have to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at 6:30 in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn&#x27;t seen before, she&#x27;d work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at 6:30 the next morning.&quot;

The delays became so great that even ABC mocked the lateness with an ad campaign showing network executives waiting impatiently for the arrival of new episodes at ABC&#x27;s corporate headquarters. One episode featured television critic Jeff Jarvis in an introduction, sarcastically reminding viewers what was going on with the show&#x27;s plot since it had been so long since the last new episode.

The season-three clipshow episode &quot;The Straight Poop&quot; also made fun of the episode delays by having Hollywood columnist Rona Barrett drop by the Blue Moon Detective Agency to figure out why David and Maddie could not get along, as the premise to set up the clips from earlier episodes. In the end, Rona convinced them to apologize to one another, and promised the viewers that there would be an all-new episode the following week.

Shepherd&#x27;s real-life pregnancy and a skiing accident in which Willis broke his clavicle further contributed to production delays. To counter these problems, with the fourth season, the writers began to focus more of the show&#x27;s attention on supporting cast members Agnes and Herbert, writing several episodes focusing on the two so that the show would be able to have episodes ready for airing.

==Ratings and decline==
&quot;Moonlighting&quot; was a hit with TV audiences and with critics and industry insiders, with 16 Emmy nominations for the second season, in which &quot;Moonlighting&quot; tied for 20th place in the Nielsen ratings. In season three, the show peaked at 9th, then dropped off slightly to tie for 12th in the fourth season. By the end of the final season, the show was 49th in the ratings.

The show&#x27;s ratings decline is popularly attributed to episode 14 of season three, &quot;I Am Curious... Maddie&quot;, which had Maddie and David consummate their relationship after two and a half years of romantic tension. In commentaries on the third-season DVD set, Caron disputed that the event led to the show&#x27;s decline, but that a number of other factors led to the series&#x27; decline and eventual cancellation. In the fourth season, Willis and Shepherd had scant screen time together. Jay Daniel explained that: Bruce Willis was filming &quot;Die Hard&quot; during this period. When the film became a blockbuster, a film career beckoned and his desire to continue in a weekly series waned. In a series that depended on the chemistry between the two main stars, not having them together for the bulk of the fourth season hurt the ratings.

The series lost Glenn Gordon Caron as executive producer and head writer when he left the show over difficulties with the production: Shepherd recalled Caron left the show stating that it was either him or her, and he did not think the network would choose him.

When Maddie returned to Los Angeles near the end of the fourth season, the writers tried to recreate the tension between Maddie and David by having Maddie spontaneously marry a man named Walter Bishop (Dennis Dugan) within a few hours of meeting him on the train back to Los Angeles. When Shepherd read the script, she strongly voiced her objection that her character would not do such a thing, but was overruled. The move failed to rekindle the sparks between the main characters or capture the interest of the audience, which led to an even further ratings decline.

===Cancellation===
Neither of the principal stars was fully committed to the final season of the show. Bruce Willis, fresh from his &quot;Die Hard&quot; success, wanted to make more films. Cybill Shepherd, having just given birth to twins, had grown tired of the long, grueling production days and was ready for the series to end.

In the 1988–1989 TV season, the show&#x27;s ratings declined precipitously. The March to August 1988 Writers Guild of America strike canceled plans for the 1987–1988 &quot;Moonlighting&quot; season finale to be filmed and aired on TV in three dimensions in a deal with Coca-Cola, and delayed the broadcast of the first new episode until December 6, 1988. The series went on hiatus during the February sweeps, and returned on Sunday evenings in the spring of 1989. Six more episodes aired before the series was canceled in May of that year.

In keeping with the show&#x27;s tradition of &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot;, the last episode (fittingly titled &quot;Lunar Eclipse&quot;) featured Maddie and David returning from Agnes and Herbert&#x27;s wedding to find the Blue Moon sets being taken away, and an ABC network executive waiting to tell them that the show has been canceled. The characters then race through the studio lot in search of a television producer named Cy, as the world of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; is slowly dismantled.

When they find Cy, he is screening a print of &quot;In &#x27;n Outlaws&quot;, the episode of &quot;Moonlighting&quot; that had aired two weeks earlier. Once informed of the problem, Cy lectures David and Maddie on the perils of losing their audience and the fragility of romance. Cy was played by Dennis Dugan, the same actor who had played Walter Bishop in Maddie&#x27;s marriage storyline — however, Dugan was also the &quot;director&quot; of the episode, so his acting credit was listed as &quot;Walter Bishop&quot;. David and Maddie then admit defeat and that the show is ending, but not before Maddie tells David, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine not seeing you again tomorrow.&quot; This is followed by a clip montage of previous &quot;Moonlighting&quot; episodes, then the episode ends with a message stating, &quot;Blue Moon Investigations ceased operations on May 14, 1989. The Anselmo Case was never solved... and remains a mystery to this day.&quot;

===Syndication===
As the show had not produced enough episodes to gain a syndication contract, following its original run, it was not widely seen until its DVD release, although it occasionally appeared on cable channels targeting women (including Lifetime and Bravo in the US, and W in Canada) in the 1990s and 2000s. Bravo airings often featured new claymation promotions with Maddie and David using original audio clips from the series. The &quot;Atomic Shakespeare&quot; episode aired on Nick at Nite in 2005 as part of the network&#x27;s 20th-anniversary celebration. The 1985 ABC Tuesday-night line-up was honored with reruns of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, although &quot;Atomic Shakespeare&quot; was from the &#x27;86-&#x27;87 season.

BBC Two initially carried the show in the UK from 1986 to 1989, and it ran on Sky 1 &quot;circa&quot; 1991. It has been shown on CBS Drama since November 2009. Between 2005 and 2008, the show was frequently shown on the now-defunct channel ABC1. TVNZ aired the show in New Zealand in its entirety in the 1980s, and repeated it in 2004. In Asia, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; began airing seasons one and two on Rewind Network&#x27;s HITS channel in December 2013. On October 10, 2023, it had commenced streaming on Hulu, digitally remastered in HD. As of January 2025, it is also streaming on Amazon Prime Video.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;Moonlighting&quot; was nominated for a wide range of awards, including nominations for 40 Emmy Awards of which it won six. It was also nominated for 10 Golden Globe Awards of which it won three.

==Home media==
On February 6, 1991, the pilot was released on VHS by Warner Home Video.

Anchor Bay Entertainment released the original pilot episode on DVD in region 1. Lions Gate Entertainment later released the entire series of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;, including the pilot episode, on DVD in Region 1. Each release contains bonus features, including commentaries and featurettes. As of 2013, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

In Regions 2 and 4, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all five seasons on DVD, although the Region 4 sets are now out of print. A complete series box set was also released in Region 2 on September 14, 2009.

Following the release of the series on DVD in the mid-2000s, &quot;Moonlighting&quot; had not been available on any streaming platform because of the costly music licensing. However, on October 5, 2022, Caron posted on his official Twitter account that work had begun to prepare all five seasons of the series for streaming. In September 2023, it was announced that all 67 episodes of the series, remastered in high definition, would be made available on Disney&#x27;s streaming service Hulu starting October 10 that same year. The series will feature its theme song by Al Jarreau, and that &quot;great care&quot; was given to preserve as many original songs as possible. For example, songs sung by the actors and those that were deemed &quot;critical&quot; were retained, while songs used for background ambiance were replaced with new songs.

==Parodies==
&quot;Riptide&quot;, a once-popular detective series whose ratings had declined to the point of cancellation after airing against &quot;Moonlighting&quot; in the 1985–1986 television season, aired an episode (the show&#x27;s penultimate) in 1986, in which that show&#x27;s detectives acted as mentors to &quot;Rosalind Grant&quot; (Annette McCarthy) and &quot;Cary Russell&quot; (H. Richard Greene), the bickering stars of a television detective-show pilot. Although their names were an allusion to Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, the characters were written as parodies of Shepherd and Willis, even adopting some of their real mannerisms and clothing styles, and their dialogue contained many nods, both obvious and subtle, to &quot;Moonlighting&quot;&#x27;s writing style. The episode was explicitly promoted by NBC (&quot;Riptide&quot;&#x27;s network) as a &quot;Moonlighting&quot; parody, and was publicized as such widely enough that &quot;Riptide&quot;&#x27;s producers felt obliged to clarify that they liked &quot;Moonlighting&quot; and intended the episode as an &quot;homage&quot;. The episode was even titled &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Beat &#x27;Em, Join &#x27;Em&quot;.

The series even spawned a pornographic parody entitled &quot;Moonlusting&quot; in 1987, directed by Henri Pachard and starring Taija Rae as Hattie Mays and Jerry Butler as David Madison, together running the New Poon Detective Agency. The dynamic of the main characters mirrored that of Shepherd and Willis, even down to breaking the fourth wall and addressing viewers directly.

The show was parodied as &quot;Moon-Fighting&quot; in Mad Magazine #264 by Dick DeBartolo and Mort Drucker.

The show was also parodied on an episode of &quot;The Chipmunks&quot; titled &quot;Dreamlighting&quot; in 1988 with Alvin&#x27;s character named &quot;Alvinson&quot; based on David Addison.
