<text>A repurchase agreement, also known as a repo, RP, or sale and repurchase agreement, is a form of short-term borrowing, mainly in government securities. The dealer sells the underlying security to investors and, by agreement between the two parties, buys them back shortly afterwards, usually the following day, at a slightly higher price.

The repo market is an important source of funds for large financial institutions in the non-depository banking sector, which has grown to rival the traditional depository banking sector in size. Large institutional investors such as money market mutual funds lend money to financial institutions such as investment banks, in exchange for (or secured by) collateral, such as Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities held by the borrower financial institutions. An estimated $1 trillion per day in collateral value is transacted in the U.S. repo markets.

In 2007–2008, a run on the repo market, in which funding for investment banks was either unavailable or at very high interest rates, was a key aspect of the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession. During September 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in the role of investor to provide funds in the repo markets, when overnight lending rates jumped due to a series of technical factors that had limited the supply of funds available.

==Structure==

===Repo facility===
In a repo, the investor/lender provides cash to a borrower, with the loan secured by the collateral of the borrower, typically bonds. In the event the borrower defaults, the investor/lender gets the collateral. Investors are typically financial entities such as money market mutual funds, while borrowers are non-depository financial institutions such as investment banks and hedge funds. The investor/lender charges interest (the &quot;repo rate&quot;), which together with the principal is repaid on repurchase of the security as agreed. 

A repo is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer (effectively the lender or investor) receiving securities for collateral to protect himself against default by the seller. The party who initially sells the securities is effectively the borrower. Many types of institutional investors engage in repo transactions, including mutual funds and hedge funds. 

Although the transaction is similar to a loan, and its economic effect is similar to a loan, the terminology differs from that applying to loans: the seller legally repurchases the securities from the buyer at the end of the loan term. However, a key aspect of repos is that they are legally recognised as a single transaction (important in the event of counterparty insolvency) and not as a disposal and a repurchase for tax purposes. By structuring the transaction as a sale, a repo provides significant protections to lenders from the normal operation of U.S. bankruptcy laws, such as the automatic stay and avoidance provisions.

===Collateral===
Almost any security may be employed in a repo, though highly liquid securities are preferred as they are more easily disposed of in the event of a default and, more importantly, they can be easily obtained in the open market where the buyer has created a short position in the repo security by a reverse repo and market sale; by the same token, non liquid securities are discouraged.

Treasury or Government bills, corporate and Treasury/Government bonds, and stocks may all be used as &quot;collateral&quot; in a repo transaction. Unlike a secured loan, however, legal title to the securities passes from the seller to the buyer. Coupons (interest payable to the owner of the securities) falling due while the repo buyer owns the securities are, in fact, usually passed directly onto the repo seller. This might seem counter-intuitive, as the legal ownership of the collateral rests with the buyer during the repo agreement. The agreement might instead provide that the buyer receives the coupon, with the cash payable on repurchase being adjusted to compensate, though this is more typical of sell/buybacks.

===Overcollateralization (haircut)===
Further, the investor/lender may demand collateral of greater value than the amount that they lend. This difference is the &quot;haircut.&quot; These concepts are illustrated in the diagram and in the equations section. When investors perceive greater risks, they may charge higher repo rates and demand greater haircuts. 

===Reverse repo facility===
Whereas a repo facility is a security-buying party acting as a lender of cash to security sellers who effectively borrow cash at interest (the &quot;repo rate&quot;), with the security they sell serving as collateral, a reverse repo facility is a security-selling party allowing buyers with cash to effectively lend it to the facility at interest with the security they purchase serving as collateral. An example is a bank with cash deposits who loans it to a reverse repo facility to earn interest on it and contribute to their own collateral requirements (as deposit banks) with the collateral they obtain in the transaction. 

===Tri-party repo===
In a &quot;tri-party repo&quot;, a third party facilitates elements of the transaction, typically custody, escrow, monitoring, and other services. 

=== Structure and other terminology ===
The following table summarizes the terminology:

== History ==
In the United States, repos have been used from as early as 1917 when wartime taxes made older forms of lending less attractive. At first, repos were used just by the Federal Reserve to lend to other banks, but the practice soon spread to other market participants. The use of repos expanded in the 1920s, fell away through the Great Depression and WWII, then expanded once again in the 1950s, enjoying rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s in part due to computer technology.

According to Yale economist Gary Gorton, repo evolved to provide large non-depository financial institutions with a method of secured lending analogous to the depository insurance provided by the government in traditional banking, with the collateral acting as the guarantee for the investor.

In 1982, the failure of Drysdale Government Securities led to a loss of $285 million for Chase Manhattan Bank. This resulted in a change in how accrued interest is used in calculating the value of the repo securities. In the same year, the failure of Lombard-Wall, Inc. resulted in a change in the federal bankruptcy laws pertaining to repos. The failure of ESM Government Securities in 1985 led to the closing of Home State Savings Bank in Ohio and a run on other banks insured by the private-insurance Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund. The failure of these and other firms led to the enactment of the Government Securities Act of 1986.

In 2007–2008, a run on the repo market, in which funding for investment banks was either unavailable or at very high interest rates, was a key aspect of the subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession.

In July 2011, concerns arose among bankers and the financial press that if the 2011 U.S. debt ceiling crisis led to a default, it could cause considerable disruption to the repo market. This was because treasuries are the most commonly used collateral in the US repo market, and as a default would have downgraded the value of treasuries, it could have resulted in repo borrowers having to post far more collateral.
During September 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in the role of investor to provide funds in the repo markets, when overnight lending rates jumped due to a series of technical factors that had limited the supply of funds available.

=== Market size ===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in September 2019 that an estimated $1 trillion per day in collateral value is transacted in the U.S. repo markets. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports daily repo collateral volume for different types of repo arrangements. As of 24 October 2019, volumes were: secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) $1,086 billion; broad general collateral rate (BGCR) $453 billion, and tri-party general collateral rate (TGCR) $425 billion. These figures however, are not additive, as the latter 2 are merely components of the former, SOFR.

The Federal Reserve and the European Repo and Collateral Council (a body of the International Capital Market Association) have tried to estimate the size of their respective repo markets. At the end of 2004, the US repo market reached US$5 trillion. Especially in the US and to a lesser degree in Europe, the repo market contracted in 2008 as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis. But, by mid-2010, the market had largely recovered and, at least in Europe, had grown to exceed its pre-crisis peak.

== Repo expressed as mathematical formula ==
A repurchase agreement is a transaction concluded on a &quot;deal date tD&quot; between two parties &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;:

: (i) &quot;A&quot; will on the &quot;near date&quot; formula_1 sell a specified security &quot;S&quot; at an agreed price &quot;PN&quot; to &quot;B&quot;
: (ii) &quot;A&quot; will on the &quot;far date&quot; tF (after tN) re-purchase &quot;S&quot; from &quot;B&quot; at a price &quot;PF&quot; which is already pre-agreed on the deal date.

If positive interest rates are assumed, the repurchase price PF can be expected to be greater than the original sale price PN.

The (time-adjusted) difference formula_2 is called the &quot;repo rate&quot;, which is the annualized interest rate of the transaction. formula_3 can be interpreted as the interest rate for the period between &quot;near date&quot; and &quot;far date&quot;.

== Ambiguity in the usage of the term repo ==
The term &quot;repo&quot; has given rise to a lot of misunderstanding: there are two types of transactions with identical cash flows:

: (i) a &quot;sell-and-buy-back&quot; as well as,
: (ii) a collateralized borrowing.

The sole difference is that in (i) the asset is sold (and later re-purchased), whereas in (ii) the asset is instead pledged as a collateral for a loan: in the &quot;sell-and-buy-back transaction&quot;, the ownership and possession of &quot;S&quot; are transferred at tN from a &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and in tF transferred back from &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot;; conversely, in the collateralized borrowing, only the possession is temporarily transferred to &quot;B&quot; whereas the ownership remains with &quot;A&quot;.

== Maturities of repos ==
There are two types of repo maturities: term, and open repo.

&quot;Term&quot; refers to a repo with a specified end date: although repos are typically short-term (a few days), it is not unusual to see repos with a maturity as long as two years.

&quot;Open&quot; has no end date which has been fixed at conclusion.
Depending on the contract, the maturity is either set until the next business day and the repo matures unless one party renews it for a variable number of business days. Alternatively it has no maturity date – but one or both parties have the option to terminate the transaction within a pre-agreed time frame.

== Types ==
Repo transactions occur in three forms: specified delivery, tri-party, and held in custody (wherein the &quot;selling&quot; party holds the security during the term of the repo). The third form (hold-in-custody) is quite rare, particularly in developing markets, primarily due to the risk that the seller will become insolvent prior to maturation of the repo and the buyer will be unable to recover the securities that were posted as collateral to secure the transaction. The first form—specified delivery—requires the delivery of a prespecified bond at the onset, and at maturity of the contractual period. Tri-party is essentially a basket form of transaction and allows for a wider range of instruments in the basket or pool. In a tri-party repo transaction, a third party clearing agent or bank is interposed between the &quot;seller&quot; and the &quot;buyer&quot;. The third party maintains control of the securities that are the subject of the agreement and processes the payments from the &quot;seller&quot; to the &quot;buyer.&quot;

=== Due bill/hold in-custody repo / bilateral repo ===
In a due bill repo, the collateral pledged by the (cash) borrower is not actually delivered to the cash lender. Rather, it is placed in an internal account (&quot;held in custody&quot;) by the borrower, for the lender, throughout the duration of the trade. This has become less common as the repo market has grown, particularly owing to the creation of centralized counterparties. Due to the high risk to the cash lender, these are generally only transacted with large, financially stable institutions.

=== Tri-party repo ===
The distinguishing feature of a tri-party repo is that a custodian bank or international clearing organization, the tri-party agent, acts as an intermediary between the two parties to the repo. The tri-party agent is responsible for the administration of the transaction, including collateral allocation, marking to market, and substitution of collateral. In the US, the two principal tri-party agents are The Bank of New York Mellon and JP Morgan Chase, whilst in Europe the principal tri-party agents are Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking SA with SIX offering services in the Swiss market. The size of the US tri-party repo market peaked in 2008 before the worst effects of the 2007–2008 financial crisis at approximately $2.8 trillion and by mid-2010 was about $1.6 trillion.

As tri-party agents administer the equivalent of hundreds of billions of USD of global collateral, they have the scale to subscribe to multiple data feeds to maximise the universe of coverage. As part of a tri-party agreement the three parties to the agreement, the tri-party agent, the repo buyer (the Collateral Taker/Cash Provider, &quot;CAP&quot;) and the repo seller (Cash Borrower/Collateral Provider, &quot;COP&quot;) agree to a collateral management service agreement which includes an &quot;eligible collateral profile&quot;.

It is this &quot;eligible collateral profile&quot; that enables the repo buyer to define their risk appetite in respect of the collateral that they are prepared to hold against their cash. For example, a more risk averse repo buyer may wish to only hold &quot;on-the-run&quot; government bonds as collateral. In the event of a liquidation event of the repo seller the collateral is highly liquid thus enabling the repo buyer to sell the collateral quickly. A less risk averse repo buyer may be prepared to take non investment grade bonds or equities as collateral, which may be less liquid and may suffer a higher price volatility in the event of a repo seller default, making it more difficult for the repo buyer to sell the collateral and recover their cash. The tri-party agents are able to offer sophisticated collateral eligibility filters which allow the repo buyer to create these &quot;eligible collateral profiles&quot; which can systemically generate collateral pools which reflect the buyer&#x27;s risk appetite.

Collateral eligibility criteria could include asset type, issuer, currency, domicile, credit rating, maturity, index, issue size, average daily traded volume, etc. Both the lender (repo buyer) and borrower (repo seller) of cash enter into these transactions to avoid the administrative burden of bi-lateral repos. In addition, because the collateral is being held by an agent, counterparty risk is reduced. A tri-party repo may be seen as the outgrowth of the &quot;&#x27;due bill repo&quot;. A due bill repo is a repo in which the collateral is retained by the Cash borrower and not delivered to the cash provider. There is an increased element of risk when compared to the tri-party repo as collateral on a due bill repo is held within a client custody account at the Cash Borrower rather than a collateral account at a neutral third party.

=== Whole loan repo ===
A whole loan repo is a form of repo where the transaction is collateralized by a loan or other form of obligation (e.g., mortgage receivables) rather than a security.

=== Equity repo ===
The underlying security for many repo transactions is in the form of government or corporate bonds. Equity repos are simply repos on equity securities such as common (or ordinary) shares. Some complications can arise because of greater complexity in the tax rules for dividends as opposed to coupons.

=== Sell/buybacks and buy/sell backs ===
A sell/buyback is the spot sale and a forward repurchase of a security. It is two distinct outright cash market trades, one for forward settlement. The forward price is set relative to the spot price to yield a market rate of return. The basic motivation of sell/buybacks is generally the same as for a classic repo (i.e., attempting to benefit from the lower financing rates generally available for collateralized as opposed to non-secured borrowing). The economics of the transaction are also similar, with the interest on the cash borrowed through the sell/buyback being implicit in the difference between the sale price and the purchase price.

There are a number of differences between the two structures. A repo is technically a single transaction whereas a sell/buyback is a pair of transactions (a sell and a buy).
A sell/buyback does not require any special legal documentation while a repo generally requires a master agreement to be in place between the buyer and seller (typically the SIFMA/ICMA commissioned Global Master Repo Agreement (GMRA)). For this reason, there is an associated increase in risk compared to repo. Should the counterparty default, the lack of agreement may lessen legal standing in retrieving collateral. Any coupon payment on the underlying security during the life of the sell/buyback will generally be passed back to the buyer of the security by adjusting the cash paid at the termination of the sell/buyback. In a repo, the coupon will be passed on immediately to the seller of the security.

A buy/sell back is the equivalent of a &quot;reverse repo&quot;.

=== Securities lending ===
In securities lending, the purpose is to temporarily obtain the security for other purposes, such as covering short positions or for use in complex financial structures. Securities are generally lent out for a fee and securities lending trades are governed by different types of legal agreements than repos.

Repos have traditionally been used as a form of collateralized loan and have been treated as such for tax purposes. Modern Repo agreements, however, often allow the cash lender to sell the security provided as collateral and substitute an identical security at repurchase.

=== Reverse repo ===
A reverse repo is simply the same repurchase agreement from the buyer&#x27;s viewpoint, not the seller&#x27;s. Hence, the seller executing the transaction would describe it as a &quot;repo&quot;, while the buyer in the same transaction would describe it a &quot;reverse repo&quot;. So &quot;repo&quot; and &quot;reverse repo&quot; are exactly the same kind of transaction, just being described from opposite viewpoints. The term &quot;reverse repo and sale&quot; is commonly used to describe the creation of a short position in a debt instrument where the buyer in the repo transaction immediately sells the security provided by the seller on the open market. On the settlement date of the repo, the buyer acquires the relevant security on the open market and delivers it to the seller. In such a short transaction, the buyer is wagering that the relevant security will decline in value between the date of the repo and the settlement date.

== Uses ==
For the buyer, a repo is an opportunity to invest cash for a customized period of time (other investments typically limit tenures). It is short-term and safer as a secured investment since the investor receives collateral. Market liquidity for repos is good, and rates are competitive for investors. Money Funds are large buyers of Repurchase Agreements.

For traders in trading firms, repos are used to finance long positions (in the securities they post as collateral), obtain access to cheaper funding costs for long positions in other speculative investments, and cover short positions in securities (via a &quot;reverse repo and sale&quot;).

=== United States Federal Reserve use of repos ===
When transacted by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve in open market operations, repurchase agreements add reserves to the banking system and then after a specified period of time withdraw them; reverse repos initially drain reserves and later add them back. This tool can also be used to stabilize interest rates, and the Federal Reserve has used it to adjust the federal funds rate to match the target rate.

Under a repurchase agreement, the Federal Reserve (Fed) buys U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, or mortgage-backed securities from a primary dealer who agrees to buy them back within typically one to seven days; a reverse repo is the opposite. Thus, the Fed describes these transactions from the counterparty&#x27;s viewpoint rather than from their own viewpoint.

If the Federal Reserve is one of the transacting parties, the RP is called a &quot;system repo&quot;, but if they are trading on behalf of a customer (e.g., a foreign central bank), it is called a &quot;customer repo&quot;. Until 2003, the Fed did not use the term &quot;reverse repo&quot;—which it believed implied that it was borrowing money (counter to its charter)—but used the term &quot;matched sale&quot; instead.

=== Reserve Bank of India&#x27;s use of repos ===
In India, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses repo and reverse repo to increase or decrease money supply in the economy. The rate at which the RBI lends to commercial banks is called the repo rate. In case of inflation, the RBI may increase the repo rate, thus discouraging banks to borrow and reducing the money supply in the economy. As of September 2020, the RBI repo rate is set at 4.00% and the reverse repo rate at 3.35%.

=== Lehman Brothers&#x27; use of repos as a mis-classified sale ===
The investment bank Lehman Brothers used repos nicknamed &quot;repo 105&quot; and &quot;repo 108&quot; as a creative accounting strategy to bolster their profitability reports for a few days during reporting season, and mis-classified the repos as true sales. New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo alleged that this practice was fraudulent and happened under the watch of accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young. Charges have been filed against E&amp;Y, with the allegations stating that the firm approved the practice of using repos for &quot;the surreptitious removal of tens of billions of dollars of securities from Lehman’s balance sheet in order to create a false impression of Lehman’s liquidity, thereby defrauding the investing public&quot;.

In the Lehman Brothers case, repos were used as Tobashi schemes to temporarily conceal significant losses by intentionally timed, half-completed trades during the reporting season. This mis-use of repos is similar to the swaps by Goldman Sachs in the &quot;Greek Debt Mask&quot; which were used as a Tobashi scheme to legally circumvent the Maastricht Treaty deficit rules for active European Union members and allowed Greece to &quot;hide&quot; more than 2.3 billion Euros of debt.

== Risks ==
While classic repos are generally credit-risk mitigated instruments, there are residual credit risks. Though it is essentially a collateralized transaction, the seller may fail to repurchase the securities sold, at the maturity date. In other words, the repo seller defaults on their obligation. Consequently, the buyer may keep the security, and liquidate the security to recover the cash lent. The security, however, may have lost value since the outset of the transaction, as the security is subject to market movements. To mitigate this risk, repos often are over-collateralized as well as being subject to daily mark-to-market margining (i.e., if the collateral falls in value, a margin call can be triggered asking the borrower to post extra securities). Conversely, if the value of the security rises there is a credit risk for the borrower in that the creditor may not sell them back. If this is considered to be a risk, then the borrower may negotiate a repo which is under-collateralized.

Credit risk associated with repo is subject to many factors: term of repo, liquidity of security, the strength of the counterparties involved, etc.

Certain forms of repo transactions came into focus within the financial press due to the technicalities of settlements following the collapse of Refco in 2005. Occasionally, a party involved in a repo transaction may not have a specific bond at the end of the repo contract. This may cause a string of failures from one party to the next, for as long as different parties have transacted for the same underlying instrument. The focus of the media attention centers on attempts to mitigate these failures.

In 2008, attention was drawn to a form known as repo 105 following the Lehman collapse, as it was alleged that repo 105s had been used as an accounting trick to hide Lehman&#x27;s worsening financial health. Another controversial form of repurchase order is the &quot;internal repo&quot; which first came to prominence in 2005. In 2011, it was suggested that repos used to finance risky trades in sovereign European bonds may have been the mechanism by which MF Global put at risk some several hundred million dollars of client funds, before its bankruptcy in October 2011. Much of the collateral for the repos is understood to have been obtained by the rehypothecation of other collateral belonging to the clients.

During September 2019, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened in the role of investor to provide funds in the repo markets, when overnight lending rates jumped due to a series of technical factors that had limited the supply of funds available.

<text>Mount Auburn Cemetery, located in Cambridge and Watertown, Massachusetts, is the first rural or garden cemetery in the United States. It is the burial site of many prominent Boston Brahmins, and is a National Historic Landmark.

Dedicated in 1831 and set with classical monuments in a rolling landscaped terrain, it marked a distinct break with Colonial-era burying grounds and church-affiliated graveyards. The appearance of this type of landscape coincides with the rising popularity of the term &quot;cemetery,&quot; derived from the Greek for &quot;a sleeping place,&quot; instead of graveyard. This language and outlook eclipsed the previous harsh view of death and the afterlife embodied by old graveyards and church burial plots.

The cemetery is important both for its historical aspects and for its role as an arboretum. It is Watertown&#x27;s largest contiguous open space and extends into Cambridge to the east, adjacent to the Cambridge City Cemetery and Sand Banks Cemetery. It was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2003 for its pioneering role in 19th-century cemetery development.

==History==

The land that became Mount Auburn Cemetery was originally named Stone&#x27;s Farm, though locals referred to it as &quot;Sweet Auburn&quot; after the 1770 poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot; by Oliver Goldsmith. Mount Auburn Cemetery was inspired by Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and was itself an inspiration to cemetery designers, most notably at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn (1838), Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, and Abney Park in London. Mount Auburn Cemetery was designed largely by Henry Alexander Scammell Dearborn with assistance from Jacob Bigelow and Alexander Wadsworth.

Bigelow came up with the idea for Mount Auburn as early as 1825, though a site was not acquired until five years later. Bigelow, a medical doctor, was concerned about the unhealthiness of burials under churches as well as the possibility of running out of space. With help from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, Mount Auburn Cemetery was founded on of land authorized by the Massachusetts Legislature for use as a garden or rural cemetery. The original land cost $6,000; it was later extended to . The main gate was built in the Egyptian Revival style and cost . The first president of the Mount Auburn Association, Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, dedicated the cemetery in 1831. Story&#x27;s dedication address, delivered on September 24, 1831, set the model for many more addresses in the following three decades. Garry Wills focuses on it as an important precursor to President Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address.

The cemetery is credited as the beginning of the American public parks and gardens movement. It set the style for other suburban American cemeteries such as Laurel Hill Cemetery (Philadelphia, 1836), Mount Hope Cemetery (Bangor, Maine, 1834), America&#x27;s first municipal rural cemetery; Green-Wood Cemetery (Brooklyn, 1838), The Green Mount Cemetery (Baltimore, Maryland, 1839) Mount Hope Cemetery (Rochester, NY, 1838), Lowell Cemetery (Lowell, Massachusetts, 1841), Allegheny Cemetery (Pittsburgh, 1844), Albany Rural Cemetery (Menands, New York, 1844), Swan Point Cemetery (Providence, Rhode Island 1846), Spring Grove Cemetery (Cincinnati, 1844), and Forest Hills Cemetery (Jamaica Plain, 1848) as well as Oakwood Cemetery in Syracuse, New York. It can be considered the link between Capability Brown&#x27;s English landscape gardens and Frederick Law Olmsted&#x27;s Central Park in New York (1850s).

Mount Auburn was established at a time when Americans had a sentimental interest in rural cemeteries. It is still well known for its tranquil atmosphere and accepting attitude toward death. Many of the more traditional monuments feature poppy flowers, symbols of blissful sleep. In the late 1830s, its first unofficial guide, &quot;Picturesque Pocket Companion and Visitor&#x27;s Guide Through Mt. Auburn&quot;, was published and featured descriptions of some of the more interesting monuments as well as a collection of prose and poetry about death by writers including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Willis Gaylord Clark. Because of the number of visitors, the cemetery&#x27;s developers carefully regulated the grounds: they had a policy to remove &quot;offensive and improper&quot; monuments and only &quot;proprietors&quot; (i.e., plot owners) could have vehicles on the grounds and were allowed within the gates on Sundays and holidays. However, Mount Auburn differed from previously established cemeteries in that it was open to the general public and was not restricted to specific religious groups, reflecting the growing religious pluralism of Boston during the time.

In the 1840s, Mount Auburn was considered one of the most popular tourist destinations in the nation, along with Niagara Falls and Mount Vernon. A 16-year-old Emily Dickinson wrote about her visit to Mount Auburn in a letter in 1846. 60,000 people visited the cemetery in 1848 alone.

==Buildings==

The cemetery has three notable buildings on its grounds. Washington Tower was designed by Bigelow and built in 1852–54. Named for George Washington, the tower was built of Quincy granite and provides excellent views of the area. Bigelow Chapel was built in the 1840s and rebuilt in the 1850s, also of Quincy granite, and was renovated in 1899 under the direction of architect Willard Sears to accommodate a crematorium. Its interior was again renovated in 1924 by Allen &amp; Collens. Through all of these alterations, stained-glass windows by the Scottish firm of Allan &amp; Ballantyne were preserved.

In 1870 the cemetery trustees, feeling the need for additional function space, purchased land across Mount Auburn Street and constructed a reception house. This building was supplanted in the 1890s by the construction of the Story Chapel and Administration Building, adjacent to the main gate. The first reception house was designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee, and is (like the cemetery) listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The second building was designed by Willard Sears, and is built of Potsdam sandstone in what Sears characterized as &quot;English Perpendicular Style&quot;. The chapel in this building was redecorated in 1929 by Allen &amp; Collens to include stained-glass by New England artist Earl E. Sanborn.

==Today==

More than 93,000 people are buried in the cemetery as of 2003. A number of historically significant people have been interred there since its inception, particularly members of the Boston Brahmins and the Boston elite associated with Harvard University, as well as a number of prominent Unitarians.

The cemetery is nondenominational and continues to make space available for new plots. The area is well known for its beautiful environs and is a favorite location for bird-watchers; over 220 species of birds have been observed at the cemetery since 1958. Guided tours of the cemetery&#x27;s historic, artistic, and horticultural points of interest are available.

Mount Auburn&#x27;s collection of over 5,500 trees includes nearly 700 species and varieties. Thousands of very well-kept shrubs and herbaceous plants weave through the cemetery&#x27;s hills, ponds, woodlands, and clearings. The cemetery contains more than 10 miles (17 km) of roads and many paths. Landscaping styles range from Victorian-era plantings to contemporary gardens, from natural woodlands to formal ornamental gardens, and from sweeping vistas through majestic trees to small enclosed spaces. Many trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants are tagged with botanic labels containing their scientific and common names.

The cemetery was among those profiled in the 2005 PBS documentary &quot;A Cemetery Special&quot;.

<text>Gregory Rusedski (born 6 September 1973) is a Canadian-British former professional tennis player. He was the British No. 1 in 1997, 1999 and 2006, and reached the ATP ranking of world No. 4 for periods from 6 October 1997 to 12 October 1997 and from 25 May 1998 to 21 June 1998.

In 1997, he was the US Open finalist, which led to him receiving the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award and the ITV Sports Champion of the Year Award. Also, he scored 30 wins and 13 losses with the Great Britain Davis Cup team. Along with erstwhile rival and teammate Tim Henman, Rusedski was credited with beginning a renaissance in British men&#x27;s singles tennis from the doldrums of the eighties and nineties, reaching a grand slam final and returning Great Britain to relevance in the Davis Cup, progress that would eventually be brought to fruition by Andy Murray.

==Personal life==
Rusedski was born in Montreal, Quebec, to a British mother and a Canadian father of Polish and Ukrainian descent. He was a very promising junior player in Canada in the 1980s, and subsequently caused some anger in Canada when he decided to adopt British citizenship and play for Great Britain in 1995. Rusedski made the decision for &quot;lifestyle reasons&quot;, noting that his girlfriend — who later became his wife — lived in Britain.

Rusedski has been with his wife Lucy Connor since 1991, they met while he was competing in a junior tournament where she was a ball girl. They married in a Catholic ceremony at Douai Abbey in West Berkshire in December 1999. They have two children: a daughter born in 2006, and a son born in 2009.

==Career==

Rusedski&#x27;s first career singles tournament title was at the Hall of Fame Championship in Newport, Rhode Island in 1993. He opted to compete for the United Kingdom rather than Canada from 22 May 1995 onwards, a decision which was received poorly by Canadian fans; it was reported that he was given a &quot;traitor&#x27;s reception&quot; by the crowd when he competed in his first Canadian Open after the switch.

Rusedski reached the singles final of the US Open in 1997, where he lost to Pat Rafter in four sets (shortly thereafter reaching his career high rank of world No. 4). He also won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award and the ITV Sports Champion of the Year Award. In 1998, Tim Henman eclipsed Rusedski as the UK number one tennis player. Rusedski, however, won the Grand Slam Cup in 1999.

In the 1999 US Open, Rusedski reached the fourth round where he was eliminated 5–7, 0–6, 7–6 (7–3), 6–4, 6–4, by Todd Martin; Rusedski had a two-sets-to-none advantage and was serving for the match in the third set, then in the fifth set he was up 4–1, but lost 20 of the final 21 points including a stretch of 18 consecutive points.

In the 2002 US Open, after losing to Pete Sampras in the third round in a grueling five-set match, Rusedski described Sampras as &quot;a half-step slow&quot; and predicted that Sampras would lose his fourth-round match to young German star Tommy Haas. Sampras, however, went on to win the tournament.

At Wimbledon in 2003, Rusedski was playing in a second-round match against Andy Roddick. Roddick had won the first two sets, but Rusedski was 5–2 up in the third set. During a point on Roddick&#x27;s service game, a member of the crowd loudly called one of Roddick&#x27;s shots long, causing Rusedski to stop playing the point as he believed it was a line judge. The umpire ruled that the ball was good and that, as Roddick&#x27;s next shot landed in court, Roddick was awarded the point. Rusedski, believing the point should have been replayed, launched into a long and expletive-riddled tirade at the umpire and, never regaining his composure, went on to lose the next five games without reply to concede the match. Rusedski apologized after the match, and Roddick reached the semifinals.

Rusedski tested positive for nandrolone in January 2004, but he was cleared of the charges in a hearing on 10 March 2004.

Rusedski was defeated in the second round of Wimbledon in 2005 by Joachim Johansson of Sweden. Later that year, he defended his title at the Hall of Fame Championship, defeating Vince Spadea in the final. This was the first time he had successfully defended a title and the third time he had won the championship. He then reached the semifinals at both the RCA Championships in Indianapolis, losing to Taylor Dent, and the Canada Masters tournament in Montreal, losing to Andre Agassi.

Towards the end of 2005, Rusedski&#x27;s ranking had risen to the high 30s. A defeat for Rusedski in the first round of the Challenger event in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, left him ranked 38th, just one place short of regaining the UK top spot. Rusedski reclaimed the UK number-one spot on 15 May 2006, overtaking Andy Murray by getting to the third round of the Rome Masters. He lost the top UK ranking again after a first-round exit at Wimbledon.

On 7 April 2007, Rusedski officially retired from tennis after partnering with Jamie Murray to a doubles victory over the Netherlands in a Davis Cup match, a result which gave Great Britain a winning 3–0 lead in the tie. He announced his retirement immediately after the win during a live interview with Sue Barker on BBC Television. Rusedski has stayed involved with professional tennis in his retirement, and currently works for the Lawn Tennis Association as a talent and performance ambassador. Rusedski held the record for fastest serve at 149 miles per hour until Andy Roddick broke it.

On 24 January 2009, Rusedski confirmed he had been seeking a return to professional tennis. However, Davis Cup captain John Lloyd turned down his offer to compete in the Davis Cup, and Rusedski was unable to obtain any wild-card tournament entries. Because of this, Rusedski quickly retracted his announcement and is still retired.

Rusedski was often overshadowed in the British press by Tim Henman, especially at Wimbledon.

==Media career==
Rusedski has an active media career, having written columns for &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He also works for the television channel British Eurosport providing analysis during the stations&#x27; coverage of the Australian Open. He provided commentary and analysis for Sky Sports for their coverage of the US Open and ATP World Tour Events, and for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of Wimbledon. He has done some acting, appearing in an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; as a tennis player. In 2008, he appeared as a contestant on the reality TV shows &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; and &quot;Beat the Star&quot;. He has appeared in &quot;Dictionary Corner&quot; on the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot;.

<doc id="517436" wikidata="Q2427934" url="?curid=517436" title="Nizamuddin Auliya">
<text>Khawaja Syed Muhammad Nizamuddin Auliya (sometimes spelled Awliya; 1238 – 3 April 1325), also known as Hazrat Nizamuddin (), Sultan-ul-Mashaikh () and Mahbub-e-Ilahi (), was an Indian Sunni Muslim scholar, Sufi saint of the Chishti Order, and is one of the most famous Sufis from the Indian Subcontinent. His predecessors were Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, and Moinuddin Chishti, who were the masters of the Chishti spiritual chain or &quot;silsila&quot; in the Indian subcontinent.

Nizamuddin Auliya, like his predecessors, stressed love as a means of realising God. For him his love of God implied a love of humanity. His vision of the world was marked by a highly evolved sense of religious pluralism and kindness. It is claimed by the 14th century historiographer Ziauddin Barani that his influence on the Muslims of Delhi was such that a paradigm shift was effected in their outlook towards worldly matters. People began to be inclined towards mysticism and prayers and remaining aloof from the world. It is also believed that Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, the founder of Tughluq dynasty, interacted with Nizamuddin. Initially, they used to share good relationship but soon this got embittered and relation between Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq and Nizamuddin Auliya never been reformed due to opinion disharmony and their antagonism resulted regular disputes between them during that era.

==Life==

Nizamuddin Auliya was born in a Sayyid family in Badayun, Uttar Pradesh. At the age of five, after the death of his father, Syed Abdullah bin Ahmad AlHussaini Badayuni, he came to Delhi with his mother, Bibi Zulekha. His biography finds mention in &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot;, a 16th-century document written by Mughal Emperor Akbar&#x27;s vizier, Abu&#x27;l-Fazl ibn Mubarak.

At the age of twenty, Nizāmuddīn went to Ajodhan (the present Pakpattan Sharif in Punjab, Pakistan) and became a disciple of the Sufi saint Fariduddin Ganjshakar, commonly known as Baba Farid. Nizāmuddīn did not take up residence in Ajodhan but continued with his theological studies in Delhi while simultaneously starting the Sufi devotional practices and the prescribed litanies. He visited Ajodhan each year to spend the month of Ramadan in the presence of Baba Farid. It was on his third visit to Ajodhan that Baba Farid made him his successor. Shortly after that, when Nizāmuddīn returned to Delhi, he received news that Baba Farid had died.
Nizāmuddīn lived at various places in Delhi, before finally settling down in Ghiyaspur, a neighbourhood in Delhi undisturbed by the noise and hustle of city life. He built his Khanqah here, a place where people from all walks of life were fed, where he imparted spiritual education to others and he had his own quarters. Before long, the Khanqah became a place thronged with all kinds of people, rich and poor alike.

Many of his disciples achieved spiritual height, including Shaikh Nasiruddin Chirag Delhav&quot;i&quot;, and Amir Khusro, noted scholar/singer, and the royal poet of the Delhi Sultanate.

He died on the morning of 3 April 1325. His shrine, the Nizamuddin Dargah, is located in Delhi. and the present structure was built in 1562. The shrine is visited by people of all faiths, through the year, though it becomes a place for special congregation during the death anniversaries, or Urs, of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amīr Khusrao, who is also buried at the Nizāmuddīn Dargāh.

==Key beliefs==
Besides believing in the traditional Sufi ideas of embracing God within this life by destroying the ego and cleansing the soul, and that this is possible through considerable efforts involving Sufi practices, Nizamuddin also expanded and practised the unique features introduced by past saints of the Chisti Sufi order in India. These included: 
* Emphasis on renunciation and having complete trust in God.
* The unity of mankind and shunning distinctions based on social and economic status.
* Helping the needy, feeding the hungry and being sympathetic to the oppressed.
* Strong disapproval of mixing with the Sultans, the princes and the nobles.
* Exhortation in making close contact with the poor and the downtrodden
* Adopting an uncompromising attitude towards all forms of political and social oppression.
* Adopting the permissibility of Sema.
* Holding the stance however that Sema is only permissible when musical instruments and dancing are not present.
* Holding the orthodox Sunni belief that musical instruments are prohibited.

Nizamuddin did not much bother about the theoretical aspects of Sufism, believing rather that it were the practical aspects that counted, as it was anyway not possible to describe the diversified mystical experiences called spiritual states or stations which a practicing Sufi encountered. He discouraged the demonstration of Karamat and emphasised that it was obligatory for the Auliya to hide the ability of Keramat from the commoners. He also was quite generous in accepting disciples. Usually whoever came to him saying that he wanted to become a disciple was granted that favour. This resulted in him being always surrounded by people from all strata of society.

== Ancestral history ==
Like many saints before him, Nizamuddin Aulia traced his lineage from the family of Muhammad.

==Spiritual history==

He was merely sixteen or seventeen years old when he first heard the name of Farīduddīn Ganjshakar, and feelings of love and respect arose in his heart right then. He narrates to his disciples that he never felt the same after hearing or even meeting any other Sufi. The love kept increasing like a burning fire. If his classmates would like to have some work out of him they used to invoke the name of Baba Farid, and he never refused anything asked in his name. He didn&#x27;t feel the same for anyone else in his entire lifetime. He became his disciple after completing his studies at the age of 20. He visited him thrice in his lifetime.

== Students ==

He had more than 600 khalifas (a khalifa is a disciple who is given the authority to take his own disciples and thus propagate the spiritual lineage) who continued his lineage all over the world. Some of his most famous disciples are:

* Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi: He was the spiritual successor of Nizamuddin Auliya. He is considered fifth amongst the big five of the Chisti order in India (the others being Moinuddin Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganjshakar, Nizamuddin Auliya). His shrine is in Chirag Dilli, New Delhi, India.
* Amir Khusrow: He was the most loved disciple of his master. He was so close to his master that once Nizāmuddīn Auliyā&#x27; said, &quot;If the sharī&#x27;ah allowed me I would have liked him to be buried with me in the same grave.&quot; It is said that he also said once that whoever comes to visit his grave must visit the grave of Amīr Khusro first and then his. He died within a few months of his master&#x27;s death. He was buried at the feet of his master. His shrine is in Nizāmuddīn Dargāh, New Delhi.
* Qazi Qawam-Udeen Siddiqui: He was given the title Zubtadul Awliya and was a disciple of his master. He along with his father-in-law Qazi Sultan Zulqarni build Rohtak fort. His descendants are named Qawami Siddiquis and now number in thousands, all have migrated to Pakistan and can be found in Mirpur AK, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore and Multan.
* Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind: He was given the title of &quot;Āainae-Hind&quot; (Mirror of India) by Nizāmuddīn Auliyā&#x27; and lived with him for a long time. He was amongst the earliest disciples of Nizāmuddīn Auliyā&#x27;, who sent him to Bengal. His shrine is at Pirana Pir Dargah, Malda City, Malda, West Bengal.
* Burhanuddin Gharib: He is also amongst the earliest disciples of Nizamuddin Auliya and lived with the master until his death. After the death of Nizamuddin Auliya, he went to the Deccan, and the place where he lived became famous thereby. His shrine is in Khuldabad in Maharashtra.
* Hasan Sijzi: Author the spiritual manual &quot;Fawaid ul Fuad&quot;, a famous compilation of the discourses of Nizamuddin Awliya

==Descendants==
Nizamuddin Auliya had one brother named Jamaluddin. He told him, &quot;your descendants will be my descendants&quot;. Jamaluddin had one son named Ibrahim. He was nurtured by Nizamuddin Auliya after Jamaluddin&#x27;s death. Nizamuddin Auliya sent his nephew to Bengal in Eastern India along with one of his disciples (khalifa) Akhi Siraj Aainae Hind, known as Aaina-e-Hind. Alaul Haq Pandavi (the master (Pir) of Ashraf Jahangir Semnani) became his disciple and khalifa. Ala-ul-Haq Pandwi married his sister-in-law (sister of Syed Badruddin Badr-e-Alam Zahidi) to Ibrahim. They had one son, Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh, who became a well known Chisti Sufi of Bihar. He was married to the daughter of Alaul Haq Pandavi. He became the khalifa of Noor Qutb-e-Aalam Padwi (the eldest son and spiritual successor of Alaul Haq Pandavi). His shrine is in Chandpura, Bihar Sharif, Bihar. Many of his descendants are well known Sufis, namely Moinuddin Sani, Naseeruddin Sani, Sultan Chisti Nizami, Bahauddin Chisti Nizami, Deewan Syed Shah Abdul Wahab (his shrine is in Choti Takiya, Biharsharif), Sultan Sani, Amjad Hussain Chisti Nizami, among others. He spread Chisti Nizami order all over Northern India. Ijaza of his Silsila (order) is present in all the existing khanqahs of Bihar. His descendants still reside in Bihar Sharif and can be found in many parts of the world. The current Sajjada Nasheen of Chillah of Usman Harooni is his direct descendant. Fariduddin Tavaela Bukhsh commemorated (originated) the Urs of Usman Harooni at his chillah in Belchi, Bihar Sharif (First Sajjada Nasheen).

Nizamuddin Aulia also had one sister named Bibi Ruqayya who is buried next to Bibi Zulekha, the mother of Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia in Adhchini village in Delhi. Nizamuddin Auliya did not marry. He brought his Pir/Shaikh&#x27;s grandson named Khwaja Muhammad Imam, who was the son of Bibi Fatima (daughter of Baba Farid and Badruddin is&#x27;haq) as mentioned in Seyrul Aulia book, Nizami bansari, The life and time of Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia by Khaliq Ahmed Nizami. Still the descendants of Khwaja Muhammad Imam are the caretakers of dargah sharif.

== The Chisti Nizami order ==

Nizamuddin Auliya was the founder of the Chisti Nizami order. He had hundreds of disciples (khalifa) who had Ijaza (khilafat) from him to spread the order. Many of the Sufis of the Chisti Nizami order are recognised as great Sufis; the following is a list of notable Sufis of the Chisti Nizami order, which includes his descendants as well as his disciples and their subsequent disciples:

Nasiruddin Mahmud Chiragh Dehlavi, Amir Khusro, Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gesudaraz Muhammad al-Hussaini, Alaul Haq Pandavi and Nur Qutb Alam, Pandua, West Bengal; Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, Kichaucha, Uttar Pradesh; Hussam ad-Din Manikpuri (Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh) Faqruddin Faqr Dehlvi, Mehrauli, New Delhi; Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh; Shafruddin Ali Ahmed and Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Chirag Dilli, New Delhi; Zainuddin Shirazi, Burhanpur, Madhya Pradesh; Muhiuddin Yousuf Yahya Madani Chishti, Medina; Kaleemullah Dehlvi Chishti, Delhi; Nizamuddin Aurangabadi; Nizamuddin Hussain, and Meerza Agha Mohammad; Muhammad Sulman Taunswi, Pakistan, Mohammad Meera Hussaini, Hesamuddin Mankpuri, Mian Shah Mohammad Shah, Hoshiarpur, Punjab, India, Mian Ali Mohammad Khan, Pakpattan, Pakistan. Khuwaja Noman Nayyir Kulachvi (Khalifa e Majaz) Kulachi, Pakistan, Khalifa Omer Tarin Chishti-Nizami Ishq Nuri, Qalandarabad, Pakistan.

===Branches===
The Chisti order branched out with Nizamuddin Auliya to form the Chisti Nizami order. A parallel branch which started with Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, another disciple of Baba Farid, was the Chisti Sabiri branch. People started adding Nizami gracefully after their name. He spiritually made many great Sufis amongst his students, descendants and the Sufis of the Nizami order.

The branches of the Chisti Nizami order are as follows:

====Naseeria====
His disciple Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli started the Nizamia Naseeria branch.

====Hussainia====
The Hussainia branch is named for Syed Muhammad Kamaluddin Hussaini Gisudaraz Bandanawaz. He was the most famous and loved disciple of Nasiruddin Muhammad Chirag-e-Dehli. The khanqah he established in Gulbarga, Karnataka, is still in existence.

Fakhri
The &quot;Fakhri&quot; branch is named for Muhib Un Nabi Maulana Fakhr Ud Din Fakhr E Jahan Dehlvi, peer o murshid of Shah Niyaz Be Niyaz.

====Niyazi====

Shah Niyaz Ahmad Barelvi, in the 19th century started the Niyazi branch.

====Serajia====
The Nizamia Serajia branch was started by Serajuddin Aqi Seraj. This branch is also known as Chistia Serajia.

====Ashrafia====
The Chistia Ashrafia branch was started by Ashraf Jahangir Semnani. He established a khanqah, still in existence at Kichaucha sharif, Uttar Pradesh, India.

====Faridia====
The Chistia Serajia Faridia order was started by Fariduddin Tavaelabukhsh, a descendant of Nizamuddin Auliya and a Sufi of the Serajia branch of the Chisti order. This branch is also known as Nizamia Serajia Faridia.

===Ishq-Nuri===
The Ishq Nuri order, branch of the main Chishti- Nizami, was founded by Shaikh Khwaja Khalid Mahmood Chishti sahib, in Lahore, Pakistan, in the 1960s. It is the most contemporary expression of this traditional Sufi lineage. It is mostly found in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, although now some followers are also to be found in the West.

Lutfia
Silsila Chishtia-Nizamia-Lutfia was continued by Moulana Lutfullah Shah Dankouri. The disciples of this silsila are found in Pakistan, India, England, Canada and USA.

==During the short reign of Qutbu&#x27;d-Din Mubarak Shah ==
During the last years of Alauddin Khalji&#x27;s life, the intrigues of Malik Kafur deprived Khizr Khan of succeeding legitimately to the throne. Malik Kafur had Khizr Khan blinded and Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah (1316–20), another claimant to the throne, narrowly escaped death. When Mubarak Shah ascended the throne he had Khizr Khan and the latter&#x27;s brothers executed. Shaikh Nizamu&#x27;d-Din took no interest in political upheavals but could not escape the brunt of Sultan Mubarak Shah&#x27;s fury for having made Khizr Khan his disciple. Speaking disparagingly of the Shaikh he began to hatch schemes against him. He prohibited his nobles from visiting Ghiyaspur. Mubarak Shah also constructed a mosque, the Masjid-i Miri, Where all the Sufis and &#x27;ulama&#x27; were ordered to perform their prayers. The Shaikh refused to comply with the Sultan&#x27;s orders, remonstrating that the mosque in his neighborhood had a greater claim on him.

On the first day of each month, the entire religious community of Delhi, gathered at the palace to offer congratulations prayer to the Sultan. The Shaikh further angered the Sultan by sending a servant as his delegate. The Sultan threatened the Shaikh with serious consequences if he personally failed to pay homage. Refusing to heed the threat, the Shaikh quietly prayed at his mother&#x27;s tomb and returned to his jama&#x27;at-khana. As the last day of the month approached, the capital was filled with anxiety, while the Shaikh himself remained calm. But the first day of the next month did not come for the Sultan. He was assassinated on the first night of Jumada II, 720/8 July 1320 by his favorite and protege, Khusraw Khan Barwar, who was later overthrown by Ghazi Malik who later came to be known as Ghiyasuddin Tughluq.

<text>Poplar Forest is a plantation and retreat home in Forest, Virginia, United States, that belonged to Thomas Jefferson, Founding Father and third U.S. president. Jefferson inherited the property in 1773 and began designing and working on his retreat home in 1806. While Jefferson is the most famous individual associated with the property, it had several owners before being purchased for restoration, preservation, and exhibition in 1984.

Poplar Forest was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1971 and is now operated as a historic house museum by the nonprofit Corporation for Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest. The corporation is also responsible for the ongoing archaeological study and restoration work at the property. The Corporation celebrated the completed restoration of Jefferson&#x27;s villa retreat in April 2023. 

==History==
The land upon which Poplar Forest was built shows archaeological evidence of having been populated by native peoples from the Paleo-Indian through Late Woodland periods. The 4,000-acre property was legally defined by a 1745 patent in which William Stith (a colonial minister and planter) assumed ownership, but did not live on the land. He passed ownership to his daughter Elizabeth Pasteur who sold it to her cousin Peter Randolph, who maintained ownership until 1764. John Wayles purchased the original property in 1764 and slowly added an additional 819 acres prior to 1770; he was the first to use slave labor on the property. Similar to Stith, Wayles did not live on the property due to his career as an attorney and businessman in Charles City County, Virginia.

Wayles&#x27; daughter Martha Wayles Skelton was married to Thomas Jefferson, and the couple inherited the full 4,819 acres when Wayles died in 1773. The Jeffersons did not immediately continue developing Poplar Forest, nor were they frequent visitors to the property – their focus was on developing Monticello, Thomas&#x27;s political and legal career, and raising their family. Martha Jefferson died in 1782, and Thomas spent time away from Virginia in public service following her death, serving as Minister to France (1785–1789), Secretary of State (1790–1793), Vice President (1797–1801), and President (1801–1809).

Even in Jefferson&#x27;s absence, the plantation was generating revenue from slave labor under the watch of a general steward and a team of overseers; the slave labor force at Poplar Forest produced annual tobacco and wheat crops after 1790.

Jefferson conducted annual visits to Poplar Forest beginning in 1810 and ending in 1823; He frequently brought his granddaughters Ellen and Cornelia Jefferson Randolph to the house after 1816, and always traveled to Poplar Forest with a small cadre of enslaved men and women who were based at Monticello. His visits ranged from a few days to weeklong stays. Jefferson maintained sole ownership of the property and the slaves until 1790, when he gave 1,000 acres and six slave families to his daughter Martha and her husband Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. Randolph would later divide and sell the rest of Jefferson&#x27;s landholdings; he also sold many of Jefferson&#x27;s enslaved persons to repay debts.

Near the end of his life, Jefferson sought to find permanent residents for the property, and his grandson Francis W. Eppes and wife Mary Elizabeth moved to Poplar Forest shortly after their 1823 marriage. Jefferson died in 1826 having made his last visit to Poplar Forest in 1823. The Eppeses sold Poplar Forest in November 1828 to William Cobbs; Cobbs assigned the task of managing the property to his son-in-law Edward Hutter in 1840 following his marriage to Cobb&#x27;s daughter Emma. The period from 1745 to 1840, in which Poplar Forest was sold many times in quick succession many enslaved men, women, and children were separated from their families as the owners settled their predecessor&#x27;s debts. The Cobbs–Hutter family maintained ownership of Poplar Forest into the twentieth century. The Hutter&#x27;s son Christian purchased the property in the late nineteenth century and used it as a summer home and working farm into the 1940s employing labor from both black and white hired farmhands and tenant farmers.
Christian Hutter sold the property to James Watts’ family in 1946; the Watts family operated Poplar Forest as a dairy farm and worked with Phelps Barnum and W. Stuart Thompson to restore the house to the way it appeared during Jefferson&#x27;s time. They also did significant landscape development, and sold a majority of the remaining land to a developer who constructed a nine-hole golf course and a lake along the eastern and southern part of the property.

Dr. James Johnson purchased the house and 50 acres of land from the Watts family in 1980 and then the nonprofit Corporation for Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest purchased the acreage and the remaining physical structures on the property in 1984. The organization has worked in recent years to reacquire land within the original plantation boundaries, and as of 2008 owned 617 acres of the original property. The Corporation celebrated the completed restoration of Jefferson&#x27;s villa retreat in April 2023.

== Architectural design ==

When construction began at Poplar Forest in 1806, Jefferson was President of the United States. He supervised the construction from Washington, D.C. Thomas Jefferson was a self-taught architect known for his work at Monticello and the Virginia State Capitol; he frequently borrowed designs from classical sources, and was attracted to Palladio&#x27;s classical architecture in the Veneto as well as designs from 16th century France. Jefferson designed Poplar Forest as his personal retreat house and selected the property because of its distance from his public life.

The octagonal house may have been the first of its kind to have been built in the United States. The house at Poplar Forest is made of brick and has an octagonal floor plan; it consists of a central square space and three sides made of elongated octagon rooms. There is an entry hall on the one side of the house, which is two smaller rooms divided by a short entry hall. There is a skylight in the central dining room. The dining room dimensions are 20’ x 20’ x 20’, which makes it a perfect cube. Jefferson also added pedimented porticoes on low arcades that were attached to both the northern and southern facades as well as the east and west stairwells. Scholars agree that the retreat house at Poplar Forest is an excellent example of octagonal symmetry; Jefferson&#x27;s design for the building reflects a consistent geometric approach likely made possible by his well-known proficiency in algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and Newtonian calculus.

==Post-Jeffersonian modifications and preservation==

Under different owners, the main house underwent many alterations, and the plantation&#x27;s acreage was incrementally reduced to 50 acres (20 ha) at the time of acquisition by the Corporation for Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest. There was a fire in 1845; the Cobbs and Hutter families rebuilt in the Greek revival style and added an attic story for sleeping; this modified the interior plan of the house. The original walls, chimney, and columns remained after the renovation.

The Corporation for Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest used early 19th-century building materials including heavy timber-frame construction, hemp sash cord, and iron hardware from Colonial Williamsburg. They also used 19th-century building techniques, such as column rendering and burning limestone to produce traditional lime mortar and plaster, for their restoration work. The goal of the restorations is to restore Poplar Forest to Jefferson&#x27;s original architectural vision.

== Slavery ==
Enslaved men, women, and children were present on the property from 1766 through 1865, when slavery was formally abolished in the United States. Present-day knowledge of the enslaved populations and their contributions to Poplar Forest is based on both archaeological and archival evidence. John Wayles used slave labor to originally develop roadwork on the property, and when Thomas and Martha Jefferson inherited the land that included Poplar Forest from Wayles, they also inherited 135 enslaved men, women, and children as well as other tracts of land in Amherst, Cumberland, Charles City, Goochland, and Powhatan counties. Because Wayles chose to split his estate among several heirs, enslaved families were separated in order for his heirs to pay his debts.


As Jefferson turned more attention to Poplar Forest, he brought enslaved people from Monticello, Elk Hill, Indian Camp, and Judith&#x27;s Creek, thus increasing the enslaved population at Poplar Forest. Jefferson kept consistent records of the enslaved people living at Poplar Forest; these records show that the enslaved population fluctuated between as few as 28 and as many as 95 enslaved individuals were working at Poplar Forest between the years 1774 and 1819. As an active participant in the slave trade, Jefferson sold and purchased enslaved people throughout the time he owned Poplar Forest, including the sale of 40 enslaved people from his various properties in Bedford County, Virginia in the 1790s. The Eppeses inherited the house, about 1,075 acres of land, and several enslaved men and women after Jefferson&#x27;s death in 1826. The Cobbs and Hutter families also used slave labor on the property through emancipation and maintained some formerly enslaved people as hired workers following.

=== Plantation and slave economics ===
Beginning in 1790, the enslaved community at Poplar Forest grew tobacco and livestock for profit, and later grew wheat. Records from Edward Hutter&#x27;s tenure at Poplar Forest show that enslaved individuals were regularly tasked with tilling fields and digging ditches in addition to their work growing and harvesting plants to be sold at market. Enslaved people worked six days each week, and were also responsible for constructing and maintaining their housing structures. Scholars have determined that the enslaved community at Poplar Forest devised a commerce system amongst themselves; enslaved persons were allowed a small plot of land on which to grow food, producing goods that could be traded or sold to fellow enslaved people as well as the owners&#x27; families and the outside market. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest have uncovered clothing accessories such as buttons, glass beads, gilt chains, aiglet/lace tips, and fancy buckles that were likely used as currency amongst enslaved people at Poplar Forest and the surrounding plantations.

Documents from the 19th century show that the transition from tobacco-based to mixed-crop plantation agriculture left Poplar Forest with an abundance of laborers; William Cobbs, in particular, is known to have hired out enslaved people from the plantation to external projects. Other enslaved individuals (including two women named Lucy and Matilda) are known to have had access to money during this time so that they could buy items on behalf of the Cobbs/Hutter families. Edward Hutter regularly leased slaves from Poplar Forest to businesses and planters in Bedford County.

=== Family networks ===
Records show that by the 1790s, there were seven different enslaved families represented at Poplar Forest. Jefferson encouraged common-law unions amongst the enslaved community, and recorded the birth dates of each enslaved child born on the property. He also rewarded women who married a fellow slave from Poplar Forest with a pot; archaeologists have found remnants of these gifts in archaeological studies of the property. Jefferson kept records of family connections – surviving records have allowed scholars to conclude that multiple generations of single families were enslaved at Poplar Forest and had relatives at other plantations in Virginia. William and Marian Cobbs inherited an enslaved family that included Mary and her daughters Lucy and Matilda (who are recorded to have worked as house slaves) as well as other siblings and extended family members.

=== Known enslaved people ===
* Hannah was not born at Poplar Forest, but served there from the time she was a teenager until ca.1821. She married and had a family with a fellow slave, was literate, and worked for a time as Jefferson&#x27;s housekeeper.
* James (Jame) Hubbard was purchased by Jefferson when he was 30 and went on to oversee field laborers at Poplar Forest. He fathered six children with a fellow slave named Cate and fostered several others, and worked as a hogkeeper when he was older. Scholars are also able to trace his family members and their roles at Poplar Forest, which included Nace, Hannah, Nancy, Joan, James, and Phill.
* Phill was born at Poplar Forest to James Hubbard and his wife Cate. Phill briefly worked at Monticello before returning to Poplar Forest, where he married Hanah and had a son. He died at age 33, reportedly of poisoning.
* William (Billy) was born at Poplar Forest and violently rebelled against slavery by attacking an overseer on more than one occasion. Jefferson sent him and three others to Louisiana, where William attempted to run away, but was caught and sold.
* John Hemmings never lived at Poplar Forest, but documentary records show that he was responsible for much of the interior woodwork in the retreat house at Poplar Forest.
* Lydia Johnson lived at Poplar Forest when Edward Hutter owned the property. She named one of her children Ida Reeder, after Hutter&#x27;s niece; expense records show that he purchased a dress for her as a gift. Lydia continued to work for the family after Emancipation until she died in 1919.
* Will appears in a ledger from 1772 noting that he purchased rum, buttons, thread, and cloth.

== Archaeology ==
There have been several archaeological digs at Poplar Forest since the archaeology program began in 1989. Archaeology has revealed several sites associated with the enslaved population at Poplar Forest as well as uncovered valuable information about Jefferson&#x27;s original landscape surrounding his retreat. In Fall of 2022, Poplar Forest celebrated the completion of landscape restoration to the north side of the retreat villa.

More recent excavations focused on an area believed to have held paper mulberry trees; Jefferson planted two rows in order to help create naturalistic wings to complement the Palladian style of his retreat house. Archaeologists at Poplar Forest found stains in the ground indicating areas in which trees were previously planted, and their goal is to analyze the levels of charcoal and pollen to determine which areas were most likely the original location(s) for the paper mulberry trees. Other ongoing and future excavation plans include the area surrounding an antebellum slave cabin as well as Jefferson&#x27;s ornamental plant nursery.

=== Slave sites ===
Archaeological excavations of Poplar Forest have yielded evidence suggesting that maps of Poplar Forest created in Jefferson&#x27;s time were incomplete and did not illustrate the extent to which enslaved people were present.

==== Old plantation/North Hill site ====
The Old Plantation/North Hill is believed to have been established in the 1770s/1780s and was the site of the oldest slave farm structures at Poplar Forest dating from 1764. Maps suggest that the original structures included an overseer&#x27;s house, large barn, and slave housing built over the course of 40 years. Scholars also refer to this area as the Old Quarter located to the south and west of the main house.

==== Quarter site ====
The Quarter site, also called the Wingo quarter farm, dates from 1790 to 1812 at Poplar Forest and was operational when Jefferson owned Poplar Forest; he gave the land on which it was located to Martha and Thomas Mann Randolph as a wedding present. Jefferson&#x27;s surviving notes tell us that three carpenters were able to construct a slave cabin in three days and that the slaves most often lived next to their field or shop work sites. Documentary evidence suggests that the slave housing structures at Poplar Forest were made of logs and that several houses had two rooms that each measured 12.5 x 15 feet; this is corroborated by archaeological evidence suggesting that the slave structures contained root cellars designed by the occupants, which were used to store clothing, tools, and iron hardware. Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postholes; this analysis also yielded fragments of glass, ceramics, and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots.

One other structure discovered is believed to have functioned as a smokehouse as well as a residence, while a third is believed to have been built later than the other two, and used primarily as housing. Soil analysis also suggests that there were fences in the slave quarters.

Excavations at this site also yielded a number of objects related to slave life at Poplar Forest. Archaeologists discovered iron saw files, gimlets, wedges, croze irons, and a hinge from a folding ruler; it is likely that these objects are from tools used by slaves either in their work assignments or in their personal space. Scissors, straight pins, and thimbles found at the site suggest that women sewed for both work and for their families. The excavations uncovered stoneware and earthenware that scholars believe to have been used to prepare food. Enslaved men and women at Poplar Forest ate fruits and vegetables as well as beef, pork, venison, opossum, rabbit, chicken, turkey, and fish, and possibly had access to firearms with which to hunt animals.

==== Site A ====
This is the newest of the three sites; current scholarship indicates that it was built in the 1830s and was operational until emancipation. Scholars believe that the site was home to a slave cabin likely occupied between 1840 and 1860. Archaeologists have uncovered a 3 ft. pit that would have been located underneath the floor of the cabin, postholes, and remnants of a shone chimney. The excavation at Site A has yielded buttons, straight pins, needles, thimbles, and the bone cap of a needle case; this suggests that this site may have been the home of a seamstress.

In addition, 191 beads have been recovered, with only one made of bone, and the rest from glass. 159 were seed beads, most predominantly found in aqua, turquoise, red and white cased, and white. Though five single beads in dark blue, light blue, black, dark green, and purple were also uncovered, as well as two light green, and four colorless seed beads. The residual thirty one beads were crafted from different glass bead making methods, and were found in three colors. Twenty six were wound glass in black, three were faceted, two black and one purple, and two drawn glass in white.

A Spanish half real had also been excavated, pierced at the top. Beginning in 1765, Spanish reales were standard currency in Virginia, and were considered legal tender from 1793 to 1857 in the United States as a whole. Though, considering the recovered half zeal was found altered, it suggests that the zeal was worn as an adornment object. Historically, both pierced and unpiered coins were worn for protection and security by enslaved African Americans.

== Present day ==
&quot;The Corporation for Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest&quot; has worked to restore Jefferson&#x27;s plantation and retreat home since 1984, when the tax-exempt non-profit organization purchased 50 acres of land and the original buildings with the goal of preserving the estate for public educational benefit. The corporation operates Poplar Forest as a historic house museum with the mission to preserve, inspire, and tell the emerging story of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Poplar Forest.

Poplar Forest first welcomed visitors in 1986, and now conducts guided tours thematically dedicated to the main retreat house and the enslaved community in addition to its ongoing restoration and archaeological work. The property is a National Historic Landmark and designated a Virginia History Trails site as part of Virginia&#x27;s 2019 Commemoration.

<doc id="517441" wikidata="Q651162" url="?curid=517441" title="Lake Mweru Wantipa">
<text>Lake Mweru Wantipa or Mweru-wa-Ntipa meaning &quot;muddy lake&quot; (also called &#x27;Mweru Marsh&#x27;) is a lake and swamp system in the Northern Province of Zambia. It has been regarded in the past as something of mystery, displaying fluctuations in water level and salinity which were not entirely explained by variation in rainfall levels; it has been known to dry out almost completely. This is compounded by its remoteness and it not receiving the same attention from geographers and geologists as its larger and more accessible neighbours, Lake Tanganyika, 25 km east, and Lake Mweru, 40 km west, with which its name is sometimes confused.
Lake Mweru Wantipa is a rift valley lake lying in a branch of the East African Rift, running from the Luapula River to Lake Tanganyika. There are some hot springs characteristics of a rift valley to the east. Its water is muddy in appearance, at times appearing reddish and &#x27;slightly oily&#x27;. In the local dialect &quot;wa ntipa&quot; means &quot;with mud&quot;, hence &quot;Mweru Wantipa&quot; distinguishes it from its bigger neighbour, Lake Mweru, which has clearer water.

==Sources and drainage==
Rivers and streams, none very large, flow into Lake Mweru Wantipa and its swamps from the Mporokoso plateau about 32 km south, and the hills to the north-east in DR Congo. It was thought to drain via its south-western swamps and a dambo called the Mofwe into the Kalungwishi River, which flows into Lake Mweru. However, at the junction of the Kalungwishi and the Mofwe, the elevation is 942 m but the surface of the lake is at only 932 m. It is evident that the Kalungwishi overflows in the rainy season into Mweru Wantipa, but perhaps not vice versa, though one report in 1931 after very heavy rains reported a flood from the Mofwe into the Kalungwishi. Most of the time, though, Mweru Wantipa has no outlet and forms an isolated river basin.

==Lake extent==
Around 2005, Lake Mweru Wantipa&#x27;s main north-east to south-west axis was about 65 km long and it was about 20 km wide, but a narrow branch extends roughly 30 km east from the northern end, giving a surface area of about 1500 km². In the south-east at Kampinda, a peninsula divides off a swampy inlet containing the Chimbwe Pools and a lagoon called Lake Cheshi. However at various times in the recent past it has been reported to be not a lake but a swamp with hardly any open water surface, and even to be a plain of dried out mud (littered with fish scales and bones, and the skeletons of dead crocodiles and hippos). These variations in open water surface occur not just within a single dry and rainy season cycle, but over years or decades. For instance it was reported as being a lake in 1890, 1897, 1911, 1919 and 1938, but a swamp in 1892, 1900–11, 1912–19, and 1922; and as having dried out around 1916. Its greatest depth has been reported as 5 m, but at times may be less than 1 m deep over most of its surface.

The salinity also shows long term variation, it was reported as being freshwater in 1929 and 1939, but saline in 1949.

==Factors determining water level and salinity==
While rainfall is the main factor, this may not be the complete story. Blockage of the Mofwe and of the rivers draining into Mweru Wantipa by papyrus and the growth of rushes may be part of the answer. It may also be that the effects of dry years may be delayed for a few years by the release of groundwater from surrounding hills into dambos which flow into the lake.

==Natural resources and environmental pressures==
Lake Mweru Wantipa&#x27;s fishery has been productive in the past but has been depleted in recent years. The lake supports a large population of hippopotamus and crocodiles. Except for birds and waterfowl, the wildlife on land and in the marshes, once extensive, has been reduced despite the existence of the Mweru Wantipa National Park. The park lies mainly on the lake&#x27;s western shore but covers the lake surface, much of the marshes and part of the southern shore. The lake is only a few kilometres from the DR Congo border on its northern side and wars and conflicts in that country have caused many thousands of refugees to enter the district at Kaputa, putting pressure on resources. Most of the refugees have been moved to camps in Kawambwa and Mporokoso districts before repatriation.

==Settlements and roads==
The main centre of population on the lake is the town of Kaputa, which also forms an administrative district of the Northern Province.

At one time the principal road serving the lake was the one from Mporokoso to its south-east shore where there was a ferry at Bulaya, but that has deteriorated and now the main highway is the one from Lake Mweru along the western and northern shores to Kaputa.

<text>Horary astrology is an ancient branch of horoscopic astrology in which an astrologer attempts to answer a question by constructing a horoscope for the exact time at which the question was received and understood by the astrologer.

The answer to the horary question might be a simple yes or no, but is generally more complex with insights into, for example, the motives of the questioners, the motives of others involved in the matter, and the options available to them.

==Method==
Horary astrology, as a system of divination, relies on principles consistent with broader astrological methods, but with some techniques unique to the branch. Unlike in natal astrology, where the chart represents one person&#x27;s life, the horary chart represents factors unique to as specific situation, including objects and other people.

The person asking the question, or &quot;querent,&quot; is represented by the ruler of the sign the first house cusp falls on in the horoscope. The position of and aspects to the Moon are of prime importance, with the Moon often representing the querent. Planetary aspects to the house cusps are considered more important than in other branches of astrology, although planetary rulers of the houses tend to take precedence in analysis. Other key elements used in horary astrology include the lunar nodes, the planetary antiscia, the fixed stars and the Arabic parts.

Typically, a horary chart is read by first assigning the thing asked about, the &quot;quesited&quot;, to a particular house in the chart. For instance, if asking &quot;where is my lost dog?&quot;, the dog would be represented by the sixth house, as it is the house that governs small animals (traditionally, smaller than a goat).

The house cusp of the sixth house will be in a particular sign, for example Libra. Libra is ruled by Venus, so Venus is considered the &quot;significator&quot; of the lost dog. Venus&#x27;s state in the horoscope will give clues to the animal&#x27;s wellbeing, and its placement will give indications related to its location. Applying astrological aspects between the planet(s) representing the querent and those representing the quesited will indicate those two things coming together in the future.

===Assigning houses===
Horary astrologers use many different house systems, but in contemporary horary astrology the Regiomontanus house system is commonly used, following influential early modern horary astrologer William Lilly.

Understanding the correct house for the context of the question is pivotal to the correct interpretation of a horary question. In astrological theory, everything can be assigned to a house, and it is to that house, and its planetary ruler, that the assignation of the quesited is derived. Whatever planet is ruling the sign on the cusp of the house is taken to signify the quesited. For example, if the horary is about matters pertaining to career, the ruler of the tenth house, the house for careers and jobs, will indicate the quesited.

A short, non-exhaustive, list of possible associations with houses follows:

:The First House
::The querent (person asking the question). The querent&#x27;s physical appearance, temperament, and mental state.

:The Second House
::The querent&#x27;s finances, wealth, and material and financial possessions. Considered to represent moveable possessions as opposed to immovable possessions. Allies of the querent, such as lawyers in court cases.

:The Third House
::Siblings and neighbors. General comings and goings and short journeys and travels. Letters, emails and paperwork, including communications and contracts. Lower education such as elementary through to high school. Cars may be second or third depending on the context of the question.

:The Fourth House
::Parents. Immovable possessions as opposed to movable possessions, such as houses, gardens, and orchards. Mines, oil, buried treasure and anything which comes from the ground.

:The Fifth House
::Children, love affairs, romance, sex (pleasure and procreation). Gambling, speculation, arguments, games and pleasure. Any venue that caters to pleasures or provide entertainment including restaurants, clubs, bars and music venues.

:The Sixth House
::Illness and disease or sickness. Servants, or employees in contemporary horary astrology, including contractors. Pets and small animals, traditionally animals smaller than a goat (larger animals are twelfth house). Work and work environment. People with whom you work together in some kind of agreement.

:The Seventh House
::Marriage, partners and partnerships — both business and personal. Competitors and opponents of all kinds. Open enemies, as in enemies that you are aware of (hidden enemies are the twelfth house). If no other house suffices, use the seventh house to represent any other person.

:The Eighth House
::Death, fears, anxiety. Commonly used to indicate other people&#x27;s money (see turning the chart below).

:The Ninth House
::Long distance travel, including travel to unknown locations. Foreigners and foreign lands. Universities and students of any subject of higher education such as doctors, lawyers, priests and astrologers. Visions, dreams and religion, as well as churches and philosophies. Books. Pilgrimages or journeys for spiritual or religious reasons.

:The Tenth House
::Career and persons of authority. Heads of state, the government generally, judges and royalty. Commonly used to indicate property belonging to a partner or opponent (see turning the chart below).

:The Eleventh House
::Friendships or groups. Wishes, hopes and aspirations.

:The Twelfth House
::Secrets, hidden motives and enemies, captivity, imprisonment and self-undoing. Things not yet known to the querent. Any form of non-voluntary bondage or captivity, monasteries, being voluntary and religious are ninth house. Traditionally associated with witchcraft, or any manner of secretly undermining the querent.

====Turning the chart====
&quot;Turning the chart&quot; is a technique to combine house significations, commonly to identify topics or things related to people who are not the querent. This is done by first selecting the house for the other person, and taking that house as if it was the first house of that person, and counting outwards. For example, to identify the house that represents the siblings of the querent&#x27;s father, first start from the fourth house (which represents the querent&#x27;s parents), then count to the third house (siblings) from the fourth house, resulting in the sixth house.

In this manner the sixth house (third from the fourth), in addition to its natural meaning, may also be used for any brothers and sisters of the father. In a horary question about, for example, the querent&#x27;s aunt or uncle, the sixth house could then be used. Turned houses are called &quot;derived&quot; houses, as opposed to the normal &quot;radical&quot; houses.

===Interpretation===
Fundamental to horary astrology interpretation are the concepts of planetary dignity and reception. Planetary dignity is in two forms, essential and accidental. Essential dignity refers to the quality of a planet at a particular degree of the zodiac, and its ability to express its inherent nature. Accidental dignity refers to non-zodiac related factors that the planet is in. For example, if the planet is in a traditionally bad house (6th, 8th, or 12th) in the chart, if it is retrograde, aspected by malefic planet (Saturn or Mars), combust, or subject to various other factors, then it is considered an accidental debility and circumstantially hindered.

Reception refers to how each planet in a horary question chart views, or &quot;receives&quot;, another planet, either favourably, unfavourably, or somewhere in between. This is determined by the zodiacal placement of the planets in question. For example, if Mars is in Taurus, and Venus is in Scorpio, then each of the planets is in the sign the other planet rules. This is called mutual reception by rulership, and although each planet is in its detriment, it nevertheless receives the other planet favourably. In some horary questions, reception is used to delineate if different factors involved in the question are able to &quot;receive&quot; or interact with each other.

One factor of horary astrology is called the &quot;radicality&quot; of the chart. Some astrologers believe that they should avoid further judgment if a horary chart does not meet specific criteria. This rule is sometimes criticized by modern horary astrologers, such as John Frawley in his &quot;Horary Textbook&quot;, who states that the traditional rules of radicality should be ignored, while other astrologers continue to use them.

<text>James Robert Wilson, (September 16, 1866 – April 3, 1941) was a Canadian politician.

Born in Almonte, Canada West, he moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan in 1884 and was employed at a grocery and hardware store. During the 1885 North-West Rebellion he led the first medical corps to Saskatoon. After the rebellion he worked as a farmer, before opening a general store in Saskatoon in 1896.

In January 1903 he was elected overseer over the village of Saskatoon, and when on July 1 of that year the village was incorporated as a town, he became its first mayor. He served until 1904, and again later as mayor of the by now city of Saskatoon from 1907 to 1908. He also sat on the city council from 1914 to 1919.

In his times as mayor he personally guaranteed a bank loan that allowed for the completion of sewer, water and electrical works, and it was also whilst he was mayor that Saskatoon&#x27;s City Park was purchased.

Wilson also tried his hand at national politics, standing unsuccessfully as a federal candidate for the Conservatives in 1908, before managing to be elected in 1917. He served for four years, including a spell as a cabinet minister, before being defeated in 1921.

His brother Russell also served as mayor of Saskatoon.

Wilson Crescent, which runs through Saskatoon&#x27;s Avalon, Adelaide/Churchill and Nutana Park neighbourhoods, is named in James Wilson&#x27;s honour.

<text>Newent (; originally called &quot;Noent&quot;) is a market town and civil parish in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England. The town is north-west of Gloucester. Its population was 5,073 at the 2001 census, rising to 5,207 in 2011, The population was 6,777 at the 2021 Census. Once a medieval market and fair town, its site had been settled at least since Roman times. The first written record of it appears in the 1086 Domesday Book.

==Etymology==
Noent, Newent&#x27;s original name, may have meant &quot;new place&quot; in Celtic. It also may mean &quot;new inn&quot;, referring to lodgings for travellers to Wales, according to John Leland (c. 1503–1552), who mentioned a house called &quot;New Inn&quot;, later named &quot;The Boothall&quot;, which provided lodging along the road to Wales. There was indeed such a house in Lewall Street, owned by members of the Richardson family in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Lewall Street runs between High Street and Court Lane, north of Broad Street.

==Geography==
Situated only 3 miles (4 km) east of the Herefordshire border, Newent is on the northern edge of the Forest of Dean, within the Forest of Dean District of Gloucestershire. and south-east of the River Wye. The river was connected via Newent to Gloucester in the late 18th century by the 34-mile Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal.

==History==
===Romano-British period===
A Roman road was laid between Newent and Ariconium, near what is now Ross-on-Wye. Within of Newent, there were several metal-working sites used by the Romans. Further evidence of Romano-British settlement occurs at 56 sites within of the town. Archaeological finds there include Roman coins and pottery near the town itself, Roman coins and treasure at Little Gorsley, and a settlement at Dymock.

===Medieval period===
The priory established in Newent was a cell of Cormeilles Abbey, founded in Normandy in 1060 by William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford. The abbey received an endowment from him that included the manor of Newent and surrounding woods, the church and its income, and other property he owned in England. The once Benedictine priory became part of the college of Fotheringhay after the suppression of alien priories during the Hundred Years&#x27; War with France. Its site is now occupied by the Court House, adjacent to the parish church.

The Domesday Book records that in 1066 the lord of Noemt (Newent) had been Edward the Confessor. Twenty years later the tenant-in-chief and one of the lords was Cormeilles Abbey. Other lords were Durand of Gloucester (brother of Roger de Pitres) and William son of Baderon (William fitzBaderon).

Newent, with 34.5 households, was located within the Botloe Hundred of Gloucestershire. There were 10 villagers, 19 smallholders, four serfs and one reeve. There were also four lord&#x27;s plough teams, 19 men&#x27;s plough teams, and three mills.

Henry III approved an annual fair in 1226 and additionally allowed for a weekly market, which began in 1253. The town still has a half-timbered market house.

===St Mary&#x27;s===
The Church of England Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a Grade I listed building located in Church Street. It dates from the 13th century, but the site had been occupied since the Anglo-Saxon period.

St Mary&#x27;s has stained glass windows from the famed company of Clayton and Bell. Set on a tower with a ring of eight bells is an spire. The church organ was built in 1737 by Thomas Warne, a resident of the town.

===19th century===
In 1848, Newent had a population of 3,099, of whom 1,454 people lived in the town itself. This was fewer than in earlier periods. There were mineral springs near the canal.

The Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal between Gloucester and Ledbury closed on 30 June 1881 and the section between Ledbury and Gloucester was converted into a railway line. The line opened on 27 July 1885 as a branch of the Great Western Railway. It closed in 1959, but the canal is now being restored.)

===Survivals===

Newent&#x27;s many historical buildings include a stilted Market House and several other black-and-white, half-timbered buildings typical of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. Behind Church Street, an erstwhile museum of Victorian life called the Shambles took the form of a replica 19th-century street. The shops are now occupied by real traders.

Historic England lists over 50 town-centre buildings and monuments, including most of Church Street and the Devonia in High Street, a Grade II-listed house of the Georgian period. The early 18th-century Court House, standing in a small park by the parish church, occupies the site of the ancient priory and is reputed to contain its foundations. Its historic features include a fine Rococo plaster ceiling and several completely panelled rooms. It was restored by R. V. Morris, Chairman of Gloucester Civic Trust.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station is away at Ledbury on the Cotswold Line. Bus routes through the town connect it to Ross, Ledbury and Gloucester, such as the 32 Gloucester–Ross-on-Wye route.

Newent used to be served by Newent railway station on the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway, which opened in 1885, opposite what is now the fire station. It was closed to passengers in 1959 and for freight traffic in 1964. The buttresses of the Station Bridge can be seen in Old Station Road.

==Outdoor attractions==
Newent is near a National Birds of Prey Centre, just east of the neighbouring village of Cliffords Mesne, and a vineyard, the Three Choirs. It is at the centre of the Golden Triangle, so-called after the daffodils in the surrounding area.

The town&#x27;s Onion Fayre included competitions for growing onions and for eating them. It dated from 1996 as a revival of an agricultural fair suspended about the time of World War I. It claimed to be Gloucestershire&#x27;s largest free, one-day festival, with up to 15,000 visitors on the second Saturday in September. The fair was cancelled in 2022 after being unable to restore support after it was not held for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==The arts==
The town is home to an orchestra, founded in 1940, a choral society, and several other amateur musical and performing groups.

Traditionally, May Day was celebrated by morris dancing on the summit of nearby May Hill at dawn, after which the dancers would process into Newent. Between 2007 and 2014, a Joe Meek festival was held in venues around the town. Artist Paul Nash took a collection of photographs around Carswalls Farm, Upleadon, Newent in the late 1930s or early 1940s that are held in the archives of the Tate.

==Education==
Education commissioners in the reign of Edward VI (1547–53) noted the lack of schooling in Newent, then a market town with over 500 inhabitants, but &quot;all the youth of a great distance there hence rudely brought up and in no manner of knowledge and learning, where were a place meet to... erect a school for the better and more godly bringing up of the same youth.&quot; Today&#x27;s Newent has three schools, two of them federated, all within the town. The federated Glebe Infant School and Picklenash Junior School provides primary education. Newent Community School offers secondary and tertiary education to those aged 11 and up.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill TV transmitter.

The town is served by both BBC Hereford &amp; Worcester and BBC Radio Gloucestershire. Other radio stations including Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, and Dean Radio, a community radio station with broadcast to the Forest of Dean.

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is &quot;The Forester&quot;.

<text>William Alan Finn (born February 28, 1952) is an American composer and lyricist. He is best known for his musicals, which include &quot;Falsettos&quot;, for which he won the 1992 Tony Awards for Best Original Score and Best Book of a Musical, &quot;A New Brain&quot; (1998), and &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot; (2005).

==Early life==
Finn was born in Boston, Massachusetts. He is Jewish, raised in conservative Judaism, and grew up in Natick, Massachusetts, with his parents and siblings, Michael and Nancy. He attended the Temple Israel in Natick, where his rabbi was Harold Kushner. In Hebrew School, Finn wrote his first play, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever told anyone this: The first play I ever wrote was in Hebrew. I have no idea what it was about. But it was horrible, I guarantee it. I couldn&#x27;t write plays, and I couldn&#x27;t really speak Hebrew, so how good could it be?&quot; While attending Natick High School, Finn competed with the Natick Speech Team and was in the drama department headed by Gerald Dyer. For his bar mitzvah, he received a guitar and taught himself to play.

He went on to attend Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, as a music major. He originally entered as a guitar major, &quot;When I got to college I kind of transferred to the piano. I transferred what I knew on the guitar to the piano. But when I was playing the guitar I was always writing my own songs — and singing a few of — I only had one book of folk songs, a blue book, of these sad, sad folk songs. ...I would start them the way they were written and then I would change them to how I wanted them... I would just use the lyrics — re-musicalize the lyrics.&quot; When he graduated, he received the Hutchinson Fellowship (a musical composition award).

==Career==
Finn is a heavily autobiographical writer; he always writes his own lyrics. His topics have included the gay and Jewish experiences in contemporary America, and also family, belonging, sickness, healing, and loss. According to a 2006 article, &quot;&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called him &#x27;the composer laureate of loss.&#x27;&quot;

Finn is especially noted for his work on what was to become a trilogy of short musicals Off-Broadway. &quot;In Trousers&quot;, &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot;, and &quot;Falsettoland&quot; all chronicle the lives of the character Marvin; his ex-wife, Trina; his boyfriend, Whizzer; his psychiatrist, Mendel; and his son, Jason. &quot;Falsettos&quot;, the combination of the latter two parts of his Marvin Trilogy (&quot;March of the Falsettos&quot; and &quot;Falsettoland&quot;), opened on Broadway at the John Golden Theater on April 29, 1992, and ran for 486 performances. It went on to garner seven nominations at the 46th Tony Awards, winning two: the 1992 Tony Award for Best Original Score as well as the 1992 Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical, the latter shared with James Lapine.

A critically acclaimed revival opened on September 29, 2016, at the Walter Kerr Theater and went on to garner five nominations at the 71st Tony Awards, including Best Revival.

With Lapine, Finn penned a musical loosely based on his near-death experience following brain surgery, exploring the role of music in his life and recovery. The musical&#x27;s main character is a man who has what may be a terminal arteriovenous malformation (AVM). Finn&#x27;s longtime partner, Arthur Salvadore, is represented by the character Roger Delli-Bovi. Finn&#x27;s mother is also present in the piece. That musical, &quot;A New Brain&quot;, starred Malcolm Gets, Kristin Chenoweth and Chip Zien, and premiered Off-Broadway at the Lincoln Center Theater in 1998. The musical won the 1999 Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway Musical. The UK premiere was at the 2005 Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

At the 2006 Elliot Norton Awards Ceremony, Finn brought his high school drama teacher, Gerry Dyer, onstage with him to present an award. Finn said of Dyer that he &quot;imbued us with a ridiculous sense of our own self-worth.&quot; Another student of Gerald Dyer, Alison Fraser, found fame on Broadway, collaborating with Finn in the original casts of &quot;In Trousers&quot; and &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot;.

Finn had another Broadway success with &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee&quot;, for which he wrote both music and lyrics. The show won two Tony Awards in 2005-one for Best Book of a Musical, and another for the Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical. It ran Off-Broadway, then on Broadway in 2005 and toured the United States in 2006. The show was first workshopped and produced at Barrington Stage Company (BSC) in Pittsfield, MA, where Finn later created The Musical Theatre Lab (MTL) with BSC Artistic Director Julianne Boyd. The MTL is an annual summer lab where emerging musical theatre artists are supported and new musical works are created, fine-tuned and produced under the curatorship of Finn and Boyd.

Three musical revues or song suites of Finn&#x27;s music have been produced:
* &quot;Infinite Joy&quot;, in which the composer played the piano and sang along with an all-star cast, contained several songs from shows that were unfinished, and some that were cut from previous shows.
* &quot;Elegies: A Song Cycle&quot; (2003) is a series of songs the composer wrote in memoriam of loved ones now gone, and in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.
* &quot;Make Me a Song&quot;, conceived and directed by Rob Ruggiero, premiered at Hartford&#x27;s Theaterworks in the summer of 2006, opened Off-Broadway in November 2007, and closed in December 2007 after 54 performances. A live recording was released by Sh-K-Boom Records on April 29, 2008.

Finn&#x27;s first show was called &quot;Sizzle&quot; and was produced at Williams College in the fall of 1971. Finn wrote the music and lyrics, and his good friend, Charlie Rubin, wrote the libretto. &quot;Sizzle&quot; was the first original musical produced on the Williams College campus since Stephen Sondheim attended the college over 20 years earlier. &quot;Sizzle&quot; was a coming of age musical about college students but concluded in an unusual way with the star of the show, played by J. Tyler Griffin, Jr., dying in an electric chair. &quot;Sizzle&quot; played to packed houses. Rubin possesses a reel-to-reel tape containing excerpts from the show, including most of the music.

Finn&#x27;s songs were featured exclusively on Lisa Howard&#x27;s album &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience&quot;, released on April 12, 2011.

The musical comedy &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot;, premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse, California, from February 15, 2011, through March 27, 2011. James Lapine wrote the book and is the director, set design by David Korins, staging by Lapine and Christopher Gattelli. The opening night cast featured Hunter Foster (Richard), Malcolm Gets (Frank), Dick Latessa (Grandpa), Taylor Trensch (Dwayne), Georgi James (Olive), and Jennifer Laura Thompson (Sheryl). The ensemble, who Jay Irwin wrote &quot;...took the small parts they were given and ran with them, almost right out of the theater as each of them brilliantly played the comedic relief to the family&#x27;s &quot;straight man&quot;&quot;, starred Bradley Dean, Carmen Ruby Floyd, Eliseo Roman, Andrew Samonsky, Sally Wilfert, and Zakiya Young.

&quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; began previews Off Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre in New York on October 15, 2013, and opened November 14, 2013.

Finn&#x27;s frequent collaborators include librettist James Lapine, director Graciela Daniele and singers/actors Stephen Bogardus, Carolee Carmello, Stephen DeRosa, Alison Fraser, Keith Byron Kirk, Norm Lewis, Michael Rupert, Mary Testa, Christian Borle and Chip Zien.

Finn was one of a selected few composers who contributed to the song cycle &quot;Stars of David&quot; which premiered in October 2012 at the Philadelphia Theatre Company. It was based on the Abigail Pogrebin&#x27;s book &quot;Stars of David: Prominent Jews Talk About Being Jewish&quot; and starred Nancy Balbirer, Alex Brightman, Joanna Glushak, Brad Oscar and Donna Vivino. Finn also contributed to the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Mama &amp; her Boys&quot;.

His long-in-development show, &quot;The Royal Family of Broadway&quot;, with a book by Richard Greenberg, is based on the play by George S. Kaufman and Edna Ferber, which tells the story of a girl from a family of great Broadway actors who contemplates leaving show business and getting married. It apparently had been shelved according to William Finn&#x27;s personal notes for &quot;Make Me a Song&quot;, &quot;Playbill&quot; magazine and an article from 2006. Notwithstanding, it saw its first full production in 2018 at the Barrington Stage Company with &quot;Putnam&quot; librettist Rachel Sheinkin penning the book.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Finn suffered deteriorating vision, dizziness and partial paralysis and was rushed to the hospital. He had arteriovenous malformation, or AVM, in his brain stem. In September 1992, he had Gamma Knife surgery, which obliterated the AVM. After the surgery, Finn experienced a year of humbled serenity and constantly felt like he had a &quot;new brain.&quot; Finn&#x27;s 1998 musical &quot;A New Brain&quot; is based on his experience with AVM and his subsequent successful surgery.

He is gay, and lives with his life partner, Arthur Salvadore, in New York City and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he is a composer and writer.

Finn is a member of the NYU Tisch Graduate Program in Musical Theater Writing faculty. He is the co-founder and artistic producer of the Musical Theatre Lab at the Barrington Stage Company in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, established in 2006.

<doc id="517479" wikidata="Q1045726" url="?curid=517479" title="Plus ultra">
<text> (, , ) is a Latin phrase and the national motto of Spain. A reversal of the original phrase &quot;non plus ultra&quot; (&quot;nothing further beyond&quot;), said to have been inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules at the Strait of Gibraltar (which marked the edge of the known world in antiquity), it has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence. Its original version, the personal motto of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, also Duke of Burgundy and King of Spain, was &quot;Plus oultre&quot; in French. It appears on the columns of the Spanish coat of arms, in reference to the discovery of the New World.

==History==
&quot;Plus oultre&quot;, French for &quot;further beyond&quot;, was adopted by the young Duke of Burgundy and new King of Spain Charles of Habsburg as his personal motto at the suggestion of his adviser Luigi Marliano, an Italian physician, in 1516. It was emblematic of Marliano&#x27;s vision of a Christian empire spanning beyond the boundaries of the Old World, now that Charles also controlled territories in the New World through the Spanish crown, and it was also associated with the desire to bring the Reconquista past Gibraltar into North Africa and revive the crusades of the chivalric tradition. The motto is first recorded on the back of Charles&#x27;s chair in the church of St Gudule, Brussels. Spaniards translated the original French into Latin due to the hostility they bore for the French-speaking Burgundian advisors and ministers Charles brought with him to Spain from the Low Countries. At Charles&#x27;s entry into Burgos in 1520, an arch was set up bearing on one side, &quot;Plus ultra&quot;, and on the other &quot;All of Africa weeps because it knows that you have the key [Gibraltar and] have to be its master&quot;. &quot;Plus oultre&quot; continued to be used in the Burgundian Low Countries and also appeared in the wooden panelling of Charles&#x27;s palace in Granada. As a consequence of Charles&#x27;s election as Holy Roman Emperor, both &quot;Plus oultre&quot; and began to be used in Italy and Germany, together with a less successful German translation, &quot;Noch Weiter&quot;. In Spain, the Latin motto continued to be popular after Charles V&#x27;s death. It appeared in Habsburg propaganda and was used to encourage Spanish explorers to ignore the old warning and go beyond the Pillars of Hercules. Today it is featured on arms of Spain.

<doc id="517490" wikidata="Q63531700" url="?curid=517490" title="Traction engine">
<text>A traction engine is a steam-powered tractor used to move heavy loads on roads, plough ground or to provide power at a chosen location. The name derives from the Latin &quot;tractus&quot;, meaning &#x27;drawn&#x27;, since the prime function of any traction engine is to draw a load behind it. They are sometimes called road locomotives to distinguish them from railway locomotives – that is, steam engines that run on rails.

Traction engines tend to be large, robust and powerful, but also heavy, slow, and difficult to manoeuvre. Nevertheless, they revolutionized agriculture and road haulage at a time when the only alternative prime mover was the draught horse.

They became popular in industrialised countries from around 1850, when the first self-propelled portable steam engines for agricultural use were developed. Production continued well into the early part of the 20th century, when competition from internal combustion engine-powered tractors saw them fall out of favour, although some continued in commercial use in the United Kingdom well into the 1950s and later. All types of traction engines have now been superseded in commercial use. However, several thousand examples have been preserved worldwide, many in working order. Steam fairs are held throughout the year in the United Kingdom and in other countries, where visitors can experience working traction engines at close hand.

Traction engines were cumbersome and ill-suited for crossing soft or heavy ground, so their agricultural use was usually either &quot;on the belt&quot; – powering farm machinery by means of a continuous leather belt driven by the flywheel, a form of power take-off – or in pairs, dragging an implement on a cable from one side of a field to another. However, where soil conditions permitted, direct hauling of implements (&quot;off the drawbar&quot;) was preferred; in America, this led to the divergent development of the steam tractor. 
This aside, American designs were far more varied than those of the British with different boiler positions, wheel numbers and piston placements being used. Additionally American engines often had higher top speeds than those of Britain as well as the ability to run on straw.

==History==


Limits of technical knowledge and manufacturing technology meant that practicable road vehicles powered by steam did not start to appear until the early years of the 19th century. In 1841, Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jefferies produced an early traction engine. The design (which was led by a horse to steer it) failed to attract any purchasers. They tried again in 1849, this time without the steering horse, but the machine was under-built for threshing work it was designed for.

The commercially successful traction engine was developed from an experiment in 1859 when Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. This alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between the crankshaft and the rear axle. Aveling is regarded as &quot;the father of the traction engine&quot;.
 Aveling&#x27;s first engine still required a horse for steering. Other influences were existing vehicles which were the first to be referred to as traction engines such as the Boydell engines manufactured by various companies and those developed for road haulage by Bray. The first half of the 1860s was a period of great experimentation, but by the end of the decade the standard form of the traction engine had evolved and would change little over the next sixty years.

As part of these improvements the steering was improved to no longer need a horse, and the drive chain was replaced with gears. In America traction engines fitted with continuous tracks were being used from 1869. Compound engine designs were introduced in 1881. Until the quality of roads improved there was little demand for faster vehicles, and engines were geared accordingly to cope with their use on rough roads and farm tracks.

Right through to the first decades of the twentieth century, manufacturers continued to seek a way to reach the economic potential of direct-pull ploughing and, particularly in North America, this led to the American development of the steam tractor. British companies such as Mann&#x27;s and Garrett developed potentially viable direct ploughing engines; however, market conditions were against them and they failed to gain widespread popularity. These market conditions arose in the wake of the First World War when there was a glut of surplus equipment available as a result of British Government policy. Large numbers of Fowler ploughing engines had been constructed in order to increase the land under tillage during the war and many new light Fordson F tractors had been imported from 1917 onwards.

=== Decline ===

Road steam disappeared through restrictions and charges that drove up their operating costs. Through 1921, steam tractors had demonstrated clear economic advantages over horse power for heavy hauling and short journeys. However, petrol lorries were starting to show better efficiency and could be purchased cheaply as war surplus; on a busy route a 3-ton petrol lorry could save about £100 per month compared to its steam equivalent, in spite of restrictive speed limits and relatively high fuel prices and maintenance costs.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s there were tighter restrictions on road steam haulage, including speed, smoke and vapour limits and a &#x27;wetted tax&#x27;, where the tax due was proportional to the size of the wetted area of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%). As a result of the Salter Report on road funding, an &#x27;axle weight tax&#x27; was introduced in 1933 in order to charge commercial motor vehicles more for the costs of maintaining the road system and to do away with the perception that the free use of roads was subsidising the competitors of rail freight. The tax was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and was particularly restrictive on steam propulsion, which was heavier than its petrol equivalent.

Initially, imported oil was taxed much more than British-produced coal, but in 1934 Oliver Stanley, the Minister for Transport, reduced taxes on fuel oils while raising the Road Fund charge on road locomotives to £100 per year (equivalent to around £9000 today, 2024) provoking protests by engine manufacturers, hauliers, showmen and the coal industry. This was at a time of high unemployment in the mining industry, when the steam haulage business represented a market of 950,000 tons of coal annually. The tax was devastating to the businesses of heavy hauliers and showmen and precipitated the scrapping of many engines.

The last new UK-built traction engines were constructed during the 1930s, although many continued in commercial use for many years while there remained experienced enginemen available to drive them.

=== Preservation ===

Perhaps the first organisation to take a general interest in traction engine preservation was the Road Locomotive Society formed in 1937.

From the 1950s, the &#x27;preservation movement&#x27; started to build as enthusiasts realised that traction engines were in danger of dying out. Many of the remaining engines were bought by enthusiasts, and restored to working order. Traction engine rallies began, initially as races between engine owners and their charges, later developing into the significant tourist attractions that take place in many locations each year.

The Traction Engine Register records the details of traction engines, steam road rollers, steam wagons, steam fire engines and portable engines that are known to survive in the United Kingdom and Irish Republic. It recorded 2,851 self moving engines and wagons, 687 portable engines (non-self moving), 160 steam fire engines existing in 2016. A new edition of the Register is planned in 2020. It was previously estimated in May 2011 by an unknown source that over 2,000 traction engines have been preserved. This figure may include engines preserved elsewhere in the world, particularly the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but if so, is an underestimate. Comprehensive information on past UK manufacturers and their production is recorded by the Road Locomotive Society based in the UK.

==Operation==

Although the first traction engines employed a chain drive, it is more typical for large gears to be used to transfer the drive from the crankshaft to the rear axle.

The machines typically have two large powered wheels at the back and two smaller wheels for steering at the front. However, some traction engines used a four-wheel-drive variation, and some experimented with an early form of caterpillar track.
==Types and usage==
Traction engines saw commercial use in a variety of roles between the mid-nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries. Each role required a machine with a different set of characteristics, and the traction engine evolved into a number of different types to suit these different roles.

===Agricultural (general purpose) engine===

General purpose engines were the most common form in the countryside. They were used for hauling and as a stationary power source. Even when farmers did not own such a machine they would rely upon it from time to time. Many farms would use draught horses throughout the year, but during the harvest, threshing contractors would travel from farm to farm hauling the threshing machine which would be set up in the field and powered from the engine – a good example of the moveable stationary engine.

====US (agricultural) traction engine====

Favourable soil conditions meant that US traction engines usually pulled their ploughs behind them, thereby eliminating the complexities of providing a cable drum and extra gearing, hence simplifying maintenance. American traction engines were manufactured in a variety of sizes, with the 6 nhp Russell being the smallest commercially made, and the large engines made by Russell, Case, and Reeves being the largest.

===Ploughing engine===

A distinct form of traction engine, characterised by the provision of a large diameter winding drum driven by separate gearing from the steam engine. Onto the drum a long length of wire rope was wound, which was used to haul an implement, such as a plough, across a field, while the engine remained on the headland. This minimized the area of land subject to soil compaction.

The winding drum was either mounted horizontally (below the boiler), vertically (to one side), or even concentrically, so that it encircled the boiler. The majority were underslung (horizontal), however, and necessitated the use of an extra-long boiler to allow enough space for the drum to fit between the front and back wheels. These designs were the largest and longest traction engines to be built.

Mostly the ploughing engines worked in pairs, one on each side of the field, with the wire rope from each machine fastened to the implement to be hauled. The two drivers communicated by signals using the engine whistles. The engines in the pairs differed slightly with one designed to feed the cable out on the left side and the other on the right. Occasionally an alternative system was used where the plough was pulled between a single engine and an anchor.

A variety of implements were constructed for use with ploughing engines. The most common were the balance plough and the cultivator – ploughing and cultivating being the most physically demanding jobs to do on an arable farm. Other implements could include a mole drainer, used to create an underground drainage channel or pipe, or a dredger bucket for dredging rivers or moats. The engines were frequently provided with a &#x27;spud tray&#x27; on the front axle, to store the &#x27;spuds&#x27; which would be fitted to the wheels when travelling across claggy ground.

Ploughing engines were rare in the US; ploughs were usually hauled directly by an agricultural engine or steam tractor.

====History====
The first steam ploughing engine built and trialled was in 1837 when John Heathcoat MP demonstrated a steam powered vehicle he designed for ploughing very soft ground. This used a very early form of continuous tracks, and its twin-cylinder steam engine could be either used for the ploughing winch or for propulsion. Another ploughing engine, devised by Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby, possibly designed by Daniel Gooch and constructed at Swindon Works, the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland, awarded £100 out of a possible £500 of its prize for creating a steam ploughing engine, . Lord Willoughby had indicated that his design could be copied freely, and Fowler had visited Grimsthorpe Castle, the estate where the ploughing engines were deployed. Between 1855 and 1857 a farmer by the name of William Smith and John Fowler developed wire driven ploughing engines that were powered by portable engines. By 1863 W. Savory and Sons had introduced a mobile ploughing engine and were using engines at both ends of the field. Their wire drum was vertical and was mounted around the boiler of the engine.

Production took place outside the UK with Kemna Bau of Germany producing ploughing engines.

Peak use in Britain was during World War 1 with a bit over 600 pairs as the country attempted to increase food production. Use of ploughing engines declined in the 1920s as internal combustion engine powered tractors took over. John Fowler &amp; Co. stopped producing of ploughing engines in 1935 . Low prices in the aftermath of World War 2 resulted meant a few farmers purchased them and continued to use them into the 1950s. As late as 1998 few engines in preservation were taking the occasional commercial job dredging lakes.
===Steam tractor (US)===

In North America, the term &quot;steam tractor&quot; usually refers to a type of agricultural tractor powered by a steam engine, used extensively in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

===Steam tractor (UK)===

In Great Britain, the term &quot;steam tractor&quot; is more usually applied to the smallest models of traction engine – typically those weighing below 5 tons for the engine to be single manned (up until 1923 anything above had to be manned by at least two people; a driver and steersman); used for hauling small loads on public roads. In 1923 the weight limit was raised to 7.5 tons. Although known as &quot;light steam tractors&quot;, these engines are generally just smaller versions of the road locomotive.

They were popular in the timber trade in the UK, although variations were also designed for general light road haulage and showman&#x27;s use.

The most popular of these designs was probably the Garrett 4CD, meaning &quot;4&quot; nominal horse power compound.
===Road locomotive===


Designed for haulage of heavy loads on public highways, it was common for two or even three to be coupled together to allow heavier loads to be handled.

The characteristic features of these engines are very large rear driving wheels fitted with solid rubber tyres, three-speed gearing (most traction engine types have only two gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This can be used by removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.

James Boydell worked with the British steam traction engine manufacturer Charles Burrell &amp; Sons to produce road haulage engines from 1856 that used his dreadnaught wheels which were particularly suited to bad roads or off-road use.

One place where road locomotives found a significant amount of use was in hauling timber from where it was felled to timber yards. Once the timber had been moved to a road the road movements were carried out hauling the trunks on pole wagons. In France road locomotives were used to move mail in the 1880s.

A number of road locomotives are fitted with a crane boom on the front. The boom pivot is mounted on the front axle assembly and a small winch is mounted on an extension to the smokebox in front of the chimney, the cable passing over a sheave at the top of the boom arm. The winch is powered by bevel gears on a shaft driven directly from the engine, with some form of clutch providing raise/lower control. These road locomotives can be used to load a trailer as well as to haul it to a new location. They are often referred to as &#x27;crane engines&#x27;.

A particularly distinctive form of road locomotive was the showman&#x27;s engine. These were operated by travelling showmen both to tow fairground equipment and to power it when set up, either directly or by running a generator. These could be highly decorated and formed part of the spectacle of the fair. Some were fitted with a small crane that could be used when assembling the ride. About 400 were built with 107 surviving into preservation.

The poor state of the roads and the larger distances involved meant road locomotives (including showman&#x27;s engines) were less used in the US.

====History====
In Britain the rise of the use of road locomotives was held back by high tolls charged by turnpike roads. The tolls were eventually limited by the Locomotive Act 1861. Four years later, the Locomotives Act 1865 was passed limiting engines to 4 mph and requiring that they preceded by a person carrying a red flag. The first traction engine focused on road haulage was offered for sale by Charles Burrell &amp; Sons in 1856 and tyres were introduced around the same time. In 1896 the speed limit in the UK was raised to 6MPH and the red flag carrier requirement was dropped.

===Steamroller===
Related to the steam traction engine, the steam roller was used for road building and flattening ground. They were typically designed with a single heavy roller (in practice, usually a pair of adjacent rollers) replacing the front wheels and axle, and smooth rear wheels without strakes.

Some traction engines were designed to be convertible: the same basic machine could be fitted with either standard treaded road wheels, or else smooth rolls – the changeover between the two being achieved in less than half a day.

==Relatives of the traction engine==
A number of other steam-powered vehicles share design features with the traction engine, usually because the same technology was re-used in a new application.

===Portable engine===
A portable engine is a type of self-contained steam engine and boiler combination that may be moved from site to site. Although bearing a strong family resemblance, in both appearance and (stationary) operation, the portable engine is &quot;not&quot; classed as a traction engine as it is not self-propelled. However, it is included in this list because the traction engine is a direct descendant.

===Steam wagon===
A steam wagon is a steam-powered road vehicle for carrying freight. It was the earliest form of lorry (truck) and came in two basic forms: &quot;overtype&quot; and &quot;undertype&quot; – the distinction being the position of the engine relative to the boiler. Among the firms that specialized in them in the 1900s was the short-lived Invicta Works of Maidstone, owned by Jesse Ellis.

The overtype had a steam engine mounted on top of a fire-tube boiler, in a similar manner to a traction engine. The front of an overtype steam wagon bears a close family resemblance to traction engines, and manufacturers who made both may well have been able to use some common parts.

The undertype had the steam engine mounted under the boiler, usually between the frames of the chassis. The boiler was usually mounted well forward and was often a vertical and/or water tube type.

Steam wagons were the dominant form of powered road traction for commercial haulage in the early part of the twentieth century, although they were a largely British phenomenon, with few manufacturers outside Great Britain. Competition from internal-combustion-powered vehicles and adverse legislation meant that few remained in commercial use beyond the Second World War.

===Traction engines as railway locomotives===

Several traction engine builders (such as Aveling and Porter and Fowler) built light railway locomotives based on their traction engines. In their crudest form these simply had flanged steel wheels to enable them to run on rails. More sophisticated models had the boiler and engine mounted on a chassis which carried railway-wagon style axles. The rear axle was driven from the engine by gear or chain-drive. These unusual locomotives were sold to small industries for use in shunting and marshalling duties, although they also found favour with engineering firms engaged in the construction of mainline railways for hauling men, equipment and materials over the partly constructed line.

==Terminology==
* &quot;spud&quot; or &quot;lug&quot; – strip of angled metal that could be bolted to the driving wheels to provide greater traction on soft or heavy ground. Spuds were often required on ploughing engines when moving across farmland.
* &quot;strake&quot; – name for the diagonal strips cast into or rivetted onto the wheel rims to provide traction on unmade ground (similar to the tread on a pneumatic tyre).
* &quot;Nominal horse power&quot; – nhp is the typical way that traction engines are rated. However, it has long been accepted that nominal horse power greatly understates the actual power of the engine. There are many ways to estimate the actual horse power but none of them gives an accurate answer; for example, a 4 nhp engine is said to be approximately ; however a 4 nhp engine can easily pull a laden 8-wheeler lorry, while a diesel engine of cannot. Thus, many have resigned themselves that this debate will never be settled and, while nominal horsepower gives a convenient way of rating traction engines, it may never be converted accurately into diesel HP.

==Modern use==

Although no longer used commercially, traction engines of all types continue to be maintained and preserved by enthusiastic individuals and are frequently exhibited at agricultural shows in Europe (particularly the UK), Canada and the United States. They are often a main attraction in a live steam festival &quot;(see List of steam fairs)&quot;.

Model traction engines, powered by steam, are manufactured by several companies, notably Mamod and Wilesco. Larger scale model engines are popular subjects for model engineers to construct, either as a supplied kit of parts, or machined from raw materials. A small number of full size traction engines have been built including a Case 150.

==Traction engines in popular culture==
In film
*The 1962 film &quot;The Iron Maiden&quot; featured a showman&#x27;s engine as the film&#x27;s star, along with many others, at the annual rally at Woburn Abbey.
*In the 2004 film &quot;Tremors 4: The Legend Begins&quot;, the people of Rejection, Nevada had a traction engine and were proud of it. During the final battle, two of the characters fired their guns from the traction engine, and the traction engine rammed and killed the last graboid.

In literature
*Trevor the Traction Engine is one of the non-railway characters featured in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; of children&#x27;s books by the Rev. W. Awdry. Appearing in several of the books, the traction engine was originally &#x27;saved from scrap&#x27; by The Vicar of Wellsworth with the help of Edward the Blue Engine. Trevor has also appeared in a number of episodes in the TV spin-off &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. Another traction engine, Fergus the Railway Traction Engine, also appears in &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, but unlike Trevor, Fergus runs on rails instead of roads. Theo from &quot;Journey Beyond Sodor&quot; is based on a Brill Tramway No. 1.
*In the book &quot;Gumdrop and The Farmer&#x27;s Friend&quot;, by Val Biro, the vintage motor-car Gumdrop is rescued from a snowy ditch by &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Friend&quot;, a traction engine belonging to a local farmer. Some months later, the two vehicles are instrumental in thwarting a pair of car thieves. &lt;BR&gt;The end-papers of the book include a simplified cut-away drawing of the traction engine: a single-cylinder, 6 nhp Fowler light tractor built in 1903.
*Traction engines for road haulage feature prominently in Keith Roberts&#x27; alternate-history novel &quot;Pavane&quot;.
*In the 1960s, cutaway drawings of traction engines by Geoffrey Wheeler featured in &quot;Eagle&quot; comics and a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; annual.

On television

*Fred Dibnah of Bolton, England, was known as a National Institution in Great Britain for the conservation of old traction engines and other steam engines. His television series &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Made in Britain&quot; shows him touring the United Kingdom in his rebuilt 10-ton traction engine.
* In the television play &quot;Threads&quot;, depicting the consequences of nuclear war in the United Kingdom, traction engines come back into use as petrol becomes unavailable.

<doc id="517501" wikidata="Q760211" url="?curid=517501" title="Manic Miner">
<text>Manic Miner is a platform game written for the ZX Spectrum by Matthew Smith. It was published by Bug-Byte in 1983, then later the same year by Software Projects. The first game in the &quot;Miner Willy&quot; series, the design was inspired by &quot;Miner 2049er&quot; (1982) for the Atari 8-bit computers. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called &quot;Manic Miner&quot; one of the most influential platform games of all time, and it has been ported to numerous home computers, video game consoles, and mobile phones.

==Gameplay==

In each of the twenty caverns, each one screen in size, are several flashing objects, which the player must collect before Willy&#x27;s oxygen supply runs out. Once the player has collected the objects in one cavern, they must then go to the now-flashing portal, which will take them to the next cavern. The player must avoid enemies, listed in the cassette inlay as &quot;...Poisonous Pansies, Spiders, Slime, and worst of all, Manic Mining Robots...&quot; which move along predefined paths at constant speeds. Willy can also be killed by falling too far, so players must time the precision of jumps and other movements to prevent such falls or collisions with the enemies.

Extra lives are gained every 10,000 points, and the game ends when the player has no lives left. Above the final portal is a garden. To the right is a house with a white picket fence and red car parked in front. To the left is a slope leading to backyard with a pond and tree; a white animal, resembling a cat or mouse, watches the sun set behind the pond. Upon gaining his freedom, the game restarts from the first level with no increase in difficulty.

The in-game music is &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot; from Edvard Grieg&#x27;s music to Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. The music that plays during the title screen is an arrangement of &quot;The Blue Danube&quot;.

==Release==

There are some differences between the Bug-Byte and Software Projects versions:

# In &quot;Processing Plant&quot;, the enemy at the end of the conveyor belt is a bush in the original, whereas the Software Projects one resembles a Pac-Man ghost.
# In &quot;Amoebatrons&#x27; Revenge&quot;, the original Bug-Byte amoebatrons look like alien octopuses with tentacles hanging down, whereas the Software Projects amoebatrons resemble the Bug-Byte logo.
# In &quot;The Warehouse&quot;, the original game has threshers travelling up and down the vertical slots, rotating about the screen&#x27;s X-axis. The Software Projects version has Penrose triangles (i.e. the Software Projects logo) instead, which rotate about the screen&#x27;s Z-axis.
# The Bug-Byte cheat code was the numerical sequence &quot;&quot;6031769&quot;, based on Matthew Smith&#x27;s driving licence. In the Software Projects version this changed to &quot;typewriter&quot;.

==Ports==

The game was officially ported to the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 16, Commodore 64, Dragon 32/64, Game Boy Advance, mobile phones. MSX, Oric 1, and SAM Coupé,

===SAM Coupé===

The SAM Coupé version, programmed by Matthew Holt, like the ZX original requires pixel-perfect timing, and both graphics and audio, the latter by František Fuka, were greatly updated. In addition to the original twenty caverns, forty additional caverns were included in this release. Levels were designed by David Ledbury, and winners of a competition run by SAM Computers Ltd.

===PMD 85===
The game was ported for Czechoslovak Computers PMD 85 in 1985. The authors of the PMD 85 version are Vít Libovický and Daniel Jenne. They made it as accurate as they could.

===BBC Micro===
The BBC Micro version does not have the Solar Power Generator, instead containing a completely different room called &quot;The Meteor Shower&quot;. This has the &quot;reflecting machines&quot; from the Solar Power Generator, but there is no beam of light. Instead, it has meteors which descend from the top of the screen and disintegrate when they hit platforms, like the Skylabs in Skylab Landing Bay. It also has forcefields which turn on and off, and the layout is completely different.

Also, the last screen (which is still called &quot;The Final Barrier&quot;) is complex and difficult (unlike the Spectrum version, which is considered to be fairly easy) and has a completely different layout. It also features the blinking forcefields.

===Amstrad CPC===
The Amstrad version was effectively the same as the Spectrum version by Software Projects, except that Eugene&#x27;s Lair was renamed &quot;Eugene Was Here&quot;, and the layout of &quot;The Final Barrier&quot; was again completely different (but is more similar to the Spectrum version than the BBC version).

===Dragon 32/64===

The Dragon 32 version, programmed by Roy Coates, had two extra rooms (i.e. 22 altogether) and a cheat mode accessed by typing &quot;P&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;ENGUIN&quot;. To retain the resolution of the original, the Dragon version used PMODE 4 in black/white mode.

===Oric/Atmos===
Programmed by Chris Larkin, the Oric version has 32 screens instead of 20.

===Commodore 16===
The Commodore 16 version was limited in a number of respects - this was mainly due to the initial lack of developer material for the C16 machine, and a two-week deadline to produce and test the game, then generate a master tape for the duplication house. Other issues were the lack of a fast loader system for the C16 cassette deck, and as a result it took about seven minutes for the game to load, and a bug resulted in the game entering the first screen as soon as the tape had finished loading instead of waiting for the user to start the game. Further issues related to the lack of music and in game sound, and the way that video memory was mapped in the C16, this resulted in a number of the screens having to be removed so that load time and video mapping could be correctly handled.

==Reception==

In August 1983, sales of Bug-Byte&#x27;s original ZX Spectrum release of &quot;Manic Miner&quot; took the game to the top of the UK video games charts replacing &quot;Jet Pac&quot;. The Commodore 64 version, released by Software Projects, reached the number one position in early 1984. It went on to become the best selling Commodore 64 game and third best selling ZX Spectrum game of 1984.

The SAM Coupé version scored 84% in &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; and 88% in &quot;Crash&quot;.

&quot;Manic Miner&quot; was the winner of &quot;Best Arcade Style Game&quot;, and placed third in the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; category at the 1983 Golden Joystick Awards voted for by readers of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine. &quot;Manic Miner&quot; was placed at number 25 in the &quot;&quot;Your Sinclair&quot; official top 100&quot; Spectrum games of all time, and was later voted number 6 in the &quot;Readers&#x27; Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

In 1991, &quot;ACE&quot; magazine listed &quot;Manic Miner&quot; and its sequel &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, along with &quot;Hunchback&quot;, &quot;Impossible Mission&quot;, and the Mario series, as the greatest platform games of all time, calling &quot;Manic Miner&quot; &quot;the first great home computer platform game&quot;.

The game was #97 on Polygon&#x27;s 2017 retrospective list of the 500 best games of all time.

==Legacy ==
Unofficial ports exist for the Acorn Archimedes, Acorn Atom, Acorn Electron, Atari ST, Cambridge Z88, Commodore 128, HP48, Linux, Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, MS-DOS, Neo Geo Pocket Color, Nintendo 64, Orao, Playdate, PlayStation, PMD 85, TRS-80 Color Computer, VIC-20, Zune, and ZX81.

The sequel to &quot;Manic Miner&quot; is &quot;Jet Set Willy&quot;, and was followed by &quot;Jet Set Willy II&quot;. Software Projects also released a game in the style of &quot;Manic Miner&quot; for the VIC-20 called &quot;The Perils of Willy&quot;.

&quot;Manic Miner 360&quot; was released for the Xbox 360 as an Xbox Live Indie Game in June 2012.

A homage to the &quot;Manic Miner&quot; loading screen appears in one episode of the 2005 British sitcom &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;.

<text>Jagertee (also Jägertee) is an alcoholic punch historically made by mixing &quot;Inländer-Rum&quot; with spiced black tea. It is served warm and is typically consumed during winter in the cold parts of Central Europe.

Although Jagertee is easily made at home, ready-made mixtures which already contain spices and sugar are sold in shops. The Austrian rum &quot;Stroh&quot; is often used for making it; this brand also produces its own ready-made variety.

Jagertee has become a popular &quot;après-ski&quot; drink, especially among tourists in the Alps. Jagertee carts sell the beverage outside at ski resorts and winter festivals.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Jagertee&quot; (alternatively &quot;Jagatee&quot; or &quot;Jägertee&quot;) is derived from the Austro-Bavarian pronunciation of the standard German &quot;Jäger&quot; &quot;hunter&quot; + &quot;Tee&quot; &quot;tea&quot;. According to EC Regulation 110/2008, Annex III, No. 32, it is a Protected Designation of Origin reserved for the beverage made in Austria. Therefore, varieties made in Germany are sold under names like &quot;Hüttentee&quot; (&quot;hut tea&quot;) or &quot;Förstertee&quot; (&quot;forester tea&quot;). It has also been sold under the name of &quot;Grog&quot; in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Some rural establishments also serve &quot;Wilderertee&quot; (&quot;poacher&#x27;s tea&quot;), which is even stronger.

<doc id="517512" wikidata="Q18562285" url="?curid=517512" title="Draft horse">
<text>A draft horse (US) or draught horse (UK), also known as dray horse, carthorse, work horse or heavy horse, is a large horse bred to be a working animal hauling freight and doing heavy agricultural tasks such as plowing. There are a number of breeds, with varying characteristics, but all share common traits of strength, patience, and a docile temperament.

While indispensable to generations of pre-industrial farmers, draft horses are used today for a multitude of purposes, including farming, draft horse showing, logging, recreation, and other uses. Draft breeds have been crossbred with light riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred to create sport horses or warmbloods. While most draft horses are used for driving, they can be ridden and some of the lighter draft breeds are capable performers under saddle.

==Characteristics==
Draft horses are recognizable by their extremely muscular build. They tend to have broad, short backs with powerful hindquarters. In general, they are taller and tend to have heavier bone and a more upright shoulder than riding horses, producing conformation that is well suited for pulling. Many draft breeds have heavier hair, called feathering on their lower legs. Draft breeds range from approximately high and from .

== Background ==

Humans domesticated horses and used them to perform a variety of duties. One type of horse-powered work was the hauling of heavy loads, plowing fields, and other tasks that required pulling ability. A heavy, calm, patient, and well-muscled animal was desired for this work. Conversely, a light, more energetic horse was needed for riding and rapid transport. Thus, to the extent possible, a certain amount of selective breeding was used to develop different types of horse for different types of work.

It is a common misunderstanding that the Destrier that carried the armoured knight of the Middle Ages had the size and conformation of a modern draft horse, and some of these Medieval war horses may have provided some bloodlines for some of the modern draft breeds. The reality was that the high-spirited, quick-moving Destrier was closer to the size, build, and temperament of a modern Andalusian or Friesian. There also were horses of more phlegmatic temperaments used for pulling military wagons or performing ordinary farm work which provided bloodlines of the modern draft horse. Records indicate that even medieval drafts were not as large as those today. Of the modern draft breeds, the Percheron probably has the closest ties to the medieval war horse.

By the 19th century horses weighing more than that also moved at a quick pace were in demand. Tall stature, muscular backs, and powerful hindquarters made the draft horse a source of horsepower for farming, hauling freight and moving passengers. The advent of railroads increased demand for working horses, as a growing economy still needed transport over the &#x27;last mile&#x27; between the goods yard or station and the final customer. Even in the 20th century, until motor vehicles became an affordable and reliable substitute, draft horses were used for practical work. 

Over half a million draft horses were used during World War I. The British were importing American draft horses to supplement their dwindling stock even before America joined the war, preferring Percheron crosses which they said had &quot;great endurance, fine physique, soundness, activity, willingness to work, and almost unfailing good temper&quot;. British buyers were buying 10,000 to 25,000 American horses and mules a month, eventually making up about two-thirds of British Army war horses.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, thousands of draft horses were imported from Western Europe into the United States. Percherons came from France, Belgians from Brabant, Shires from England, Clydesdales from Scotland. Many American draft breed registries were founded in the late 19th century. The Percheron, with 40,000 broodmares registered as of 1915, was America&#x27;s most numerous draft breed at the turn of the 20th century. A breed developed exclusively in the U.S. was the American Cream Draft, which had a stud book established by the 1930s.

Beginning in the late 19th century, and with increasing mechanization in the 20th century, especially following World War I in the US and after World War II in Europe, the popularity of the internal combustion engine, and particularly the tractor, reduced the need for the draft horse. Many were sold to slaughter for horse meat and a number of breeds went into significant decline.

== Modern uses ==
Today, draft horses can be seen in horse shows, pulling competitions, heavy horse trials, parades pulling large wagons, and pulling tourist carriages. However, they are still seen on some smaller farms in the US and Europe. They are particularly popular with agrarian groups such as the Amish and Mennonites. Draft horses are still used for logging, a forestry management practice to remove logs from dense woodland where there is insufficient space for mechanized vehicles or for other conservation considerations.

Draft horse breeds have played a significant role in the development of many warmblood breeds, popular today in advanced level equine sports.

Small areas still exist where draft horses are widely used as transportation due to legislation preventing automotive traffic, such as on Mackinac Island in the United States.

==Care==

Management of a large draft horse can be costly, including feed, shoeing, and veterinary care. Although many draft horses can work without a need for shoes, if they are required, farriers may charge twice the price to shoe a draft horse as a light riding horse because of the extra labor and specialized equipment required. Historically, draft horses were shod with horseshoes that were significantly wider and heavier than those for other types of horses, custom-made, often with caulkins.

The draft horse&#x27;s metabolism is a bit slower than lighter horse breeds, more akin to that of ponies, requiring less feed per pound of body weight. This is possibly due to their calmer nature. Nonetheless, because of their sheer size, most require a significant amount of feed per day. Generally a supplement to balance nutrients is preferred over a large quantity of grain. They consume hay or other forage from 1.5% to 3% of their body weight per day, depending on work level. They also can drink up to of water a day. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, and risk of laminitis can be a concern.

== World records ==
The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire born in 1846 named Sampson (renamed Mammoth). He stood high, and his peak weight was estimated at .

At over , a Shire gelding named Goliath (1977–2001) was the Guinness Book of World Records record holder for the world&#x27;s tallest &quot;living&quot; horse (until his death). Big Jake (2001–2021), an American Belgian standing , held the record for tallest living horse from 2010 until his death in 2021. As of 2024, there is no living record holder.

<text>Bolesław V the Chaste (; 21 June 1226 – 7 December 1279) was Duke of Sandomierz in Lesser Poland from 1232 and High Duke of Poland from 1243 until his death, as the last male representative of the Lesser Polish branch of Piasts.

==Birth and nickname==

Bolesław V was born on 21 June 1226 at Stary Korczyn, as the third child and only son of Leszek I the White by his wife Grzymisława, a Rurikid princess of disputed parentage.

Named after his great-grandfather Bolesław Wrymouth, the numeral V was assigned to him in the &quot;Poczet królów Polskich&quot;. His nickname of &quot;Chaste&quot; (Latin: &quot;Pudicus&quot;), appeared relatively early and was already mentioned in the &quot;Rocznik franciszkański krakowski&quot;. It was given to him by his subjects because of the vows of chastity that Bolesław V and his wife Kinga of Hungary had jointly taken; for this reason, their marriage was never consummated.

==Youth==
===Father&#x27;s death===
On 24 November 1227, during the Congress of Gąsawa, Bolesław V&#x27;s father, Leszek the White, was killed. Like his own father and paternal grandfather before him, he was orphaned at young age. After Duke Leszek&#x27;s death many people claimed the custody of his only son. The nobility of Kraków wanted the regency to be exercised by Dowager Duchess Grzymisława, jointly with the local voivode and bishop; however, this was contrary to the treaty of mutual inheritance signed in 1217 by Leszek and Władysław III Spindleshanks, under which it was agreed that in the event of the death of one of them, the other would take the government of his domains and custody of his minor children.

On 6 December 1227 Casimir I of Kuyavia - who probably represented his father Konrad I of Masovia at the funeral of Leszek I - advanced his father&#x27;s claims over the custody of Bolesław V and his inheritance as his closest male relative. Due to the lack of response, Konrad I came to Skaryszew to negotiate with Grzymisława and the local nobility in the first half of March 1228, with regard to assuming the guardianship of his nephew during his minority. The nobility, especially the Gryfici family, preferred the rule of Władysław III Spindleshanks, but at that point he was in the midst of fighting with his nephew Władysław Odonic and was unable to claim his rights. Konrad I then appeared in the northern part of Kraków, but at his side were only the Topór and Sztarza families, and so this attempt to take the Seniorate failed. According to Kazimierz Krotowski, the absence from Lesser Poland was the cause of the Prussian invasion to Masovia.

===Adoption by Władysław Spindleshanks ===

On 5 May 1228, a meeting was organized in Cienia between Władysław Spindleshanks and a delegation of Kraków nobles, which included Bishop Iwo Odrowąż; voivode Marek Gryfita; Pakosław Awdaniec the Old, voivode of Sandomierz; and Mściwój, castellan of Wiślica. Under the terms of the meeting, Władysław agreed to the adoption of Bolesław V, making him his successor over Kraków and Greater Poland. After the meeting, Władysław arrived in Kraków, where Grzymisława formally gave him the rule of the city. The dowager duchess and her son received the Duchy of Sandomierz, where she exercised the regency.

Shortly afterwards Władysław Odonic escaped from prison and the fight for Greater Poland was resumed. Władysław Spindleshanks was forced to leave Kraków. Then the local nobility, with the consent of Grzymisława, called Henry the Bearded to Kraków, but only to rule as a governor. In the summer of 1228 Konrad I of Masovia attacked Kraków, but was defeated at the Battle of Skała by Henry I&#x27;s son, Henry the Pious. However, a year later Konrad I captured Henry the Bearded and occupied Sieradz-Łęczyca and later Sandomierz, removing Grzymisława from power, despite resistance from the local nobility. In 1230 Władysław Spindleshanks, with the help of Henry I, made an unsuccessful attempt to recover his lands. Władysław died one year later in exile in Racibórz.

Władysław&#x27;s will named Henry the Bearded heir to Kraków and Greater Poland. In 1231, with the support of the Gryfici family, Henry obtained the rule over Sandomierz, after Grzymisława (who feared for the future of the inheritance of her infant son) surrendered the regency. During 1231-1232 Henry fought against Konrad for Lesser Poland; by the autumn of 1232 Henry finally obtained control over Lesser Poland and Konrad could only keep Sieradz-Łęczyca.

===Imprisonment by Konrad I of Masovia===

In 1233 Konrad I of Masovia captured Grzymisława and her son after personally robbing and beating them, according to a bull of Pope Gregory IX. Bolesław V and his mother were imprisoned firstly in Czersk and then in Sieciechów. The humiliations to the dowager duchess continued there, including a slap in the face by Konrad I.

Henry the Bearded decided to rescue the imprisoned prince and his mother; shortly thereafter Bolesław and Grzymisława managed to escape from the monastery of Sieciechów with the help of Kraków voivode Klement of Ruszcza and Mikołaj Gall, who was in charge of the prisoners. Both Klement and Mikołaj bribed the guards, who were busy drinking, and did not pay attention to the prisoners, who left the monastery in disguise. Jan Długosz described the events as follows:

::&quot;When one night the guards after drink and feast forgot their duties, abandoned their posts and quietly during the night Duke Bolesław and his mother secretly left the monastery.&quot;

For safety reasons, Henry the Bearded hid Bolesław and his mother in the fortress of Skała near the valley of the Prądnik river. Then, on behalf of her son, Grzymisława renounced his rights over Kraków to Henry. In 1234 a war between Henry and Konrad for Lesser Poland broke out. Thanks to Archbishop Pełka, the Treaty of Luchani was signed in August of that year, under which Bolesław received Sandomierz and gave several castles to Henry. In June 1235, Pope Gregory IX approved the Treaty of Luchani; however, shortly afterwards Konrad invaded Sandomierz, and as a result of this invasion Bolesław lost the district of Radom.

Henry the Bearded died in 1238, and his son Henry the Pious succeeded him. Like his father, he took the regency of Bolesław and his Duchy of Sandomierz. In 1239 in Wojnicz, the 13-year-old Bolesław met his bride, the 15-year-old Kinga (also known as Kunigunda), daughter of King Béla IV of Hungary. The wedding was celebrated shortly thereafter. Kinga spent her first years in Sandomierz with her mother-in-law. On 9 July of that year, a meeting also took place in Przedbórz between Bolesław and Konrad, at which the Masovian ruler agreed to renounce his claims over Sandomierz. It was at this point that Bolesław began his personal government.

===Fall of Kraków===

In 1241 the first Mongol invasion of Poland occurred. In January the Mongols took Lublin and Zawichost. Bolesław, with his mother and wife, fled to Hungary at the side of his older sister Salomea, wife of the Hungarian prince Coloman, leaving his lands without his leadership. On 13 February the Mongols conquered and burned Sandomierz, and on 11 March he refused to participate in the Battle of Chmielnik. One month later, on 9 April, the Battle of Legnica took place, in which the army commanded by High Duke Henry II the Pious was defeated, and the duke himself was killed. After the defeat of the Hungarian army at the Battle of the Sajó River two days later (11 April) - where Prince Coloman was seriously injured and died shortly after - Bolesław V and his family (including Salomea, now a widow) fled to Moravia, and then eventually returned to Poland.

After the death of Henry the Pious, his eldest son, Bolesław the Bald, took the title of high duke; however, he did not appear in Kraków, where the government was exercised by Klement of Ruszcza on his behalf. Konrad I of Masovia took this opportunity, and despite the strong resistance of the knights and nobility, he finally entered Kraków on 10 July 1241. A few months later, the fortress of Skała, held by Klement of Ruszcza, capitulated. Despite his success, Konrad failed to gain the support of the local nobility, victims of Konrad&#x27;s mercenaries (the Teutonic Order) themselves, who in 1243 appointed Bolesław the Chaste as their new ruler. On 25 May of that year the Battle of Suchodoły took place, in which the Lesser Poland and Hungarian (Sarmatian) troops, under the command of Klemens of Ruszcza, defeated the Masovian troops of Konrad. With this victory, Bolesław the Chaste regained the government over Kraków. Now at the age of 17, he was the high duke of Poland; however, he remained under the strong influence of his mother until her death. Later that year, Konrad tried to regain the control over Kraków and attacked Bolesław, but was again defeated.

==Adulthood==
===Struggle with Konrad===

Konrad I of Masovia until his death attempted to realize his ambition to become high duke and ruler of Kraków. In 1246, together with his son Casimir and supported by Lithuanian and Opole troops, he attacked Lesser Poland again. In the Battle of Zaryszów the troops of Bolesław were defeated. The duke of Kraków lost Lelów, but Kraków and Sandomierz managed to resist. The lack of funds for war forced Bolesław to take some properties of his wife, Kinga, which were paid only on 2 March 1257 during a meeting at Nowy Korczyn, when she received the district of Stary Sącz. In the autumn of 1246 was brought the final solution to the conflict when Bolesław retook Lelów. Konrad died on 31 August 1247, but his son Casimir continued the fight.

During 1254-1255 Bolesław sought the release of Siemowit I of Masovia and his wife, Pereyaslava, who were captured by his brother Casimir. They were finally released in the spring of 1255 after lengthy negotiations. In 1258 Bolesław the Pious started a long and destructive war against Casimir and his ally Świętopełk (Swantopolk) II for the castellany of Ląd. Bolesław the Chaste joined in the Greater Poland coalition against the duke of Kuyavia.

Between 29 September and 6 October 1259 Bolesław the Chaste, together with Bolesław the Pious, sacked Kujawy. A peace treaty was finally concluded on 29 November 1259. In 1260, Casimir I took over the fortress of Lelów. On 12 December during a meeting at Przedbórz, Bolesław the Chaste mediated the dispute between Casimir and Siemowit, which ended in a mutual treaty.

===Cooperation with Hungary===

Bolesław the Chaste and Bolesław the Pious were both allies of the Kingdom of Hungary. Their links with the Hungarians probably resulted from their family relationships, as both of their wives were daughters of King Béla IV and most of their Polish and Hungarian knights were descendants of the Sarmatian Iazyges, Siraces and Serboi. In 1245 both rulers supported the expedition of Rostislav Mikhailovich, who was the Hungarian candidate for the throne of Halych. On 17 August the Battle of Jarosław took place, where the Polish and Hungarian troops were defeated. Finally, a peace treaty was signed at Łęczyca.

In June and July 1253 Polish-Russian forces, including the army of Bolesław the Chaste, rushed to Moravia in support of the Hungarian expedition to Vindelicia (Austria), which was under the rule of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The war failed to achieve a settlement, despite the Polish-Russian army looting several villages. The conflict ended with a treaty; at this time, Ottokar (with the help of Bishop Paweł of Kraków) tried to persuade Bolesław the Chaste to join at his side.

In 1260 another conflict erupted between Hungary and Bohemia, when the Hungarian prince Stephen organized a marauding expedition to the Duchy of Carinthia. From June to July 1260 Bolesław, with Leszek the Black, helped the Hungarians with troops in their fight against Bohemia. On 12 July the Battle of Kressenbrunn took place, which ended with the defeat of the Hungarian army.

On 29 January 1262 during a meeting at Iwanowice, Bolesław the Chaste promised to give military support to Bolesław the Pious in his conflict with Henry the White, who was a supporter of the Kingdom of Bohemia. On 7 June a second meeting took place at Danków, where peace negotiations with Henry took place. At this opportunity, Władysław Opolski tried unsuccessfully to make a quadruple alliance with the Bohemian king, Bolesław the Chaste, and Bolesław the Pious.

King Béla IV came into conflict with his son Stephen, which caused a civil war in Hungary. In March 1266 Bolesław and his wife Kinga arranged a meeting at Buda, at which Stephen was committed to maintain peaceful relations with his father, Ottokar II, Bolesław the Chaste, Leszek the Black, and Bolesław the Pious.

In 1270 the new King Stephen V of Hungary visited Bolesław the Chaste in Kraków, where they signed an eternal peace. In the same year, Stephen V renewed the war against Bohemia for the Babenberg inheritance, which ended in the defeat of Hungary. In 1271 Bolesław, with the help of Rurikid princes, organized an expedition to the Duchy of Wrocław, because Henry the White was an ally of Bohemia.

King Stephen V died on 6 August 1272, and after this the alliance between Bolesław the Chaste and the Kingdom of Hungary was completely broken. In 1277 Bolesław finally made a peace treaty with Bohemia at Opava. With the new king of Hungary, Ladislaus IV, a minor, Bolesław became an ally of the Kingdom of Bohemia; however, during the conflict between Ottokar and King Rudolph I of Germany, he opted for the Hungarian side. On 26 August 1278 Bolesław was present in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed.

===Christianization of the Yotvingians===

One of the aims of Bolesław&#x27;s foreign policy was the Christianization of the Yotvingians. During 1248-1249 he organized an expedition against them, supported by Siemowit I. However, the expedition ended in failure.

Between 1256-1264 the Yotvingians invaded and plundered Lesser Poland. In the spring of 1264, Bolesław organized a retaliatory expedition against them, which ended with a victory of the Kraków-Sandomierz troops and the death of the Yotvingian prince Komata. For the Christianization of this tribe, Bolesław created a bishopric in Łuków on the northeastern border of Lesser Poland. In this cause he counted on the support of his sister Salomea and Pope Innocent IV, who in 1254 issued a special document. In the end the mission failed.

===Second Mongol invasion===

Prince Daniel of Galicia was at the side of Bolesław as an ally of Hungary in the conflict with the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1253 after the war with Bohemia, the relation between Bolesław and Daniel was good. Daniel visited Kraków, where he met the papal legate Opizo, who wanted to crown him. The coronation finally took place at Drohiczyn on the Bug River. Bolesław and his sister Salomea supported this event, because they wanted Daniel and his principality to acquire the Latin rite. The second Mongol invasion of Poland shattered those plans.

In November 1259 the Mongols and Ruthenians invaded and destroyed Sandomierz, Lublin and Kraków; Bolesław fled to either Hungary or Sieradz, ruled by Leszek the Black. In February 1260 the Mongols left Lesser Poland, and Bolesław then returned to his lands. At this point his relations with Daniel of Galicia improved; in 1262 they signed a treaty in Tarnawa.

After Daniel&#x27;s death in 1265 a Lithuanian-Russian army invaded and ravaged the Lesser Poland districts of Skaryszew, Tarczek, and Wiślica. During 1265−66 Bolesław fought against Daniel&#x27;s son Shvarn and brother Vasilko Romanovich, who helped the Lithuanians in their invasion into Lesser Poland. On 19 June 1266 Shvarn was defeated at the Battle of Wrota. The conflict ended in 1266, when Bolesław abandoned his expeditions to Yotvingia.

In July 1273 the Lithuanians invaded Lublin. In retaliation, Leszek the Black organized an expedition to Yotvingia in December of that year. In 1278 the Lithuanians again invaded Lublin, and they clashed with Leszek&#x27;s army at the Battle of Łuków.

===Adoption of Leszek the Black===

Because Bolesław and his wife Kinga made a vow of chastity, their marriage was childless. In 1265 Bolesław adopted Leszek the Black as his heir. In 1273 Władysław Opolski organized a military expedition to Kraków, because he refused to accept the adoption. On 4 June the Battle of Bogucin Mały took place, where the army from Opole-Racibórz was defeated. At the end of October, Bolesław made a retaliatory expedition against Opole-Racibórz; however, the forces were limited only to destroy specific areas of the duchy. In 1274 Władysław and Bolesław V the Chaste decided to conclude a peace, under which the Duke of Opole-Racibórz gave up his claims to the throne of Kraków.

===Internal policies===
Bolesław V paid particular attention to urban development. On 27 February 1253 he granted privileges to the city of Bochnia. On 5 June 1257 during a meeting at Kopernia near Pińczów, he granted the Magdeburg rights to the district of Kraków, and a year later to the city of Nowy Korczyn. In 1264, the city of Skaryszew also received the rights, and in 1271 during a meeting at Kraków, the city of Jędrzejów also obtained the rights. The implementation of the German-styled law led to the rapid economic development in the principality, which experienced losses, up to 75% in population alone, due to Mongol raids.

In addition, the reform in the administration of the salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka was noteworthy. In 1251 deposits of halite were discovered in Bochnia; previously, only brine had been found there. Bolesław V prompted the district to mine the salt, which became a source of regular income.

During his reign, Bolesław took special care of the church, and above all, to the Bishopric of Kraków. In 1245, thanks to the efforts of Bolesław&#x27;s sister Salomea, a Poor Clare monastery was founded in Zawichost. On 28 August 1252 during a meeting at Oględów, the Duke and his mother Grzymisława granted an immunity privilege to the Bishopric, which guaranteed to the local clergy greater autonomy in economic and judicial matters. On 17 September 1253, thanks to the joint efforts of Bolesław and the bishop of Kraków, Pope Innocent IV canonized Stanisław (Stanislaus) of Szczepanów. On 8 May 1254 celebrations were held in Kraków to honour Saint Stanislaus, including a meeting of the Piast princes. On 18 June another meeting took place at Chroberz, where Bolesław confirmed the privileges granted to the Bishopric of Kraków at Oględów. In 1257 a synod was held in Łęczyca, where it was established that any ruler who kidnapped a bishop would be automatically excommunicated, and his domains placed under the interdict. Between 11–12 June 1258 a meeting was held at Sandomierz, at which Bolesław approved further privileges for the Church in Lesser Poland. At the invitation of Bolesław V and his wife Kinga, the Franciscans came to Kraków around 1258.

==Death==

Bolesław the Chaste died on 7 December 1279. Jan Długosz recorded the event as follows:

::&quot;He was deeply grieved not only by his own people, but also by the neighboring nations because of the modesty and majesty that he showed.&quot;

His funeral took place three days later, on 10 December. He was buried in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Kraków. There is a gravestone with the inscription:

::&quot;Anno Domini MCCLXX obiit ilustrissimus princeps et dnus, Vladislaus dictus pius dux Cracov.&quot;

Kazimierz Stronczyński alleged that the gravestone was false, but the fact that contemporary sources established that Bolesław&#x27;s body was placed in the church, does not raise any objections.

After the death of her husband, Kinga entered the Poor Clares convent in Stary Sącz. By virtue of the previous agreement, Leszek II the Black inherited Kraków and Sandomierz.

==Church foundations==

In 1263 Bolesław founded a church dedicated to Mark the Evangelist in Kraków (pl: &quot;Kościół św. Marka w Krakowie&quot;) built in the Gothic style.

<text>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was an American big-box retail chain specializing in housewares, furniture, and specialty items. Headquartered in Union, New Jersey, the chain operated stores in the United States and Canada, and was once counted among the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 and the &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000. The chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April 2023 and liquidated all of its remaining stores, with the last closing on July 30, 2023. Following the retail chain&#x27;s liquidation, its name was adopted by online retailer Overstock.com which acquired Bed Bath and Beyond&#x27;s trademarks in a bankruptcy auction. The name is also still used by the chain&#x27;s former Mexican division which is now independent.

==Retail history==
Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein worked in management positions at discount store chain Arlan&#x27;s. As the company suffered financial difficulties, and the two believed that the market would shift toward specialty stores, they decided to leave and form their own company. In 1971, they opened a store in Springfield, New Jersey, called Bed &#x27;n Bath. By 1985, Eisenberg and Feinstein were operating 18 stores in the New York metropolitan area and California. Also in 1985, the first superstore was opened, as an attempt to remain competitive with Linens &#x27;n Things, Pacific Linen, and Luxury Linens. In order to properly represent the size increase in its retail stores, the company changed its name to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in 1987. 

=== Growth and acquisitions ===
By 1991, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had opened seven new superstores in New Jersey, California, Virginia, Illinois, Maryland, and Florida. The following June, the company made its IPO on the NASDAQ stock exchange. The company adopted integrated computer-based inventory management systems in 1993 to better compete with Linens ‘n Things, which had utilized computer inventory management since the late 1980s. The chain&#x27;s 100th store opened in Irvine, California, in October 1996; the 200th, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, followed less than three years later in August 1999. That year, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reached $1 billion in sales for the first time.

In 2002, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond acquired Harmon Discount Health &amp; Beauty, later renamed Harmon Face Values. Five years later in 2007, Bed Bath and Beyond acquired Buy Buy Baby, a chain of baby supply stores founded by Feinstein&#x27;s sons, and began international expansion, opening their first Canadian store in Richmond Hill, Ontario. By 2011, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had 1,142 stores. In 2012, Bed Bath and Beyond acquired Cost Plus World Market for $495 million.

In 2016, Bed Bath and Beyond acquired One Kings Lane, a luxury furniture e-commerce retailer; the following year, Bed Bath and Beyond acquired Decorist, an online interior design platform.

=== Decline ===
In March 2019, three activist investment firms—Legion Partners, Macellum Advisors, and Ancora Advisors—announced their intent to remove current CEO Steven Temares and restructure Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s current board of directors. The activist investors highlighted several instances of perceived nepotism, including the acquisition of Buy Buy Baby, which was founded by two of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond co-founder Leonard Feinstein&#x27;s children, and the acquisition of Chef Central, which was created by co-founder Warren Eisenberg&#x27;s son, as examples of poor business practices at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. This pressure led five independent directors to step down on April 22, 2019, and also resulted in the company restructuring its board to include only 10 directors instead of the previous 12 members.

On April 13, 2019, there was a report that the chain would close 40 stores but open 15 new locations.

On May 13, 2019, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced that CEO Steven Temares would step down &quot;effectively immediately&quot; and would resign his seat on the board of directors. Mary Winston, who had been appointed to the company&#x27;s board as a result of the activist investment firms&#x27; efforts, replaced Temares as interim CEO. On November 4, 2019, Mark Tritton, previously chief merchandising officer at Target, started as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s CEO.

To combat declining profitability, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which had for decades used coupon mailers and other promotional discounting tactics to attract consumers, announced in April 2019 that it would reduce its use of promotional coupons and tighten restrictions on their use. The chain also announced the development of new private label brands and concept stores.

As of 2019, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond operated approximately 1,530 stores in all 50 U.S. states, as well as in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. In addition to more than 1,020 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores, the company also operated approximately 280 Cost Plus World Markets, 100 Buy Buy Baby stores, roughly 80 Christmas Tree Shops, and more than 50 Harmon stores.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced in January 2021 that it would stop selling MyPillow, citing poor sales. The announcement came in the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, that CEO Mike Lindell supported conspiracy theories and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, and amidst similar announcements by Kohl&#x27;s and Wayfair.

==== Divestitures ====
Throughout 2020, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond sold many of its subsidiaries. First, in April, One Kings Lane was sold to CSC Generation. Later that year in October, the company announced plans to sell the 80-store Christmas Tree Shops chain, along with its Massachusetts distribution center, to Massachusetts-based Handil Holdings LLC; the acquisition was finalized the following month. Finally, in December 2020, the company also announced plans to sell Cost Plus World Market to Front Burner LP; that sale was later finalized in February 2021.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced in July 2020 that it planned to close more than 200 stores, about 21% of its fleet, over two years, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. 63 locations targeted for closure were named that September, followed by another 43 in January 2021. In January 2022, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced the closure of 37 more locations.

In March 2022, Ryan Cohen, former CEO of Chewy and a large shareholder of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, sent an open letter, as part of a Schedule 13D filing, to the Board of Directors calling for Buy Buy Baby to be sold or spun off at a favorable valuation. Subsequently, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reached a deal to give Cohen three board seats in exchange for his cooperation and the creation of a committee to execute his proposed plan. In July 2022, FCM BBBY Holdings, LLC, managed by Jake Freeman, also sent an open letter, as part of a Schedule 13G filing, asking the board of directors to consider their proposed plan to reduce Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s debt and improve liquidity through convertible bond issuance.

In July 2022, significant changes to the company&#x27;s executive leadership were announced: Mark Tritton would leave his role as president and chief executive officer, to be replaced by Sue Gove in an interim capacity. That August, the company announced that 20% of its corporate staff would be laid off, and 150 more stores would be closed. Gove was promoted to permanent president and CEO the following October.

On September 2, 2022, Gustavo Arnal, the company&#x27;s chief financial officer, committed suicide, jumping from the balcony of his New York City apartment. Arnal was one of the targets of a class action lawsuit alleging that Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s stock had become a pump-and-dump scheme. Two weeks later on September 16, the company named 56 stores targeted for closure of the 150 announced in August; later, on September 26, the company announced the closure of Decorist.

=== Bankruptcy and liquidation ===
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond opened in 2023 by warning investors that it might not survive the year. On January 5, 2023 shares of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond plunged almost 30% on the stock market, and Bed Bath and Beyond announced it had &quot;substantial doubt&quot; in being able to continue to operate as a business. Wall Street analysts predicted that Bed Bath and Beyond could file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as January 7, 2023 On January 9, 2023, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond hired AlixPartners as a restructuring adviser, and announced the closure of 62 more stores.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced on January 26, 2023 that some banks had cut its line of credit. The next day, it was revealed that Bed Bath and Beyond would shutter its Harmon Face Values chain, closing all 52 of its stores, and would also close five Buy Buy Baby stores and 87 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations, including the last location in West Virginia.

On February 7, 2023, Hudson Bay Capital Management and several other investors arranged a death spiral financing deal to raise over $1 billion to help the company avoid bankruptcy, though most analysts at the time identified that such a deal would merely turn a possible Chapter 7 bankruptcy into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 

On February 10, 2023, it was revealed the company would shutter its Canadian division, closing all 54 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and 11 Buy Buy Baby stores in Canada. According to court documents, the business does not have the &quot;capacity or ability to independently effect a recapitalization or restructuring of the Canadian operations without access to cash and the support&quot;. The same day, they also announced 149 more store closures in the United States, including the last two locations in Wyoming.

Bed Bath &amp; Beyond announced on March 30 2023 that if it was unable to sell $300 million in stock, Bed Bath and Beyond would likely file for bankruptcy. In addition it also terminated its fundraising deal with Hudson Bay Capital Management.

On April 23, 2023, after failing to pay off stock, declining sales, high debt, and years of struggling, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Buy Buy Baby, and 73 affiliated debtors and entities officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. It was later confirmed that all remaining Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Buy Buy Baby stores in the United States would close unless a buyer was found for the chain. Even if the company could find a buyer, shareholders could be expected to be wiped out, with proceeds from the liquidation going to secured creditors and bondholders. By May 3, 2023, Bed Bath and Beyond&#x27;s stock was delisted from the Nasdaq exchange.

Following the bankruptcy filing, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stopped accepting their popular coupons on April 26, 2023 and liquidation sales commenced at all remaining stores the next day. Shortly thereafter, numerous other retailers, including The Container Store, Big Lots, Boscov&#x27;s, and Kirkland&#x27;s, announced that they would honor unused Bed Bath &amp; Beyond coupons for a limited time. Liquidation sales continued through June 2023 and July 2023, with the last stores closing permanently on July 30, 2023.

Industry analysts attribute Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s failure to a number of factors, including a late entry to e-commerce, reduction in merchandise selection and quality, supply chain issues, competition from Walmart, Target, and HomeGoods, and debt accrued from stock buybacks. The latter is widely considered the largest reason for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond&#x27;s collapse, as the company&#x27;s stock buyback schemes, in practice since 2004, were the source of much of its $5.2 billion debt. This resulted in an inability to pay vendors on time, which led many to halt merchandise shipments to Bed Bath and Beyond.

====Acquisition by Overstock.com and online revival====
In a June 2023 bankruptcy auction, Overstock.com acquired the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond name, and associated intellectual property, in a $21.5 million stalking-horse bid. Shortly thereafter, Overstock publicly announced its intention to rebrand its own operations under the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond name after the acquisition closes. It did so on August 1, 2023, two days after the last brick-and-mortar Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores shuttered.

The acquisition did not include the now distant Buy Buy Baby brand, as bids were still being solicited for a separate sale of the chain until July; after no satisfactory bids were received, Buy Buy Baby&#x27;s name and intellectual property were instead auctioned. Buy Buy Baby was eventually sold to New Jersey-based Dream on Me for $15.5 million, who had plans to reopen up to 120 stores over the next few years. However, all stores were closed by the end of 2024 to focus on online operations.

Following the sale of the brand to Overstock, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Inc. changed its name to 20230930-DK-Butterfly-1, Inc. and cancelled its stock on September 29, 2023.

====Revival of Canadian stores as Rooms + Spaces and Babies &quot;R&quot; Us====
The retailer&#x27;s last Canadian stores closed four days earlier than planned in late April 2023. Following the closure of the chain&#x27;s operations in Canada, Doug Putman, owner of Sunrise Records and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Canada, acquired 21 former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond locations, with plans to revive the chain in Canada as Rooms + Spaces, under the leadership of former Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Canada general manager Greg Dyer. Putman also opened the first two stand-alone Babies &quot;R&quot; Us locations in Canada, in Edmonton in former Buy Buy Baby locations. The first Rooms + Spaces and stand-alone Babies &quot;R&quot; Us locations opened in July 2023.

Most stores were closed after being open for only a few months, as the leases were defaulted. As of February 2024, only two Rooms + Spaces locations remained open (at West Edmonton Mall and Brantford.)

As of January 2025 all Rooms + Spaces locations are permanently closed and so is their website
Leases for other locations in Canada were acquired by other retailers, including Mark&#x27;s and Pro Hockey Life.

==== Christmas Tree Shops bankruptcy ====
On May 5, 2023, Christmas Tree Shops also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, despite having been separated from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond two years prior. The now-independent chain later announced in July that it would liquidate; its last stores closed on August 12, 2023, two weeks after Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

<text>Yvon Durelle (October 14, 1929 – January 6, 2007), was a Canadian champion boxer. He was of Acadian descent.

==Early life==
Durelle grew up in a family of fourteen children, in Baie-Ste-Anne, a small Acadian fishing village on Miramichi Bay on the Atlantic coast. Like many others of his generation, he left school at an early age to work on a fishing boat. In his spare time, Durelle liked to box and while still working in the fishery, he began prize fighting on weekends.

== Career ==
Billed as &quot;The Fighting Fisherman&quot;, Durelle began his professional career in 1948, boxing at various venues around the province of New Brunswick. By August 1950, Yvon showed only one defeat in twenty three starts, the lone blemish a loss by disqualification, to Billy Snowball. Over time he was gaining a reputation as a tough opponent with a hard punch. A large fan following in Chatham, one in Newcastle and as well in Fredericton resulted in a groundswell of popularity as his victories eventually made him one of the top ranked middleweight fighters in Canada.

=== Light Heavyweight ===
In May 1953, Durelle won the Canadian middleweight championship. He defended his title, winning 8 straight bouts. He moved up in weight class to fight in the light heavyweight division.

In his first fight against a heavier and stronger opponent, he defeated the Canadian champion to take the light-heavyweight title. The following year, he fought outside his native Canada for the first time, going to Brooklyn, New York to fight Floyd Patterson, an up-and-coming American Golden Gloves champion. Outpointed in 8 rounds by the man who soon became the heavyweight champion of the world, Durelle&#x27;s strong performance in a losing cause against Patterson gained him wide respect in the international boxing world.

In New York City in March 1957, Durelle broke into the top ten world rankings with a 10-round decision over Angelo Defendis. In May he won the British Empire light-heavyweight championship and the following month fought the top-ranked contender in the world, Tony Anthony. In a fight most experts say he won handily, Durelle was given only a draw against the heavily favored Anthony but it elevated him to the number 3 ranking in the world. He became a much talked about sports personality in his native country after he beat the German champion, Willi Besmanoff. In 1958, he defeated Clarence Hinnant, regarded by many as one of the best all around boxers of the time. The victory provided Durelle with the opportunity for his first chance to fight for a world title.

==== Title Fight ====
Durelle&#x27;s light-heavyweight championship fight against the great Archie Moore on December 10, 1958, at the Forum in Montreal, Quebec, is one of the most memorable fights in boxing history. Listed as a 4-to-1 underdog, Durelle became a legend in Canada after the bout. In one of the first fights broadcast coast-to-coast on American television, Durelle stunned boxing patrons by knocking the champion down 3 times in the first round. Under boxing rules today (except those of the World Boxing Council), the fight would have been stopped after three knockdowns in one round and Durelle would have been world champion. Also, he missed an opportunity when, after the first knockdown, he stood over Moore watching for several seconds before returning to his corner. As a result of his delay, the referee had to wait to begin the count, and Moore made it to his feet at the count of nine. Durelle would have likely won if he had gone to his corner. Durelle swarmed all over the champion for four more rounds and knocked him to the canvas again in round five but Moore held on and eventually wore Durelle down to retain his world championship with an eleventh-round knockout. The fight was the talk of the boxing world and members of the Canadian press voted it the sporting event of the year. In an interview in 1994, Archie Moore, upon recounting the fight still hailed as classic, had this to say: &quot;As the fight wore on and I got stronger, I thought to myself that this fella was the toughest man I&#x27;d ever fought. I turned professional in 1936 and fought until 1965--229 bouts. And I still think Durelle was the toughest man I ever faced.&quot;

===From Boxing to Wrestling and back===
Six months later, in June 1959, at Durelle&#x27;s home village of Baie-Ste-Anne, thirty-five fishermen died when they were swept out to sea by 40-foot tidal waves that pounded the wharf. Distraught at the loss of friends and relatives, in August he lost in a world title fight rematch with Archie Moore by a third-round knockout. In November of that year he lost in 12 rounds to the Canadian heavyweight champion, George Chuvalo. Durelle fought only a few more times, before taking up professional wrestling in 1961. He returned to boxing in 1963 winning twice more before retiring permanently. He continued to earn a living at wrestling, primarily in eastern Canada but on occasion with Stu Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling, in Calgary, Alberta. He would retire from wrestling in 1973.

==Later life and death==
Despite his size and brutal profession, Durelle is often referred to as a modest and gentle man (his nickname was &quot;doux&quot;, meaning &quot;soft&quot;). However, in the 1970s an event profoundly impacted him and his family when, in a bar that he owned and operated, he shot and killed a man who had attacked him. Charged with murder, he was defended by a young lawyer by the name of Frank McKenna and was acquitted on the grounds of self-defence. The trial received massive and sustained publicity and McKenna eventually went into politics and was elected premier of the province of New Brunswick.

Retired in his native village, a small museum with souvenirs of his twenty-year boxing career was built attached to his home where he and his wife of more than fifty years greeted fans who still showed up to see the New Brunswick boxer. In an article for ESPN.com about the most memorable matches in boxing history, current-day referee Mills Lane said: &quot;&quot;I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever see a fight like Durelle-Moore again...That fight transcended what great fights are&quot;.&quot;

Durelle incurred a stroke on December 25, 2006, and died at age 77 on January 6, 2007, at the Moncton Hospital in Moncton, New Brunswick. He also had Parkinson&#x27;s disease prior to this. His funeral was held on January 11, 2007, from Ste-Anne Roman Catholic Church in Baie-Ste-Anne, New Brunswick.

<text>The Village at Black Creek, previously Black Creek Pioneer Village, and before that Dalziel Pioneer Park, is an open-air heritage museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The village is located in the North York district of Toronto, just west of York University and southeast of the Jane and Steeles intersection. It overlooks Black Creek, a tributary of the Humber River. The village is a recreation of life in 19th-century Ontario and gives an idea how rural Ontario might have looked in the early-to-mid-19th century. The village is a regular destination for field trips by schoolchildren from the Greater Toronto Area. It was opened in 1960 and is operated by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority.

Napier Simpson, a restoration architect in Ontario devoted his professional life to raising public awareness of the importance of heritage conservation including the Black Creek Pioneer Village project.

==Collection==
The pioneer village consists of over forty 19th century buildings, decorated in the style of the 1860s with period furnishings. It is operated by historical interpreters and craftspeople housed in the restored buildings. The site also features historical re-enactments and visiting artisans, along with an annual Mennonite fair. Buildings include the Dalziel Barn, period houses, the original Stong family farm buildings, a water-powered grist mill, a general store, a blacksmith&#x27;s shop along with over ten other trades buildings, a hotel, a church, and a one-room schoolhouse. A core of buildings built by the Stong family are on their original sites, while others have been moved in from across Southern Ontario.

The majority of the buildings were moved from their original sites (notably the large Halfway House and Mennonite Meeting House), and some re-built on their current locations. The board and batten blacksmith shop was originally built in the 1850s in Nobleton. The gunsmith shop was built in Bolton, and the Taylor Cooperage building was built in the 1850s in Paris. The weaver shop is within what was originally a Temperance Hall built in Kettleby in 1850 by the Sons of Temperance. The Roblin Mill has been relocated from Ameliasburgh.

==Affiliations==
The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.

==Future==
Ontario premier Doug Ford said on August 23, 2019, that the Ontario government has no plans to close the village, despite the government&#x27;s instructions to conservation authorities in Ontario to wind down activities unrelated to protecting watersheds and drinking water or preventing floods.

In September 2023, Black Creek Pioneer Village announced that it would be renamed the Village at Black Creek by the first quarter of 2024. The decision was made by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) Board of Directors. The facility will also be expanding its museum and visitor centre.

<doc id="517548" wikidata="Q741545" url="?curid=517548" title="Mu'in al-Din Chishti">
<text>Mu&#x27;in al-Din Hasan Chishti Sijzi (; February 1143 – March 1236), known reverentially as Khawaja Gharib Nawaz (), was a Persian Islamic scholar and mystic from Sistan, who eventually ended up settling in the Indian subcontinent in the early 13th-century, where he promulgated the Chishtiyya order of Sunni mysticism. This particular &quot;Tariqa&quot; (order) became the dominant Islamic spiritual order in medieval India. Most of the Indian Sunni saints are Chishti in their affiliation, including Nizamuddin Awliya (d. 1325) and Amir Khusrow (d. 1325).

Having arrived in Delhi Sultanate during the reign of the sultan Iltutmish (d. 1236), Muʿīn al-Dīn moved from Delhi to Ajmer shortly thereafter, at which point he became increasingly influenced by the writings of the Sunni Hanbali scholar and mystic ʿAbdallāh Anṣārī (d. 1088), whose work on the lives of the early Islamic saints, the &quot;Ṭabāqāt al-ṣūfiyya&quot;, may have played a role in shaping Muʿīn al-Dīn&#x27;s worldview. It was during his time in Ajmer that Muʿīn al-Dīn acquired the reputation of being a charismatic and compassionate spiritual preacher and teacher; and biographical accounts of his life written after his death report that he received the gifts of many &quot;spiritual marvels (&quot;karāmāt&quot;), such as miraculous travel, clairvoyance, and visions of angels&quot; in these years of his life. Muʿīn al-Dīn seems to have been unanimously regarded as a great saint after his death.

Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī&#x27;s legacy rests primarily on his having been &quot;one of the most outstanding figures in the annals of Islamic mysticism.&quot; Additionally, Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī is also notable, according to John Esposito, for having been one of the first major Islamic mystics to formally allow his followers to incorporate the &quot;use of music&quot; in their devotions, liturgies, and hymns to God, which he did in order to make the &#x27;foreign&#x27; Arab faith more relatable to the indigenous peoples who had recently entered the religion.

==Early life==
Of Persian descent, Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī was born in 1143 in Sistan. He was sixteen years old when his father, Sayyid G̲h̲iyāt̲h̲ al-Dīn (d. c. 1155), died, leaving his grinding mill and orchard to his son.

Despite planning to continue his father&#x27;s business, he developed mystic tendencies in his personal piety and soon entered a life of destitute itineracy. He enrolled at the seminaries of Bukhara and Samarkand, and (probably) visited the shrines of Muhammad al-Bukhari (d. 870) and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. 944), two widely venerated figures in the Islamic world.

While traveling to Iran, in the district of Nishapur, he came across the Sunni mystic Ḵh̲wāj̲a ʿUt̲h̲mān, who initiated him. Accompanying his spiritual guide for over twenty years on the latter&#x27;s journeys from region to region, Muʿīn al-Dīn also continued his own independent spiritual travels during the time period. It was on his independent wanderings that Muʿīn al-Dīn encountered many of the most notable Sunni mystics of the era, including Abdul-Qadir Gilani (d. 1166) and Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1221), as well as Naj̲īb al-Dīn ʿAbd al-Ḳāhir Suhrawardī, Abū Saʿīd Tabrīzī, and ʿAbd al-Waḥid G̲h̲aznawī (all d. c. 1230), all of whom were destined to become some of the most highly venerated saints in the Sunni tradition.

==South Asia==
Arriving in South Asia in the early thirteenth century along with his cousin and spiritual successor Khwaja Syed Fakhr Al-Dīn Gardezi Chishti, Muʿīn al-Dīn first travelled to Lahore to meditate at the tomb-shrine of the Sunni mystic and jurist Ali Hujwiri (d. 1072).

From Lahore, he continued towards Ajmer, where he settled and married the daughter of Saiyad Wajiuddin, whom he married in the year 1209/10. He went on to have three sons—Abū Saʿīd, Fak̲h̲r al-Dīn and Ḥusām al-Dīn — and one daughter, Bībī Jamāl.After settling in Ajmer, Muʿīn al-Dīn strove to establish the Chishti order of Sunni mysticism in India; many later biographic accounts relate the numerous miracles wrought by God at the hands of the saint during this period.

===Preaching in India===

Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī was not the originator or founder of the Chishtiyya order of mysticism as he is often erroneously thought to be. On the contrary, the Chishtiyya was already an established Sufi order prior to his birth, being originally an offshoot of the older Adhamiyya order that traced its spiritual lineage and titular name to the early Islamic saint and mystic Ibrahim ibn Adham (d. 782). Thus, this particular branch of the Adhamiyya was renamed the Chishtiyya after the 10th-century Sunni mystic Abū Isḥāq al-Shāmī (d. 942) migrated to Chishti Sharif, a town in the present day Herat Province of Afghanistan in around 930, in order to preach Islam in that area about 148 years prior to the birth of the founder of the Qadiriyya sufi order, Shaikh Abdul Qadir Gilani. The order spread into the Indian subcontinent, however, at the hands of the Persian Muʿīn al-Dīn in the 13th-century, after the saint is believed to have had a dream in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad appeared and told him to be his &quot;representative&quot; or &quot;envoy&quot; in India.

According to the various chronicles, Muʿīn al-Dīn&#x27;s tolerant and compassionate behavior towards the local population seems to have been one of the major reasons behind conversion to Islam at his hand. Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī is said to have appointed Bakhtiar Kaki (d. 1235) as his spiritual successor, who worked at spreading the Chishtiyya in Delhi. Furthermore, Muʿīn al-Dīn&#x27;s son, Fakhr al-Dīn (d. 1255), is said to have further spread the order&#x27;s teachings in Ajmer, whilst another of the saint&#x27;s major disciples, Ḥamīd al-Dīn Ṣūfī Nāgawrī (d. 1274), preached in Nagaur, Rajasthan.

==Spiritual lineage==

As with every other major Sufi order, the Chishtiyya proposes an unbroken spiritual chain of transmitted knowledge going back to Muhammad through one of his companions, which in the Chishtiyya&#x27;s case is Ali (d. 661). His spiritual lineage is traditionally given as follows:

# Muhammad (570 – 632), 
# ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib (600 – 661), 
# Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (d. 728), 
# Abdul Wahid bin Zaid (d. 786), 
# al-Fuḍayl b. ʿIyāḍ (d. 803),
# Ibrahim ibn Adham al-Balkhī (d. 783),
# Khwaja Sadid ad-Din Huzaifa al-Marashi (d. 823),
# Abu Hubayra al-Basri (d. 895),
# Khwaja Mumshad Uluw Al Dīnawarī(d. 911), 
# Abu Ishaq Shami (d. 941), 
# Abu Aḥmad Abdal Chishti (d. 966), 
# Abu Muḥammad Chishti (d. 1020), 
# Abu Yusuf ibn Saman Muḥammad Samʿān Chishtī (d. 1067), 
# Maudood Chishti (d. 1133), 
# Shareef Zandani (d. 1215), 
# Usman Harooni (d. 1220).
==Dargah Sharif==
The tomb (&quot;dargāh&quot;) of Muʿīn al-Dīn became a deeply venerated site in the century following the preacher&#x27;s death in March 1236. Honoured by members of all social classes, the tomb was treated with great respect by many of the era&#x27;s most important Sunni rulers, including Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi from 1324 to 1351, who visited the tomb in 1332 to commemorate the memory of the saint. In a similar way, the later Mughal emperor Akbar (d. 1605) visited the shrine no less than fourteen times during his reign. 

In the present day, the tomb of Muʿīn al-Dīn continues to be one of the most popular sites of religious visitation for Sunni Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, with over &quot;hundreds of thousands of people from all over the Indian sub-continent assembling there on the occasion of [the saint&#x27;s] &quot;ʿurs&quot; or death anniversary.&quot; Additionally, the site also attracts many Hindus, who have also venerated the Islamic saint since the medieval period. A bomb planted was planted on 11 October 2007 in the Dargah of Sufi Saint Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti at the time of Iftar had left three pilgrims dead and 15 injured. A special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Jaipur punished with life imprisonment the two convicts in the 2007 Ajmer Dargah bomb blast case.

==Popular culture==
Indian films about the saint and his dargah at Ajmer include &quot;Mere Gharib Nawaz&quot; by G. Ishwar, &quot;Sultan E Hind&quot; (1973) by K. Sharif, &quot;Khawaja Ki Diwani&quot; (1981) by Akbar Balam and &quot;Mere Data Garib Nawaz&quot; (1994) by M Gulzar Sultani. A song in the 2008 Indian film &quot;Jodhaa Akbar&quot; named &quot;Khwaja Mere Khwaja&quot;, composed by A. R. Rahman, pays tribute to Muʿīn al-Dīn Chishtī.

Various qawwalis portray devotion to the saint including Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan&#x27;s &quot;Khwaja E Khwajgan&quot;, Sabri Brothers&#x27; &quot;Khawaja Ki Deewani&quot;and Koji Badayuni&#x27;s &quot;Kabhi rab se Mila Diya&quot;.

<text> () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris, between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Le Bourget Airport.

==Name==
The name Le Blanc-Mesnil was recorded for the first time in the 11th century as . This name is a compound of Medieval Latin , meaning &#x27;little houses&#x27;, from Latin (accusative ), and of Germanic (Old Frankish) , , meaning &#x27;glossy, shining, white&#x27;, which gave French (&#x27;white&#x27;) and English &quot;blank&quot;.

The name is interpreted by some as a reference to the houses of Le Blanc-Mesnil which were whitened due to the flour dust coming from the windmills located there in ancient times. One researcher, however, thinks that had also the meaning of &#x27;free&#x27; in Old French, and so the name would mean &#x27;free mesnil, free village&#x27;, perhaps because the villagers had been freed from serfdom. None of these interpretations is certain.

<text>The New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame () is a provincial sports hall of fame and museum in Fredericton, New Brunswick. The sports hall of fame honours athletes, teams, and sport builders that are from the Canadian province of New Brunswick. New nominees to the hall of fame are inducted to the hall of fame on an annual basis.

Established in 1970, the organization operates as an independent non-profit charity with a mandate to &quot;preserve and celebrate&quot; the sports heritage of New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame museum holds exhibits about inducted builders, individual athletes, and groups/teams.

==Museum==
The Sports Hall of Fame operates a Sports Museum at 503 Queen Street in the province&#x27;s capital city of Fredericton. The museum is situated within the John Thurston Clark Memorial Building. The museum is equipped with interactive exhibits and one of the largest collection of charcoal portraits in the province, one for each of its Hall of Fame inductees.

The building was originally opened as a customs and post office in 1881. The building was later named after the son of William George Clark, the Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick. The New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame moved into the John Thurston Clark Memorial Building in 1976.

==Hall of Famers==

<text>Bondy () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris, in the Seine-Saint-Denis department.

==Name==
The name Bondy was recorded for the first time around AD 600 as &quot;Bonitiacum&quot;, meaning &quot;estate of Bonitius&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner.

==History==

During the Middle Ages, Bondy was mostly forest, and the forest of Bondy was a well-known haunt of bandits and robbers and was considered extremely dangerous.

On 3 January 1905, a third of the territory of Bondy was detached and became the commune of Les Pavillons-sous-Bois.

On 30 October 2007, a gas explosion killed one person and injured 47 people.

Bondy and its integration into Paris is the subject of part of the second-last chapter of Graham Robb&#x27;s book &quot;Parisians&quot;.

==Administration==
Bondy is part of the canton of Bondy, created in 2015.

==Transport==
Bondy is served by Bondy station on Paris RER line E and the Line 4 (T4) of the Tramways in Île-de-France.

<doc id="517563" wikidata="Q1479399" url="?curid=517563" title="Hash (food)">
<text>Hash is a dish consisting of chopped meat, potatoes, and fried onions. The name is allegedly derived from , meaning &#x27;to chop&#x27;. It originated as a way to use up leftovers. In the U.S. by the 1860s, a cheap restaurant was called a &quot;hash house&quot; or &quot;hashery.&quot; 

Canned corned beef hash became especially popular in countries such as Britain and France allegedly during and after the Second World War as rationing limited the availability of fresh meat. 

Hash may be served for breakfast, lunch, or supper. When served for breakfast in America or the United States of America hash may come with eggs, toast, hollandaise sauce, or baked beans. 

High-end restaurants offer sophisticated hash dishes on their menus. Modern preparations have been made with unconventional ingredients such as lamb, fish, venison, turkey, chicken, shrimp, or steak.

== United States ==

&quot;Hash&quot; of many forms was part of the American diet since at least the 18th century, as is attested by the availability of numerous recipes and the existence of many &quot;hash houses&quot; named after the dish. In the United States, September 27 is &quot;National Corned Beef Hash Day&quot;.

Classic American corned beef hash originated in the New England region of the United States as a way to use up the leftovers from a traditional boiled dinner of beef, cabbage, potatoes, and onions. A red flannel hash is made with the addition of beets. Fish hash, including salt cod hash, has been observed in historical New England cuisine.

Corned beef and cabbage dinners are an Irish-American tradition from the 1800s that are now commonly held across the United States on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. Corned beef hash is also commonly served on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, as well as around American Thanksgiving and Christmas. 

In the Midwest it was common to bind a hash together with a white sauce thickened with flour.

Alternatively, in the southern United States, the term &quot;hash&quot; may refer to two dishes:
* A Southern traditional stew of pork and offal served over rice.
* In Texas, a thick stew made up of pork, chicken and beef, traditionally seasoned with salt and pepper and other spices, is reduced overnight over an open flame in an iron washpot or hashpot.

== UK ==
As early as the 14th century, English people were making hache or hachy. According to cookbook author Steven Raichlen, &quot;The English diarist Samuel Pepys waxed grandiloquent about a rabbit hash he savored in 1662&quot;.

An 18th century recipe for &quot;excellent hash&quot; was made by preparing a seasoned roux with herbs and onion, cayenne, mace and nutmeg, then adding to it broth or gravy and stirring in mushroom ketchup. In this sauce the cold beef would be simmered over gentle heat. Simpler recipes would omit some of the fancier ingredients like mushroom ketchup and add filling root vegetables like carrots and boiled potatoes.

&quot;Norman hash&quot; was a dish of gravy and onions served over slices of leftover roast beef.

== Other countries ==
Hash in Denmark, known in Danish as (roughly translated, &#x27;tossed together food&#x27;), is a traditional leftover dish usually made with pork, potato, and onion, and served with a fried egg, Worcestershire sauce, pickled red beet slices, and ketchup or Bearnaise sauce. The coarsely-diced ingredients, rather than being mashed into a paste, are readily discernible in their cooked form. A beef variant is known as &quot;Royal hash&quot;, and a Southern Jutland regional dish including cream and served over pommes frites as &quot;King Frederik&#x27;s favorite&quot;. 

In Sweden, there is a version of hash called (&#x27;small-pieces-in-pan&#x27;) and in Finland, and Norway, . It is similar to the Danish version. The Swedish variety calls specifically for beef instead of other meats and adding cream to the hash. It is named after Sweden&#x27;s 18th century national poet Carl Michael Bellman.

In Austria and perhaps more specifically Tyrol, there exists a similar dish called , usually consisting of chopped leftover meats (often being pork sausage), potato and onions fried with herbs (typically marjoram and parsley) and then served topped with a fried egg.

In Slovenia, it is called and very often used as a spaghetti sauce. It is made out of minced pork and veal meat, potato sauce, onion, garlic, flour and spices.

In Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American cuisines, there is a similar dish called (Spanish) or (Portuguese). It is made with ground meat (usually beef), tomatoes (tomato sauce may be used as a substitute), vegetables and spices that vary by region (the Portuguese and Brazilian version is generally , very heavy on garlic, in the form of an aioli called , and often also heavy on onion and bell peppers). It is often served with rice (it can be fried in aioli if those who will eat have a strong fondness for garlic), as well as okra, in the form of —okra fried in an aioli , just as the hash itself and the collard greens used in feijoada—in Brazil, there constituting a staple) or used as a filling in dishes such as tacos, tostadas, or as a regular breakfast hash with eggs and tortillas (not in Brazil and Portugal). In Brazil and Portugal, it is used as bolognese sauce for pasta, and also used as a filling for pancake rolls, pastel (Brazilian pastry empanada), &quot;empadão&quot; and others (not with okra as it is far too perishable to be used in a fill for fast food and its consumption together with wheat flour-based foods often does not fit cultural tastes). The name comes from the West Iberian (Spanish, Leonese and Portuguese) infinitive verb , which means &#x27;to mince&#x27; or &#x27;to chop&#x27;.

In the Philippines, hash is similar to that of Spanish and American versions. Commonly called , it is known as breakfast fare for it includes corned beef, onions, and potatoes. Another variant, called &quot;pork&quot; ( meaning &#x27;ground&#x27;) or is similar to , and includes carrots, potatoes, and hard boiled egg in tomato sauce. 

In Germany, is made with beef or corned beef minced with onions and boiled potatoes and fried in lard. Beetroot and herring may be added, or served as a side dish.

<doc id="517580" wikidata="Q209086" url="?curid=517580" title="Pantin">
<text>Pantin () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, Île-de-France, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. In 2019 its population was estimated to be 59,846. Pantin is located on the edge of the city of Paris and is mainly formed by a plain crossed by national roadway 2 and 3, the Paris–Strasbourg railway line and the canal de l&#x27;Ourcq.

==Geography==
Pantin borders the Paris Boulevard Périphérique, an inner ring road, and is traversed by national routes N2 and N3, as well as the Paris-Strasbourg railway line and the Ourcq canal.

==Urbanism==
===Typology===
Pantin is an urban commune, as it is one of the dense or intermediate density communes, as defined by the Insee communal density grid. It belongs to the urban unit of Paris, an inter-departmental conurbation comprising 407 communes and 10,785,092 inhabitants in 2017, of which it is a suburban commune.

The commune is also part of the functional area of Paris where it is located in the main population and employment centre of the functional area. This area comprises 1,929 communes.

===Urban morphology===
The main quarters or neighborhoods of the commune are:

* Mairie - Hoche
* Quatre-Chemins
* Petit Pantin - Les Limites
* Église
* Les Courtillières

===Development projects===
Jacqueline Osty, winner of the &quot;Grand Prix de l&#x27;urbanisme&quot; in 2020, designed the of public spaces on the port site. She has forged a common base, preserving a continuous, mineral spirit, evocative of the port area&#x27;s past, with a light use of vegetation in the form of long, straight grassed lines and green lounges between the housing developments.

==Toponymy==
The name Pantin was recorded for the first time in 1067 as &quot;Pentini&quot;, perhaps from the Roman patronym Pentinus, a variant of Pantaenus or Repentinus, but this etymology is not certain.

The first known deed in which the name Penthinum appears is a deed from the 11th century granting the Pantin estate to the Saint-Martin-des-Champs Priory.

The name of Pantin is mentioned in the following forms: 
* &quot;Pentinus&quot; in 1082; 
* &quot;Pantinum&quot; in 1119; 
* &quot;Pentin&quot; in 1151-1157; 
* &quot;Pantin&quot; in 1256; 
* &quot;Panthino&quot; in 1352; 
* &quot;Panthin&quot; in 1499; 
* &quot;Penthin&quot; in 1520; 
* &quot;Pentin&quot; in 1598.

In 2023 the name was changed symbolically to Pantine, with an added &quot;e&quot; ending to indicate the feminine form and promote awareness of women&#x27;s issues.

==History==
On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, a small part of the commune of Pantin was annexed to Paris.

On 24 July 1867, a part of the territory of Pantin was detached and merged with a part of the territory of Romainville and a part of the territory of Bagnolet to create the commune of Les Lilas.

By 1875, the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq (Ourcq canal) and new railway lines served to divide the town into two parts—the &quot;Village&quot; and the &quot;Quatre Chemins&quot;.

===Heraldry===
==Future==
The construction of a science park along the Bassin de la Villette on the former site of city abattoirs has improved pedestrian access to Paris, as well as encouraging urban regeneration in Pantin itself. A key policy discussed since the 2008 mayoral election has been the possibility of integrating the ten banlieue towns of Bagnolet, Les Lilas, Le Pré-Saint-Gervais, Romainville, Pantin, Noisy-le-Sec, Montreuil, Bobigny, Bondy and Rosny-sous-Bois into an &quot;intercommune&quot; of around 440,000 people. This new municipality could be created as early as January 2010. This project was implemented, it gathers nine communes. In 2016, Pantin was declared France&#x27;s most polluted town by the World Health Organization.

<doc id="517594" wikidata="Q626478" url="?curid=517594" title="Radioligand">
<text>A radioligand is a microscopic particle which consists of a therapeutic radioactive isotope and the cell-targeting compound - the ligand. The ligand is the target binding site, it may be on the surface of the targeted cancer cell for therapeutic purposes. Radioisotopes can occur naturally or be synthesized and produced in a cyclotron/nuclear reactor. The different types of radioisotopes include Y-90, H-3, C-11, Lu-177, Ac-225, Ra-223, In-111, I-131, I-125, etc. Thus, radioligands must be produced in special nuclear reactors for the radioisotope to remain stable. Radioligands can be used to analyze/characterize receptors, to perform binding assays, to help in diagnostic imaging, and to provide targeted cancer therapy. Radiation is a novel method of treating cancer and is effective in short distances along with being unique/personalizable and causing minimal harm to normal surrounding cells. Furthermore, radioligand binding can provide information about receptor-ligand interactions in vitro and in vivo. Choosing the right radioligand for the desired application is important. The radioligand must be radiochemically pure, stable, and demonstrate a high degree of selectivity, and high affinity for their target.

== History ==

Wilhelm Roentgen is credited with the discovery of radioactivity in 1895 with many others such as Antoine Henri Becquerel, Pierre Curie, and Marie Curie following closely behind to further advance the field of radioactivity. John Lawrence, a physicist at The University of California Berkeley, first used nuclear medicine in humans came in 1936 after extensive use of radioactive phosphorus in mouse models. Often called the father of nuclear medicine, Lawrence treated a leukemia patient with radiophosphorus, which was the first time a radioactive isotope has been used to treat human patients. Another pioneer in the field, Sam Seidlin, in partnership with Saul Hertz, treated a case of thyroid cancer with radioactive iodine (I-131) 1946. In the 1950s, nuclear medicine began to gain traction as a medical specialty with the Society of Nuclear Medicine forming in 1954 and later releasing the first copy of the Journal of Nuclear Medicine in 1960. The use of radioligands and nuclear tagging started to gain popularity in in the early 1960s when Elwood Jensen and Herbert Jacobsen (1962) and later Jack Gorksi, David Toft, G, Shymala, Donald Smith, and Angelo Notides (1968) attempted to identify the estrogen receptor. The American Medical Association (AMA) officially recognized Nuclear Medicine as a medical specialty in 1970 and the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was established in 1972. Progress came quickly in 1973 when Edward Hoffman, Michael M. Ter-Pogossian, and Michael E. Phelps invented the first PET camera for human use. The 1980s brought early radioligand studies for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) which continued into the early 2000s. In 2017 the European Union (EU) approved the use of radioligand therapy for NETs with the U.S. following close behind in 2018.

== Radioactive isotopes commonly used ==

== Ligands ==

A ligand is a molecule utilized for cell-signaling that binds to a target tissue for cellular communication. There are many different types of ligands including: internal receptors, cell-surface receptors, Ion-channel receptors, G-Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), and enzyme-linked receptors. Ligands can be divided into two categories, agonists or antagonists. Agonists behave similarly to natural ligands, while antagonists are inhibitors and block the binding of the natural ligand. There are many different subtypes of agonists, including endogenous agonists, super agonist, full agonist, inverse agonist, and irreversible agonist.

Radioligands are made up of the radioisotope, linker, and ligand. This structure allows the compound to identify and bind to the target tissue while retaining the ability to be tracked and imaged clinically. When a radioligand binds to its target, it alters the microenvironment of the receptor and surrounding tissue, partially due to the structure of the radioligand itself. Without both the high affinity ligand and the radioisotope, the efficiency of this process is lost.

== Use in drug delivery and release ==
Radioligands are administered through four main routes: intravenously, subcutaneous injection, intraperitoneally, and orally. While intravenous application is the most used route of injection, the route is dependent on the mechanism of action and overall aim of the binding. Before application of the ligand, clinicians will perform imaging, generally via Positron Emission Tomography (PET) or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) for baseline comparison after radioligand administration. Once the radioligand is administered, the radioligand will travel to the target tissue and selectively bind. The structure of the compound allows clinicians to easily identify the path traveled and the destination via repeated imaging and the signal put out by the radiotracer attached to the ligand.

Direct radiotherapy performed via ionizing radiation can cause tissue damage and hypoxia to tissues other than the target. While this effect is lessened in a target radiotracer therapy utilizing radioligands, there is still an impact on the surrounding tissue described as Radiation Induced Bystander Effect (RIBE). Surrounding cells altered by the radioligand and displaying RIBE can show signs of stress, chromosomal abnormalities, or even experience cell death. However, the type of radiation used, whether 𝜶, β, or both can have a dramatically different effect on both the target binding site and surrounding tissue. Changes in nearby tissue is not the only possible impact of ligand therapy, there may be immunologic responses from the target tissue that cause changes remotely. This has been deemed, &quot;abscopal effect&quot;. While this mechanism is not well understood, it explains the impact of other tissue, both benign and malignant, after targeted radiotherapy.

== Use in imaging ==
Imaging is a useful tool in visualization of the radioligand after injection, with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) being the most common types of imaging. PET scans are often utilized after radioligand administration because of the ease of use, image accuracy, and non-invasive nature. While PET and SPECT scans function similarly when imaging radioligands, the main difference lies in the type of radiation used, with PET Scans utilizing positrons and SPECT utilizing gamma rays. When comparing the two modalities, PET offers much better image quality and high diagnostic proficiency, however, the high cost limits the overall availability as well as the short half-lives of the positron-emitting isotopes. Alternatively, SPECT imaging is more dynamic because of the lower cost burden and longer half-lives of single-photon emitters. With advances in technology came hybrid imaging that can combine PET, SPECT, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Some hybrid imaging modalities include: SPECT/CT, PET/CT and PET/MRI. Although combined imaging presents both cost and availability barriers, the technology is an extremely useful diagnostic tool. Often, the patient does not have to be moved for both imaging types to be completed and the clinicians are provided with rich, multi-dimensional imaging.

== Binding assays ==
Measuring the extent and kinetics of radioligand binding is important in determining information about binding sites of radioligands, and subsequent affinity to potential drugs. Three different binding assays are typically used for radioligand binding; these are saturation, competition, and kinetic binding.

=== Saturation binding ===
Saturation binding measures the specific binding of a radioligand at varying concentrations while at equilibrium. Through this method, the number of receptors can be determined as well as affinity of the ligand to these receptors. Saturation binding experiments are often called &quot;Scatchard experiments&quot; as they can be graphed as a Scatchard plot.
=== Competition binding ===
Competitive binding experiments aim to determine the binding of a labeled radioligand at one specific concentration while subjected to various concentrations of a competitor, usually an unlabeled ligand. There are many purposes to competitive binding experiments, including being able to validate that the radioligand of interest will bind to the receptor with the expected affinity and potency even in the presence of a competitor. This experiment would also help determine if the radioligand will be able to recognize and bind to the correct receptor. Competitive binding experiments also serve to study the binding ability of a low-affinity drug, as it can be used as an unlabeled competitor. Finally, receptor number and affinity can also be determined through this experiment.

=== Kinetic binding ===
Kinetic binding experiments differ from saturation and competition experiments in that they are not done at equilibrium. Instead, they measure the course of binding of the radioligand during the experiment as well as the dissociation to determine calculation of the Kd, and rate constants of binding and dissociation. Kinetic binding experiments are also called dissociation binding experiments and can help evaluate the interaction of the radioligand and the targeted receptor.

== Alpha and beta particles ==
𝜶 and β particles are both used in the treatment of cancers, depending on the size and location of the particular tumor. Alpha particles contain overall higher energy and have a shorter path length, and have greater cytotoxic properties for this reason as compared to β particles. However, due to the shorter path length of these particles, the method of delivery needs to be extremely close to the location of the tumor. Currently, treatments using alpha-emitters exist which consist of alpha emitters attached to carrier molecules. Some examples of alpha-emitting radioligands include actinium-225, Ra-223-chloride, and Lead-212.36

β particles emit lower energy as compared to α-emitters, but they have the advantage of having longer path length. However, due to their lower energy, more β particles are required to cause damage to tumor cells as compared to α-emitters. Some examples of β-emitters include Lu-177, Y-90, and I-131.

== Oncological applications ==

=== Lutathera for neuroendocrine tumors ===
Lutathera is a peptide receptor radioligand/radionuclide therapy (approved by the FDA in 2018) specifically for patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) that have somatostatin hormone receptors (SSTR). The radioisotope is Lu-177 and the ligand is a SSTR on the surface of tumor cells. 

Lu-177 is produced by bombarding the stable isotope Yb-176 (which is found in monazite sand as well as the ores euxenite and xenotime) with neutrons. Yb-176 turns into Yb-177 which is unstable and has a half life of 1.9 hours so it quickly decays into the medical isotope Lu-177. For mass production, it is better to produce Yb-176 through fission reactors. This is the indirect production method and requires elaborate radiochemical separation, purification, and results in large amounts of radioactive waste. The direct method of producing Lu-177 is by performing neutron irradiation on Lu-176 to Lu-177. This is an inexpensive and effective method to produce Lu-177. In the United States, the main place that Lu-177 is produced is the University of Missouri Research Reactor.

Once produced, Lu-177 is stable for 72 hours if stored below room temperature. Freeze dried kits of Lutathera do show reduced effectiveness in radiation therapy but they maintain radiochemical purity. Lu-177 requires radiation shielding for handling. Lu-177 is stored and transported in a vial with lead/plexiglass shielding ready-to-use. Repeated production, timely delivery, and quick administration are important so that the therapy remains effective.

Once transported to the hospital or cancer treatment / oncology center, the patient is prepped, all necessary tests are done, and the patient requires two separate IV sites for infusion. One site for radioactive Lu-177 infusion and one site for amino acid infusion. Amino acid infusion is needed to reduce radiation toxicity to the organs - specifically the kidneys. The sites are separate to prevent radioactive contamination after therapy. The patient receives therapy by automated syringe, infusion pump, or gravity using long/short needles, tubing, and sodium chloride solution. Antiemetic (anti-nausea) medications or short/long acting octreotide (cancer growth control) can be used post-therapy for symptom management.

The most common side effects include decreased blood cell counts, increased liver enzymes, vomiting, nausea, increased blood glucose, and decreased blood potassium levels. Lutathera is not given to pregnant or breastfeeding individuals. The therapy shrinks tumors by an average of 30%, reduces disease progression by 72%, and delays the growth of tumors.

=== Pluvicto and Xofigo for prostate cancer ===
Pluvicto also uses Lu-177 as the radioisotope (which is a beta emitter that decays to Hf-177) but its ligand is a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted ligand as this radioligand therapy addresses metastatic prostate cancer. It was FDA approved in 2022. The difference between Lutathera and Pluvicto is shown in the chemical linkages in the images above. The production, transportation, and storage is the same as Lutathera. The therapy is administered intravenously through gravity, syringe, or a Peristaltic Infusion Pump. The major warnings include renal toxicity, infertility in males, and embryo/fetal harm. General side effects of this radioligand therapy include fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, anemia, decreased appetite, and constipation. Regular blood tests and imaging post-therapy are needed to see if the radioligand therapy is working and its side effects.

The benefits of Pluvicto include delaying tumor growth, extending life by about 20 months, and destroying tumor cells by damaging the DNA inside those cells.

Xofigo, a radioligand therapy that was FDA approved in 2013, uses Radium-223 dichloride as the radioisotope, but its ligand varies from Pluvicto. Pluvicto only attacks cancer cells expressing PSMA, but Xofigo attacks all bone metastases. Qualified patients are 30% less likely to die when treated by Xofigo than if treated by a placebo. Ra-223-chloride is an alpha-emitting bone targeting agent.

=== Iodine-131 tositumomab (Bexxar) and Zevalin (90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan) for non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma ===
Bexxar, a radioligand therapy using the radioisotope I-131+Tositumomab (a murine monoclonal antibody) and binding/targeting the ligand CD20 on human B-cells. CD20 is a membrane spanning protein found on B-cell lymphocytes that is a tumor marker as it is in higher concentration in cancer patients - specifically leukemias or lymphomas (like non-hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma).

I-131 is produced by nuclear fission or through neutron irradiation of Te-130 to convert it to Te-131 which decays to I-131 (produced in the University of Missouri Research Reactor). I-131 is stored in lead-shielding vials.

24 hours before and 14 days after administration, thyroid protective drugs and KI tablets are administered. I-131 and Tositumomab are administered separately over the course of 14 days intravenously by dosimetric and therapeutic doses. Side-effects include anemia, fever, rigors or chills, sweating, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, and nausea. There is a risk of radiation exposure to other individuals (women/children/fetus), anaphylaxis, neutropenia (low neutrophils), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet).

Zevalin, another radioligand therapy that targets non-Hodgkin lymphoma CD20 ligand but using Yttrium-90 as the radioisotope, was FDA approved in 2002.

== Requirements for administration ==
=== Patient eligibility ===

Each radioligand therapy requires significant patient testing and eligibility requirements before administration. Radioligand therapies for cancer treatment are not the first course of action and generally require the patient to have undergone other previous treatments and many diagnostic imagings (i.e. seeing if specific receptors/antigens exist) to determine the benefit vs. adverse effect of undergoing the radioligand therapy.

For example, the PSMA radioligand therapy (Pluvicto) requires the patient to have end-stage prostate cancer that has metastasized in other organs, the PSMA ligand (confirmed through diagnostic imaging), and gone through hormonal therapies and chemotherapies. For patient eligibility to get Lutathera radioligand therapy the patient must have disease progression despite receiving somatostatin analog therapy (octreotide or lanreotide), have a locally advanced, inoperable, or metastatic well-differentiated disease, and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.

=== Hospital requirements and staff training ===
Since the patient group receiving radioligand therapy is narrow, many health care providers are not equipped or eligible to administer radioligand therapy. PET imaging machines, a lead shielded area, and trained professionals must be available.

== Limitations ==
With radioligand therapy, there is always the risk of damage to non-cancerous surrounding tissues along with radioisotope toxicity which is always a challenge in determining how to administer and create the radioligand. Furthermore, the radioligand vial is only viable for a limited time and under specific conditions which challenges transport and storage along with feasible application to the patient. 

Another limitation is the lack of centers that have trained personnel and equipment for radioligand therapy. Furthermore, individual characteristics affect the exact radiosensitivity to the therapy (thus affecting dosimetry) and are hard to predict without radiobiological models52. 

== Future potential applications ==
In the future, radioligand therapy may expand to include more α-emitter based treatments. Currently, β radioligand therapies are more commonly used in oncology. Clinical trials of α-emitters are underway due to their higher potency and ability to induce double-strand DNA breaks. There are multiple Actinium-225 based PSMA studies that will be launched in 2024. If these prove successful, there is potential for further studies and clinical trials to be done using α-emitters. Additionally, there is potential for the future use of radioligand therapy in patients with malignant brain tumors. Finally, there have been recent developments in diagnostic tracers using radioligands, as well as with radioligand-based imaging techniques and in the field of theranostics.

<text>Most software systems have installation procedures that are needed before they can be used for their main purpose. Testing these procedures to achieve an installed software system that may be used is known as installation testing. These procedures may involve full or partial upgrades, and install/uninstall processes.

Installation testing may look for errors that occur in the installation process that affect the user&#x27;s perception and capability to use the installed software. There are many events that may affect the software installation and installation testing may test for proper installation whilst checking for a number of associated activities and events. Some examples include the following:
* A user must select a variety of options.
* Dependent files and libraries must be allocated, loaded or located.
* Valid hardware configurations must be present.
* Software systems may need connectivity to connect to other software systems.

Installation testing may also be considered as an activity-based approach to how to test something. For example, install the software in the various ways and on the various types of systems that it can be installed. Check which files are added or changed on disk. Does the installed software work? What happens when you uninstall?

This testing is typically performed in Operational acceptance testing, by a &quot;software testing engineer&quot; in conjunction with the configuration manager. Implementation testing is usually defined as testing which places a compiled version of code into the testing or pre-production environment, from which it may or may not progress into production. This generally takes place outside of the software development environment to limit code corruption from other future or past releases (or from the use of the wrong version of dependencies such as shared libraries) which may reside on the development environment.

The simplest installation approach is to run an install program, sometimes called &quot;package software&quot;. This package software typically uses a setup program which acts as a multi-configuration wrapper and which may allow the software to be installed on a variety of machine and/or operating environments. Every possible configuration should receive an appropriate level of testing so that it can be released to customers with confidence.

In distributed systems, particularly where software is to be released into an already live target environment (such as an operational website) installation (or software deployment as it is sometimes called) can involve database schema changes as well as the installation of new software. Deployment plans in such circumstances may include back-out procedures whose use is intended to roll the target environment back if the deployment is unsuccessful. Ideally, the deployment plan itself should be tested in an environment that is a replica of the live environment. A factor that can increase the organizational requirements of such an exercise is the need to synchronize the data in the test deployment environment with that in the live environment with minimum disruption to live operation. This type of implementation may include testing of the processes which take place during the installation or upgrade of a multi-tier application. This type of testing is commonly compared to a dress rehearsal or may even be called a &quot;dry run&quot;.

<text>Sevran () is a commune in the French department of Seine-Saint-Denis, northeastern suburbs of Paris, Île-de-France. It is located from the center of Paris.

==Geography==
Sevran is located northeast of the Boulevard Périphérique.

==Demographics==

===Immigration===
As of 2013 the origins of over half of its resident are from outside France. The largest ethnic backgrounds within the foreign origins are from sub-Saharan Africa, Algeria, and Morocco.

In 2013 &quot;The Economist&quot; stated that Sevran was one of the poorest areas of the Paris Metropolitan Area. As of 2013 36% of the residents are considered to be below the poverty line. The national average is 12%. About 75% of Sevran&#x27;s residents live in subsidized housing. The article also cites research that says &quot;somebody called Mohamed, Ali or Kamel is four times more likely to be unemployed than somebody named Philippe or Alain.&quot;

==Culture==
Sevran is home to an important music and dance school, the Espace François Mauriac, also known as the conservatoire de Sevran. Many important French and international musicians have taught there, including Claude Ballif, Allain Gaussin and Vincent Decleire. The famous French rapper Kaaris is also from Sevran, born to parents from Ivory Coast.

Allegations surfaced in 2016 accusing some cafés and bars of refusing to service women, when 3 activists participated in a television report by journalist Caroline Sinz of France 2. In the report, the following sentence could be heard about a local café: &quot;In this café, there is no diversity. We are in Sevran, we are not in Paris. You are in the 93 here! It&#x27;s different mentalities, it&#x27;s like back home.&quot; According to one of the activists, authorities turn a blind eye as the men support the mayor.

However, the Bondy Blog, an online media outlet focusing on working-class districts, published an article in March 2017 questioning the France 2 report, claiming to have noted the presence of women in this café on several occasions. A journalist from France 2 working for the investigative newsmagazine Complément d&#x27;enquête, who subsequently visited this café, also noted the presence of women and later abandoned the idea of filming a report there. The owner of the café later sued France 2 journalists David Pujadas and Caroline Sinz for racially-motivated libel.

==Heraldry==
==Transport==
Sevran is served by two stations on Paris RER line B: Sevran – Livry and Sevran – Beaudottes.

==Education==
Schools:
*15 public preschools (&quot;maternelles&quot;):
*16 public primary schools:
*1 private preschool: École maternelle Sainte-Agnès/École élémentaire Sainte-Agnès
*Junior high schools: Collège Evariste Galois, Collège Georges Brassens, Collège Paul Painlevé, and Collège La Pléïade

<doc id="517603" wikidata="Q332935" url="?curid=517603" title="Henry Fowler, 1st Viscount Wolverhampton">
<text>Henry Hartley Fowler, 1st Viscount Wolverhampton, (16 May 183025 February 1911) was a British solicitor and Liberal politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1880 until 1908 when he was raised to the peerage. A member of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, he was the first solicitor and the first Methodist to enter the Cabinet or to be raised to the peerage.

==Early life==
Fowler was born in Sunderland, the son of Rev. Joseph Fowler. He was educated at Woodhouse Grove School, Apperley Bridge, Bradford (1840–42) and later at St. Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School, Southwark.

He moved to Wolverhampton and was admitted as a solicitor in 1852. He served as a local councillor and was Mayor of Wolverhampton in 1866. He was chairman of Wolverhampton School Board in 1870, and was a Deputy Lieutenant for Staffordshire and JP for Wolverhampton.

==Political career==
At the 1880 general election Fowler was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough of Wolverhampton, a seat he held until the borough was divided under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. He then was then returned at the 1885 general election as the MP for Wolverhampton East. In the 1895 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours he was appointed GCSI. He remained in Parliament until he was ennobled in 1908. He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department from 1884 to 1885, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1886 and as President of the Local Government Board from 1892 to 1894 and under Lord Rosebery as Secretary of State for India from 1894 to 1895. In 1886, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

Fowler later held office under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster between 1905 and 1908. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Viscount Wolverhampton, of Wolverhampton in the County of Stafford, and served under Asquith as Lord President of the Council until 1910. He was widely thought of as a future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, but his ill health prevented this.

In his approach to policymaking, according to Neil Smith, Sir Henry Fowler (who became Viscount Wolverhampton in 1908) was supportive of reform legislation in the areas of pensions, education, and the Poor Law. According to his private secretary, however, he did not have &quot;the patience to suffer Radical and Labour members gladly.&quot;

He was an elected President of The Law Society 1901–02.

Lord Wolverhampton died on 25 February 1911, aged 80.

==Family==
Fowler married Ellen Thorneycroft, daughter of ironmaster and first Mayor of Wolverhampton, George Benjamin Thorneycroft, in 1857. They had a son and two daughters.

Their son Henry succeeded to the viscountcy. Their daughters were the authors the Hon. Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler and the Hon. Edith Henrietta Fowler (who wrote a biography of her father).

Viscountess Wolverhampton&#x27;s great nephew was Peter Thorneycroft.

<text>In restaurants, à la carte (; ; ) is the practice of ordering individual dishes from a menu in a restaurant, as opposed to &quot;table d&#x27;hôte&quot;, where a set menu is offered. It is an early 19th century loan from French meaning &quot;according to the menu&quot;.

The individual dishes to be ordered may include side dishes, or the side dishes may be offered separately, in which case, they are also considered &quot;à la carte&quot;.

==History==
The earliest examples of &quot;à la carte&quot; are from 1816 for the adjectival use (&quot;à la carte meal&quot;, for example) and from 1821 for the adverbial use (&quot;meals were served à la carte&quot;). These pre-date the use of the word menu, which came into English in the 1830s.

<text>Welthauptstadt Germania (), or World Capital Germania, was the projected renewal of the German capital Berlin during the Nazi period, as part of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s vision for the future of Nazi Germany after the planned victory in World War II. It was to be the capital of his planned &quot;Greater Germanic Reich&quot;. Albert Speer, the &quot;first architect of the Third Reich&quot;, produced many of the plans for the rebuilt city in his capacity as overseer of the project, only a small portion of which was realised between the years 1938 and 1943.

Some of the projects were completed, such as the creation of a great East–West city axis, which included broadening Charlottenburger Chaussee (today Straße des 17. Juni) and placing the Berlin Victory Column in the centre, far away from the Reichstag, where it originally stood. Other projects, however, such as the creation of the &quot;People&#x27;s Hall&quot; (&quot;Volkshalle&quot;), had to be shelved due to the beginning of war, although a great number of the old buildings in many of the planned construction areas were already demolished before the war. The Second World War and Nazi Germany&#x27;s defeat by the Allies ended development of the concept.

==Name==
Hitler conceived of rebuilding Berlin to be the capital of the new world he would be instrumental in creating, and provided the name for it, &#x27;Germania&#x27;. According to records of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;table talk&quot; of 8 June 1942, Hitler&#x27;s purpose in the renaming was to give a Greater Germanic world empire of the New Order a clear central point:

Hitler described his vision for the city several months earlier:

The official plan for rebuilding Berlin, with Albert Speer in charge, was called the &quot;Comprehensive Construction Plan for the Reich Capital&quot; (German: &quot;Gesamtbauplan für die Reichshauptstadt&quot;).

==Planning==

Doubts persisted at the time as to whether the marshy Berlin ground could have taken the immense weight of the proposed projects, leading to the construction of an &quot;exploration building&quot; (&quot;Schwerbelastungskörper&quot;, literal translation: heavy load-bearing body), which still exists near the site where the Arch of Triumph would have been built. The &quot;Schwerbelastungskörper&quot; is an extremely heavy block of concrete used by the architects to test how much weight the ground was able to carry. Instruments monitored how far the block sank into the ground. The &quot;Schwerbelastungskörper&quot; sank in the three years it was to be used for testing, compared to a maximum allowable settlement of . Using the evidence gathered by these gargantuan devices, it is unlikely the soil could have supported such structures without further preparation. The plan was to cover the &quot;Schwerbelastungskörper&quot; by building a bridge over it. The arch would have been nearby, but problems with the axis running through infrastructure would have made it difficult to establish any convenient location.

Speer was rebuked by Martin Bormann when he contacted Protestant and Catholic authorities regarding churches in the new building districts. According to Bormann, they were not to be included.

==Demolition==
The razing of old buildings to make way for the reconstruction of Berlin began in 1938 in various places around the city. This included the Alsen district, where the Great Hall would stand, and the Tiergarten district, where Speer planned to build the House for German Foreign Transport, and where the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Strasse would intersect with the great East-West Axis which was to be built. The East-West Axis was completed in time for Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration a year later, in 1939, when Speer ceremoniously presented it to Hitler with the words &quot;My &quot;Führer&quot;. I would like to report the completion of the east-west axis. May the work speak for itself.&quot;

==Construction==
Speer designed a new Chancellery, which included a vast hall designed to be twice as long as the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles. Hitler wanted him to build a third, even larger Chancellery, although it was never begun. The second Chancellery was destroyed by the Soviet Army in 1945.

Swedish Bohus granite was imported to be used as building material in Germania.

==Construction halted==

At the beginning of World War II, with the German invasion of Poland in 1939, construction was suspended, but resumed after the clear German victory. When France was defeated in 1940, Hitler visited Paris briefly with Speer and a few chosen others, the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s desire to &quot;give Berlin a new face&quot; was revitalised, and the work was redoubled at his command. At Speer&#x27;s instigation, Hitler signed a decree which read:

In the shortest possible time Berlin must be redeveloped and acquire the form that is its due through the greatness of our victory as the capital of a powerful new empire. In the completion of what is now &quot;the country&#x27;s most important architectural task&quot; I see the most significant contribution to our final victory. I expect that it will be completed by the year 1950. [emphasis in the original]

After serious setbacks in the German invasion of the Soviet Union, which Hitler had initially seen as another &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; (&quot;lightning war&quot;), construction on &quot;Germania&quot; was halted permanently in March 1943.

==Never constructed==
Almost none of the following buildings planned for Berlin were ever built:
===Avenue of Splendors===
Berlin was to be reorganised along a central boulevard known as the &quot;Prachtallee&quot; (&quot;Avenue/Boulevard of Splendor(s)&quot;). This would run south from a crossroads with the East-West Axis close to the Brandenburg Gate, following the course of the old Siegesallee through the Tiergarten before continuing down to an area just west of Tempelhof Airport. This new North-South Axis would have served as a parade ground, and have been closed off to traffic. Vehicles would have instead been diverted into an underground highway running directly underneath the parade route; sections of this highway&#x27;s tunnel structure were built, and still exist today. No work was ever begun above ground although Speer did relocate the Siegesallee to another part of the Tiergarten in 1938 in preparation for the avenue&#x27;s construction.

The plan also called for the building of two new large railway stations as the planned North-South Axis would have severed the tracks leading to the old Anhalter and Potsdamer stations, forcing their closure. These new stations would be built on the city&#x27;s main &quot;Hundekopf&quot; (dog&#x27;s head) geography S-Bahn ring with the &quot;Nordbahnhof&quot; in Wedding and the larger &quot;Südbahnhof&quot; in Tempelhof-Schöneberg at the southern end of the avenue. The Anhalter Bahnhof, no longer used as a railway station, would have been turned into a swimming pool.

===Großer Platz===
At the northern end of the avenue on the site of the &quot;Königsplatz&quot; (now the &quot;Platz der Republik&quot;) there was to be a large open forum known as &quot;Großer Platz&quot; (&quot;Grand Plaza&quot;) with an area of around . This square was to be surrounded by the grandest buildings of all, with the &quot;Führer&quot;&#x27;s palace on the west side on the site of the former Kroll Opera House, the 1894 Reichstag building on the east side, and the third Reich Chancellery and high command of the German Army on the south side (on either side of the square&#x27;s entrance from the &quot;Avenue of Splendours&quot;). On the north side of the plaza, straddling the River Spree, Speer planned to build the centrepiece of the new Berlin, an enormous domed building, the &quot;Volkshalle&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s hall&quot;), designed by Hitler himself. Had it been built, the &quot;Volkshalle&quot; would still be the largest enclosed space in the world today. Although war came before work could begin, all the necessary land was acquired and the engineering plans were worked out. The building would have been over high and in diameter, sixteen times larger than the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

===Triumphal Arch===
Towards the southern end of the avenue would be a triumphal arch based on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but again, much larger; it would be almost high, and the Arc de Triomphe (at the time the largest triumphal arch in existence) could have fit inside its opening, evidently with the intention of replacing the rather long history associated with this Arch and in particular the unique ceremonies, with reference to the history of France, connected with it. As a result of the occupation of Berlin by Soviet troops in 1945, a memorial was constructed with two thousand of the Soviet dead buried there in line with this proposed &#x27;Triumphal Arch&#x27;. It had been intended that inside this generously proportioned structure the names of the 1,800,000 German dead of the First World War should be carved.

<doc id="517620" wikidata="Q1287084" url="?curid=517620" title="Tom Seaver">
<text>George Thomas Seaver (November 17, 1944 – August 31, 2020), nicknamed &quot;Tom Terrific&quot; and &quot;the Franchise&quot;, was an American professional baseball pitcher who played 20 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the New York Mets, Cincinnati Reds, Chicago White Sox, and Boston Red Sox from to . Commonly described as the most iconic player in Mets history, Seaver played a significant role in their victory in the 1969 World Series over the Baltimore Orioles.

With the Mets, Seaver won the National League&#x27;s (NL) Rookie of the Year Award in 1967, and won three NL Cy Young Awards as the league&#x27;s best pitcher. He was a 12-time All-Star and ranks as the Mets&#x27; all-time leader in wins. During his MLB career, he compiled 311 wins, 3,640 strikeouts, 61 shutouts, a 2.86 earned run average, and he threw a no-hitter in 1978.

In 1992, Seaver was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, receiving the highest percentage of votes ever recorded at the time. Along with Mike Piazza, he is one of two players wearing a New York Mets hat on his plaque in the Hall of Fame. Seaver&#x27;s No. 41 was retired by the Mets in 1988, and New York City changed the address of Citi Field to 41 Seaver Way in 2019. Seaver is also a member of the New York Mets Hall of Fame and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Seaver was born in Fresno, California, to Betty Lee (née Cline) and Charles Henry Seaver. He attended Fresno High School and was a pitcher for the school&#x27;s baseball team. Seaver compensated for his lack of size and strength by developing great control on the mound. Despite being an All-City basketball player, he hoped to play baseball in college. He joined the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve on June 28, 1962. He served with AIRFMFPAC 29 Palms, California, through July 1963. After six months of active duty in the reserve, Seaver enrolled at Fresno City College. He remained a part-time member of the reserve until his eight-year commitment ended in 1970.

The University of Southern California (USC) recruited Seaver to play college baseball. Unsure as to whether Seaver was worthy of a scholarship, USC sent him to pitch in Alaska for the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks in the summer of 1964. After a stellar season, in which he pitched and won a game in the national tournament with a grand slam, USC head coach Rod Dedeaux awarded him a scholarship. As a sophomore in 1965, Seaver posted a 10–2 record for the Trojans, and he was selected in the tenth round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. When Seaver asked for $70,000, however, the Dodgers passed, only offering Seaver $2,000.

In 1966, Seaver signed a professional contract with the Atlanta Braves, who had selected him in the first round of the secondary January draft, 20th overall. However, the contract was voided by Baseball Commissioner William Eckert because USC had played two exhibition games that year, although Seaver had not participated. He then intended to finish the college season, but because he had signed a pro contract, the NCAA ruled him ineligible. After Seaver&#x27;s father complained to Eckert about the unfairness of the situation, and threatened a lawsuit, Eckert ruled that other teams could match the Braves&#x27; offer. The Mets were subsequently awarded his signing rights in a lottery drawing among the three teams (the Philadelphia Phillies and Cleveland Indians being the two others) that were willing to match the Braves&#x27; terms.

==Professional playing career==

===Minor leagues (1966)===
In 1966, Seaver was 12–12 with a 3.13 earned run average pitching in Class AAA with the Jacksonville Suns, the Mets&#x27; affiliate in the International League.

===New York Mets (1967–1977)===
Seaver made the Mets&#x27; roster in 1967, was named to the 1967 All-Star Game, and got the save by pitching a scoreless 15th inning. In his rookie season, Seaver was 16–13 for the last-place Mets, with 18 complete games, 170 strikeouts, and a 2.76 earned run average. Seaver was named the 1967 National League Rookie of the Year.

Seaver recalled later on that he approached Henry Aaron just before the All-Star Game, for his autograph. Seaver felt the need to introduce himself to Aaron, as he was certain that the veteran player would not know who he was. Aaron replied to Seaver, &quot;Kid, I know who you are, and before your career is over, I guarantee you everyone in this stadium will, too.&quot;

Seaver started for the Mets on Opening Day in 1968. He won 16 games again during that season, and recorded over 200 strikeouts for the first of nine consecutive seasons, but the Mets moved up only one spot in the standings, to ninth. In 1969, Seaver won a league-high 25 games, including nine consecutive complete-game victories. He won his first National League Cy Young Award. He also finished runner-up to Willie McCovey for the League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award.

In front of a crowd of over 50,000 at New York&#x27;s Shea Stadium on July 9, Seaver threw perfect innings against the division-leading Chicago Cubs. Rookie backup outfielder Jim Qualls broke up Seaver&#x27;s bid for a perfect game when he lined a clean single to left field.

In the inaugural National League Championship Series, Seaver outlasted Atlanta&#x27;s Phil Niekro in the first game for a 9–5 victory. Seaver was also the starter for Game One of the World Series, but lost a 4–1 decision to the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; Mike Cuellar. Seaver then pitched a 10-inning complete game for a 2–1 win in Game Four. The &quot;Miracle Mets&quot; won the series. At year&#x27;s end, Seaver was presented with the Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award.

On April 22, 1970, Seaver set a major league record by striking out the final ten batters of the game in a 2–1 victory over the San Diego Padres at Shea Stadium. Al Ferrara, who had homered in the second inning for the Padres&#x27; run, accounted for both the first and the final strikeout of the streak. In addition to his ten consecutive strikeouts, Seaver tied Steve Carlton&#x27;s major league record at the time, with 19 strikeouts in a nine-inning game. (The record was later eclipsed by 20-strikeout games by Kerry Wood, Randy Johnson, Max Scherzer, and twice by Roger Clemens.) By mid-August, Seaver&#x27;s record stood at 17–6 and he seemed well on his way to a second consecutive 20-victory season. But he only won one of his last ten starts, including four on short rest, to finish 18–12. Nonetheless, Seaver led the National League in both earned run average (2.82) and strikeouts (283).

In 1971, Seaver led the league in earned run average (1.76) and strikeouts (289 in 286 innings) while going 20–10. However, he finished second in the Cy Young balloting to Ferguson Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs, due to Jenkins&#x27; league-leading 24 wins, 325 innings pitched, and exceptional control numbers.

Seaver had four more 20-win seasons (20 in 1971, 21 in 1972, 22 in 1975, and 21 in 1977). He won two more Cy Young Awards (1973 and 1975, both with the Mets). Between 1970 and 1976, Seaver led the National League in strikeouts five times, while also finishing second in 1972 and third in 1974. Seaver also won three earned run average titles as a Met. Two famous quotes about Seaver are attributed to Reggie Jackson: &quot;Blind men come to the park just to hear him pitch.&quot; The second was in the 1973 World series, with the Mets up 3 games to 2, and poised to win their second championship. Seaver started the game, but did not have his &quot;arm&quot; that day, and lost the game. Jackson is reported to have said &quot;Seaver pitched with his heart that day.&quot; Seaver was known for his &quot;drop and drive&quot; overhand delivery, powered by his legs and trunk with his knee sinking to the ground.

===Midnight Massacre===
By , free agency had begun and contract negotiations between Mets&#x27; ownership and Seaver were not going well. Seaver wanted to renegotiate his contract to bring his salary in line with what other top pitchers were earning, but chairman of the board M. Donald Grant, who by that time had been given by Mets management to do what he wished, refused to budge. Longtime New York &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist Dick Young regularly wrote negative columns about Seaver&#x27;s &quot;greedy&quot; demands. Seaver attempted to resolve the impasse by going to team owner Lorinda de Roulet, who along with general manager Joe McDonald, had negotiated in principle a three-year contract extension by mid-June. Before the contract could be signed, Young wrote an unattributed story in the &quot;Daily News&quot; saying that Seaver was being goaded by his wife to ask for more money because she was envious of Nolan Ryan earning more money with the California Angels. Upon learning of the story, Seaver informed de Roulet and McDonald that he immediately wanted to be traded, believing that he could not co-exist with Grant.

In one of two trades that New York&#x27;s sports reporters dubbed &quot;the Midnight Massacre&quot; (the other involved struggling outfielder Dave Kingman), Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds at the trading deadline, June 15, 1977, for pitcher Pat Zachry, minor league outfielder Steve Henderson, infielder Doug Flynn, and minor league outfielder Dan Norman.

===Cincinnati Reds (1977–1982)===

Seaver went 14–3 with the Reds and won 21 games in 1977, including an emotional 5–1 victory over the Mets in his return to Shea Stadium. Seaver struck out 11 batters during the return game and also hit a double. He also received a lengthy ovation at the All-Star Game, held in New York&#x27;s Yankee Stadium. His departure from New York sparked sustained negative fan reaction, as the Mets became the league&#x27;s worst team, finishing in last place the next three seasons. Combined with the Yankees&#x27; resurgence in the market, attendance dipped during the 1978 New York Mets season and plunged during the 1979 New York Mets season to 9,740 per game. M. Donald Grant was fired after the 1978 season, and Joe McDonald was fired after the 1979 season following a sale of the team to publishing magnate Nelson Doubleday, Jr. In a sardonic nod to the general manager, Shea Stadium acquired the nickname &quot;Grant&#x27;s Tomb&quot;.

After having thrown five one-hitters for the Mets, including two games in which no-hit bids were broken up in the ninth inning, Seaver recorded a 4–0 no-hitter for the Reds in 1978 against the St. Louis Cardinals on June 16 at Riverfront Stadium. It was the only no-hitter of his professional career.

He led the Cincinnati pitching staff in 1979, when the Reds won the Western Division, and again in the strike-shortened 1981 season, when the Reds had the best record in the major leagues. In the latter season, Seaver, with his sterling 14–2 performance, was a close runner-up to Fernando Valenzuela for the 1981 Cy Young Award. (Seaver had finished third and fourth in two other previous years.) In 1981, during one of his two losses, Seaver recorded his 3,000th strikeout against Keith Hernandez of the St. Louis Cardinals. Then in 1982 he suffered through an injury-ridden campaign, finishing the season 5–13.

In six seasons with the Reds, Seaver was 75–46 with a 3.18 earned run average and 42 complete games in 158 starts.

===Return to Mets (1983)===
On December 16, 1982, Seaver was traded back to the Mets, for Charlie Puleo, Lloyd McClendon, and Jason Felice. On April 5, 1983, he tied Walter Johnson&#x27;s major league record of 14 Opening Day starts, shutting out the Philadelphia Phillies for six innings in a 2–0 Mets win. However, he posted a subpar 9–14 record that season.

The Mets exercised an option on Seaver&#x27;s contract worth $750,000 for the 1984 season. Overall, in 12 seasons with the Mets, Seaver was 198–124 with a 2.57 earned run average in 3,045 innings with 171 complete games, winning three Cy Young awards, the 1969 World Series and the 1967 NL Rookie of the Year Award.

===Chicago White Sox (1984–1986)===
On January 20, 1984, the Chicago White Sox claimed Seaver from the Mets in a free-agent compensation draft. The Mets, especially general manager Frank Cashen, incorrectly assumed that no one would pursue a high-salaried, 39-year-old starting pitcher and left him off the protected list.

Seaver pitched two and a half seasons in Chicago and recorded his last shutout on July 19, 1985, against the visiting Indians. In an anomaly, Seaver won two games on May 9, 1984; he pitched the 25th and final inning of a game suspended the day before, picking up the win in relief against the Milwaukee Brewers, before starting and winning the day&#x27;s regularly scheduled game, also facing the Brewers.

On August 4, 1985, Seaver recorded his 300th victory at Yankee Stadium over the Yankees, throwing a complete game 4–1 victory, with Mets announcer Lindsey Nelson in the booth.

Seaver started on Opening Day for the 16th and final time of his career in 1986. In three seasons with the White Sox, Seaver was 33–28 with a 3.67 earned run average and 17 complete games in 81 appearances.

===Boston Red Sox (1986)===
The White Sox traded Seaver to the Boston Red Sox for Steve Lyons in mid-season. Seaver&#x27;s 311th and final win came on August 18, 1986, against the Minnesota Twins.

A knee injury prevented Seaver from appearing against the Mets in the World Series with the Red Sox, but he received among the loudest ovations during player introductions prior to Game 1. Roger Clemens attributes the time he shared with Seaver as teammates in 1986 as instrumental in helping him make the transition from thrower to pitcher. The Red Sox did not offer Seaver a contract to his liking for the 1987 season. His 1986 salary was $1 million; the Red Sox offered $500,000, which Seaver declined. When no new contract agreement was reached, Seaver was granted free agency on November 12, 1986.

Seaver was 5–7 with a 3.80 earned run average in 16 starts with Boston in 1986.

In 1987, the Mets starting rotation was decimated by injury and they sought help from Seaver. Though no contract was signed, Seaver joined the club on June 6, and was hit hard in an exhibition game against the Triple-A Tidewater Tides on June 11. After similarly poor outings on June 16 and 20, he announced his retirement, saying that, &quot;there were no more pitches in this 42-year-old arm that were competitive. I&#x27;ve used them all up.&quot;

==Career overall==
Only Seaver and Walter Johnson have 300 wins, 3,000 strikeouts, and an earned run average under 3.00. Seaver&#x27;s 16 Opening-Day starts are an MLB record. At the time of his retirement, he was third on MLB&#x27;s all-time strikeout list (3,640), trailing only his former teammate Nolan Ryan and Steve Carlton; he currently ranks sixth all time. Seaver is tied with Ryan for the seventh-most shutouts in MLB history (61). His feat of striking out ten consecutive batters has only been matched once, by Aaron Nola in 2021. He also holds the record for consecutive 200-strikeout seasons with nine (1968–1976). Seaver&#x27;s 12 All-Star Game selections are the most of any starting pitcher in MLB history (Mariano Rivera, a closer, had 13 selections).

Seaver could also help himself at the plate. A decent hitter and proficient bunter, Seaver hit 12 home runs during his career, along with a relatively solid lifetime batting average, for a pitcher, of .154.

==Awards and honors==

The Mets retired Seaver&#x27;s uniform number 41 in 1988 in a Tom Seaver Day ceremony, making him the franchise&#x27;s first player to be so honored.

Seaver was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on January 7, 1992, with the then-highest percentage of votes with 98.84%. He was named on 425 out of 430 ballots. Three of the five ballots that had omitted Seaver were blank, cast by writers protesting the Hall&#x27;s decision to make Pete Rose ineligible for consideration. One ballot was sent by a writer who was recovering from open-heart surgery and failed to notice Seaver&#x27;s name. The fifth &quot;no&quot; vote was cast by a writer who said he never voted for any player in their first year of eligibility. Seaver is one of two players enshrined in the Hall of Fame with a Mets cap on his plaque, along with Mike Piazza. He was also inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame, the Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame, and the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.

In 1999, Seaver ranked 32nd on &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the only player to have spent a majority of his career with the Mets to make the list. In 2016, ESPN.com ranked Seaver 34th on its list of the greatest MLB players, while &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked him the 41st-greatest player in 2020.

On September 28, 2006, Seaver was chosen as the &quot;Hometown Hero&quot; for the Mets franchise by ESPN. Seaver made a return to Shea Stadium during the &quot;Shea Goodbye&quot; closing ceremony on September 28, 2008, where he threw out the final pitch in the history of the stadium to Piazza. Along with Piazza he opened the Mets&#x27; new home, Citi Field with the ceremonial first pitch on April 13, 2009.

The 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated to Seaver. He concluded the introduction of the starting lineup ceremonies by throwing out the ceremonial first pitch. Mets player David Wright participated. In 2019, the New York City renamed the street outside Citi Field from 126th Street to Seaver Way and changed the ballpark&#x27;s address to 41 Seaver Way, a salute of the number he wore throughout his career.

In 2017, Seaver was awarded the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award as the Hall of Fame recipient.

On April 15, 2022, at their home opener against the Arizona Diamondbacks, the Mets unveiled a 10-foot statue of Seaver in front of Citi Field.

==Broadcasting career==

Seaver&#x27;s television broadcasting experience dated back to his playing career, when he was invited to serve as a World Series analyst for ABC in and for NBC in , , and . Also while an active player, Seaver called the 1981 National League Division Series between Montreal and Philadelphia and that year&#x27;s National League Championship Series alongside Dick Enberg for NBC.

After retiring as a player, Seaver worked as a television color commentator for the Mets, the New York Yankees, and with Vin Scully in 1989 for NBC. Seaver replaced Joe Garagiola as NBC&#x27;s lead baseball color commentator, which led to him calling the 1989 All-Star Game and National League Championship Series. He worked as an analyst for Yankees&#x27; telecasts on WPIX from 1989 to 1993 and for Mets&#x27; telecasts on WPIX from 1999 to 2005, making him one of three sportscasters to be regular announcers for both teams; the others are Fran Healy and Tim McCarver.

==Personal life and death==
Seaver married Nancy Lynn McIntyre on June 9, 1966, in Jacksonville, Florida during Seaver&#x27;s Triple-A stint. They were the parents of two daughters, Sarah and Annie. They lived in Calistoga, California, where Seaver started his own 3.5-acre (1.4 ha) vineyard, Seaver Family Vineyards, on his 116-acre (47 ha) estate, in 2002. His first vintage was produced in 2005. He presented his two cabernets, &quot;Nancy&#x27;s Fancy&quot; and &quot;GTS,&quot; at an April 2010 wine-tasting event in SoHo, to positive reviews.

At the annual Hall of Fame induction, Seaver was part of a &quot;club&quot; which included Bob Gibson, Sandy Koufax, and Steve Carlton which annually brought a bottle of wine to share at a dinner held at The Otesaga Hotel.

Seaver was an opponent of the Vietnam War, and spoke out against it leading up to the 1969 World Series.

In 2013, it was reported that Seaver suffered from memory loss, not even remembering long-term acquaintances and experiencing symptoms of &quot;sleep disorder, nausea, and a general overall feeling of chemical imbalance&quot;. According to former teammate Bud Harrelson, Seaver was &quot;otherwise doing well&quot;. On March 7, 2019, Seaver&#x27;s family announced that he had dementia and was retiring from public life.

Seaver died in his sleep as a result of complications from Lewy body dementia and COVID-19 on August 31, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in California. He was 75.

<text>Sebastian Cabot (Italian and , ; , &quot;Gaboto&quot; or &quot;Cabot&quot;; 1474 – December 1557) was a Venetian explorer, likely born in the Venetian Republic and a Venetian citizen. He was the son of Venetian explorer John Cabot (Giovanni Caboto) and his Venetian wife Mattea.

After his father&#x27;s death, Cabot conducted his own voyages of discovery, seeking the Northwest Passage through North America on behalf of England. He later sailed for Spain, traveling to South America, where he explored the Rio de la Plata and established two new forts.

==Early life and education==
Accounts differ as to Sebastian Cabot&#x27;s place and date of birth. The historian James Williamson reviewed the evidence for various given dates in the 1480s and concluded that Sebastian was born not later than 1484, the son of John Cabot, a Venetian citizen credited with Genoese or Gaetan origins by birth, and of Mattea Caboto, also Venetian. Late in life, Cabot himself told Englishman Richard Eden that he was born in Bristol, and that he travelled back to Venice with his parents at four years of age, returning again with his father, so that he was thought to be Venetian. At another time, he told the Venetian ambassador at the court of Charles V, Gasparo Contarini (who noted it in his diary), that he was Venetian, educated in England. In 1515 Sebastian&#x27;s friend Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera wrote that Cabot was a Venetian by birth, but that his father (John Cabot) had taken him to England as a child. His father had lived in Venice from 1461, as he received citizenship (which required 15 years&#x27; residency) in 1476. The Caboto family moved to England in 1495 if not before.

Sebastian, his elder brother Ludovico and his younger brother Santo were included by name with their father in the royal letters patent from King Henry VII of March 1496 authorizing their father&#x27;s expeditions across the Atlantic. They are believed by some historians, including Rodney Skelton, still to have been minors since they were not mentioned in the 1498 patent their father also received. John Cabot sailed from Bristol on the small ship &quot;Matthew&quot; and reached the coast of a &quot;New Found Land&quot; on 24 June 1497. Historians have differed as to where Cabot landed, but two likely locations often suggested are Newfoundland and Nova Scotia.

===1494 Cabot scouting expedition===
According to &quot;Cartografía Marítima Hispana&quot;, Sebastian Cabot included a handwritten text in Latin on his famous map of North America (published in Antwerp, 1544) claiming to have discovered North America with his father in 1494, three years before his father&#x27;s voyage. Sancho Gutierrez repeated this text in Castilian on his 1551 map.

Placed next to the border of North America, the text reads:
This land was discovered by Johannes Caboto, venetian and Sebastian Caboto, his son, in the year of the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ MCCCCXCIV, 24th of June in the morning. They put to it the name &#x27;prima terra vista&#x27; and [...] This big island was named Saint John, as it was discovered on Saint John holiday. People there wander wearing animal furs. They use bow and arrow to fight, javelins and darts and wooden batons and slings. This is a very sterile land, there are a lot of white bears and very big deers, big as horses, and many other animals. As well there are infinite fish: plaices, salmons, very long soles, 1 yard long and many other varieties of fish. Most of them are called cod. And there are also black hawks, black as ravens, eagles, partridges and many other birds.

The year is stated as MCCCCXCIV (1494) in both hand-written versions. There cannot be confusion with the commonly accepted date for the Cabots&#x27; voyage, in 1497. Two suppositions can explain this. Sebastian Cabot and Sancho Gutiérrez may have changed the date in the middle of the sixteenth century. Intentional changes and inaccuracies were very common among geographers at the time, depending on the political interests of their sponsors. As Cabot was funded at the time of the map by Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, he may have been interested in showing that the first travel to North America was in 1494 and thus funded by Castilians or by Portuguese, and not by English or French. By the time Cabot was sponsored by Germany and Spain, both England and France had started claiming shares of the New World in competition with Spain and Portugal.

If Cabot and Gutiérrez stated the correct year, it would mean the Cabots sailed to North America on their own account, before proposing their services to England in 1496. No contemporaneous documentation for this has survived.

==Early career with England and Spain==
In 1504 Sebastian Cabot led an expedition from Bristol to the New World, using two ships: &quot;Jesus&quot; of Bristol and &quot;Gabriel&quot; of Bristol. These were mastered by Richard Savery and Philip Ketyner, respectively, and fitted out by Robert Thorne and Hugh Elyot. They brought back a certain amount of salted fish, which suggests the voyage was at least partly commercial and that other expeditions may also have included fishing. Cabot was granted an annuity of £10 on 3 April 1505 by Henry VII for services &quot;in and aboute the fyndynge of the new founde landes&quot;.
In 1508–09 Cabot led one of the first expeditions to find a North-West passage through North America. He is generally credited with gaining &quot;the high latitudes&quot;, where he told of encountering fields of icebergs and reported an open passage of water, but was forced to turn back. Some later descriptions suggest that he may have reached as far as the entrance of Hudson Bay. According to Peter Martyr&#x27;s 1516 account Sebastian then sailed south along the east coast of North America, passing the rich fisheries off the coast of Newfoundland, going on until he was &quot;almost in the latitude of Gibraltar&quot; and &quot;almost the longitude of Cuba&quot;. This would imply that he reached as far as the Chesapeake Bay, near what is now Washington, D.C. Returning home &quot;he found the King dead, and his son cared little for such an enterprise&quot;. This suggests Sebastian arrived back in England shortly after the death of Henry VII in April 1509 and the accession of Henry VIII, who did indeed show much less interest in the exploration of the New World than his father.

By 1512 Cabot was employed by Henry VIII as a cartographer, supplying the king with a map of Gascony and Guienne. In the same year he accompanied the Marquess of Dorset&#x27;s expedition to Spain, where he was made captain by Ferdinand V. Cabot believed that Spain was more interested in major exploration, but his hopes of getting Ferdinand&#x27;s support were lost with the king&#x27;s death. In the turmoil afterward, no plans would be made for new expeditions, and Cabot returned to England.

The scholar and translator/civil servant Richard Eden, who came to know Cabot towards the end of his life, ascribed to the explorer &#x27;the governance&#x27; of a voyage of c.1516 under English flag. This has been accepted and elaborated by a number of English writers, particularly of the turn of the nineteenth century. Rodney Skelton, author of Cabot&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Dictionary of Canadian Biography&quot;, connected Eden&#x27;s text to a known expedition of 1517 which indeed aborted, but is not known to have involved Cabot; while the historian Alwyn Ruddock transferred Eden&#x27;s story of the opposition to Cabot&#x27;s plans of Thomas Spert, future master of the king&#x27;s ship &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, to the explorer&#x27;s voyage of 1508–9.

Cabot&#x27;s effort&#x27;s in 1521 to bring together and lead an English discovery voyage to North America are well attested. He had the support of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey, and some offers of backing in money and ships from both Bristol and London merchants. But the Drapers Company expressed their distrust of Sebastian, and offered only limited funds. The response of other livery companies is unknown. The project was abandoned, and Cabot returned to Spain.

==Service to Spain==
Believing that King Ferdinand II of Aragon was giving more financial support to exploration than the English, Cabot moved to Spain from England in 1512. When King Ferdinand died in 1516 it ended a period of exploration and Cabot returned to England.

By 1522, he was once again working for Spain as a member of the Council of the Indies and holding the title of Pilot Major, where he supervised naval and navigator training, etc. Cabot secretly offered his services to Venice in communications with the Council of Ten. He promised to undertake to find the Northwest Passage to China for Venice if they would receive him.

Cabot was commissioned at the rank of captain general in Spain. On 4 March 1525, he was given command of a fleet that was to determine from astronomical observation the precise demarcation of the Treaty of Tordesillas, which defined the area of Spanish and Portuguese monopolies. He was also to convey settlers to the Molucca Islands in the Pacific, to strengthen Spanish claims in the spice islands. This voyage was officially noted as an expedition for the discovery of Tarshish, Ophir, Eastern Cathay, and Cipango (Japan). This expedition consisted of four ships with 250 men, and set sail from Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 3 April 1526.

By this time the survivors of Magellan&#x27;s expedition had completed their circumnavigation of the world, finding it larger than previously known. The voyage had increased pressure on Spain and Portugal to define their territories, as old boundaries seemed superseded by new data. Cabot was directed to cross the Pacific twice and he might have accomplished a second circumnavigation of the world. When Cabot landed with his expedition in Brazil, however, he heard of the rumours of the great wealth of the Incan king and the nearly-successful invasion of Aleixo Garcia. He abandoned his charge and explored the interior of the Río de la Plata along the northern border of present-day Argentina.

Cabot had already earned the disapproval of his crew by stranding the fleet in the doldrums and running the flagship aground off Santa Catarina Island. His decision regarding the Río de la Plata led to open resistance from Martin Méndez (his lieutenant general), Miguel de Rodas (pilot of the &quot;Capitana&quot;), and Francisco de Rojas (the captain of one of the other vessels). He dealt with the mutiny by marooning these men and other officers on Santa Catarina Island, where they are believed to have died.

Cabot sailed into the wide Río de la Plata and spent five months exploring the estuary. He established a fort called San Salvador at the confluence of the Uruguay and the Río San Salvador. This was the first Spanish settlement in modern-day Uruguay.

Leaving the two larger ships there, he sailed up the Paraná River in the brigantine and a galley constructed at Santa Catarina. His party constructed a small fort called Santo or Espíritu Santo at the confluence of the Paraná and the Río Carcarañá. This was the first Spanish settlement in present-day Argentina; the town of Gaboto was later constructed nearby and named in his honour. Losing 18 men to an ambush, Cabot returned to San Salvador, passing Diego García&#x27;s expedition as he went.

As a result of this encounter, Cabot sent one ship back to Spain. The &quot;Trinidad&quot; sailed on 8 July 1528 with his reports, accusations against the mutineers, and requests for further aid. In the spring of 1529, he returned upriver to Espíritu Santo, which he discovered had been overwhelmed and burnt by the Indians during his absence. He recovered the cannon and returned to San Salvador.

At a council on 6 August 1529, he decided to return to Spain. Cabot sailed with García to São Vicente. Purchasing 50 slaves there, he traveled along the coast of Brazil before heading across the Atlantic, reaching Seville on 22 July 1530, with one ship and 24 men.

He was arraigned on charges from the Crown, by Rojas, and by the families of Rodas and Méndez. He was condemned by the Council of the Indies on charges of disobedience, misadministration, and causing the death of officers under his command. He was sentenced to heavy fines and a two-year banishment to Oran in North Africa.

During these proceedings, however, the Emperor of Spain had been absent in Germany. Upon his return, Cabot presented him with descriptions of the region. Although no pardon is recorded and the fines were still paid, it is known that Cabot never went into exile. He retained the post of pilot-major of Spain until 1547. Without losing either title or pension, he left Spain and returned to England.

==Later years==
In the year 1553, Cabot discussed a voyage to China and re-joining the service of Charles V with Jean Scheyfve, the king&#x27;s ambassador in England. In the meantime Cabot had reopened negotiations with Venice, but he reached no agreement with that republic. After this he acted as an advisor for &quot;English ventures for discovery of the Northwest Passage. He became governor of the Muscovy Company in 1553 and, along with John Dee, helped it prepare for an expedition led by Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor. He was made life-governor of the &quot;Company of Merchant Adventurers&quot;, and equipped the 1557 expedition of Steven Borough. By February 1557, he was replaced as governor of the Muscovy Company. He was recorded as receiving a quarterly pension, which he was first paid in person. Someone picked up for him in June and September 1557, and no one was paid in December, suggesting that he had died by then.

==Marriages and family==
Cabot married Joanna (later recorded as Juana in Spanish documents.) They had children before 1512, the year he entered Spanish service. That year, he returned to London to bring his wife and family to Seville. By 14 September 1514, his wife was dead. Among his children was a daughter Elizabeth. An unnamed daughter was recorded as dying in 1533.

=== Catalina de Medrano ===
In Spain Sebastian Cabot married again, in 1523, to Catalina de Medrano, widow of the conquistador Pedro Barba. It is not known if the marriage between Sebastian and Catalina produced offspring. But since the Spanish wills of both Catalina (1547) and Sebastian (1548) name nieces of Catalina as their heirs, it is unlikely that by the time of Catalina&#x27;s death, the pair had children surviving from their marriage. Catalina died on 2 Sep 1547.

Various official documents, from 25 Aug. 1525, name Cabot&#x27;s wife as Catalina de Medrano. Witnesses in the lawsuits following Cabot&#x27;s return to Spain in 1530 testified that his wife was a domineering woman who handled his affairs. Catalina&#x27;s daughter Catalina Barba y Medrano died in 1533. The reference to &quot;sons&quot; of Catalina de Medrano, found in one document only, of 1525, may be merely an official formalism. On June 22, 1523, Sebastian Cabot, acting as Catalina Barba y Medrano&#x27;s guardian, appointed Fernando de Jerez as her attorney and arranged her property schedule. While it’s unclear why Cabot became her guardian, it was likely appointed by her father, Pedro Barba, before his departure for Havana. Barba, a relative of Amerigo Vespucci, may have chosen Cabot due to respect for navigators. Cabot’s debt to Maria Cerezo escalated tensions over Barba’s estate, leading Cerezo to question Catalina Barba y Medrano’s legitimacy.

In November 1523, a Real Cédula confirmed Catalina Barba y Medrano’s legitimacy and marriage, ending legal disputes. Cabot&#x27;s financial struggles included unpaid pensions to Cerezo, partially resolved through deductions from his salary. Despite financial challenges, Catalina de Medrano&#x27;s dowry (267 ducats) and business expertise supported Cabot, who granted her power of attorney in June 1524—a rare move for the time. Catalina de Medrano managed family finances, settling debts and handling business affairs, though she faced challenges like gender-related reluctance in transactions. Her family had long-standing connections with Spanish nobility, supplying fine cloth and goods to the royal court in the late 15th century. Catalina de Medrano exemplified the resilience of Seville’s women, who often managed families and businesses during uncertain times. Her second marriage to Cabot, based on trust and respect, secured her daughter’s inheritance and maintained her vital role in navigating the complex social and financial challenges of the period.

==Reputation==
From the later sixteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century, historians believed that Sebastian Cabot, rather than his father John, led the famous Bristol expeditions of the later 1490s, which resulted in the European discovery, or rediscovery after the Vikings, of North America. This error seems to have been attributed to Sebastian&#x27;s accounts in his old age. The result was that the influential geographical writer Richard Hakluyt represented his father John Cabot as a figurehead for the expeditions and suggested that Sebastian actually led them. When new archival finds in the nineteenth century demonstrated that this was not the case, Sebastian was denigrated, disparaged by Henry Harrisse, in particular, as a man who willfully appropriated his father&#x27;s achievements and represented them as his own. Because of this, Sebastian received much less attention in the twentieth century. But other documentary finds, as summarized above, have demonstrated that he did lead some exploratory voyages from Bristol in the first decade of the sixteenth century.

A. C. H. Smith wrote a biographical novel about him, &quot;Sebastian The Navigator&quot; (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1985).

<text>An image viewer or image browser is a computer program that can display stored graphical images; it can often handle various graphics file formats. Such software usually renders the image according to properties of the display such as color depth, display resolution, and color profile.

Although one may use a full-featured raster graphics editor (such as Photoshop or GIMP) as an image viewer, these have many editing functionalities which are not needed for just viewing images, and therefore usually start rather slowly. Also, most viewers have functionalities that editors usually lack, such as stepping through all the images in a directory (possibly as a slideshow).

Image viewers give maximal flexibility to the user by providing a direct view of the directory structure available on a hard disk. Most image viewers do not provide any kind of automatic organization of pictures and therefore the burden remains on the user to create and maintain their folder structure (using tag- or folder-based methods). However, some image viewers also have features for organizing images, especially an image database, and hence can also be used as image organizer.

Some image viewers, such as Windows Photo Viewer that come with Windows operating systems, change a JPEG image if it is rotated, resulting in loss of image quality; others offer lossless rotation.

==Features==
Typical features of image viewers are:
* basic viewing operations such as zooming and rotation
* fullscreen display
* slideshow
* thumbnail display
* printing
* screen capture
* photo editor (if installed)
* The ability to jump to a random file in the folder to facilitate searching.

Advanced features are:
* decode next image in advance and keep previous decoded image in memory for fast image changes
* display (and edit) metadata such as XMP, IPTC Information Interchange Model and Exif
* batch conversion (image format, image dimensions, etc.) and renaming
* create contact sheets
* create HTML thumbnail pages
* different transition effects for slideshows

<text>The barramundi (Lates calcarifer), Asian sea bass, or giant sea perch (also known as dangri, apahap or siakap) is a species of catadromous fish in the family Latidae of the order Carangiformes. The species is widely distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, spanning the waters of the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Oceania.

==Etymology==

Barramundi is a loanword from an Australian Aboriginal language of the Rockhampton area in Queensland meaning &quot;large-scaled river fish&quot;. Originally, the name barramundi referred to &quot;Scleropages leichardti&quot; and &quot;Scleropages jardinii&quot;.

However, the name was appropriated for marketing reasons during the 1980s, a decision that significantly raised the profile of this fish. &quot;L. calcarifer&quot; is broadly referred to as Asian seabass by the international scientific community, but is sometimes known as Australian seabass or giant sea perch.

==Description==
This species has an elongated body form with a large, slightly oblique mouth and an upper jaw extending behind the eye. The lower edge of the preoperculum is serrated with a strong spine at its angle; the operculum has a small spine and a serrated flap above the origin of the lateral line. Its scales are ctenoid.
In cross section, the fish is compressed and the dorsal head profile clearly concave. The single dorsal and ventral fins have spines and soft rays; the paired pectoral and pelvic fins have soft rays only; and the caudal fin has soft rays and is truncated and rounded.
Barramundi are salt and freshwater sportfish, targeted by many. They have large, silver scales, which may become darker or lighter, depending on their environments. Their bodies can reach up to long, though evidence of them being caught at this size is scarce. The maximum weight is about . The average length is about . Its genome size is about 700 Mb, which was sequenced and published in Animal Genetics (2015, in press) by James Cook University.

Barramundi are demersal, inhabiting coastal waters, estuaries, lagoons, and rivers; they are found in clear to turbid water, usually within a temperature range of 26−30 °C. This species does not undertake extensive migrations within or between river systems, which has presumably influenced establishment of genetically distinct stocks in Northern Australia.

==Life cycle==

The barramundi feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, and smaller fish (including its own species); juveniles feed on zooplankton.
The barramundi is euryhaline, but stenothermal. It inhabits rivers and descends to estuaries and tidal flats to spawn. In areas remote from fresh water, purely marine populations may become established.

At the start of the monsoon, males migrate downriver to meet females, which lay very large numbers of eggs (several millions each). The adults do not guard the eggs or the fry, which require brackish water to develop. 
The species is sequentially hermaphroditic, with most individuals maturing as males and becoming female after at least one spawning season; most of the larger specimens are therefore female. Fish held in captivity sometimes demonstrate features atypical of fish in the wild; they change sex at a smaller size, exhibit a higher proportion of protogyny and some males do not undergo sexual inversion.

==Recreational fishing==
Prized by anglers and sport-fishing enthusiasts for their good fighting ability, barramundi are reputed to be good at avoiding fixed nets and are best caught on lines and with fishing lures. In Australia, the barramundi is used to stock freshwater reservoirs for recreational fishing.

These &quot;impoundment barramundi&quot;, as they are known by anglers, have grown in popularity as a &quot;catch and release&quot; fish. Popular stocked barramundi impoundments include Lake Tinaroo near Cairns in the Atherton Tablelands, Lake Proserpine west of Proserpine, Queensland, Teemburra Dam near Mackay, Lake Moondarra near Mount Isa, Lake Awoonga near Gladstone, and Lake Monduran south of Lake Awoonga.

==Commercial fishing and aquaculture==

The fish is of commercial importance; it is fished internationally and raised in aquaculture in Australia, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, Israel, Thailand, the United States, Poland, and the United Kingdom.

The Australian barramundi industry is relatively established, with an annual production of more than 9,000 tons. In the broader Southeast Asian region, production is estimated to exceed 30,000 tons. A joint venture between a Sri Lankan company, Oceanpick (Pvt) Ltd, and a Scottish fish farm has been ocean farming barramundi sustainably in Sri Lanka since 2012, using the deep waters of Trincomalee Bay, on the island&#x27;s northeast coast. A Singapore investment firm has invested in an upcoming barramundi fish farm in Brunei.

Barramundi under culture commonly grow from a hatchery juvenile, between 50 and 100 mm in length, to a table size of 400–600 g within 12 months and to 3.0 kg within 18–24 months.

==Diseases==
Though Asian sea bass are a hardy fish, they are vulnerable to bacterial infections like photobacteriosis.

==Aquarium use==
These fish are not generally kept in home aquaria. They may be confused with an Australian reef fish commonly called the humpback grouper (&quot;Cromileptes altivelis&quot;), also known as barramundi cod, panther grouper, or polkadot grouper, juveniles of which are frequently offered for sale in the ornamental fish trade. However, they rapidly outgrow most home aquariums.

==As food==

Barramundi have a mild flavour and a white, flaky flesh, with varying amount of body fat. 

Barramundi are a favourite food of the region&#x27;s apex predator, saltwater crocodiles, which have been known to take them from unwary fishermen.

===Australian cuisine===

In Australia, such is the demand for the fish that a substantial amount of barramundi consumed there is actually imported. This has placed economic pressure on Australian producers, both fishers and farmers, whose costs are greater due to remoteness of many of the farming and fishing sites, as well as stringent environmental and food safety standards placed on them by government. While country-of-origin labelling has given consumers greater certainty over the origins of their barramundi at the retail level, there have been changes to align food labelling standards to food service outlets with regard to barramundi. 

===Bengali cuisine===
Barramundi, known as &quot;Deshi Bhetki&quot; (Bengali : দেশি ভেটকি) are also called &quot;Koral&quot; (Bengali: কোরাল) is a popular fish among Bengali people, mainly served in festivities such as marriages and other important social events. It is cooked as&quot; bhetki machher paturi&quot;, &quot;bhetki machher kalia&quot;, or coated in &quot;crumbled biscuit&quot; (similar to golden bread crumbs) and pan fried.
It is very popular among people who are usually sceptical about eating fish with a lot of bones. &quot;Bhetki&quot; fillets have no bones in them. In Bengali cuisine, therefore, fried&quot; bhetki&quot; fillets are popular and considered to be of good quality. The dish is commonly called &quot;fish fry&quot;.

===Goan cuisine===
Locally caught &quot;chonak&quot; (barramundi) is a favourite food, prepared with either &quot;recheado&quot; (a Goan red masala) or coated with &quot;rava&quot; (&quot;sooji&quot;, semolina) and pan fried. The fish is generally filleted on the diagonal. It is eaten as a snack or as an accompaniment to drinks or the main course. It is one of the more expensive fish available.
===Thai cuisine===
Barramundi from local fish farms are known as &quot;pla kapong&quot; () in Thailand. Since its introduction, it has become one of the most popular fish in Thai cuisine. It is often eaten steamed with lime and garlic, as well as deep-fried or stir-fried with lemongrass, among a variety of many other ways. &quot;Pla kapong&quot; can be seen in aquaria in many restaurants in Thailand, where sometimes this fish is wrongly labelled as &quot;snapper&quot; or &quot;sea bass&quot; on menus. Traditionally, Lutjanidae snappers were known as &quot;pla kapong&quot; before the introduction of barramundi in Thai aquaculture, but presently, snapper is rarely served in restaurants in the main cities and in interior Thailand. 

===United States===
In the US, barramundi is growing in popularity. Monterey Bay Aquarium has deemed US and Vietnam-raised barramundi as &quot;Best Choice&quot; under the Seafood Watch sustainability program.

<text>Camboinhas is one of the 48 neighborhoods into which the city of Niterói, in Brazil, is divided.

The name originated in a marine accident in the 1950s. In that decade, a ship called &quot;Camboinhas&quot; grounded on the beach. A Brazilian Navy corvette named &quot;Angostura&quot; was sent to save the ship, but grounded during her attempts to tow &quot;Camboinhas&quot; out of the beach. The Navy then abandoned their attempts to salvage the &quot;Camboinhas&quot; and concentrated all efforts on saving the &quot;Angostura&quot;, which they eventually succeeded in doing. Today, the remains of the hull of the &quot;Camboinhas&quot; can be seen on the beach, during low tide.

The neighborhood has shores on both the Itaipu Lagoon and the Atlantic Ocean and was inhabited primarily by fishermen until 1978, when a company named &quot;Veplan&quot; started lotting the land for the real estate market. Between the years of 1980 and 1991, the place experienced a population growth rate of 14.84% per year, leading the city&#x27;s statistics in that category. As a result, in 1991 it had a population of 926, which equals 0.21% of the total population of the municipality.

On the Atlantic shore, the place is marked by typical vegetation of the region, with sand dunes and restinga vegetation.

In terms of occupation, the area is dominated by middle and upper-class family residences. 95.51% of the houses have plumbing.

Tourism: the views of Rio de Janeiro from this beach are some of the most beautiful around. It&#x27;s a wonderful place to spend the day. It&#x27;s about a 1 hr drive from Rio. The beach is not very crowded at all during the week, it&#x27;s very swimmable and walkable, there are kiosks/little restaurants right on the beach serving snacks, full meals (great seafood) and cold drinks. It&#x27;s worth staying for the gorgeous sunsets.

<doc id="517668" wikidata="Q4036780" url="?curid=517668" title="Currah">
<text>Currah was a British computer peripheral manufacturer, famous mainly for the speech synthesis ROM cartridges it designed for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, and other 8-bit home computers of the 1980s.

==Currah μSource for the ZX Spectrum==
The Currah μSource, commonly referred to as the &quot;Microsource&quot;, from Quadhouse is a self-contained ROM cartridge with a full-function-two-pass macro assembler, Forth and a debugger, all of which can interact with BASIC. It is also compatible with Interface 1.

==Currah μSpeech for the ZX Spectrum==
The Currah μSpeech, commonly referred to as the &quot;Microspeech&quot;, plugged into the expansion port on the back of the ZX Spectrum. Additional leads were provided to feed the sound and UHF signal from the computer into the unit. The TV aerial lead plugged into the unit and speech sounds were added into the UHF signal generated by computer.

By default, the unit &quot;spoke&quot; every key-press the user made, even the direction keys which came out as &quot;CURSOR&quot;. This could be controlled by a reserved variable codice_1. Typing
 LET KEYS=0
would turn this feature off.

===Programming speech===
Specific words and phrases could be spoken by assigning a value to the reserved string variable codice_2. This was interpreted letter-by-letter unless brackets were used to denote other allophones. A simple example would be &quot;(dth)is&quot;, (dth) representing the voiced dental fricative /ð/. Sixty-three allophones were provided. Rudimentary pitch modulation could be achieved by altering the case of the letters—upper case letters being pronounced at a slightly higher pitch.

A more complex example:
 5 REM OKAY WISEGUY THIS IS IT
 10 LET a$=&quot; (oo)K (AA)&quot;
 20 LET b$=&quot;w(ii)z (ggg) (ii),&quot;
 30 LET c$=&quot; (dth)is iz it&quot;
 40 LET S$=a$+b$+c$

===Technical details===
The unit contained a ULA which worked on a WRITE command from the microprocessor, a ROM containing the keyword speech patterns, and an SP0256-AL2 speech processor. It also contained a clock for clear speech and an audio modulator to transfer the sound to the TV lead. A small adjustment screw was provided, to allow fine tuning of the audio output.

The unit allocated itself the top 256 bytes of memory at switch-on and moved down the USR graphics and RAMTOP. This made it incompatible with some programs, particularly games, which use that space for machine code.

For cost reasons, the unit did not provide for daisy-chaining of further devices on the computer&#x27;s expansion port. Many joystick interface manufacturers took the same approach, meaning that you could not have a joystick and the MicroSpeech unit plugged in at the same time.

&quot;Booty&quot; (Firebird Software Ltd) detected the presence of a MicroSpeech unit and presented the user with a completely different game to that which would be played if the MicroSpeech unit was not present.

==History==
Currah was acquired by DK&#x27;Tronics in 1985. DK&#x27;Tronics continued to manufacture the MicroSpeech unit, and many of their software titles (such as &quot;Maziacs&quot; and &quot;Zig Zag&quot;) supported it.

<doc id="517675" wikidata="Q381296" url="?curid=517675" title="Faiz Ahmad Faiz">
<text>Faiz Ahmad Faiz (13 February 1911 – 20 November 1984) was a Pakistani poet and author of Punjabi and Urdu literature. Faiz was one of the most celebrated, popular, and influential Urdu writers of his time, and his works and ideas remain widely influential in Pakistan and beyond. Outside of literature, he has been described as &quot;a man of wide experience&quot;, having worked as a teacher, military officer, journalist, trade unionist, and broadcaster.

Born in Faiz Nagar, British Punjab (now in Narowal District, Pakistan), Faiz studied at Government College and Oriental College in Lahore and went on to serve in the British Indian Army. After the Partition of India, Faiz served as editor-in-chief of two major newspapers — the English language daily &quot;Pakistan Times&quot; and the Urdu daily &quot;Imroze.&quot; He was also a leading member of the Communist Party before his arrest and imprisonment in 1951 for his alleged part in a conspiracy to overthrow the Liaquat administration and replace it with a left-wing, pro-Soviet government.

Faiz was released after four years in prison and spent time in Moscow and London, becoming a notable member of the Progressive Writers&#x27; Movement. After the downfall of military dictator Ayub Khan&#x27;s government, and the Independence of Bangladesh, he worked as an aide to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, but exiled himself to Beirut after Bhutto&#x27;s execution at the hands of another military dictator Zia ul-Haq.

Faiz was a well-known Marxist and is said to have been &quot;a progressive who remained faithful to Marxism.&quot; Critics have noted that Faiz took the tenets of Marxism where Muhammad Iqbal had left it, and relayed it to a younger generation of Muslims who were considered more open to change, more receptive to egalitarianism, and had a greater concern for the poor. Literary critic Fateh Muhammad Malik argues that while initially Faiz was more of a secular Marxist he eventually subscribed to Islamic socialism as his life progressed, as his poems getting more religious in tone over the years demonstrate, even suggesting that Faiz ultimately aimed for an Islamic revolution, having endorsed the 1979 Iranian revolution.

Faiz was the first Asian poet to be awarded the Lenin Peace Prize (1962) by the Soviet Union and was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in literature. He was posthumously honoured when the Pakistan Government conferred upon him the nation&#x27;s highest civil award — the &quot;Nishan-e-Imtiaz —&quot; in 1990.

==Early life==

=== Family background ===
Faiz Ahmad Faiz was born on 13 February, 1911 in Kala Qader, in the Sialkot District of the Punjab Province of British India (present-day Faiz Nagar, in the Narowal District of Punjab, Pakistan) into a Punjabi family belonging to the Tataley clan of Muslim Jats.

Faiz hailed from an academic family that was well known in literary circles. His home was often the scene of a gathering of local poets and writers who met to promote the literacy movement in his native province. Faiz&#x27;s father, Sultan Muhammad Khan, was a prominent barrister who worked for the British Government and an autodidact who wrote and published the biography of Amir Abdur Rahman, an Emir of Imperial Afghanistan. Khan was the son of a peasant whose ancestors migrated from Afghanistan to British India. Khan worked as a shepherd as a child but was ultimately able to study law at Cambridge University.

===Education===
Following the Muslim tradition, Faiz&#x27;s family directed him to study Islamic studies at the local mosque to be oriented to the basics of religious studies by the Ahl-i Hadith scholar Muhammad Ibrahim Mir Sialkoti. Following the Muslim tradition, he learned Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and the Quran. Faiz was also a Pakistan nationalist, and often said, &quot;purify your hearts, so you can save the country...&quot; His father later pulled him from Islamic school because Faiz, who went to a madrasa for a few days found that the impoverished children there, were not comfortable having him around and ridiculed him. Faiz came to the madrasa in neat clothes, in a horse-drawn carriage, while the students of the school were from very poor backgrounds and used to sit on the floor on straw mats. Faiz&#x27;s close friend, Dr. Ayub Mirza, recalls that Faiz came home and told his father he was not going to attend the madrasa anymore. His father then registered him at the Scotch Mission School which was managed and run by a local British family.

Faiz attended Murray College at Sialkot for intermediate studies (11th and 12th grade). In 1926, Faiz enrolled in Department of Languages and Fine Arts of the Government College, Lahore. While there, he was greatly influenced by Shams-ul-Ulema, Professor Mir Hassan who taught Arabic and Professor Pitras Bukhari . Professor Hasan had also taught Dr. Muhammad Iqbal, a philosopher, poet, and politician of South Asia. In 1926, Faiz attained his BA with Honors in Arabic, under the supervision of Professor Mir Hassan. In 1930, Faiz joined the post-graduate program of the Government College, obtaining an MA in English literature in 1932, and wrote his master&#x27;s thesis on the poetry of Robert Browning. The same year, Faiz completed a first-class degree at Punjab University&#x27;s Oriental College. It was during his college years that he met M. N. Roy and Muzaffar Ahmed who influenced him to become a member of the Communist Party. In addition to Urdu, English, and Arabic, Faiz was also fluent in French and Persian.

==Career==

===Academia===

In 1935 Faiz joined the faculty of Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, serving as a lecturer in English and British literature. Later in 1937, Faiz moved to Lahore to reunite with his family after accepting the professorship at the Hailey College of Commerce, initially teaching introductory courses on economics and commerce. In 1936, Faiz joined a literary movement, (PWM) and was appointed its first secretary by his fellow Marxist Sajjad Zaheer. In East and West-Pakistan, the movement gained considerable support in civil society. In 1938, he became editor-in-chief of the monthly Urdu magazine &quot;&quot;Adab-e-Latif&quot; (lit. Belles Letters) until 1946. In 1941, Faiz published his first literary book &quot;Naqsh-e-Faryadi&quot; (lit. Imprints) and joined the Pakistan Arts Council (PAC) in 1947.

Faiz was a good friend of Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko who once said &quot;In Faiz&#x27;s autobiography... is his poetry, the rest is just a footnote&quot;. During his lifetime, Faiz published eight books and received accolades for his works. Faiz was a humanist, a lyrical poet, whose popularity reached neighbouring India and Soviet Union. Indian biographer Amaresh Datta, compared Faiz as &quot;equal esteem in both East and West&quot;. Throughout his life, his revolutionary poetry addressed the tyranny of military dictatorships, tyranny, and oppression. Faiz himself never compromised on his principles despite being threatened by the right-wing parties in Pakistan.

Faiz&#x27;s writings are comparatively new verse form in Urdu poetry based on Western models. Faiz was influenced by the works of Allama Iqbal and Mirza Ghalib, assimilating modern Urdu with classical. Faiz used more and more demands for the development of socialism in the country, finding socialism the only solution of country&#x27;s problems. During his life, Faiz was concerned with more broader socialists ideas, using Urdu poetry for the cause and expansion of socialism in the country. Urdu poetry and &quot;ghazals&quot; influenced Faiz to continue his political themes as non-violent and peaceful, opposing the far right politics in Pakistan. Faiz consistently faced political persecution for his revolutionary views and ideologies and was especially targeted by the religious and conservative press due to his lifelong advocacy for the rights of women and workers.

===Military service===
On 11 May 1942, Faiz was commissioned in the British Indian Army as a second lieutenant in the 18th Royal Garhwal Rifles. Initially assigned as a public relations officer in the General Staff Branch, Faiz received rapid promotions in succession to acting captain on 18 July 1942, war-substantive lieutenant and temporary captain on 1 November 1942, acting major on 19 November 1943 and to temporary major and war-substantive captain on 19 February 1944. On 30 December 1944, he received a desk assignment as an assistant director of public relations on the staff of the North-Western Army, with the local rank of lieutenant-colonel. For his service, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, Military Division (MBE) in the 1945 New Year Honours list. Faiz served with a unit led by Akbar Khan, a left-wing officer and future Pakistan Army general. He remained in the army for a short period after the war, receiving promotion to acting lieutenant-colonel in 1945 and to war-substantive major and temporary lieutenant-colonel on 19 February 1946. In 1947, Faiz opted for the newly established State of Pakistan. However, after witnessing the 1947 Kashmir war with India, Faiz decided to leave the army and submitted his resignation in 1947.

===Internationalism and communism===

Faiz believed in internationalism and emphasised the philosophy of the global village. In 1947, he became editor of the &quot;Pakistan Times&quot; and in 1948, he became vice-president of the Pakistan Trade Union Federation (PTUF). In 1950, Faiz joined the delegation of Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan, initially leading a business delegation in the United States, attending the meeting at the International Labour Organization (ILO) at San Francisco. During 1948–50, Faiz led the PTUF&#x27;s delegation in Geneva, and became an active member of World Peace Council (WPC).

Faiz was a well-known communist in the country and had been long associated with the Communist Party of Pakistan, which he founded in 1947 along with Marxist Sajjad Zaheer and Jalaludin Abdur Rahim. Faiz had his first exposure to socialism and communism before the independence of State of Pakistan which he thought was consistent with his progressive thinking. Faiz had long associated ties with the Soviet Union, a friendship with atheist country that later honoured him with high award. Even after his death, the Russian government honoured him by calling him &quot;our poet&quot; to many Russians. However his popularity was waned in Bangladesh after 1971 when Dhaka did not win much support for him. Faiz and other pro-communists had no political role in the country, despite their academic brilliance.

Although Faiz was a not a hardcore or far-left communist, he spent most of the 1950s and 1960s promoting the cause of communism in Pakistan. During the time when Faiz was editor of the &quot;Pakistan Times&quot;, one of the leading newspapers of the 1950s, he lent editorial support to the party. He was also involved in the circle lending support to military personnel (e.g. Major General Akbar Khan). His involvement with the party and Major General Akbar Khan&#x27;s coup plan led to his imprisonment later.

Later in his life, while giving an interview with a local newspaper, Faiz was asked by the interviewer if he was a communist. He replied with characteristic nonchalance: &quot;No. I am not, a communist is a person who is a card carrying member of the Communist party. The party is banned in our country. So how can I be a communist?...&quot;.

===Rawalpindi plot and exile===
Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s government failure to capture Indian-administered Kashmir had frustrated the military leaders of the Pakistan Armed Forces in 1948, including Jinnah. A writer had argued that Jinnah had serious doubt of Ali Khan&#x27;s ability to ensure the integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan. After returning from the United States, Ali Khan imposed restrictions on Communist party as well as Pakistan Socialist Party. Although the East Pakistan Communist Party had ultimate success in East-Pakistan after staging the mass protest to recognise Bengali language as national language.

After Jinnah founded it, the Muslim League was struggling to survive in West-Pakistan. Therefore, Prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan imposed extreme restrictions and applied tremendous pressure on the communist party that ensured it was not properly allowed to function openly as a political party. The conspiracy had been planned by left-wing military officer and Chief of General Staff Major-General Akbar Khan. On 23 February 1951, a secret meeting was held at General Akbar&#x27;s home, attended by other communist officers and communist party members, including Marxist Sajjad Zaheer and communist Faiz. General Akbar assured Faiz and Zaheer that the communist party would be allowed to function as a legitimate political party like any other party and to take part in the elections. But, according to communist Zafar Poshni who maintained, in 2011, that &quot;no agreement was reached, the plan was disapproved, the communists weren&#x27;t ready to accept General&#x27;s words and the participants dispersed without meeting again&quot;. However the next morning, the plot was foiled when one of the communist officer defected to the &quot;ISI&quot; revealing the motives behind the plot. When the news reached the Prime minister, orders for massive arrests were given to the Military Police by the Prime minister. Before the coup could be initiated, General Akbar among other communists were arrested, including Faiz. In a trial led by the Judge Advocate General branch&#x27;s officers in a military court, Faiz was announced to have spent four years in Montgomery Central Jail (MCJ), due to his influential personality, Liaquat Ali Khan&#x27;s government continued locating him in Central Prison Karachi and the Central Jail Mianwali. The socialist Huseyn Suhravardie was his defence counselor. Finally on 2 April 1955, Faiz&#x27;s sentence was commuted by the Prime minister Huseyn Suhrawardy, and he departed to London, Great Britain soon after. In 1958, Faiz returned but was again detained by President Iskander Mirza, who allegedly blamed Faiz for publishing pro-communist ideas and for advocating a pro-Moscow government. However, due to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s influence on Ayub Khan, Faiz&#x27;s sentence was commuted in 1960 and he left for Moscow, Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, eventually settling in London, United Kingdom.

===Return to Pakistan and government work===

In 1964, Faiz finally returned to his country and settled down in Karachi, and was appointed Rector of Abdullah Haroon College. Having served as the secretary of the Pakistan Arts Council from 1959 to 1962, he became its vice-president the same year.

In 1965, Faiz was first brought to government by the charismatic democratic socialist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who was serving as Foreign minister in the presidency of Ayub Khan. Bhutto lobbied for Faiz and gave him an honorary capacity at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB) working to rallying the people of West-Pakistan to fight against India to defend their motherland. During the 1971 &quot;Winter war&quot;, Faiz rallied to mobilise the people, writing poems and songs that opposed the bloodshed during the Bangladesh Liberation War.

In 1972, Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto brought him back when Bhutto appointed Faiz as Culture adviser at the Ministry of Culture (MoCul) and the Ministry of Education (MoEd). Faiz continued serving in Bhutto&#x27;s government until 1974 when he took retirement from the government assignments.

Faiz had strong ties with Bhutto and was deeply upset upon Bhutto&#x27;s removal by Chief of Army Staff General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 in a military coup code-named &quot;Fair Play&quot;. Again, Faiz was monitored by Military Police and his every move was watched. In 1979, Faiz departed from Pakistan after learning the news that Bhutto&#x27;s execution had taken place. Faiz took asylum in Beirut, Lebanon, where he edited the Egyptian- and Soviet-sponsored magazine &quot;Lotus&quot; and met well-known Arab figures like Edward Said and Yasser Arafat, but returned to Pakistan in poor health after the renewal of the Lebanon War in 1982.

== Themes and writing style ==
Faiz&#x27;s early poetry focused on traditional tropes of romantic love, beauty, and heartbreak but eventually expanded to include themes of justice, rebellion, politics, and the interconnectedness of humanity. Therefore, although many of Faiz&#x27;s poems focus on themes of romantic love and loss, most literary critics do not consider him primarily a romantic poet, emphasising that themes of justice and revolution take precedence in his extensive body of work. Other critics see his poetry as an unconventional fusion of love and revolution that appeals to the new-age reader &quot;who loves his beloved yet lives for humanity.&quot;

Faiz&#x27;s poetry is replete with progressivist and revolutionist ideas and he is often referred to as &quot;an artistic rebel.&quot; He is widely considered the poet of the oppressed and downtrodden classes and is known for highlighting their poverty, social discrimination, economic exploitation, and political repression. His poetry was heavily leftist as well as anti-capitalist in tone and ideas, and his poems are almost always a reflection of his time, focusing heavily on the suffering of ordinary people. Many of Faiz&#x27;s poems also revolve around themes of home, exile, and loss, leading UCLA researcher Aamir R. Mufti to assert that one of the predominant themes in Faiz&#x27;s poetry is the meaning, implications, and legacy of the partition of India.

Faiz&#x27;s writing style is sometimes characterised as occupying a space between romance and love on the one hand and realism and revolution on the other. Although he wrote prolifically on the topics of justice, resistance, and revolution, Faiz rarely allowed political rhetoric to overpower his poetry. Not a proponent of the &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; philosophy, Faiz believed that art that does not inspire people to take action is not great art. Faiz&#x27;s poetry often features religious symbolism inspired by Sufism and not by religious dogma. Faiz&#x27;s grandson, Dr. Ali Madeeh Hashmi, has asserted that he was particularly influenced by Sufi figures such as Rumi, that he regretted not having memorized more of the Qur&#x27;an, and that ideologically he proposed a form of Islamic socialism.

Faiz&#x27;s prose works tend to be written in strict classical Urdu diction while his poetry is known to have a more conversational and casual tenor. His ghazals are often hailed for skillfully infusing socio-economic and political issues into conventional motifs of the ghazal such as love and separation. Critics have noted that many of Faiz&#x27;s poems start by making the reader aware of dire socio-political realities but ultimately strike a note of encouragement and hope that desperate circumstances will inevitably change for the better.

Some critics have argued that verses written by Faiz in the final years of his life differ in tone and content from the poetry he wrote when he was younger, particularly the poems written while he was incarcerated. His later-stage poetry is said to be more universal in tone, possessing a greater urgency for change and action, and as being more explicit and forthright in its challenge to &quot;decadent tradition.&quot;

== Death and legacy ==
=== Last days ===
Faiz died in Lahore, Punjab in 1984, from complications of lung and heart disease shortly after being nominated for the Nobel Prize for Literature.

=== Recognition in Pakistan ===
Although living a simple and restless life, Faiz&#x27;s work, political ideology, and poetry became immortal, and he has often been called as one of the &quot;greatest poets&quot; of Pakistan. Faiz remained an extremely popular and influential figure in the literary development of Pakistan&#x27;s arts, literature, and drama and theatre adaptation. In 1962, Faiz was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize which enhanced the relations of his country with the Soviet Union which at that time had been hostile and antagonistic relations with Pakistan. The Lenin Peace Prize was a Soviet equivalent of Nobel Peace Prize, and helped lift Faiz&#x27;s image even higher in the international community. It also brought Soviet Union and Pakistan much closer, offering possibilities for bettering the lives of their people. Most of his work has been translated into the Russian language.

Faiz, whose work is considered the backbone of development of Pakistan&#x27;s literature, arts and poetry, was one of the most beloved poets in the country. Along with Allama Iqbal, Faiz is often known as the &quot;Poet of the East&quot;. While commenting on his legacy, classical singer Tina Sani said:

===Accolades and international recognition===
Faiz was the first Asian poet to receive the Lenin Peace Prize, awarded by the Soviet Union in 1962. In 1976 he was awarded the Lotus Prize for Literature. He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize shortly before his death in 1984. At the Lenin Peace Prize ceremony, held in the grand Kremlin hall in Moscow, Faiz thanked the Soviet government for conferring the honour, and delivered an acceptance speech, which appears as a brief preface to his collection &quot;Dast-i-tah-i-Sang&quot; (Hand Under the Rock):

In 1990, Faiz was posthumously honoured by the Pakistan Government when the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party led by Prime minister Benazir Bhutto awarded Faiz the highest civilian award, the &quot;Nishan-e-Imtiaz,&quot; in 1990. In 2011, the Pakistan Peoples Party&#x27;s government declared the year 2011 as &quot;the year of Faiz Ahmad Faiz&quot;. In accordance, the Pakistan Government set up a &quot;Faiz Chair&quot; at the Department of Urdu at the Karachi University and at the Sindh University, followed by the Government College University of Lahore established the Patras, Faiz Chair at the Department of Urdu of the university, also in 2011. The same year, the Government College University (GCU) presented golden shields to the University&#x27;s Urdu department. The shields were issued and presented by the GCU vice-chancellor Professor Dr. Khaleequr Rehman, who noted and further wrote: &quot;Faiz was poet of humanity, love and resistance against oppression&quot;. In 2012, at the memorial ceremony that was held at the Jinnah Garden to honour the services of Faiz by the left-wing party Avami National Party and Communist Party, participants chanted: &quot;The Faiz of workers is alive! The Faiz of farmers is alive...! Faiz is alive...!&quot; at the end of the ceremony.

=== In popular culture ===
A collection of some of Faiz&#x27;s celebrated poetry was published in 2011, under the name of &quot;Celebrating Faiz&quot; edited by D P Tripathi. The book also included tributes by his family, by contemporaries and by scholars who knew of him through his poetry. The book was released on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s birth anniversary in the Punjab province in Pakistan. A Faiz poem is read in the British 2021 television sitcom We Are Lady Parts. In Nawaaz Ahmed&#x27;s novel, &quot;Radiant Fugitives,&quot; a Faiz poem is recalled as the poem that the mother, Nafeesa, recites during a college jubilee celebration that attracts her soon-to-be husband.

Faiz&#x27;s poetic compositions have featured regularly on Coke Studio Pakistan. In Season 3, &quot;Mori Araj Sunno&quot; was performed by Tina Sani, which also fused &quot;Rabb Sacheya&quot;. Later in Season 5, &quot;Rabba Sacheya&quot; was performed by Atif Aslam. Season 10 featured his poem &quot;Bol Ke Lab Azaad Hain Tere&quot; (performed by Shafqat Amanat Ali) and &quot;Mujhse Pehli Si Mohabbat&quot; (performed by Humaira Channa &amp; Nabeel Shaukat Ali). Season 11 featured Faiz&#x27;s well-known revolutionary song &quot;Hum Dekhenge&quot; (performed by featured artists for the season). Season 12 featured the songs &quot;Gulon Main Rang&quot; (performed by Ali Sethi) and &quot;Aaye Kuch Abr&quot; (performed by Atif Aslam).

&quot;Gulon Main Rang&quot;, composed and performed by Mehdi Hasan, was later performed by Arijit Singh, for Bollywood movie Haider.

===Translations===
Faiz&#x27;s poetry has been translated into many languages including English and Russian. A Balochi poet, Mir Gul Khan Nasir, who was also a friend of Faiz Ahmad Faiz, translated his book &quot;Sar-e-Wadi-e-Seena&quot; into Balochi with the title &quot;Seenai Keechag aa&quot;. Gul Khan&#x27;s translation was written while he was in jail during Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto&#x27;s regime for opposing the government&#x27;s policies. It was only published in 1980, after Zia-ul-Haq toppled Bhutto&#x27;s government and freed all the political prisoners of his (Bhutto&#x27;s) regime. Victor Kiernan, British Marxist historian translated Faiz Ahmad Faiz&#x27;s works into English, and several other translations of whole or part of his work into English have also been made by others; a transliteration in Punjabi was made by Mohinder Singh.

Faiz Ahmad Faiz, himself, also translated works of notable poets from other languages into Urdu. In his book &quot;Sar-i Waadi-i Seena سرِ وادیِ سینا&quot; there are translations of the famous poet of Dagestan, Rasul Gamzatov. &quot;Deewa&quot;, a Balochi poem by Mir Gul Khan Nasir, was also translated into Urdu by Faiz.

=== Faiz Foundation Trust and International Faiz Festival ===
Created in 2009, the Faiz Foundation Trust holds the copyright for all literary works of Faiz Ahmad Faiz. It also runs a not-for-profit organisation known as &quot;Faiz Ghar&quot; (House of Faiz) with the mission to promote the humanistic ideas of Faiz as well as art, literature, and culture in general. The organisation also houses Faiz&#x27;s personal library and much of his memorabilia including rare photographs, academic diplomas, and his letters and manuscripts. In 2015, the Faiz Foundation Trust launched the inaugural International Faiz Festival in collaboration with the Lahore Arts Council at Alhamra in Lahore, Pakistan. Held regularly since then, the festival is aimed at promoting Urdu poetry, music, literature, drama, and human rights in Pakistan.

==Personal life==
In 1941, Faiz became involved with Alys Faiz, a British national and a member of Communist Party of the United Kingdom, who was a student at the Government College University where Faiz taught poetry. The marriage ceremony took place in Srinagar, while the nikah ceremony was performed at Pari Mahal. Faiz and his wife lived in the building that is now Government College for Women, M.A. Road. Faiz&#x27;s host, M. D. Taseer, who was serving as the college principal at the time, was later married to Alys&#x27;s sister, Christobel. Faiz&#x27;s nikah ceremony was attended by Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, Ghulam Mohammed Sadiq, and Sheikh Abdullah among others. While Alys opted for Pakistan citizenship, she was a vital member of Communist Party of Pakistan and played a significant role in Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case when she brought together the communist mass. Faiz and his wife have two daughters, Salima Hashmi and Muneeza Hashmi.

<text>In mathematics, a zero-dimensional topological space (or nildimensional space) is a topological space that has dimension zero with respect to one of several inequivalent notions of assigning a dimension to a given topological space. A graphical illustration of a zero-dimensional space is a point.

== Definition ==
Specifically:
* A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the Lebesgue covering dimension if every open cover of the space has a refinement that is a cover by disjoint open sets.
* A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the finite-to-finite covering dimension if every finite open cover of the space has a refinement that is a finite open cover such that any point in the space is contained in exactly one open set of this refinement.
* A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the small inductive dimension if it has a base consisting of clopen sets.
The three notions above agree for separable, metrisable spaces.

== Properties of spaces with small inductive dimension zero ==
* A zero-dimensional Hausdorff space is necessarily totally disconnected, but the converse fails. However, a locally compact Hausdorff space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected. (See for the non-trivial direction.)
* Zero-dimensional Polish spaces are a particularly convenient setting for descriptive set theory. Examples of such spaces include the Cantor space and Baire space.
* Hausdorff zero-dimensional spaces are precisely the subspaces of topological powers formula_1 where formula_2 is given the discrete topology. Such a space is sometimes called a Cantor cube. If is countably infinite, formula_1 is the Cantor space.

== Manifolds ==
All points of a zero-dimensional manifold are isolated.

<doc id="517687" wikidata="Q1061090" url="?curid=517687" title="Battle of Philippi (1861)">
<text>The Battle of Philippi formed part of the Western Virginia Campaign of the American Civil War and was fought in and around Philippi, Virginia (now West Virginia), on June 3, 1861. A Union Army victory, it was the first organized land action of the war, though generally viewed as a skirmish rather than a battle. 

The Northern press, however, celebrated it as an epic triumph and this encouraged Congress to call for the drive on Richmond that ended with the Union defeat at First Bull Run in July. It brought overnight fame to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and was notable for the first battlefield amputations. As the first of a series of victories that pushed Confederate forces out of northwest Virginia, it strengthened the Union government in exile that would soon create the new state of West Virginia.

As the largely-untrained Confederates had fled the battlefield with barely any resistance, the Union jokingly referred to the engagement as the Philippi Races.

==Background==
After the commencement of hostilities at Fort Sumter in April 1861, Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan returned to the Army and on May 13 assumed command of the Department of the Ohio, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. McClellan planned an offensive into what is now the State of West Virginia (at the time the northwestern counties of the Commonwealth of Virginia) which he hoped would lead to a campaign against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. His immediate objectives were to occupy the territory to protect the largely pro-Union populace in the counties along the Ohio River, and to keep open the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad line, a critical supply line for the Union.

On May 26, McClellan, in response to the burning of bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Farmington, West Virginia, ordered Col. Benjamin Franklin Kelley of the (Union) 1st West Virginia Infantry with his regiment and Company A of the 2nd West Virginia Infantry, to advance from Wheeling to the area and safeguard the important bridge over the Monongahela River at Fairmont, a distance of about southeast of Wheeling. Kelley&#x27;s men were supported by the 16th Ohio Infantry under Col. James Irvine. After securing Fairmont, the 1st West Virginia advanced again and seized the important railroad junction of Grafton, about southeast of Fairmont, on May 30.
McClellan confided to Winfield Scott on June 4 that he had used the western Virginia regiments to avoid claims of interference in Virginia affairs, but told Scott that &quot;comparatively few of the Virginia troops thus far raised,&quot; such as those in Kelley&#x27;s command, were really Virginians but &quot;mostly from Penna and Ohio.&quot;

Meanwhile, the 14th Ohio Infantry Regiment, under Col. James B. Steedman, was ordered to occupy Parkersburg and then proceed to Grafton, about to the east. By May 28, McClellan had ordered a total of about 3,000 troops into Western Virginia and placed them under the overall command of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Morris, commander of Indiana Volunteers. 
On May 4 Confederate Col. George A. Porterfield had been assigned command of the state forces in northwestern Virginia and ordered to Grafton to take charge of enlistments in the area. As the Union columns advanced, Porterfield&#x27;s poorly armed 800 recruits retreated to Philippi, about south of Grafton. Philippi was the county seat of Barbour County, which had voted in favor of Virginia&#x27;s secession ordinance. A palmetto secession flag had been flying above the courthouse since January, 1861. At Philippi, a covered bridge spanned the Tygart Valley River and was an important segment of the vital Beverly–Fairmont Turnpike.

While Porterfield had a command of regimental strength it was composed of independent companies that had not yet been formally organized into regiments. Most were local recruits from Taylor, Pocahontas, Upshur, Hardy, Pendleton, Harrison, Barbour, Marion and the Valley counties of Augusta, Bath, Rockbridge, and Highland. The companies were the Letcher Guards, Pocahontas Rescues, Upshur Grays, Franklin Guards, Hardy Blues, Marion Guards, Harrison Rifles, Highland County Highlanders, Barbour Grays, Potomac Guards, Bath Grays, Second Rockbridge Dragoons, Churchville Cavalry and the Barbour Lighthorse Cavalry. These companies were eventually organized into the 25th Virginia Infantry, the 31st Virginia Infantry, The 11th Virginia Cavalry and the 14th Virginia Cavalry, with the Barbour Lighthorse Cavalry disbanding after the battle.

==Battle==
Col. Kelley devised a two-prong attack against the Confederate force in Philippi, approved by Gen. Morris on his arrival in Grafton on June 1. The principal advance would be 1,600 men led by Kelley himself, and would include six companies of his own regiment, nine of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under Col. Robert H. Milroy, and six of the 16th Ohio Infantry. In order to deceive the enemy into thinking the objective was Harpers Ferry, they departed by train to the east. They disembarked at the small village of Thornton and marched south on a back road on the same side of the river as Philippi, intending to arrive at the rear of the town.

Meanwhile, the 7th Indiana under Col. Ebenezer Dumont were sent to Webster, about southwest of Grafton. They would unite with the 6th Indiana under Col. Thomas T. Crittenden and the 14th Ohio under Col. Steedman. The column, with a total of 1,400 men under Col. Dumont (with the assistance of Col. Frederick W. Lander, volunteer aide-de-camp to Gen. McClellan), would march directly south from Webster on the Turnpike. In this way, the Union force would execute a double envelopment of the outnumbered Confederates.

On June 2, the Union columns set off to converge on Philippi. After an overnight march in rainy weather, both arrived at Philippi before dawn the following morning. Morris had planned a predawn assault to be signaled by a pistol shot. The green Confederate volunteers had failed to establish picket lines for perimeter security, choosing instead to escape the cold rain and stay inside their tents. A Confederate sympathizer, Mrs. Thomas Humphreys, saw the approaching Union troops and sent her young son on horseback to warn the Confederates. As Mrs. Humphreys watched, she saw Union pickets capture her son and fired her pistol at them. She missed, but her shots began the attack prematurely.

The Union attackers began firing their artillery, which awakened the Confederates from their slumber. Those who were armed fired a few shots at the advancing bluecoats, then Southerners broke and began running to the south, some still in their bed clothes. This caused Union journalists to refer to the battle as the &quot;Races at Philippi&quot;. Dumont&#x27;s soldiers entered the town from the bridge (Col. Lander&#x27;s ride down the steep hillside through heavy underbrush was considered such a feat of horsemanship that &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot; gave an illustrated account of it shortly afterward), but Kelley&#x27;s column had arrived from the north on the wrong road and were unable to block the Confederate retreat. Kelley himself was shot while pursuing some of the retreating Confederates, but Col. Lander chased down and captured the man who shot Kelley. The Confederates retreated to Huttonsville, about to the south.

==Aftermath==
Philippi was the first organized land action in the war (the impromptu Battle of Fairfax Court House, two days earlier, could not be counted as such), and Union victory in this relatively bloodless battle propelled McClellan into the national spotlight. The Northern press, hungry for battle stories, presented it as an epic triumph, encouraging politicians to demand the big advance on Richmond, which became Bull Run. 

The civilian population of Philippi were the first in western Virginia to feel the devastation of the war. The town was primarily secessionist in sentiment, and many had fled south with as many of their valuables as they could carry in fear of the Federal advance. In July, a month after the battle, it was reported that &quot;with the exception of our troop [Philippi] is almost deserted, only three families having as yet returned, among them is Mr. Wilson and family, one of the most influential families in Barbour county.&quot; A correspondent of the &quot;Cincinnati Times&quot; wrote &quot;The village bears more than any other I have seen, the ruinous effect of the war. Many of the houses have been sacked and maliciously damaged. Not the half of them are now occupied, the inhabitants having fled. It was a rabid secession town, and the women yet lean strongly that way.&quot; A record book of soldier violations was found a few months after the battle containing the following entries: &quot;Edward F. Grant enters a complaint against Colonel McCook&#x27;s 9th Ohio Regiment for breaking into the houses of Haynes and Hovatter, June 25, 1 p.m.&quot; &quot;Two privates in the guard house for stealing glassware and vegetables.&quot; &quot;Four men in the guard house for theft. Discharged.&quot; &quot;Ninety-six men in guard house for breaking into dwellings and houses.&quot; Many of the men of Philippi had left before or just after the battle, some not returning until after the war and leaving the women to care for families and property.

There were two significant Confederate casualties. Both were treated with battlefield amputations, believed to be the first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. Hanger, an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, Hanger returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge at the knee. His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the “Hanger Limb” for other wounded soldiers. After the war, Hanger patented his prosthetic device and founded what is now the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. As of 2007, Hanger Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs.

Following the battle, Col. Porterfield was replaced in command of Confederate forces in western Virginia by Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett. 

The short-story writer and satirist Ambrose Bierce (1842–&quot;ca.&quot; 1914) was a Union recruit at the Battle of Philippi. Twenty years later, he wrote, in an autobiographical fragment he called :

The quotation marks indicate the wryness with which Bierce and his fellow veterans, who were to undergo far more harrowing fights, must have regarded the designation of &quot;first battle&quot;.

<text>Cabourg (; ) is a commune in the Calvados department, region of Normandy, France. Cabourg is on the coast of the English Channel, at the mouth of the river Dives. The back country is a plain, favourable to the culture of cereal. The town sits on the Côte Fleurie (Flowery Coast) and its population increases by over 40,000 during the summer.

== Geography ==
Cabourg is located on the north of France between Caen and Deauville, part of the Côte Fleurie. The town is on the Dives river, across from Dives-sur-Mer.

On 1 January 2017, the town was transferred from the Arrondissement of Caen to that of Lisieux.

=== Climate ===
Cabourg has an Oceanic climate with mild summers and cool winters. The proximity of the sea limits large variations in temperature and creates winters without much frost and summers without excessive heat. Wind is frequent especially on the beach.

==History==
It was from Cabourg that William the Conqueror drove the troops of Henry I of France back into the sea in 1058.

According to Marcel Proust&#x27;s biographer George D. Painter:

==Population==
Cabourg contains a large amount of secondary/vacation residences. In 2020, there were 10,867 homes with 79.7% of them being classified as &quot;Secondary residences and occasional accommodations&quot;. 

==Culture==
Each year in June, Cabourg hosts the &quot;International Festival of the Romantic Movie&quot;.

==Sport==
SU Dives-Cabourg is the local football team, after the merger of AS Cabourg with Sport Union Divaise in May 2016, it is based in neighbouring Dives-sur-Mer. 

== Personalities ==

Cabourg is famous for being Marcel Proust&#x27;s favorite vacation place at the beginning of the 20th century; it is the inspiration for Balbec, the seaside resort in Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;.

<doc id="517692" wikidata="Q1185336" url="?curid=517692" title="Fort Henry National Historic Site">
<text>Fort Henry National Historic Site is located in Kingston, Ontario, Canada on Point Henry, a strategic, elevated point near the mouth of the Cataraqui River where it flows into the St. Lawrence River at the east end of Lake Ontario. The fort and the point on which the fort was built were named after Henry Hamilton, former Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec.

A fortification was constructed during the War of 1812 to protect the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard (the site of the present-day Royal Military College of Canada) on Point Frederick from a possible American attack during the war and to monitor maritime traffic on the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. A much larger fort replaced this construction in the 1830s to maintain protection of the naval dockyard and protect the southern entrance to the Rideau Canal. The fort was restored in the 1930s and is a significant tourist attraction.

==History==

===Background===
Interest in Point Henry as a defensible strategic location was first noted by the British in 1783. At that time, the British military established a post in what is now Kingston by partly refurbishing and garrisoning the ruined French fort (Fort Frontenac). The garrison and the developing townsite near the fort were deemed difficult to defend and so Captain John Ross, the British officer in charge of settling Loyalist refugees in the area following the American Revolutionary War, proposed moving the stronghold along with the townsite to the more defensible Point Henry. British-American hostilities still concerned the British, and the high promontory of Point Henry was considered to be a good location for a defensive fortification. 

In 1794, Lord Dorchester ordered the survey of Point Henry, Point Frederick, and &quot;the adjacent Country and Coves taking in whatever may lye near enough to affect the Security or convenience of the Port&quot; to investigate the location of a navy base. Lt. Alexander Bryce of the Royal Engineers preferred Haldimand Cove (now Navy Bay) as a navy base and recommended a fortification on Point Henry to defend it. However, a fortification was not built on the hill until the beginning of the War of 1812.

===Early fortification===

At the beginning of the War of 1812, local militia erected a blockhouse and battery on Point Henry to defend the important naval base on Point Frederick, located across Haldimand Cove to the west, and to monitor maritime traffic on the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario. On November 10, 1812, this battery was involved in repelling several American warships that were attacking the Provincial Marine sloop &quot;Royal George&quot; as the ship was taking refuge in Kingston Harbour. This naval action strengthened the view that a stronger fortification was needed and so the militia and regular army began building batteries and barracks in 1813. The fort was one of several defensive structures built in and around Kingston during the war.

By 1820 the fort consisted of earth and stone ramparts, demi-bastions, redans, ditches, magazines, barracks, signal towers and support batteries.

===Second fort===
Distrust between the Americans and British continued after the War of 1812. This led to the original fort being demolished to make way for a more extensive fort, which was constructed between 1832 and 1836 to defend the Lake Ontario end of the strategic Rideau Canal, the harbour, and the naval dockyard. In 1843, the advanced battery overlooking the lake to the south was completed when the casemated commissariat stores and magazines were built. These stone buildings connected the advanced battery to the main redoubt. A system of more elaborate defensive works was planned but cost overruns in the construction of the canal limited the fortifications to four Martello towers and the fort itself. At the time, these fortifications were the strongest defences in Canada west of Quebec City. Neither the original nor the second Fort Henry was ever attacked. The fort was once referred to as the &quot;Citadel of Upper Canada&quot;.
Imperial (British) troops were deployed at the site of Fort Henry from 1813 to 1870. The Canadian Militia then garrisoned the fort until 1891. British garrisons included the Royal Regiment of Artillery, 24th Regiment of Foot, Black Watch, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Canadian Rifle Regiment. Canadian units who used the fort include &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&#x27; Batteries of Garrison Artillery, and the 14th Battalion, Princess of Wales&#x27; Own Rifles. As relations with the United States continued to improve, the need for defences along the border ceased. Abandoned by the military, the fort fell into disrepair.

Fort Henry temporarily held prisoners of the 1837–38 Rebellions. German, Austrian and Turkish prisoners of war and some civilians, including Ukrainian immigrants described as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; during Canada&#x27;s first national internment operations of 1914–1920 were also held at the fort. During the Second World War, the fort served as a prisoner of war camp for German Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel.

==Present use==
In the 1930s, under the leadership of Ronald L. Way, restorations took place as part of a government work program during the Great Depression. &quot;Old Fort Henry&quot; became a living museum with the introduction of the Fort Henry Guard, and was opened on August 1, 1938.

Fort Henry is administered by Parks Canada and operated by the St. Lawrence Parks Commission. Uniformed military interpreters known as the Fort Henry Guard conduct demonstrations of British military life and tours for visitors. The Fort Henry Guard has a long history in itself. The Guard, founded in 1938 has been integral to the Fort&#x27;s ability to maintain the spirit of 1867 life and the preservation of the fort. The Guard is not exclusive to military interpreters but includes domestic interpreters as well. Self-guided tours are also available. Other activities and demonstrations include historical reenactments of drills and battle tactics, the Garrison Parade, the Victorian School Room, and the Muster Parade, where young visitors are dressed in period uniforms and taught to march by a qualified member of the Guard. A Sunset Ceremony is held every Wednesday in July and August, where a full program of historic drill, music and artillery is presented. During evenings year-round a tour company conducts tours of the fort that highlight the fort&#x27;s supposedly haunted past.

Fort Henry has been designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, and in 2007 was included in the designation of the Rideau Canal as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

==Legacy==
On 30 June 1983 Canada Post issued &#x27;Fort Henry, Ont.&#x27; in the &quot;Forts Across Canada Series&quot; (1983 and 1985). The stamps are based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.

<text>Monia Mazigh () (born 1970) is a Canadian author and academic best known for her efforts to free her husband Maher Arar from a Syrian prison. A resident of Ottawa, Ontario, she was the New Democratic Party candidate for the riding of Ottawa South, a traditionally Liberal riding, in the 2004 federal election. In June 2015 she was appointed National Coordinator of the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group.

==Early life and education==
Mazigh was born and raised in Tunisia and emigrated to Canada in 1991, at the age of 21. She has a PhD in financial economics from McGill University and speaks Arabic, English and French fluently. In 2000, she started working for the University of Ottawa as a research assistant and later as a French-language instructor. She has stated that until 2002, her goal was to become a professor instead of a politician.

==The Maher Arar case and political activism==
Mazigh first entered the public spotlight when her husband was deported to Syria in 2002 by the US government, on suspicion of terrorist links. He was tortured and held without charge for over a year before being returned to Canada. Mazigh joined with a number of human rights groups to press the government for his release. She appeared frequently in the media and was widely respected for her tireless efforts. Of her willingness to speak out, she has said that she was never afraid: &quot;I had lost my life. I didn&#x27;t have more to lose.&quot;

She was courted by the Liberal Party, but chose to stand as a candidate for the NDP. Mazigh had reportedly grown personally close with NDP foreign affairs critic, and former federal leader, Alexa McDonough, and she perceived the NDP as having been more emphatic than the other parties in calling for her husband&#x27;s release. During a leaders&#x27; debate, NDP leader Jack Layton said that the party was proud to have her as a candidate. However, Mazigh&#x27;s candidacy was unusual in that Mazigh personally does not support same-sex marriage; had she been elected she would have been the only NDP MP, alongside Desmond McGrath, NDP candidate in the riding of Random-Burin-St. George&#x27;s in Newfoundland and Labrador, to oppose same-sex marriage by abstaining from a vote. While campaigning Mazigh said that she would abstain if Parliament was ever called to vote on the issue because of her reluctance to vote against a human rights issue. She also joined several individuals and groups in criticizing the NDP&#x27;s more friendly attitude to Israel following the departure of Svend Robinson from the role of foreign affairs critic.

She ran against but lost to Liberal candidate David McGuinty, the brother of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty. Despite finishing third, her 8,080 votes were the highest the NDP has ever won in Ottawa South federally or provincially until Henri Sader won 8,138 votes in 2006.

After running in the election, she worked for a while as a policy researcher at NDP headquarters in Ottawa. Some of her areas of expertise included economics (such as budget issues) and child care. She was employed as a professor of finance, at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia for about one year until spring 2007. She currently resides in Ottawa.

In 2011, Mazigh endorsed the Canadian Boat to Gaza, part of the Freedom Flotilla 2 which aims to end the Israeli blockade imposed on the 1.6 million Palestinian civilians living in the Gaza Strip.

Her book &quot;Gendered Islamophobia: My Journey with a Scar(f)&quot; was shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language non-fiction at the 2023 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

<doc id="517712" wikidata="Q7653861" url="?curid=517712" title="Swarfega">
<text>Swarfega () is a brand of heavy-duty hand cleaner made by Deb Limited, a British company based in Denby, Derbyshire. It is used in engineering, construction, and other manual trades, such as printing.

It is a gelatinous, thixotropic substance, dark green or orange in colour, which is used to clean grease, oil, printer&#x27;s ink, or general persistent, hydrophobic dirt from the skin. Swarfega works a small amount into dry skin and then wipes or rinses off. As with other such cleaners, it can be more effective than soap or other common cleansing products at removing such dirt; accordingly, Swarfega has become virtually ubiquitous in environments where this kind of dirt is common, such as garages and machine shops.

==History==
Swarfega was invented in 1947 by Audley Bowdler Williamson (28 February 1916 - 21 November 2004), an industrial chemist from Heanor, Derbyshire. In 1941, he founded a detergent-sales company, Deb Silkware Protection Ltd., based in Belper, to produce a formulation for extending the life of silk stockings. The name derived from &quot;debutante&quot;, to signify the newness of the company and its products. The introduction of nylon stockings threatened to render it superfluous; however, Williamson purportedly suggested that mechanics had already found it useful for cleaning their hands. This myth may have been encouraged to attract interest, but the product was reformulated and marketed as Swarfega, becoming the company&#x27;s main product. (The company&#x27;s name had been changed to Deb Chemical Proprietaries Ltd.) Before Swarfega, mechanics used a variety of harsh home-brewed cleaners such as paraffin (kerosene), sand, and petrol. These removed the skin&#x27;s natural oils, leading to dry, cracked skin and the risk of occupational dermatitis. The effectiveness of Swarfega is due to the hydrophobic ingredients, including medium-chain (C9-C16) alkanes and cycloalkanes in combination with an emulsifier (Trideceth-5 in current formulations). These are more efficient at solubilizing oil and grease than a detergent alone.

In the UK, &quot;Swarfega&quot; may be a generic term for all similar cleaners, particularly if they have the same green jelly-like appearance as genuine Swarfega. According to the company website, the name derives from &quot;swarf&quot;, a Derbyshire word for oil and grease, and &quot;ega&quot;, as in &quot;eager to clean&quot;. &quot;Swarf&quot; now commonly refers to the metal shavings and chips resulting from metalworking operations. The word did not initially mean oil or grease as Deb claimed, but rather the waste material from a grindstone (or similar material resulting from wear in a machine). This material would be a wet or oily mixture of grit abraded from the wheel and filings from the workpiece.

Deb has expanded its product range and has long offered products related to detergent ingredients or sold to the same mechanical trades. Many of these, such as Jizer, a water-rinsable degreaser used for washing mechanical parts rather than mechanics, first defined the original market for a new product that has become commonplace.

It was reported on 3 March 2010 that the manufacturer of Swarfega had been sold to an investment firm for £325 million.

In 2015, Deb Group Ltd. was acquired by S. C. Johnson &amp; Son.

==Competing products==
Swarfega has lost the ubiquity it once had. Many competing products exist, such as Rozalex Two Fives and Rozalex Gauntlet. Deb has even repositioned their own &quot;Suprega&quot; and &quot;Tufanega&quot; for industrial use. This has an orange colour, emphasising its &quot;natural&quot; origins and citrus oil ingredients. A similar orange-coloured product called &quot;Dirty Paws&quot; was available in the UK in the 1950s but is no longer available.

<text>Within the fields of computer science and robotics, interaction protocols are possible communication scenarios between individual agents in multi-agent systems. Some protocols are described quite qualitatively (for example, many parts of the traffic code), but others have a formal model, whose implementations can be tested for conformance (for example, some cryptographic protocols).

FIPA defines markup for interaction protocol diagrams and several standard interaction protocols, including Dutch auction, English auction and reply-response.

<text>West Montrose is an unincorporated rural community in Woolwich Township in the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. As of the 2016 census, the population of the community 
was 257.

The settlement of West Montrose is designated as a Cultural Heritage Landscape by the Township of Woolwich because of its history of pioneer settlement, its traditional bridges and the Old Order Mennonite culture.

Located in West Montrose are single family homes, a church, a small store, a bed-and-breakfast and the West Montrose Covered Bridge, a local tourist attraction.

==History== 
West Montrose was made up of Lots Seventy, Seventy-one, and Seventy-four of the Germany Company survey in Woolwich Township. Land was purchased from the German Company sometime after 1807 by Daniel Erb, David Eby and Christian Stauffer in 1807. However it was not settled until about 1850.
A few Scots arrived at that time, including Andrew L. Anderson from Montrose, Scotland who bought land in the 1850s; presumably he named the village Montrose after his home town. The word West was added in about 1865 to differentiate the community from Montrose in Welland County.

By the early 1850s, other Mennonites from Pennsylvania began arriving to this part of Waterloo County, settling in nearby St. Jacobs and also on farms surrounding West Montrose. They were the so-called Pennsylvania Dutch. The word &quot;Dutch&quot; does not refer to the Netherlands but is a misnomer for Deitsch or Deutsch (German). Isaac Swope settled here in 1858 and built a log cabin. Many others owned land here but did not actually settle; they sold it later to other settlers. Jacob Benner, opened a woolen mill in 1858 and a sawmill in 1861. By that time, the village had a station of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The first church was built in 1862 by the United Brethren congregation which included Methodists, Baptists, and Mennonites. The first school was built in 1865. By 1869, West Montrose had a post office, a population of about 100, a lumber yard, a gunsmith, a carpenter, a hotel and keeper, a stock dealer, a post office, a general merchant, several coopers, and a minister, according to historical records. Today, several 19th Century buildings bear the Heritage designation from the Township.

There was no railway connection until 1907. By then, the population had dropped from a peak of 200 in 1890 to a mere 50. Also in 1907, the current United Church and cemetery were built; the property was historically designated by Woolwich Township in May 2014.

The horse and buggy was the primary transportation among the Mennonites for decades. Today, Old Order Mennonites still use this mode of transportation.

In 2011, residents of West Montrose were involved in a project to prevent Capital Paving from starting a gravel pit within 180 metres from the covered bridge at core of the community. The company had announced in 2008 that it planned to dig up an estimated 2.6 million tonnes of sand and gravel that sits &quot;underneath a cornfield in the Mennonite area&quot;. The volunteers of the Bridge Keepers group succeeded thanks in part to reliance on a study by the University of Waterloo&#x27;s heritage resources centre about the cultural heritage of the landscape. When Woolwich Township amended its official plan, designating the lands around West Montrose as a Cultural Heritage Landscape, Capital Paving withdrew its application. A celebration was held in September 2013; it was attended by the Chair of Waterloo Region, Ken Seiling, whose comments indicated praise for the role played by the community in preventing the gravel pit.

==Geography==

In addition to the core of the settlement, the area defined as West Montrose on the Township&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Landscape map is quite large, including the Winterbourne Mennonite Meetinghouse and Cemetery. On maps and rural addresses, the West Montrose area also extends quite far from the core, into an area that some might consider to be Winterbourne, Ontario. The Grand River flows through West Montrose.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, West Montrose had a population of 245 living in 80 of its 81 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 257. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The settlement and the surrounding countryside are noted by The Region of Waterloo Official Plan as home to a large Mennonite community. Together with nearby St. Jacobs and Elmira West Montrose lies in the centre of an area of Woolwich Township which has a historically large settlement of Old Order Mennonite families. The Mennonites are noted for their traditional customs, dress and use of horse and buggies.

==Attractions==
The West Montrose Covered Bridge over the Grand River was constructed in 1880-1881 by John and Benjamin Bear. The only covered bridge remaining in Ontario, it was designated a Provincial Historic Site in 1960. In 2007, the Township of Woolwich designated it as being of cultural heritage value or interest under the Ontario Heritage Act. It was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2007. This is one of under 200 covered bridges still surviving in Canada.

<doc id="517733" wikidata="Q2381798" url="?curid=517733" title="Clapham High Street railway station">
<text>Clapham High Street is a station on the Windrush line of the London Overground, located in Clapham in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is measured from , the former LC&amp;DR platforms also being measured from .

There is an out-of-station interchange with Clapham North tube station on the Northern line of the London Underground, located walk away from Clapham High Street station. Southeastern services from Lewisham pass through the station, however proposals to call at the station have been limited by the age of Southeastern’s rolling stock.

==History==
The station was opened on 25 August 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) as &quot;Clapham&quot;, renamed &quot;Clapham &amp; North Stockwell&quot; from May 1863. It was also known as &quot;Clapham Road&quot;, &quot;Clapham Road &amp; North Stockwell&quot;, or &quot;Clapham Town&quot;. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) route (current &quot;Atlantic Line&quot;, often referred to by its old name of &quot;South London Line&quot;) was authorized by an 1863 Act of Parliament and parallels the original 1862 LCDR route eastwards between Wandsworth Road and Brixton and beyond. Until the 1923 grouping all lines through the station were owned by the LCDR, with two leased to the LBSCR for their sole use.
The original &#x27;south&#x27; 1862 line was leased to the LBSCR in 1867 and the LCDR used the new &#x27;north&#x27; 1867 lines.

The existing platforms, together with the Grade II listed 1862 station building, form the original station. These platforms were used by the LCDR from 1862 to 1867, and the LBSCR until the 1923 grouping.

The 1867 LCDR platforms were closed on 3 April 1916 and subsequently demolished. The eastbound platform&#x27;s station building was destroyed by a bomb in 1944.

The LCDR 1866 station building (on the north side) was partially demolished in 1924 after the 1916 closure, finally being demolished in the late 1970s. In British Rail days, access to the platforms was via a subway on the north side.

The original south 1862 building was sold, being initially used as a furniture warehouse before being redeveloped in 2003 as residential accommodation. It is now Grade II listed. The platform had a full-length canopy that was demolished in the late 1970s.

The line between and was electrified at 6600 V AC on the overhead system on 1 December 1909. It was re-electrified in 1928 using third rail 660 V DC and the overhead was dismantled.

In 1937 it was renamed &quot;Clapham&quot; before receiving its current name in 1989 to avoid confusion with Clapham Junction.
In 1989 it was given a &#x27;worst station&#x27; award by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Judges wrote in their report that the corridors and stairs were &quot;filthy with broken lights, filthy paintwork which is covered in graffiti and litter including aerosols, broken glass, bricks and rags everywhere which you have to step over&quot;.

In 2012 Southern refurbished the eastbound platform, erecting a new fence and repaving the surface. In late 2012, London Overground erected new waiting shelters and station name signs.

==Services==

The typical off-peak and peak service on the Windrush line of the London Overground is four trains per hour to Clapham Junction and four trains per hour to Dalston Junction via Shoreditch High Street, joining the East London line at Surrey Quays.

Until 8 December 2012, Clapham High Street was served by a twice-hourly Southern service between and .

From 9 December 2012, London Overground services began operating between and , completing the orbital route around London. As a result, all Southern services were withdrawn and replaced with London Overground services, with four trains calling per hour.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 50, 88, 155, 322, 345 and P5 and night route N155 serve the station.

<doc id="517735" wikidata="Q567074" url="?curid=517735" title="La Cambe German war cemetery">
<text>La Cambe is a Second World War German military war grave cemetery, located close to the American landing beach of Omaha, and north west of Bayeux in Normandy, France. It is the largest German war cemetery in Normandy and contains the remains of over 21,200 German military personnel. Initially, American and German dead were buried in adjacent fields but American dead were later disinterred and either returned to the US or re-interred at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, away. After the war over 12,000 German dead were moved from approximately 1,400 field burials across Normandy to La Cambe. The cemetery is maintained and managed by the voluntary German War Graves Commission (&quot;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&quot;).

==History==
La Cambe was originally the site of a battlefield cemetery created on 10 June 1944 by the 607th Quartermaster Graves Registration Company during the Battle of Normandy. American and German soldiers, sailors and airmen were buried in two adjacent fields.

Following the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, the American Battle Monuments Commission began exhuming the remains of American servicemen and transferring them in accordance with the wishes of their families. Beginning in 1945, the Americans transferred two-thirds of their fallen from this site back to the United States while the remainder were re-interred at the new permanent American Cemetery and Memorial at Colleville-sur-Mer, which overlooks the Omaha Beach landing site.

Due to the rapid advance of the Allies during the latter stage of the Normandy campaign, German war dead were scattered over a wide area, many of them buried in isolated field graves or small battlefield cemeteries. In the years following the war, the German War Graves Commission (&quot;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&quot;) sought to establish six main German cemeteries in the Normandy area.

==Formation==
La Cambe, as an existing site of German war dead with over 8,000 interments already informally cared for by the German War Graves Commission, was a natural choice for one of the six formal sites. After the signing in 1954 of the Franco-German Treaty on War Graves, La Cambe was formally cared for, allowing the remains of 12,000 German soldiers to be moved in from 1,400 locations in the French departments of Manche, Calvados and the Orne.

In 1954, the Franco-German War Graves Agreement ratified that the Reinterment Commission of the Volksbund could move German bodies from field graves and village cemeteries. During the removals many previously anonymous German soldiers were identified. In 1958, the youth section of the Volksbund drew people from seven nations to work on the cemetery. Layout and landscaping of the site began immediately after formal handover, with a large central tumulus (or &quot;kamaradengraben&quot;), flanked by two statues and topped by a large dark cross in basalt lava, which marks the resting place for 207 unknown and 89 identified German soldiers, interred together in a mass grave. The tumulus is surrounded by 49 rectangular grave fields with up to 400 graves each. On the large grass areas graves are identified by flat grave markers.

La Cambe was officially inaugurated as a war cemetery in September 1961 (along with the German cemeteries at Marigny, Orglandes and Saint-Désir-de-Lisieux). Special trains were organised to bring former comrades and family members to La Cambe. Since that date, the remains of more than 700 soldiers found on battlefields across Normandy have been re-interred at La Cambe.

The sign in front of the cemetery reads as follows:


==Notable graves==
The majority of the German war dead buried at La Cambe fell between June 6 (D-Day landings) and August 20, 1944 (the end of the Battle of Normandy) and their ages range from 16 to 72. Casualties of the war in Normandy are still being found after some 75 years, although formal burial ceremonies are less frequent nowadays. In total, as of July 2008, there are the remains of 21,222 German soldiers, sailors and airmen buried at La Cambe. The buried include:
*&quot;Generalmajor&quot; Sigismund-Helmut von Dawans, killed in the RAF raid on the Panzergruppe West&#x27;s GHQ.
*SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Adolf Diekmann: the most senior officer at the massacre of Oradour-sur-Glane on 10 June 1944. Ordered to be court martialled, he was killed in battle in Normandy on 29 June.
*SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Michael Wittmann: Tiger tank ace, who along with his tank crew was informally buried in an unmarked site following their deaths on 8 August 1944. Rediscovered in 1983, the crew was re-interred at La Cambe.
*&quot;Hauptmann&quot; Herbert Huppertz, fighter pilot killed on 8 June.

==Information Center==
Since the mid-1990s, there has been an Information Center on the site. It commemorates the memory of the losses of Operation Overlord, when in summer 1944 more than 100,000 people died: American, British, German, French, Canadian, Poles and members of other nations. Also at least 14,000 French civilians died. Human fates and reconciliation are special themes. Visitors can also view a permanent exhibition about the German War Graves Commission and have access to a database to locate the graves of dead German soldiers. A peace-garden with 1,200 maple-trees from gifts symbolizes that peace ought to grow.

==Volunteer maintenance==
Unlike the American and Commonwealth War Graves Commissions, the German Commission is entirely voluntary and relies on gifts and collections to further its work. During the summer months one may see international school children tending the graves. They volunteer to work with the Volksbund during their school holidays and visit American and German war cemeteries, memorials, sites of the invasion and take part in the memorial ceremony with veterans and the mayor of La Cambe.

==German cemeteries in Normandy==
There are six German war cemeteries graveyards in Normandy with La Cambe being the largest:
* Champigny-St. André (19,836)
* Mont-de-Huisnes (11,956).
* Orglandes (10,152) 
* Marigny (11,169)
* St. Désir-de-Lisieux (3,735)

<doc id="517737" wikidata="Q1506986" url="?curid=517737" title="Chrome plating">
<text>Chrome plating (less commonly chromium plating) is a technique of electroplating a thin layer of chromium onto a metal object. A chrome plated part is called &quot;chrome&quot;, or is said to have been &quot;chromed&quot;. The chromium layer can be decorative, provide corrosion resistance, facilitate cleaning, and increase surface hardness. Sometimes a less expensive substitute for chrome, such as nickel, may be used for aesthetic purposes.

Chromium compounds used in electroplating are toxic. In most countries, their disposal is tightly regulated. Some fume suppressants used to control the emission of airborne chromium from plating baths are also toxic, making disposal even more difficult.

==Process==
The preparation and chrome plating of a part typically includes some or all of these steps:
* Surface preparation
* Manual cleaning to remove dirt and surface impurities
* Removal of remaining organic contaminants using emulsion cleaning, alkaline cleaning, anodic electrocleaning, or solvent cleaning by immersion, spray, manual application, or vapor condensation
* Rinsing
* Activation or electroetching
* Rinsing (not necessary if the activation and plating steps are done in the same bath)
* Immersion in the chrome plating bath, where the part is allowed to warm to solution temperature
* Application of plating current for the required time to attain the desired thickness
* Rinsing

There are many variations to this process, depending on the type of substrate being plated. Different substrates need different etching solutions, such as hydrochloric, hydrofluoric, and sulfuric acids. Ferric chloride is also popular for the etching of nimonic alloys. Sometimes the component enters the chrome plating vat while electrically live. Sometimes the component has a conforming anode made from lead/tin or platinized titanium. A typical hard chrome vat plates at about per hour.

Some common industry specifications governing the chrome plating process are AMS 2460, AMS 2406, and MIL-STD-1501.

==Hexavalent chromium==
&quot;Hexavalent chromium plating&quot;, also known as &quot;hex-chrome&quot;, &quot;Cr6+&quot;, and &quot;chrome(VI)&quot; plating, uses chromium trioxide (CrO3, also known as chromic anhydride) as the main ingredient. Hexavalent chromium plating solution is used for both decorative and hard plating, as well as bright dipping of copper alloys, chromic acid anodizing, and chromate conversion coating.

A typical hexavalent chromium plating process is:

# Activation bath
# Chromium bath
# Rinse
# Second rinse

The activation bath is typically a tank of chromic acid with a reverse current run through it. This etches the work-piece surface and removes any scale. In some cases, the activation step is done in the chromium bath. The chromium bath is a mixture of chromium trioxide and sulfuric acid, the ratio of which varies greatly between 75:1 to 250:1 by weight. This results in an extremely acidic bath (pH 0). The temperature and current density in the bath affect the brightness and final coverage. For decorative coating the temperature ranges from , but for hard coating it ranges from . Temperature is also dependent on the current density, because a higher current density requires a higher temperature. Finally, the whole bath is agitated to keep the temperature steady and achieve a uniform deposition.

===Disadvantages===
One functional disadvantage of hexavalent chromium plating is low cathode efficiency, which results in bad throwing power. This means it leaves a non-uniform coating, with more on edges and less in inside corners and holes. To overcome this problem the part may be over-plated and ground to size, or auxiliary anodes may be used around the hard-to-plate areas. Hexavalent chromium is also considerably more toxic than trivalent chromium, rendering it a major health risk both in manufacturing and disposal if not handled with care.

==Trivalent chromium==
&quot;Trivalent chromium plating&quot;, also known as &quot;tri-chrome&quot;, &quot;Cr3+&quot;, and &quot;chrome(III)&quot; plating, uses chromium sulfate or chromium chloride as the main ingredient. Trivalent chromium plating is an alternative to hexavalent chromium in certain applications and thicknesses (e.g. decorative plating).

A trivalent chromium plating process is similar to the hexavalent chromium plating process, except for the bath chemistry and anode composition. There are three main types of trivalent chromium bath configurations:

*A chloride- or sulfate-based electrolyte bath using graphite or composite anodes, plus additives to prevent the oxidation of trivalent chromium to the anodes.
*A sulfate-based bath that uses lead anodes surrounded by boxes filled with sulfuric acid (known as shielded anodes), which keeps the trivalent chromium from oxidizing at the anodes.
*A sulfate-based bath that uses insoluble catalytic anodes, which maintains an electrode potential that prevents oxidation.

The trivalent chromium-plating process can plate the workpieces at a similar temperature, rate and hardness, as compared to hexavalent chromium. Plating thickness ranges from .

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
The functional advantages of trivalent chromium are higher cathode efficiency and better throwing power. Better throwing power means better production rates. Less energy is required because of the lower current densities required. The process is more robust than hexavalent chromium because it can withstand current interruptions.

One of the disadvantages when the process was first introduced was that decorative customers disapproved of the color differences. Companies now use additives to adjust the color. In hard coating applications, the corrosion resistance of thicker coatings is not quite as good as it is with hexavalent chromium. The cost of the chemicals is greater, but this is usually offset by greater production rates and lower overhead costs. In general, the process must be controlled more closely than in hexavalent chromium plating, especially with respect to metallic impurities. This means processes that are hard to control, such as barrel plating, are much more difficult using a trivalent chromium bath.

==Divalent chromium==
&quot;Divalent chromium plating&quot; is done from liquids comprising Cr2+ species. Such solutions were avoided prior to ca. 2020, because of air-sensitivity and hydrogen evolution from aqueous Cr2+ solutions. In the 2020s, it was discovered that chromous chloride has ca. 4.0 M solubility in water at room temperature (i.e. with H2O:Cr molar ratio around 14:1), and such liquids behave like supersaturated electrolytes with a reduced propensity toward hydrogen evolution. The best quality bright deposits are produced at relatively high current density of 20 mA/cm2.

==Types==
===Decorative===
&quot;&quot; is designed to be aesthetically pleasing and durable. Thicknesses range from , however, they are usually between . The chromium plating is usually applied over bright nickel plating. Typical base materials include steel, aluminium, plastic, copper alloys, and zinc alloys. Decorative chrome plating is also very corrosion resistant and is often used on car parts, tools and kitchen utensils.

=== Thin Dense Chrome ===
&quot;Thin dense chrome (TDC)&quot; differs from decorative chrome. While decorative chrome is applied primarily for aesthetic purposes with thin layers that provide a shiny finish, TDC, such as Armoloy, focuses on enhancing surface performance. It delivers wear resistance, corrosion protection, and hardness without adding significant thickness. TDC also avoids the microcracking associated with decorative chrome, making it ideal for industrial applications where durability and friction reduction are necessary. Thin dense chrome is commonly used in precision tools, aerospace, medical, and food processing equipment.

===Hard===

&#x27;, also known as &#x27; or &quot;&quot;, is used to reduce friction, improve durability through abrasion tolerance and wear resistance in general, minimize galling or seizing of parts, expand chemical inertness to include a broader set of conditions (such as oxidation resistance), and bulking material for worn parts to restore their original dimensions. It is very hard, measuring between 65 and 69 HRC (also based on the base metal&#x27;s hardness). Hard chrome tends to be thicker than decorative chrome, with standard thicknesses in non-salvage applications ranging from 20 to 40 μm, but it can be an order of magnitude thicker for extreme wear resistance requirements, in such cases 100 μm or thicker provides optimal results. Unfortunately, such thicknesses emphasize the limitations of the process, which are overcome by plating extra thickness then grinding down and lapping to meet requirements, or to improve the overall aesthetics of the chromed piece. Increasing plating thickness amplifies surface defects and roughness in proportional severity, because hard chrome does not have a leveling effect. Pieces that are not ideally shaped in reference to electric field geometries (nearly every piece sent in for plating, except spheres and egg shaped objects) require even thicker plating to compensate for non-uniform deposition, and much of it is wasted when grinding the piece back to desired dimensions.

Modern engineered coatings do not suffer such drawbacks, which often price hard chrome out due to labor costs alone. Hard chrome replacement technologies outperform hard chrome in wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and cost. Hardness up to 80 HRC is not extraordinary for such materials. Modern engineered coatings applied using spray deposition can form layers of uniform thickness that often require no further polishing or machining. These coatings are often composites of polymers, metals, and ceramic powders or fibers as proprietary formulas protected by patents or as trade secrets, and thus are usually known by brand names.

Hard chromium plating is subject to different types of quality requirements depending on the application; for instance, the plating on hydraulic piston rods are tested for corrosion resistance with a salt spray test.

==Automotive use==

Most bright decorative items affixed to cars are referred to as &quot;chrome&quot;, meaning steel that has undergone several plating processes to protect it from weathering and moisture but the term passed on to cover any similar-looking shiny decorative auto parts, including silver plastic trim pieces in casual terminology. Triple plating is the most expensive and durable process, which involves plating the steel first with copper and then nickel before the chromium plating is applied.

Prior to the application of chrome in the 1920s, nickel electroplating was used. In the short production run prior to the US entry into World War II, the government banned plating to save chromium and automobile manufacturers painted the decorative pieces in a complementary color. In the last years of the Korean War, the US contemplated banning chrome in favor of several cheaper processes (such as plating with zinc and then coating with shiny plastic).

In 2007, a Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) was issued banning several toxic substances for use in the automotive industry in Europe, including hexavalent chromium, which is used in chrome plating. However, chrome plating is metal and contains no hexavalent chromium after it is rinsed, so chrome plating is not banned.

==Arms use==
Chrome-lining protects the barrel or chamber of arms from corrosion and makes these parts also easier to clean, but this is not the main purpose for lining a barrel or chamber. Chrome-lining was introduced in machine guns to increase the wear resistance and service life of highly stressed arms parts like barrels and chambers, allowing more rounds to be fired before a barrel is worn and needs to be replaced. The end of the chamber, freebore and leade (the unrifled portion of the barrel just forward of the chamber), as well as the first few centimeters or few inches of rifling, in rifles are subject to very high temperatures—as the energy content of rifle propellants can exceed 3500 kJ/kg—and pressures that can exceed . The propellant gases act similarly as the flame from a cutting torch, the gases heating up the metal to red-hot state and the velocity tearing away metal. Under slow fire conditions, the affected areas are able to cool sufficiently in between shots. Under sustained rapid fire or automatic/cyclic fire there is no time for the heat to dissipate. The heat and pressure effects exerted by the hot propellant gasses and friction by the projectile can quickly cause damage by washing away metal at the end of the chamber, freebore, leade and rifling. Hard chrome-lining protects the chamber, freebore, leade and rifling with a thin coat of wear resistant chrome. This significantly extends barrel life in arms that are fired for prolonged periods in full-auto or sustained rapid fire modes. Some arms manufacturers use Stellite-lining alloy as an alternative to hard chrome-lining to further increase the wear resistance and service life of highly stressed arms parts.

==Health and environmental concerns==
Hexavalent chromium is the most toxic form of chromium. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency regulates it heavily. The EPA lists hexavalent chromium as a hazardous air pollutant because it is a human carcinogen, a &quot;priority pollutant&quot; under the Clean Water Act, and a &quot;hazardous constituent&quot; under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Due to its low cathodic efficiency and high solution viscosity, a toxic mist of water and hexavalent chromium is released from the bath. Wet scrubbers are used to control these emissions. The liquid from the wet scrubbers is treated to precipitate the chromium and remove it from the wastewater before it is discharged.

Additional toxic waste created from hexavalent chromium baths include lead chromates, which form in the bath because lead anodes are used. Barium is also used to control the sulfate concentration, which leads to the formation of barium sulfate (BaSO4).

Trivalent chromium is intrinsically less toxic than hexavalent chromium. Because of the lower toxicity it is not regulated as strictly, which reduces overhead costs. Other health advantages include higher cathode efficiencies, which lead to less chromium air emissions; lower concentration levels, resulting in less chromium waste and anodes that do not decompose.

Maintaining a bath surface tension less than 35 dyn/cm is necessary to prevent plating solution from becoming airborne when bubbles rise to the surface and pop. This requires a frequent cycle of treating the bath with a wetting agent fume suppressant and confirming the effect on surface tension. Usually, surface tension is measured with a stalagmometer or tensiometer. This method is, however, tedious and suffers from inaccuracy (errors up to 22 dyn/cm have been reported), and is dependent on the user&#x27;s experience and capabilities.

While they are effective for the control of toxic airborne chromium, many widely used wetting agent fume suppressants are toxic themselves because they contain perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are hazardous chemicals that can cause long-term health effects. This makes electroplating one of the jobs with the highest risk of occupational exposure to PFAS, but not as high as firefighters using fluorinated aqueous film forming foams. In addition to their detrimental effects on human health, PFAS are persistent pollutants that cause significant bioaccumulation and biomagnification, putting animals at the highest trophic level at the highest risk for toxic effects.
==Mechanism of chromium electroplating==
It has been known for over a century, that chromium electroplating is relatively easy from (di)chromate solutions, but difficult from Cr3+ solutions. Several theories have been proposed to explain this finding.

An earlier view suggested, that an active Cr3+ species (perhaps, with a ligand rather than water) forms initially from electroreduced Cr6+. This active Cr3+ species can be reduced into metallic chromium relatively easy. However, the &quot;active Cr3+&quot; also undergoes within less than 1 second a transition into &quot;inactive Cr3+&quot;, which is believed to be a polymeric hexa-aqua complex. Some complexes of Cr3+ with ligand other than water can undergo relatively fast electroreduction to metallic chromium, and they are used in chromate-free chromium plating methods.

A different school of thought suggests, that the main problem with chromium plating from Cr3+ solution is hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the role of chromate is to scavenge H+ ions in a reaction that competes with H2 evolution:

The shine of plated chrome depends on whether microscopic cracks in the plating are visible on the surface. The dull appearance of some chrome layers is due to continuous cracks that propagate through the whole plated metal layer, while bright deposits appear in the case of small microcracks that are confined to inner depth of the deposit. This HER side-reaction mechanism seems more acceptable by the electrochemistry community at present. Methods of plating chromium from Cr3+ solutions that rely on reversed current pulses have been commercialized (allegedly, to reoxidize the H2).

<text>Cambremer () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. Cambremer is located in the heart of the Pays d&#x27;Auge, between Lisieux and Caen.
The village is twinned with Witheridge, UK, and the two villages have annual exchange trips (although not solely for students).

==Etymology==
The exact etymology of the name of the town is unknown. The village is mentioned, however, from the seventh century under the Latinized form of Cambrimaro.

The second element is probably the Germanic meaning &quot;lake&quot; or &quot;pond&quot; (see Old English meri: lake, pond, now in place names -Mère). Common in the north of France (see Mortemer).

==History==
In 1973, the former communes of Grandouet, Saint-Aubin-sur-Algot and Saint-Pair-du-Mont were incorporated in Cambremer. On 1 January 2019, the former commune of Saint-Laurent-du-Mont was merged into Cambremer.

==Heraldry==
The arms of the town of Cambremer are: Gules the two-headed eagle displayed gold.

<doc id="517756" wikidata="Q5474214" url="?curid=517756" title="Foulness Island">
<text>Foulness Island () is a closed island on the east coast of Essex in England, which is separated from the mainland by narrow creeks. In the 2001 census, the usually resident population of the civil parish was 212, living in the settlements of Churchend and Courtsend, at the north end of the island. The population reduced to 151 at the 2011 Census. The island had until recently a general store and post office. The George and Dragon pub in Churchend closed in 2007, while the church of St Mary the Virgin closed in May 2010. In 2019, the &quot;Southend Echo&quot; reported plans for the church to be converted into a five-bedroom home.

Foulness Island is predominantly farmland and is protected from the sea by a sea wall. The island&#x27;s unusual name is derived from the Old English &quot;fugla næsse&quot; (&quot;bird headland&quot;), referring to wildfowl. It is an internationally important site for migrating and breeding birds, including pied avocets. During the North Sea flood of 1953, almost the entire island was flooded and two people died.

Before 1922, when the military road was built, the only access was across the Maplin Sands via the Broomway, a tidal path said to predate the Romans, or by boat. Public rights of way exist, but the island is now run by QinetiQ on behalf of the Ministry of Defence as MoD Shoeburyness with access to the island by non-residents subject to stringent times and restrictions.

==Governance==
Foulness is part of the electoral ward called Foulness and Great Wakering. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 5,738.

==Geography==

The island covers bounded by its sea walls. Before 1847, tithes were payable in kind, but under the terms of the Tithe Act 1836, these were replaced by payments of money. The commutation commission, who were responsible for setting the level of payments, produced a details schedule and map in 1847, which provides a detailed land usage survey. At the time, the island included of saltings, outside the sea wall. The inside the wall comprised of arable land, with pasture covering another . were described as inland water, which was made up of ponds and drainage ditches, while buildings, roads, the sea walls, and some waste ground made up the remaining . The arable land was used to grow cereal crops, namely wheat, oats and barley, and beans, white mustard and clover.

Cheap imports of wheat from America caused widespread depression among agricultural communities in the 1870s, with much arable land reverting to rough pasture. However, a map attached to the report of the Royal Commission on Agriculture (Essex), which reported in 1894, shows that no land on the island reverted to pasture up to 1880, despite some 25% reverting in the neighbouring Rochford hundred. Great Burwood Farm had of its in use as pasture in 1858, which had dropped to just in 1899. Land prices in the same period dropped dramatically, as the farm was bought for £11,165 in 1858 and sold for only £1,800 in 1899, losing 84% of its value. By the 1970s, the smaller farms had amalgamated into five large farming businesses.

==Sea defences==
The surface of the island, and much of South East England, has been sinking relative to normal tide levels since the end of the last Ice Age. There is no evidence for sea defences in the period of Roman occupation, although the area was flooded in AD 31 by an exceptional tide, which forced a withdrawal to Shoeburyness. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; also records an exceptional tide on 11 November 1099 which flooded the land, but these were rare occurrences. The first defences were probably erected in the late 12th century. By 1210, the &quot;law of the marsh&quot; was in effect: it required that the cost of such defences should be paid for by those who benefited from them, in proportion to the amount of land owned or rented, and this remained the case until the Land Drainage Act 1930. In 1335, 1338 and 1346, commissioners were sent to inspect the state of the banks in the Rochford hundred, which included Foulness.

The earliest record of sea walls is from 1271, and in 1348 there were problems with one of the marshes, which was flooding every day, indicating that it was below the level of normal tides. The sea walls were made of earth, and were thatched with hurdles of brushwood and rushes. The island was divided into 11 or 12 marshes, each with its own wall, rather than one wall around the whole area, and was extended in 1420 by a new wall around New Wick Marsh, and again between 1424 and 1486, when Arundel Marsh was enclosed. Ditches ran between the walls of the marshes, with sluices at the ends where the ditches met the sea. At high water, the island would effectively be divided into a number of smaller islands. A Commission of Sewers was appointed in 1695, whose jurisdiction included Foulness, but the inhabitants were not happy, and engaged the lawyer Sir John Brodrick to put their case. They argued that an exceptional high tide had flooded the island in 1690, but that they had repaired and improved the walls themselves, and therefore should not be taxed by the Commissioners. Eventually, Foulness had its own Commission, from 1800 to the early 1900s.

The size of the island has been increased several times by &quot;innings&quot;. Saltings build up along the shore from silt which is carried to the sea by the rivers, and is deposited on the shore by the tide. Salt-loving plants then take root in the mud, and the salting is established. The plants trap sediments, and the surface rises until it remains above the level of most tides. Inning occurs when a sea wall is built around the edge of the salting, after which rain washes the salt downwards. The alluvium which forms the soil is highly fertile once freshwater plants start to grow. The inning of New Wick Marsh added , and Arundel March covered . No new innings took place in the 1500s, as there were several exceptional tides, and activity was centred on maintaining the existing defences, but another was added between 1620 and 1662, and there was further activity between 1687 and 1688, in 1801, and finally in 1833. In total, were added to the island.

==Development==
The Broomway provided the main access to Foulness for centuries. It is an ancient track, which starts at Wakering Stairs, and runs for along the Maplin Sands, some from the present shoreline. The seaward side of the track was defined by bunches of twigs and sticks, shaped like upside-down besom brooms or fire-brooms, which are buried in the sands. Six headways run from the track to the shore, giving access to local farms. The track was extremely dangerous in misty weather, as the incoming tide floods across the sands at high speed, and the water forms whirlpools because of flows from the River Crouch and River Roach. Under such conditions, the direction of the shore cannot be determined, and the parish registers record the burials of many people who were drowned.

The island was also served by ferries, which carried fresh water as well as people. The carriage of water is mentioned in the accounts kept by the bailiffs in 1420, 1424 and 1486. By the middle of the 19th century, ferries ran to Burnham-on-Crouch, Potton Island and Wallasea Island. There was initially no source of fresh water on the island apart from any rainwater that could be collected. In 1725, it was thought that there might be water below the island, and a well was constructed on Great Shelford Marsh. It reached a depth of , but no water was found. At the end of the 1700s, Francis Bannester, who owned Rushley Island nearby, attempted to find water by boring, but again failed to do so. However, his son, also called Francis, persisted and found fresh water some below Rushley in 1828. Just six years later, there were more than 20 such springs scattered through the six islands of which Foulness is one, and fourteen farms on the island had their own wells by 1889.
Evidence for housing comes from the census returns. In 1801, 396 people lived in 43 houses, which gives an average occupancy of 9.2 people. This had increased to 9.8 in 1811, when 450 people occupied 46 houses. Ownership of the manor was inherited by George Finch in 1826, who took his responsibilities seriously, and set about improving the island by building brick houses for his tenants. Five years later, 630 people lived in 78 houses, and by 1851, 109 dwellings housed 640 people, with average occupancy down to 5.9 people. Population peaked at 754 in the census of 1871, but has steadily declined since.

=== Military use ===

From 1855, the Shoebury Sands, which are a continuation of the Maplin Sands to the south of the island, had been used as an artillery testing site, and the War Office sought to extend this at the end of the 19th century, by buying the island and its offshore sands, to act as a research and development centre for new weapons. They bought some of the sands above Fisherman&#x27;s Head in 1900, but the rest belonged to Alan Finch, the Lord of the Manor, and he refused to grant shooting rights over them. In 1912, the War Office also discovered that large areas of the sands were leased to tenants, who used them for fishing with s. A kiddle was a large V-shaped or square wicker trap, which formed an enclosure in which fish were trapped as the tide receded.

=== Military takeover ===

Attempts to buy the lordship were also refused by Finch, but he died in 1914, and his half-brother Wilfred Henry Montgomery Finch sold it on 13 July 1915, resulting in the War Office owning around two-thirds of the island. They had also been buying any farms that were not part of the manor, and by the end of the First World War the only buildings which they did not own were the church and rectory, the school, and a mission hall at Courts End. They demolished the post mill towards the beginning of the war, and the parish poor-house and a wooden lock-up which was located near the church were also demolished.

One benefit of the takeover was the construction of the military road in 1922, which crosses New England Island and Havengore Island by a series of bridges, to reach the mainland near Great Wakering. After its opening, the Broomway ceased to be used, except by the military. With the passing of the Ministry of Defence Act 1946 and the subsequent rationalisation of five agencies in 1971, ownership of the island passed from the War Office to the Ministry of Defence. In 2003, a contract to manage the testing of munitions was awarded to the defence contractors QinetiQ, and they also control access to the island.

==Proposals==
In the 1850s, the South Essex Estuary and Reclamation Company proposed a grand scheme to reclaim around of land on the Essex coast, which would have included most of Foulness Sands and Maplin Sands. The civil engineer Sir John Rennie produced the plans, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1852. This authorised the construction of a wall, running from Wakering Stairs to beyond Foulness Point. A small amount of work was carried out on another part of the scheme near Bradwell-on-Sea, but the company was wound up in 1868. Lack of finance and opposition from landowners contributed to its failure.

Another scheme was proposed by William Napier and William Hope in January 1862, in response to requests from the Metropolitan Board for imaginative ways to generate a profit from the large quantities of sewage which had been conveyed away from London by Joseph Bazalgette&#x27;s sewer system. Hope had experience of reclamation and irrigation works in Spain and Majorca. Their scheme envisaged a culvert from the northern outfall to Rawreth, where a northern branch would convey sewage to Dengie Flats, and a southern one to Maplin Sands. Some would be reclaimed on both sides of the River Crouch, which would become prime agricultural land. Among several schemes, it was the only one which came with detailed plans, and was accepted by the Board, despite opposition from the City of London, who argued that the soil on Maplin Sands was unsuitable for irrigation with sewage.

The estimated cost of the scheme was £2.1 million, with pumping costs of between £10,000 and £13,000 per year. The Metropolitan Sewage and Essex Reclamation Company was set up, and deposited £25,000 with the Board, to be refunded on completion. Construction work began in late 1865, and the Board remained confident that the scheme would be completed, but the collapse of the Overend Gurney bank precipitated a crisis in the City of London, which made it difficult to raise the finance. A report by the Board for 1867-8 stated that no progress had been made for some time, and all reference to the scheme had ceased by 1871. The board kept the £25,000, the only money that the London ratepayers ever received for their sewage, despite claims at the time that it was worth over £4 million.

Around 100 years later, the Roskill Commission investigated potential sites for a third London airport. Four sites were considered, including construction of an off-shore airport on Maplin Sands. The Commission chose a site at Cublington but the UK government rejected the commission&#x27;s proposal and accepted a dissenting report recommending that a new airport should be developed at Foulness. The Maplin Development Act received royal assent in October 1973. In 1973 a Special Development Order was made under the Town and Country Planning Act granting planning permission for the project, and the Maplin Development Authority was constituted and began its work. The project would have included not just a major airport, but a deep-water harbour suitable for the container ships then starting to revolutionise maritime transport, a high-speed rail link together with the M12 and M13 motorways to London, and a new town for the accommodation of the thousands of workers who would be required. The new town was to cover 82 square miles, with a population of 600,000 people. The cost was to be a then-astronomical £825 million (£ in 2025), which many regarded as unacceptable. The Maplin project was abandoned in July 1974 when Labour came to power in the shadow of the 1973 oil crisis.

==1953 flood==
Most of the island was flooded in 1953, as a result of exceptional weather conditions which affected much of the Netherlands and the east coast of England. High water at Southend was expected to be above mean sea level at 1:30 am on Sunday 1 February. The actual tide rose to above mean sea level, which was above the danger level for this part of the Essex coast. This level in itself was not a danger to the island, as the sea walls had been raised and strengthened between 1951 and 1952 by the War Office, and were above mean sea level. However, the high water was accompanied by strong winds, creating large waves, which broke over the top of the defences, washing away the earth banks on the inland side of the walls. Two sections of the wall breached, from Rugwood Head to Asplin&#x27;s Head on the eastern side of the island, and for about to the west of Foulness Point on the northern side of the island. By 6:00 am, most of it was under water, and gas, electricity and telephone links had been severed. Rescue attempts on the Sunday failed to reach Foulness.

Plans were formulated by the army, the Southend lifeboat service and various civilian services for a rescue attempt on the Monday. Great Wakering village hall and the Royal Corinthian Yacht Club at Burnham-on-Crouch were prepared as reception centres, and a flotilla of small boats, the lifeboat, a barge and an army DUKW amphibious truck reached the stranded people and evacuated them to the reception centres. 30 men refused to leave, because of the plight of their livestock, but 24 of them were compulsorily evacuated the following day. Two people died in the disaster. Rescue of the animals was difficult, because the road was not accessible, and all access to the island was across the sands, using the Broomway to Fisherman&#x27;s Head, which was only possible at low tide. On Wednesday 4 February, a number of DUKWs and four-wheel-drive lorries reached the island with food and water for the stranded animals, which were rounded up and assembled at the churchyard, where the land is slightly higher. The following day, they were moved to Newhouse Farm, near Fisherman&#x27;s Head, ready for the arrival of 24 cattle lorries, which drove across the sands early on Friday morning. Most of the animals had been rescued by Saturday night, with the final sixteen dairy cows leaving by barge on Sunday morning. 400 cattle, 14 calves, 28 horses, 72 sheep, 6 lambs, 3 pigs, 670 chickens, 100 ducks, 2 dogs, 10 rabbits, 4 budgerigars and the 16 dairy cows were rescued. Around 700 sheep and 249 pigs were drowned.

In order to repair the walls before the next spring tides, which were due on 16 February 300 soldiers and 70 sailors were drafted in. Three Royal Navy minesweepers, the &quot;Cheerful&quot;, &quot;Cockatrice&quot; and &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, were moored near Foulness Point, and were used as accommodation by the workers. The number of personnel had increased to 400 soldiers and 100 sailors by 11 February. High tide on 14 February was higher than expected, and washed away a section of the repaired wall at Shelford Creek, but repairs were again made, and the walls survived the spring tides of the following two days. Re-occupation of the island was delayed until 19 March, to ensure that the new walls would withstand the spring tides due on 14 and 15 March, but many people commuted to their homes each day to begin the task of cleaning up the mess. Of the 114 families who had been evacuated, 80 returned on 19 March.

==Conservation==

The island&#x27;s name is derived from the Old English &quot;fugla-næss&quot;, with &quot;fugla&quot; (modern &quot;fowl&quot;) meaning &quot;of birds&quot; and &quot;&quot; being the Germanic word for promontory, and it remains an important centre for birds, with the area around Foulness Point designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Habitat is provided by extensive mud flats and sand flats, which are covered twice a day by the tides, together with salt marshes, banks of shingle and shells, grazing marshes, rough grass and scrubland. They are recognised as being internationally important for six species of birds. Thousands of dark-bellied brent geese arrive from Russia to spend the winter on the flats, which are also frequented by bar-tailed godwit, grey plover, red knot, oystercatcher and redshank. For curlew, dunlin and shelduck, the site is of national importance. In winter, hen harriers can be seen foraging, and a wide range of plants and invertebrates thrive there.

Other birds which use the island for breeding include avocet, common tern, little tern, Sandwich tern and ringed plover. During the winter months, in excess of 100,000 waterfowl have been reported. The avocet population is the second largest in the United Kingdom. The Foulness SSSI has been designated as a Special Protection Area for Birds under the EC Birds Directive, and is also a Ramsar site under the Ramsar Convention because of its importance as a wetland.

== Foulness Heritage Centre ==
The island&#x27;s heritage centre was established in 2002 in the old primary school at Churchend. The conversion was made possible following an ‘Awards for All’ grant, funding from QinetiQ and a donation the ‘Bishop of Bradwell’s Fund’. It opened to the public in February 2003. It is run by volunteers from the Foulness Conservation and Archaeological Society and acts as a museum with displays of archaeological artefacts and memorabilia as well as documents and photographs. In 2003 it was a runner up in the annual MOD award for the best conservation projects across the entire defence estate, the Sanctuary Award. It closed to visitors during the winter of 2005/6 for a reorganisation of its displays to include newly donated items. It is open to visitors on the afternoon of the first Sunday of each month from April to October.

<text>Peter Leo Van Loan, (born April 18, 1963) is a former Canadian politician who served as the Member of Parliament for the electoral district of York—Simcoe from 2004 to 2018. He was the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons from 2007 to 2008 and again from 2011 to 2015.

==Biography==

Born in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Van Loan is of Estonian heritage on his maternal side. His mother and grandparents fled Estonia during World War II and immigrated to Canada.

Van Loan was educated at the University of Toronto and York University and holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree, a Masters in International Relations and an additional master&#x27;s degree in geography. Van Loan graduated from York University&#x27;s Osgoode Hall Law School and was admitted to the Bar of Ontario in 1989.

Prior to his election to public office, Van Loan was a partner and Chair of the Planning and Development Law Group at the law firm of Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP in Toronto, Ontario. Van Loan was also an adjunct professor of planning at the University of Toronto. He served as president of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario during Mike Harris&#x27; term of office and then of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada for a brief period. He resigned from the latter post in 2000 after a series of disagreements with its leader, Joe Clark.

Van Loan was a key figure in the unsuccessful attempt to convince Premier of New Brunswick Bernard Lord to run for the leadership of the federal Progressive Conservatives in late 2002. He was a key organizer in the &quot;Yes&quot; Campaign, led by Tory Leader Peter MacKay, to ratify the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance into the Conservative Party of Canada. Van Loan then again attempted to recruit Lord to run for the leadership of the new party, and again was unsuccessful.

In an article from January 24, 2008, Van Loan was classified as one of &quot;Harper&#x27;s 12&quot;, the twelve most influential people in Ottawa, by &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Other cabinet ministers included were Jim Prentice, John Baird, and Jim Flaherty.

On October 30, 2008, Jay Hill replaced Van Loan as Government House Leader and Steven John Fletcher took over the Minister for Democratic Reform post. Van Loan became the Minister for Public Safety, as Stockwell Day became the Minister of International Trade. On these changes Don Martin wrote: &quot;The House of Commons might become a slightly friendlier place now that Peter Van Loan has lost the job of Question Period cheap shot specialist to become Public Safety Minister, a good move that seems to back Harper’s pledge to play nice with others during the upcoming session.&quot;

On January 19, 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper designated Van Loan as the next Minister of International Trade.

On December 5, 2012, on the floor of the House of Commons Van Loan was involved in an altercation with NDP Leader Tom Mulcair. Van Loan crossed the aisle and used an inappropriate word during the confrontation. He was restrained by Defence Minister Peter MacKay.

Van Loan was one of thirteen Canadians banned from travelling to Russia under retaliatory sanctions imposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2014. In response to the ban, Van Loan said that the ban was &quot;not of serious consequence&quot; and that he would &quot;not be losing sleep over being on the list.&quot;

On July 29, 2018, Van Loan announced that he would be retiring from politics. He retired from the House of Commons on September 30. In the by-election, his seat was held for the Conservatives by candidate Scot Davidson.

<text>The Serie B (), officially known as Serie [[Balkrishna Industries|BKT]] for sponsorship reasons, is the second-highest division in the Italian football league system after the Serie A. It has been operating for over ninety years since the 1929–30 season. It had been organized by Lega Calcio until 2010 and the Lega B ever since. Common nicknames for the league are &quot;campionato cadetto&quot; and &quot;cadetteria&quot;, since &quot;cadetto&quot; is the Italian name for junior or cadet.

==History==
The first Italian football championships were composed of a small number of teams. It was in 1904 that the tournament expanded with the first edition of the Seconda Categoria (&quot;Second Category&quot;): this was a competition in which, on one side, the reserve teams of clubs affiliated with the Prima Categoria (&quot;First Category&quot;) participated, and on the other side, those provincial clubs that had recently joined the Italian Football Federation (FIGC).

For the provincial teams, it wasn&#x27;t enough to beat the reserve teams of the metropolitan clubs by winning the second-tier championship: they had to prove to a Federal Technical Commission that they had acquired a sufficient level of technical ability to compete with the first-team players of the Prima Categoria. Therefore, they were required to demonstrate this in a unique test match, not comparable to a play-off, a match against a Prima Categoria team in front of prominent football figures of the time. The first team to reach the honour, was Pro Vercelli in 1907, which even won the scudetto in 1908.

The status quo was challenged by a federal official with a letter published in the football columns of La Gazzetta dello Sport in February 1912: according to him, there was no movement between the Prima Categoria and the Seconda Categoria, which had to bear the expenses of an entire season only to see them wasted by a single match against the reserve teams of the larger clubs. The official proposed the introduction of a promotion-relegation system, which immediately gained the support of many clubs. As a result, several proposals for changes to the current Championship Regulations were drawn up in preparation for the annual Federal Assembly. This mechanism was introduced by the Federal Assembly on August 31, 1912, where the Valvassori-Faroppa plan was approved. This plan modified the Italian football pyramid, turning the Seconda Categoria into the new Promozione (&quot;Promotion&quot;) championship and creating a dedicated championship for Reserve teams. Just as the Seconda Categoria had been managed in the past, the Promozione was entrusted to the Regional Committees, which the FIGC had established in 1909.

It wasn’t until 1921 that the Pozzo Plan, made by manager Vittorio Pozzo, created a true national second-tier league by establishing the Seconda Divisione (&quot;Second Division&quot;), a tournament in which all the clubs affected by the heavy trimming of the Prima Categoria, now renamed Prima Divisione (&quot;First Division&quot;), participated. The new introduced regulations, strongly supported by the secessionist Italian Football Confederation (CCI) (which applied them starting in the 1921–22 season) and approved along with the Pozzo Plan, involved the division of Italy into two large geographical areas, managed by the North and South Leagues, with a sharp cut at the center of the country. This meant teams from Tuscany played in the North, and those from Marche and Umbria played in the South. As a result, the Seconda Divisione experienced two different sets of rules, due to the stark geographical and organizational differences: in the North, the league was organized outside the regional framework directly by the Lega Nord, while in the South, it was still managed by the Regional Committees because the distances and means of transportation didn’t allow for interregional league management. Only in the 1925–26 season did the Lega Sud of major clubs organized the regional Seconda Divisione groups directly. The first teams to be relegated (1921-22 season) were Vicenza and Inter Milan even if, after the CCI reunion with FIGC, the regulations were changed, and Venezia was demoted instead of the Milanese club. 

In the north, the new competition started in the 1922–23 season with 48 teams divided into six groups, structured at the interregional level but still vaguely corresponding to the jurisdictions of the regional committees. By 1924–25, the number dropped to 40 teams and four groups, now geographically more extensive. In the south, not all Regional Committees managed to organize the Seconda Divisione championship immediately, which was especially difficult in the island regions, where the number of regulation-sized fields was minimal. The first season saw about 25 teams participating, and by the following season, this increased to 40, but problems related to the particularly troubled political era began to emerge. Few clubs managed to complete all four championships organized by the Lega Sud between 1922–23 and 1925–26 due to high operating costs.

In 1926, the Viareggio Charter renamed the top league to Divisione Nazionale (&quot;National Division&quot;), consequently renaming the lower categories, with the Seconda Divisione becoming the Prima Divisione. The two bodies managing the tournament, the Lega Nord and Lega Sud, were merged into a national governing body called the Direttorio Divisioni Superiori (&quot;Directory of Higher Divisions&quot;). This led to one of the groups being reserved for southern clubs, with many northern teams effectively relegated by default.

The far-reaching reform envisioned by the Viareggio Charter was completed in 1928 by the new FIGC president, the fascist politician from Bologna, Leandro Arpinati. The influential politician established the creation of a radically different second-tier league within a year, meaning no longer an interregional tournament but a single national group, exactly like the one planned for the top league. Thus, in 1929, the Serie B of the Divisione Nazionale was born. The establishment of a single group for the second-tier league sparked protests from smaller clubs, who complained about the high travel costs for matches across the entire country and the lower gate receipts compared to the top league. They unsuccessfully proposed expanding the first edition of Serie B of the Divisione Nazionale to two groups based on territorial criteria, admitting the semifinalists of the southern Prima Divisione championship by default. The two-group formula would have reduced the high operating costs of participating in the second-tier league and given more representation to the central and southern teams. However, the proposal was not accepted, and Serie B remained a single group.

The first edition saw 18 teams registered, a format that remained unchanged until the 1933–34 season, when an attempt was made to divide into two groups based on geography (west and east). However, this experiment was unsuccessful, and in 1935–36, the original model was reinstated, which, except for an attempt to reduce the number of teams between 1936 and 1938, continued until the break caused by World War II.

In the immediate post-war years, the colossal wartime destruction and widespread poverty made it impossible to immediately restart the competition. The tournament developed with different formats between the two areas of the country, north and south. In the 1946–47 and 1947–48 seasons, the Serie B was played with a three-group format (geographically divided into northwest, northeast, and central-south). In the 1948–49 season, the FIGC finally managed to recreate a single group with 22 teams, reduced again to 18 teams in the 1952–53 season. In the 1958–59 season, the league was expanded to 20 teams, a format that, except for one occasion (the 1967–68 season, with 21 teams due to the reduction from 18 to 16 Serie A teams), remained unchanged for 35 years. 

It was the consequences of the so-called &quot;Caso Catania&quot; in the 2003–04 season that disrupted this consolidated tradition and brought the number of participating teams to a record high of 24, later reduced to 22 the following year. 

From 1946, both Serie A and Serie B were ran by Lega Calcio. However, on 30 April 2009, after divisions between Serie A and Serie B clubs regarding the future of the league, 19 of 20 top-flight clubs (the only exception being Lecce) agreed on plans to split from Serie B to form another governing and financing body. Subsequently, on 1 July 2010, the Lega Calcio has officially ceased to exist and was replaced by the two newly formed leagues, Lega Serie A and Lega Serie B.

In the 2018–19 season, due to the bankruptcy of Avellino, Bari, and Cesena to register, and the inability to quickly relegate teams (by the deadline for presenting the 2018–19 season fixtures), the second-tier league once again had an odd number of teams, dropping from 22 to 19. By FIGC order, in the 2019–20 season, the league returned to having 20 teams, a format that had been in place from 1968 to 2003.

The second-tier league, following the example of the top division, introduced the VAR system: from 2018 to 2021, it was used only for the play-offs and play-outs, while starting from the 2021–22 season, it was implemented for the entire regular season.

Serie B is the lowest division in which five historic clubs have ever played: Torino, Juventus, Milan, Roma and Lazio.

==Competition format==

=== League ===
The single group format established in the 1929–30 season is identical to the Serie A (the immediately higher category): a round-robin group with home and away matches between the twenty participating teams for 38 games. Three points are awarded to the winner of the match, one point each for a draw, and no points for the losing team. The regulations provide for three promotions to the top tier, against four relegations to Serie C. The top two teams are automatically promoted; the last promotion is instead decided through the playoffs, in which teams ranked from 3rd to 8th place participate, unless there is a gap of more than 14 points between the 3rd and 4th place teams: in this case, the playoffs will not be played, and the 3rd place team will be promoted directly to Serie A. Conversely, the teams ranked 18th to 20th are directly relegated; the last relegation is decided by a play-out between the 16th and 17th placed teams, unless the 17th place is more than 5 points behind the 16th place: in this case, the play-out will not be played, and the 17th place team will be directly relegated to Serie C. Starting from the 2005-06 season, the &quot;head-to-head&quot; ranking is used to determine the final classification in the event of a tie.

Since the 2006–07 season, Serie B introduced an on-field award ceremony for the first-place team, which is presented with a dedicated trophy. Until the 2019–20 season, the winning team of the tournament received the &quot;Ali della Vittoria&quot; (Wings of Victory) cup. After an interim season, starting from the 2021–22 season, the new &quot;Nexus Cup&quot; was introduced; a smaller version of this cup is also awarded to the second-place team and the winner of the playoffs.

Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history;
* 18 clubs: 1929–1933
* 26 clubs (in two groups): 1933–1934
* 32 clubs (in two groups): 1934–1935
* 18 clubs: 1935–1936
* 16 clubs: 1936–1937
* 17 clubs: 1937–1938
* 18 clubs: 1938–1943
* 60 clubs (in three groups): 1946–1947
* 54 clubs (in three groups): 1947–1948
* 22 clubs: 1948–1950
* 21 clubs: 1950–1951
* 22 clubs: 1951–1952
* 18 clubs: 1952–1958
* 20 clubs: 1958–1967
* 21 clubs: 1967–1968
* 20 clubs: 1968–2003
* 24 clubs: 2003–2004
* 22 clubs: 2004–2018
* 19 clubs: 2018–2019
* 20 clubs: 2019–present

=== Promotion and relegation ===

==== Play-offs ====
Play-offs were introduced in Serie B in the 2004–05 season to determine the third team promoted to Serie A.

The original formula provided for the participation of four teams (from 3rd to 6th place) who faced each other in semifinals and finals (both based on home and away matches). If the gap between the 3rd and 4th place teams was greater than nine points, the third-place team would be directly promoted to Serie A; otherwise, the play-offs would take place. In the 2012–13 season, there was a change in the final regulation: extra time was abolished in the away leg if the score was tied after 180 minutes.

In the 2013–2014 season, the play-off bracket was expanded to include a maximum of six teams (from 3rd to 8th place), which had to be within a fourteen-point margin. As a result, the number of clubs participating in the promotion play-offs could vary, and thus the structure of the tournament changed depending on how many teams were involved. The third-place team would still be directly promoted if it had a gap of more than 9 points from the fourth place.

From the 2017–2018 season onwards, the play-offs involve teams ranked from 3rd to 8th place (without considering the gap between them), but the point difference between the 3rd and 4th place teams must not exceed fourteen points (instead of nine). The format is no longer variable based on the number of participating teams.

The current format is as follows:

* The teams ranked from 5th to 8th place enter the preliminary round: 5th place faces 8th, and 6th faces 7th. There is only one match at the home of the higher-ranked team at the end of the season, and in case of a draw, extra time is played. If still tied after 120 minutes, the higher-ranked team in the regular season advances to the semifinals.

* The teams ranked 3rd and 4th place automatically advance to the semifinals, along with the 2 winners from the preliminary round. The 3rd place team faces the winner of the match between 6th and 7th place from the preliminary round. Semifinal matches are played home and away, and in case of a tie after 90 minutes in the return leg, the team better placed in the regular season advances to the final.

* The final consists of one home and one away match. If there is an overall tie after 180 minutes, the team better placed in the regular season is promoted to Serie A. Only if both teams finished the season with the same number of points, starting from the 2015–2016 season, extra time and possibly penalty kicks are played. In both the semifinals and the final, the away goals rule is not applied.

==== Play-out ====
Play-outs were introduced in the 2003–04 season to determine the fourth team relegated to Serie C: the bottom three teams are directly relegated, followed by the fourth-to-last team if the gap from the fifth-to-last team exceeds four points (5 points in the 2003–04 season). Otherwise, the play-out takes place with a home and away match: in the event of a draw in the final score, the fifth-to-last placed team at the end of the season retains its place in Serie B. Only if the two teams have finished the season with the same points in the standings, starting from the 2015–16 season, the away match includes extra time and possibly penalty kicks. Just like in the play-offs, the away goals rule does not apply in the play-out.

==Top scorers==
==Awards==
== Sponsorships ==
From the 1998–99 season to the 2009–10 season, Serie B used its first commercial name, Serie B TIM, following a sponsorship agreement with TIM, an Italian telecommunications company, which involved all the competitions organized by Lega Calcio. 

Starting from the 2010–11 season, following the division within the Lega Calcio and the creation of the new Lega Serie B, the second tier of Italian football began managing its own search for title sponsors. The league adopted various commercial names, including: Serie bwin (2010–2013), Serie B Eurobet (2013–2014), Serie B ConTe.it (2015–2018), Serie BKT (since 2018). In the 2014–15 season, the play-off and play-out rounds received an additional sponsor: Compass, which led to the names Playoff Compass and Playout Compass for those phases of the competition.

Furthermore, in the 2013–2014 season, Serie B introduced a single top sponsor for all teams participating in the league, which appeared on the back of the players&#x27; jerseys for the first time. This sponsorship was repeated in the 2014–15 and 2018–19 seasons.

<text>Charitas is one of the 48 neighborhoods in which the city of Niterói, in Brazil is divided.

The area was part of the Jesuitic Sesmaria, where the Jesuits built a cemetery and a church consecrated to Saint Francis Xavier. The name of the neighborhood derives from the Latin word &quot;caritas&quot;, meaning charity, which is inscribed on the church&#x27;s door.

In the 18th century, a landowner donated to the Saint Joseph Seminar, in Rio de Janeiro, the piece of land that came to be the Jurujuba Farm and upon which a mansion, known as &quot;Casarão&quot; (big house) was built.

In 1853, the Saint Isabel Naval Hospital was opened and originally run by the sanitarist Francisco de Paula Cândido, in whose honor the neighborhood was first named &quot;Paula Cândido&quot;. The hospital&#x27;s function was to isolate the sick people that came with the ships that docked in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s harbor. Later, the hospital was turned into a safe house to receive children that had been infected with tuberculosis known as Preventório, after which the local beach came to be known.

In the 1940s, an aeroclub was built in the area. It still exists and can handle small, private planes and helicopter landings and take-offs.

The neighborhood&#x27;s limits are: the waters of the Guanabara Bay, the neighborhood of Piratininga (at the Viração Hill) and the neighborhoods of Jurujuba and São Francisco (contiguous boundary). Its territory is located in the São Francisco Ensenada, which is the land comprised between the &quot;Viração Hill&quot; and the shore.

The local population of approximately 3,854 (in 1991) represents 0.88% of Niterói&#x27;s total population. A small chanty town exists on the &quot;Preventório Hill&quot;.

In June 2024, the beach at Charitas was considered suitable for swimming, except for the stretch to the right of the Clube Naval.
