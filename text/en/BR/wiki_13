<text>Kisumu ( ) is the third-largest city in Kenya located in the Lake Victoria area in the former Nyanza Province. It is the second-largest city after Kampala in the Lake Victoria Basin. The city has a population of slightly over 600,000. The metro region, including Maseno and Ahero, has a population of 1,155,574 people (560,942 males, 594,609 females and 23 intersex) according to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census which was conducted by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics. 

Apart from being an important political city, it is one of the premier industrial and commercial centres in Kenya. It is also an intellectual city with many PhDs. The city is currently undergoing an urban rejuvenation of the downtown and lower town which includes modernizing the lake front, decongesting main streets, and making the streets pedestrian-friendly.

Culturally, Kisumu serves as the centre of the Luo people of East Africa. It was the most prominent urban centre in the pre-colonial and post-colonial period. It remains prominent in the modern era for natives of the Kavirondo region. It was briefly renamed Port Florence, before its name was reverted back.

The city serves as the capital of Kisumu County and was the immediate former capital of now-defunct Nyanza Province. 
It is an important link in the trade route between Lake Victoria and Mombasa because of its water and rail connections. It is also the chief terminus for the agricultural produce of Nyanza and Western regions. Kisumu International Airport has regular flights to Nairobi and other neighbouring cities such as Mombasa. According to the United Nations, Kisumu is now recognized as a key city and a &quot;Millennium City&quot; – the first of its kind in the world and also in East Africa.

Kisumu&#x27;s elevation is and is about northwest of Nairobi, on the shores of Lake Victoria. It lies at the northeastern edge of the Winam Gulf, a long, shallow arm that protrudes from the main body of Lake Victoria. Kisumu is south of the equator and has, due to its elevation, moderate temperatures.

The metropolitan region comprises the city and its suburbs and satellite towns of Maseno, Kondele, and Ahero.

==Etymology==
When Europeans first settled in the area in the late 19th century, Kisumu became a trading post – attracting Luo people from as far as Migori and Siaya County. The Kisumu region was then occupied by the Luo community. A person going to Kisumu at that time would say, &quot;Adhi Kisuma&quot; to mean I&#x27;m going to trade. Derived from the word &quot;Kisuma&quot;, the word for a trading post in Luo is &quot;Kisumo&quot;, and in Nandi, &quot;Kesumett&quot;. The current name &quot;Kisumu&quot; is an English corruption of the word &quot;Kisumo&quot; or &quot;Kesumett&quot;.

An opposing theory states that Kisumu acquired its name from &#x27;Kusuma&#x27;, the Maragoli word for &#x27;trading&#x27;. Because, before Luo arrived in the area, the Maragoli were already trading with other people in the area like the Nandi and the Maasai. Some Luo words were acquired from the Maragoli.

==History==
Kisumu City is believed to be one of the oldest settlements in Kenya with historical records indicating that Kisumu was dominated by diverse communities at different times long before Europeans
arrived. The people from the Nandi, Kalenjin, Kisii, Maasai, Luo and Luhya communities converged at the tip of Lake Victoria and called the place &quot;sumo&quot; which literally means &quot;a place of barter trade&quot;. Each community called it different names, for instance:
# The Luo called it &quot;Kisumo&quot; meaning &quot;a place to look for food&quot; such that the Luo would say &quot;I am going Kisuma&quot; to mean &quot;I am going to look for food&quot;.
# The Abaluhya called it &quot;Abhasuma&quot; which means &quot;a place to borrow food&quot;, such that the Luhya would say &quot;I am going Khusuma&quot; to mean &quot;I am going to borrow food&quot;.
# The Abagusii called it &quot;egesumu&quot; meaning &quot;a structure for keeping/rearing chicken&quot;. It is believed the Abagusii were in Kisumu but found Kisumu was not good for crop husbandry and agriculture.
# The Nandi called it &quot;Kisumett&quot; which means a place where food was found during times of scarcity and exchange, which cannot be attacked by Nandi and Terik irrespective of any issue.
#Industries are centred on processing agricultural products, brewing, and textile manufacturing. Asians once constituted more than one-fourth of the population, but declined after independence in 1963.

Kisumu was identified by the British explorers in early 1898 as an alternative railway terminus and port for the Uganda Railway, then under construction. It was to replace Port Victoria, then an important centre on the caravan trade route, near the delta of the Nzoia River. Kisumu was ideally located on the shores of Lake Victoria at the cusp of the Winam Gulf, at the end of the caravan trail from Pemba, Mombasa, and Malindi and had the potential for connections to the whole of the Lake region via steam ships. In July 1899, the first skeleton plan for Kisumu was prepared. This included landing places and wharves along the northern lakeshore, near the present-day Airport Road. Demarcations for government buildings and retail shops were also included in the plan.

Another plan was later prepared in May 1900, when plots were allocated to a few European firms as well as to Indian traders who had travelled to Kisumu on contracts to build the Uganda Railway and had decided to settle at the expanding terminus. A later plan included a flying boat jetty (now used by the Fisheries Department). In October 1900, the 62-ton ship SS William Mackinnon was reassembled and registered in Kisumu, and made its maiden voyage to Entebbe, marking the beginning of the Lake Marine Services. The SS Winifred (1901) and the SS Sybil (1901) were later added to the fleet in 1902 and 1904, respectively. On Friday, 20 December 1901, the railway line reached the Kisumu pier, adopting a new name, Port Florence.

By February 1903, the railway line had been opened for goods and passenger transportation. Kisumu was also privileged to host the first flight in Kenya; the current police workshop was the first hangar in Kenya. Before the jet airline era, the city was a landing point on the British flying boat passenger and mail route from Southampton to Cape Town. Kisumu also linked Port Bell to Nairobi.
In the meantime, it was realised that the site originally chosen for the township north of the Nyanza Gulf was unsuitable for the town&#x27;s expansion, due to its flat topography and poor soils. An alternative site was therefore identified and the town&#x27;s location moved to the ridge on the southern shore of the Gulf, where the town is today. Consequently, another plan was prepared in 1902, which provided the basic layout of the new town on the southern ridge. This was followed by the construction of a number of government buildings, notably the former Provincial Commissioner&#x27;s Office (now State Lodge) and the Old Prison (now earmarked for the construction of an Anglican cathedral).

In 1903, the township boundaries were gazetted and some , including water, set aside for its development. The new township reverted to its original name, Kisumu, in substitution for Port Florence. At this time, there was an &#x27;Old Kisumu&#x27; that consisted of two rows of stalls (Dukas) on Mumias Road, north of the Gulf. It was demolished in the twenties when new plots became available on Odera and Ogada Streets in the present-day Kisumu, hence the new area acquired the name &#x27;New Bazaar&#x27;. Winston Churchill visited Kisumu in 1907.

By the 1930s and 40s, the city had become a leading centre for commerce, administrative and military installations. In the 1960s the population of Asians in relation to locals was significantly higher. The town was elevated to the status of a municipal board in 1940 and later to a municipal council in 1960. In the early sixties, very little development took place in Kisumu, with an acute shortage in housing, shops and offices. The situation was made worse by the influx of locals into the town following the declaration of independence in 1963.

The city&#x27;s growth and prosperity slowed down temporarily in 1977, as a result of the collapse of the East African Community. However, the city spurred with the reformation of the community in 1996 and with its designation as a &quot;city&quot;. The port has been stimulated by the transformation of international business and trade, as well as the shipments of goods destined for Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Currently, Kisumu is one of the fastest-growing cities in Kenya. It is thriving with the sugar and rice irrigation industries, whose contribution to the national economy is immense due to its natural resources and as the epicentre for business in Kenya. 
== Culture and languages ==

English is one of two official languages of Kenya, the other being Kiswahili. Most people in Kisumu are trilingual and are also fluent in Dholuo, the local language of the Luo, Kenya&#x27;s fourth-largest ethnic group, to which 90% of Kisumu residents belong. Due to its growth since the advent of devolution, there has been a recent increase in other local ethnic groups within the city.

==Climate==

Kisumu features a tropical rainforest climate with no true dry season and significant rainfall year-round. January is the driest month while the month of April receives the most rainfall. The average temperature is 22.9°C.


==Agriculture==
Kisumu has highly fertile land and variations in temperature and rainfall with two rainy seasons per year across the region provide a suitable environment for a broad range of agricultural crops. The Kisumu region has approximately 1.6 million hectares of agricultural land. However, it is estimated that only 58 percent of the land is currently used. The majority of farming in the lake basin region is subsistence agriculture, leading to relatively low production volumes. Current crop yields are considered to be significantly lower than the potential afforded by soil and climate conditions. Current low land utilisation and yields are driven by the lack of guaranteed markets and associated support services. Like agriculture, livestock farming is currently performed primarily on a subsistence basis. Cattle are predominantly indigenous breeds with lower milk output than grade cattle.

===Aquaculture===
The Kenyan part of Lake Victoria covers approximately 400,000 hectares (4,100 square kilometres), with of lake shoreline; most of this shoreline is under-used.

== Points of interest ==

Attractions in the city include Kibuye Market, Oile Market, the Kisumu Museum, an impala sanctuary, a bird sanctuary, Hippo Point, shopping malls and the nearby Kit Mikaye and Ndere Island National Park. Although Kisumu has modernized over the years, it still maintains an old town feel, especially on the outskirts, and the culture is still very ingrained.

===Town Clock===
On the main street of Kisumu city, Oginga Odinga Road, a tall town clock stands in the middle of the road. It was unveiled on 19 August 1938 by the then Governor of Kenya Sir Robert Brooke-Popham. The town clock was built in memory of Kassim Lakha, who arrived in East Africa in 1871 and died in Kampala in 1910. It was erected by his sons Mohamed, Alibhai, Hassan and Rahimtulla Kassim, as the inscription on the Town Clock reads.

===Kisumu Museum===
Kisumu Museum, established in 1980, has a series of outdoor pavilions laid out in a formation similar to that of a Luo homestead. Some of the pavilions contain live animals. For example, one pavilion contains numerous aquaria with a wide variety of fish from Lake Victoria, along with explanatory posters. Another pavilion contains a terrarium containing mambas, spitting cobras, puff adders and other venomous Kenyan snakes. Outside, the museum has a few additional exhibits, including a snake pit and a crocodile container.

Other pavilions show weaponry, jewellery, farm tools and other artefacts of the various peoples of Nyanza Province. Additionally, there are exhibits of stuffed animals, birds and fish. One pavilion houses the prehistoric TARA rock art, which was removed for its own protection to the museum after it was defaced by graffiti in its original location.

The museum&#x27;s most important and largest exhibition is the UNESCO-sponsored Ber-gi-dala. This is a full-scale recreation of a traditional Luo homestead. Ber-gi-dala consists of the home, granaries and livestock corrals of an imaginary Luo man as well as the homes of each of his three wives and his eldest son. Through signs and taped programs in both Luo and English, the exhibition also explains the origins of the Luo people, their migration to western Kenya, traditional healing plants, and the process of establishing a new home.

===Dunga Beach and Wetland===
Dunga Beach and Wetland is known for its biodiversity and its cultural rich and diverse papyrus wetland ecosystem and local community respectively. Ecofinder Kenya has established Dunga Wetland Pedagogical Centre at Dunga Beach, a grass-roots led intervention whose cardinal goal is the empowerment of the Dunga Wetland community and improvement of the livelihood security of its people. Therefore, some of the main focuses in the centre are promoting eco-cultural tourism and facilitating the conservation of the Dunga Papyrus Wetland Ecosystem.

===Kisumu Impala Sanctuary===
Kisumu is the location of the . During British rule, the Impala Park sanctuary was called Connaught Parade. Measuring just , the sanctuary is one of Kenya&#x27;s smallest wildlife preserves. As its name suggests, it is home to a herd of impala, some hippos, and many reptiles and birds. Additionally, several baboons (monkeys) and leopards who faced difficulties in the wild are housed in cages. Over 115 different species of birds live there.
===Hippo Point===
Hippo Point is a viewing area on Lake Victoria. Despite its name, it is better known as a viewing point for its unobstructed sunsets over the lake than for its occasional hippos. Hippo Point is located near the village of Dunga, a few kilometres southwest of the city. The village also has a fishing port and a camping site.

===Kit Mikayi===
Kit Mikayi, a large rock with three rocks on top, is located off Kisumu Bondo Road towards Bondo. Kit-mikayi means &quot;Stones of the first wife&quot; or &quot;First Wife Rocks&quot; in Dholuo, the Luo language. It is a weeping rock; it is believed that Mikayi (literally, &quot;the first wife&quot;) went up the hill to the stones when her husband took a second wife and has been weeping ever since. It has become a local pilgrimage site for adherents of the Legio Maria sect who, come to the rock to pray and fast for several weeks at a time.

===Ndere Island===

Ndere Island is a small island in the Winam Gulf of Lake Victoria. It was gazetted as the Ndere Island National Reserve in November 1986 and has since been uninhabited. It has sweeping views over the lake in a much more serene and tranquil environment than the mainland.

==Sport==
Moi Stadium plays home to various teams such as the Kisumu All Stars and Kisumu Telkom FC.
Peter Anyang&#x27; Nyong&#x27;o, the governor and father of Hollywood star Lupita Nyong&#x27;o, announced that the county will build a brand new stadium. At the same time, the country&#x27;s current government has plans to build a national stadium. As of 2018, neither plan has materialized.

Kisumu is represented in the nationwide rugby league by Kisumu RFC. The city is also host to a leg of the national rugby sevens circuit, one of only six city hosts. The Kisumu leg is referred to as the Dala sevens and the annual tournament attracts thousands of fans from across the country.

Kisumu is served by Kisumu International Airport which has international status, with regular daily flights to Nairobi and Mombasa. Expansion of the airport cargo facility after completion of the passenger terminals is currently going on in anticipation of increased trade brought about by the recreated East African Community of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

===Water===
Lake Victoria ferries have operated from the port linking the railway to Mwanza and Bukoba in Tanzania, and to Entebbe, Port Bell, and Jinja in Uganda. The first steamships built in Kisumu in 1905 were the SS Sybilla and the SS Nyanza.

===Rail===
The Uganda Railway from the port of Mombasa reached Kisumu in 1901.
Until 2013 passenger trains operate between Nairobi and Kisumu using the revamped meter gauge rail run by the defunct Rift Valley Railways.
A standard gauge railway from Nairobi to Naivasha was opened up to Suswa in 2019. A second section of should have brought the standard gauge to Kisumu, a new station and a port on Lake Victoria being planned. The plans not materialising due to lack of funding, a project to rebuild the metre gauge line from the Ugandan capital Kampala to the frontier and onwards to the existing Kenyan metre gauge railway past Kisumu found funding from the African Development Bank in 2022.

===Road===
Former president Mwai Kibaki launched a Ksh. 6.8 billion road project for a major overhaul of Kisumu&#x27;s road network on 24 July 2009.
The city is connected to the cities of Nakuru, Nairobi and Mombasa via the A104 highway and to the city of Eldoret via the B1 highway.
A Lake Victoria ring road along the shores of the lake is currently under construction and will pass by the city.

===Rail and air accidents===
During World War II, three aircraft operated by the South African Air Force crashed into Lake Victoria soon after take-off from Kisumu Airport. The first, a Lockheed Lodestar aircraft number &quot;K&quot;-248 (ex ZS-ATK) carrying a senior South African military officer, Major General Dan Pienaar, crashed on 19 December 1942, killing all 12 persons on board. The other two crashes involved Douglas C-47 planes; the first on 11 May 1945 (one fatality) and the second exactly three months later, on 11 July 1945 (28 fatalities). The bodies from the two earlier accidents were repatriated to South Africa, those from the third accident are buried in the Kisumu war-graves cemetery. The cause of the accidents is currently thought to have been the katabatic wind condition which often affects Kisumu in the early morning.

Two serious railway accidents occurred near Kisumu in the 2000s.

The first took place outside Kisumu on 15 August 2000. The brakes on the train failed, causing it to roll. Thirteen people were killed and 37 received injuries. The second took place on the morning of 16 October 2005, when a &quot;matatu&quot; (taxi minibus) was struck by a passenger train. Six people died and 23 more were injured.

After that there have been accidents in its major towns with notable black spots: &quot;Ojola/Kisian&quot;, &quot;Kisat bridge&quot;, &quot;Ahero&quot;, &quot;Sondu&quot;, &quot;Awasi&quot; just to mention a few. The Busia-Kisumu highway is becoming increasingly congested, posing risks to road users. The County Government of Kisumu has been urged to consider dualizing the roads to prevent accidents that have claimed numerous lives and caused lasting physical and psychological harm to motorists and pedestrians.

<text>The Frisian Islands, also known as the Wadden Islands or the Wadden Sea Islands, form an archipelago at the eastern edge of the North Sea in northwestern Europe, stretching from the northwest of the Netherlands through Germany to the west of Denmark. The islands shield the mudflat region of the Wadden Sea (large parts of which fall dry during low tide) from the North Sea.

The Frisian Islands, along with the mainland coast in the German Bight, form the region of Frisia (German and Dutch: &quot;Friesland&quot;), homeland of the Frisian people. Generally, the term Frisian Islands is used for the islands where Frisian is spoken and the population is ethnically Frisian. In contrast, the term Wadden Islands applies to the entire archipelago, including the Dutch-speaking westernmost islands of Texel and Vlieland, Danish-speaking Danish Wadden Sea Islands further north off the west coast of Jutland and the Islands of Trischen and Neuwerk.

Most of the Wadden Sea Islands are environmentally protected areas, and an international wildlife nature reserve is being coordinated between the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. Natural gas and oil drilling continue, however, and in the vicinity of the Ems, Weser and Elbe estuaries, ship traffic causes tension between wildlife protection and economic values.

==History==

===Origins===
During the last ice age, which ended approximately 12,000 years ago, sea level was about lower than it is now, and part of what is now the North Sea was dry land. With the melting of the ice caps, the sea level rose, reaching the current coast line around the beginning of the Holocene era, approximately 7,000 years ago. Tidal action transported large quantities of sand to form a line of dunes extending over from the Netherlands to the mouth of the river Elbe in Germany. The sea broke through the dunes in many places to form the Wadden Islands, with the low-lying country behind becoming the tidal Wadden mudflats.

====Island forming====
The Dutch West Frisian and the German East Frisian Islands are barrier islands. They arose along the breakers&#x27; edge where the water surge piled up sediment, and behind which sediment was carried away by the breaking waves. Over time, shoals arose, which ultimately were only covered by infrequent storm floods. Once plants began to colonize the sandbanks, the land began to stabilize.

In contrast, the North Frisian Islands arose from the remains of old Geestland islands, where the land was partially removed by storm floods and water action and then separated from the mainland. They are, therefore, often higher and their cores are less exposed to changes than the islands to the south. Beyond the core, however, the same processes are at work, as is particularly evident on Sylt, where the south of the island threatens to be broken away and the harbour at List in the north silts up.
The Danish Islands, the next in the chain to the north, arose from sandbanks. Into the 20th century, silt on the islands was a serious problem. To protect them, small woods were planted.

===Habitation===
Long before the beginning of the modern era, there were already humans inhabiting the Wadden area. Up to 800 AD, most inhabitants lived on terpen (artificial mounds). Living conditions were difficult. The Roman naturalist Pliny, writing in the first century AD, described the Frisians as ...
... people who live without trees or shrubs. ... in the east, to the coasts of the ocean, a number of races in such needy conditions exist; but this also applies to the races of peoples which are called the large and small Chaucen, which we have seen in the north. There, two times in each period of a day and a night, the ocean with a fast tide submerges an immense plain, thereby the hiding ... whether the area is sea or land. There this miserable race inhabits raised pieces ground or platforms, which they have moored by hand above the level of the highest known tide. Living in huts built on the chosen spots, they seem like sailors in ships if water covers the surrounding country, but like shipwrecked people when the tide has withdrawn itself, and around their huts they catch fish which try to escape with the expiring tide. It is for them not possible to keep herds and live on milk such as the surrounding tribes. They cannot even fight with wild animals, because all the bush country lies too far away. They braid ropes of sedges and rushes from the marshes with which they make nets to be able to catch fish, and they dig up mud with their hands and dry it more in wind than in the sun, and with soil as fuel they heat their food and their own bodies, frozen in northern wind. Their only drink comes from storing rain water in tanks front of their houses. And these are the races which, if they were now conquered by the Roman nation, say that they will fall into slavery! It is only too true: Destiny saves people as a punishment.
Around 1000AD, dike construction began. Monks were instrumental in this activity, among others those of the monastery of Aduard. But earlier attempts had been undertaken to dam the sea. At the Frisian Peins (near Franeker), a 40-meter section of dike has been discovered that is thought to date from the 1st or 2nd century BC.

In the late Middle Ages, the dike system was gradually strengthened and flooding diminished. Beginning in the 17th century, dikes were built further out to reclaim more land. This activity peaked in the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Conservation of the West Frisian/Dutch coast===
The dunes south of the Wadden Sea were also liable to this process, but human intervention prevented the many storm surges from changing the coast of the provinces North Holland and South Holland into separate islands with Wadden mudflats behind them. However, around 1200AD, storm surges did break up the northern coast of Western Friesland into five islands. Around 1600AD, four of these along the West coast had been again recovered, but Wieringen, to the south-east of Texel, remained an island up to the 20th century.

== Archaeology ==
In 2019, Dutch maritime investigators unearthed a 16th century shipwreck during a search for containers from MSC Zoe. According to Holland’s National Office for Cultural Heritage, the ship was built circa 1540 in the Netherlands during the reign of Charles V. Researchers also found copper plates with emblem of the Fugger family and wooden beams with a sleek hull about 30 metres long.

==Embankment of the mudflat==
In Friesland and Groningen plans were made to embank and drain the Wadden Sea. As a result, the islands would have become part of the mainland. As of today, nature and environmental movements have been able to prevent this.

The only plan ever to be carried out was the construction of a causeway from the Frisian Holwerd to Ameland, in 1872, which was not very successful. Shortly after construction, the causeway had already suffered so much storm damage that the dam was abandoned in 1882. The dam has been almost entirely eroded since then.

In the northern Wadden Sea building dams proved to be considerably simpler. Nordstrand is now so much linked to the rampart by dikes that it is difficult to define it as an island, and also Langeness, Oland, Nordstrandischmoor, Hamburger Hallig, Sylt, and Rømø are all reachable by dams. Mandø is even reachable without a dam by means of tidal road.

==Development==

===Migration===
The Wadden Islands are in continuous apparent movement. The most important movement is the &#x27;migration&#x27;: the islands themselves are slowly but certainly moving from West to East. On the West side most of the islands disappear slowly into the sea and on the East side even larger sand-banks arise. This movement is also the reason that most of the villages themselves are on the West side of their island. When they were founded they were situated in the center. Over the course of the last few centuries, many houses and even entire villages disappeared into the sea.

===Hook shaping===
The second movement is the development of a hook shape. Along the sea breaches hook-shaped sand ridges arise, which change form with the moving of the sea arm. By growth of these hooks new shoals arise such as the Noorderhaaks and Zuiderhaaks. Sometimes such a shoal grows, originating where an island has been &#x27;walking&#x27;, and the island regains area.

==Islands==

===Dutch Wadden Islands===
(from West to East)

====Inhabited====
*Texel (largest of all Frisian Islands and most populous of the West Frisian Islands)
*Vlieland
*Terschelling
*Ameland
*Schiermonnikoog

The Dutch islands have a surface of 405.2 km² and a total of 23,872 inhabitants.

====Uninhabited====
*Noorderhaaks
*Richel
*Griend
*Rif
*Engelsmanplaat
*Simonszand
*Rottumerplaat
*Rottumeroog
*Zuiderduintjes

The names of all these places suggest this is the transition area between island and shoal (&quot;plaat&quot; in Dutch). Noorderhaaks, Griend, Rottumerplaat and Rottumeroog are generally considered to be islands, the others are considered to be sandbars and disappear from time to time into the waves. The former island of Wieringen can be found at the top of North Holland, against the Afsluitdijk.

===German Wadden Islands===

(from West to East and South to North)
====Inhabited====
*Borkum
*Juist
*Norderney
*Baltrum
*Langeoog
*Spiekeroog
*Wangerooge
*Neuwerk
*Pellworm
*Nordstrand (presently mainland)
*Inhabited Halligen
*Amrum
*Föhr
*Sylt

====Uninhabited====
*Lütje Hörn
*Kachelotplate
*Memmert
*Minsener Oog
*Alte Mellum
*Großer Knechtsand
*Nigehörn
*Scharhörn
*Trischen
*Tertius (frequently submerged)
*Blauort
*Süderoogsand
*Norderoogsand
*Japsand
*Uninhabited Halligen (Habel, Südfall, Norderoog)

The German islands have a surface of 448.52 km² (173 sq. mi.) and 53,296 inhabitants. It is possible to make a boat excursion from several German Wadden Islands to the small rock island of Helgoland which is situated off the German coast. Although Heligoland (German: Helgoland) is not a Wadden Island, there are strong cultural links with the Wadden area; for example a dialect of North Frisian is spoken there.

Not all these islands are officially considered to be Wadden Islands. For the definition of an island, a minimum of 160 hectares (0.6 sq. mi.) must no longer be submerged during average high water by the North Sea.

===Danish Wadden Islands===

(from South to North)
*Rømø
*Mandø
*Koresand (uninhabited)
*Fanø
*Langli (uninhabited)

In the 20th century, south of the Danish island Rømø lay the small island Jordsand, which sank in 1999. North of the Danish island Fanø the sand coast has been opened and closed numerous times in the course of history, but at the moment the coast line is closed, and forms a whole again except for two west coast fjords. The Danish islands have a total surface of 193.8 km² (74.5 sq. mi.) and 4,173 inhabitants.

<doc id="512547" wikidata="Q741309" url="?curid=512547" title="Flans">
<text>Flans are an all-female Mexican music group, which enjoyed popularity from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Its members were the singers Ivonne Margarita Guevara García, Ilse María Olivo Schweinfurth and Irma Angélica Hernández Ochoa. They were generally known as Ivonne, Ilse, and Mimí.

==Career==

===Beginnings===
The three girls were initially cast in the mid-1980s for a TV show to be called &quot;Fans&quot;, which was to feature chats and sing-alongs with guest stars. When plans for the show fell through, a project was started to turn the girls into a pop music sensation. The group was renamed Flans and their first album, &quot;Flans&quot;, was launched in 1985. Their style was mainly pop music and ballads although one of their albums (&quot;Cuéntamelo Dum-Dum&quot;) was somewhat child-oriented.

===First breakup===
The group released a new album every year until 1991 when they separated, with a national tour and the release of their &quot;last&quot; album: &quot;Adiós&quot;. After their separation, Ivonne married and devoted herself to painting; Mimí and Ilse started solo careers, with Mimí also being the host for a TV show.

===Reunion===
Rumors of a reunion started in early 1999 and were confirmed with a performance at the Acapulco Milenio Festival, followed by a tour which included several performance at the prestigious Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. A new album, &quot;Hadas&quot;, was released later that year and promoted throughout 2000, with the singles Hadas, Tu Eterna Pesadilla, Rufino and Si Te Vas.

Due to a dispute with their former manager Mildred Villafañe over the ownership of the name &quot;Flans&quot;, the group changed their name to &quot;IIM&quot; in 2002 and released a new album featuring three new songs and new versions of their greatest hits.

===&quot;20 Millas Después&quot;===
In 2006 Ilse, Ivonne and Mimi regrouped for a goodbye tour titled &quot;20 Millas Después&quot;. Once again performing under the name Flans, they offered a final concert at Plaza Mexico, in Mexico City. Following the tour, Ilse and Mimi expressed an interest in recording a new album, however Ivonne said she was not interested in being part of the group anymore.

===Third Reunion===
In 2011 the three members of the band participated in a photo shoot for MEXICO SUENA, a book showcasing the best in Mexican pop culture. The following year Ilse and Mimi joined forces for the &#x27;Y Si Nosotras...&#x27; tour, without Ivonne.

The band performed together again in early 2013, at a special showcase, and announced a new tour &#x27;Hoy Por Ti, Manana Por Mi&#x27;. Due to the ongoing dispute with their former manager, the three women are now performing simply as &#x27;Ilse, Ivonne y Mimi&#x27;. They toured Mexico, Central America and the United States throughout 2013.

===Primera Fila===
In May 2014, Ilse, Ivonne y Mimi announced they would record a &quot;Primera Fila&quot; album for Sony Music. The album was recorded in Mexico City on June, 12, 2014, and the first single &#x27;Yo No Sería Yo&#x27; was released on August 20, 2014. The album titled &quot;Primera Fila Flans&quot;, presumably because they are mostly known by their original name &quot;Flans&quot;, was released on September 30, 2014, and a new tour began in Querétaro, México, on October 26, 2014.

<text>1729 is the natural number following 1728 and preceding 1730. It is the first nontrivial taxicab number, expressed as the sum of two cubic numbers in two different ways. It is known as the Ramanujan number or Hardy–Ramanujan number after G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan.

== As a natural number ==
1729 is composite, the squarefree product of three prime numbers 7 × 13 × 19. It has as factors 1, 7, 13, 19, 91, 133, 247, and 1729. It is the third Carmichael number, and the first Chernick–Carmichael number. Furthermore, it is the first in the family of absolute Euler pseudoprimes, a subset of Carmichael numbers. 1729 is divisible by 19, the sum of its digits, making it a harshad number in base 10.

1729 is the dimension of the Fourier transform on which the fastest known algorithm for multiplying two numbers is based. This is an example of a galactic algorithm.

1729 can be expressed as the quadratic form. Investigating pairs of its distinct integer-valued that represent every integer the same number of times, Schiemann found that such quadratic forms must be in four or more variables, and the least possible discriminant of a four-variable pair is 1729.

Visually, 1729 can be found in other figurate numbers. It is the tenth centered cube number (a number that counts the points in a three-dimensional pattern formed by a point surrounded by concentric cubical layers of points), the nineteenth dodecagonal number (a figurate number in which the arrangement of points resembles the shape of a dodecagon), the thirteenth 24-gonal and the seventh 84-gonal number.

== As a Ramanujan number ==
1729 is also known as &quot;Ramanujan number&quot; or &quot;Hardy–Ramanujan number&quot;, named after an anecdote of the British mathematician G. H. Hardy when he visited Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan who was ill in a hospital. In their conversation, Hardy stated that the number 1729 from a taxicab he rode was a &quot;dull&quot; number and &quot;hopefully it is not unfavourable omen&quot;, but Ramanujan remarked that &quot;it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways&quot;. This conversation led to the definition of the taxicab number as the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two positive cubes in distinct ways. 1729 is the second taxicab number, expressed as formula_1 and formula_2.

1729 was later found in one of Ramanujan&#x27;s notebooks dated years before the incident, and it was noted by French mathematician Frénicle de Bessy in 1657. A commemorative plaque now appears at the site of the Ramanujan–Hardy incident, at 2 Colinette Road in Putney.

The same expression defines 1729 as the first in the sequence of &quot;Fermat near misses&quot; defined, in reference to Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, as numbers of the form formula_3, which are also expressible as the sum of two other cubes.

<text>Rottumeroog (; ) is an uninhabited island in the Wadden Sea and is part of the Netherlands. The island is one of three West Frisian Islands in the province of Groningen. It is situated between the islands of Rottumerplaat and Borkum.

The island originates from the 15th or 16th century. At first the island was used for agriculture by the St. Juliana&#x27;s Abbey from Rottum. Rottumeroog is now part of the natural reserve Rottum and access to the island is prohibited, save for people with a special permit.

== Geography ==
Rottumeroog is located at in the municipality of Het Hogeland in the north of the province of Groningen in the north of the Netherlands. It is situated off the coast of Groningen&#x27;s mainland and it is the easternmost island of the West Frisian Islands in the Wadden Sea, east of the island of Rottumerplaat, north of the island of Zuiderduintjes, and west of the East Frisian island of Borkum (Germany).

Rottumeroog does not have a solid core and slowly moves in southeastern direction as a result of sea currents. On the north side, land is gradually washed away; on the south side, new land is forming. Rottumeroog had a surface area of in 1995 and in 2007.

== History ==

Between 1400 and 1540 CE, the island of Monnikenlangenoog had split into the islands of Bosch and Rottumeroog. Bosch had disappeared in the 18th century, but Rottumeroog still remains today.

The name Rottumeroog means literally &#x27;Island of Rottum&#x27;, after the village of Rottum on the mainland of Groningen. The Benedictine St. Juliana&#x27;s Abbey in Rottum used to own two-thirds of the island and used it for their livestock. After the Protestant Reformation the island&#x27;s rights transferred to the province Groningen before being sold to private persons in the 17th century. 

Between 1706 and 1717, Donough MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty, having been banished from Ireland, owned and lived on the island.

The province bought the island back in 1738 due to back maintenance, eventually the central government took over. Until 1965 the island was inhabited by a &quot;vogt&quot; and his family; since then the island has been uninhabited.

Several buildings have been built on the island. In the 19th century the navigational beacon &quot;Zeekaap Rottumeroog&quot; was built. The structure is listed as a national heritage site (&quot;rijksmonument&quot;) since 1988 and was moved southwards in 1999. The &quot;voogt&quot; had a house as well; this building was demolished in 1998 due to the encroaching North Sea. In February 2014, the bird observation post was removed from the island. Later in 2014 all remaining buildings on the islands, except for the Zeekaap Rottumeroog were removed due to the changing shape and position of the island.

The future area of the island is uncertain. In 2012, the island broke into two during high tide, giving rise to the claim that the island might disappear in the Ems estuary in the near future.

== Natural reserve ==
The Wadden Sea, in which Rottumeroog is situated, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (natural criteria viii, ix, and x) since 2009.

Together with Rottumerplaat and Zuiderduintjes, the island forms the natural reserve Rottum. The island is generally not maintained, the shape and position are left for nature to change. The island is uninhabited and access is usually prohibited; several excursions to the islands are allowed each year under strict conditions.

The island is home to birds and grey seals.

<text>Hemorheology, also spelled haemorheology (&quot;haemo&quot; from Greek ‘αἷμα, &quot;haima&quot; &#x27;blood&#x27;; and &quot;rheology&quot;, from Greek ῥέω &quot;rhéō&quot;, &#x27;flow&#x27; and -λoγία, &quot;-logia&quot; &#x27;study of&#x27;), or blood rheology, is the study of flow properties of blood and its elements of plasma and cells. Proper tissue perfusion can occur only when blood&#x27;s rheological properties are within certain levels. Alterations of these properties play significant roles in disease processes. Blood viscosity is determined by plasma viscosity, hematocrit (volume fraction of red blood cell, which constitute 99.9% of the cellular elements) and mechanical properties of red blood cells. Red blood cells have unique mechanical behavior, which can be discussed under the terms erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte aggregation. Because of that, blood behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid. As such, the viscosity of blood varies with shear rate. Blood becomes less viscous at high shear rates like those experienced with increased flow such as during exercise or in peak-systole. Therefore, blood is a shear-thinning fluid. Contrarily, blood viscosity increases when shear rate goes down with increased vessel diameters or with low flow, such as downstream from an obstruction or in diastole. Blood viscosity also increases with increases in red cell aggregability.

== Blood viscosity ==

Blood viscosity is a measure of the resistance of blood to flow. It can also be described as the thickness and stickiness of blood. This biophysical property makes it a critical determinant of friction against the vessel walls, the rate of venous return, the work required for the heart to pump blood, and how much oxygen is transported to tissues and organs. These functions of the cardiovascular system are directly related to vascular resistance, preload, afterload, and perfusion, respectively.

The primary determinants of blood viscosity are hematocrit, red blood cell deformability, red blood cell aggregation, and plasma viscosity. Plasma&#x27;s viscosity is determined by water-content and macromolecular components, so these factors that affect blood viscosity are the plasma protein concentration and types of proteins in the plasma. Nevertheless, hematocrit has the strongest impact on whole blood viscosity. One unit increase in hematocrit can cause up to a 4% increase in blood viscosity. This relationship becomes increasingly sensitive as hematocrit increases. When the hematocrit rises to 60 or 70%, which it often does in polycythemia, the blood viscosity can become as great as 10 times that of water, and its flow through blood vessels is greatly retarded because of increased resistance to flow. This will lead to decreased oxygen delivery. Other factors influencing blood viscosity include temperature, where an increase in temperature results in a decrease in viscosity. This is particularly important in hypothermia, where an increase in blood viscosity will cause problems with blood circulation.

=== Clinical significance ===
Many conventional cardiovascular risk factors have been independently linked to whole blood viscosity.

Anemia can reduce blood viscosity, which may lead to heart failure.
Furthermore, elevation of plasma viscosity correlates to the progression of coronary and peripheral artery diseases.

=== Normal level ===

In pascal-seconds (Pa·s), the viscosity formula_1 of blood at 37 °C is normally 3 × 10−3 to 4 × 10−3, respectively 3 - 4 centipoise (cP) in the centimetre gram second system of units.

where formula_4 is the density. Blood viscosity can be measured by viscometers capable of measurements at various shear rates, such as a rotational viscometer.

== Blood viscoelasticity ==

Blood is a viscoelastic fluid, meaning that it possesses both viscous and fluid characteristics. The viscous component arises primarily through the viscosity of blood plasma, while the elastic component arises from deformation of the red blood cells. As the heart contracts, mechanical energy is transferred from the heart to the blood; a small part of the energy is dissipated by the viscosity of the suspension, another part is stored as elastic energy in the red blood cells, and the remaining energy is used to drive blood circulation and is thus converted to kinetic energy. Viscoelastic fluids make up a larger class of fluids called non-Newtonian fluids.

The red blood cells occupy about half of the volume of blood and possess elastic properties. This elastic property is the largest contributing factor to the viscoelastic behavior of blood. The large volume percentage of red blood cells at a normal hematocrit level leaves little room for cell motion and deformation without interacting with a neighboring cell. Calculations have shown that the maximum volume percentage of red blood cells without deformation is 58% which is in the range of normally occurring levels. Due to the limited space between red blood cells, it is obvious that in order for blood to flow, significant cell to cell interaction will play a key role. This interaction and tendency for cells to aggregate is a major contributor to the viscoelastic behavior of blood. Red blood cell deformation and aggregation is also coupled with flow-induced changes in the arrangement and orientation as a third major factor in its viscoelastic behavior. Other factors contributing to the viscoelastic properties of blood is the plasma viscosity, plasma composition, temperature, and the rate of flow or shear rate. Together, these factors make human blood viscoelastic, non-Newtonian, and thixotropic.

When the red cells are at rest or at very small shear rates, they tend to aggregate and stack together in an energetically favorable manner. The attraction is attributed to charged groups on the surface of cells and to the presence of fibrinogen and globulins. This aggregated configuration is an arrangement of cells with the least amount of deformation. With very low shear rates, the viscoelastic property of blood is dominated by the aggregation and cell deformability is relatively insignificant. As the shear rate increases the size of the aggregates begins to decrease. With a further increase in shear rate, the cells will rearrange and orient to provide channels for the plasma to pass through and for the cells to slide. In this low to medium shear rate range, the cells wiggle with respect to the neighboring cells allowing flow. The influence of aggregation properties on the viscoelasticity diminish and the influence of red cell deformability begins to increase. As shear rates become large, red blood cells will stretch or deform and align with the flow. Cell layers are formed, separated by plasma, and flow is now attributed to layers of cells sliding on layers of plasma. The cell layer allows for easier flow of blood and as such there is a reduced viscosity and reduced elasticity. The viscoelasticity of the blood is dominated by the deformability of the red blood cells.

=== Maxwell model ===
Maxwell Model concerns Maxwell fluids or Maxwell material. The material in Maxwell Model is a fluid which means it respects continuity properties for conservative equations : Fluids are a subset of the phases of matter and include liquids, gases, plasmas and, to some extent, plastic solids. Maxwell model is made to estimate local conservative values of viscoelasticity by a global measure in the integral volume of the model to be transposed to different flow situations. Blood is a complex material where different cells like red blood cells are discontinuous in plasma. Their size and shape are irregular too because they are not perfect spheres. Complicating moreover blood volume shape, red cells are not identically distributed in a blood sample volume because they migrate with velocity gradients in direction to the highest speed areas calling the famous representation of the Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect, aggregate or separate in sheath or plug flows described by Thurston. Typically, the Maxwell Model described below is uniformly considering the material (uniform blue color) as a perfect distributed particles fluid everywhere in the volume (in blue) but Thurston reveals that packs of red cells, plugs, are more present in the high speed region, if &quot;y&quot; is the height direction in the Maxwell model figure, (&quot;y&quot;~H) and there is a free cells layer in the lower speed area (&quot;y&quot;~0) what means the plasma fluid phase that deforms under Maxwell Model is strained following inner linings that completely escape from the analytical model by Maxwell.

In theory, a fluid in a Maxwell Model behaves exactly similarly in any other flow geometry like pipes, rotating cells or in rest state. But in practice, blood properties vary with the geometry and blood has shown being an inadequate material to be studied as a fluid in common sense. So Maxwell Model gives trends that have to be completed in real situation followed by Thurston model in a vessel regarding distribution of cells in sheath and plug flows.

If a small cubical volume of blood is considered, with forces being acted upon it by the heart pumping and shear forces from boundaries. The change in shape of the cube will have 2 components:
* Elastic deformation which is recoverable and is stored in the structure of the blood.
* Slippage which is associated with a continuous input of viscous energy.
When the force is removed, the cube would recover partially. The elastic deformation is reversed but the slippage is not. This explains why the elastic portion is only noticeable in unsteady flow. In steady flow, the slippage will continue to increase and the measurements of non time varying force will neglect the contributions of the elasticity.

Figure 1 can be used to calculate the following parameters necessary for the evaluation of blood when a force is exerted.
:::Shear Stress: formula_5

:::Shear Strain: formula_6

:::Shear Rate: formula_7

A sinusoidal time varying flow is used to simulate the pulsation of a heart. A viscoelastic material subjected to a time varying flow will result in a phase variation between formula_8 and formula_9 represented by formula_10. If formula_11, the material is a purely elastic because the stress and strain are in phase, so that the response of one caused by the other is immediate. If formula_10 = 90°, the material is a purely viscous because strain lags behind stress by 90 degrees. A viscoelastic material will be somewhere in between 0 and 90 degrees.

The sinusoidal time variation is proportional to formula_13. Therefore, the size and phase relation between the stress, strain, and shear rate are described using this relationship and a radian frequency, formula_14 were formula_15 is the frequency in Hertz.

:::Shear Stress: formula_16

:::Shear Strain: formula_17

:::Shear Rate: formula_18
The components of the complex shear stress can be written as:
:::formula_19
Where formula_20 is the viscous stress and formula_21 is the elastic stress.
The complex coefficient of viscosity formula_22 can be found by taking the ratio of the complex shear stress and the complex shear rate:

:::formula_23

Similarly, the complex dynamic modulus G can be obtained by taking the ratio of the complex shear stress to the complex shear strain.

:::formula_24

Relating the equations to common viscoelastic terms we get the storage modulus, G&#x27;, and the loss modulus, G&quot;.

:::formula_25

A viscoelastic Maxwell material model is commonly used to represent the viscoelastic properties of blood. It uses purely viscous damper and a purely elastic spring connected in series. Analysis of this model gives the complex viscosity in terms of the dashpot constant and the spring constant.

:::formula_26

=== Oldroyd-B model ===

One of the most frequently used constitutive models for the viscoelasticity of blood is the Oldroyd-B model. There are several variations of the Oldroyd-B non-Newtonian model characterizing shear thinning behavior due to red blood cell aggregation and dispersion at low shear rate. Here we consider a three-dimensional Oldroyd-B model coupled with the momentum equation and the total stress tensor. A non Newtonian flow is used which insures that the viscosity of blood formula_27 is a function of vessel diameter d and hematocrit h. In the Oldroyd-B model, the relation between the shear stress tensor B and the orientation stress tensor A is given by:

formula_28

where D/Dt is the material derivative, V is the velocity of the fluid, C1, C2, g, formula_9 are constants. S and B are defined as follows:

:::formula_30

:::formula_31

=== Viscoelasticity of red blood cells ===

Red blood cells are subjected to intense mechanical stimulation from both blood flow and vessel walls, and their rheological properties are important to their effectiveness in performing their biological functions in the microcirculation. Red blood cells by themselves have been shown to exhibit viscoelastic properties. There are several methods used to explore the mechanical properties of red blood cells such as:
::* micropipette aspiration
::* micro indentation
::* optical tweezers
::* high frequency electrical deformation tests
These methods worked to characterize the deformability of the red blood cell in terms of the shear, bending, area expansion moduli, and relaxation times. However, they were not able to explore the viscoelastic properties. Other techniques have been implemented such as photoacoustic measurements. This technique uses a single-pulse laser beam to generate a photoacoustic signal in tissues and the decay time for the signal is measured. According to the theory of linear viscoelasticity, the decay time is equal to the viscosity-elasticity ratio and therefore the viscoelasticity characteristics of the red blood cells could be obtained.

Another experimental technique used to evaluate viscoelasticity consisted of using Ferromagnetism beads bonded to a cells surface. Forces are then applied to the magnetic bead using optical magnetic twisting cytometry which allowed researchers to explore the time dependent responses of red blood cells.

formula_32 is the mechanical torque per unit bead volume (units of stress) and is given by:
:::formula_33
where H is the applied magnetic twisting field, formula_34 is the angle of the bead’s magnetic moment relative to the original magnetization direction, and c is the bead constant which is found by experiments conducted by placing the bead in a fluid of known viscosity and applying a twisting field.

Complex Dynamic modulus G can be used to represent the relations between the oscillating stress and strain:
:::formula_25
where formula_36 is the &quot;storage modulus&quot; and formula_37 is the &quot;loss modulus&quot;:
:::formula_38

:::formula_39
where formula_40 and formula_41 are the amplitudes of stress and strain and formula_10 is the phase shift between them.
From the above relations, the components of the complex modulus are determined from a loop that is created by comparing the change in torque with the change in time which forms a loop when represented graphically. The limits of formula_32 - d(t) loop and the area, A, bounded by the formula_32 - d(t) loop, which represents the energy dissipation per cycle, are used in the calculations. The phase angle formula_10, storage modulus G&#x27;, and loss modulus G&quot; then become:
:::formula_46

:::formula_47

:::formula_48
where d is the displacement.

The hysteresis shown in figure 3 represents the viscoelasticity present in red blood cells. It is unclear if this is related to membrane molecular fluctuations or metabolic activity controlled by intracellular concentrations of ATP. Further research is needed to fully explore these interaction and to shed light on the underlying viscoelastic deformation characteristics of the red blood cells.

=== Effects of blood vessels ===
When looking at viscoelastic behavior of blood in vivo, it is necessary to also consider the effects of arteries, capillaries, and veins. The viscosity of blood has a primary influence on flow in the larger arteries, while the elasticity, which resides in the elastic deformability of red blood cells, has primary influence in the arterioles and the capillaries. Understanding wave propagation in arterial walls, local hemodynamics, and wall shear stress gradient is important in understanding the mechanisms of cardiovascular function. Arterial walls are anisotropic and heterogeneous, composed of layers with different bio-mechanical characteristics which makes understanding the mechanical influences that arteries contribute to blood flow very difficult.

=== Medical reasons for a better understanding ===
From a medical standpoint, the importance of studying the viscoelastic properties of blood becomes evident. With the development of cardiovascular prosthetic devices such as heart valves and blood pumps, the understanding of pulsating blood flow in complex geometries is required. A few specific examples are the effects of viscoelasticity of blood and its implications for the testing of a pulsatile Blood Pumps. Strong correlations between blood viscoelasticity and regional and global cerebral blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass have been documented.

This has also led the way for developing a blood analog in order to study and test prosthetic devices. The classic analog of glycerin and water provides a good representation of viscosity and inertial effects but lacks the elastic properties of real blood. One such blood analog is an aqueous solution of Xanthan gum and glycerin developed to match both the viscous and elastic components of the complex viscosity of blood.

Normal red blood cells are deformable but many conditions, such as sickle cell disease, reduce their elasticity which makes them less deformable. Red blood cells with reduced deformability have increasing impedance to flow, leading to an increase in red blood cell aggregation and reduction in oxygen saturation which can lead to further complications. The presence of cells with diminished deformability, as is the case in sickle cell disease, tends to inhibit the formation of plasma layers and by measuring the viscoelasticity, the degree of inhibition can be quantified.

=== History ===

In early theoretical work, blood was treated as a non-Newtonian viscous fluid. Initial studies had evaluated blood during steady flow and later, using oscillating flow. Professor George B. Thurston, of the University of Texas, first presented the idea of blood being viscoelastic in 1972. The previous studies that looked at blood in steady flow showed negligible elastic properties because the elastic regime is stored in the blood during flow initiation and so its presence is hidden when a flow reaches steady state. The early studies used the properties found in steady flow to derive properties for unsteady flow situations. Advancements in medical procedures and devices required a better understanding of the mechanical properties of blood.

==Constitutive equations==

The relationships between shear stress and shear rate for blood must be determined experimentally and expressed by constitutive equations. Given the complex macro-rheological behavior of blood, it is not surprising that a single equation fails to completely describe the effects of various rheological variables (e.g., hematocrit, shear rate). Thus, several approaches to defining these equations exist, with some the result of curve-fitting experimental data and others based on a particular rheological model.
* Newtonian fluid model where has a constant viscosity at all shear rates. This approach is valid for high shear rates (formula_49) where the vessel diameter is much bigger than the blood cells.
* Bingham fluid model takes into account the aggregation of red blood cells at low shear rates. Therefore, it acts as an elastic solid under threshold level of shear stress, known as yield stress.
* Einstein model where η0 is the suspending fluid Newtonian viscosity, &quot;k&quot; is a constant dependent on particle shape, and H is the volume fraction of the suspension occupied by particles. This equation is applicable for suspensions having a low volume fraction of particles. Einstein showed k=2.5 for spherical particles.
:formula_50
* Casson model where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are constants; at very low shear rates, b is the yield shear stress. However, for blood, the experimental data can not be fit over all shear rates with only one set of constants &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, whereas fairly good fit is possible by applying the equation over several shear rate ranges and thereby obtaining several sets of constants.
:formula_51
* Quemada model where k0, k∞ and γc are constants. This equation accurately fits blood data over a very wide range of shear rates.
:formula_52
:formula_53

==Other characteristics==

===The Fåhraeus effect===
The finding that, for blood flowing steadily in tubes with diameters of less than 300 micrometres, the average hematocrit of the blood in the tube is less than the hematocrit of the blood in the reservoir feeding the tube is known as the Fåhræus effect. This effect is generated in the concentration entrance length of the tube, in which erythrocytes move towards the central region of the tube as they flow downstream. This entrance length is estimated to be about the distance that the blood travels in a quarter of a second for blood where red blood cell aggregation is negligible and the vessel diameter is greater than about 20 micrometres.

===The Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect===
As the characteristic dimension of a flow channel approaches the size of the particles in a suspension; one should expect that the simple continuum model of the suspension will fail to be applicable. Often, this limit of the applicability of the continuum model begins to manifest itself at characteristic channel dimensions that are about 30 times the particle diameter: in the case of blood with a characteristic RBC dimension of 8 μm, an apparent failure occurs at about 300 micrometres. This was demonstrated by Fåhraeus and Lindqvist, who found that the apparent viscosity of blood was a function of tube diameter for diameters of 300 micrometres and less when they flowed constant-hematocrit blood from a well-stirred reservoir through a tube. The finding that for small tubes with diameters below about 300 micrometres and for faster flow rates which do not allow appreciable erythrocyte aggregation, the effective viscosity of the blood depends on tube diameter is known as the Fåhræus–Lindqvist effect.

<text>A Schottky barrier, named after Walter H. Schottky, is a potential energy barrier for electrons formed at a metal–semiconductor junction. Schottky barriers have rectifying characteristics, suitable for use as a diode. One of the primary characteristics of a Schottky barrier is the Schottky barrier height, denoted by ΦB (see figure). The value of ΦB depends on the combination of metal and semiconductor.

Not all metal–semiconductor junctions form a rectifying Schottky barrier; a metal–semiconductor junction that conducts current in both directions without rectification, perhaps due to its Schottky barrier being too low, is called an ohmic contact.

== Physics of formation ==
When a metal is put in direct contact with a semiconductor, a so called Schottky barrier can be formed, leading to a rectifying behavior of the electrical contact. This happens both when the semiconductor is n-type and its work function is smaller than the work function of the metal, and when the semiconductor is p-type and the opposite relation between work functions holds.

At the basis of the description of the Schottky barrier formation through the band diagram formalism, there are three main assumptions:

# The contact between the metal and the semiconductor must be intimate and without the presence of any other material layer (such as an oxide).
# No interdiffusion of the metal and the semiconductor is taken into account.
# There are no impurities at the interface between the two materials.

To a first approximation, the barrier between a metal and a semiconductor is predicted by the Schottky–Mott rule to be proportional to the difference of the metal-vacuum work function and the semiconductor-vacuum electron affinity. For an isolated metal, the work function formula_1 is defined as the difference between its vacuum energy formula_2 (i.e. the minimum energy that an electron must possess to completely free itself from the material) and the Fermi energy formula_3, and it is an invariant property of the specified metal:

formula_4

On the other hand, the work function of a semiconductor is defined as:

formula_5

Where formula_6 is the electron affinity (i.e. the difference between the vacuum energy and the bottom energy formula_7 of the conduction band). It is valuable to describe the work function of the semiconductor in terms of its electron affinity since this last one is an invariant fundamental property of the semiconductor, while the difference between the conduction band and the Fermi energy depends on the doping.
When the two isolated materials are put into intimate contact, the equalization of the Fermi levels brings to the movement of charge from one material to the other, depending on the values of the work functions. This leads to the creation of an energy barrier, since at the interface between the materials some charge get collected. For electrons, the barrier height formula_8can be easily calculated as the difference between the metal work function and the electron affinity of the semiconductor:

formula_9

While the barrier height for holes is equal to the difference between the energy gap of the semiconductor and the energy barrier for electrons:

formula_10

In reality, what can happen is that charged interface states can pin the Fermi level at a certain energy value no matter the work function values, influencing the barrier height for both carriers. This is due to the fact that the chemical termination of the semiconductor crystal against a metal creates electron states within its band gap. The nature of these metal-induced gap states and their occupation by electrons tends to pin the center of the band gap to the Fermi level, an effect known as Fermi level pinning. Thus the heights of the Schottky barriers in metal–semiconductor contacts often show little dependence on the value of the semiconductor or metal work functions, in strong contrast to the Schottky–Mott rule. Different semiconductors exhibit this Fermi level pinning to different degrees, but a technological consequence is that ohmic contacts are usually difficult to form in important semiconductors such as silicon and gallium arsenide. Non-ohmic contacts present a parasitic resistance to current flow that consumes energy and lowers device performance.

== Rectifying properties ==
In a rectifying Schottky barrier, the barrier is high enough that there is a depletion region in the semiconductor, near the interface.
This gives the barrier a high resistance when small voltage biases are applied to it. Under large voltage bias, the electric current flowing through the barrier is essentially governed by the laws of thermionic emission, combined with the fact that the Schottky barrier is fixed relative to the metal&#x27;s Fermi level.

* Under forward bias, there are many thermally excited electrons in the semiconductor that are able to pass over the barrier. The passage of these electrons over the barrier (without any electrons coming back) corresponds to a current in the opposite direction. The current rises very rapidly with bias, however at high biases the series resistance of the semiconductor can start to limit the current.
* Under reverse bias, there is a small leakage current as some thermally excited electrons in the metal have enough energy to surmount the barrier. To first approximation this current should be constant (as in the Shockley diode equation); however, current rises gradually with reverse bias due to a weak barrier lowering (similar to the vacuum Schottky effect). At very high biases, the depletion region breaks down.

&quot;Note: the discussion above is for a Schottky barrier to an &quot;n&quot;-type semiconductor; similar considerations apply for a &quot;p&quot;-type semiconductor.&quot;

The current-voltage relationship is qualitatively the same as with a p-n junction, however the physical process is somewhat different.

=== Conduction values ===
The thermionic emission can be formulated as following:

formula_11

While the tunneling current density can be expressed, for a triangular shaped barrier (considering WKB approximation) as:

formula_12

From both formulae it is clear that the current contributions are related to the barrier height for both electrons and holes. If a symmetric current profile for both n and p carriers is then needed, the barrier height must be ideally identical for electrons and holes.

=== Minority carrier injection ===
For very high Schottky barriers where ΦB is a significant fraction of the band gap of the semiconductor, the forward bias current may instead be carried &quot;underneath&quot; the Schottky barrier, as minority carriers in the semiconductor.

An example of this is seen in the Point-contact transistor.

== Devices ==
A Schottky diode is a single metal–semiconductor junction, used for its rectifying properties. Schottky diodes are often the most suitable kind of diode when a low forward voltage drop is desired, such as in a high-efficiency DC power supply. Also, because of their majority-carrier conduction mechanism, Schottky diodes can achieve greater switching speeds than p–n junction diodes, making them appropriate to rectify high-frequency signals.

Introducing a second semiconductor/metal interface and a gate stack overlapping both junctions, one can obtain a Schottky barrier field effect transistor (SB-FET). The gate steers the carrier injection inside the channel modulating the band bending at the interface, and thus the resistance of the Schottky barriers. Generally the most significantly resistive path for the current is represented by the Schottky barriers, and so the channel itself does not contribute significantly to the conduction when the transistor is turned on. This kind of device has an ambipolar behavior since when a positive voltage is applied to both junctions, their band diagram is bent downwards enabling an electron current from source to drain (the presence of a formula_13 voltage is always implied) due to direct tunneling. In the opposite case of a negative voltage applied to both junctions the band diagram is bent upwards and holes can be injected and flow from the drain to the source. Setting the gate voltage to 0 V suppresses the tunneling current and enables only a lower current due to thermionic events. One of the main limitations of such a device is strongly related to the presence of this current that makes it difficult to properly switch it off. A clear advantage of such a device is that there is no need for channel doping and expensive technological steps like ion implantation and high temperature annealings can be avoided, keeping the thermal budget low. However the band bending due to the voltage difference between drain and gate often injects enough carriers to make impossible a proper switch off of the device. Also, low on-currents due to the intrinsic resistance of the Schottky contacts are typical of this kind of device just like a very hard and unreliable scalability due to the difficult control of the junction area.

A bipolar junction transistor with a Schottky barrier between the base and the collector is known as a Schottky transistor. Because the junction voltage of the Schottky barrier is small, the transistor is prevented from saturating, which improves the speed when used as a switch. This is the basis for the Schottky and Advanced Schottky TTL families, as well as their low power variants.

A MESFET or metal–semiconductor FET uses a reverse-biased Schottky barrier to provide a depletion region that pinches off a conducting channel buried inside the semiconductor (similar to the JFET where instead a p–n junction provides the depletion region). A variant of this device is the high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT), which also utilizes a heterojunction to provide a device with extremely high conductance.

A Schottky barrier carbon nanotube FET uses the non-ideal contact between a metal and a carbon nanotube to form a Schottky barrier that can be used to make extremely small Schottky diodes, transistors, and similar electronic devices with unique mechanical and electronic properties.

Schottky barriers can also be used to characterize a semiconductor. In the depletion region of the Schottky barrier, dopants remain ionized and give rise to a &quot;space charge&quot; which in turn give rise to a capacitance of the junction. The metal–semiconductor interface and the opposite boundary of the depleted area act like two capacitor plates, with the depletion region acting as a dielectric. By applying a voltage to the junction it is possible to vary the depletion width and vary the capacitance, used in capacitance voltage profiling. By analyzing the &quot;speed&quot; at which the capacitance responds to changes in voltage, it is possible to obtain information about dopants and other defects, a technique known as deep-level transient spectroscopy.

<text>Rottumerplaat () is one of the three islands that make up Rottum in the West Frisian Islands. The island is located in the North Sea off the Dutch coast. It is situated between the shoal Simonszand and the island Rottumeroog. Rottumerplaat started as a shoal in the 1830s. It continued to grow into an island after 1950, when a &quot;stuifdijk&quot;, a wind-blown dike, was constructed by Rijkswaterstaat, because there were plans to use Rottumerplaat as a work island for the reclamation of the Wadden Sea. 

In 1959, the Boschplaat merged with Rottumerplaat. Sediment deposition has caused the island to become significantly larger in recent years. Access to the island is prohibited since Rottumerplaat is a resting and forage area for numerous bird species. Rijkswaterstaat and Staatsbosbeheer are responsible for the administration of the island. Rottumerplaat is the northernmost point of the Netherlands.

==Fauna==
Rottumerplaat is a resting and forage area for sanderling, dunlin and Kentish plovers. Common eider, common shelduck, Arctic tern, common tern, little tern, Kentish plover, and ringed plover nest on the island. From 1996 the Sandwich tern nested on Rottumerplaat, but has since stopped doing so.

==Godfried Bomans and Jan Wolkers==
In 1971 writers Jan Wolkers and Godfried Bomans each spent a week on the island. Their only connection with the outside world was a short daily radio relay with VARA radio presenter Willem Ruis, who stayed at a hotel in nearby Warffum. The interviews were broadcast as a radio programme, &quot;Alone On An Island&quot;. For Godfried Bomans, the stay on the island was a disaster; he could not cope with the noise the many seagulls made and he was troubled by loneliness. Jan Wolkers however experienced his stay on the island as an adventure and kept himself alive by catching shrimps and eel, and boiling sea sandwort. He also rescued a young seal. Both authors published a book about their stay on the island.

<text>A derby ( , ) is a type of horse race named after the Derby Stakes run at Epsom Downs Racecourse in England. That was in turn named after Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby, who inaugurated the race in 1780. Perhaps the best-known example after the original is the Kentucky Derby in the United States.

Traditionally, the term &quot;derby&quot; is used strictly to refer to races restricted to three-year-olds, as the English and U.S. Triple Crown races all are. The most notable exceptions to this rule are the Hong Kong Derby and Singapore Derby, restricted to four-year-old Thoroughbreds, and the Canadian Pacing Derby, an annual harness race for &quot;aged pacers&quot; (Standardbreds) four years old and up.

In Scandinavian harness racing Derby is restricted to four-year-olds. Exception is the Finnhorse Derby, which is restricted to five-year-olds.

<doc id="512587" wikidata="Q1665857" url="?curid=512587" title="IDL (programming language)">
<text>IDL, short for Interactive Data Language, is a programming language used for data analysis. It is popular in particular areas of science, such as astronomy, atmospheric physics and medical imaging. IDL shares a common syntax with PV-Wave and originated from the same codebase, though the languages have subsequently diverged in detail. There are also free or costless implementations, such as GNU Data Language (GDL) and Fawlty Language (FL).

==Overview==
IDL is vectorized, numerical, and interactive, and is commonly used for interactive processing of large amounts of data (including image processing). The syntax includes many constructs from Fortran and some from C.

IDL originated from early VMS Fortran, and its syntax still shows its heritage:

 x = findgen(100)/10
 y = sin(x)/x
 plot,x,y

The function in the above example returns a one-dimensional array of floating point numbers, with values equal to a series of integers starting at 0.

Note that the operation in the second line applies in a vectorized manner to the whole 100-element array created in the first line, analogous to the way general-purpose array programming languages (such as APL, J or K) would do it. This example contains a division by zero; IDL will report an arithmetic overflow, and store a NaN value in the corresponding element of the array (the first one), but the other array elements will be finite. The NaN is excluded from the visualization generated by the command.

As with most other array programming languages, IDL is very fast at doing vector operations (sometimes as fast as a well-coded custom loop in Fortran or C) but quite slow if elements need processing individually. Hence part of the art of using IDL (or any other array programming language, for that matter) for numerically heavy computations is to make use of the built-in vector operations.

==History==

The predecessor versions of IDL were developed in the 1970s at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) at the University of Colorado at Boulder. At LASP, David Stern was involved in efforts to allow scientists to test hypotheses without employing programmers to write or modify individual applications. The first program in the evolutionary chain to IDL that Stern developed was named Rufus; it was a simple vector-oriented calculator that ran on the PDP-12. It accepted two-letter codes that specified an arithmetic operation, the input registers to serve as operands, and the destination register. A version of Rufus developed on the PDP-8 was the Mars Mariner Spectrum Editor (MMED). MMED was used by LASP scientists to interpret data from Mariner 7 and Mariner 9. Later, Stern wrote a program named SOL, which also ran on the PDP-8. Unlike its predecessors, it was a true programming language with a FORTRAN-like syntax. SOL was an array-oriented language with some primitive graphics capabilities.

Stern left LASP to found Research Systems Inc. (RSI) in 1977. The first RSI product was IDL for the PDP-11. In this release, the graphics supported by IDL were primarily Tektronix terminals and raster graphics displays. RSI sold its first IDL licenses to NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center and Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp. in 1979. Two years later RSI released an initial VAX/VMS version of IDL, which was written in VAX MACRO and FORTRAN. It took advantage of the VAX virtual memory and 32-bit address space. The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the University of Michigan, the University of Colorado, and the Naval Research Laboratory started to use IDL with this version.

In 1987 RSI shifted development work of IDL to the Unix environment, which required a complete re-write of the code in C rather than a port of the existing version of VAX IDL. Stern and Ali Bahrami rewrote IDL for Unix on the Sun 3, taking advantage of the re-write to extend and improve the language. Subsequently, IDL was further expanded and ported to several variants of Unix, VMS, Linux, Microsoft Windows (1992), and Mac OS (1994).

Widgets were added to IDL in 1992, providing event-driven programming with graphical user interfaces. In 1997 ION (IDL On the Net), a web server-based system, was commercially released. The first version of ENVI, an application for remote sensing multispectral and hyperspectral image analysis written in IDL, was released in 1994. ENVI was created, developed and owned by Better Solutions Consulting, LLC, until it was purchased from BSC in October 2000 by Eastman Kodak coincident with their purchase of RSI. RSI sold, marketed and supported ENVI under the terms of a license agreement with BSC, LLC from 1994 through October 2000. New object and pointer types, and limited object-oriented programming capabilities, were added to IDL in 1997.

IDL has been applied widely in space science, for example in solar physics. The European Space Agency used IDL to process almost all of the pictures of Halley&#x27;s Comet taken by the Giotto spacecraft. The team repairing the Hubble Space Telescope used IDL to help them diagnose anomalies in the main mirror. In 1995, astronauts on board a Space Shuttle used IDL loaded on a laptop to study ultraviolet radiation. Currently, amongst other applications, IDL is being used for most of the analysis of the SECCHI part of the STEREO mission at NRL, USA, and at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK.

RSI became a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Industries in March 2004. As of 15 May 2006, RSI began doing business as ITT Visual Information Solutions. Effective 31 October 2011, as a result of restructuring, that company became Exelis Visual Information Solutions. In 2015, IDL was purchased by Harris Geospatial Solutions which later became L3Harris Geospatial Solutions. In April 2023, IDL was acquired by NV5 Geospatial.

==Features==
As a computer language, IDL: 
* is dynamically typed.
* has separate namespaces for variables, functions and procedures, but no namespace hierarchy.
* was originally single threaded but now has many multi-threaded functions and procedures.
* has all function arguments passed by reference; but see &quot;problems&quot;, below.
* has named parameters called keywords which are passed by reference.
* provides named parameter inheritance in nested routine calls, by reference or value.
* does not require variables to be predeclared.
* provides COMMON block declarations and system variables to share global values among routines.
* provides a basic form of object-oriented programming, somewhat similar to Smalltalk, along with operator overloading.
* implements a persistent, global heap of pointer and object variables, using reference counting for garbage collection.
* compiles to an interpreted, stack-based intermediate p-code (à la Java virtual machine).
* provides a simple and efficient index slice syntax to extract data from large arrays.
* provides various integer sizes, as well as single and double precision floating point real and complex numbers.
* provides composite data types such as character strings, homogeneous-type arrays, lists, hash tables, and simple (non-hierarchical) record structures of mixed data types.

==Problems==

Some of these features, which make IDL very simple to use interactively, also cause difficulties when building large programs. The single namespace is particularly problematic; for example, language updates that include new built-in functions have on occasion invalidated large scientific libraries.

Arrays are passed by reference, and this mechanism is an advertised feature of the language to pass data back out of a subroutine – in contrast, array slices are copied before being passed, so that data modifications do not flow back into array ranges (after the subroutine exits), violating the principle of least surprise.

Many historical irregularities survive from the early heritage of the language, requiring individual workarounds by the programmer. As an example:

* Array indexing and subroutine entry can both be carried out with exactly the same syntax (parentheses); this ambiguity, coupled with the single namespace for all variables and subroutines, can cause code to stop working when newly defined subroutines or language extensions conflict with local variable names. IDL programmers can avoid many of these problems by using square brackets for array indexing, thereby avoiding conflicts with function names which use parentheses.

The preceding issue can be alleviated using this compiler option:

 COMPILE_OPT STRICTARR

ITT Visual Information Solutions (ITT VIS), the developers of IDL, have taken explicit steps to prevent bytecode compatibility with other environments. Files containing compiled routines use a binary tagged-data-structure format that has not been officially published but has been investigated and documented by users but also contain the following notice as ASCII text embedded within each saved file: 

 IDL Save/Restore files embody unpublished proprietary information about the IDL program. Reverse engineering of this file is therefore forbidden under the terms of the IDL End User License Agreement (IDL EULA). All IDL users are required to read and agree to the terms of the IDL EULA at the time that they install IDL. Software that reads or writes files in the IDL Save/Restore format must have a license from NV5 Geospatial Solutions, Inc. explicitly granting the right to do so. In this case, the license will be included with the software for your inspection. Please report software that does not have such a license to your account manager or sales representative.

, the statement has not been tested in a court of law.
Also, that provision of the IDL EULA has no effect in Australia, as a result of sections 47D and 47H of that country&#x27;s Copyright Act.

<doc id="512600" wikidata="Q4877685" url="?curid=512600" title="Beautiful Circle">
<text>Beautiful Circle is the second studio album by Australian country music singer Sara Storer. It was released in November 2002.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 2003, the album was nominated for Best Country Album, losing to &quot;Golden Road&quot; by Keith Urban.

At the Country Music Awards of Australia in 2004, Storer received eight nominations and won seven awards, including Album of the Year and Female Vocalist of the Year.

==Making of the album==
It was recorded in the second half of 2002 with Garth Porter at the controls. The first single &quot;Raining on the Plains&quot; was written by Storer&#x27;s brother Doug Storer who lives near Gulargambone, New South Wales on a property facing the Warrumbungles. Sara Storer and Garth Porter also received songwriting credits for the track. It was sung as a duet with John Williamson. 

In January 2004, she recorded a DVD called &quot;Stories to Tell&quot; on a family property near Dubbo where she tells the stories behind her songs. It was released as a bonus to the album in April 2004 and was also available separately.

==Promotion==
&quot;Raining on the Plains&quot; reached number one on the country singles charts. Leading Australian radio presenter John Laws helped promote sales of the song by playing it repeatedly and she appeared on his Australia wide radio program. &quot;These Hands&quot; was also a successful single off the album. 

Storer promoted the album with extensive touring with Australian country singer Troy Cassar-Daley and British singer Charlie Landsborough. One of the highlights in her touring was playing at the Gympie Muster in Gympie, Queensland where she played to an audience over 40,000.

==Critical success==
&quot;The Age&quot; newspaper in Melbourne gave the album a five star rating describing her as &quot;a rare commodity&quot;. The UK publication &quot;Country Music People&quot; also gave her a five star review saying &quot;As we lament the death of Slim Dusty, here is evidence that authentic, yet contemporary Australian bush country has not died with his passing.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; (CVE-105) (ex-&quot;St. Joseph Bay&quot;), the lead ship of her class, was an escort carrier of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage. &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; was employed as a training ship during the war, training new crews for the other members of her class as they were completed. She saw no active service after the war ended in 1945, instead being assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, and was eventually sold for scrap in 1972.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Commencement Bay&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

== Service history ==

The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The first ship of the class was laid down on 23 September 1943 at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, originally under the name &quot;St. Joseph Bay&quot;. She was renamed &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; during construction, after the nearby Commencement Bay in Puget Sound. On 9 May 1944, the ship was launched, and after completing fitting out work, was commissioned into active service on 27 November.

On 1 February 1945, &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; moved to Seattle, Washington, where she began her active career as a training ship. She operated in this role in Puget Sound for the next nine months, during which time she trained some 545 officers and 5,053 enlisted men who went on to serve aboard &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;″s sister ships as they were completed at the Todd Pacific facilities. She also qualified 249 pilots from eight air groups for carrier operations. On 21 October, she departed Bremerton, Washington, bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving there on 4 November. She spent the next three weeks participating in carrier qualification training, and on 27 November, departed to return to Seattle. She then moved on to Tacoma soon thereafter.

Over the course of the following months, &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; sailed south to visit Los Angeles and San Pedro, California, before returning to Tacoma on 28 January. She was decommissioned there on 30 November 1946 and allocated to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so they were soon replaced by much larger s. She saw no further service, but was reclassified as a helicopter carrier with the hull number CVHE-105 on 12 June 1955. On 7 May 1959, she was reclassified again, now as an aircraft ferry with the hull number AKV-37. She lingered on in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 April 1971, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was eventually sold to ship breakers on 25 August 1972 and subsequently scrapped.

<text>USS &quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; was a &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class escort carrier of the United States Navy, in service from 5 March 1945 to 5 November 1946. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes, and due to their origin as tankers and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , had extensive fuel storage. After spending another 25 years in the reserve fleet, the ship was scrapped in 1971.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts; four of the Oerlikon guns were mounted individually, while the remaining guns were in experimental Mark 31 quadruple mounts. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was laid down under the name &quot;Willapa Bay&quot; on 10 January 1944 at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. She was renamed &quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; after the Battle of Cape Gloucester on 26 April and was launched on 12 September. The ship was commissioned on 5 March 1945. After initial working up, she moved to Pearl Harbor for combat training in preparation for her deployment to the front lines.

&quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; then sailed west to the Philippines, arriving at Leyte on 29 June. There, she joined the Third Fleet, which was operating off Okinawa during the Japan campaign. She contributed her fighter aircraft to the combat air patrol defending minesweepers clearing Japanese defensive minefields in the area from 5 to 17 July. She also used her aircraft to carry out photo-reconnaissance missions over the coast of Japanese-occupied China from late July to 7 August. Her planes shot down several Japanese aircraft during this period and assisted in damaging a cargo ship.

The ship then returned to the coast of Japan to cover minesweepers operating there following the Japanese decision to surrender. Following the end of the conflict, she helped to liberate Allied prisoners of war who had been imprisoned on Kyushu. Over the following months, she made four Operation Magic Carpet voyages between Japan and Pearl Harbor, returning American soldiers, sailors, and marines home. She received a single battle star for her short period of service during the war.

With her role in the repatriation effort over, &quot;Cape Gloucester&quot; sailed to Tacoma on 22 May 1946, where she was decommissioned and reduced to reserve status on 5 November. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced by much larger s. As part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet for more than a decade and a half, she was reclassified as a helicopter carrier with the hull number CVHE-109 on 12 June 1955. She was reclassified again on 7 May 1959 as a cargo ship and aircraft transport with the hull number AKV-9. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 April 1971 and thereafter sold to be broken up for scrap.

==Service history==

===World War II===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was originally laid down as &quot;Sunset Bay&quot; at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, on 25 October 1943. The ship was launched on 10 June 1944. While construction was still on-going on 5 July, she was renamed &quot;Block Island&quot; after the Block Island Sound, which lies between Block Island and the coast of Rhode Island. The ship was commissioned into active service on 30 December 1944. After completing final fitting out, the ship left Tacoma on 10 January for a short period of initial training in Puget Sound. She then stopped at the Puget Sound Navy Yard to take on ammunition and supplies, before departing for San Francisco, California, on 20 January. She arrived there two days later and loaded five picket boats and several damaged aircraft that were to be transported to San Diego, California. She left San Francisco on 24 January and arrived on the 26th, disembarked her cargo, and then began loading 5-inch High Velocity Aircraft Rockets.

&quot;Block Island&quot;″s first aircraft came aboard on 3 February; these were eight Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and eight Vought F4U Corsair fighters of squadron VMF-511, which formed part on Carrier Aircraft Service Division 1 (CASD). The next day, the ship went to sea to begin initial carrier operations training. The torpedo bomber squadron VMTB-233, which operated Grumman TBM Avengers, completed CASD 1 on 7 February. Three days later, the ship sailed in company with the destroyer for what was to have been ten days of combat training off San Diego. These included live-fire training for the ship&#x27;s aircraft. On 14 February, one of the ship&#x27;s aircraft suffered a mechanical breakdown and crashed, though the pilot was recovered by the seaplane tender . The weather worsened through the afternoon, and a flight of four fighters and six Avengers launched at 16:40 had to be recalled at 17:34 due to an approaching storm; only one Avenger was able to land on the carrier. The rest were redirected to the airfield on San Nicolas Island. But by the time they arrived there, the storm had reached the island. One Avenger crashed there, killing all three men aboard, as did a pair of Corairs, whose pilots also died. The flight leader attempted to land his Avenger first at San Nicolas, then at Santa Barbara, and ultimately at Bakersfield, but he also crashed before reaching the airfield, killing the three-man crew. Three other planes ditched at sea off San Nicholas, and three men were pulled from the water by Coast Guard rescue vessels. The remaining planes landed safely at San Nicolas. The incident forced the cancellation of training, as &quot;Block Island&quot; and &quot;Childs&quot; spent the next day searching for downed pilots before returning to San Diego.

&quot;Block Island&quot; thereafter resumed an intensive training schedule for the next month in preparation for deployment to the western Pacific to join the forces fighting Japan. She got underway on 20 March, bound for Pearl Harbor, carrying a load of 30 extra planes and 192 passengers in addition to her normal crew and complement of 36 planes. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 26 March and disembarked the passengers and cargo; she then spent several weeks conducting combat training off Hawaii. &quot;Block Island&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 17 April to join the fleet at its forward base at Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, in company with the destroyer . After passing through Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands on the way, the two ships arrived off Ulithi on 28 April. While approaching the atoll, they received reports of enemy aircraft approaching, and their crews observed American aircraft destroy a Nakajima B6N torpedo bomber. &quot;Block Island&quot;″s anti-aircraft gunners accidentally opened fire on two American planes, but did not shoot them down before realizing they were friendly aircraft. The two ships anchored in Ulithi later that day and became part of Fifth Fleet, centered on the Fast Carrier Task Force.

====Battle of Okinawa====

On 30 April, &quot;Block Island&quot; sortied with the destroyer and destroyer escort , bound for Okinawa, where US forces were engaged in a battle to seize the island. &quot;Block Island&quot; joined Task Unit 52.1.1, commanded by Rear Admiral Calvin Durgin, on 3 May some southeast of Okinawa. The following day, she was transferred to Task Unit 52.1.3, commanded by Rear Admiral William Sample. There, she joined the escort carriers , , and . Over the course of the next week, &quot;Block Island&quot; contributed her aircraft to the combat air patrol to introduce them to combat operations.

The ship made her first aerial attack on Japanese positions on 10 May, first sending her TBMs to drop bombs and fire rockets at a Japanese strongpoint near the town of Naha. At around 12:00, several of her fighters were sent to strafe Japanese facilities on a nearby island. Later that afternoon, her planes were rearmed and refueled for a strike on airfields in the nearby Sakishima Islands. The strike force, which consisted of eight fighters and eight TBMs, struck airfields at Hirara and Nobara, damaging airfields and related infrastructure. Japanese defensive fire shot down two of the TBMs, though one of them managed to limp back to the carrier and ditch nearby, allowing its crew to be picked up by an escorting destroyer.

The following morning, the ship&#x27;s pilots began further strikes on Japanese airfields in the Sakishima Islands, beginning with a fighter sweep over Ishigaki Island. A force of bombers and fighters then hit the airfield on Ishigaki, followed by another fighter sweep to attack any remaining opposition. Three of &quot;Block Island&quot;″s planes were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, but they were able to return to the ship. A fourth plane was forced to land at Yontan on Okinawa due to damage to its hydraulic system, along with a bomb that had come loose from its hardpoint in the plane&#x27;s bomb bay. Aircraft from the British Pacific Fleet then took over attacks on the Sakishima Islands on 11 May, allowing &quot;Block Island&quot; to return to direct operations on Okinawa itself.

&quot;Block Island&quot; remained in action off Okinawa for the next ten days as the fighting to secure the island persisted. On 22 May, the ship left for the nearby island of Kerama Retto to replenish ammunition and other supplies before returning to operations off Okinawa. These included strikes on 24 May on Shuri Castle, a major strong point of the Japanese defensive line in southern Okinawa. On the 27th, a sweep by four fighters over Ishigaki resulted in the death of VMF-511&#x27;s commander after his aircraft failed to pull out of a dive during a rocket attack on the harbor facilities there. On 29 May, the ship&#x27;s planes flew a total of 29 sorties against the airfields on Ishigaki and Miyako Island; during one raid on the former, one of the ship&#x27;s TBMs was shot down by ground fire. The ship continued to operate off Okinawa for the next three weeks, and on 16 June, one of her Hellcats was shot down over Amami Ōshima. Later that day, &quot;Block Island&quot; transferred to Carrier Division 27, becoming the flagship of Rear Admiral Dixwell Ketcham. She then sailed south to the Philippines for operations elsewhere.

====End of the war====
On 19 June, &quot;Block Island&quot; arrived in Leyte Gulf in the northern Philippines for a brief period of rest before sortieing as part of the invasion fleet for what was to be the last major amphibious assault of the Pacific War. &quot;Block Island&quot;, her sister ship , and &quot;Suwannee&quot; departed with an escort of six destroyers, bound for Balikpapan on the island of Borneo. After arriving on 30 June, the carriers&#x27; planes began air strikes on Japanese positions there to cover the Australian assault on the town that began the following day. &quot;Block Island&quot;″s pilots flew some 98 sorties over the following three days of combat operations. None of her aircraft were shot down during the fighting, and in the early hours of 3 July, one of her Hellcats shot down an Aichi E13A1 reconnaissance floatplane, which proved to be the only aerial victory claimed by the ship&#x27;s fighters during the war. Following the end of Japanese resistance in the city, &quot;Block Island&quot; and the rest of the squadron returned north to the Philippines, though &quot;Block Island&quot; soon departed for Guam for repairs to her arresting gear.

The ship was still in Apra Harbor, Guam, during the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August, respectively. She soon departed with &quot;Santee&quot; and four destroyers, bound for Leyte. The ships were still en route when their crews learned on 14 August that Japan would announce its decision to surrender the following day. At 16:30, the ships received news that the ceasefire had gone into effect. &quot;Block Island&quot; lay at Leyte from 17 to 28 August, when she departed as part of Task Group 77.1, which also included &quot;Santee&quot; and four destroyer escorts. They were to cover the minesweepers of Task Group 71.2, which were to clear mines blocking the entrance to Incheon, Korea. The ships sailed on 29 August and encountered a typhoon on the way; the storm lasted from 1 to 3 September, but the task groups avoided damage by staying to the south, near Formosa. The Allied powers learned of significant prisoner of war camps on the island during this period, and Ketcham, aboard &quot;Block Island&quot;, was ordered to send an advance team to Keelung to begin the process of liberating the camps. &quot;Block Island&quot; sent a group of 33 marines and a medical team aboard the destroyer escorts and to Keelung.

Before the marines arrived, Ketcham prepared leaflets announcing the American forces that would be landing at Keelung, along with instructions for the Japanese garrison to begin preparing to evacuate the POWs. Several Corsairs were sent to drop the leaflets in Keelung and the airfield at Matsuyama on the morning of 5 September. Later that morning, Ketcham sent a TBM Avenger from &quot;Block Island&quot; to land at Matsuyama and make direct contact with the local commander. Marine Major Peter Folger ordered the commander to take him to the local camps so he could evaluate the situation and coordinate the relief effort. Aircraft carrying medicine and food were soon sent to Matsuyama, with orders conveyed between Folger and &quot;Block Island&quot; by one of her Hellcats, which orbited over the camps to relay radio messages. The planes flew in some of supplies and the marine colonel who arrived with the landing party commandeered a train to carry the more than 1,000 POWs from the camps back to Keelung. There, they were taken aboard &quot;Thomas J. Gary&quot; and &quot;Kretchmer&quot;, which took the men back to the rest of the squadron. Space aboard &quot;Block Island&quot; was cleared for over 600 cots and fresh clothing and bedding was assembled. The ship&#x27;s hangar deck was converted into a hospital for the former POWs who were in more serious condition. In total, more than 1,200 men were rescued from the camps; they were distributed between the ships of the group, and &quot;Block Island&quot; took 474 aboard. The ships sailed south on the morning of 6 September to take the men back to the Philippines. While en route, they met a British carrier task force that replaced them off Formosa to patrol over the camps, as there were still men who had to be left behind, as they were judged to be too sick for the voyage. &quot;Block Island&quot; arrived in Manila in the Philippines on 8 September and began transferring the men to shore.

&quot;Block Island&quot; left the Philippines on 17 September, bound for Okinawa, where she arrived three days later. She then joined a naval force sent to cover the landing of the Chinese Nationalist Army&#x27;s 70th Army as they landed on the island at Keelung to retake control of Formosa from the defeated Japanese. These operations took place on 16 and 17 October. The ship then sailed for Saipan in the Mariana Islands, arriving there on 23 October. From there, she sailed to Guam, where she embarked passengers and aircraft that were no longer needed in the central Pacific, and departed for the United States. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on 2 December, before proceeding on to San Diego on 5 December. The ship reached her destination six days later, her role in the immediate postwar operations complete. For her service during the war, &quot;Block Island&quot; received two battle stars.

===Post-War===
On 5 January 1946, &quot;Block Island&quot; left San Diego for the last time, bound for the East Coast of the United States by way of the Panama Canal. She arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 20 January. For the next few months, she made cruises north to New York City and south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after which she served as a training ship for naval recruits off the coast of Virginia. She was placed in reserve, but still in commission, on 28 May at Portsmouth, Virginia. She was soon moved to Norfolk, and then on 7 June sailed to Annapolis, Maryland. There, she resumed training duties, but for cadets at the United States Naval Academy.

Following the outbreak of the Korean War in mid-1950, the Navy badly needed operational warships, and so &quot;Block Island&quot;″s career as a cadet training ship came to an end on 3 October 1950, when she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was placed out of commission to be overhauled at Norfolk in preparation for active service. On 25 October, she was moved to Philadelphia for further modifications. The work was completed by early 1951, and she was recommissioned on 28 April. The ship then underwent a lengthy fitting out period, and she finally went to sea on 5 January 1952 on a cruise to Guantanamo Bay. There, she took part in flight operations training that lasted until mid-March. Further training off the Virginia Capes followed, and in late April she took another cruise in the Caribbean that concluded on 27 April. She spent the rest of the year operating out of Norfolk.

On 5 January 1953, &quot;Block Island&quot; departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, bound for another training cruise to the West Indies that lasted more than a month. She then sailed north to the New York Naval Shipyard on 25 February for periodic maintenance. The ship then returned to Virginia for flight training exercises that lasted until mid-April. This was followed by a cruise to western Europe that began on 17 April. She visited several ports in the United Kingdom and then entered the Mediterranean Sea to visit Golfe-Juan, France, and Naples, Italy. She cruised in the Mediterranean before returning to Norfolk in late June. Later that year, &quot;Block Island&quot; embarked on another cruise in the Caribbean, Sikorsky HO4S helicopters assigned to the helicopter squadron HS-3. Following the cruise, the ship returned to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 15 January 1954, where she was decommissioned on 27 August. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive.

On 22 December 1957, she was redesignated as an amphibious assault ship with the hull number LPH-1, in anticipation of conversion under project SCB 159 to an amphibious assault ship. The program represented the culmination of Marine Corps tests through the late 1940s and 1950s using helicopters as a component of their &quot;vertical assault&quot; doctrine, which envisioned using helicopter-borne troops to seize strategic crossroads behind the lines while traditional amphibious forces went ashore. Work on &quot;Block Island&quot; began in January 1958, but by this time, the remaining &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers that had not been converted to SCB-27 configuration had become available for use as amphibious assault ships. As a result, the project was cancelled before it was completed, and her designation reverted to CVE-106 in June. The ship was reclassified again on 7 May 1959, this time as a cargo ship and aircraft transport with the hull number AKV-38. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July, an was sold soon thereafter to the Japanese firm Kowa Koeki, based in Tokyo. The ship was towed to Japan and broken up in mid-1960.

<doc id="512615" wikidata="Q1425455" url="?curid=512615" title="Handley Page Type O">
<text>The Handley Page Type O was a biplane bomber used by Britain during the First World War. When built, the Type O was one of the largest aircraft in the world. There were two main variants, the Handley Page O/100 (H.P.11) and the Handley Page O/400 (H.P.12).

The aircraft were used in France for tactical night attacks on targets in German-occupied France and Belgium and for strategic bombing of industrial and transport targets in the Rhineland. Some aircraft were temporarily diverted to anti-submarine reconnaissance and bombing in the Tees estuary in 1917 and two aircraft operated in the eastern Mediterranean. The Type O made such an impression that for many years after the war any large aircraft in Britain was referred to as a &quot;Handley Page&quot;, even getting a dictionary entry.

==Design==

Design work began shortly after the start of the First World War following meetings between Captain Murray Sueter, the director of the Air Department of the Royal Navy, and Frederick Handley Page. Sueter requested &quot;a bloody paralyser of an aircraft&quot; for long-range bombing. The phrase was originated by Commander Charles Rumney Samson, who had recently returned from the front. Coastal patrol adaptations of the abortive Handley Page L/200, M/200 and MS/200 designs were initially discussed but Sueter&#x27;s technical advisor favoured a large seaplane for coastal patrol and dockyard defence that would also be capable of bombing the German High Seas Fleet at its base in Kiel. The AD Seaplane Type 1000 prototype had already been commissioned from J. Samuel White &amp; Co. of Cowes.

Handley Page suggested a land-based aircraft of similar size, and a specification drawn up around his suggestions was formally issued on 28 December 1914 for four prototypes. It called for a large biplane powered by two Sunbeam engines, which was required to fit in a hangar and would therefore have folding wings. It was to carry six bombs and have armour to protect crew and engines. The crew of two were to be enclosed in a glazed cockpit and the only defensive armament planned was a rifle for the observer/engineer. The designation O/100 came from Handley Page&#x27;s sequence of using letters for each of their designs, with 100 for the proposed wingspan of the aircraft. The design was approved on 4 February 1915, with Rolls-Royce Eagle engines and on 9 February the contract was amended to include eight additional aircraft.
The O/100 was an unequal-span three-bay biplane, with the overhanging part of the upper wing braced by kingposts, a rectangular section fuselage and a biplane tail with twin balanced rudders, between the horizontal surfaces. Balanced ailerons were fitted to the upper wing only and extended beyond the wing trailing edge and wing tips. The engines drove four-bladed propellers, rotating in opposite directions to cancel the torque, and were enclosed in armoured nacelles mounted between the wings on tubular steel struts. The nacelles had a long tapered fairing to reduce drag. To clear the wing rigging wires when the wings were folded, the rear portions of the fairings were hinged to fold inward. The structure of the fuselage and flying surfaces was primarily spruce, with the spars routed into I-beams to reduce weight.

==Development==
The four prototypes and first production batch of six aircraft were built at Cricklewood, with the first aircraft delivered by road to Hendon on 9 December 1915. The first flight of the prototype, was made at Hendon on 17 December, when a short straight flight was made, the aircraft taking off without trouble at . A second flight was made the following day, when it was found that the aircraft would not fly faster than about . This was blamed on the drag caused by large honeycomb radiators, which were changed to tube radiators mounted on either side of the engine nacelles. A third flight on 31 December revealed a number of control problems, the ailerons and elevators were effective but heavy, partly due to excessive friction in the control circuit and the rudders were seriously overbalanced. After minor modifications, the aircraft was flown to RNAS Eastchurch, where full-speed trials were made. On reaching , the tail unit began to vibrate and twist violently; the pilot immediately landed and an inspection showed severe damage to the rear fuselage structure. Reinforcement failed to cure the problem, meanwhile the enclosed cockpit and most of the armour plating were also removed. The second prototype was completed in April 1916 and had an open cockpit in a longer nose with room for a gunner. To save weight, most of the armour was deleted and was the arrangement for later production of the machine.
After a series of proving flights at Hendon, &quot;1456&quot; was accepted by the RNAS and was flown to Manston for further trials. These revealed that despite a reduced balance area on the elevators, there was still a tail oscillation problem. A lack of directional stability caused by the increased forward side area was partly cured by adding a fixed fin but to find the cause of the tail oscillation, the Admiralty called in Frederick Lanchester from the National Physics Laboratory. Lanchester agreed that simple structural weakness was not the root of the problem and that resonance of the fuselage was the probable cause. Static tests on the third prototype which had a redesigned, stiffer, fuselage structure showed nothing. Lanchester flew as an observer in an amidships crew position on 26 June. The tail oscillations started at and Lanchester observed that the tail twisted by 15° to either side and that there was asymmetrical movement of the right and left halves of the elevators, which were connected by long control cables rather than being rigidly linked. He recommended that they be rigidly linked, that elevator balances be removed and additional bracing added between the lower longerons and the lower tailplane spar, measures which were successful in solving the problem.

The fourth prototype was completed with the same fuselage structure as the second prototype and had provision for armament, with a Scarff ring mounting in the nose, a pair of post mountings in the mid position and a gun mounting in the rear fuselage. This was also the first O/100 to be fitted with Rolls-Royce Eagle engines. After completing acceptance trials, the second and third prototypes were retained at Manston to form a Handley Page training flight. The first prototype was rebuilt to production standard and the fourth prototype tested a new nacelle design, which was un-armoured, had an enlarged fuel tank and a shorter fairing obviating the need for the tail to fold. The new nacelle was used on all aircraft built after the initial batch of twelve. From &quot;1461&quot;, an additional fuel tank was fitted in the fuselage above the bomb floor. A total of 46 O/100s were built before being superseded by the Type O/400.
The most significant difference between the two types was the use of Eagle VIII engines. Unlike the earlier engines, this engine was not built in handed versions, because production of engines of both types for engine type approval had been difficult. Wind tunnel tests at the NPL established that the counter-rotating propellers caused directional instability with the O/100. Only one version was necessary, simplifying production and maintenance and the p-factor was overcome by slightly offsetting the fin. The O/400 had a strengthened fuselage, an increased bomb load, the nacelle tanks were removed and the fuel was carried in two fuselage tanks, supplying a pair of gravity tanks. The new nacelles were smaller and had simplified supporting struts; the reduction of drag improved maximum speed and ceiling. The revised nacelle was tested in &quot;3188&quot;, which in 1917 was flown at Martlesham Heath with a variety of engine installations. An initial order for 100 of the revised design, with Sunbeam Maori or Eagle engines, was placed on 14 August but cancelled shortly afterwards. Twelve sets of Cricklewood-built components were transferred to the Royal Aircraft Factory, where they were assembled into the first production O/400s. More than 400 were supplied before the Armistice at a price of £6,000 each. Another 107 were licence-built in the US by the Standard Aircraft Corporation (out of 1,500 ordered by the air corps). Forty-six out of an order for fifty were built by Clayton &amp; Shuttleworth in Lincoln.

==Operational history==
===Flanders===

The first twenty O/100s deployed to France were received by 7 Squadron and 7A Squadron of the 5th Wing RNAS at Dunkirk in late 1916. At first the O/100s were used for daylight attacks over the North Sea, damaging a German destroyer on 23 April 1917, but the loss of an aircraft to fighter attack two days later resulted in a switch to night operations, usually by single aircraft, against German-occupied Belgian ports, railway targets and airfields. On the night of 16/17 August 14 O/100s dropped of bombs on Torhout railway station. O/100s from Coudekerque carried out anti-U-boat patrols off the mouth of the River Tees in September 1917. Eleven U-boats were sighted and seven attacked with bombs, but none were sunk, although U-boat operations were drastically reduced in the area.

===Dardanelles===
As part of the Dardanelles campaign, an O/100 was flown from England to Mudros on the Greek island of Lemnos in the eastern Mediterranean by Lieutenant Ross Smith. It made night attacks against Ottoman Empire force, and supplied the small number of aircraft supporting the Arab insurgency being directed by T. E. Lawrence.

On the night of 3/4 July 1917, the Handley Page was used for an attack on Galata air base but the engines overheated and the crew turned back, jettisoning some bombs and dropping the others on an army camp near Bulair. On 8/9 July 1917, an attempt to bomb Constantinople had to be abandoned after hours of battling headwinds, instead targets of opportunity were bombed on the way back.

The next night, Constantinople was reached before midnight and they attacked the anchored battlecruiser from with eight bombs, and sank an Ottoman S138-class torpedo boat (Jadhigar-i-Millet). The crew then bombed the SS &quot;General&quot;, thought to be the German HQ, and dropped two bombs on the Ottoman War Office building before returning to Mudros at 

On 6 August the aircraft was used to bomb warehouses and ships in the harbour of Pandera on the south shore of the Marmara, and was then used on anti-submarine patrols until 2 September, when it was sent to bomb Adrianopolis. En route the crew dropped two bombs on a submarine as it dived, before dropping two more on Kuleli Burgas and then the rest on the Adrianopolis railway station buildings. On 30 September, (flown by John Alcock), it raided railway stations near Constantinople and Haidar Pasha but was forced to ditch in the Gulf of Xeros, after an engine failed. The crew floated with the aircraft for two hours and fired Very lights but were not seen by British destroyers. They then swam for an hour to reach the Gallipoli peninsula, where they were captured. Another Handley Page was flown from England to reinforce the Palestine Brigade and served with 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps. In September 1918, the bomber was used to supply Colonel T. E. Lawrence and the Arabs.

===Independent Force===
On the night of 16/17 March 1918, a Handley Page of the Luxeuil Wing bombed a railway junction at Moulins-lès-Metz and in April, individual aircraft bombed a railway junction at Armaville on 5/6 April and a steelworks at Hagendingen and the Chambley airfield on 14/15 April.

The Luxeuil Wing was disbanded in May to equip 10 Squadron RNAS for operations on the Western Front against the German spring offensive. In September 1918, the 41st Wing was formed at Manston with the Handley Pages of &quot;A&quot; Squadron RNAS, for night bombing, and flown to Ochey in October. (&quot;A&quot; Squadron was later 16 Squadron RNAS, then from 1 April 1918, 216 Squadron RAF.) On 9 August, 97 Squadron arrived in France and ten days later, 215 Squadron was transferred, then on 31 August 115 Squadron arrived and 100 Squadron was re-equipped with Handley Pages by September. Operations began with 97 Squadron on 19 August and 215 Squadron three nights later. Cologne railway station was bombed by two 216 Squadron aircraft on 21/22 August and six attacks were made on the German chemical industry, the raid on 25 August by two 215 Squadron aircraft on the works at Mannheim being particularly accurate. Five aircraft of 216 Squadron attacked on 2/3 September, one bomb causing M400,000 worth of damage and the first attack by 115 Squadron was made on 16/17 September, when seven Handley Pages were lost, variously to engine-trouble or anti-aircraft fire.
The improved O/400 began entering service in April 1918, gradually allowing the re-equipment of more squadrons. The O/400s could carry the new bombs, which were aimed with the Drift Sight Mk 1A bombsight. Each raid was conducted by up to forty O/400s. On the night of 21/22 October, four Handley Pages attacked Kaiserslautern with heavy bombs and four dropped incendiaries. Three heavy bombers and two incendiary bombers caused M500,000 of damage and Kaiserslautern was bombed again on 23/24 October, along with Koblenz, Mannheim and Wiesbaden. The bombers were again diverted to army support during the month, and on the night of 9/10 October, 97, 215 and 216 Squadrons bombed Metz, one bomb hitting a powder store and rocked the town, the damage being estimated by the Germans at M1,000,000. Operations were reduced during the last days of the war by weather but several aerodromes were attacked, particularly that at Morhange.

== Post-1918 history ==


After the war, O/400s remained in squadron service until replaced by the Vickers Vimy toward the end of 1919. War-surplus aircraft were converted for civilian use in the UK and nine were used by Handley Page Transport. Eight O/400s were fitted to carry passengers and operated by 86 (Communication) Wing from Hendon, to provide transport between London and Paris for the officials negotiating the Treaty of Versailles. Two were fitted as VIP transports and finished in silver dope, named &quot;Great Britain&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; and the others, seating eight, retained their dark green finish. The first ever in-flight movie, 1925&#x27;s silent &quot;The Lost World&quot;, was shown on a Type O, on the London to Paris flight by Imperial Airways in April 1925.

Six aircraft were sold to the Republic of China as O/7 transports, and following delivery to China were re-assembled at Nanyuan, near Beijing. The aircraft flew their first airmail and passengers between Beijing and Tientsin on 7 May 1920. Civil war disrupted these services and they were taken over by various warlords.

== Variants ==

Before 1924, Handley Page used an alphabetical system for aircraft designations and the Type O followed the Type M and Type N. Type Os are frequently misnamed with the numeral &quot;0&quot; instead of the letter &quot;O&quot;. The company designations &quot;H.P.11&quot; and &quot;H.P.12&quot; were applied retrospectively after HP switched to type numbers in 1924.

===Captured aircraft===
An early O/100, which had flown from Manston Airfield, developed engine trouble and landed behind German lines on 1 January 1917. The five crew members became prisoners of war and the aircraft was flown in German markings until it was wrecked.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 19 August 1918, RAF Type O/400 &quot;D4593&quot; crashed at Maxstoke during a test flight from Castle Bromwich Aerodrome, killing all seven on board. Fabric from a wing tore off, causing a loss of control.
* On 17 May 1919, a Type O/400 carrying T. E. Lawrence (&#x27;Lawrence of Arabia&#x27;) to Egypt crashed at Roma-Centocelle airport. Pilot and co-pilot were killed while Lawrence survived the incident with a broken shoulder blade and two broken ribs. 
* On 14 December 1920, a Handley Page Transport O/400 (G-EAMA), operating from the company airfield at Cricklewood, crashed on take-off when it hit a tree at Golders Green, killing the two crew and two of the six passengers.
* On 31 March 1922, all 14 persons aboard a Type O/7 operated by Beijing-Han Airlines were killed when the plane struck the tops of trees while making its approach to Nanyuan Airport in Peiping.

==Surviving aircraft==
No complete example of any Type O aircraft remains. The Royal Air Force Museum Cosford has several relics, including pieces of fabric from an O/100 and various small O/400 components and five O/400 wing sections which had been used as part of a shed roof in Flintshire until their recovery in late 2013.
While there are no extant airframes, a detailed cockpit reproduction can be found at Stow Maries Great War Aerodrome, near Maldon in Essex.

<text>USS &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; (ex-&quot;St. Andrews Bay&quot;) was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

She was launched on 20 July 1944 by the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. She was sponsored by Mrs. Edwin D. McMorries, wife of Captain Edwin D. McMorries, Surgeon at the Naval Hospital at Puget Sound Naval Yard, and commissioned on 5 February 1945.

She was reclassified as AGMR-1 on 1 June 1963, renamed Annapolis on 22 June 1963 and finally recommissioned on 7 March 1964.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
===Construction and World War II===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was originally laid down under the name &quot;St. Andrews Bay&quot; at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, on 29 November 1943. During construction, she was renamed &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; after the Gilbert Islands campaign, which culminated in the bloody Battle of Tarawa the same month that work began on the ship. The ship was launched on 20 July 1944 and was commissioned on 5 February 1945. Final fitting out work was then completed, and on 20 February, she got underway for San Diego, California. While en route, a Navy blimp spotted a stray naval mine and requested that &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; destroy it with her anti-aircraft guns; her inexperienced gunners expended nearly 850 rounds in total from her 20- and 40 mm guns before they destroyed the mine.

The ship then stopped in Alameda, California, to refuel before arriving in San Diego. There, she loaded ammunition and took on her complement of aviators from Marine Air Group 2, which comprised the fighter squadron VMF-512 and the torpedo squadron VMB-143. The former consisted of eighteen Vought F4U Corsairs and two Grumman F6F Hellcats, and the latter was equipped with twelve Grumman TBM Avengers. On 12 April, &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; left San Diego, bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for a week of combat training exercises. On 2 May, she left Hawaii for the western Pacific, where she joined the main American fleet waging the war against Japanese forces. She arrived in Ulithi in the Caroline Islands on 14 May; her escorting destroyers—, , and —repeatedly reported what proved to be likely false submarine contacts on the voyage. 

====Battle of Okinawa====

On 17 May, the ship sortied for the Ryukyu Islands to join the fleet, then in the midst of the Battle of Okinawa. She arrived there and joined Task Unit 52.1.1. on 21 May. &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; spent the following three days contributing her fighters to the combat air patrol, while her TBMs were employed on anti-submarine patrols. As the pilots got acclimated to combat missions, they began to be used to escort aerial attacks and performing strikes on Japanese positions on the island. Over the course of the rest of the month, her aircraft attacked numerous defensive positions, particularly around Shuri Castle in southern Okinawa, as the marines fought their way across the island. One of her aircraft shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-46 reconnaissance aircraft, which proved to be the only aerial victory any of the ship&#x27;s pilots claimed during the war. During these operations, she lost only a single Corsair, which crashed after the pilot turned too low to the water.

On 1 June, &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; was transferred to Task Unit 32.1.3, and she spent the next two weeks carrying out repeated, heavy strikes on the nearby Sakishima Islands—particularly Ishigaki Island, Irabu Island, and Miyako-jima—in an attempt to neutralize airfields there to prevent the Japanese from intervening in the fighting on Okinawa. In addition, the aviators attacked other critical infrastructure, such as radio and radar stations, harbor facilities, barracks, and villages. During these raids, two aircraft were shot down and a further two were badly damaged and forced to ditch at sea near &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot;. In total, five men were killed in the attacks.

====Later operations====
On 16 June, &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; left the Okinawa area, bound for San Pedro Bay in the Philippines for a period of rest and replenishment. Over the course of the following five days, the ship&#x27;s crew loaded fuel, munitions for her aircraft, other ammunition, and other supplies. They also made repairs to the ship&#x27;s machinery, necessitated by heavy use in the fighting off Okinawa over the past month. On 26 June, she sortied in company with the escort carriers and to raid Japanese positions in the occupied Dutch East Indies. Their attacks began on 30 June, and were coordinated to support the impending Australian invasion at Balikpapan. By 4 July, the Australians had secured the area, but in the course of the fighting, one of &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot;″ Hellcats was shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire. The carriers then left for the Philippines, arriving back in San Pedro Bay on 6 July.

&quot;Gilbert Island&quot; remained in San Pedro Bay for almost the rest of the month to rest her crew. On 29 July, she got underway again to return to operations with the main fleet, which had shifted from Okinawa to the Japan campaign. &quot;Gilbert Island&quot; was assigned to cover the fleet&#x27;s logistics train that kept the rest of Third Fleet in operations off the coast of Japan. From 10 to 12 August, she and several other vessels had to withdraw temporarily to avoid a typhoon that was passing through the area. On 15 August, she joined Task Group 30.8, and that morning Japan announced it would surrender, ending the fighting. The ship was detached from TG 30.8 on 2 September, the day Japan formally surrendered, and &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; thereafter returned to Okinawa. She stayed there for about six weeks before departing for Formosa, where she covered elements of the Chinese Nationalist Army&#x27;s 70th Army as they landed on the island at Keelung to retake control from the defeated Japanese. &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; then sailed for Saipan in the Mariana Islands to embark passengers returning to the United States, before continuing on to Pearl Harbor and ultimately San Diego, arriving there on 4 December. In the course of her career during World War II, the ship received three battle stars.

===Atlantic Fleet operations===
On 21 January 1946, &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; departed San Diego, having been ordered to move to the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived in her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 February. She was decommissioned there on 21 May and allocated to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. In November 1949, she was towed to the Inactive Ship Facility in Philadelphia. The ship remained out of service until the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 drastically increased the Navy&#x27;s need for warships. &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; was recommissioned on 7 September 1951, and moved to the Boston Naval Shipyard in November for an overhaul to prepare her for active service. On 1 August 1952, she was finally ready to join the Atlantic Fleet. Her first mission began eight days later, when she departed to ferry a group of jet aircraft to Yokohama, Japan; she arrived there on 18 September. She arrived in Quonset Point, Rhode Island, on 22 October; this was now her new home port.

On 5 January 1953, the ship sailed for a training cruise to the West Indies; she patrolled off the East Coast of the United States for much of the rest of the year. Late in 1953, she cruised in Canadian waters and visited Halifax, after which she returned to Boston for an overhaul. On 5 January 1954, she departed for a cruise across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean Sea that lasted for two months. She arrived back in Quonset Point on 12 March, where she embarked on training exercises for reserve crews. On 9 June, she conducted the first experimental tests of operating jet aircraft, though these consisted of brief touch-and-go landings. 

On 25 June, she sailed from Rhode Island, bound for Boston, where she was decommissioned again on 11 January 1955 and returned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. On 7 May 1959, she was reclassified as an aircraft ferry with the hull number AKV-39. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 June 1961, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register.

===As &quot;Annapolis&quot;===
In November 1961, &quot;Gilbert Islands&quot; was instated to the Naval Vessel Register, but she remained out of service. On 1 June 1963, she was reclassified as a communications relay ship with the hull number AGMR-1. She was renamed &quot;Annapolis&quot; on 22 June and was recommissioned on 7 March 1964. The purpose of the ship was to serve as a mobile command and control station to coordinate with ground forces in regions where the Navy had no existing communications infrastructure. She was extensively reconstructed for this purpose, receiving thirty radio transmitters, five antenna towers, and teletype equipment. One of the main benefits &quot;Annapolis&quot; provided was significantly greater capacity to route radio frequencies during crises, since the volume of radio traffic frequently overwhelmed the radio frequencies that were available on normal ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore equipment. The ship underwent acceptance trials in 1964 that included trial of her new systems during Operation Steel Pike, which saw a combined Spanish and American fleet of some eighty ships operate in joint training maneuvers. She was pronounced ready for active service with the Atlantic Fleet on 16 December 1964.

&quot;Annapolis&quot; spent the first half of 1965 participating in routine training operations on the East Coast, operating out of Norfolk. On 28 June, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet, based in Long Beach, California. By September, she was ready to deploy to Southeast Asia as part of Seventh Fleet to support the forces then fighting the Vietnam War. In addition to communications support, the ship also assisted with cryptographic work. The ship was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her service during the period from 9 January 1967 to 29 January 1968. She remained on station in the region for four years, during which time she made periodic visits to Hong Kong, Formosa, and the Philippines to provide periods of rest for her crew. She also underwent overhauls at Yokosuka. On 9 April 1969, she left East Asia to return to the United States. During her four years supporting forces in the Vietnam War, she was awarded eight battle stars.

Rather than cross the Pacific, &quot;Annapolis&quot; sailed west, passing through the Indian Ocean an stopping in Mauritius and Portuguese Angola in early May. She rounded the Cape of Good Hope and stopped in Dakar, Senegal, before crossing the equator on 19 May. She continued north to Lisbon, Portugal, and Rota, Spain, and then entered the Mediterranean to operate with Sixth Fleet for two months. She finally departed for the United States on 29 August, stopping first at Norfolk and then arriving in Philadelphia on 1 October. The ship was decommissioned there on 20 December and returned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register a second time, on 15 October 1972, but lingered on until 19 December 1979, when she was sold to the Union Minerals &amp; Alloys Corp. to be broken up.

<text>USS &quot;Kula Gulf was a of the [[United States Navy]]. She was originally named Vermillion Bay&quot;, but was renamed during construction. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Kula Gulf&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
===World War II===

The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. Originally named &quot;Vermillion Bay&quot;, the ship assigned hull number CVE-108 was renamed &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; after the Battle of Kula Gulf on 6 November 1943, before work at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards began. Her keel was laid down on 16 December, and she was launched on 15 August 1944. She was then moved to Portland, Oregon, where she was completed by the Williamette Iron &amp; Steel Corporation. The ship was commissioned on 12 May 1945. She then went on a shakedown cruise and completed training exercises, including for night carrier operations, off the West Coast of the United States. She finally got underway to join the American fleet fighting in the western Pacific on 5 August.

&quot;Kula Gulf&quot; passed through Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and the Marshall Islands before arriving in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines on 14 September, nearly two weeks after Japan surrendered, formally ending World War II. The ship spent the next two months patrolling in the East China Sea, based in Okinawa. She also transported planes between Saipan and Guam in the Mariana Islands during this period. She thereafter joined Operation Magic Carpet, the effort to repatriate American service members after the war. She embarked some 600 men at Guam and left on 17 November, bound for San Francisco. She arrived there on 4 December and disembarked her passengers. She made a second cruise to East Asia on 10 December, arriving in China on 10 January 1946; she picked up some 1,520 men at Tientsin and Qingdao and brought them back to San Diego, California, arriving on 26 January.

===Atlantic Fleet operations===
On 26 February, &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; left San Francisco with orders to move to the East Coast of the United States. She transited the Panama Canal and sailed to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 16 March. There, she was decommissioned on 3 July and assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained out of service for the next four five years. She was recommissioned on 15 February 1951 to serve as a training ship, as the outbreak of the Korean War had drastically increased the need for trained pilots. She conducted a shakedown cruise south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before sailing from Norfolk on 6 August with a load of aircraft to be transferred to Casablanca in French Morocco. She arrived back in Norfolk on 1 September, and she thereafter began her role as a training carrier. She served in this capacity for the following fifteen months, training pilots for fighters, anti-submarine patrol aircraft, and helicopters.

&quot;Kula Gulf&quot; took part in Marine Corps helicopter training exercises held at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico in May 1952. In October, she served as part of the anti-submarine screen for a group of troop ships sailing to Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada. After returning to the United States, she underwent a modernization that began in January 1953 and lasted until July. She thereafter returned to anti-submarine training exercises off the East Coast of the United States and in the Caribbean Sea. These maneuvers continued for the following two years, during which time &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; helped to develop anti-submarine tactics to counter the threat of Soviet submarines. She also participated in training exercises used to test helicopter assault tactics being developed by the Marine Corps. She took part in a major exercise to test the so-called &quot;vertical assault&quot; doctrine at Vieques Island that lasted from February to April 1955. The doctrine envisioned using escort carriers to launch helicopters carrying marines and heavy equipment to seize strategic crossroads inland from the invasion beach, while traditional amphibious forces went ashore.

On 26 April, &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; arrived back in Norfolk. She sailed north to the Boston Naval Shipyard on 13 May, and then moved to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a pre-inactivation overhaul on 19 August. She was decommissioned on 15 December at Philadelphia, and returned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. While out of service, she was reclassified with the hull number AKV-8 on 7 May 1959.

===Vietnam War===
In the early 1960s, the United States began to be increasingly involved in South Vietnam, providing military assistance to defend it against attacks by communist North Vietnam as part of the US&#x27;s broader policy of containment. Due to the increased logistical demands on the US Navy, &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service on 30 June 1965 to be used as an aircraft transport. She assisted in the transport of the 1st Cavalry Division and its helicopters shortly thereafter, departing from the East Coast and taking them to South Vietnam. She thereafter transitioned to the West Coast of the United States, continuing to ferry men and equipment between the US and South Vietnam. She served in that role through 1969, and was eventually struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1970. &quot;Kula Gulf&quot; was broken up the following year.

<text>USS &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; (ex-&quot;Winjah Bay&quot;) was a built by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation for the United States Navy during World War II. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Salerno Bay&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==

===World War II===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship, originally named &quot;Winjah Bay&quot;, was built at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. She was laid down on 7 February 1944, and during construction, she was renamed &quot;Salerno Bay&quot;, after the invasion of Salerno in Sicily the previous year. &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; was launched on 26 September and three days later, was moved to the Commercial Iron Works of Portland, Oregon, to complete fitting out. The ship was commissioned into active service on 19 May 1945. Toward the end of June, &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; embarked Marine Carrier Group 5, which consisted of fighter squadron VMF-514 and torpedo bomber squadron VTMB-144. She then cruised off southern California for training exercises before deploying to combat theaters in the western Pacific.

On 17 August, two days after Japan announced it would surrender, &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; left California. Since the war was now over, she embarked the composite squadron VC-68 to transport it overseas. She stopped in Hawaii on the way, where she conducted training exercises for her marine aviators. She eventually arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 21 September, and later moved to Hagushi. In early October, an approaching typhoon forced her to go to sea to avoid bring driven ashore by the strong winds. She arrived back in Hagushi on 12 October, but departed two days later as part of the fleet covering the Chinese Nationalist force that moved to Formosa to take control of the island from the defeated Japanese. &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; then departed the western Pacific, bound for Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where she stayed for three weeks. She then moved to nearby Guam and embarked American service members to take them back to the United States. She sailed back to San Diego, by way of Pearl Harbor, arriving in early December.

===Atlantic Fleet service===
In mid-December, &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet; she departed for the East Coast of the United States soon thereafter, passed through the Panama Canal, and arrived in her new home port at Norfolk, Virginia, on 23 December. In her new assignment, she was tasked with training new carrier pilots and qualifying them for carrier operations. She spent 1946 and into 1947 cruising off the East Coast, as far south as the Caribbean Sea, performing her training duties. In early 1947, the Navy ordered &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; to be laid up in reserve; in June, she moved from Norfolk to Boston, where the work to preserve the ship for a lengthy period out of service was done. She was decommissioned on 4 October and allocated to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 20 June 1951, when she was recommissioned.

After returning to active service, she conducted a shakedown cruise before joining Carrier Division 18 in October. She participated in training exercises with the rest of the division off the Virginia Capes and the Caribbean in November and December. She returned to Norfolk on 18 December for three weeks, before getting underway again on 7 January 1952 for another training period in the Caribbean. In early February, she returned to Norfolk, but her stay there was brief. By March, she had returned to the Caribbean and was patrolling off Puerto Rico. Another training period off the Virginia Capes followed from April to July. &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; departed the East Coast on 26 August for a voyage to Europe. She joined the ships of Task Force 173 on the way, and the squadron took part in joint training maneuvers off Norway with other vessels from NATO fleets in September. &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; sailed south to Gibraltar in early October and then cruised in the Mediterranean Sea with the Sixth Fleet for the next month. In late November, she passed back through the Strait of Gibraltar, arriving back in Norfolk on 7 December. She then resumed her normal routine of training exercises off the East Coast and in the Caribbean, which lasted into 1953.

In early 1953, the Navy decided to return &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; to the reserve fleet. She returned to Boston on 8 June to be prepared for inactivation. She was decommissioned there again on 16 February 1954. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. In 1959, she was reclassified with the hull number AKV-10, but she remained out of service. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1961 and sold to the ship breaking firm Revalorizacion de Materiales, S.A., and handed over to be scrapped on 14 December. &quot;Salerno Bay&quot; was broken up the following year in Bilbao, Spain.

<text>Mister Mxyzptlk ( or ), sometimes called Mxy, is a character who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. He is usually presented as a trickster in the classical mythological sense. Mxyzptlk possesses reality-warping powers with which he enjoys tormenting Superman or making life difficult. His portrayal has varied, with him being an outright supervillain in some media, and an antihero in others.

Mr. Mxyzptlk was created to appear in &quot;Superman&quot; #30 (September / October 1944), in the story &quot;The Mysterious Mr. Mxyztplk&quot; (the original spelling), by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Ira Yarborough. Due to publishing lag time, the character saw print first in the &quot;Superman&quot; daily comic strip by writer Whitney Ellsworth and artist Wayne Boring.

In most of Mxyzptlk&#x27;s appearances in DC Comics, he can be stopped only by tricking him into saying or spelling his own name backwards, which will return him to his home in the fifth dimension and keep him there for a minimum of 90 days. This limitation of the character was modified in the 1986 &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; reboot, upon which Mxyzptlk changes his condition to leave to a new requirement each story, such as having Superman succeed in getting him to paint his own face blue.

Mxyzptlk has appeared in various television adaptations of Superman. He first appeared in the 1966 animated series &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, voiced by Gilbert Mack, and later appeared in Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;Super Friends&quot; franchise, voiced by Frank Welker, the 1988-1992 television series &quot;Superboy&quot;, portrayed by Michael J. Pollard, and the 1993 television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot;, portrayed by Howie Mandel. He also appeared in the 2001 television series &quot;Smallville&quot; played by Trent Ford, and in the Arrowverse television series &quot;Supergirl&quot; played by Peter Gadiot in the second season, and by Thomas Lennon in the fifth and sixth seasons, while Gilbert Gottfried prominently voiced the character in several voice-acting-related projects until his death.

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden Age===

Mister Mxyztplk (the original spelling) was introduced in the Golden Age as an imp from the &quot;fifth dimension&quot;. Not being bound by physical laws, he can do things that seem to be magical. In his first appearance, Mxyztplk wreaks havoc across Metropolis by using his powers to pull all manner of pranks, first pretending he got hit by a truck and killed, then increasing his weight when the ambulance gets there and waking up to shock them. What is more, he destroys Superman&#x27;s worldview of himself. Mxyztplk jumps out a window, fooling Superman into thinking he is committing suicide. When he appears unharmed, an astonished Superman exclaims, &quot;I-I thought I was the only man who could fly!!&quot; He gives the Mayor the voice of a donkey, and then blows papers over the town. Mxyztplk soon tells Superman that he is a jester in his home dimension, explaining why he uses his powers to play practical jokes, but one day he finds a book that tells him of this world.

Originally, Mxyztplk has designs on conquering the planet for himself but soon settles for tormenting Superman whenever he gets the opportunity. His only weaknesses are that he cannot stand being ridiculed and if he says or spells his name backward, he is involuntarily sent back to his home dimension for a minimum of 90 days. He first gets fooled when Superman asks what the word is and the imp says he can&#x27;t believe Superman would have thought him stupid enough to say &quot;Klptzyxm&quot;--before realizing what he has just said and being transported home. Mxyztplk often looks for ways to counter the latter weakness, but he always proves gullible enough for Superman to trick him time and time again. In the Golden Age, saying &quot;Klptzyxm&quot; will not only send Mxyztplk back to the fifth dimension but also anyone else who said it. To return to his/her home dimension, one has to say one&#x27;s own name backward.

===Silver Age===

Mxyztplk originally appeared as a small bald man in a purple suit, green bow tie, and purple derby hat. This was changed to a futuristic looking orange outfit with purple trim and white hair on the sides of his head in the mid-1950s, although the bowler hat remains adapted to the new color scheme. In &quot;Superman&quot; #131 (1959), the spelling of Mxyztplk&#x27;s name changed (by some accounts through a mistake) to &quot;Mxyzptlk&quot;.

It was explained in the Silver Age &quot;Superman&quot; comics that Mister Mxyzptlk could affect Superman because Superman is susceptible to magic, which was established as a major weakness for the superhero.

When a Mxyzptlk jaunt causes a special appearance by Superman to be cancelled and children, who had done nothing to Mxyzptlk, to be disappointed, Superman himself decides to turn the tables and visit the fifth dimension, making trouble for the imp, who is running for mayor. For example, when Mxyzptlk furnishes a huge supply of food for prospective voters, he says, &quot;Eat up, folks, the food&#x27;s on me!&quot; Superman uses super-breath to blow the food all over the imp and then chortles to the voters, &quot;Like he said, folks – the food is on him!&quot; The imp tries to get the Man of Steel to say &quot;Namrepus&quot; (&quot;Superman&quot; backwards) repeatedly, but when he finally succeeds, it does not work and Superman remains in the fifth dimension. Mxyzptlk ultimately loses the election, and, his mission accomplished, Superman returns to Earth by whispering &quot;Le-Lak&quot; (his Kryptonian birth name Kal-El backwards).

===Multiverse===
After the establishment of DC Comics&#x27; Multiverse in the 1960s, it was later explained that the purple-suited Mxyztplk lives in the fifth dimension connected to Earth-Two, and the orange-costumed Mxyzptlk in the fifth dimension connected to Earth-One. The Earth-One version is also retconned into Superboy stories as the young red-haired Master Mxyzptlk, who bedevils Superboy during his youth in Smallville. He even appears as a deus ex machina to stop the Kryptonite Kid, who was killing a helpless Superboy, so that he could continue to bedevil Superboy and, later, Superman.

A 30th-century descendant of Mxyzptlk appeared in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #310 (July 1963) with similar abilities. Much crueler than his ancestor, this version kills most of the Legion of Super-Heroes until Superboy tricks him into falling victim to the same &quot;Kltpzyxm&quot; weakness, reversing the effects of his magic. However, in another story from &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #355 (April 1967) featuring the 30th-century Adult Legion, the brother of the cruel Mxyzptlk teams up with a descendant of Lex Luthor to save the Legionnaires from the Legion of Super-Villains and join the Legion themselves.

===&quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;===
Alan Moore offered a radically different interpretation of the character in the 1986 two-issue story &quot;&quot;, a possible end of the adventures of the Earth-One Superman. Mister Mxyzptlk (appearing in darker colors and looking more sinister than in the past) explains that the problem with immortality is finding ways to spend the time. He spent his first 2,000 years without moving or breathing, the next 2,000 years doing only good deeds, and the following 2,000 years being the mischievous character that he is normally portrayed as. He has now decided to try being evil, and is responsible for all of the nightmarish events in the story (also musing that after 2,000 years of evil, he may spend the next 2,000 years feeling guilty). Before attacking Superman, he reveals his true form, which is described by Lois Lane as having &quot;height, width, depth, and a couple of other things&quot;. He is killed when Superman sends him to the Phantom Zone at the same time that Mister Mxyzptlk begins an escape to the fifth dimension by saying his name backwards voluntarily, tearing him in two. Despite having recognized that his foe was too dangerous to be stopped any other way, remorse over the killing prompts Superman to drain himself of his powers using gold kryptonite.

Another final appearance of Mister Mxyzptlk was in the final issue of &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;, which shows Jor-El&#x27;s discovery of the Phantom Zone. By the end of the story, the Phantom Zone, the fifth dimension and Bizarro World are all destroyed, and Mister Mxyzptlk, infilled by power endowed by a hideously disfigured wizard who was a denizen in the Phantom Zone, is transformed into an entity not even remotely human. He then throws the dead Argo City into Metropolis, littering it with kryptonite and dead Kryptonians, and announces to an exasperated and horrified Superman that this was his last jest, that he will never be able to top it, and so says farewell to Superman.

===Modern Age===
Mxyzptlk made it through the Crisis on Infinite Earths relatively unchanged, although the unpleasant nature of his pranks and the psychological effects they have on others is played up more, such as when he animated the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building heedless of the occupants inside who were being violently thrown around with its movements. He also began smoking cigars, symbolic of his newer, more antagonistic nature. His first appearance in this new continuity saw him initially adopting the guise of &quot;Ben deRoy&quot;, a reality-warping mystery man resembling the Beyonder (the former name is an anagram of the latter), who was threatening the Marvel Universe around the same time. He resumed his more familiar appearance when he was confronted by Superman.

In his first Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; story, Mxyzptlk played the &quot;Name Game&quot; with Superman, with saying or writing his name backwards sending him home. However, in his next appearance, this has no effect; the &quot;condition&quot; that would send him back to the fifth dimension would be anything he stated it to be for the occasion, and the act itself would not banish him, but instead be Mxyzptlk abiding by his own terms. After his first encounter with Lex Luthor taught him how to lie, Mxyzptlk began rigging his contests with false or misleading aspects to make his challenges greater. Ultimately, the stories reverted to Mxyzptlk having to say his name backwards to get him to leave.

One of Mxyzptlk&#x27;s most prominent storylines in the new continuity was the &quot;Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite&quot; storyline, when he provided Lex Luthor with a sample of red kryptonite that took away Superman&#x27;s powers so long as Luthor never revealed to Superman that Mxyzptlk was involved. Despite Superman&#x27;s lack of powers, he still risked his life to battle Mammoth and the mad scientist Thaddeus Killgrave. Eventually, the spell was lifted when Luthor told &quot;Clark Kent&quot; where the red kryptonite had come from, believing that he would not be breaking Mxyzptlk&#x27;s rule about not letting Superman know the truth if he told Kent and Kent told Superman (in a one-page aside in this story, Mister Mxyzptlk is implied to also be the Impossible Man, spending his off-time badgering the Fantastic Four of the Marvel Universe).

Many of Mxyzptlk&#x27;s later stories have a postmodern feel to them, similar to Ambush Bug, as he comments on editorial decisions, clichés of the genre, etc. This was most obvious in &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel&quot; #75, a pastiche of Superman&#x27;s death in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #75, where Mxyzptlk creates a duplicate of Doomsday. The confrontation culminates with Mxyzptlk meeting the Supreme Being, who turns out to be Mike Carlin, the then-editor of the Superman titles, who promptly brings him back to life. Although Mxyzptlk does not appear in Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;JLA&quot;, Morrison took advantage of certain similarities to tie Johnny Thunder&#x27;s Thunderbolt and Aquaman&#x27;s nemesis Qwsp to the fifth dimension, implying the dimension may be the origin for legends of djinn. This story also saw the first Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance of Mxyzptlk&#x27;s Earth-One girlfriend, Ms. Gsptlsnz (described as his &quot;quinto-partner&quot;; pronounced Giz-pit-lez-nez or &quot;Gizbie&quot; for short).

In 2001, DC published &quot;Bizarro Comics&quot; in which Mister Mxyzptlk fought an all-powerful entity named A who is conquering and wrecking dimensional worlds—including the 5th dimension—by use of toys and games. Mxyzptlk retains the services of a version of Bizarro who calls him Greg, and pads the story out by writing and drawing 27 off-beat stories using the DC superheroes, taking 160 pages. Bizarro is in two of them. Also of note is the depiction of Bahdnesian thunderbolts and Zook&#x27;s species as native to the fifth dimension.

In &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, the modern Mxyzptlk claims to have always felt the need for a &quot;public&quot; in the third dimension and that Superman was not his first victim.

===Secret origin===
In &quot;Young Justice&quot; #3, Peter David showed Mxyzptlk&#x27;s origins as a serious-minded researcher, who travels through time, summoned by computer-based occultists. He takes the opportunity to conduct some scholarly studies. He chooses to examine a Halloween party in Happy Harbor, focusing on the results of aging a portion of the teens and causing some of the others to frantically dance out of control. What Mxyzptlk does not know was that Robin, Superboy, and Impulse were hired by the town&#x27;s adults to chaperone the party. When the boys confront Mxyzptlk, they realize that this was not the same Mxyzptlk whom Superman had regularly faced; indeed, he appears to not have even assumed the name &quot;Mxyzptlk&quot; at this point, regarding it as sounding like something somebody randomly typed (which is, indeed, how the character chose his name in his first Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance). Upon discovering the chaotic future that awaits him, Mxyzptlk declares that he would dedicate his life to learning and knowledge. However, those words led to a shift in time, creating an apocalyptic world everywhere but outside the building where the Halloween party is being held. This is because Mxyzptlk was not left to annoy Superman. To avoid this, Robin, Superboy, and Impulse realize that they need to instill Mxyzptlk with his trademark wacky sense of humor.

A &quot;Three Stooges&quot; film is uncovered and watched via an old projector. Mxyzptlk is entertained by the comedy in the film, and tries out a Stooge-style poke in the eye on the projectionist Mick Gurk (an homage to the name &quot;McGurk&quot;, the name used by Mxyztplk for a statue he animated in his first appearance), finding the slapstick humor to his liking. He promises that, when it is time, he will hassle Superman as he is supposed to, in honor of Superboy, Impulse, Robin, and even Mick Gurk.

Time is restored to as how it should be...mostly. Outside the civic center is an unexpected Mxyzptlk theme park, the only change to the world.

However, it appears that Mxyzptlk has forgotten this incident as the years have passed. When confronted by Superboy later on, the imp declares that he had no knowledge of his adventure with Young Justice. Whether or not this is true, or Mxyzptlk was merely playing a trick on the Boy of Steel, is never revealed.

===Improper use of power===
In &quot;Emperor Joker&quot;, a multi-issue story throughout the &quot;Superman&quot; titles, Mxyzptlk has his powers temporarily stolen by the Joker, who then remakes the Earth in his own image, due to tricking Mxyzptlk into giving him 99.99% of his power, when Mxyzptlk only intended to give Joker 1% of his power. The imp is unable to remember what to do to break the chain of events that daily culminates with Superman being dragged back to Arkham Asylum by Bizarro. Fortunately, Mxyzptlk is able to reveal the truth to Superman, who manages to find the power to break the cycle and defeat the Joker. As the Joker prepares to end existence, Superman realizes that, for all his power, the Joker still cannot erase Batman (as the Joker defines his very existence by fighting Batman, erasing him would also mean erasing himself), allowing Superman to shatter the Joker&#x27;s control of reality. However, Mxyzptlk saves some of the Joker&#x27;s creations and transfers them into the &#x27;real&#x27; world, including Scorch, Gorgeous Gilly, the new Bizarro and &quot;Ignition&quot;, a black-armored villain who first appeared in the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; story, but was created by someone else (exactly who has never been revealed).

It has also been implied that Mxyzptlk sees himself as serving an important purpose, in teaching Superman not to take everything &quot;too&quot; seriously.

In &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot; #617 (2003), Mxyzptlk is reinvented as fraternal twins with an intense hatred for Superman. Amongst other things, they claim responsibility for the creation of the present-day Persuader. A year later, in &quot;Superman Secret Files and Origins 2004&quot; (2004), he returns to his usual self, following a fellow imp in the fifth dimension combining the twins with the classic Mxyzptlk, resulting in his normal form and personality.

Mxyzptlk formed a significant part of Greg Rucka&#x27;s &quot;Ruin&quot; storyline in &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. His appearance here is similar to his Golden Age look, with the addition of a single lock of hair, resembling Superman&#x27;s S-shaped forelock. This version of Mxyzptlk is less abrasive than he had been previously, and is portrayed as basically on Superman&#x27;s side. The metafictional aspects of the character were also played up, as he visits the DC Comics offices in the real world, presented as fumetti.

At the same time, Mxyzptlk appeared in &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #23, trying to prepare Batman and Superman for the upcoming &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;. The incident features alternate universe versions of Superman, Batman, and Deathstroke the Terminator and implies much chaos that was not shown, such as the planet Mogo visiting Earth to reclaim an old land mass. At the end of this storyline, Mxyzptlk indicates he has erased the knowledge of Superman&#x27;s identity from Lex Luthor&#x27;s mind.
After the fallout of the events of &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; (and, while not mentioned, the corruption of the fifth dimension as seen in &quot;JSA&quot;), the removal of magic from the Earth leaves Mxyzptlk nearly powerless, wandering the streets of Metropolis and unable to remember how to pronounce the inverse of his name to return him home. Superman attempts to help him, but the two are attacked by the villain Ruin. Ruin attempts to assassinate Superman with kryptonite-based weaponry, but Mxyzptlk pushes Superman out of the way, taking a kryptonite spear to the heart and vanishing. Right before he vanishes, he seems to whisper &#x27;kltpzyxm&#x27;.

===&quot;One Year Later&quot;===
&quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; #10 states that Mister Mxyzptlk was last seen 190 days ago and that his name is pronounced &quot;Mix-Yez-Pittle-Ick&quot; (as it was in the 1960s &quot;Superman&quot; CBS-TV cartoon show, mentioned previously).

===Countdown===
Mister Mxyzptlk makes a one-page appearance in &quot;Countdown&quot; #31. On a walk in the fifth dimension with Gsptlsnz and his goldfish Superman, he is grabbed by someone or something unknown, who then disappears with Mxy. It is later revealed in &quot;Countdown&quot; #23, Mxyzptlk was abducted by Superboy-Prime and imprisoned in the Source Wall. Prime has been apparently torturing the imp into helping him bring back his &quot;perfect Earth&quot;, i.e. Earth Prime. Mxyzptlk mentions that he has been coming to Earth for centuries, and has been referred to by many names (Loki, Coyote, and Anansi). He is later sent back to his home by Annataz Arataz, the Earth-3 counterpart of Zatanna, whom Prime had also captured. Arriving in the fifth dimension, he proclaims to Gsptlsnz that he has escaped an encounter with &quot;the Beast&quot; (implying that the fifth dimension is aware of Superboy-Prime, who is referred to as a being of pure evil). Knowing that Superboy-Prime will kill every living soul in the fifth dimension to get revenge on him, Mxyzptlk proclaims that their dimension must be sealed off from outsiders and that he can never return to Earth.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Mxyzptlk&#x27;s history is revealed as a traveling wizard in the fifth dimension who entertained the King-Thing Brpxz of Zrfff. He did so by making 333 different three-dimensional worlds, and by challenging heroes in each world, with everyone being entertained by the one hero who could win the challenges, Superman. This led to Mxyzptlk becoming the king&#x27;s favorite entertainer, and winning the love of the king&#x27;s daughter, Gsptlnz. However, it also caused jealousy in the now-deposed original court magician, Vyndktvx. Vyndktvx eventually went mad and tried to kill Mxyzptlk, only to kill the king instead. The instant of the murder of the king, committed with the Multispear - a hyper-weapon - reflected in the three-dimensional universe Superman inhabits as a lifelong struggle with the five-dimensional being. Mxyzptlk and his beloved wife descended to the three-dimensional universe to aid Superman in his struggle; their mortal forms perished in due time, still in the same instant in the time of their home world. There, even as he was defeated in the three-dimensional universe, Vndyktvx was arrested and imprisoned for the murder. Mxyzptlk became king and lived happily with his wife, the beautiful princess-now-queen, only to grieve as she died giving birth to their children. And so, he became the sad king that one day, the jester Mxyzptlk would come to entertain, and who would be slain by Vndyktvx in an eternal cycle.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
After the &quot;New 52&quot; Superman died and Pre-&quot;52&quot; Superman took his place by the time of the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; reboot, a mysterious Clark Kent appeared claiming to be the real one. Despite everyone&#x27;s hesitations and the previous event that outed Clark as Superman, the new Clark had the medical records to match, and when Superman questioned Clark with a telepathic probe, Clark presented a clear history of Clark Kent as a human being who was orphaned at three months old and subsequently adopted by the Kents. Pre-&quot;52&quot; Lois investigates the new Clark more after getting her job back at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Clark asks Lois out on a date which she accepts, but on the date, Lois finds that Clark rented the whole place out for the night and proposed to her, scaring her out of the date. He follows Lois to her secret home and finds out about her marriage to Superman and their son, Jonathan. The next day, after spotting Clark, Superman and Lois&#x27;s house and Jonathan suddenly disappear. They track Clark down to his apartment, where he reveals himself to be the pre-52 Mister Mxyzptlk, who was absent from the &quot;New 52&quot; universe because he was held captive by Mister Oz and used his powers to transform and brainwash himself into believing he was Clark Kent to avoid getting recaptured after escaping. His attacks on Superman are revenge for failing to notice he has been missing and he proceeds to make Lois forget about her own son. As even Lois forgets that Clark and Superman were the same person, Superman agrees to play Mister Mxyzptlk&#x27;s game to try and win back the &#x27;right&#x27; to see his son again, but although Mister Mxyzptlk attempts to change the rules and ensure his victory, Jonathan is able to fight through his Mister Mxyzptlk-created prison with the aid of unspecified spirits that are revealed to be the &quot;New 52&quot; versions of Superman and Lois, culminating in the creation of a new timeline where the essence of the Post-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; Lois and Clark are fused with their pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; selves, so that the history of both worlds can co-exist.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister Mxyzptlk possesses the ability to warp reality, which has been described alternatively as the product of fifth dimensional magic or their technology, which is so advanced that, to third dimensional beings, it looks like magic. He is virtually immortal and omnipotent. Attendant with his abilities is the fact that Mxyzptlk himself is not limited by physical laws: he needs no sustenance such as air or water, can exist in any environment, can teleport anywhere, and is not susceptible to physical harm. His only apparent vulnerability is that whenever he speaks his name backwards, he is shunted back to the fifth dimension, and all effects of his magic vanish. This also has occurred with an indirect application of that rule; on one occasion, Mxyzptlk was banished by a backward-played tape recording of his own voice saying his name.

However, such a banishment is a temporary deterrent. After 90 days, Mxyzptlk can again visit the third dimension at will. His reality-warping powers exist in the fifth dimension, but he exerts less control compared to the third dimension, due to the presence of other imps with the same powers.

Though arguably the most powerful of Superman&#x27;s recurring enemies, the scope of Mxyzptlk&#x27;s true potential is limited by his personality. His gullible nature makes it easy for Superman or other individuals to trick him into saying his name backwards, and he is overall a fun-loving prankster who prefers to use his power for childish mischief and light-hearted harassment rather than malicious destruction or torment. Thus, he is more of an annoyance than a true threat.

The only exception to this aspect of his personality is the aforementioned interpretation by Alan Moore in &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;, where Mr Mxyzptlk shows the darker side of his omnipotence: his reality-manipulating powers go as far as to make him act as a puppeteer manoeuvring powerful characters such as Bizarro, Brainiac, Lex Luthor and the Legion of Super-Villains.

==Pronunciation==

Due to the phonetic difficulties in pronouncing a name spelled without vowels such as Mxyzptlk, it has been pronounced in various ways by various sources over the past four decades. On the 1967 Filmation CBS Superman animated series, it was pronounced as &quot;Mix-yez-PITTLE-ik&quot;; sources indicate that was the official DC Comics version of the time, furnished to the show&#x27;s writers through DC Comics editor/writer E. Nelson Bridwell. During the 1980s, on the &quot;Super Friends&quot; cartoon, produced by Hanna-Barbera, it was approximated as &quot;Mix-ill-plick&quot;. &quot;Miks-yez-pit-lik&quot; is actually a general translation and other variations have included &quot;Mix-yez-PIT-lek&quot;, &quot;Mix-yez-PIT-ul-ick&quot;, and &quot;Mix-yez-pittle-ik&quot;. To further complicate matters, Mxyzptlk says himself in the 1990s of &quot;Superman&quot;, that his name is pronounced the same as saying the words &quot;mix, yes, spit, lick&quot;, even transforming himself into the appropriate illustrations for the words. Clark had pronounced his name as &quot;Mix-ill-plick&quot; before Mxyzptlk popped out of the comic and proceeded to correct him. In his appearance in the &quot;Superman Returns&quot; video game, Mxyzptlk proudly refers to himself as &quot;the one and only Mr. Mix-yiz-SPIT-Lik!, straight from the fifth dimension!&quot; &quot;Miks-il-piti-lik&quot; (with the &quot;i&quot;″s pronounced only lightly) was used on &quot;Smallville&quot;, all while the original spelling of his name was pronounced &quot;mix-pit-tulk&quot;. This has created great confusion and even debate as to how his name is actually to be spoken.

In &quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; #10 (2007), &quot;Superman&#x27;s Top 10 Most Wanted&quot; describes Mister Mxyzptlk and provides the pronunciation as &quot;Mix-yez-pittle-ik&quot;, exactly like the 1967 animated series. So, phonetically, the pronunciation backwards would be &quot;Kell-tipp-ZEY-skim&quot;. Confusingly, the 1967 animated series used the backwards pronunciation &quot;Kulp-ti-mix-im&quot;. It is fair to say that producers were free to interpret the name any way they wanted, just as they routinely changed other elements of comic lore to suit their various series.

<doc id="512635" wikidata="Q1315428" url="?curid=512635" title="Sri Lanka blue magpie">
<text>The Sri Lanka blue magpie or Ceylon magpie (Urocissa ornata) is a brightly coloured member of the family Corvidae, found exclusively in Sri Lanka. This species is adapted to hunting in the dense canopy, where it is highly active and nimble. Its flight is rather weak, though, and is rarely used to cover great distances. In spite of the Sri Lanka blue magpie&#x27;s ability to adapt to the presence of humans, it is classified as vulnerable to extinction due to the fragmentation and destruction of its habitat of dense primary forest in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka.

== Description ==
The Sri Lanka blue magpie measures 42–47 cm in length, and is larger than a mynah, but smaller than a crow, with a sturdy bill. Its plumage is bright blue, with a reddish-brown or chestnut head, neck, and wing. The blue tail is long and graduated, with a white tip. The bill, legs, feet, and featherless eye ring of this species are all vibrant red. Both the male and female of the species share this description. The juvenile of this species has a plumage similar to that of an adult, but overall duller, with a brown eye ring and a greyish hue to its blue feathers, especially on its underside. Moulting season for Sri Lanka blue magpies is from August to November.

== Taxonomy ==
The Sri Lanka blue magpie is a member of the order Passeriformes, in the family Corvidae.

This species belongs to &quot;Urocissa&quot;, a genus of Southeast Asian magpies, of which there are 5 known species total. They share a recent common ancestor with another genus of Asian magpies,&quot; Cissa&quot;. Both &quot;Urocissa&quot; and &quot;Cissa&quot; are genera of the Oriental region, where the diversity of corvid species originated. They share a distant common ancestor with new world jays and magpies.

== Habitat and distribution ==
This species is endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is found in tall, undisturbed forest in the mountains, foothills, and adjoining lowlands of the wet zone. It is found from elevations of below 150 to 2150 m. It is not often seen in disturbed habitat such as gardens or plantations.

Surveys conducted from 2004 to 2006 found individuals of this species in 38 separate forest patches contained within six forest complexes within its range in the wet zone of southern Sri Lanka.

== Behaviour ==
In spite of their avoidance of human-disturbed habitats, the Sri Lanka blue magpie tolerates and is even attracted to the presence of humans. In response to low and moderate levels of recreational disturbance, and small to medium-sized groups of human visitors, numbers of Sri Lanka blue magpies increased, unlike other birds. A group of individuals was often observed waiting near trails, expecting to be fed by groups of human visitors.

=== Vocalizations ===
The Sri Lanka blue magpie produces a great variety of vocalizations, including a jingle, a &quot;chink-chink, crakrakrakrak,&quot; and a &quot;whee-whee&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Thirteen different common call types have been identified for the Sri Lanka blue magpie, including mimicry calls. Individuals have been recorded using two raptor calls quite frequently, usually while mobbing a predator (the &quot;Accipiter&quot; high-pitched call and the mountain hawk-eagle (&quot;Nisaetus nipalensis kelaarti&quot;) call) These raptor calls are mimicked by another species that occupies the same region, the greater racket-tailed drongo (&quot;Dicrurus paradiseus&quot;), implying that these imitated predator calls can act as alarm signals for multiple species.

Sri Lanka blue magpies do not just imitate the calls of predators, however. They have been observed mimicking the calls and songs of other birds in their prolonged and elaborate subsong.

=== Diet ===
These birds use their strong legs and feet to forage, and have been observed hanging upside down and holding down their prey with ease.

Their diet is mainly carnivorous, featuring insects, frogs, and small lizards, but they have been known to consume fruit, as well, and some observations suggest that they also prey on eggs or young of other bird species. Sri Lanka blue magpies have been observed rubbing hairy caterpillars against mossy branches to remove irritating hairs prior to consuming them.

=== Reproduction ===
Sri Lanka blue magpies are monogamous, use co-operative breeding to raise their young, and can be seen in small flocks of up to seven birds, while each bird maintains a territory.

The generation length of Sri Lanka blue magpies is 6.7 years. Breeding season is from January through March, and three to five eggs, which are white covered with brown spots, are laid in a clutch. Cup-shaped nests are built atop small, slender trees and lined with soft materials like lichen.

Both sexes build the nest and feed offspring, with only the female incubating them.

== Conservation status ==
The Sri Lanka blue magpie is listed as vulnerable, due to the fragmentation and ongoing decline of the population. Surveys performed in 2004-2006 estimate the population at 10,181-19,765 individuals, although their breeding strategy of monogamy and co-operative breeding has led to that estimate being reduced to 9,500-19,500 individuals total to reflect their effective population size.

The main threat to the survival of the Sri Lanka blue magpie is habitat loss due to forest being cleared for agricultural land, mines, logging, and human settlement. A moratorium on logging in wet zones in 1990, plus the legal protection of this species in Sri Lanka, have the potential to slow their population decline, but air pollution causing forest die-back and the use of biocides in the hill country continue to threaten the Sri Lanka blue magpie.

One of the factors preventing the Sri Lanka blue magpie from moving into disturbed habitat has been suggested to be the presence of another bird, the Asian koel (&quot;Eudynamys scolopaceus)&quot;, which is a brood parasite.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as () in Sinhala. The blue magpie appears on a 10c Sri Lankan postal stamp, which was in wide usage in the 1980s through 1990s.

<text>USS &quot;Siboney&quot; (ex-Frosty Bay) was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

==Design==

In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Siboney&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
===Construction and World War II===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship, originally named &quot;Frosty Bay&quot;, was built by the Todd-Pacific Shipyards at Tacoma, Washington. Her keel was laid down in 1 April 1944, and on 26 April she was renamed &quot;Siboney&quot;, after the village in Cuba where American forces invaded Cuba during the Spanish–American War. The ship was commissioned on 14 May 1945. Fitting out work lasted for another nine days, and was done in Seattle. On 31 May, the ship departed for San Diego, California, passing through Alameda on the way. She then conducted a shakedown cruise in the San Diego area, which concluded on 3 August.

The ship&#x27;s crew then began loading aircraft and ammunition, and the pilots of Air Group 36 came aboard. By 8 August, the ship got underway for the western Pacific, where she was to join the Japan campaign. On 15 August, the Japan announced it would surrender, ending the war; &quot;Siboney&quot; arrived in Pearl Harbor the following day, and so she unloaded her cargo and remained in Hawaiian waters for the rest of the month. In early September, she departed for Okinawa, Japan, passing through the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and the Philippines on the way. She arrived in Buckner Bay later that month.

&quot;Siboney&quot; left Okinawa on 5 October, bound for the main island of Honshu. While on the way, she contributed aircraft to search operations attempting to locate the Martin PBM Mariner that had been carrying Rear Admiral William Sample, which had gone missing on 2 October. &quot;Siboney&quot; stopped at various ports on Honshu from 8 to 11 October, before rejoining the search effort, which failed to locate the missing plane. &quot;Siboney&quot; then sailed to Tokyo Bay, from which she operated between 24 October and 16 November. She was then ordered to return to the United States, by way of Manila in the Philippines; Hong Kong, China; Saipan and Guam in the Mariana Islands; and Pearl Harbor. She eventually reached San Diego on 23 January 1946. She made another cruise in the western Pacific from 15 February to 7 May.

===Atlantic Fleet operations===
On 9 June 1947, &quot;Siboney&quot; left San Diego, bound for the East Coast of the United States. She passed through the Panama Canal and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, which was her new home port, on 26 June. Over the following four months, she cruised between Norfolk and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in November she was laid up in reserve status. The ship was reactivated in March 1948 to transport US Air Force aircraft to Turkey in May. After crossing the Atlantic, entering the Mediterranean Sea, and unloading the planes in Yesilkoy, Turkey, she returned to Norfolk, made preparations for another cruise to the Mediterranean. In October, she was dry-docked at the Boston Naval Shipyard for an overhaul that lasted for three months. The ship left Boston in January 1949, bound for Guantanamo, where she carried out refresher training. She took part in routine operations with the Atlantic Fleet for the rest of the year, and on 6 December, she was again placed in reserve, this time at Philadelphia.

Following the start of the Korean War in June 1950, &quot;Siboney&quot; was reactivated on 22 November, as the US Navy needed to transfer active ships to the war zone. &quot;Siboney&quot; remained in the Atlantic Fleet during this period, and first went to sea on 2 February 1951. Again based out of Norfolk, she sailed south to Guantanamo for extensive training maneuvers that lasted from 27 February to 10 April. She then returned north, and in July, she cruised off Canada. She made another voyage into the Mediterranean from September to 14 November, in company with warships from other North Atlantic Treaty Organization fleets. In January 1952, she conducted tests and carrier qualifications with A-1 Skyraiders and F4U Corsairs. She also carried out a pair of tests with Marine helicopter units during this period to evaluate their &quot;vertical assault&quot; concept, which envisioned using helicopter-borne assaults in conjunction with an amphibious invasion.

Later that year, &quot;Siboney&quot; was docked at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for modernization; she returned to active service with the fleet on 20 January 1952. She took part in training operations in the Caribbean Sea and then formed the core of a anti-submarine hunter-killer group that operated together until August. On 16 September, she embarked on another cruise in the Mediterranean with elements of Sixth Fleet, which lasted until 1 December. &quot;Siboney&quot; passed the following two years participating in routine fleet training exercises that ranged from the coast of New England to the Caribbean. During this period, she also made training cruises to Spain with midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in the summer months. She underwent an overhaul at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard from 28 September 1954 to 22 January 1955. On 4 October, she embarked supplies as part of a response to a severe hurricane that had struck Tampico, Mexico. She used her helicopters to ferry supplies to the city and surrounding area until 19 October.

&quot;Siboney&quot; resumed operations with the Atlantic Fleet in January 1956. Normal patrol and training duties followed through most of May, until the 26th, when she departed for another Mediterranean cruise with Sixth Fleet. The voyage lasted until 6 July; after a brief period at Norfolk, she sailed north to Philadelphia on 27 July, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve four days later. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. &quot;Siboney&quot; was allocated to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, where she remained for more than a decade. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1970 before being sold to the Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation in 1971. She was then broken up for scrap metal.

<text>USS &quot;Rendova&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

She was originally assigned the name &quot;Mosser Bay&quot;. she was laid down by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., Tacoma, Washington, 15 June 1944; launched 29 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Anna-Marie H. Kurtz; and commissioned 22 October 1945, Capt. R. W. Ruble in command. She was completed at Willamette Iron and Steel Works.

==Design==


In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Rendova&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The ship, originally named &quot;Mosser Bay&quot;, was ordered on 23 January 1943, and on 6 November, before work had begun, she was renamed &quot;Rendova&quot; after the landings on Rendova that occurred earlier that year. She was laid down at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington, on 15 June 1944 and was launched on 28 or 29 December. She was commissioned on 22 October 1945, by which time World War II had already ended. The ship completed her shakedown cruise in January 1946 before being assigned to First Fleet the following month. She took part in training exercises off the West Coast of the United States in March, but as the Navy was drawing down its force levels after the war, &quot;Rendova&quot; was removed from active service with only a skeleton crew to maintain her. She remained laid up in San Diego, California, for the next year, during which time she served as a headquarters ship for Carrier Division 15.

&quot;Rendova&quot; was reactivated in early 1947, and she spent the rest of the year participating in training maneuvers held off the West Coast and in the Hawaii area. She was used as an aircraft transport in 1948, departing from San Francisco on 1 April with a cargo of North American T-6 Texan trainers, bound for Turkey. She arrived in Yesilkoy on 28 April and unloaded the aircraft before departing to return home on 4 May. She passed through the Suez Canal and then transited the Indian and Pacific Oceans on the way home, stopping in many foreign ports on the way to make goodwill visits. She reached San Diego on 1 July. Her stay there was brief, as she got underway again on 28 July, this time to China. She stopped in Qingdao from 23 to 27 August and then returned to San Diego by the end of September. She spent the rest of the year training off the California coast.

The ship made another voyage to Chinese waters in early 1949, visiting Qingdao once again. She patrolled between that port and Okinawa, Japan, until mid-April, when she departed to return to California. After arriving, she rejoined First Fleet and took part in training exercises for much of the rest of the year. She sailed to Bremerton, Washington, in October, for an overhaul in preparation to being decommissioned on 27 January 1950. She was then assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===Korean war===
Following the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which initiated the Korean War, &quot;Rendova&quot; was recommissioned on 3 January 1951. The ship was operational by April, and on 3 July, she departed for East Asia. She arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, on 2 August and then sailed south to Okinawa for combat training. She then sailed back to mainland Japan in September, arriving in Kobe on the 20th. There, she replaced her sister ship as the carrier for Task Group 95.1. On 22 September, she embarked Marine squadron VMF-212, which was equipped with Vought F4U Corsair fighters. The following day, she carried out carrier training for the pilots, and then loaded ammunition and supplies at Sasebo, Japan on the 24th. She departed Japan on 25 September for her operational area in the Yellow Sea.

After arriving on station, she relieved the British aircraft carrier and began combat operations off the western coast of Korea on 26 September. Her aircraft supported American and South Korean ground forces fighting ashore, flew search and rescue missions, assisted enforcing a blockade of North Korean ports, and performed reconnaissance flights over enemy positions. Over the course of the next two months, her aircraft flew a total of 1,743 sorties, and on 17 November, the pilots of VMF-212 established a one-day record for escort carriers of 64 individual sorties. Throughout this period, she alternated with the Australian aircraft carrier . &quot;Rendova&quot; completed her combat tour on 6 December, departing to return to the United States soon thereafter. The ship earned two battle stars for her service during the war.

===Later career===
&quot;Rendova&quot; arrived in San Diego on 22 December, remaining there into January 1952. She thereafter re-joined First Fleet for training exercises for much of the rest of the year. She left the United States in September to participate in Operation Ivy, a series of two nuclear weapons tests in the Marshall Islands. Following the experiments, she returned to California, where she was placed in reserve, but still in commission, in 1953. Later that year, she took part in training exercises off the coast of California. She returned to full commission in 1954 for another cruise in the western Pacific. She served as a hunter-killer anti-submarine carrier during the voyage. By mid-June, she had returned to California, and she spent the next several months taking part in maneuvers off Long Beach, California. In October, she moved to Mare Island Naval Shipyard to be deactivated again. By this time, the Navy had begun replacing the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships with much larger s, since the former were too small to operate newer and more effective anti-submarine patrol planes. Proposals to radically rebuild the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;s either with an angled flight deck and various structural improvements or lengthen their hulls by and replace their propulsion machinery to increase speed came to nothing, as they were deemed to be too expensive. Assigned again to the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 2 February 1955, &quot;Rendova&quot; was allocated to the San Francisco Group and was decommissioned there on 30 June. The ship was reclassified as an aircraft ferry and cargo ship, with the hull number AKV-14 in 1959. &quot;Rendova&quot; saw no further activity, however, and on 1 April 1971, she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was eventually sold to ship breakers on 12 December 1972.

<text>USS &quot;Puget Sound&quot; was a of the United States Navy. The &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were built during World War II, and were an improvement over the earlier , which were converted from oil tankers. They were capable of carrying an air group of 33 planes and were armed with an anti-aircraft battery of , , and  guns. The ships were capable of a top speed of , and due to their origin as tankers, had extensive fuel storage.

==Design==
In 1941, as United States participation in World War II became increasingly likely, the US Navy embarked on a construction program for escort carriers, which were converted from transport ships of various types. Many of the escort carrier types were converted from C3-type transports, but the s were instead rebuilt oil tankers. These proved to be very successful ships, and the , authorized for Fiscal Year 1944, were an improved version of the &quot;Sangamon&quot; design. The new ships were faster, had improved aviation facilities, and had better internal compartmentation. They proved to be the most successful of the escort carriers, and the only class to be retained in active service after the war, since they were large enough to operate newer aircraft.

&quot;Puget Sound&quot; was long overall, with a beam of at the waterline, which extended to at maximum. She displaced at full load, of which could be fuel oil (though some of her storage tanks were converted to permanently store seawater for ballast), and at full load she had a draft of . The ship&#x27;s superstructure consisted of a small island. She had a complement of 1,066 officers and enlisted men.

The ship was powered by two Allis-Chalmers geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller, using steam provided by four Combustion Engineering-manufactured water-tube boilers. The propulsion system was rated to produce a total of for a top speed of . Given the very large storage capacity for oil, the ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class could steam for some at a speed of .

Her defensive anti-aircraft armament consisted of two  dual-purpose guns in single mounts, thirty-six Bofors guns, and twenty Oerlikon light AA cannons. The Bofors guns were placed in three quadruple and twelve twin mounts, while the Oerlikon guns were all mounted individually. She carried 33 planes, which could be launched from two aircraft catapults. Two elevators transferred aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck.

==Service history==
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The ship was part of this order, which was allocated to the Todd-Pacific Shipyards in Tacoma, Washington. She was originally laid down on 12 May 1944, under the name &quot;Hobart Bay&quot;, but on 5 June, the seaplane tender &quot;Puget Sound&quot; was renamed &quot;Salisburg Sound&quot; and &quot;Hobart Bay&quot; took the name &quot;Puget Sound&quot;. The new escort carrier was launched on 20 November, and after completing fitting out work, was commissioned into the fleet on 18 June 1945. The ship then conducted her initial sea trials, after which repairs and modifications were made at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, the ship&#x27;s namesake Navy facility. She got underway on 6 July for San Diego, California for a shakedown cruise. While in San Diego, she took on Marine Air Group (MAG) 6. On 8 September, she left for Pearl Harbor, where she took part in training exercises in preparation for occupation duties in Japan, which had recently surrendered, ending World War II.

On 14 October, &quot;Puget Sound&quot; arrived in Tokyo Bay. She contributed her aircraft to anti-mine patrols to clear the way for the Tenth United States Army to land at Matsuyama and Nagoya as part of the occupation force. She thereafter departed to participate in a cruise to the Philippines, Hong Kong, and then the Mariana Islands, during which she carried out various tactical training exercises. She embarked surplus aircraft while in Apra Harbor, Guam, before departing for Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1946. She unloaded the planes there and then proceeded on to San Diego, arriving there on 23 January. There, MAG 6 left the ship to clear room for &quot;Puget Sound&quot; to serve as a repatriation transport as part of Operation Magic Carpet. She made two such voyages between San Diego and Pearl Harbor, and another from Alameda, California, and Okinawa over the course of February to May. She transported some 1,200 returning veterans along with aircraft no longer needed in the western Pacific.

On 24 May, &quot;Puget Sound&quot; sailed north to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where she was prepared to be deactivated and assigned to the reserve. She was decommissioned on 18 October and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet based in Tacoma. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced in the ASW role by much larger s. On 12 June 1955, she was assigned the new hull number CVHE-113, and later that decade, she was reclassified as a cargo ship and aircraft transport, with the hull number AKV-13. She remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory until she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. She was sold to the Nicholai Joffee Corporation for scrap on 10 January 1962. She was then towed to Hong Kong, where she was broken up later that year.

==Service history==
===Construction and World War II===
The first fifteen ships of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot; class were ordered on 23 January 1943, allocated to Fiscal Year 1944. The carrier &quot;Totem Bay&quot; was among these ships, and she was laid down at the Todd-Pacific Shipyards at Tacoma, Washington, on 7 February 1944. On 26 April, she was renamed &quot;Vella Gulf&quot;, after the Battle of Vella Gulf, which had been fought between American and Japanese destroyer flotillas during the Solomons campaign the previous year. The ship was launched on 19 October 1944, and was commissioned into the fleet on 9 April 1945. The ship began sea trials in Puget Sound, and then departed for San Diego, California. She arrived there on 4 May and took on part of her Marine Corps air group to begin initial training and a shakedown cruise off the southern coast of California. Over the course of this period, she embarked the rest of her air complement.

&quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was docked for minor repairs and then left California on 17 June, stopping in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, eight days later. She remained there for eleven days of combat training to prepare her crew and pilots for wartime operations. She got underway again on 9 July, bound for the Mariana Islands. She stopped at Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands on 16 July on the way to refuel, and anchored in Guam on 20 July. Three days later, she sortied to conduct her first air strikes of the conflict, against Japanese positions on nearby Rota and Pagan Islands. The ship&#x27;s fighters—Vought F4U Corsairs and Grumman F6F Hellcats—and Grumman TBM Avenger bombers carried out a total of twenty-four sorties against Pagan on 24 July. A further twenty-one sorties struck Rota three days later. Japanese aircraft fire proved ineffective in both series of attacks, and all of her aircraft returned without serious damage.

The next day, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; transferred her aircraft to the air base at Saipan before returning to Guam on 2 August, anchoring in Apra Harbor for three days of rest and replenishment. On 5 August, she departed for Okinawa to join the Japan campaign, arriving in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on the 9th. That evening, word spread that Japan had entered surrender negotiations, prompting many of the ships and ground troops ashore to launch pyrotechnics in celebration. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; then returned to Guam, arriving there on 15 August, the day that Japan announced it would surrender. She soon returned north to participate in the initial occupation of Japan, providing logistical support to other Allied vessels. In late August, she and her sister ship provided air cover for one of the fleet replenishment groups. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; entered Tokyo Bay on 10 September. She was awarded one battle star for her short wartime service.

===Postwar and fate===
On 21 September, &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; sailed south to Okinawa, where she embarked some 650 men to bring them back to the United States. She stopped in Pearl Harbor on the way, and then proceeded on to San Francisco, California, arriving on 14 October. &quot;Vella Gulf&quot; was thereafter used as a training ship in Puget Sound for escort carrier crews for the next five months. In late March 1946, she moved to San Diego, arriving on the 27th. She remained there only briefly, however, before being ordered to return to Tacoma. After arriving on 30 March, she was docked to begin preparing the ship to be mothballed in the reserve fleet. On 7 April, she was moved to Seattle, Washington; on 9 August, she was formally decommissioned and placed in reserve as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet there. The ship was then moved to Tacoma, where she remained for several years. Ten of the &quot;Commencement Bay&quot;-class ships saw significant service postwar as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carriers, but they were small and had difficulty operating the new Grumman AF Guardian patrol planes, so the rest of the class remained laid up, and they were soon replaced in the ASW role by much larger s.

On 12 June 1955, she was reclassified as a helicopter carrier with the hull number CVHE-111, but she remained out of service. She was later given to the Military Sea Transportation Service, eventually being assigned the hull number T-AKV-11. She saw no further active service, however, and she was eventually struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960. Instead of being immediately discarded for scrap, she was reinstated to the register on 1 November, and remained in the Navy&#x27;s inventory for another decade. On 1 December 1970, she was struck a second time, and this time was sold to American Ship Dismantlers, Inc., of Portland, Oregon on 22 October 1971. She was thereafter broken up for scrap.

<doc id="512655" wikidata="Q240120" url="?curid=512655" title="Brabant killers">
<text>The Brabant killers are a group of unidentified criminals responsible for a series of violent attacks that mainly occurred in the Belgian province of Brabant between 1982 and 1985.

A total of 28 people died and 22 were injured. The actions of the gang, believed to consist of a core of three men, made it Belgium&#x27;s most notorious unsolved crime spree. The active participants were known as The &quot;Giant&quot; (; a tall man who may have been the leader); the &quot;Killer&quot; (&quot;Le Tueur&quot;; the main shooter) and the &quot;Old Man&quot; (&quot;Le Vieux&quot;; a middle-aged man who drove). The identities and whereabouts of the &quot;Brabant killers&quot; are unknown.

Although significant resources are still dedicated to the case, the most recent arrests connected to the case are of the now-retired original senior detectives themselves, for alleged evidence tampering.

The gang abruptly ceased their activities in 1985. The ensuing chaotic investigation failed to catch them or even make serious inroads into solving the case. This led to a parliamentary inquiry and public discussion, both of which revolved around the possibility that the gang members were Belgian or foreign state security elements either carrying out covert missions (disguising targeted assassinations) or conducting political terrorism.

The investigation into the case was officially closed in June 2024, but continued into 2025.

== Overview of crimes attributed to the gang ==

===1981===
* 31 December: Burglary at a Gendarmerie barracks in Etterbeek. Theft of automatic weapons, ammunition, and a car. Some of these items were later allegedly recovered in a garage belonging to Madani Bouhouche.

===1982===
* 13 March: Theft of a 10-gauge fowling shotgun from a store in Dinant, Belgium. Two men were seen running away. 
* 10 May: Theft at gunpoint of an Austin Allegro. One of two such instances in which the Killer was seen without a mask. He spoke French, apparently as a first language and with the inflexion of an educated man. The car was dumped almost immediately. Theft of a Volkswagen Santana from a car showroom.
* 14 August: Armed robbery of a grocery store in Maubeuge, France. Food and wine were stolen. Two French police officers were shot and seriously wounded when they arrived on the scene while the goods were being loaded into a vehicle.
* 30 September: Armed robbery of a weapons dealer in Wavre, Belgium. Fifteen firearms were stolen, including sub-machine guns. A police officer was killed at the scene; two others were shot and seriously wounded later.
* 23 December: Armed robbery of a restaurant in Beersel, Belgium. Coffee and wine were stolen. The caretaker was tortured and killed.

===1983===
* 9 January: Robbery and murder of a taxi driver in Brussels, Belgium. The car was later found in Mons, Belgium.
* 28 January: Theft of a Peugeot at gunpoint.
* 11 February: Armed robbery of a supermarket in Rixensart, Belgium. Less than $18,000 () was stolen. Several people were wounded. No one was killed. 
* 22 February: An Audi 100 with bullet holes from the 11 February incident was stolen from a commercial garage where it was being repaired, but quickly abandoned.
* 25 February: Armed robbery of a supermarket in Uccle, Belgium. Less than $16,000 () was stolen. No one was killed.
* 3 March: Armed robbery and murder at a supermarket in Halle, Belgium. Less than $18,000 () was stolen. One supermarket staff member was killed.
* 7 May: Armed robbery of a supermarket in Houdeng-Gougnies, Belgium. Less than $22,000 () was stolen. No one was killed.
* 10 September: Armed robbery and murder at a textile factory in Temse, Belgium. Seven bullet-proof jackets were stolen. A worker was killed and his wife was severely wounded. The firm had recently begun manufacturing the jackets (for the police) which was not widely known.
* 17 September: A couple were murdered in the early hours after stopping their Mercedes at a 24-hour self-service gas station beside a store that the gang was burgling. Despite the alarm going off, the gang took the time to load twenty kilos of tea and coffee and 10 litres of cooking oil. Two gendarmes responding to the alarm were shot as they arrived on the scene; one was killed, the other seriously wounded. The gang escaped in a Saab turbo stolen on 22 February and the murdered couple&#x27;s Mercedes. After shooting up a police car that began following them, the gang used a little-known minor road to get away in the Saab; after unsuccessful attempts to destroy the car by shooting the petrol tank, they left it near the garage from which the Audi had been stolen (also linked to the Volkswagen hijacked in 1982, and close to the Delhaize supermarket that would be attacked on September 27, 1985). Investigators believe that the repeated may indicate that some members lived in the area. Potentially crucial evidence collected from the Saab &#x27;disappeared&#x27;.
* 2 October: Armed robbery of a restaurant in Ohain, Belgium. Nothing was stolen. The owner was killed.
* 7 October: Armed robbery of a supermarket in Beersel, Belgium. Less than $35,000 () was stolen. One customer was killed.
* 1 December: Armed robbery of a shop in Anderlues and murder of the couple who owned it. About 3,000 Euros of jewellery was stolen. The owner&#x27;s wife was instantly killed without warning as the gang entered. The owner attempted to defend himself with a pistol but was shot dead. The gang destroyed a surveillance camera recording before leaving. The stolen Volkswagen used had fake license plates copied from a legitimately owned Volkswagen of the same model that was linked to the garage where the Audi was taken, and where the new Volkswagen taken at gunpoint in 1982 was bought.

===1985===
* 27 September: Armed robbery at the Delhaize supermarket on rue de la Graignette in Braine-l&#x27;Alleud. Less than $6,000 () was stolen. Three people were killed and two wounded. Between 15 and 25 minutes later, there was an armed robbery of the Delhaize supermarket on Brusselsesteenweg in Overijse. Less than $25,000 () was stolen. Five people were killed and one wounded.

As a result of these robberies, security was increased at many stores in the region — including armed guards.

* 9 November: around 7:30 p.m.: Armed robbery at the Delhaize supermarket on the Parklaan in Aalst. This market was outside the area the gang usually operated in. They arrived while an armed patrol that checked the supermarket was still present. A family of four encountered the perpetrators in the parking lot after they left the shop and the mother, father, and daughter were killed apparently without motive. The surviving boy from the family ran back into the shop where he was singled out and shot at point-blank range; he was very badly wounded in the hip. Less than $25,000 was taken, and eight people were killed with several others seriously injured. Gang members (wearing bizarre face paint and disguises) roared at and taunted customers. They also were reportedly laughing and smiling during the gratuitous shootings, which were done by the &quot;Killer&quot;. The robbers did not leave the scene right away after returning to their parked getaway vehicle. The patrol vehicle from Belgium&#x27;s Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie backed some distance away when the shooting started; the municipal police arrived, although many of their cars had refused to start, but mainly remained at an exit of the parking lot that was well away from the gang. The getaway began with the &quot;Giant&quot; walking alongside the getaway car. A policeman fired his revolver at the gang&#x27;s VW, which went through an unblocked exit and sped away. Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie vehicles stayed put, but a police van pursued the gang for a few kilometres.

In November 1986, the discovery in a canal of various items and weapons taken or used in the gang&#x27;s crimes provided important evidence. A long-running dispute erupted over the find, amid assertions that the location was checked in 1985; therefore the weapons could not have been there from before that time and a second search must have been done with guilty knowledge. In 2019, the now-retired officers responsible for ordering the 1986 search were officially questioned on suspicion of manipulating the investigation, but they protested that the original search of the canal was not an underwater inspection by frogmen, as done in 1986. A Volkswagen Golf car — similar to that used in the getaway — had been found burned out in 1985 in woods relatively close to the canal, however, it was said the condition of the items meant they could not have been immersed since that time.

==Method of operation==
The items taken and paraphernalia they disposed of seemed to indicate that the gang were shooting enthusiasts involved in drug dealing and burglaries, combining their criminal activity with daytime jobs such as food preparation or scrap metal dealing. Under this interpretation, the crimes were largely for material reward and escalated out of bravado. On the other hand, odd elements were also evident:
* Robbery proceeds were modest relative to the extreme risks. Early raids were often amateurish – for example, the Giant not wearing gloves, and the Killer and the Old Man allowing themselves to be seen without masks while taking a car at gunpoint.
* The pause in the raids and the killings followed by the escalated resumption in 1985, when a nine-year-old girl and other bystanders were shot dead for no reason in the parking lot before the gang had entered the supermarkets.
* Firearms were a particular interest; the 12-gauge pump shotguns used were loaded with a rare buckshot similar to that used by Group Diane (a former special forces unit of the Belgian Gendarmerie). Some policemen thought the gang used tactics in gunfights very similar to those taught in police courses.
* The cars used, often Volkswagens, were stripped of distinctive trim and had vehicle modifications including repainting, indicating a mechanic&#x27;s facilities and expertise, but also a desire to retain VW parts.
* Getaway routes were well planned and navigated at top speed, but the gang were often still on the scene when armed police arrived.

The gang is believed to have had at least one helper on its last raid. In 1986, weapons that the gang had were found along with bulletproof jackets and other items in a canal about 30 km outside Brussels. The Winchester pump shotguns used in the massacres were never found.

== Ulterior motives ==

=== Official complicity ===
Certain events surrounding the robbery of the Delhaize supermarket in Aalst on 9 November 1985 served to further strengthen media-fuelled rumours of a connection between the gang and elements of the Belgian military and the Belgian Gendarmerie in particular. For example, the supermarket was hit despite patrols passing it every twenty minutes and gendarmes close to the scene did not engage or pursue the robbers. Although no such connection has been officially proven, the lack of satisfactory performance in the Brabant killers&#x27; case was among the reasons for the subsequent abolishing of the Belgian Gendarmerie.

A connection to the clandestine stay-behind network S.D.R.A VIII (Operation Gladio) has also been suggested. However, an official parliamentary inquiry found no substantive evidence that the network was involved in any terrorist acts or that criminal groups had infiltrated it.

A supposed connection between the Brabant killers, Gladio, and the by-then defunct Belgian far-right organisation Westland New Post led by Paul Latinus is mentioned in the 1992 BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; documentary series &quot;Operation Gladio&quot;, directed by Allan Francovich, in which it is suggested that Latinus said that his organisation was sanctioned by the Belgian government.

=== Westland New Post ===
In March 1981, Paul Latinus and members of Front de la Jeunesse founded Westland New Post, a paramilitary far-right group that was investigated after a 1980 incident in which a member shot at a group of North Africans, causing one death and a national outcry. The killer was with a firearms enthusiast who was a friend of police officer Madani Bouhouche, and decades later let him stay in a French property after Bouhouche was released on licence from a life sentence for two murders. The milieu of WNP included a former member (now deceased) of the French terrorist group OAS, and several others from the Front de la Jeunesse who conducted paramilitary firearms training in some of the forested areas that were later used by the Brabant killers. The WNP was a secret organisation. Speculation about a connection to the Brabant killers increased after former WNP members — including the only Gendarmerie — recalled being ordered to covertly surveil and compile a report on security arrangements at Belgian supermarkets of a large chain that was targeted by the killers. WNP had a genuine intelligence operative advising on covert techniques; NATO behind-the-lines units are known to have used the planning of robberies as a training exercise. Michel Libert, the former second-in-command of Westland New Post, admitted passing on Latinus&#x27;s orders to gather detailed information on supermarkets with a view to robberies, but denied knowing of any purpose to the assignments beyond developing clandestine skills.

Marcel Barbier, an enforcer-type WNP member who lived with Libert, was arrested in August 1983 after a shooting, and became suspected in a double murder at a synagogue a year earlier. Latinus went to police and informed them that Barbier and another WNP member had committed the synagogue murders, and that he (Latinus) had helped Barbier get rid of the murder weapon. This caused dissension within the WNP as Latinus was seen as having betrayed a member of the organisation. Also in 1983 several members of WNP who were in Front de la Jeunesse (Belgium) were convicted of organising it as an illegal militia, and given terms in prison. Leading WNP members were also arrested for unauthorised possession of low-level classified NATO documents. Latinus committed suicide in April 1984, and his followers formed rival cliques. Some theories have connected these facts to the inactivity of the Brabant Killers gang between December 1983 and September 1985, and them having a seemingly intensified grudge against society during the supermarket massacres of 27 September and 9 November 1985.

Barbier was convicted for the synagogue murders. His co-accused, WNP member Eric Lammers, was acquitted of murder but received 5 years for other offences, and in 1991 was convicted of a separate double murder. Lammers fled the country after being accused of a sexual exposure against a child and accessing images of child sex abuse. After he was brought back from Serbia he appeared in a 2014 Belgian TV program in which he accused WNP leaders of being behind the Brabant killings, based on WNP reconnaissance on the supermarket chain whose premises were subjected to the murderous attacks of 1985. Libert was arrested as a suspect soon after the program was broadcast, but released without charge after 48 hours. In 2018 a former subordinate of Libert publicly accused him of being the &#x27;Giant&#x27;, although without any official reaction. Libert went on television to yet again deny the allegations, and said the accuser had mental health difficulties.

===Other speculation===
Various conspiracy theories link the killings to political scandals, illegal gun-running mafias, and legitimate businesses, suggesting they were done to disguise targeted assassinations. It has been suggested that one of the supposed victims of these assassinations was the banker Léon Finné, who was shot by the gang during the robbery of the Delhaize supermarket in Overijse on 27 September 1985.

== Possible suspects ==
Notorious professional criminals, including Patrick Haemers and Madani Bouhouche (both now dead) have been canvassed as likely suspects. Haemers&#x27;s height made him an apparent fit for the Brabant gang&#x27;s &#x27;Giant&#x27;, but his known crimes lacked the gratuitous violence and small-time takings that were the Brabant killers&#x27; hallmark.

Bouhouche was a former gendarme and gun shop owner suspected and known to have been involved in a number of violent crimes. He was arrested in 1986 for the murder of Juan Mendez, an acquaintance of his who had expressed his fear that some weapons stolen from him by Bouhouche had been used in the Brabant killers&#x27; crimes. Although he was released in 1988, police had found that Bouhouche had anonymously rented garages to store stolen cars, weapons he had stolen in a 1981 burglary of a Gendarmerie guard station in Etterbeek, and false duplicate car plates, some of which could have a connection to the Brabant killers. Also, items thought to have been abandoned by the Brabant killers turned out to include several TV remote controls adapted for triggering explosions, not unlike Bouhouche had intended to use in a complex extortion scheme involving IED attacks against a supermarket chain years before the Brabant killers started targeting supermarkets. This and all other evidence seemingly connecting him to the Brabant killers was considered inconclusive, but did little to allay the suspicion that he may have had inside information about the Brabant killers. He eventually died in 2005 while employed by a rental accommodation business owned by an old shooting and Westland New Post acquaintance.

== Investigation ==
In 1983, on the basis of a forensic examination of a weapon, and a witness who said he had seen the Saab hidden, authorities charged the gun owner (a former municipal policeman) and several other men (&quot;Borains&quot;) with the Brabant killings. Police said they obtained incriminating statements containing guilty knowledge. The Brabant killers&#x27; jewellery shop double murder occurred while the &quot;Borains&quot; accused were in detention. After it was found that a German ballistic experts&#x27; report discrediting the main hard evidence against the accused had been suppressed by the prosecutor, charges against the &quot;Borains&quot; were dismissed, and the freed men furiously alleged they had been coerced in abusive 36 hour interrogations, and supplied with details for false confessions. The original &quot;Borains&quot; suspect was unsuccessfully approached for information in 2015.

An initially promising lead for the enquiry concerned a member of a family of Romany origin that was well known in the underworld, who led a group of armed robbers. He was charged with being one of the Brabant Killers and at one point made (later retracted) admission to having participated without his gang in the massacres but provided no details, and the line of investigation proved fruitless.

The law enforcement agencies hunting the killers made many mistakes during the early years of the investigation, often as a result of rivalries among the various authorities. Among the worst oversights were the failure to preserve cars the gang modified and dumped, and the loss of items with fingerprints. The original investigating magistrate was criticized for lack of professionalism by mishandling evidence and not considering alternatives to his hypotheses. Publicity about the case and the offer of a substantial reward resulted in a vast number of tips from ordinary Belgians with personal scores to settle, thereby diverting investigative resources from viable suspects.

===Current lines of inquiry===
Most suspects date back to the beginning of the investigation, and have been repeatedly questioned over the years. The latest was Christiaan Bonkoffsky, ex-Gendarmerie unit &quot;Group Diane&quot;, who before his alcohol-related 2015 death made a confession to being the so-called Giant. A riot gun and ammunition basket labelled &quot;Gendarmerie-Politie&quot;, were apparently dumped by the Brabant killers (possibly after having been stolen by them). Bonkoffsky had already been scrutinised as a potential suspect in 2000. Investigators utilising forensic DNA and fingerprints have definitely ruled him out as the Giant.

In June 2020 Belgian detectives appealed for information on the identity of man in a photograph sent to police in 1986. They reissued a photo of a man holding a SPAS-12 in a forest. The photo was reissued on the orders of a judge. They also appealed for information on the identity of a man with a 3.5 cm wine stain birthmark on the nape of his neck who took part in one of the gang&#x27;s raids on a Delhaize supermarket in Beersel on the southern outskirts of Brussels in October 1983.

A special extension to the statute of limitations on the case runs out in 2025, by which time the core members of the gang would be in their mid seventies at least, if still alive.

On 28 June 2024, the investigation into the case was officially closed.

Federal prosecutors in Belgium announced on 28 January 2025 that a new lead emerged in the investigation and the criminal probe is ongoing. On 27 January 2025, a civil party in the city of Mons appealed to the courts and asked for two additional witnesses to be heard, and the appeal was approved. The two witnesses were present at the time of the Aalst attack on 9 November 1985. 

== In the media ==
* In 2018 Stijn Coninx directed the Belgian film &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot; (Niet Schieten), screenplay by Stijn Coninx and Rik D&#x27;Hiet. It is based on the last, 9 November 1985, bloody raid by the Brabant Killers on the Delhaize Supermarket in Aalst. Eight innocent people were murdered, among whom were Gilbert and Thérèse Van de Steen and their daughter Rebecca. Their nine-year-old son David although critically injured in the leg, survived the shooting and was raised by his grandparents. It follows the 25-year-long battle of David&#x27;s grandfather, Albert (played by Jan Decleir), to bring the killers to justice.
* In 2023, Belgian television channels Eén and La Une aired &quot;1985&quot;, a television series created by Wouter Bouvijn and Willem Wallyn focusing on the Brabant killers. A bilingual co-production between public broadcasters VRT and RTBF of Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia respectively, the series offers a coming-of-age crime drama perspective, following three youths — Marc, Vicky and her brother Franky — as they navigate the tumultuous early 1980s in Brussels, becoming entangled in the intrigue surrounding the gang, with diverging allegiances and the historical backdrop adding complexity. The series features notable Belgian music from the late 1970s to early 1980s, along with music from foreign artists such as The Psychedelic Furs, Gruppo Sportivo and The Clash.
* In early 2024, philosopher Ernesto de Montisalbi discusses the Brabant Killers in his novel &quot;Grievous Reminiscence&quot;, presenting them as a moral counterbalance to other criminal figures from the 1960s to the 1990s. He highlights striking similarities in facial features and modus operandi between members of this notorious gang and figures such as Salvatore Riina, Bernardo Riina, Matteo Messina Denaro, Bernardo Provenzano, Vincenzo Puccio and Pino Greco. This comparative analysis constructs a narrative that critically examines the ethical implications of their potential motivations and simultaneously scrutinizes the competence of the investigators in resolving their respective cases. It also interrogates the origins of malevolence, awareness of transgression, and the capacity for clemency towards perpetrators of criminal acts.

<doc id="512661" wikidata="Q5033392" url="?curid=512661" title="Canonization of Joan of Arc">
<text>Joan of Arc (1412–1431) was formally canonized as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 16 May 1920 by Pope Benedict XV in his bull &quot;Divina disponente&quot;, which concluded the canonization process that the Sacred Congregation of Rites instigated after a petition of 1869 of the French Catholic hierarchy. Although pro-English clergy had Joan burnt at the stake for heresy in 1431, she was rehabilitated in 1456 after a posthumous retrial. Subsequently, she became a folk saint among French Catholics and soldiers inspired by her story of being commanded by God to fight for France against England. Many French regimes encouraged her cult, and the Third Republic was sympathetic to the canonization petition prior to the 1905 separation of church and state.

==Path to sainthood==

===Death and 15th century===
As with other saints who were excommunicated or investigated by ecclesiastic courts, such as Athanasius, Teresa of Ávila, and John of the Cross, Joan was put on trial by an Inquisitorial court. In her case, the court was influenced by the English, which occupied northern France, leading to her execution in the marketplace of Rouen. When the French retook Rouen in 1449, a series of investigations were launched. Her now-widowed mother Isabelle Romée and Joan&#x27;s brothers Jéan and Pierre, who were with Joan at the Siege of Orléans, petitioned Pope Nicholas V to reopen her case. The formal appeal was conducted in 1455 by Jean Bréhal, Inquisitor-General of France, under the aegis of Pope Callixtus III. Isabelle addressed the opening session of the appellate trial at Notre Dame with an impassioned plea to clear her daughter&#x27;s name. Joan was exonerated on 7 July 1456, with Bréhal&#x27;s summary of case evidence describing her as being executed by a court which itself had violated Church law.

The city of Orléans had commemorated her death each year beginning in 1432, and from 1435 onward performed a religious play centered on the lifting of the siege. The play represented her as a divinely-sent savior guided by angels. In 1452, during one of the postwar investigations into her execution, Cardinal d&#x27;Estouteville declared that this play would merit qualification as a pilgrimage site by which attendees could gain an indulgence.

Not long after the appeal, Pope Pius II, who died in 1464, wrote an approving piece about her in his memoirs.

===16th century===
An anonymous author wrote a biography of Joan&#x27;s life, stating that it was compiled &quot;By order of the King, Louis XII of that name&quot; in circa 1500.

===18th and 19th centuries===

Joan&#x27;s cult of personality was opposed by the leaders of the French Revolution as she was a devout Catholic who had served the monarchy. They banned the yearly celebration of the lifting of the Siege of Orléans, and Joan&#x27;s relics, including her sword and banner, were destroyed. A statue of Joan erected by the people of Orléans in 1571 (to replace one destroyed by Protestants in 1568) was melted down and made into a cannon.

Recognizing he could use Joan for his nationalist purposes, Napoleon allowed Orléans to resume its yearly celebration of the lifting of the siege, commissioned Augustin Dupré to strike a commemorative coin, and had Jean-Antoine Chaptal inform the mayor of Orléans that he approved of a resolution by the municipal council for Edme-François-Étienne Gois to erect his statue of Joan: &quot;The illustrious career of Joan of Arc proves that there is no miracle French genius cannot perform in the face of a threat against national freedom.&quot; Gois&#x27;s work was relocated to Place Dauphiné in 1855, replaced with a statue of Joan by Denis Foyatier.

Although Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy and Clément Charles François de Laverdy are credited with the first full-length biographies of Joan, several English authors ironically sparked a movement which led to her canonization. Harvard University English literature professor Herschel Baker noted in his introduction to &quot;Henry VI&quot; for &quot;The Riverside Shakespeare&quot; how appalled William Warburton was by the depiction of Joan in &quot;Henry VI, Part 1&quot;, and that Edmond Malone sought in &quot;Dissertation on the Three Parts of Henry VI&quot; (1787) to prove Shakespeare had no hand in its authorship (1974; p. 587). Charles Lamb chided Samuel Taylor Coleridge for reducing Joan to &quot;a pot girl&quot; in the first drafts of &quot;The Destiny of Nations&quot;, initially part of Robert Southey&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. She was the subject of essays by Lord Mahon for &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot;, and by Thomas De Quincey for &quot;Tait&#x27;s&quot;. In 1890, the Joan of Arc Church was dedicated to her.

As Joan found her way further into popular culture, the Government of France commissioned Emmanuel Frémiet to erect a statue of her in the Place des Pyramides—the only public commission of the state from 1870 to 1914. The French Navy dedicated four vessels to her: a 52-gun frigate (1820); a 42-gun frigate (1852); an ironclad corvette warship (1867); and an armored cruiser (1899). Philippe-Alexandre Le Brun de Charmettes&#x27;s biography (1817), and Jules Quicherat&#x27;s account of her trial and rehabilitation (1841–1849) seemed to have inspired canonization efforts.

In 1869, to celebrate the 440th anniversary of the lifting of the Siege, Félix Dupanloup, Bishop of Orléans, delivered a second panegyric on Joan, attended by: Jean-François-Anne Landriot; Guillaume-René Meignan; Georges Darboy; Joseph-Alfred Foulon; Henri-Marie-Gaston Boisnormand de Bonnechose; Louis-Édouard-François-Desiré Pie; Joseph-Hippolyte Guibert; Charles Lavigerie; Charles-Amable de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne-Lauraguais, Bishop of Bourges; Félix-Joseph-François-Barthélemy de Las Cases, Bishop of Constantine; Joseph-Armand Gignoux, Bishop of Beauvais; Louis-Marie-Joseph-Eusèbe, Bishop of Saint-Dié; Louis-Théophile Pallu du Parc, Bishop of Blois; Emmanuel-Jules Ravinet, Bishop of Troyes; Augustin Hacquard, Bishop of Verdun; and Pierre-Marie-Gervais Lacarrière, former Bishop of Basse-Terre and Guadeloupe. Supported by Henri-Alexandre Wallon, Dupanloup submitted a petition to Pope Pius IX, signed by the aforementioned bishops, and other dignitaries, for Joan to be canonized, but the Franco-Prussian War postponed further action.

In 1874, depositions began to be collected, received by Cardinal Luigi Bilio in 1876. Dupanloup&#x27;s successor, Bishop Pierre-Hector Coullié, directed an inquest to authenticate her acts and testimony from her trial and rehabilitation. On 27 January 1894, the Curia (Cardinals Benedetto Aloisi-Masella, Angelo Bianchi, Benoît-Marie Langénieux, Luigi Macchi, Camillo Mazzella, Paul Melchers, Mario Mocenni, Lucido Parocchi, Fulco Luigi Ruffo-Scilla, and Isidoro Verga) voted unanimously that Pope Leo XIII sign the &quot;Commissio Introductionis Causæ Servæ Dei Joannæ d&#x27;Arc&quot;, which he did that afternoon.

===20th century to present===

However, the path to sainthood did not go smoothly. On 20 August 1902, the papal consistory rejected adding Joan to the Calendar of saints, citing: she launched the assault on Paris on the birthday of Mary, mother of Jesus; her capture (&quot;proof&quot; her claim that she was sent by God was false); her attempts to escape from prison; her abjure after being threatened with death; and doubts of her purity. On 17 November 1903, the Sacred Congregation of Rites met to discuss Joan&#x27;s cause at the behest of Pope Pius X. A decree proclaiming Joan&#x27;s heroic virtue was issued on 6 January 1904 by Cardinal Serafino Cretoni, and Pius proclaimed her venerable on 8 January. The Decree of the Three Miracles was issued on 13 December 1908, and The Decree of Beatification was read five days later, which was issued formally by the Congregation of Rites on 24 January 1909.

The beatification ceremony was held on 18 April 1909, presided by Cardinals Sebastiano Martinelli and Mariano Rampolla. Bishop Stanislas Touchet performed the Mass. Cardinals Serafino Vannutelli, Pierre Andrieu, Louis Luçon, Coullié, Girolamo Maria Gotti, José Calassanç Vives y Tuto, then-Monsignor Rafael Merry del Val, Bishop John Patrick Farrelly, Bishop Thomas Kennedy, Monsignor Robert Seton, Count Giulio Porro-Lambertenghi (grandson of Luigi Porro Lambertenghi) with tribunes from The Knights of Malta, The Duke of Alençon and The Duke of Vendôme, then-Archbishop William Henry O&#x27;Connell, and The Duke of Norfolk attended. Pius—who was determined that the ceremony would not be used by Legitimists to attack the Third Republic—venerated the relics that afternoon, flanked by 70 French prelates.

Her beatification approximately coincided with the French invention of the Janvier transfer engraving machine (also called a die engraving pantograph), which facilitates the creation of minted coins and commemorative medallions. This invention, together with the already well-established French sculptural tradition, added another element to Joan&#x27;s beatification: a series of well-made religious art medals featuring scenes from her life.

Edmond Richer&#x27;s &quot;La première histoire en date de Jeanne d&#x27;Arc: histoire de la Pucelle d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, written between 1625 and 1630, was published in two volumes in 1911 by Henri and Jules Desclée.

During World War I, French troops carried her image into battle with them. During one battle, they interpreted a German searchlight image projected onto low-lying clouds as an appearance by Joan, which bolstered their morale greatly. [see: &quot;The Maid of Orléans: The Story of Joan of Arc Told to American Soldiers&quot; by Charles Saroléa (1918)]

Her canonization was held on 16 May 1920. Over 60,000 people attended the ceremony, including 140 descendants of Joan&#x27;s family. Dignitaries included: Vendôme, Lambertenghi with The Knights of Malta, now-Bishop O&#x27;Connell, Gabriel Hanotaux, Princess Zinaida Yusupova, Princess Irina Alexandrovna, Prince Feodor Alexandrovich, The Duke of Braganza, The Count de Salis-Soglio, Rafael Valentín Errázuriz, Diego von Bergen, Bishop John Patrick Carroll, Archbishop Edward Joseph Hanna, Bishop Daniel Mary Gorman, Bishop Paul Joseph Nussbaum, the student body of The American College of Rome, and now-Cardinal Merry del Val, who greeted Pope Benedict XV as Benedict entered St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica to preside over the rites. The Latin bull of Pope Benedict XV effecting her canonization was &quot;Divina Disponente&quot; of the same date. Approximately 100,000 persons celebrated at Westminster Cathedral and French churches throughout London.

In the 18 May 1920 &quot;Le Matin&quot;, former President of France Raymond Poincaré wrote that Joan&#x27;s canonization &quot;fulfills the last part of her mission in bringing together forever in the sacredness of her memory&quot; one-time mortal enemies England and France: &quot;In her spirit, let us remain united for the good of Mankind&quot;.

==Popularity==

Joan of Arc&#x27;s feast day is 30 May. Although reforms in 1968 moved many medieval European saints&#x27; days off the general calendar in order to make room for more non-Europeans, her feast day is still celebrated on many local and regional Church calendars, especially in France. Many Catholic churches around the globe have been named after her in the decades since her canonization.

She has become especially popular among Traditional Catholics, particularly in France—both because of her obvious connection to this country as well as the fact that the Traditional Catholic movement is strongest there. This movement within the church, which includes those few orders and societies which refused to accept the changes made by the Second Vatican Council, has compared the 1988 excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre (one of the founders of the Society of Saint Pius X) to Joan of Arc&#x27;s excommunication by a corrupt pro-English bishop in 1431.

<text>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths. Coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease involve atherosclerosis. This may be caused by high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, excessive alcohol consumption, and poor sleep, among other things. High blood pressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco accounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6%, and obesity 5%. Rheumatic heart disease may follow untreated strep throat.
It is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable. Prevention of CVD involves improving risk factors through: healthy eating, exercise, avoidance of tobacco smoke and limiting alcohol intake. Treating risk factors, such as high blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial. Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females. Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In the United States 11% of people between 20 and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over 80 have CVD. The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80, while it is around 68 in the developing world. CVD is typically diagnosed seven to ten years earlier in men than in women.
==Types==

There are many cardiovascular diseases involving the blood vessels. They are known as vascular diseases.
* Coronary artery disease (coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease)
* Peripheral arterial disease – a disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and legs
* Cerebrovascular disease – a disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the brain (includes stroke)
* Renal artery stenosis
* Aortic aneurysm

There are also many cardiovascular diseases that involve the heart.
* Cardiomyopathy – diseases of cardiac muscle
* Hypertensive heart disease – diseases of the heart secondary to high blood pressure or hypertension
* Heart failure – a clinical syndrome caused by the inability of the heart to supply sufficient blood to the tissues to meet their metabolic requirements
* Pulmonary heart disease – a failure at the right side of the heart with respiratory system involvement
* Cardiac dysrhythmias – abnormalities of heart rhythm
* Inflammatory heart diseases
** Endocarditis – inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. The structures most commonly involved are the heart valves.
** Inflammatory cardiomegaly
** Myocarditis – inflammation of the myocardium, the muscular part of the heart, caused most often by viral infection and less often by bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. It is characterized in part by infiltration of the heart by lymphocyte and monocyte types of white blood cells.
** Eosinophilic myocarditis – inflammation of the myocardium caused by pathologically activated eosinophilic white blood cells. This disorder differs from myocarditis in its causes and treatments.
* Valvular heart disease
* Congenital heart disease – heart structure malformations existing at birth
* Rheumatic heart disease – heart muscles and valves damage due to rheumatic fever caused by &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; a group A streptococcal infection.

==Risk factors==
There are many risk factors for heart diseases: age, sex, tobacco use, physical inactivity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, obesity, genetic predisposition and family history of cardiovascular disease, raised blood pressure (hypertension), raised blood sugar (diabetes mellitus), raised blood cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), undiagnosed celiac disease, psychosocial factors, poverty and low educational status, air pollution, and poor sleep. While the individual contribution of each risk factor varies between different communities or ethnic groups the overall contribution of these risk factors is very consistent. Some of these risk factors, such as age, sex or family history/genetic predisposition, are immutable; however, many important cardiovascular risk factors are modifiable by lifestyle change, social change, drug treatment (for example prevention of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes). People with obesity are at increased risk of atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries.

===Genetics===
Cardiovascular disease in a person&#x27;s parents increases their risk by ~3 fold, and genetics is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic cardiovascular disease can occur either as
a consequence of single variant (Mendelian) or polygenic influences. There are more than 40 inherited cardiovascular disease that can be traced to a single disease-causing DNA variant, although these conditions are rare. Most common cardiovascular diseases are non-Mendelian and are thought to be due to hundreds or thousands of genetic variants (known as single nucleotide polymorphisms), each associated with a small effect.

===Age===
Age is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with approximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life. Coronary fatty streaks can begin to form in adolescence. It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart disease are 65 and older. Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubles every decade after age 55.

Multiple explanations are proposed to explain why age increases the risk of cardiovascular/heart diseases. One of them relates to serum cholesterol level. In most populations, the serum total cholesterol level increases as age increases. In men, this increase levels off around age 45 to 50 years. In women, the increase continues sharply until age 60 to 65 years.

Aging is also associated with changes in the mechanical and structural properties of the vascular wall, which leads to the loss of arterial elasticity and reduced arterial compliance and may subsequently lead to coronary artery disease.

===Sex===

Men are at greater risk of heart disease than pre-menopausal women. Once past menopause, it has been argued that a woman&#x27;s risk is similar to a man&#x27;s although more recent data from the WHO and UN disputes this. If a female has diabetes, she is more likely to develop heart disease than a male with diabetes. Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy.

Coronary heart diseases are 2 to 5 times more common among middle-aged men than women. In a study done by the World Health Organization, sex contributes to approximately 40% of the variation in sex ratios of coronary heart disease mortality. Another study reports similar results finding that sex differences explains nearly half the risk associated with cardiovascular diseases One of the proposed explanations for sex differences in cardiovascular diseases is hormonal difference. Among women, estrogen is the predominant sex hormone. Estrogen may have protective effects on glucose metabolism and hemostatic system, and may have direct effect in improving endothelial cell function. The production of estrogen decreases after menopause, and this may change the female lipid metabolism toward a more atherogenic form by decreasing the HDL cholesterol level while increasing LDL and total cholesterol levels.

Among men and women, there are differences in body weight, height, body fat distribution, heart rate, stroke volume, and arterial compliance. In the very elderly, age-related large artery pulsatility and stiffness are more pronounced among women than men. This may be caused by the women&#x27;s smaller body size and arterial dimensions which are independent of menopause.

===Tobacco===
Cigarettes are the major form of smoked tobacco. Risks to health from tobacco use result not only from direct consumption of tobacco, but also from exposure to second-hand smoke. Approximately 10% of cardiovascular disease is attributed to smoking; however, people who quit smoking by age 30 have almost as low a risk of death as never smokers.

===Physical inactivity===

Insufficient physical activity (defined as less than 5 x 30 minutes of moderate activity per week, or less than 3 x 20 minutes of vigorous activity per week) is currently the fourth leading risk factor for mortality worldwide. In 2008, 31.3% of adults aged 15 or older (28.2% men and 34.4% women) were insufficiently physically active.
The risk of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus is reduced by almost a third in adults who participate in 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week (or equivalent). In addition, physical activity assists weight loss and improves blood glucose control, blood pressure, lipid profile and insulin sensitivity. These effects may, at least in part, explain its cardiovascular benefits.

===Diet===

High dietary intakes of saturated fat, trans-fats and salt, and low intake of fruits, vegetables and fish are linked to cardiovascular risk, although whether all these associations indicate causes is disputed. The World Health Organization attributes approximately 1.7 million deaths worldwide to low fruit and vegetable consumption. Frequent consumption of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity and may increase cardiovascular risk. The amount of dietary salt consumed may also be an important determinant of blood pressure levels and overall cardiovascular risk. There is moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least two years reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. High trans-fat intake has adverse effects on blood lipids and circulating inflammatory markers, and elimination of trans-fat from diets has been widely advocated. In 2018 the World Health Organization estimated that trans fats were the cause of more than half a million deaths per year. There is evidence that higher consumption of sugar is associated with higher blood pressure and unfavorable blood lipids, and sugar intake also increases the risk of diabetes mellitus. High consumption of processed meats is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly in part due to increased dietary salt intake.

=== Alcohol ===

The relationship between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease is complex, and may depend on the amount of alcohol consumed. There is a direct relationship between high levels of drinking alcohol and cardiovascular disease. Drinking at low levels without episodes of heavy drinking may be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but there is evidence that associations between moderate alcohol consumption and protection from stroke are non-causal. At the population level, the health risks of drinking alcohol exceed any potential benefits.

===Celiac disease===
Untreated celiac disease can cause the development of many types of cardiovascular diseases, most of which improve or resolve with a gluten-free diet and intestinal healing. However, delays in recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease can cause irreversible heart damage.

===Sleep===

A lack of good sleep, in amount or quality, is documented as increasing cardiovascular risk in both adults and teens. Recommendations suggest that infants typically need 12 or more hours of sleep per day, adolescents at least eight or nine hours, and adults seven or eight. About one-third of adult Americans get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, and in a study of teenagers, just 2.2 percent of those studied got enough sleep, many of whom did not get good quality sleep. Studies have shown that short sleepers getting less than seven hours sleep per night have a 10 percent to 30 percent higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

Sleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing and insomnia, are also associated with a higher cardiometabolic risk.
An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans have insomnia, sleep apnea or other chronic sleep disorders.

In addition, sleep research displays differences in race and class. Short sleep and poor sleep tend to be more frequently reported in ethnic minorities than in whites. African-Americans report experiencing short durations of sleep five times more often than whites, possibly as a result of social and environmental factors. Black children and children living in disadvantaged neighborhoods have much higher rates of sleep apnea.

===Socioeconomic disadvantage===
Cardiovascular disease has a greater impact on low- and middle-income countries compared to those with higher income. Although data on the social patterns of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries is limited, reports from high-income countries consistently demonstrate that low educational status or income are associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Policies that have resulted in increased socio-economic inequalities have been associated with greater subsequent socio-economic differences in cardiovascular disease implying a cause and effect relationship. Psychosocial factors, environmental exposures, health behaviours, and health-care access and quality contribute to socio-economic differentials in cardiovascular disease. The Commission on Social Determinants of Health recommended that more equal distributions of power, wealth, education, housing, environmental factors, nutrition, and health care were needed to address inequalities in cardiovascular disease and non-communicable diseases.

===Air pollution===
Particulate matter has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure effects on cardiovascular disease. Currently, airborne particles under 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. Overall, long-term PM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 μg/m3 of PM2.5 resulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk. In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and diastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 μg/m3 of PM2.5. Other research has implicated PM2.5 in irregular heart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure. PM2.5 is also linked to carotid artery thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.

===Cardiovascular risk assessment===
Existing cardiovascular disease or a previous cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke, is the strongest predictor of a future cardiovascular event. Age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, blood lipids and diabetes are important predictors of future cardiovascular disease in people who are not known to have cardiovascular disease. These measures, and sometimes others, may be combined into composite risk scores to estimate an individual&#x27;s future risk of cardiovascular disease. Numerous risk scores exist although their respective merits are debated. Other diagnostic tests and biomarkers remain under evaluation but currently these lack clear-cut evidence to support their routine use. They include family history, coronary artery calcification score, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), ankle–brachial pressure index, lipoprotein subclasses and particle concentration, lipoprotein(a), apolipoproteins A-I and B, fibrinogen, white blood cell count, homocysteine, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), and markers of kidney function. High blood phosphorus is also linked to an increased risk.

===Depression and traumatic stress===
There is evidence that mental health problems, in particular depression and traumatic stress, is linked to cardiovascular diseases. Whereas mental health problems are known to be associated with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as smoking, poor diet, and a sedentary lifestyle, these factors alone do not explain the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases seen in depression, stress, and anxiety. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder is independently associated with increased risk for incident coronary heart disease, even after adjusting for depression and other covariates.

=== Occupational exposure ===

Little is known about the relationship between work and cardiovascular disease, but links have been established between certain toxins, extreme heat and cold, exposure to tobacco smoke, and mental health concerns such as stress and depression.

====Non-chemical risk factors====
A 2015 SBU-report looking at non-chemical factors found an association for those:
* with mentally stressful work with a lack of control over their working situation — with an effort-reward imbalance
* who experience low social support at work; who experience injustice or experience insufficient opportunities for personal development; or those who experience job insecurity
* those who work night schedules; or have long working weeks
* those who are exposed to noise

Specifically the risk of stroke was also increased by exposure to ionizing radiation. Hypertension develops more often in those who experience job strain and who have shift-work. Differences between women and men in risk are small, however men risk having and dying of heart attacks or stroke twice as often as women during working life.

====Chemical risk factors====
A 2017 SBU report found evidence that workplace exposure to silica dust, engine exhaust or welding fumes is associated with heart disease. Associations also exist for exposure to arsenic, benzopyrenes, lead, dynamite, carbon disulphide, carbon monoxide, metalworking fluids and occupational exposure to tobacco smoke. Working with the electrolytic production of aluminium or the production of paper when the sulphate pulping process is used is associated with heart disease. An association was also found between heart disease and exposure to compounds which are no longer permitted in certain work environments, such as phenoxy acids containing TCDD(dioxin) or asbestos.

Workplace exposure to silica dust or asbestos is also associated with pulmonary heart disease. There is evidence that workplace exposure to lead, carbon disulphide, phenoxyacids containing TCDD, as well as working in an environment where aluminum is being electrolytically produced, is associated with stroke.

=== Somatic mutations ===
As of 2017, evidence suggests that certain leukemia-associated mutations in blood cells may also lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Several large-scale research projects looking at human genetic data have found a robust link between the presence of these mutations, a condition known as clonal hematopoiesis, and cardiovascular disease-related incidents and mortality.

===Radiation therapy===
Radiation treatments (RT) for cancer can increase the risk of heart disease and death, as observed in breast cancer therapy. Therapeutic radiation increases the risk of a subsequent heart attack or stroke by 1.5 to 4 times; the increase depends on the dose strength, volume, and location. Use of concomitant chemotherapy, e.g. anthracyclines, is an aggravating risk factor. The occurrence rate of RT induced cardiovascular disease is estimated between 10% and 30%.

Side-effects from radiation therapy for cardiovascular diseases have been termed &quot;radiation-induced heart disease&quot; or &quot;radiation-induced cardiovascular disease&quot;. Symptoms are dose-dependent and include cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, valvular heart disease, coronary artery disease, heart arrhythmia and peripheral artery disease. Radiation-induced fibrosis, vascular cell damage and oxidative stress can lead to these and other late side-effect symptoms.

==Pathophysiology==

Population-based studies show that atherosclerosis, the major precursor of cardiovascular disease, begins in childhood. The Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth (PDAY) study demonstrated that intimal lesions appear in all the aortas and more than half of the right coronary arteries of youths aged 7–9 years.

Obesity and diabetes mellitus are linked to cardiovascular disease, as are a history of chronic kidney disease and hypercholesterolaemia. In fact, cardiovascular disease is the most life-threatening of the diabetic complications and diabetics are two- to four-fold more likely to die of cardiovascular-related causes than nondiabetics.

==Screening==
Screening ECGs (either at rest or with exercise) are not recommended in those without symptoms who are at low risk. This includes those who are young without risk factors. In those at higher risk the evidence for screening with ECGs is inconclusive. Additionally echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, and cardiac stress testing is not recommended in those at low risk who do not have symptoms. Some biomarkers may add to conventional cardiovascular risk factors in predicting the risk of future cardiovascular disease; however, the value of some biomarkers is questionable. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and coronary artery calcium, are also of unclear benefit in those without symptoms as of 2018.

The NIH recommends lipid testing in children beginning at the age of 2 if there is a family history of heart disease or lipid problems. It is hoped that early testing will improve lifestyle factors in those at risk such as diet and exercise.

Screening and selection for primary prevention interventions has traditionally been done through absolute risk using a variety of scores (ex. Framingham or Reynolds risk scores). This stratification has separated people who receive the lifestyle interventions (generally lower and intermediate risk) from the medication (higher risk). The number and variety of risk scores available for use has multiplied, but their efficacy according to a 2016 review was unclear due to lack of external validation or impact analysis. Risk stratification models often lack sensitivity for population groups and do not account for the large number of negative events among the intermediate and low risk groups. As a result, future preventative screening appears to shift toward applying prevention according to randomized trial results of each intervention rather than large-scale risk assessment.

==Prevention==
Up to 90% of cardiovascular disease may be preventable if established risk factors are avoided. Currently practised measures to prevent cardiovascular disease include:
* Maintaining a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian, vegan or another plant-based diet.
* Replacing saturated fat with healthier choices: Clinical trials show that replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by 30%. Prospective observational studies show that in many populations lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD.
* Decrease body fat if overweight or obese. The effect of weight loss is often difficult to distinguish from dietary change, and evidence on weight reducing diets is limited. In observational studies of people with severe obesity, weight loss following bariatric surgery is associated with a 46% reduction in cardiovascular risk.
* Limit alcohol consumption to the recommended daily limits. People who moderately consume alcoholic drinks have a 25–30% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. However, people who are genetically predisposed to consume less alcohol have lower rates of cardiovascular disease suggesting that alcohol itself may not be protective. Excessive alcohol intake increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and consumption of alcohol is associated with increased risk of a cardiovascular event in the day following consumption.
* Decrease non-HDL cholesterol. Statin treatment reduces cardiovascular mortality by about 31%.
* Stopping smoking and avoidance of second-hand smoke. Stopping smoking reduces risk by about 35%.
* At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate exercise per week.
* Lower blood pressure, if elevated. A 10 mmHg reduction in blood pressure reduces risk by about 20%. Lowering blood pressure appears to be effective even at normal blood pressure ranges.
* Decrease psychosocial stress. This measure may be complicated by imprecise definitions of what constitute psychosocial interventions. Mental stress–induced myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of heart problems in those with previous heart disease. Severe emotional and physical stress leads to a form of heart dysfunction known as Takotsubo syndrome in some people. Stress, however, plays a relatively minor role in hypertension. Specific relaxation therapies are of unclear benefit.
* Not enough sleep also raises the risk of high blood pressure. Adults need about 7–9 hours of sleep. Sleep apnea is also a major risk as it causes breathing to stop briefly, which can put stress on the body which can raise the risk of heart disease.

Most guidelines recommend combining preventive strategies. There is some evidence that interventions aiming to reduce more than one cardiovascular risk factor may have beneficial effects on blood pressure, body mass index and waist circumference; however, evidence was limited and the authors were unable to draw firm conclusions on the effects on cardiovascular events and mortality.

There is additional evidence to suggest that providing people with a cardiovascular disease risk score may reduce risk factors by a small amount compared to usual care. However, there was some uncertainty as to whether providing these scores had any effect on cardiovascular disease events. It is unclear whether or not dental care in those with periodontitis affects their risk of cardiovascular disease. According to a 2021 WHO study, working 55+ hours a week raises the risk of stroke by 35% and the risk of dying from heart conditions by 17%, when compared to a 35-40 hours week.

===Diet===

A diet high in fruits and vegetables decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death.

A 2021 review found that plant-based diets can provide a risk reduction for CVD if a healthy plant-based diet is consumed. Unhealthy plant-based diets do not provide benefits over diets including meat. A similar meta-analysis and systematic review also looked into dietary patterns and found &quot;that diets lower in animal foods and unhealthy plant foods, and higher in healthy plant foods are beneficial for CVD prevention&quot;. A 2018 meta-analysis of observational studies concluded that &quot;In most countries, a vegan diet is associated with a more favourable cardio-metabolic profile compared to an omnivorous diet.&quot;

Evidence suggests that the Mediterranean diet may improve cardiovascular outcomes. There is also evidence that a Mediterranean diet may be more effective than a low-fat diet in bringing about long-term changes to cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., lower cholesterol level and blood pressure).

The DASH diet (high in nuts, fish, fruits and vegetables, and low in sweets, red meat and fat) has been shown to reduce blood pressure, lower total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and improve metabolic syndrome; but the long-term benefits have been questioned. A high-fiber diet is associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease. 

Worldwide, dietary guidelines recommend a reduction in saturated fat, and although the role of dietary fat in cardiovascular disease is complex and controversial there is a long-standing consensus that replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat in the diet is sound medical advice. Total fat intake has not been found to be associated with cardiovascular risk. A 2020 systematic review found moderate quality evidence that reducing saturated fat intake for at least 2 years caused a reduction in cardiovascular events. A 2015 meta-analysis of observational studies however did not find a convincing association between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular disease. Variation in what is used as a substitute for saturated fat may explain some differences in findings. The benefit from replacement with polyunsaturated fats appears greatest, while replacement of saturated fats with carbohydrates does not appear to have a beneficial effect. A diet high in trans fatty acids is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease, and in 2015 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that there was &#x27;no longer a consensus among qualified experts that partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), which are the primary dietary source of industrially produced trans fatty acids (IP-TFA), are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for any use in human food&#x27;. There is conflicting evidence concerning whether dietary supplements of omega-3 fatty acids (a type of polyunsaturated essential fatty acid) added to diet improve cardiovascular risk.
The benefits of recommending a low-salt diet in people with high or normal blood pressure are not clear. In those with heart failure, after one study was left out, the rest of the trials show a trend to benefit. Another review of dietary salt concluded that there is strong evidence that high dietary salt intake increases blood pressure and worsens hypertension, and that it increases the number of cardiovascular disease events; both as a result of the increased blood pressure &quot;and&quot; probably through other mechanisms. Moderate evidence was found that high salt intake increases cardiovascular mortality; and some evidence was found for an increase in overall mortality, strokes, and left ventricular hypertrophy.

==== Intermittent fasting ====

Overall, the current body of scientific evidence is uncertain on whether intermittent fasting could prevent cardiovascular disease. Intermittent fasting may help people lose more weight than regular eating patterns, but was not different from energy restriction diets.

===Medication===
Blood pressure medication reduces cardiovascular disease in people at risk, irrespective of age, the baseline level of cardiovascular risk, or baseline blood pressure. The commonly-used drug regimens have similar efficacy in reducing the risk of all major cardiovascular events, although there may be differences between drugs in their ability to prevent specific outcomes. Larger reductions in blood pressure produce larger reductions in risk, and most people with high blood pressure require more than one drug to achieve adequate reduction in blood pressure. Adherence to medications is often poor, and while mobile phone text messaging has been tried to improve adherence, there is insufficient evidence that it alters secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Statins are effective in preventing further cardiovascular disease in people with a history of cardiovascular disease. As the event rate is higher in men than in women, the decrease in events is more easily seen in men than women. In those at risk, but without a history of cardiovascular disease (primary prevention), statins decrease the risk of death and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease. The benefit, however, is small. A United States guideline recommends statins in those who have a 12% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease over the next ten years. Niacin, fibrates and CETP Inhibitors, while they may increase HDL cholesterol do not affect the risk of cardiovascular disease in those who are already on statins. Fibrates lower the risk of cardiovascular and coronary events, but there is no evidence to suggest that they reduce all-cause mortality.

Anti-diabetic medication may reduce cardiovascular risk in people with Type 2 diabetes, although evidence is not conclusive. A meta-analysis in 2009 including 27,049 participants and 2,370 major vascular events showed a 15% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular disease with more-intensive glucose lowering over an average follow-up period of 4.4 years, but an increased risk of major hypoglycemia.

Aspirin has been found to be of only modest benefit in those at low risk of heart disease, as the risk of serious bleeding is almost equal to the protection against cardiovascular problems. In those at very low risk, including those over the age of 70, it is not recommended. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against use of aspirin for prevention in women less than 55 and men less than 45 years old; however, it is recommended for some older people.

The use of vasoactive agents for people with pulmonary hypertension with left heart disease or hypoxemic lung diseases may cause harm and unnecessary expense.

Antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease

Antibiotics may help patients with coronary disease to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, evidence in 2021 suggests that antibiotics for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease are harmful, with increased mortality and occurrence of stroke; the use of antibiotics is not supported for preventing secondary coronary heart disease.

=== Physical activity ===
Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation following a heart attack reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and leads to less hospitalizations. There have been few high-quality studies of the benefits of exercise training in people with increased cardiovascular risk but no history of cardiovascular disease.

A systematic review estimated that inactivity is responsible for 6% of the burden of disease from coronary heart disease worldwide. The authors estimated that 121,000 deaths from coronary heart disease could have been averted in Europe in 2008 if people had not been physically inactive. Low-quality evidence from a limited number of studies suggest that yoga has beneficial effects on blood pressure and cholesterol. Tentative evidence suggests that home-based exercise programs may be more efficient at improving exercise adherence.

===Dietary supplements===
While a healthy diet is beneficial, the effect of antioxidant supplementation (vitamin E, vitamin C, etc.) or vitamins has not been shown to protect against cardiovascular disease and in some cases may possibly result in harm. Mineral supplements have also not been found to be useful. Niacin, a type of vitamin B3, may be an exception with a modest decrease in the risk of cardiovascular events in those at high risk. Magnesium supplementation lowers high blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. Magnesium therapy is recommended for people with ventricular arrhythmia associated with torsades de pointes who present with long QT syndrome, and for the treatment of people with digoxin intoxication-induced arrhythmias. There is no evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is beneficial. A 2022 review found that some dietary supplements, including micronutrients, may reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

==Management==
Cardiovascular disease is treatable with initial treatment primarily focused on diet and lifestyle interventions. Influenza may make heart attacks and strokes more likely and therefore influenza vaccination may decrease the chance of cardiovascular events and death in people with heart disease.

Proper CVD management necessitates a focus on MI and stroke cases due to their combined high mortality rate, keeping in mind the cost-effectiveness of any intervention, especially in developing countries with low or middle-income levels. Regarding MI, strategies using aspirin, atenolol, streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator have been compared for quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in regions of low and middle income. The costs for a single QALY for aspirin and atenolol were less than US$25, streptokinase was about $680, and t-PA was $16,000. Aspirin, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and statins used together for secondary CVD prevention in the same regions showed single QALY costs of $350.

There are also surgical or procedural interventions that can save someone&#x27;s life or prolong it. For heart valve problems, a person could have surgery to replace the valve. For arrhythmias, a pacemaker can be put in place to help reduce abnormal heart rhythms and for a heart attack, there are multiple options two of these are a coronary angioplasty and a coronary artery bypass surgery.

There is probably no additional benefit in terms of mortality and serious adverse events when blood pressure targets were lowered to ≤ 135/85 mmHg from ≤ 140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg.

==Epidemiology==

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide and in all regions except Africa. In 2008, 30% of all global death was attributed to cardiovascular diseases. Death caused by cardiovascular diseases are also higher in low- and middle-income countries as over 80% of all global deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases occurred in those countries. It is also estimated that by 2030, over 23 million people will die from cardiovascular diseases each year.

It is estimated that 60% of the world&#x27;s cardiovascular disease burden will occur in the South Asian subcontinent despite only accounting for 20% of the world&#x27;s population. This may be secondary to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Organizations such as the Indian Heart Association are working with the World Heart Federation to raise awareness about this issue.

==Research==

There is evidence that cardiovascular disease existed in pre-history, and research into cardiovascular disease dates from at least the 18th century. The causes, prevention, and/or treatment of all forms of cardiovascular disease remain active fields of biomedical research, with hundreds of scientific studies being published on a weekly basis.

Recent areas of research include the link between inflammation and atherosclerosis the potential for novel therapeutic interventions, and the genetics of coronary heart disease.

<text>Chita (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Zabaykalsky Krai, Russia, located on the Trans-Siberian Railway route, roughly east of Irkutsk and roughly west of Khabarovsk. Population: 

==History==
Pyotr Beketov&#x27;s Cossacks founded Chita in 1653.
The name of the settlement came from the local River Chita.

Following the Decembrist revolt of 1825, from 1827 several of the Decembrists suffered exile to Chita.
According to George Kennan, who visited the area in the 1880s, &quot;Among the exiles in Chita were some of the brightest, most cultivated, most sympathetic men and women that we had met in Eastern Siberia.&quot;

When Richard Maack visited the city in 1855, he saw a wooden town, with one church, also wooden. He estimated Chita&#x27;s population at under 1,000, but predicted that the city would soon experience fast growth, due to the upcoming annexation of the Amur valley by Russia.

By 1885, Chita&#x27;s population had reached 5,728, and by 1897 it increased to 11,500. In 1897 the Trans-Siberian Railway reached Chita; rail traffic from 1899 rapidly made Chita the transport hub and industrial centre of the Transbaikal.

During the Russian Revolution of 1905, revolutionary socialists declared the Chita Republic. Tsarist government forces took control again in January 1906.

The Bolsheviks took power in Chita in February 1918. The Imperial Japanese Army occupied Chita from September 1918 to 1920 in the course of the Siberian intervention. On behalf of the White movement, Ataman Grigory Semyonov&#x27;s Eastern Okraina ruled from Chita for some few months in early 1920 with Japanese support. From October 1920 to November 1922 the city served as the capital of the Far Eastern Republic, which became part of the RSFSR in November 1922.

In 1945, the Soviet authorities held Puyi, who had reigned (1908–1912, 1917) as the last Emperor of China, and some of his associates as prisoners in the city, in a former sanatorium for officers.

==Geography==
Chita lies at the confluence of the Chita and Ingoda Rivers, between the Yablonoi Mountains to the west and the Chersky Range to the east. Lake Kenon is located to the west, within the city limits, and the Ivan-Arakhley Lake System is a group of lakes lying about west of Chita.

===Climate===
Chita experiences a dry-winter borderline humid continental climate/subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwb/Dwc&quot;, Trewartha climate classification &quot;Dcbc/Ecbc&quot;) with very cold, very dry winters and warm, relatively wet summers. Despite the southerly latitude, it closely resembles the climate of Fairbanks, Alaska.
== Administrative and municipal status ==
Chita is the administrative center of Zabaykalsky Krai, and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Chitinsky District, to which it is also subordinated. As a municipal division, the city of Chita together with one rural locality in Chitinsky District is incorporated as Chita Urban Okrug.

==City districts==
The city is subdivided into four administrative districts: Chernovsky (named after the Chernovskiye coal mines and colloquially known as &quot;Chernovskiye&quot;), Ingodinsky (named after the Ingoda River), Tsentralny, and Zheleznodorozhny.
Chernovsky Administrative District used to be a mining settlement, which was incorporated into Chita in 1941. Chernovskiye mines themselves are a geological nature monument of international status.

==Transportation==
Chita is served by Kadala Airport, situated 15 km to the west.

==Education==
Chita is home to several facilities of higher education:
*Transbaikal State University (formerly Chita State University)
*Chita State Academy of Medicine

==Military==
Chita Northwest air base is located nearby, as well as the 101st (Hub) Communications Brigade and the 53rd Material Support Regiment. 

A submarine is named after the city.

==Sports==

<doc id="512667" wikidata="Q6082562" url="?curid=512667" title="Islamic Party of Britain">
<text>The Islamic Party of Britain is a defunct political party in the United Kingdom that was active from its formation in 1989 until 2006. The IPB was opposed to both capitalism and communism. David Musa Pidcock, a Sheffield man who converted from Roman Catholicism to Islam while working as an engineer in Saudi Arabia, founded and led the party. The IPB published a quarterly magazine entitled &quot;Common Sense&quot;.

The party entered the 1992 general election, standing three unsuccessful candidates in the constituencies of Bradford, a city with a large Muslim minority, and one in a London constituency, Streatham.

== Founding ==
The Islamic Party of Britain was founded in September 1989 by Muslims who had grown dissatisfied with the Labour Party, a party that has traditionally gained the support of Muslims in Britain. Many Muslims were unhappy with the atheism of Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, and wanted a party that would cater specifically for the needs of Muslims. Many also felt that both Labour and the Conservatives had not done enough to help Muslims in the controversy over Salman Rushdie&#x27;s book &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;.

==Performance==
The Islamic Party never achieved a seat in either house of Parliament. Pidcock represented the party in the 1990 Bradford North by-election, earning 800 votes (2.2%), finishing fourth from ten candidates.

At the 1992 general election, the party stood candidates in each of the three constituencies in the City of Bradford. All finished in last place, with leader Pidcock in Bradford West performing best, on 471 votes (0.96%). It also stood a candidate in Streatham, coming fifth of seven candidates.

==Relations with other parties==
In its first year, Pidcock claimed that his party was planning co-operation with the Green Party.

Members of the party have supported the Respect Party; one of their leading members, home affairs spokesman Mohammad Naseem, stood for and funded the party.

==Policies==
The party believed in equal treatment under the law regardless of an individual&#x27;s status, income or ethnicity. The IPB argued that religion is the most important thing in life. It called for reform of the British banking system to make it interest-free and Islamic, and for increased trade with the Islamic world. At one time, the party answered questions sent in by readers of its website. When answering one question, the party argued that homosexuality needed treatment, was not to be tolerated and that homosexuals should be put to death for a &quot;public display of lewdness&quot;, a policy that was condemned by gay activist Peter Tatchell.

<doc id="512673" wikidata="Q1502508" url="?curid=512673" title="Gyrocar">
<text>A gyrocar is a two-wheeled automobile. The difference between a bicycle or motorcycle and a gyrocar is that in a bike, dynamic balance is provided by the rider, and in some cases by the geometry and mass distribution of the bike itself, and the gyroscopic effects from the wheels. Steering a motorcycle is done by precessing the front wheel. In a gyrocar, balance was provided by one or more gyroscopes, and in one example, connected to two pendulums by a rack and pinion.

The concept was originally described in fiction in 1911 &quot;Two Boys in a Gyrocar: The story of a New York to Paris Motor Race&quot; by Kenneth Brown, (Houghton Mifflin Co). However the first prototype Gyrocar, The Shilovski Gyrocar, was commissioned in 1912 by the Russian Count Pyotr Shilovsky, a lawyer and member of the Russian royal family. It was manufactured to his design by the Wolseley Tool and Motorcar Company in England in 1914 and demonstrated in London the same year. The gyrocar was powered by a modified Wolseley C5 engine of , with a bore of 90 mm and a stroke of 121 mm. It was mounted ahead of the radiator, driving the rear wheel through a conventional clutch and gear box. A transmission brake was fitted after the gearbox – there were no brakes on the wheels themselves. The weight of the vehicle was 2.75 tons and it had a very large turning radius.

In 1927, Louis Brennan, funded to the tune of £12,000 (plus a £2000 per year) by John Cortauld, built a rather more successful gyrocar. Two contra-rotating gyros were housed under the front seats, spun in a horizontal plane at 3500 rpm by 24V electric motors powered from standard car batteries. This was the greatest speed obtainable with the electric motors available, and meant that each rotor had to weigh to generate sufficient forces. Precession was in the vertical fore-aft plane. The car had a Morris Oxford engine, engine mountings, and gearbox. Two sidewheels (light aircraft tailwheels were used) were manually lowered on stopping; if the driver forgot and switched off the gyros and walked away, the car would continue to balance itself using the gyro momentum for a few minutes, and then the wheels would automatically be dropped to stop tipping.

<doc id="512677" wikidata="Q21190269" url="?curid=512677" title="The Ugly Little Boy">
<text>&quot;The Ugly Little Boy&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. The story first appeared in the September 1958 issue of &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; under the title &quot;Lastborn&quot;, and was reprinted under its current title in the 1959 collection &quot;Nine Tomorrows&quot;. The story deals with a &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; child which is brought to the future by means of time travel. Robert Silverberg later expanded it into a novel with the same title published in 1992 (also published as &quot;Child of Time&quot; in the UK).

Asimov has said that this was his second or third favorite of his own stories.

==Plot summary==
A Neanderthal child is brought to the present day as a result of time travel experiments by Stasis Inc, a research organization. He cannot be removed from his immediate area because of the vast energy loss and time paradoxes that would result, and is kept in the present by way of a Stasis module. In order to care for the boy the organization hires Edith Fellowes, a children&#x27;s nurse.

Initially repelled by the boy&#x27;s appearance, Edith soon begins to regard him as her own child, learning to love him and realizing that he is far more intelligent than she first imagined. She dubs him &#x27;Timmie&#x27; and attempts to ensure that he has the best possible childhood despite his circumstance. She is enraged when the newspapers refer to him as an &quot;ape-boy.&quot; Edith&#x27;s love for Timmie brings her into conflict with her employer, for whom he is more of an experimental animal than a human being.

Eventually, her employer comes to the conclusion that his organization has exacted all the knowledge and publicity it can from Timmie and that the time has come to move on to the next project. This involves bringing a medieval peasant into the present, which necessitates the return of Timmie to his own time. Edith fights the decision, knowing the boy cannot survive if returned to his own time due to his acquisition of modern dependencies and speech. She attempts to smuggle the boy out of the facility, but when that plan fails she disrupts the integrity of the Stasis module and returns to the ancient past with Timmie.

==Television adaptation==

In 1977, &quot;The Ugly Little Boy&quot; was made into a 26-minute telefilm in Canada. The film was directed by and stars Barry Morse. London-born actress Kate Reid played the role of Nurse Fellowes. Guy Big, in his last role, played the boy. The film is noteworthy for its fidelity to the short story, as well as the pathos between Timmy and Nurse Fellowes which garnered praise from both fans and reviewers. The film was named to the ALA Notable Children&#x27;s Films list in 1977.

==Novelization==
The 1991 novelization of the same title (published as &quot;Child of Time&quot; in the UK) expands on the short story by introducing Timmie&#x27;s original Neanderthal tribe as well as a children&#x27;s advocacy group that seeks to liberate Timmie. The Neanderthals are shown sympathetically as a highly articulate people whose tribal society and culture is complex and sophisticated, a far cry from the &quot;primitive brutes&quot; which the future scientists consider them to have been, having only the fragmentary information derived from a little Neanderthal child. This Neanderthal society—shown mainly from the point of view of an assertive tribal woman determined to prove herself the equal of the male hunters/warriors—is suddenly faced with the appearance of a completely different, competing kind of human being: the Cro-Magnons. While the Cro-Magnons try to negotiate with the Neanderthals, they cannot communicate and understand each other due to their differing languages. The Neanderthal characters are filled with a sense of foreboding.

The two story lines merge when Edith Fellowes makes the irrevocable decision to go back to the past with Timmie. Her appearance coincides with the crisis point in the confrontation between Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon; both groups regard her as a goddess to be worshiped. As she is clearly akin to the Cro-Magnon but has adopted a Neanderthal child, her appearance deflects the two groups from a would-be inevitable conflict.

The ending suggests that in the modified past Neanderthals and Cro-Magnon would cooperate and come closer to each other in the common worship of the &quot;Goddess&quot; - with Timmie growing up to be her acolyte and a &quot;demigod&quot; himself. It also suggests that the Neanderthals may not become extinct but could coexist with the Cro-Magnon, possibly interbreeding with them, which would change the whole of subsequent human history (or, according to a different theory of the implications of time travel, could have no effect at all due to the &quot;convergent series&quot;).

==Critical view==
Margaret Woods wrote about the novel: &quot;Well, &#x27;Ugly Little Boy&#x27; draws you right in and does not let go. An enthralling plot, credible characters which make you feel great empathy - all of which serves to hide a very fundamental flaw: the basic premise of the plot just does not make any sense. What the hell is the use of spending a lot of money and effort in order to bring a Neanderthal child into the here-and-now - and then proceeding to give him an English name, teach him English, and place him in a modern environment with modern toys to play with? How is that supposed to help you learn about the Neanderthals?&quot;

==Original ending==

In the first draft of the story, the story had ended very differently. Timmie was not returned to his own time, and it transpired that, due to his abduction, he was no longer the inventor of the technique for artificially creating fire, as he would have been. The course of history was therefore set back by 2,500 years, wiping out modern civilization - a clear &quot;Butterfly effect&quot;. This assumes, however, that a child snatched at complete random from prehistoric times would turn out to be exactly the unique inventor of making fire, and also that with him absent no one else would have invented it - both quite unlikely. 

&quot;Galaxy&quot; editor Horace Gold insisted that Asimov change the ending. Asimov agreed, and once he had written the new ending the story became one of Asimov&#x27;s own favourites.

<text>Heald Green and Long Lane Ratepayers Association is a Ratepayers&#x27; Association in the Heald Green ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.

In every local election since its creation in 1927, independents sponsored by the association have held the council seats in the ward. The association has also supplied three mayors and two deputy mayors since the ward became a part of Stockport in 1974.

The association states that it does not have a manifesto or party policies, instead sponsoring councillors who live in the area to represent the community.

==History==
The association was formed in 1927 following the creation of the Heald Green electoral ward.

In 1962, the ratepayers&#x27; launched a community magazine named &quot;CONTACT&quot;.

The ratepayers&#x27; association would become entangled with the construction and development of runways at Manchester Airport several times through its history. As far back as April 1960, the association joined forces with the Hale Barns and Handforth ratepayer associations to spearhead opposition against the development of the new runways, due to noise pollution concerns. During a meeting of the Manchester Airport Consultative Committee, founded by the airport in 1969, the chair stated &quot;we are watching the airport consultative committee like hawks and we shall not hesitate to give it a kick in the right place.&quot; In 1997, the group began campaigning alongside local groups such as the Manchester Airport Joint Action Group and the Stockport Campaign Against Runway Extension against the construction of Runway 2. Councillor Peter Burns made a statement on the runway in 2005, nearly four years following its construction amid local complaints: &quot;I feel that Manchester Airport has already broken an undertaking given to residents under the flight path of this runway - and it had only been open for 102 hours.&quot; A spokesperson for Manchester Airport stated that due to debris, planes were forced to land on the second runway from the Stockport direction.

<doc id="512681" wikidata="Q960361" url="?curid=512681" title="RPL (programming language)">
<text>RPL is a handheld calculator operating system and application programming language used on Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s scientific graphing RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculators of the HP 28, 48, 49 and 50 series, but it is also usable on non-RPN calculators, such as the 38, 39 and 40 series. Internally, it was also utilized by the 17B, 18C, 19B and 27S.

RPL is a structured programming language based on RPN, but equally capable of processing algebraic expressions and formulae, implemented as a threaded interpreter. RPL has many similarities to Forth, both languages being stack-based, as well as the list-based LISP. Contrary to previous HP RPN calculators, which had a fixed four-level stack, the dynamic stack used by RPL is only limited by available RAM, with the calculator displaying an error message when running out of memory rather than silently dropping arguments off the stack as in fixed-sized RPN stacks.

RPL originated from HP&#x27;s Corvallis, Oregon development facility in 1984 as a replacement for the previous practice of implementing the operating systems of calculators in assembly language. The first calculator utilizing it internally was the HP-18C and the first calculator making it available to users was the HP-28C, both from 1986. The last pocket calculator supporting RPL, the HP 50g, was discontinued in 2015. However, multiple emulators that can emulate HP&#x27;s RPL calculators exist that run on a range of operating systems, and devices, including iOS and Android smartphones. There are also a number of community projects to recreate and extend RPL on newer calculators, like newRPL or DB48X, which may add features or improve performance.

==Variants==
The internal low- to medium-level variant of RPL, called System RPL (or SysRPL) is used on some earlier HP calculators as well as the aforementioned ones, as part of their operating system implementation language. In the HP 48 series this variant of RPL is not accessible to the calculator user without the use of external tools, but in the HP 49/50 series there is a compiler built into ROM to use SysRPL. It is possible to cause a serious crash while coding in SysRPL, so caution must be used while using it. The high-level User RPL (or UserRPL) version of the language is available on said graphing calculators for developing textual as well as graphical application programs. All UserRPL programs are internally represented as SysRPL programs, but use only a safe subset of the available SysRPL commands. The error checking that is a part of UserRPL commands, however, makes UserRPL programs noticeably slower than equivalent SysRPL programs. The UserRPL command SYSEVAL tells the calculator to process designated parts of a UserRPL program as SysRPL code.

==Control blocks==
RPL control blocks are not strictly postfix. Although there are some notable exceptions, the control block structures appear as they would in a standard infix language. The calculator manages this by allowing the implementation of these blocks to skip ahead in the program stream as necessary.

===Conditional statements===

====IF/THEN/ELSE/END====
RPL supports basic conditional testing through the IF/THEN/ELSE structure. The basic syntax of this block is:

 IF condition THEN if-true [ELSE if-false] END

The following example tests to see if the number at the bottom of the stack is &quot;1&quot; and, if so, replaces it with &quot;Equal to one&quot;:

 « IF 1 == THEN &quot;Equal to one&quot; END »

The IF construct evaluates the condition then tests the bottom of the stack for the result. As a result, RPL can optionally support FORTH-style IF blocks, allowing the condition to be determined before the block. By leaving the condition empty, the IF statement will not make any changes to the stack during the condition execution and will use the existing result at the bottom of the stack for the test:

 « 1 == IF THEN &quot;Equal to one&quot; END »

====IFT/IFTE====
Postfix conditional testing may be accomplished by using the IFT (&quot;if-then&quot;) and IFTE (&quot;if-then-else&quot;) functions.

IFT and IFTE pop two or three commands off the stack, respectively. The topmost value is evaluated as a Boolean and, if true, the second topmost value is pushed back on the stack. IFTE allows a third &quot;else&quot; value that will be pushed back on the stack if the Boolean is false.

The following example uses the IFT function to pop an object from the bottom of the stack and, if it is equal to 1, replaces it with &quot;One&quot;:

 « 1 == &quot;One&quot; IFT »

The following example uses the IFTE function to pop an object from the bottom of the stack and, if it is equal to 1, replaces it with &quot;One&quot;. If it does not equal 1, it replaces it with the string &quot;Not one&quot;:

 « 1 == &quot;One&quot; &quot;Not one&quot; IFTE »

IFT and IFTE will evaluate a program block given as one of its arguments, allowing a more compact form of conditional logic than an IF/THEN/ELSE/END structure. The following example pops an object from the bottom of the stack, and replaces it with &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Less&quot;, or &quot;More&quot;, depending on whether it is equal to, less than, or greater than 1.
 DUP 1 ==
 « DROP &quot;One&quot; »
 « 1 &lt; &quot;Less&quot; &quot;More&quot; IFTE »
 IFTE

====CASE/THEN/END====
To support more complex conditional logic, RPL provides the CASE/THEN/END structure for handling multiple exclusive tests. Only one of the branches within the CASE statement will be executed. The basic syntax of this block is:

 CASE 
 condition_1 THEN if-condition_1 END 
 condition_n THEN if-condition_n END
 if-none
 END

The following code illustrates the use of a CASE/THEN/END block. Given a letter at the bottom of the stack, it replaces it with its string equivalent or &quot;Unknown letter&quot;:
 CASE 
 DUP &quot;A&quot; == THEN &quot;Alpha&quot; END
 DUP &quot;B&quot; == THEN &quot;Beta&quot; END
 DUP &quot;G&quot; == THEN &quot;Gamma&quot; END
 &quot;Unknown letter&quot;
 END
 SWAP DROP @ Get rid of the original letter

This code is identical to the following nested IF/THEN/ELSE/END block equivalent:
 IF DUP &quot;A&quot; ==
 THEN
 &quot;Alpha&quot;
 ELSE 
 IF DUP &quot;B&quot; == THEN
 &quot;Beta&quot;
 ELSE 
 IF DUP &quot;G&quot; == THEN
 &quot;Gamma&quot;
 ELSE
 &quot;Unknown letter&quot;
 END
 END 
 END
 SWAP DROP @ Get rid of the original letter

===Looping statements===

====FOR/NEXT====
RPL provides a FOR/NEXT statement for looping from one index to another. The index for the loop is stored in a temporary local variable that can be accessed in the loop. The syntax of the FOR/NEXT block is:

 index_from index_to FOR variable_name loop_statement NEXT

The following example uses the FOR loop to sum the numbers from 1 to 10. The index variable of the FOR loop is &quot;I&quot;:
 0 @ Start with zero on the stack
 1 10 @ Loop from 1 to 10
 FOR I @ &quot;I&quot; is the local variable
 I + @ Add &quot;I&quot; to the running total
 NEXT @ Repeat...

====START/NEXT====
The START/NEXT block is used for a simple block that runs from a start index to an end index. Unlike the FOR/NEXT loop, the looping variable is not available. The syntax of the START/NEXT block is:

 index_from index_to START loop_statement NEXT

====FOR/STEP and START/STEP====
Both FOR/NEXT and START/NEXT support a user-defined step increment. By replacing the terminating NEXT keyword with an increment and the STEP keyword, the loop variable will be incremented or decremented by a different value than the default of +1. For instance, the following loop steps back from 10 to 2 by decrementing the loop index by 2:

 « 10 2 START -2 STEP »

====WHILE/REPEAT/END====
The WHILE/REPEAT/END block in RPL supports an indefinite loop with the condition test at the start of the loop. The syntax of the WHILE/REPEAT/END block is:

 WHILE condition REPEAT loop_statement END

====DO/UNTIL/END====
The DO/UNTIL/END block in RPL supports an indefinite loop with the condition test at the end of the loop. The syntax of the DO/UNTIL/END block is:

 DO loop_statement UNTIL condition END

== Notes ==
:1. &quot;RPL&quot; is derived from Reverse Polish Lisp according to its original developers, while for a short time in 1987 HP marketing attempted to coin the backronym ROM-based Procedural Language for it. In addition, the RPL initials are sometimes incorrectly interpreted as Reverse Polish Logic or Reverse Polish Language.

<doc id="512684" wikidata="Q4926739" url="?curid=512684" title="Blink (band)">
<text>Blink are a pop rock band from Ireland. Noted for their melancholy humour, they have released four albums since their inception in the early 1990s. 

Their 1994 debut album, &quot;A Map of the Universe by Blink&quot;, was a Top Ten in the Irish album charts and their second album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;The End is High&quot;, was a &quot;Billboard&quot; album of the week upon release. 

Their 2004 album &quot;Deep Inside the Sound of Sadness&quot;, was nominated for Irish Album of the Year at the 2005 Meteor Music Awards, losing out to Snow Patrol for their album &quot;Final Straw&quot;.

The band are also notable for being the first band pictured on a telephone card. A run of 202,000 were produced in 1993. This included a smaller limited run of 2000 cards, which were used as membership cards for the band&#x27;s fan club. All the cards read &#x27;Limited Edition&#x27; despite being produced in great quantities.

The band&#x27;s name comes from the song &quot;Iceblink Luck&quot; by the Cocteau Twins, a favourite song of drummer Barry Campbell.

San Diego–based pop punk band Blink-182 originally also performed under the name Blink, even releasing several demos and their debut studio album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, under this name, but the threat of a legal dispute with the Irish band resulted in their name change to Blink-182. After the name change, Blink-182 re-released &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; under their current moniker.

==Biography==
Blink was formed in the early 1990s by vocalist and guitarist Dermot Lambert, keyboardist Robbie Sexton, bassist Brian McLoughlin and drummer Barry Campbell. The band&#x27;s inclusion on a CD that circulated at a trade festival in New York generated positive reviews, which led to the band signing with British label EMI for their debut release.

Four months after playing their debut gig in 1992, Blink found themselves in a recording studio working with producers John O&#x27;Neill, Gil Norton and Steve Hillage on material that would make up their first record, &quot;A Map of the Universe by Blink&quot;, released in August 1994. The first two singles from the album, &quot;Going to Nepal&quot; and &quot;Happy Day&quot;, reached the Top 20 in the Irish charts, with the third and final single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not My Fault&quot;, debuting at No. 8. Following the record&#x27;s release, Parlophone and EMI launched the imprint Lime Records in the US, allowing them to take Blink stateside, where they garnered college and mainstream radio airplay and played live shows.

After spending some time playing shows and promoting the band in the US they began receiving requests from Parlophone to return to the studio and begin work on a second album, so they returned to the UK to start writing and recording. The delay in production of new material resulted in the band receiving a letter in April 1996, informing them that the label had decided to terminate the contract.

Offers of shows and support slots with bands they had met in the US had left the band feeling reluctant to return to the UK to produce a new record. The termination of their contract with Parlophone allowed them to return to America and in 1997 the band signed with the now defunct Paradigm Records. Blink began recording their second album, &quot;The End Is High&quot;, releasing it in the US in March 1998. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named the album their album of the week upon its release. It went on to sell 90,000 copies and the band began receiving offers for support slots on larger tours. Between 1999 and 2004 Blink opened shows for Mercury Rev, Moby, Lloyd Cole, The Cardigans, Mark Geary and Blink-182.

Despite Paradigm Records closing its doors, Blink and producer Howie Beno decided to proceed with plans for a third album, which would eventually become 2004&#x27;s &quot;Deep Inside the Sound of Sadness&quot;. American singer-songwriter and producer Wendy Starland contributed vocals to the track &quot;Don&#x27;t You Rollerblade in Nashville Tennessee?&quot;

In June 2013, lead singer and guitarist Dermot Lambert released his debut solo album, &quot;Tiny&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Satellite&quot;, &quot;Hey Sean&quot; and &quot;Fade Into the Morning Sun&quot;.

In December 2015 the band&#x27;s manager, Aiden Lambert, passed away after a battle with cancer. Lambert was a former staff member at the Irish magazines &quot;Hot Press&quot; and &quot;The Phoenix&quot; before managing Blink. There was a large turnout for his funeral, which included tributes from many of his former colleagues in the Irish music and media industries.

<doc id="512686" wikidata="Q384261" url="?curid=512686" title="Forward Wales">
<text>Forward Wales () was a socialist political party operating in Wales. It evolved from the John Marek Independent Party (JMIP), formed by the ex-Labour member of the Welsh Assembly, John Marek who was the party&#x27;s national convenor.

On 8 November 2003, the JMIP decided to rename itself Forward Wales. The party sought to advance socialist policies for Wales as an alternative to what it perceived as a Labour Party which had moved away from socialism.

Forward Wales had recruited various existing politicians disillusioned with their current parties such as:
*Ron Davies, a former Secretary of State for Wales under the Labour Party;
*Graeme Beard, a former Plaid Cymru councillor in Caerphilly;
*Klaus Armstrong-Braun, a former Green Party councillor on Flintshire County Council.

==Principles==
The party listed its principles as being:

For a democratic socialist Wales:

#All people of Wales regardless of ethnic origin, creed, gender or sexual orientation are equal citizens and Forward Wales will represent all without favour or discrimination and based on these founding principles.
#Wales should enjoy parity with Scotland within the current constitutional arrangements in the UK and should enjoy no fewer powers than any other of the UK nations or regions should any further devolution arrangements be enacted.
#The UK is a rich state but has unacceptable variations in wealth and opportunity between its peoples and regions. We seek to reduce those variations and wish to secure for Wales levels of public spending that accurately reflect the relative levels of economic prosperity and social provision between Wales and other parts of the UK.
#We are committed to open and pluralist politics and will co operate with other political parties in Wales, the UK and Europe where common causes exist.
#We will support and take part in international movements designed to secure peace, freedom, international co-operation for sustainable world development and social justice.
#Recognising the quality of modern economic and social life depends on public services, we are committed to the maintenance of such services within the public realm.
#Understanding that healthy politics requires robust debate, party members shall at all times be respectful, tolerant and considerate to others.
#We defend the civil rights of all language communities. Understanding the value, importance, but threatened status, of the Welsh language, we support special measures throughout Wales and especially in vulnerable core areas to nurture the language and build sustainable communities on which it ultimately depends.
#As a democratic party we encourage local participation, with the aim of creating self-reliant and sustainable communities equipped to take maximum decisions on their own behalf as the basis for a socialist society.
#Sustainability is the most fundamental of all principles. We do not believe anyone has the right to act in a way which diminishes the life chances of future generations and so the long-term consequences shall guide our policies in all that we seek to do.
The party was strongly pro-devolution but opposed notions of Welsh independence. 

==History and results==
At the European election in 2004, they polled 17,280 votes, 1.9% of the Welsh total. In the 2007 National Assembly for Wales election, Marek and Davies, while both remaining part of the Forward Wales leadership, stood as independents, but neither was elected and no-one stood as a Forward Wales candidate leaving the party without representation in the National Assembly. Abortive talks were also held with Blaenau Gwent People&#x27;s Voice Group.

Forward Wales contested the 2004 Wrexham County Borough Council election in which they won one seat, closely missing out on a second, and received 11.7% of the votes in the election. David Bithell was elected for the Johnstown ward for Forward Wales, but would later become an independent who is still elected to Wrexham County Borough Council as of the 2022 Wrexham County Borough Council election.

Alwyn Humphreys unsuccessfully contested Clwyd South for Forward Wales in the 2005 UK General Election where he received 2.4% of the vote share.

It was announced in January 2010 that Forward Wales would not renew its registration with the electoral commission and the party was disbanded. Marek subsequently joined the Conservative Party in March 2010. Ron Davies unsuccessfully stood as the Plaid Cymru candidate in Caerphilly during the 2011 Welsh Assembly elections.

<doc id="512698" wikidata="Q295506" url="?curid=512698" title="Nicky Butt">
<text>Nicholas Butt (born 21 January 1975) is an English football coach and former player who was most recently the head of first-team development at Manchester United. He is also a co-owner and chief executive officer of Salford City. Butt played professional football as a midfielder from 1992 to 2011. He spent the majority of his career with Manchester United, where he won six Premier League titles, three FA Cups, four FA Community Shields, the UEFA Champions League and the Intercontinental Cup. 

Butt moved to Newcastle United in 2004. He spent one season on loan to Birmingham City in 2005–06. He finished his career abroad, playing for South China where he won the Hong Kong League Cup.

Butt earned 39 caps for England between 1997 and 2004. He was chosen for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2004.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===

Born in Gorton, Manchester, Butt began his career at Manchester United as an important part of their youth team before turning professional in 1993.

He made his first-team debut in the 1992–93 season as a substitute against Oldham Athletic in a 3–0 Premier League win on 21 November 1992, but did not get his big break in the team until the 1994–95 season, often covering for Roy Keane in the event of injuries and suspension. One of his first appearances for the first team came in the FA Cup semi-final on 10 April 1994, also against Oldham as a substitute, this time in a 1–1 draw at Wembley Stadium. United won the replay 4–1 at Maine Road but he was not included in the squad. 1994–95 saw Butt play 35 games in all competitions, scoring one goal and featuring in the starting eleven for the FA Cup final, which United lost to Everton.

With the departure of Paul Ince to Internazionale in the 1995 close season, manager Alex Ferguson chose to draft in Butt as Ince&#x27;s successor in midfield alongside Roy Keane. Butt was part of a notable batch of talented, young Manchester United players dubbed Fergie&#x27;s Fledglings, who had mostly been involved in United&#x27;s FA Youth Cup-winning triumph of 1992 and gradually been introduced into the first team over the next few seasons. Others included David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Paul Scholes – who all spent a decade or more in the Old Trafford team&#x27;s first team and helped the club win numerous major trophies as the dominant force in English football.

Butt performed remarkably in his early seasons as a regular first team player at United, and often started in the lineup, scoring crucial goals, such as against Liverpool in Eric Cantona&#x27;s comeback match in October 1995, and forcing Nigel Winterburn to concede an own goal for the winner against Arsenal in November 1996 – a game which saw the end of a three-match losing run in the league. Butt also functioned as a steady replacement for Roy Keane as the midfield ball winner, while Keane was injured for much of the 1997–98 season, earning a PFA Team of the Year award that year. However, Keane returned and after forward Paul Scholes was re-deployed as a midfielder around the end of the 1990s. Butt&#x27;s first-team chances started to become increasingly limited, with many of his appearances coming from the bench from this stage onwards.

Butt still went on to collect many honours at United, as the club capped their domination of the 1990s with a remarkable and unique treble win in 1999 (with Butt playing the whole of the Champions League Final due to Roy Keane being suspended), and several more titles in the years up till 2001. By the time of his departure from Old Trafford, Butt had gained six Premier League title winner&#x27;s medals, three FA Cup winner&#x27;s medals and a Champions League winner&#x27;s medal. He had also collected an FA Cup runners-up medal in 1995.

===Newcastle United===
Butt handed in a transfer request in January 2004, but turned down a proposed move to Birmingham City during the January transfer window. He was signed by Bobby Robson for Newcastle United in July 2004 for a fee of £2.5 million on a four-year deal, where he was seen as a replacement for the veteran Gary Speed, who had moved to Bolton Wanderers.

Butt had a disappointing and injury-marred 2004–05 season, prompting the then Newcastle manager Graeme Souness to sign Senegalese midfielder Amdy Faye in January 2005. Despite a promising start, the fans turned on Butt after the 4–1 defeat against Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final. The acquisition of Scott Parker and Emre in the summer of 2005 pushed Butt further down the pecking order, and his move to Birmingham City (managed by former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce) on a season-long loan was announced on 3 August 2005.

However, on 13 February 2006, Butt walked out on his manager and former Manchester United teammate Steve Bruce, after finding out Bruce placed his son Alex Bruce in the squad ahead of him, and was later fined two weeks wages. After Birmingham were relegated from the Premier League, Butt returned to Newcastle who were being managed by Glenn Roeder.

Although not an instant fan favourite at St. James&#x27; Park, Butt won over some fans with two goals scored through headers in a pre-season friendly against Villarreal. There was some speculation that newly appointed Sunderland manager Roy Keane would try to sign his former Manchester United midfield partner. However, due to the lack of back-up midfielders at Newcastle and his good pre-season form, Butt remained at Newcastle.
During the 2006–07 season, Butt was much more involved in the first team at Newcastle, playing in the holding role which allowed the likes of Parker and Emre to go forward. On 14 January 2007, Butt scored his first Newcastle goal in over 2 years when he scored the winner against Tottenham Hotspur in a 3–2 victory at White Hart Lane. Butt&#x27;s return to form was encapsulated when he captained Newcastle in a UEFA Cup match against Zulte Waregem on 15 February when Parker was injured. His good form that season continued, as on 9 April, Butt won the man of the match award for his performance against Arsenal. He continued to captain Newcastle whenever Parker was injured, and by the end of the season it was widely considered that he had won over the Newcastle fans.

With Parker having moved to West Ham United, Butt continued to play a big part in Newcastle&#x27;s 2007–08 campaign. On 21 December, he penned a new contract keeping him at the club until the end of next season. After being an almost ever-present in that season, he expressed a desire to finish his career with Newcastle. Butt also started the season as captain, filling in for the injured Michael Owen, and proved to be a popular choice. Butt played his 100th league game for Newcastle on 21 December 2008, marking it with a 2–1 home win against Tottenham. Newcastle were eventually relegated that season, meaning that Butt&#x27;s record of playing in every Premier League season has been relinquished.

Butt was made permanent club captain for the 2009–10 season, his first outside the top flight, following Michael Owen&#x27;s departure to Manchester United as a free agent during the summer transfer window. However, vice-captain Alan Smith&#x27;s impressive form saw him take the armband more often than Butt. Butt started fewer games, but still effectively carried out his holding role well, leading his side to gritty shutouts in most of the games he started.

The club eventually won both promotion to the Premier League and the Championship title, and Butt announced his retirement in the build-up to Newcastle&#x27;s last home game against Ipswich Town. He entered his penultimate game as a substitute and won a penalty en route to a 2–2 draw. Butt lifted the Championship trophy alongside vice-captain Alan Smith.

After leaving Newcastle he was backed by former Newcastle boss Chris Hughton to move into coaching, although a coaching position with Newcastle is not something Hughton had spoken with Butt about.

===South China===

On 6 November 2010, the chairman of Hong Kong club South China, Steven Lo, said that the club expected Butt to sign for them at the end of the month. Butt signed for South China on 22 November. Wearing the No. 8 shirt, his first match was against TSW Pegasus in a 2–1 win for South China. Butt scored from a freekick during this game but also missed a penalty.

After leaving South China, he featured in Gary Neville&#x27;s testimonial against Juventus on 24 May 2011 in central midfield alongside Paul Scholes, rekindling the old times in a midfield that also contained David Beckham. However, they lost the game to the Old Lady. Butt also featured in midfield for Eric Cantona&#x27;s New York Cosmos in Scholes&#x27; testimonial match against Manchester United at Old Trafford on 5 August 2011.

==International career==
Having been capped five times at under-21 level, he won his first England cap during the 1996–97 season against Mexico and became a squad regular, providing reliable backup for the central midfield positions. An injury to first choice midfielder Steven Gerrard before the 2002 FIFA World Cup gave Butt his chance in the starting line-up alongside Manchester United teammates David Beckham and Paul Scholes. Ahead of England&#x27;s quarter-final game against Brazil, he was named &quot;the best player of the England squad&quot; by Brazilian legend Pelé, a compliment to his performance in the unattractive holding role. England eventually exited the World Cup after a 2–1 defeat to Brazil.

After the World Cup he returned to his role as a squad player, providing experienced cover for the first-choice midfield pairing of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. He was selected for UEFA Euro 2004, but missed the tournament through injury. His last international appearance was in a friendly against Spain on 17 November 2004. In total he appeared 39 times for England.

==Post-playing career==
===Coaching===
In October 2012, Butt returned to Manchester United as a coach for the club&#x27;s reserve team. He was appointed head of the academy in February 2016, a few months after the departure of Brian McClair. Since November 2016, he has filled in as interim coach of the reserve (under-23) team after Warren Joyce left for the managerial position at Wigan Athletic. He briefly served as assistant to Ryan Giggs, after Giggs was made the interim manager of the Manchester United first team, following the departure of David Moyes.

In July 2019, Manchester United restructured their backroom staff, making Butt the head of first-team development, reporting directly to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær to help improve the transition for young players from the youth team to the first team. Nick Cox replaced Butt as head of the academy. In March 2021, it was announced that Butt was to leave Manchester United after 9 years there in various coaching roles within their academy.

===Business interests===
In 2014, it was announced that Butt, along with fellow ex-Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Gary and Phil Neville had agreed a deal to purchase Salford City ahead of the 2014–15 season. with plans to get the club to the Football League. The group announced they would take part in a special friendly, with Salford facing a Class of &#x27;92 team. On 22 September, the group agreed to sell a 50% stake in the club to billionaire Peter Lim.

On 31 October 2022, Salford City announced the appointment of Butt as the club&#x27;s chief executive officer, taking over from Gary Neville who had served in that role in a part-time capacity for eight years. On 15 October 2024, Butt announced he was stepping down as CEO of Salford to pursue coaching opportunities.

==Personal life==
Butt was arrested and bailed for assaulting a woman in 2004. Butt married his long-time girlfriend Shelley Barlow in 2008. They have two children. Butt was arrested for alleged domestic assault in April 2019 but the case was discontinued after the Crown Prosecution Service offered no evidence. Butt accepted a caution for criminal damage.

In 2024, Butt was banned from driving for a year and ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work for breaking a motorcyclist&#x27;s leg during an accident caused by Butt&#x27;s &quot;lapse of concentration&quot;.

<text>The Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium (CBB) is an athletic conference and academic consortium between three private liberal arts colleges in the U.S. State of Maine. The group consists of Colby College in Waterville, Bates College in Lewiston, and Bowdoin College in Brunswick. In allusion to the Big Three of the Ivy League, Colby, Bates, and Bowdoin are collectively known the &quot;Maine Big Three&quot;, a play on words with the words &quot;Maine&quot; and &quot;main&quot;. The school names are ordered by their geographical organization in Maine (north to south).

The colleges contest the C-B-B Trophy in three-way football games in the Fall of their respective academic years. As of the 2023–24 season, Bowdoin leads the conference in wins, with 20; Colby has 17 and Bates has won 13. Colby holds the record for the longest streak of consecutive wins (1988–1992). Bates holds the record for biggest shutout with a 51–0 game over Colby in 1985. There have been eight three-way-ties: 1965, 1979, 1993, 1995, 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2022. The three colleges also contest the Chase Regatta, an annual up-and-down river tourney. The inaugural winner was Bowdoin, but the series has since been dominated by Bates and Colby; Colby has won the regatta five times and the President&#x27;s Cup nine times. Bates currently holds the most titles (14 out of 20 wins), the winning streak (2006–present), and the most President&#x27;s Cups (9 cups).

The CBB Consortium often draws comparisons to the football games of the Big Three of the Ivy League, with Bowdoin often drawing the connection to Harvard, Bates to Princeton, and Colby to Yale. Just as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are initialized as HYP, so too are Colby, Bates, and Bowdoin as &quot;CBB&quot;.

== History ==
From its inception, Bates College served as an alternative to a more traditional and historically conservative Bowdoin College. There is a long tradition of rivalry and competitiveness between the two colleges, revolving around socioeconomic class, academic quality, and collegiate athletics. The two colleges have competed against each other athletically since the 1870s, and subsequently share one of the ten oldest NCAA Division III football rivalries, in the United States.

The Bates-Bowdoin Game is the most attended football game every academic year at both colleges. As of 2015, both college&#x27;s presidents are named Clayton (Spencer and Rose), leading students to include them in chants against each other. Bowdoin developed a &quot;football fight song&quot; entitled, &quot;Forward the White&quot; in 1913. All football games between the two occurred on Bowdoin&#x27;s Whittier Field, but with the development of Bates&#x27; Garcelon Field, both fields have been used to hold football games.

Colby remained isolated from neighboring Bates, and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium because of its location in Waterville, and socio-economic and political differences. However, in the 1940s, Colby began competing with the two colleges and in the first game, had a three-way tie. In 1988, Bates president Reynolds began the Chase Regatta, which features the President&#x27;s Cup, which is contested by Bates, Colby, and Bowdoin annually.

The CBB Games is a college football competition between the three colleges. Each team plays the others once, with the C-B-B Trophy awarded to the college that beats the other two. The CBB Games was created for the 1965 college football season. Previously, Bates and Bowdoin have competed since 1870s against the University of Maine in the Maine State Series or Maine State Championship. When the University of Maine moved to a higher division in 1965, Colby joined and the rivalry took its current name.

The Chase Regatta is an annual rowing race between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s heavyweight varsity and club rowing crews of the colleges. The colleges have competed in the regatta since August 3, 1988 but have competed annually since August 3, 1997, when Bates President Thomas Hedley Reynolds instated the President&#x27;s Cup to be contested by all three of the CBB schools. The President&#x27;s Cup is given to the team that has won the most overall heats and races, while the overall winner is determined by who won the most varsity and heavyweight competitions in the regatta.

In 1999, all three colleges were prominently featured in &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; In the episode entitled, &quot;College&quot;, Tony Soprano takes his daughter, Meadow on a trip to Maine to tour the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. They first visit Bates in Lewiston; while walking past the college&#x27;s chapel she states, &quot;[Bates has] a 48-to-52 male-female ratio, which is great, strong liberal arts program and this cool Olin Arts Center for music.&quot; They then drive up to Colby and Bowdoin using Drew University in New Jersey as the two college&#x27;s exteriors. On the drive from Bates to Colby, Tony Soprano reveals to his daughter that he is in the mafia, a major turning point in the series.

<text>The Selenga or Selenge ( ; ; , ) is a major river in Mongolia and Buryatia, Russia. Originating from its headwater tributaries, the Ider and the Delger mörön, it flows for before draining into Lake Baikal. The Selenga therefore makes up the most distant headwaters of the Yenisey-Angara river system.

Carrying of water into Lake Baikal, it makes up almost half of the riverine inflow into the lake, and forms a wide delta of when it reaches the lake.

Periodic annual floods are a feature of the Selenga River. The floods can be classified as “ordinary”, “large” or “catastrophic” based on the degree of impact. Of the twenty-six documented floods that occurred between 1730 and 1900, three were “catastrophic”. The three “catastrophic” floods were the floods of 1830, 1869 and 1897.

The Selenga River basin is a semi-arid region that is in area. It is part of the Arctic Ocean Basin and is located in northern Mongolia. Stone implement artifacts found on the Selenga River at the end of the 19th century have been used to form a link between Native Americans and their ancestors in East Asia. The climate of the Selenga basin is influenced by a powerful Siberian anti-cyclone. The weather consists of harsh winters and warm summers, with the river freezing from November to April.

The Selenga River delta is a Ramsar site, surrounded by marshlands. Found in the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia, the wetlands are the habitat of a large number of threatened and endemic species, including the Siberian Baikal sturgeon and over 170 species of birds. The Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe includes the areas of the Orkhon and Selenge river basins. The region has scattered forests and extensive mountain ranges.

River modifications like the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station have affected the environment of the Selenga Delta, causing it to become waterlogged. Activities including mining, agriculture, breeding and dumping of wastewater have also affected the environment of the river. There has been an observed degradation of water quality from these anthropogenic factors. Natural factors like erosion processes and weathering have also contributed to the decline in water quality.

The proposed Shuren Hydropower Plant Project was protested against by environmental groups because of the potential ecological ramifications it would have on the Selenga Delta. The reasons cited included potential disruption to the flow of the river and the breeding grounds of endemic fish species in Lake Baikal.

== Name ==
The name Selenge comes from Mongolian &quot;seleh&quot;, which means &quot;to swim&quot;. &#x27;Selenga&#x27; is the russified version of the same.

An alternate source believes the name originated with the Evenki word &quot;sele&quot; (&quot;iron&quot;) to which the possessive &quot;nge&quot; suffix was added.

The Selenge Province of Mongolia is named after the river.
== History ==

=== Archaeology ===
At the end of the 19th century, evidence of Paleolithic culture was discovered in the Selenga River basin. The artifacts found were collections of stone implements.

During 1928 and 1929, G. P. Sosnovskii, under the purview of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., directed an archaeological Stone Age study in the Selenga Valley near Kiakhta. In this expedition, Sosnovokii discovered remains of local Paleolithic culture in an area that stretched from &quot;the valley of the Selenga River from the Mongolian Frontier down to Selenginsk.&quot;

The &quot;Buriat-Mongol Archaeological Expedition from the Institute for the History of Material Culture, Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R and the Institute of Culture of the Buriat-Mongol A.S.S.R&quot;, undertook a Paleolithic study in the Trans-Baikal region from 1947 to 1958. Directed by A. P. Okladnikov, the study uncovered 30 new sites, including one that covered the area from Selenginsk to the Selenga River mouth, which provided evidence of a Paleolithic-type culture. Among these 30 sites was one called Ust-Kyakhta-3. While Ust-Kyakhta-3 was discovered in 1947, it was only later excavated in 1976 and 1978, yielding &quot;more than 40,000 stone artifacts [and] abundant faunal remains&quot;. Further archaeological work in 2012 at the site found two human tooth fragments.

In a study published in volume 181 of the journal &quot;Cell&quot;, the link between Native Americans and their ancestors in East Asia was established using one of the tooth fragments found at the Ust-Kyakhta-3 site.

=== Floods ===
Periodic floods are characteristic of the Selenga River, with small flooding events observed annually. There have been four periods of high-flooding: 1902-1908, 1932-1942, 1971-1977 and 1990-1998. The floods of the Selenga River can be classified based on the degree of impact.

&quot;Ordinary&quot; floods are floods accompanied by little damage, with maximum outcomes including river overflowing, floodplain flooding and small structural instability.

&quot;Large&quot; floods are those that cover a substantial section of the river and lead to flooding of territories. The maximum outcomes of &quot;large&quot; floods include flooding of settlements and agricultural land damage.

&quot;Catastrophic&quot; floods refer to floods that cover the majority of the river basin and cause flooding of whole settlements. These floods included the possibility of human casualties, and are estimated to occur 3-4 times per century. Twenty-six floods occurred between 1730 and 1900, and of these 26, three floods were &quot;catastrophic&quot;.

==== Flood of 1830 ====
The flood of 1830 in the Selenga River is the first flood that was recorded in some detail. On August 1, 1830, the Selenga River and its tributaries, the Chikoy, Dzhida, Khilok and Temnik Rivers, burst their banks. The flood plains and the islands in the Selenga River were completely flooded. On August 16, Verkhneudinsk, the city now known as Ulan-Ude, was flooded and the water level in the city reached . The flood destroyed fifty-four buildings in Selenginsk. After the flood, the town was moved to higher ground on the left bank of the Selenga River. There were also heavy losses in agriculture, with the flood making some pastures and hayfields unusable for an extended period after the flood. The river retreated to its banks by September 27.

==== Flood of 1869 ====
Water levels began to rise on July 24, 1869, but slowly decreased from August 5, 1869. The water level began to rise again on August 22, only beginning to decline from September 3. This flood was classified as a &quot;large&quot; flood. In Verkhneudinsk, the water level reached , and in Lake Baikal, the water level rose by more than . The water level in the Angara River also rose and did not return to its pre-flood levels by January 1870.

==== Flood of 1897 ====
The flood of 1897 began on August 11, when water levels started to rise in the middle and lower reaches of the Selenga River and reached its peak on August 14. The water level then proceeded to decrease gradually over ten days. On the first day of the flood, the water level rose by in three hours. The water level in the Selenga River was over near Verkhneundinsk. The flood did not heavily impact settlements on the banks of the Selenga River, but there were reports of bridge and telegraph pole destruction between the towns of Selenginsk and Verkhneundinsk.

==== Impact of flooding ====
The volume of water inflow into Lake Baikal during the 1897 flood is estimated to have been approximately . Based on the observations of increased water level during floods, it has been deduced that flooding from the Selenge River can affect the environment of Lake Baikal. It can also cause an increase in runoff from the Angara River.

== River course ==
The Selenga River is long and is formed from the convergence of the Ider and Delger rivers. It flows from Mongolia and into east-central Russia, acting as the main tributary of Lake Baikal.

The Delger River flows from the Sangilen Mountains, &quot;found on the border between Mongolia and the Russian republic of Tyva&quot;, while the Ider&#x27;s headwaters are located in the Hangyn Mountains in central Mongolia.

Upon the meeting of the Delger and Ider Rivers, the Selenga River moves northeast from Mongolia and joins with the Orkhon River at Suhbaatar. The river then continues north into Russia.

Once in Russia, the river turns eastward towards Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia and then goes northwards to Tataurovo. The Selenga proceeds to move westwards and then &quot;flows through a delta into Lake Baikal.&quot;

=== Climate ===
A powerful Siberian anti-cyclone is the major influence on the climate of the Selenga basin. It is formed in September and October and disappears in April and May. Due to the anti-cyclone, the 448,000-km2 river basin is prone to a climate of harsh winters, which consist of sunny days and low air temperatures, and warm summers. The river experiences &quot;...extended summer floods and short occasional (event-driven) floods in the other seasons.&quot;

The section of the Selenga River from Suhbaatar to its mouth is ice-free from May to October. Travel across the river is possible during this period. From November to April, the river is covered with ice. The ice drift lasts from 3–6 days. From May to September, in spring and early summer, snowmelt enables maximum discharge.

For 80–90 days, starting in mid-June, the basin area experiences the summer season with precipitation totaling .  This is in contrast to autumn and winter, in which rainfall is typically . In mid-September, autumn begins, lasting for about 65 days.

==Tributaries==
The largest tributaries of the Selenga are, from source to mouth:

* Delger mörön (left)
* Khanui (right)
* Egiin Gol (left)
* Orkhon (right)
* Dzhida (left)
* Chikoy (right)
* Khilok (right)
* Uda (right)
== Watershed ==

=== Selenga River basin ===
The Selenga River basin is part of the larger international Arctic Ocean Basin and is located in northern Mongolia. A semi-arid region, the basin is 280,000 km2 and is Mongolia&#x27;s largest basin.  The basin has two main rivers: the Selenga and the Selenga&#x27;s tributary, the Orkhon.  The &quot;major sub-basins are the Egiin, Ider, Orkhon and Tuul river basins&quot; with Lake Baikal occupying 47% of the Selenga River basin. The terrain of the basin is dominated &quot;by forest or grassland and is underlain by permafrost&quot; according to an article published in 2003 by Ma &quot;et al&quot;.

=== Selenga River delta and the delta wetlands ===
Lobate shaped and 40 km wide, the Selenga River delta is surrounded by marshlands. The formation of the delta is dependent on the sediment load carried by the river, with the lake tides having little impact in terms of geographical change. The sediment balance of the delta is dependent on physical processes, and this, in turn, affects the geochemical barrier functions of the area. During the period of the Irkutsk dam construction (1950–56), there was &quot;increased sediment delivery to the delta&quot; according to an article published in 2017 by Chalov &quot;et al&quot;.

The wetlands of the Selenga River delta are classified as a Ramsar site and are found within the administrative region of the Republic of Buryatia. The wetlands support a large number of threatened and endemic species, including over 170 species of bird. The area has mean air temperatures of 14 degrees Celsius in July and -19.4 degrees Celsius in January, with floods often occurring in summer after heavy rains.

=== Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe ===
The Selenge-Orkhon forest steppe is a palearctic ecoregion that is a medium between steppe and taiga. The region includes the Orkhon and Selenge river basins, and features scattered forests as well as extensive mountain ranges. The mean altitude of the landscape is 800-1200m, with flora like &quot;Rosa acicularis&quot; found at lower altitudes. The area has a dry and humid climate that is influenced by warm winds from the northeast steppe regions.

== River modifications ==

=== Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power station ===
The construction of Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power station began in spring of 1950 and was completed on December 29, 1956. Built on the Angara River, the station was designed to raise the water level of the Angara River to match the water level of Lake Baikal. It would then raise the water level of Lake Baikal by 1.5m. The power plant causes water-level fluctuations in Lake Baikal, which in turn causes part of the Selenga Delta to become waterlogged. The delta is drained in response to activities at the power station.

=== Shuren Hydropower Plant Project ===
In 2015, Mongolia was reported to be planning the construction of a dam, named the Shuren Hydropower Plant, on the Selenga River. Environmental groups protested this plan, as they were concerned with the potential ecological ramifications, building a hydroelectric plant on the Selenga River, would have on the ecosystem of Lake Baikal. Disrupting the flow of the river would disturb the breeding grounds of many endemic fish species in Lake Baikal. This would have a on the rare birds and aquatic species that inhabit the area. The Shuren Hydropower Plant Project was proposed in 2013 and was under the review of a World Bank-funded environmental and social impact assessment. On September 27, 2017, the World Bank froze its tender process on the Shuren Hydropower Plant Project.

== Natural history ==

=== Fish ===
&quot;Leocottus kesslerii gussinensis&quot; and &quot;Leocottus kesslerii arachlensis&quot; are endemic subspecies of fish that are found in the Selenga River headwaters and the upper Khilok River. Lake Baikal is the habitat of the Siberian Baikal sturgeon. The Selenga river is a breeding ground for the sturgeon, with migration taking place within the river system. The fish has two migration periods, which occur during the warmer part of the year. The first migration period begins in the second half of April when the water temperature is 3-5 degrees Celsius and finishes in approximately mid-June. The second migration of the Baikal sturgeon is the main migration period. It coincides with the summer floods of the Selenga. When the water temperature begins to cool, this signals the end of the migration. There is also a non-migrating species of sturgeon that inhabits the Selenga catchment.

=== Birds ===
Large populations of migrating, breeding and moulting waterbirds assemble at the wetlands in the Selenga Delta, which has been recognised as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International.

==== Migrating species that occur in the Delta ====

* Siberian crane, &quot;Grus leucogeranus&quot;
* Black stork, &quot;Ciconia nigra&quot;
* Bewick&#x27;s swan, &quot;Cygnus bewicki&quot;
* Swan goose, &quot;Anser cygnoides&quot;
* Imperial eagle, &quot;Aquila heliacal&quot;
* Golden eagle, &quot;A. chrysaetos&quot;
* Peregrine falcon, &quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;
* Gyr falcon, &quot;F. gyrfalco&quot;

== Hydrology ==

=== Water quality of the Selenga River ===
Before the turn of the millennium, the Selenga River and Lake Baikal had rich aquatic ecosystems nearly untouched by human influence. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, the basin, which contains vast plains, has been affected by agricultural, climatic and economic factors. This includes changes like forest losses, urbanization and a growth in farming and mining activities.

Factors that affect the water quality of the Selenga River can be classified as either anthropogenic or natural factors. Anthropogenic factors include mining activities, agriculture, breeding, dumping of wastewater into water bodies and water use. Natural factors include erosion processes and weathering. The escalation of anthropogenic factors can be correlated with pollution by &quot;potentially toxic elements, including metals and persistent organic pollutants.&quot;

Mongolia has had rapid growth in GDP since 1999, fueled by agriculture, mining and light industry. These activities, particularly mining, have threatened the surface water quality of the Selenga River and adjacent groundwater.

A study published in volume 12 of the journal &quot;Water&quot;, found that based on the Mongolian National Standard, &quot;the main pollutants of the Selenga River are Zn ... As ... and Pb ...&quot;  They also found that metal content in the river water was tens or hundreds of times higher in sites closer to urban and mining areas. Based on data observing toxicological and bioaccumulation effects on aquatic biota, the contamination has been shown to have an ecological impact.

=== Uses of the river ===
The Selenga River has an influential role in managing the economic futures of Mongolia and Russia. It is used extensively for activities that include hay harvesting, mining, grazing, commercial and sport fishing.

Many of these uses contribute to the degradation of the river’s water quality, with the main Mongolian sources of pollution, including the Zaamar gold placer, the Shar River gold mining, settlements and agriculture.

There are ten large-scale wastewater treatment plants in the Selenge River basin in Mongolia. These wastewater treatment plants are located in the Mongolian cities of Tsetserleg, Bulgan, Darkhan City, Uliastai, Erdenet City, Arvaikheer, Sukhbaatar, Zuunmod, Murun and Ulaanbaatar.

The city of Ulan-Ude uses the Selenga River as its primary source of water for its municipal water supply, using 60 wells with submersible pumps to withdraw water. The total pumped water in 2009 was .

<text>Major Friedrich Wilhelm Kasiski (29 November 1805 – 22 May 1881) was a German infantry officer, cryptographer and archeologist. Kasiski was born in Schlochau, Kingdom of Prussia (now Człuchów, Poland).

==Military service==
Kasiski enlisted in East Prussia&#x27;s 33rd Infantry Regiment on 20 March 1823 at the age of 17. In May 1824, he was promoted to the rank of master sergeant, and eight months later was commissioned as a second lieutenant in February 1825. It took fourteen years to earn his next promotion when, in May 1839, he advanced to the rank of first lieutenant. His next advancement was quicker, promoted to captain in November 1842. Kasiski finally retired from active service with the rank of major on 17 February 1852.

Between 1860 and 1868 he was the commander of a National Guard battalion.

==Cryptography==

In 1863, Kasiski published a 95-page book on cryptography, &quot;Die Geheimschriften und die Dechiffrir-Kunst&quot; (German, &quot;Secret writing and the Art of Deciphering&quot;). This was the first published account of a procedure for attacking polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, especially the Vigenère cipher (although it is possible Charles Babbage was already aware of a similar method but had not published it). The method relied on the analysis of gaps between repeated fragments in the ciphertext; such analysis can give hints as to the length of the key used. This technique is known as Kasiski examination.

The significance of Kasiski&#x27;s cryptanalytic work was not widely realised at the time, and he turned his mind to archaeology instead. The later years of his life were spent at Neustettin (Szczecinek); the 11th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica cited a scholarly article by Kasiski in its entry on the town. Historian David Kahn notes, &quot;Kasiski died on May 22, 1881, almost certainly without realizing that he had written a revolution in cryptology&quot; (&quot;The Codebreakers&quot;).

<doc id="512725" wikidata="Q917663" url="?curid=512725" title="Assembly of Experts">
<text>The Assembly of Experts (), also translated as the Assembly of Experts of the Leadership or as the Council of Experts, is the deliberative body empowered to appoint the Supreme Leader of Iran. All directly elected members must first be vetted by the Guardian Council.

All candidates to the Assembly of Experts must be approved by the Guardian Council whose members are, in turn, appointed either directly or indirectly by the Supreme Leader. The Assembly consists of 88 Mujtahids that are elected from lists of thoroughly vetted candidates (in 2016 166 candidates were approved by the Guardians out of 801 who applied to run for the office), by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet at least twice every six months.

==1979 Assembly of Experts elections==
As the 3 August 1979 elections for the Assembly of Experts drew near, Ruhollah Khomeini began to signal to Iranians which candidates they should support and which they should avoid. He characterized the opposition as Westernized intellectuals, Marxists, and morally corrupt secular groups who neither believed in Islam or who opposed the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The results of the Assembly of Experts election fulfilled Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s objectives as sixty-eight percent of the elected representatives were clerics, with fifty out of the seventy-three members being part of the clergy.

==Functions==
===In the constitution===
According to Article 111 of the Iranian Constitution, the assembly is in charge of supervising, dismissing and electing the Supreme Leader.

Whenever the Leader becomes incapable of fulfilling his constitutional duties, or loses one of the qualifications mentioned in Articles 5 and 109, or it becomes known that he did not possess some of the qualifications initially, he will be dismissed. The authority of determination in this matter is vested with the experts specified in Article 108. In the event of the death, or resignation or dismissal of the Leader, the experts shall take steps within the shortest possible time for the appointment of the new Leader. ... Whenever the Leader becomes temporarily unable to perform the duties of leadership owing to his illness or any other incident, then during this period, the council mentioned in this Article shall assume his duties.

To choose the Supreme Leader, the Experts review qualified candidates and consult among themselves. According to the Constitution, the criteria of qualification for the office of the Supreme Leader include &quot;Islamic scholarship, justice, piety, right political and social perspicacity, prudence, courage, administrative facilities and adequate capability for leadership.&quot; The jurist deemed as the most well-versed in Islamic regulations, in fiqh, or in political and social issues, most generally popular, or of other special prominence is chosen as Supreme Leader. Otherwise, in the absence of such a candidate, the Experts elect and declare one of their own as Supreme Leader.

Article 107 of the constitution states:
the task of appointing the Leader shall be vested with the experts elected by the people. The experts will review and consult among themselves concerning all the fuqaha&#x27; possessing the qualifications specified in 
Articles 5 and 109. In the event they find one of them better versed in Islamic regulations, the subjects of the fiqh, or in political and social issues, or possessing general popularity or special prominence for any of the qualifications mentioned in Article 109, they shall elect him as the Leader. Otherwise, in the absence of such a superiority, they shall elect and declare one of them as the Leader. The Leader thus elected by the Assembly of Experts shall assume all the powers of the wilayat al-amr and all the responsibilities arising therefrom.

Article 99 of the constitution declares &quot;The Guardian Council has the responsibility of supervising the elections of the Assembly of Experts for Leadership&quot;. It also had the responsibility for setting up the first Assembly. The constitution does not specify requirements for candidacy for the Assembly of Experts, leaving the Assembly itself to put limits on who may run for membership. Article 108 states: 
The law setting out the number and qualifications of the experts [mentioned in the preceding article], the mode of their election, and the code of procedure regulating the sessions during the first term must be drawn up by the fuqaha&#x27; on the first Guardian Council, passed by a majority of votes and then finally approved by the Leader of the Revolution. The power to make any subsequent change or a review of this law, or approval of all the provisions concerning the duties of the experts is vested in themselves. 

The 1989 Iranian constitutional referendum removed the requirement for the leader to be a marja&#x27;. Ali Khamenei was not a marja&#x27; at that time.

===Limits of power===
How much actual power the Assembly has to supervise or oversee the Supreme Leader has been questioned. The assembly has never dismissed or even questioned a sitting Supreme Leader and, as all of its meetings and notes are strictly confidential, it has never been known to challenge or otherwise publicly oversee any of the Supreme Leader&#x27;s decisions. All candidates to the Assembly (as well as the President and the Majlis or Parliament), are selected by the Guardian Council, half of whose members are selected by the Supreme Leader. Also, all directly elected members after the vetting process by the Guardian Council still have to be approved by the Supreme Leader.

Furthermore, there have been instances of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticizing members of the Assembly, resulting in that member&#x27;s arrest and an end to their time on the Assembly—an example being Khamenei&#x27;s denouncing of then-member of the Assembly Ahmad Azari Qomi as a &quot;traitor&quot; after the publishing of an open letter by Qomi criticizing Khamenei, resulting in Qomi&#x27;s arrest and the eventual rejection by the Guardian Council of his candidacy for re-election to the Assembly.

===Other rules===
The assembly gathers every six months. Activities of the assembly include compiling a list of those eligible to become Supreme Leader in the event of the current Supreme Leader&#x27;s death, resignation, or dismissal. This is done by the 107/109 commission. Monitoring the current leader to make sure he continues to meet all the criteria listed in the constitution is done by the 111 commission. Members of the Assembly report to this commission about the issues concerning the current Supreme Leader, and the commission can then order an emergency meeting of the Assembly. If the commission denies this, the members can ask the entire plenary of the Assembly (86 members) for a vote, and if most of the members vote in favor, an emergency meeting will be scheduled to discuss the current Supreme Leader. The meetings, meeting notes, and reports of the Assembly are confidential and not made available to anyone outside the assembly, except for the sitting Supreme Leader.

The assembly has passed laws to require all its members be experts in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), authorizing the Guardian Council to vet candidates for ijtihad proficiency using written and oral examinations. This law was challenged by the reformists, and their 2006 election campaign included changing this law to allow non-clerics into the assembly, and reforming the law that allows Guardian Council to vet candidates. Women (Mujtahidehs) are theoretically eligible to run for the Assembly of Experts and in 1998 nine women submitted their candidacy. The Guardian Council rejected them, arguing that they lacked qualifications in fiqh.

Currently, the average age of the members of the Assembly is over 60, which results in many mid-term elections due to deaths and resignations. The members must be Ayatollahs, that is not the case, however, for Mohsen Esmaeili.

==Recent changes==
4 year elections were abandoned in 2023 in favor of 8 year terms.

==Assemblies==

===First Assembly (1983–1991)===
The first elections for the Assembly of Experts of the Leadership were held in December 1982 and the Assembly first convened in 1983. 76 of the total of 83 members were elected in the first round, the rest in the second. The full list of members and election results is available on the Princeton Iran Data Portal.

As a number of members died, by-elections for replacement candidates were held in April 1988.

The Assembly was chaired throughout the term by Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, who chaired the Assembly also in subsequent terms until 2007.

In 1985, the Assembly chose Ayatollah Montazeri as the successor to Supreme Leader Grand Ayatollah Khomeini. But on Sunday, 26 March 1989 Khomeini dismissed him in a letter: &quot;[...]you are no longer eligible to succeed me as the legitimate leader of the state.&quot; Following the death of Ruhollah Khomeini on 3 June 1989, the Assembly of Experts chose Ali Khamenei to be his successor as Supreme Leader in what proved to be a smooth transition. Initially, a council of three members, &quot;Ali Meshkini, Mousavi Ardabili and Ali Khamenei&quot;, were proposed for Leadership. After rejection of a Leadership Council by the assembly, and lack of votes for Grand Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Golpaygani, Khamenei became the Supreme Leader by two-thirds of the votes.

===Second Assembly (1991–1999)===
The Second Assembly was also chaired by Ayatollah Ali Meshkini. The full list of members and election results is available on the Princeton Iran Data Portal. Sayed Mohammad Fagheh was one of the members from the province Neyriz Fars.

===Third Assembly (1999–2007)===
The 3rd assembly was again chaired by Ayatollah Ali Meshkini, deputied by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and Ayatollah Ebrahim Amini. The scribes were former Minister of Intelligence Ghorbanali Dorri-Najafabadi and Ahmad Khatami. The members according to each province were:

===Fourth Assembly (2007–2016)===

The election for the fourth assembly took place on 15 December 2006 and the Assembly first convened on 19 February 2007. In July 2007, chairman Ayatollah Meshkini died, and Ayatollah Rafsanjani was elected to succeed him. On 8 March 2011, Ayatollah Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani replaced Ayatollah Rafsanjani as chairman. On 4 June 2014, Mahdavi Kani fell into a coma after suffering a heart attack and died on 21 October 2014. He was succeeded by Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi as acting chairman.

The term was intended to last for ten years, rather than the usual eight, due to the &quot;election aggregation&quot; plan of the government put in place to allow the government to run elections simultaneously for the Assembly of Experts and the Parliament, thereby economizing election administration costs.

===Fifth Assembly (2016–2024)===
The election of 88 members of the Fifth Assembly took place on 26 February 2016 alongside of the election for 290 members of the Iranian Majlis (parliament). Those elected will sit for a projected 8-year term. The new assembly was opened on 24 May 2016 and selected Ahmad Jannati as chairman of the Fifth Assembly.

=== Sixth Assembly (2024–present) ===

The election of 88 members of the Sixth Assembly took place on 1 March 2024 alongside of the election for 290 members of the Iranian Majlis (parliament). Conservatives dominated the assembly elections Those elected will sit for a projected 8-year term. The new assembly was opened on 21 May 2024 and selected Mohammad-Ali Movahedi Kermani as chairman of the Sixth Assembly.

==Authority==
The Assembly has never dismissed or even questioned the Supreme Leader. Due to Ali Khamenei&#x27;s lengthy, unchallenged reign, many believe that the Assembly of Experts has become a ceremonial body without any real power. Iran&#x27;s then-Chief Justice Sadeq Larijani, a Khamenei appointee, has stated that it is illegal for the Assembly of Experts to supervise Khamenei.

There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader&#x27;s public criticism of members of the Assembly of Experts was followed by their arrest and dismissal. For example, Khamenei publicly called member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Qomi&#x27;s arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. Another instance is when Khamenei indirectly called the late Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a traitor for a statement he made, causing Rafsanjani to retract it. Mehdi Karroubi, who has been under house arrest since 2011 without trial, by the direct order of Khamenei, said that &quot;the Assembly of Experts, a council of elected clerics charged with electing, supervising and even disqualifying the Supreme Leader, has turned into a ceremonial council that only praises the Leader&quot;.

<doc id="512728" wikidata="Q326128" url="?curid=512728" title="Germanisation">
<text>Germanisation, or Germanization, is the spread of the German language, people, and culture. It was a central idea of German conservative thought in the 19th and the 20th centuries, when conservatism and ethnic nationalism went hand in hand. In linguistics, Germanisation of non-German languages also occurs when they adopt many German words.

Under the policies of states such as the Teutonic Order, Austria, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the German Empire, non-German minorities were often discouraged or even prohibited from using their native language, and had their traditions and culture suppressed in the name of linguistic imperialism. In addition, the Government also encouraged immigration from the Germanosphere to further upset the linguistic balance, but with varying degrees of success. In Nazi Germany, linguistic Germanisation was replaced by a policy of genocide against certain ethnic groups like Poles, Baltic natives, and Czechoslovaks, even when they were already German-speaking.

==Forms==
Historically there are different forms and degrees of the expansion of the German language and of elements of German culture. There are examples of complete assimilation into German culture, as happened with the pagan Slavs in the Diocese of Bamberg (Franconia) in the 11th century. An example of the eclectic adoption of German culture is the field of law in Imperial and present-day Japan, which is organised according to the model of the German Empire. Germanisation took place by cultural contact, by political decision of the adopting party, or by force.

In Slavic countries, the term &quot;Germanisation&quot; is often understood to mean the process of acculturation of Slavic- and Baltic-language speakers – after conquest by or cultural contact with Germans in the early Middle Ages; especially the areas of modern southern Austria and extant part of German East Elbia. In East Prussia, decimation and forced resettlement of the original Baltic Old Prussians by the Teutonic Order as well as acculturation by immigrants from various European countries, primarily Germans, but also Poles (Catholic Warmians and Protestant Masurians who both descended from Masovians, as well as Catholic Powiślans who descended from Chełminians and Kociewians), Lithuanians (Prussian Lithuanians) and Bohemians, contributed to the eventual extinction of the Prussian language in the 17th century. Germanisation in its modern form was conducted from the beginning of the 19th century as a set of Prussian/German and (to a lesser degree and for a shorter time) Austrian state policies of forceful imposition of German culture, language and people upon non-German people, Slavs in particular.

Since the flight and expulsion of Germans from Central and Eastern Europe at the end of and after World War II, however, these territories have been mostly degermanised.

==Early history==
Early Germanisation went along with the Ostsiedlung during the Middle Ages in Hanoverian Wendland, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Lusatia, and other areas, formerly inhabited by Slavic tribes – Polabian Slavs such as Obotrites, Veleti and Sorbs. Early forms of Germanisation were recorded by German monks in manuscripts such as Chronicon Slavorum.

Since the Late Middle Ages, the Silesian Piasts and Pomeranian Griffins invited German settlers to settle in many areas constituting the Kingdom of Poland prior to its fragmentation while the Santok Castellany was outright sold to Brandenburg by the Piast dukes of Greater Poland. As a result, Silesia, Pomerania (in the narrow sense) and Lubusz Land joined the Holy Roman Empire, as a natural consequence becoming gradually Germanised in the following centuries. Proto-Slovene was spoken in a much larger territory than modern Slovenia, which included most of the present-day Austrian states of Carinthia and Styria, as well as East Tyrol, the Val Pusteria in South Tyrol, and some parts of Upper and Lower Austria. By the 15th century, most of these areas had been gradually Germanised.

Historians have also noted that Ostsiedlung did not include deliberate Germanization, which in pre-national times was beyond imagination.

Outside of the HRE, the Old Prussians, originally a Baltic ethnic group, were Germanised by the Teutonic Knights who adopted a very different approach. When the State of the Teutonic Order unexpectingly seized Polish Pomerelia by force and decimated its population, launching at the same time a massive campaign to attract and ressetle to these areas as many German colonists as possible within a relatively short period. This event also produced the first historical record of a major German thinker openly calling for the genocide of the Polish people; the 14th-century German Dominican theologian Johannes von Falkenberg argued on behalf of the Teutonic Order not only that Polish pagans should be killed, but that all Poles should be subject to genocide on the grounds that Poles were an inherently heretical race and that even the King of Poland, Jogaila, a Christian convert, ought to be murdered. The assertion that Poles were heretical was largely politically motivated as the Teutonic Order desired to conquer Polish lands despite Christianity having become the dominant religion in Poland centuries prior. Such views did not remain purely ideas but were also put into practice in the wake of events such as the Slaughter of Gdańsk whose German population only achieved the majority after local Polish population was murdered and a new settlement was built by Teutonic Knights. The carnage was so extensive that it prompted the pope Clement V to condemn the Teutonic Knights in a bull which charged them with committing a massacre 

The Teutonic Order did however not deliberately pursue Germanization. Germanization was rather the result of the colonial nature of the State. This is corroborated by the fact that Order&#x27;s politics also resulted in Polonization in some areas of the Teutonic State, and Lithuanization in other areas. Correspondingly, even in villages under German right, there were Polish farmers and even a Polish Schultheiß is recorded.

==Modern Germanisation==
===Differences in Austrian and Prussian approaches===
In respect to Austria, northern border of Slovene-speaking territory stabilised on a line from north of Klagenfurt to the south of Villach and east of Hermagor in Carinthia, while in Styria it closely followed the current Austrian-Slovenian border. This linguistic border remained almost unchanged until the late 19th century, when the second process of Germanisation took place, mostly in Carinthia. Germanisation of the Ladino-Romantsch Venosta Valley in Tyrol was also undertaken by Austria in the 16th century. Following the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, at the time one of the last meaningful territories of the HRE not dominated yet by the German language, was subjected to two centuries of recatholicization of the Czech lands accompanied by growing influence of German-speaking elites, at the expense of declining the Czech-speaking aristocracy, elite Czech language usage in general. Despite the great importance to Czech literature of poets and writers of the era like Bedřich Bridel, Czech nationalist historians and writers such as Alois Jirásek have referred to the 17th and 18th century in the Czech lands as the Dark Age. As a further step, 
Emperor Joseph II () sought to consolidate the territories of Habsburg Monarchy within the Holy Roman Empire with those remaining outside of it, to centralise the government, and to implement Enlightenment principles through absolutism. He decreed that Austrian German was to replace Ecclesiastical Latin as the official language of Government. Hungarians, however, perceived Joseph&#x27;s language reforms as an act of linguistic imperialism and cultural hegemony, and they responded by insisting on using their heritage language. As a result, the lower Hungarian nobility launched a literary renaissance of the Hungarian language and culture. These lesser nobles often questioned the loyalty of the magnates, less than half of whom were ethnic Hungarians, and many of these had become French- and German-speaking courtiers. The Hungarian national revival was so successful that the Government in Budapest did not learn anything from the failure of Emperor Joseph II&#x27;s linguistic policies and, following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, unwisely launched a coercive Magyarization policy aimed at forcibly assimilating the many speakers of &quot;other&quot; minority languages within the Kingdom of Hungary, which ultimately triggered a domino effect. Anti-Hungarian and heritage language revival movements arose in Transleithania among Slovaks, Romanians, Serbians, and Croatians within the Kingdom of Hungary, triggering in Cisleithania the Czech National Revival and United Slovenia movements, in both parts of the Habsburg Monarchy the Croatian Illyrian movement, as well as in the Bosnia and Herzegovina condominium the Bosnian movement, some of them ultimately forming Yugoslavism, while the Polish and Ukrainian-speaking population of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria benefitted from the broadening of Galician autonomy.
During the 18th-century, a more harsh and brutal form of Germanisation efforts, initially practiced in Farther Pomerania and East Prussia and extended following the Silesian Wars also to Silesia and County of Kladsko gained from the Lands of the Bohemian Crown as well as later to the terrories of Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the Starostwo of Draheim pawned by Poland, was introduced by Frederick the Great as a result of the partitions of Poland to the newly gained Polish territories of Greater Poland, Pomerelia, Warmia and Malbork Land. The Prussian authorities settled German-speaking Protestants in these areas. Frederick the Great settled around 300,000 colonists in the eastern provinces of Prussia. He aimed at a removal of the Polish nobility, which he viewed with contempt, describing ethnic Poles in newly reconquered West Prussia as &quot;slovenly Polish trash&quot; and compared Poles to the Iroquois. From the start of Prussian rule Poles were subject to a series of measures against their culture: the Polish language was replaced by German as the official language; most administrative positions were filled by Germans. Poles were portrayed as &quot;backward Slavs&quot; by Prussian officials who wanted to spread Protestantism in the German language. The estates of the Polish nobility were confiscated and given to Protestant members of the German nobility.

===Polish territories===

After the Napoleonic Wars, Austria remained in possession of parts of Lesser Poland, Galicia, Volhynia, as well as a minor share of Silesia. Prussia in turn not only retained the bulk of Upper Silesia but upon dissolution of the Duchy of Warsaw it also reclaimed the entire West Prussia (formed by Pomerelia, the northernmost part of Greater Poland and a strip of historical Prussia on the right bank of Vistula) and, most importantly, obtained the bulk of Greater Poland where an autonomous polity was formed under the name of Grand Duchy of Posen with an officially stated purpose to provide its overwhelmingly Polish population a degree of autonomy; in May 1815 King Frederick William III issued a manifest to the Poles in Posen:
You also have a Fatherland. [...] You will be incorporated into my monarchy without having to renounce your nationality. [...] You will receive a constitution like the other provinces of my kingdom. Your religion will be upheld. [...] Your language shall be used like the German language in all public affairs and everyone of you with suitable capabilities shall get the opportunity to get an appointment to a public office. [...]

As a result, there was an easing of Germanisation policy in the period 1815–30. The minister for Education Altenstein stated in 1823:
Concerning the spread of the German language it is most important to get a clear understanding of the aims, whether it should be the aim to promote the understanding of German among Polish-speaking subjects or whether it should be the aim to gradually and slowly Germanise the Poles. According to the judgement of the minister only the first is necessary, advisable and possible, the second is not advisable and not accomplishable. To be good subjects it is desirable for the Poles to understand the language of government. However, it is not necessary for them to give up or postpone their mother language. The possession of two languages shall not be seen as a disadvantage but as a benefit instead because it is usually associated with a higher flexibility of the mind. [..] Religion and language are the highest sanctuaries of a nation and all attitudes and perceptions are founded on them. A government that [...] is indifferent or even hostile against them creates bitterness, debases the nation and generates disloyal subjects.

Later the first half of the 19th century, Prussian policy towards Poles turned again to discrimination and Germanisation. From 1819 the state gradually reduced the role of the Polish language in schools, with German being introduced in its place. This policy was likely also inspired by English and French examples of using schools for asserting the national language.

In 1825 August Jacob, a politician hostile to Poles, gained power over the newly created Provincial Educational Collegium in Poznan. Across the Polish territories Polish teachers were removed, German educational programmes were introduced, and primary schooling was aimed at the creation of loyal Prussian citizens. In 1825 the teacher&#x27;s seminary in Bydgoszcz was Germanised. Successive policies aimed at the elimination of non-German languages from public life and from academic settings, such as schools. Subsequently, there was an intensification of Germanisation and persecution of Poles in the Province of Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Posen in 1830–41.
After a brief period of thaw in the years 1841–49, Bismarck intensified Germanisation again during 1849–70 as part of his Kulturkampf against Catholicism in general, but in particular against Polish Catholics. It was the policy of the Kingdom of Prussia to seek a degree of linguistic and cultural Germanisation, while in Imperial Germany a more intense form of cultural Germanisation was pursued, often with explicit intention of reducing the influence of other cultures or institutions, such as the Catholic Church. In the German Empire, Poles were portrayed as &quot;Reichsfeinde&quot; (&quot;foes of the Empire&quot;). In 1885 the Prussian Settlement Commission, financed by the national government, was set up to buy land from non-Germans and distribute it to German farmers. From 1908 the committee was entitled to force the landowners to sell the land. Other means of oppression included the Prussian deportations from 1885 to 1890, in which non-Prussian nationals who lived in Prussia, mostly Poles and Jews, were removed; and a ban issued on the building of houses by non-Germans. (See Drzymała&#x27;s van.) Germanisation in schools included the abuse of Polish children by Prussian officials. Germanisation stimulated resistance, usually in the form of home schooling and tighter unity in minority groups. There was a slight easing of the persecution of Poles during 1890–94. A continuation and intensification of measures restarted in 1894 and continued until the end of World War I. In 1910, the Polish poet Maria Konopnicka responded to the increasing persecution of Polish people by Germans by writing her famous poem entitled &quot;Rota&quot;; it immediately became a national symbol for Poles, with its sentence known to many Poles: &quot;The German will not spit in our face, nor will he Germanise our children&quot;. An international meeting of socialists held in Brussels in 1902 condemned the Germanisation of Poles in Prussia, calling it &quot;barbarous&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Austrian-ruled Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria operated two Polish-speaking universities and in 1867 obtained even consent to adopt Polish as its official government language. The Galician Government also foolishly launched a Polonisation policy which triggered a Ukrainian language revival, which was encouraged by the Austrian government, not only to &quot;divide and rule&quot;, but, more importantly, to create an alternative to the Tsarist-backed Galician Russophiles and to &quot;return the favor&quot; by similarly destabilizing the Russification of Ukraine. In defiance of the Valuev Circular, the Ems Ukaz, and censorship in the Russian Empire, Ukrainian-language literature was published in Galicia and smuggled across the Russian border with Austrian Government backing.

===Lithuania Minor===
Prussian Lithuanians experienced similar policies of Germanisation restarting from the 15th century. Although ethnic Lithuanians had constituted a majority in areas of East Prussia during the 15th and 16th centuriesfrom the early 16th century it was often referred to as Lithuania Minorthe Lithuanian population shrank in the 18th century. The plague and subsequent immigration from Germany, notably from Salzburg, were the primary factors in this development. Germanisation policies were tightened during the 19th century, but even into the early 20th century the territories north, south and south-west of the Neman River contained a Lithuanian majority.

===Polish coal miners in the Ruhr Valley===

Due to migration within the German Empire as many as 350,000 ethnic Poles made their way to the Ruhr area in the late 19th century, where they largely worked in the coal and iron industries. German authorities viewed them as a potential danger as a &quot;suspected political and national&quot; element. All Polish workers had special cards and were under constant observation by German authorities. Their citizens&#x27; rights were also limited by the state.

In response to these policies, the Polish formed their own organisations to maintain their interests and ethnic identity. The &quot;Sokol&quot; sports clubs, the workers&#x27; union &quot;Zjednoczenie Zawodowe Polskie&quot; (ZZP), &quot;Wiarus Polski&quot; (press), and &quot;Bank Robotnikow&quot; were among the best-known such organisations in the Ruhr. At first, the Polish workers, ostracised by their German counterparts, had supported the Catholic centre party. During the early 20th century, their support shifted increasingly towards the social democrats. In 1905 Polish and German workers organised their first common strike. Under the &quot;Namensänderungsgesetz&quot; (law of changing surnames), a significant number of &quot;Ruhr-Poles&quot; changed their surnames and Christian names to Germanised forms, in order to evade ethnic discrimination. As the Prussian authorities suppressed Catholic services in Polish by Polish priests during the Kulturkampf, the Poles had to rely on German Catholic priests. Increasing intermarriage between Germans and Poles contributed much to the Germanisation of ethnic Poles in the Ruhr area.

===Other minorities===
Successive policies aimed at the elimination of non-German languages from public life and from academic settings, such as schools. For example, in the course of the second half of the 19th century, the Dutch language, historically spoken in what is now Cleves, Geldern and Emmerich, was banned from schools and the administration and ceased to be spoken in its standardised form by the turn of the century. Later in the German Empire, in parallel with Poles, Danes, Dutch, Alsatians, German Catholics and Socialists, were portrayed as &quot;Reichsfeinde&quot; (&quot;foes of the Empire&quot;).

==Contemporary Germanization==
===Interwar period===
During the Weimar Republic, Poles were recognised as a minority in Upper Silesia. The peace treaties after the First World War contained an obligation for Poland to protect its national minorities (Germans, Ukrainians and other), whereas no such clause was introduced by the victors in the Treaty of Versailles for Germany. In 1928 the &quot;Minderheitenschulgesetz&quot; (minorities school act) regulated the education of minority children in their native tongue. From 1930 onwards Poland and Germany agreed to treat their minorities fairly. Such position was officially maintained by Germany even for some time after the Nazi takeover, but ceased towards the end of 1937.

The Nazi party advocated an explicitly ethno-racialist and bio-political concept of Germanization. Adolf Hitler wrote in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;: 

===World War II===
====Plans====

The Nazis considered land to the eastPoland, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, and the Baltics to be &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) and sought to populate it with Germans. Hitler, speaking with generals immediately prior to his chancellorship, declared that people could not be Germanised, only the soil could be.

The policy of Germanisation in the Nazi period carried an explicitly ethno-racial rather than purely nationalist meaning, aiming for the spread of a &quot;biologically superior&quot; Aryan race rather than that of the German nation. This did not mean a total extermination of all people in eastern Europe, as it was regarded as having people of Aryan/Nordic descent, particularly among their ruling class. Himmler declared that no drop of German blood would be lost or left behind for an alien race. In Nazi documents even the term &quot;German&quot; can be problematic, since it could be used to refer to people classified as &quot;ethnic Germans&quot; who spoke no German.

Inside Germany, propaganda, such the film &quot;Heimkehr&quot;, depicted these ethnic Germans as persecuted, and the use of military force as necessary to protect them. The exploitation of ethnic Germans as forced labour and persecution of them were major themes of the anti-Polish propaganda campaign of 1939, prior to the invasion. The bloody Sunday incident during the invasion was widely exploited as depicting the Poles as murderous towards Germans.

In a top-secret memorandum, &quot;The Treatment of Racial Aliens in the East&quot;, dated 25May 1940, Himmler wrote &quot;We need to divide Poland&#x27;s different ethnic groups up into as many parts and splinter groups as possible&quot;. There were two Germanisation actions in occupied Poland realised in this way:
* The grouping of Polish Gorals (&quot;Highlanders&quot;) into the hypothetical Goralenvolk, a project which was ultimately abandoned due to lack of support among the Goral population;
* The assignment of West Slavic Kashubians of Pomerania and Silesians of Silesia as &quot;Deutsche Volksliste&quot;, as they were considered capable of assimilation into the German populationseveral high-ranking Nazis deemed them to be descended from ancient Gothic peoples.

====Selection and expulsion====

Germanisation began with the classification of people as defined on the Nazi Volksliste. The Germans regarded the holding of active leadership roles as an Aryan trait, whereas a tendency to avoid leadership and a perceived fatalism was associated by many Germans with Slavonic peoples. Adults who were selected for but resisted Germanisation were executed. Such execution was carried out on the grounds that German blood should not support non-Germanic people, and that killing them would deprive foreign nations of superior leaders. The intelligenzaktion was justified, even though these elites were regarded as likely to be of German blood, because such blood enabled them to provide leadership for the fatalistic Slavs. Germanising &quot;racially valuable&quot; elements would prevent any increase in the Polish intelligenstia, as the dynamic leadership would have to come from German blood. In 1940 Hitler made it clear that the Czech intelligentsia and the &quot;mongoloid&quot; types of the Czech population were not to be Germanised.

Under &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;, a percentage of Slavs in the conquered territories were to be Germanised. Gauleiters Albert Forster and Arthur Greiser reported to Hitler that 10 percent of the Polish population contained &quot;Germanic blood&quot;, and were thus suitable for Germanisation. The Reichskommissars in northern and central Russia reported similar figures. Those unfit for Germanisation were to be expelled from the areas marked out for German settlement. In considering the fate of the individual nations, the architects of the Plan decided that it would be possible to Germanise about 50 percent of the Czechs, 35 percent of the Ukrainians and 25 percent of the Belarusians. The remainder would be deported to western Siberia and other regions. In 1941, it was decided that the Polish nation should be completely destroyed in about 10 to 20 years so that it could be re-settled by German colonists.

In the Baltic States the Nazis initially encouraged the departure of ethnic Germans by the use of propaganda. This included using scare tactics about the Soviet Union, and led to tens of thousands leaving. Those who left were not referred to as &quot;refugees&quot;, but were rather described as &quot;answering the call of the Führer&quot;. German propaganda films such as &quot;The Red Terror&quot; and &quot;Frisians in Peril&quot; depicted the Baltic Germans as deeply persecuted in their native lands. Packed into camps for racial evaluation, they were divided into groups: A, &quot;Altreich&quot;, who were to be settled in Germany and allowed neither farms nor businesses (to allow close supervision); S &quot;Sonderfall&quot;, who were used as forced labour; and O &quot;Ost-Fälle&quot;, the best classification, to be settled in the occupied regions and allowed independence. This last group was often given Polish homes where the families had been evicted so quickly that half-eaten meals were on tables and small children had clearly been taken from unmade beds. Members of the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls were assigned the task of overseeing such evictions and ensuring that the Poles left behind most of their belongings for the use of the settlers. The deportation orders required that enough Poles be removed to provide for every settlerthat, for instance, if twenty German master bakers were sent, twenty Polish bakeries had to have their owners removed.

====Settlement and Germanisation====

This colonisation involved 350,000 such Baltic Germans and 1.7 million Poles deemed Germanisable, including between one and two hundred thousand children who had been taken from their parents, and about 400,000 German settlers from the &quot;Old Reich&quot;. Nazi authorities feared that these settlers would be tainted by their Polish neighbours and warned them not to let their &quot;foreign and alien&quot; surroundings have an impact on their Germanness. They were also settled in compact communities, which could be easily monitored by the police. Only families classified as &quot;highly valuable&quot; were kept together.

For Poles who did not resist the resettled ethnic Germans, Germanisation began. Militant party members were sent to teach them to be &quot;true Germans&quot;. The Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls sent young people for &quot;Eastern Service&quot;, which entailed assisting in Germanisation efforts. Germanisation included instruction in the German language, as many spoke only Polish or Russian. Goebbels and other propagandists worked to establish cultural centres and other means to create &quot;Volkstum&quot; or racial consciousness in the settlers. This was needed to perpetuate their work; only by effective Germanisation could mothers, in particular, create the German home. Goebbels was also the official patron of &quot;Deutsches Ordensland&quot; or Land of Germanic Order, an organisation to promote Germanisation. These efforts were used in propaganda in Germany, as when &quot;NS-Frauen-Warte&quot;″s cover article was on &quot;Germany is building in the East&quot;.

====Yugoslavia====
On 6 April 1941 Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis Powers. Part of the Slovene-settled territory was occupied by Nazi Germany. The Gestapo arrived on 16April 1941 and were followed three days later by SS leader Heinrich Himmler, who inspected Stari Pisker Prison in Celje. On 26April, Adolf Hitler, who encouraged his followers to &quot;make this land German again&quot;, visited Maribor. Although the Slovenes had been deemed racially salvageable by the Nazis, the mainly Austrian authorities of the Carinthian and Styrian regions commenced a brutal campaign to destroy them as a nation.
The Nazis started a policy of violent Germanisation on Slovene territory, attempting to either discourage or entirely suppress Slovene culture. Their main task in Slovenia was the removal of part of population and Germanisation of the rest. Two organisations were instrumental in the Germanisation: the Styrian Homeland Union (&quot;Steirischer Heimatbund&quot; – HS) and the Carinthian People&#x27;s Union (&quot;Kärtner Volksbund&quot; – KV).

In Styria the Germanisation of Slovenes was controlled by SS-Sturmbannführer Franz Steindl. In Carinthia a similar policy was conducted by Wilhelm Schick, the gauleiter&#x27;s close associate. Public use of Slovene was prohibited, geographic and topographic names were changed and all Slovene associations were dissolved. Members of all professional and intellectual groups, including many clergymen, were expelled as they were seen as obstacles to Germanisation. As a reaction, a resistance movement developed. The Germans who wanted to proclaim their formal annexation to the &quot;German Reich&quot; on 1October 1941, postponed it first because of the installation of the new gauleiter and &quot;reichsstatthalter&quot; of Carinthia and later they dropped the plan for an indefinite period because of Slovene partisans. Only the Meža Valley became part of Reichsgau Carinthia. Around 80,000 Slovenes were forcibly deported to Eastern Germany for potential Germanisation or forced labour. The deported Slovenes were taken to several camps in Saxony, where they were forced to work on German farms or in factories run by German industries from 1941 to 1945. The forced labourers were not always kept in formal concentration camps, but often vacant buildings.

Nazi Germany also began mass expulsions of Slovenes to Serbia and Croatia. The basis for the recognition of Slovenes as German nationals was the decision of the Imperial Ministry for the Interior from 14April 1942. This was the basis for drafting Slovenes for the service in the German armed forces. The number of Slovenes conscripted to the German military and paramilitary formations has been estimated at 150,000 men and women. Almost a quarter of them lost their lives, mostly on the Eastern Front. An unknown number of &quot;stolen children&quot; were taken to Nazi Germany for Germanisation.

====USSR====
Ukraine was targeted for Germanisation. Thirty special SS squads took over villages where ethnic Germans predominated and expelled or shot Jews or Slavs living in them. The Hegewald colony was set up in Ukraine. Ukrainians were forcibly deported, and ethnic Germans forcibly relocated there. Racial assignment was carried out in a confused manner: the Reich rule was three German grandparents, but some asserted that any person who acted like a German and evinced no &quot;racial concerns&quot; should be eligible.

Plans to eliminate Slavs from Soviet territory to allow German settlement included starvation. Nazi leaders expected that millions would die after they removed food supplies. This was regarded as advantageous by Nazi officials. When Hitler received a report of many well-fed Ukrainian children, he declared that the promotion of contraception and abortion was urgently needed, and neither medical care nor education was to be provided.

===Eastern workers===

When young women from the East were recruited to work as nannies in Germany, they were required to be suitable for Germanisation, both because they would work with German children, and because they might be sexually exploited. The programme was praised for not only allowing more women to have children as their new domestic servants were able to assist them, but for reclaiming German blood and giving opportunities to the women, who would work in Germany, and might marry there.

===Kidnapping of Eastern European children===

&quot;Racially acceptable&quot; children were taken from their families in order to be brought up as Germans. Children were selected for &quot;racially valuable traits&quot; before being shipped to Germany. Many Nazis were astounded at the number of Polish children found to exhibit &quot;Nordic&quot; traits, but assumed that all such children were genuinely German children, who had been Polonised. Hans Frank exhibited such views when he declared, &quot;When we see a blue-eyed child we are surprised that she is speaking Polish.&quot; The term used for them was &quot;wiedereindeutschungsfähig&quot;—meaning capable of being re-Germanised. These might include the children of people executed for resisting Germanisation. If attempts to Germanise them failed, or they were determined to be unfit, they would be killed to eliminate their value to the opponents of the Reich.

In German-occupied Poland, it is estimated that 50,000 to 200,000 children were removed from their families to be Germanised. The Kinder KZ was founded specifically to hold such children. It is estimated that at least 10,000 of them were murdered in the process as they were determined unfit and sent to concentration camps. Only 10–15% returned to their families after the war.

Many children, particularly Polish and Slovenian, declared on being found by Allied forces that they were German. Russian and Ukrainian children had been taught to hate their native countries and did not want to return.

===Western Germanisation===
In contemporary German usage the process of Germanisation was referred to as &quot;Germanisierung&quot; (Germanicisation, i.e., to make something German-ic) rather than &quot;Eindeutschung&quot; (Germanisation, i.e., to make something German). According to Nazi racial theories, the Germanic peoples of Europe such as the Scandinavians, the Dutch, and the Flemish, were a part of the Aryan master race, regardless of these peoples&#x27; own acknowledgement of their &quot;Aryan&quot; identity.

Germanisation in these conquered countries proceeded more slowly. The Nazis had a need for local cooperation and the countries were regarded as more racially acceptable. Racial categories for the average German meant &quot;East is bad and West is acceptable&quot;. The plan was to win the Germanic elements over slowly, through education. Himmler, after a secret tour of Belgium and Holland, happily declared the people would be a racial benefit for Germany. Occupying troops were kept under discipline and instructed to be friendly in order to win the population over. However, evident contradictions limited the policies&#x27; success. Pamphlets, for instance, enjoined all German women to avoid sexual relations with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood.

Various Germanisation plans were implemented. Dutch and Belgian Flemish prisoners of war were sent home quickly, to increase the Germanic population, while Belgian Walloon ones were kept as labourers. Lebensborn homes were set up in Norway for Norwegian women impregnated by German soldiers, with adoption by Norwegian parents being forbidden for any child born there. Alsace-Lorraine was annexed; thousands of residents, those loyal to France as well as Jews and North Africans, were deported to Vichy France. French was forbidden in schools; intransigent French speakers were deported to Germany for re-Germanisation, just as Poles were. Extensive racial classification was practised in France.

==Legacy==
The increasing cultural oppression in Lusatia, Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Pomerelia, Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Galicia and Slovenia driven by the German nationalism triggered as a reaction rise of their own nationalisms in the late 18th and 19th centuries. However, except for the Prussian and Austrian territories of Poland which lost statehood for a relatively brief period and maintained organised movements resiting vigorously Germanisation attempts, national and linguistic identities among the remaining nationalities barely survived the centuries-long cultural dominance of the Germans; for instance, the first modern grammar of the Czech language by Josef Dobrovský (1753–1829) – &quot;Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der böhmischen Sprach&quot; (1809) – was published in German because the Czech language was not used in academic scholarship. From the high Middle Ages until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918 German had a strong impact on Slovene and many Germanisms are preserved in contemporary colloquial Slovene.

In the German colonies, the policy of imposing German as the official language led to the development of German-based pidgins and German-based creole languages, such as Unserdeutsch. Of all the last Kaiser&#x27;s former colonies, however, only Namibia still has a large German-speaking population.

The majority of East Elbia affected by the medieval Ostsiedlung ceased being part of German-speaking Europe as a result of loss of the former eastern territories of Germany in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, with the ensuing Polonisation, or in the case of East Prussia, Lithuanianisation, Polonisation and Russification of these regions, while the Medieval Germanisation of the Kingdom of Bohemia was reversed by the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. Although German irredentism was fuelled for some time after the war by the Federation of Expellees, ultimately the concept of Germanisation became irrelevant in Germany and Austria upon introduction of &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; in the 1970s. Some German-speaking minorities continue though to exist in Europe, such as in the Polish Opole Voivodeship or in Romania and are being supported by the German Federal Government.

In contrast, today&#x27;s Federal Republic of Germany, has classified the Danes, Frisians, and Slavic Sorbs as traditional ethnic and linguistic minorities which are guaranteed cultural autonomy by both the federal and state governments. There is a treaty between Denmark and Germany from 1955 regulating the linguistic rights of the German-speaking minority in Denmark and vice versa. The north German state of Schleswig-Holstein has also passed a law aimed at preserving the Frisian language.

<doc id="512734" wikidata="Q10819" url="?curid=512734" title="Mariano Rajoy">
<text>Mariano Rajoy Brey (, ; born 27 March 1955), is a Spanish politician who served as Prime Minister of Spain from 2011 to 2018, when a vote of no confidence ousted his government. On 5 June 2018, he announced his resignation as People&#x27;s Party leader.

He became Leader of the People&#x27;s Party in 2004 and prime minister in 2011 following the People&#x27;s Party landslide victory in that year&#x27;s general election, becoming the sixth president of the Spanish Government since the restoration of democracy. The party lost its majority in the 2015 general election, but after that election ended in deadlock, a second election in 2016 enabled Rajoy to be reelected prime minister as head of a minority government. Rajoy was a minister under the José María Aznar administration, occupying different leading roles in different ministries between 1996 and 2003, and he also was the deputy prime minister between 2000 and 2003. He was the Leader of the Opposition between 2004 and 2011 under José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&#x27;s government.

Rajoy&#x27;s first term was heavily marked by the Spanish financial crisis and oversaw a major restructuring of the Spanish financial system as well as a major labour reform. The financial crisis peaked with a bailout of the Spanish banking system in June 2012. Unemployment in Spain peaked at 27% in 2012, which led to an initial drop of the People&#x27;s Party in the polls, which was aggravated by the revelations of a series of corruption cases that seriously damaged the party&#x27;s reputation. This, among other factors, led to a profound shift in the Spanish party system, with the rise of new political parties from the left and the right: Podemos and Citizens.

The 2015 general election led to a parliamentary configuration that made the formation of a government very difficult; as a result, Spain was without a government for over six months and new elections were held in June 2016. Rajoy was finally appointed prime minister with the support of the Citizens party and the abstention of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. Rajoy&#x27;s second term was marked by economic recovery and a drop in unemployment and the challenge of stagnating salaries. Rajoy also oversaw the 2017–18 Spanish constitutional crisis marked by the Catalan independence referendum of 2017 and the Catalan unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October 2017 that led to the imposition of direct rule in Catalonia.

At 14 years and 146 days, Rajoy was the longest-serving Spanish politician in the Government of Spain since the Spanish transition to democracy, having held ministerial offices continuously from 1996 to 2004 and from 2011 to 2018.

== Early life and education ==
Born 27 March 1955 in Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, Galicia, Rajoy is the grandson of Enrique Rajoy Leloup, one of the architects of the Galician Statute of Autonomy (1936) (&quot;Estatuto de autonomía de Galicia&quot;), who was removed from university teaching by the Franco dictatorship in the early 1950s. He is the son of Olga Brey López and Mariano Rajoy Sobredo, a jurist, and president of the Provincial Court of Pontevedra, the city where he grew up.

Later on, his father was transferred to León and the whole family moved there. He was duly enrolled, together with his brothers Luis and Enrique, and spent ten years there before moving to the Jesuit school in Vigo. After finishing secondary school he started university, enrolling in the Law Faculty in Santiago de Compostela.

Rajoy graduated from the University of Santiago de Compostela and passed the competitive examination required in Spain to enter into the civil service, becoming the youngest-ever property registrar.

He was assigned to Padrón (A Coruña), Villafranca del Bierzo (León) and Santa Pola (Alicante), a position he still holds. In that year, Rajoy sustained facial injuries in a traffic accident. Since then, he has always worn a beard to cover the scars from these injuries.

Rajoy married Elvira &quot;Viri&quot; Fernández Balboa on 28 December 1996, on La Toja Island (Pontevedra). The couple have two children.

While on the campaign trail in 2011, Rajoy published his autobiography, &quot;En Confianza&quot; (&quot;In Confidence&quot;).

== Political career ==

=== Early political career ===
Earlier member of the Spanish National Union (UNE), Rajoy joined the right-wing party People&#x27;s Alliance (AP), becoming a deputy in the inaugural legislature of the Galician Parliament in 1981. In 1982, he was appointed by Galician regional president, Xerardo Fernández Albor, as Minister of Institutional Relations of the Xunta de Galicia. On 11 June 1983, Rajoy was elected President of the Provincial Deputation of Pontevedra, a position he held until 10 December 1986.

In the General Elections of 22 June 1986, he won a seat in the Congress of Deputies as the head of the AP&#x27;s list for Pontevedra, although he resigned in November to take up the post of vice-president of the Xunta of Galicia following the resignation of Xosé Luis Barreiro and the rest of the ministers. He occupied this latter position until the end of September 1987. In May 1988 he was elected General Secretary of the AP in Galicia during an extraordinary congress of the regional party.

When in 1989 the AP merged with other parties to form the People&#x27;s Party (PP), with Manuel Fraga as its president, Rajoy was named a member of its National Executive Committee and delegate for Pontevedra. He was reelected to parliament in 1993. Before the PP&#x27;s triumph in the 1996 elections, he was a PP-designated member of the Commission of Parliamentary Control of the RTVE.

In April, the former president of Castile and León and presidential candidate of the government general elections in 1989, José María Aznar, was elected president of the PP. Confirmed in the National Executive, Mariano Rajoy was appointed deputy secretary general of the party. He was re-elected in Pontevedra in the election on 6 June 1993.

=== Ministerial career (1996–2003) ===
On 3 March 1996, the PP won the early parliamentary elections and formed a government with the support of the Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV), Convergence and Union (CiU) and the Canarian Coalition (CC). Rajoy, a long-time associate of newly elected prime minister José María Aznar, made the move into national politics in Aznar&#x27;s first government when he was appointed Minister of Public Administration on 6 May. His term was marked by the adoption, in 1997, of the Law on organization and operation of the general administration of the State (LOFAGE), which regulates the organization and functions of central government, and the Law on Government.

He changed his portfolio on 20 January 1999 and replaced Esperanza Aguirre as Minister of Education and Culture. Just after his appointment, he was reelected vice-secretary general of the PP during its thirteenth national conference.

In 2000 he led the People&#x27;s Party election campaign for the elections on 12 March, in which they won absolute majority. On 28 April 2000, Rajoy was appointed Senior Vice President of Government and Minister of the Presidency.

Less than a year later, on 28 February 2001, he replaced Jaime Mayor Oreja, candidate for President of the Government of the Basque Country, as Interior Minister. In this role, he passed legislation including the Organic Law on the right of association, approved the decree implementing the Organic Law on the rights and duties of foreigners, and presented the draft law on the prevention of alcoholism.

In the major cabinet reshuffle of 9 July 2002, he became minister of the presidency, retained his vice presidency and was appointed spokesman of the government. In his new role, he faced two very difficult times of Aznar&#x27;s second term: the Prestige oil tanker disaster off the coast of Galicia, and the participation of Spain in the Iraq War, at the request of George W. Bush.

Approached, with Rodrigo Rato and Jaime Mayor Oreja, to succeed José Maria Aznar at the direction of the PP and as presidential candidate of the government in the 2004 general elections, he was chosen as future PP leader on 1 September 2003 and left the government two days later.

=== Leader of the People&#x27;s Party ===
On 30 August 2003, Aznar announced that he would retire from politics in the 2004 elections and proposed Rajoy as his successor. Rajoy was elected Secretary General of the party the following day, and led the party into the 2004 elections. However, the PP&#x27;s large lead evaporated in the wake of the 11-M bombings and the subsequent crisis management, and the PP was heavily defeated by the PSOE.

However, Rajoy was not held responsible for the defeat, and was elected party president at the PP&#x27;s 14th congress in October 2004.

=== Leader of the Opposition (2004–2011) ===

==== 2004 election ====

On 11 March 2004, three days before the 2004 general elections, Madrid was struck by terrorist attacks, which the government initially blamed on the armed Basque separatist organisation, ETA. Aznar&#x27;s government and government party leaders insisted on accusing ETA of the attacks, and on 13 March, Rajoy claimed to believe this because he was convinced of their will and capability for committing such crimes. The government was accused of attempting to blame ETA for the attacks in order to stay on track to win the elections (as they were favored to do), but then the Prisa center-left media company broke news that Al‑Qaida, rather than ETA, was responsible.
On 14 March 2004 the PSOE, under the leadership of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, won the elections with a majority of 1,300,000 votes over the PP, and obtained 164 deputies, while the PP obtained 9,763,144 votes but 148 deputies, 35 less than they obtained in 2000. Rajoy was elected for the province of Madrid.
On 1 December 2005, Rajoy survived a helicopter accident, along with Madrid Regional Government President Esperanza Aguirre; he broke a finger in the accident.

His criticisms of the Zapatero administration were focused on what he perceived as:
* The derogation of ambitious plans of the previous executive
* The &quot;Plan Hidrológico Nacional&quot; (National Hydrological Plan)
* The &quot;LOCE&quot; Organic Law on the Quality of Education
* The alleged &quot;unnecessary&quot; statutory reforms which devolved competences to the autonomous communities, such as submitted in the Catalan, and Andalusian referendums with low turn-outs. According to Rajoy, some of those reforms constituted concealed changes of the autonomous communities towards a confederation, endangering the integrity of the State
* Zapatero&#x27;s view of Spain, which, Rajoy proposed, would require a reform of the Spanish Constitution. Such a reform that would need approval in a national referendum.
* The alleged weakness facing the peace process opened as a result of the permanent ceasefire declared by ETA on 30 December 2006, broken by the Madrid Barajas International Airport bombing and arms robbery
* The legalization of abortion until 14 weeks of pregnancy, a law that Mariano Rajoy considered &quot;criminal&quot; and against the will of large sectors of the Spanish society
In foreign policy:
* The alleged cold relations with United States and Poland.
* The alliances with Latin American left-wing leaders: Hugo Chávez, from Venezuela, Fidel Castro, from Cuba and Evo Morales, from Bolivia.

==== 2008 election ====
Rajoy faced a serious situation within his party when he came under public pressure from the electorally successful Alberto Ruiz Gallardón (Madrid&#x27;s Mayor) to be included in the PP lists for the March 2008 general election. Gallardón represents a more centrist sector within the party, whereas Rajoy, Angel Acebes and Eduardo Zaplana are widely accepted as representing a more conservative wing of the party, closer to Aznar. Rajoy&#x27;s final decision was to leave Gallardón out of the list for those elections, an action which provoked concern about the alienation of potential PP voters. Some experts and newspapers even argued that it could cost Rajoy the elections. In any case, the power struggle for succession created a tense situation for him and for the party.

On 30 January 2008, Rajoy received the support of Germany&#x27;s Angela Merkel and France&#x27;s Nicolas Sarkozy for the March 2008 general election. The PP was defeated in the general election, however, it gained votes and seats, and Rajoy continued to lead his party in opposition.

==== 2011 election ====
The 2011 general election campaign was dominated by economic issues. &quot;Election campaign begins, crushed by the economic situation&quot;, was the headline in &quot;El País&quot; on 2 September 2011; the same day, &quot;El Mundo&quot; claimed that &quot;the unemployment election campaign [had begun]&quot;. The high rate of unemployment was a major issue in the campaign. Close to 5 million people were out of work at the time of the election, and 1.5 million households had no wage earners.

Rajoy slammed Spain&#x27;s unemployment rate as &quot;unbearable and unacceptable&quot; as data showed 4,350 people per day losing their jobs in October 2011. The Socialists, he said, &quot;did not know how to manage Spain&#x27;s economy, and now the Spanish people are paying the price for that&quot;. He promised he would shepherd Spain out of its crisis and recover the shaky confidence of international investors and reduce the government&#x27;s ominously high borrowing costs. The debt crisis in Greece had raised concerns over the solvency of other weak economies like Spain. The PP campaign slogan called on voters to &quot;Join the change!&quot; and the party manifesto stressed its commitment to cutting the country&#x27;s budget deficit in line with EU requirements. It proposed tax breaks for savers and small firms who hired staff; benefits for those who took on young employees; more flexible labour contracts and wage negotiations and major cuts in red tape, to encourage entrepreneurs to set up businesses. At the same time, it pledged to protect public healthcare and education, saving money through efficiency and better management.

== Premiership (2011–2018) ==
===First term (2011–2015)===

In November 2011, Rajoy&#x27;s right-wing People&#x27;s Party won its biggest majority since the country&#x27;s return to representative democracy in the 1970s, securing 186 out of the 350 seats in the lower house of Parliament. Voters turned to him in hopes of alleviating the pain of Europe&#x27;s debt crisis. Following the general election held in 2011, Rajoy was elected prime minister by the Congress of Deputies on 20 December 2011.

====Inauguration====
Rajoy, designated candidate for Prime Minister of the government of King Juan Carlos I, appeared before the Congress of Deputies on 19 December 2011. He stated that to achieve the objective of a deficit of 4.4% of GDP in 2012, an investment of €16,500,000,000 would be needed. He added that his only increased public spending would be the revaluation of pensions, beginning 1 January 2012, and that he would not create any new jobs in the public sector, except for security forces. He stated an intention &quot;to reduce the size of the public sector&quot; and also wanted to reform public holidays so as to avoid encouragement of popular four-day weekends. This would be accomplished by incorporating the use of the nearest Monday for most public holidays. He also announced his desire to end the practice of early retirement.

Rajoy was chosen by Parliament two days later with 187 votes in favor, 149 votes against and 14 abstentions, receiving the support of the People&#x27;s Party, the Forum of Asturias (FAC) and the Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (UPN), with Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), Convergence and Union (CiU), the United Left (IU) and Union, Progress and Democracy (UPyD) dissenting. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV), the coalition Amaiur and the Canary Coalition (CC) abstained. He was appointed a few hours later as prime minister by Juan Carlos I and sworn in the next day at the Zarzuela Palace, before the King and Queen, Zapatero, the outgoing prime minister, and the Presidents of the Cortes Generales, and others.

====First days====
Rajoy&#x27;s government was formed on 21 December 2011 with thirteen ministers—the lowest number in Spanish democratic history. Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, Vice President of the Government, Minister of the Presidency, and government spokesperson, and Ana Pastor Julián, Minister of Equipment, were appointed. The Ministries of Culture, Science, and Territorial Policy were ended, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance was split into two new ministries. The Ministry of Agriculture and Environment was kept intact, despite statements made by Rajoy speech before Congress that indicated the opposite intention. Among the ministers, Cristóbal Montoro Romero, Minister of Finance, and Miguel Arias Cañete, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, had been members of the previous Aznar government and continued to occupy the same posts.

====Spending cuts====
On 30 December 2011, the Council of Ministers approved a cuts plan (called an austerity plan) amounting to €8,900,000,000 in savings and €6,200,000,000 in new revenues. Salaries of public workers were frozen, the workweek in public administration was reduced to 37.5 hours, and recruitment of new public employees was halted, except in the areas of security, health and education. A programme which provided rent assistance for young people was abolished, and the minimum wage was frozen—something that had not happened since 1966. The income tax and tax on real estate was also increased for 2012 and 2013. Pensions were adjusted up 1%, however, and the tax deduction for the purchase of homes was reinstated. The premium of €400 for the long-term unemployed (due to a lack of industry) at the end of law was maintained but only for those registered as jobseekers with the public employment service for at least twelve months out of the previous eighteen and whose income amounts were less than three quarters of the net minimum wage. A 4% value-added tax was expanded to include new home purchases.

====Lawsuit====
On 4 January 2013 the association Democracia Real Ya (DRY), created after the 15 May 2011 protest movement, brought charges against Mariano Rajoy and another 62 deputies (including four ministers) before the Supreme Court, accusing them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Mariano Rajoy was accused of receiving a subsistence allowance despite the fact that he was living in the Moncloa Palace in Madrid. The lawsuit before the Supreme Court was a consequence of the data which had appeared in the media providing information about several deputies who had houses in Madrid but at the same time were receiving extra funds for lodging. According to the association DRY, these representatives, who could be lodged at no cost to the public purse, were paid a monthly subsistence allowance valued at €1,823.36. Furthermore, if they had been elected by the constituency of Madrid and had a house in this city, they were allowed €870 a month to cover accommodation and food expenses resulting from the exercise of their functions that, with respect to Rajoy, were already covered – from the state budget – in the Moncloa Palace. DRY therefore accused them of diversion of public funds and misappropriation. Additionally, DRY demanded that they return all the money that didn&#x27;t belong to them, particularly bearing in mind that &quot;the cuts are making most Spaniards&#x27; life a misery&quot;.

On 24 April 2013, having found no irregularity in the existing regulation and discarding the existence of constituents elements of offense, the Supreme Court rejected the lawsuit.

====Corruption scandals====
The newspaper &quot;El País&quot; published in its edition of 30 January 2013 a series of documents, under the title of &quot;Bárcenas&#x27; secret papers&quot;, referring to the accounts of the conservative party from 1999 to 2009. According to those hand-written documents, Mariano Rajoy and María Dolores de Cospedal had received extra payments in &quot;black&quot; money from the former treasurer of the People&#x27;s Party, Luis Bárcenas.
These documents state that both Bárcenas and his predecessor, Álvaro Lapuerta, managed cash donations from businessmen and private builders (three of whom are additionally accused in the Gürtel case), cited as sources of undeclared income of the PP. Expenditure included, apart from allocations for the effective functioning of the party, payments made to members of the leadership of the party during those years with no explicitly stated purpose.
Barcenas&#x27; accounts show yearly payments of 25,200 euros for 11 years to the President, in addition to smaller amounts for a total estimated at 33,207 with purposes such as &quot;Mariano&#x27;s suits&quot;, &quot;Mariano&#x27;s ties&quot;, or &quot;M.R.&#x27;s suits&quot;. PP Secretary-General María Dolores de Cospedal appears in the papers of these payments, as well as other leaders, such as former ministers Javier Arenas, Jaime Mayor Oreja and Francisco Álvarez-Cascos.

By 7 February, just one week after publication of the documents, one million people had signed a petition launched by the organization Change.org asking for the immediate resignation of Mariano Rajoy.

On 8 July, the center-right newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;, usually a support of the Popular Party, published a four-hour interview with Luis Bárcenas, which had taken place a few days before he was put behind bars on 27 June, in which the former party treasurer revealed that the People&#x27;s Party had been illegally financed for 20 years. The following day, the same newspaper published the originals of Barcenas&#x27; papers which reflected overpayments to Mariano Rajoy in 1997, 1998 and 1999, when he was a minister in the Aznar cabinet. These payments violated the Incompatibilities Act of 1995. On 14 July, &quot;El Mundo&quot; published several text messages between Rajoy and Bárcenas, the latest dating from early 2013, after the discovery of Bárcenas&#x27; bank accounts in Switzerland and after some media had pointed to illegal payments within the PP. In those messages, Rajoy expressed his support to Bárcenas and asked him to keep quiet.
In light of these new revelations, High Court judge Pablo Ruz summoned Bárcenas to appear before him on 15 July. In this new appearance, Bárcenas admitted the payment of 50,000 euros in 2010 to Rajoy and Dolores de Cospedal. As a result of the scandal, all the opposition parties urged Rajoy to give an explanation to parliament, with the opposition Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party threatening him with a censure motion should he refuse to come out and explain himself, and demanding his immediate resignation.

In his appearance before Congress, on 1 August, Rajoy admitted that he had made &quot;a mistake&quot; in trusting Bárcenas and criticised the opposition for trying to &quot;criminalize&quot; him by believing the word of an &quot;offender&quot;, stating that he wasn&#x27;t resigning nor calling new elections. Rajoy also stated that Bárcenas was no longer a member of the PP when he, Rajoy, was appointed prime minister (in December 2011). However, on 11 August, &quot;El Mundo&quot; published a paysheet, dated May 2012, issued by the PP for the ex-treasurer, as well as a letter sent by Bárcenas himself to Rajoy in April 2010 (just a few days after he [Bárcenas] had been officially &quot;removed&quot; from his duties as treasurer) informing Rajoy of his &quot;re-incorporation&quot; in the party. On 26 November 2014, Ana Mato, Minister of Health, resigned due to the involvement of herself and her husband Jesús Sepúlveda in the Gürtel case.

He testified in Audiencia Nacional as a witness in the framework of the investigation into the Gürtel corruption scandal, of the illegal financing of his party. He is the first PM in Spain in service to attend a trial. Although he benefited from this corruption scheme, he denied any knowledge. This situation prompted a no-confidence motion against Rajoy&#x27;s government, which was debated on 13 June and defeated as expected on 14 June. Pío García-Escudero, the President of the Senate also testified as a witness in the same investigation.
On 26 April 2018, his former Minister of Justice, Alberto Ruiz Gallardón, was imputed by the judge for his involvement in the corruption scandal Case Lezo, which involves leaders of the PP in the Community of Madrid.


===2015 general election and deadlock===
The 2015 general election was held on 20 December, the latest possible day. The result was that the People&#x27;s Party remained the most voted-for party, but it lost 64 of its 187 seats and thus its majority. The election produced a fragmented parliament and an uncertain political situation that led to another election in 2016, as neither Rajoy nor the left-wing opposition could form a coalition government. During the electoral campaign, on 16 December, he was punched in the face by a teenager, breaking his glasses. All the political parties, unanimously, condemned the attack. 


===Second term (2016–2018)===
====2016 general election====
In the general election of 26 June 2016, the PP increased its number of seats in parliament, while still falling short of an overall majority. Eventually on 29 October Rajoy was re-appointed as prime minister, after the majority of the PSOE members abstained in the parliamentary vote rather than oppose him.

In February 2016, Rajoy was declared &#x27;persona non grata&#x27; of Pontevedra, his adopted city, because of his cabinet&#x27;s decision to extend the operating license of a controversial cellulose factory by 60 years (see List of people declared persona non grata).

====2017 witness and no confidence-motion====
On 26 July, Rajoy was due to appear as a witness in the Gürtel corruption case. This situation prompted a no-confidence motion against Rajoy&#x27;s government, which was debated on 13 June and defeated as expected on 14 June.

====Terrorist attacks in Barcelona and Cambrils====

On the afternoon of 17 August 2017, Younes Abouyaaqoub murdered 15 people and wounded 130 in an attack on Las Ramblas in Barcelona through vehicle-ramming attack and stabbed one person while fleeing.

Few hours later, five men from the same terrorist cell drove into pedestrians in Cambrils, a coastal town one hour from Barcelona. One woman was fatally stabbed and six persons injured. All five attackers were killed by the police.

====Catalan independence referendum====

On 1 October 2017, an illegal referendum took place in Catalonia that descended into chaos after the police attempted to halt voting by forcibly and violently removing voters from polling stations. Although Governments around the world refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the vote, Rajoy was widely criticized by political analysts around the world for his response, with most suggesting that he should simply have ignored the referendum. Rajoy oversaw the 2017-18 Spanish constitutional crisis marked by this referendum, and the Catalan unilateral declaration of independence that led to the imposition of direct rule in Catalonia on 27 October 2017.

====2018 motion of no confidence====

The first definitive court ruling on the Gürtel corruption scandal convicted a series of former PP party officials. Former treasurer Luis Bárcenas was sentenced to 33 years of prison and a fine of 44 million euros for hiding a fortune of an uncertain amount in Swiss banks. The 1,687-page ruling also said that it was settled that there was a &quot;network of institutionalised corruption&quot; and that the PP &quot;financially benefited&quot; from the Gürtel affair, something for which it was fined 245,492 euros. The sentence also recognised that it was proven that the PP had a slush fund since 1989, consisting of a &quot;financial and accounting structure that was parallel to the official one&quot;. More court rulings are pending, as this ruling only covered the 1999-2005 period of the Gürtel scandal.

Following the court ruling, the leader of PSOE, Pedro Sánchez, promoted a motion of no confidence against Rajoy to be voted on 1 June. 176 votes were needed to get it approved. In the debate of the previous day, a sufficient number of deputies expressed their intention to support it. Rajoy lost this motion, (with 180 votes in favour of the motion, 169 against, and 1 abstention) and was succeeded as prime minister by Sánchez.

On 5 June 2018, Rajoy announced his resignation as President of the People&#x27;s Party. On 15 June, he resigned his seat as Deputy after thirty years. The vacant seat was taken by Valentina Martínez Ferro.

== Later activity ==
On 20 June 2018, Rajoy was reinstated to his position as property registrar in Santa Pola after 29 years.

On 27 February 2019 he was declared a witness at the trial of Catalonia independence leaders before the Supreme Court.

He was summoned by the courts in March 2021 to explain the &quot;B fund&quot; that the PP has allegedly maintained for more than 20 years. This would have been used to receive anonymous donations from business leaders in order to pay &quot;additional salaries&quot; to party executives, including &quot;Mariano&quot; and &quot;M.Rajoy&quot;.

He supported Javier Milei in 2023 Argentine general election.

== Political positions ==


=== Social issues ===

==== Immigration ====
Rajoy declared himself a strong supporter of allowing migrants to enter Spain, saying Spain would support those seeking asylum. In 2015, he criticised the Hungarian government for taking steps to deter migration into their country. Despite making these statements, the Government of Rajoy was highly criticized for taking anti-immigration measures such as cutting budget to immigration observatories, and the reinforcement of the fence of Melilla, with highly criticised &quot;hot returns&quot; - the illegal expulsion of migrants by the police without any legally established procedures or meeting the international obligations - with police violence eventually taking place. These acts were condemned by the European Court of Human Rights and the UN. The following months, the Rajoy executive refused to repeal the hot returns and appealed the sentence of Strasbourg.

==== Bullfighting ====
Rajoy is a strong supporter of bullfighting. He has said that &quot;the tradition is an art form deeply rooted in Spanish history&quot;. He lifted the ban on live bullfights on state-run television and they are once again shown in the traditional 6 pm slot on TVE.

==== History ====
During the 2015 election campaign, Rajoy asserted that the PP “was the only party defending the unity of Spain.” Among his electoral promises was the creation of a National Museum of Spanish History intended to “defend the unity of Spain.” The location chosen for making this announcement left little doubt about the nationalist undertones of that proposal: the site of the Battle of Covadonga, in the northwestern region of Asturias. That battle is recognized as the first triumph by Christian military forces after the Muslim conquest of the Iberia Peninsula in 711–718. As befits this accomplishment, historians usually consider Covadonga as the site of the beginning of the Reconquista, or the “reconquest” of the Iberian Peninsula by Christian rulers.

=== Foreign policy ===

==== Gibraltar ====
Rajoy wants British-controlled Gibraltar returned to Spain. He described Gibraltar as an “anachronism”, and “the last colony in Europe”.

==== Scottish independence ====
Scotland held a referendum on independence from the United Kingdom on Thursday 18 September 2014. In November 2013, Rajoy stated that an independent Scotland would have to reapply for membership of the European Union, causing considerable irritation to the Scottish Government and criticism that Rajoy was interfering in the internal affairs of another state. Relations between the Spanish and Scottish governments deteriorated further when the Scottish Government alleged that Rajoy invited a senior UK official to visit Madrid allegedly to co-ordinate British and Spanish opposition to the independence movements in Scotland and Catalonia.

=== Anti-egalitarianism ===
During his early political life, Rajoy defended anti-egalitarian stances. In 1983, as the youngest member of the Parliament of Galicia, Rajoy wrote in a piece in the &quot;Faro de Vigo&quot; titled &quot;Human equality and models of society&quot; the notion that &quot;all policies seeking to achieve equality were a fallacy&quot;. As he wrote a year later in another piece for the &quot;Faro de Vigo&quot; titled &quot;La envidia igualitaria&quot; (&quot;The egalitarian envy&quot;, 24 July 1984), when he was already president of the Provincial Deputation of Pontevedra: &quot;Biological equality is not possible. But social equality isn&#x27;t either. [...] As it is demonstrated in an undeniable way that nature, as hierarchic, engenders all human unequal, let&#x27;s avoid exploiting envy and resent laying down the egalitarian dictatorship on such negative impulses&quot;.

<text>The German Army (, &#x27;army&#x27;) is the land component of the armed forces of Germany. The present-day German Army was founded in 1955 as part of the newly formed West German together with the &quot;Marine&quot; (German Navy) and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force). , the German Army had a strength of 63,047 soldiers.

==History==

===Overview===
A German army equipped, organized, and trained following a single doctrine and permanently unified under one command was created in 1871 during the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia. From 1871 to 1919, the title &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot; (German Army) was the official name of the German land forces. Following the German defeat in World War I and the end of the German Empire, the main army was dissolved. From 1921 to 1935 the name of the German land forces was the &quot;Reichsheer&quot; (Army of the Empire) and from 1935 to 1945 the name &quot;Heer&quot; was used. The &quot;Heer&quot; was one of two ground forces of the Third Reich during World War II but, unlike the &quot;Heer&quot;, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; was not a branch of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; but was a combat force under the Nazi Party&#x27;s own &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). The &quot;Heer&quot; was formally disbanded in August 1946.

After World War II, Germany was divided into the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), which both formed their own armed forces: on 12 November 1955 the first recruits began their service in the West German &quot;Heer&quot;, while on 1 March 1956 the East German &quot;Landstreitkräfte der NVA&quot; (Land Forces of the National People&#x27;s Army) were founded. During the Cold War, the West German Army was fully integrated into NATO&#x27;s command structure while the &quot;Landstreitkräfte&quot; were part of the Warsaw Pact. Following the process of German reunification in 1990, the &quot;Landstreitkräfte&quot; were partially integrated into the German Army. Since then, the German Army has been employed in peacekeeping operations worldwide and since 2002 also in combat operations in Afghanistan as part of NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force.

===Founding of the Army===

Following World War II the Allies dissolved the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; with all its branches on 20 August 1946. However already one year after the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany in May 1949 and because of its increasing links with the West under German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, the Consultative Assembly of Europe began to consider the formation of a European Defence Community with German participation on 11 August 1950. Former high-ranking &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers outlined in the Himmeroder memorandum a plan for a &quot;German contingent in an international force for the defense of Western Europe.&quot; For the German land forces the memorandum envisioned the formation of a 250,000 strong army. The officers saw the need for the formation of twelve Panzer divisions and six corps staffs with accompanying Corps troops, as only armoured divisions could muster a fighting force to throw back the numerically far superior forces of the Warsaw Pact.

Theodor Blank was appointed &quot;officer of the Federal Chancellor for the Strengthening of Allied Troops questions&quot;. This Defence Ministry forerunner was known somewhat euphemistically as the Blank Office (Amt Blank), but explicitly used to prepare for the rearmament of West Germany (&quot;Wiederbewaffnung&quot;). By March 1954 the Blank Office had finished plans for a new German army. Plans foresaw the formation of six infantry, four armoured, and two mechanised infantry divisions, as the German contribution to the defense of Western Europe in the framework of a European Defence Community. On 8 February 1952 the Bundestag approved a German contribution to the defense of Western Europe and on 26 February 1954 the Basic Law of the Republic was amended with the insertion of an article regarding the defence of the sovereignty of the federal government. Following a decision at the London Nine Power Conference of 28 September to 3 October 1954, Germany&#x27;s entry into NATO effective from 9 May 1955 was accepted as a replacement for the failed European Defence Community plan. Afterwards the Blank Office was converted to the Defence Ministry and Theodor Blank became the first Defence Minister. The nucleus of army was the so-called &quot;V&quot; Branch of the Department of Defence. Subdivisions included were &quot;VA Leadership and Training,&quot; &quot;VB Organisation&quot; and &quot;VC Logistics.&quot;

The army saw itself explicitly not as a successor to the defeated &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, but as in the traditions of the Prussian military reformers of 1807 to 1814 and the members of the military resistance during National Socialism, such as the officers which undertook the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944. Nevertheless, for lack of alternatives the officer corps was made up largely of former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers. The first Chief of the Army was the former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Hans Rottiger, who had been involved in the drafting of the Himmeroder memorandum.

The official date of the founding of the army is 12 November 1955 when the first soldiers began their service in Andernach. In 1956 the first troops set up seven training companies in Andernach and began the formation of schools and training centers. On 1 April 1957, the first conscripts arrived for service in the army. The first military organisations created were instructional battalions, officer schools, and the Army Academy, the forerunner to the &quot;Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr&quot; in Hamburg. In total of twelve armoured and infantry divisions were to be established by 1959, as planned in Army Structure I. To achieve this goal existing units were split approximately every six months. However the creation of all twelve divisions did not take place until 1965. At the end of 1958 the strength of the army was about 20,200 men. The army was equipped at first with American material, such as the M-47 Patton main battle tank. Three corps commands were formed beginning in 1957: the I Corps, II Corps, and the III Corps.

Also in 1957 the &quot;Office for Territorial Defence&quot; was established as the highest Territorial Army authority. The Office for Territorial Defence was under the direct command of the Federal Ministry of Defence and commanded the Territorial Army (Germany) (&quot;Territorialheer&quot;), a reserve formation. While the &quot;Heer&quot; along with the &quot;Marine&quot; and &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; were firmly integrated into the NATO Military Command Structure, the &quot;Territorialheer&quot; remained under national command. The main function of the &quot;Territorialheer&quot; was to maintain the operational freedom of NATO forces through providing rear area defence against saboteurs, enemy special forces, and the like. There were three Territorial Commands (&quot;Territorialkommandos&quot;), including North, South, and Schleswig-Holstein, and up to six &quot;Wehrbereichskommandos&quot; (WBKs), military regional commands. By 1985 each of the WBKs had two &quot;Heimatschutzbrigades&quot; (HSBs, home defence brigades).
The development of Soviet tactical nuclear weapons required the development of a new Army structure even before Army Structure 1 was fully achieved. To minimize the effects of attacks with tactical nuclear weapons on massed forces, the 28,000 strong divisions of the &quot;Heer&quot; were broken up into smaller and more mobile brigades under Army Structure 2. These smaller units were also to be capable of self-sustainment on a nuclear battlefield for several days, and to be capable of moving quickly from defense and to attack. The new armoured and mechanised brigades were capable of combined arms combat. Each division was composed of three brigades. The armoured brigades consisted of an armoured infantry battalion, two armoured battalions, a self-propelled artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The mechanised brigades consisted of a motorised infantry battalion, two mechanised infantry battalions, an armoured battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The motorised brigades consisted of three motorised infantry battalions, an anti-tank battalion, a field artillery battalion and a supply battalion. The alpine brigades consisted of three alpine battalions, a mountain artillery battalion and a supply battalion. By 1959 the &quot;Heer&quot; consisted of 11 divisions of 27 brigades, four &quot;Panzer&quot; (armoured), four (mechanised), two &quot;Jäger&quot; (motorised), and one &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; (alpine).

From roughly 1970 onward, Army Structure 3 saw the targeted number of 36 active brigades raised by 1975 while the 2nd and 4th divisions were reorganised into &quot;Jäger&quot; formations. The armies &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratrooper) brigades were renamed into &quot;Luftlande&quot; (airborne) brigades and a third brigade (&quot;Luftlandebrigade 27&quot;) was formed.

Under Army Structure 4 from 1980/81 on, the German Army fielded 12 divisions (with 38 active brigades): six &quot;Panzer&quot; (armoured), four (mechanised), one &quot;Luftlande&quot; (airborne), and one &quot;Gebirgs&quot; (alpine) divisions. Ten active divisions were grouped into three corps: I German Corps as part of NATO&#x27;s Northern Army Group, II German Corps and III German Corps as part of Central Army Group. The remaining heavy division (6th Panzergrenadier Division) was part of Allied Forces Baltic Approaches. In peacetime the 1st Airborne Division was assigned to II German Corps with its three brigades to be distributed among the three Corps respectively in wartime, forming a quick reaction reserve. 

The number of active brigades rose compared to Army Structure 3 due to two &quot;Heimatschutz&quot; territorial defense brigades (51 and 56) being assigned to the field army as part of a mechanised and mountain division respectively. The non-NATO assigned territorial army formed 10 further territorial defense brigades for rear area security at varying readiness levels, with most units being partially manned in peacetime and others being entirely non-active units with equipment in storage. 

Brigades in the field army grew to four combat battalions instead of three. Mechanised brigades typically consisted of one &quot;Panzer&quot; and three battalions, of which one was a partially active and mixed formation, containing a tank company and two mechanised companies. Armoured brigades similarly consisted of one and three &quot;Panzer&quot; battalions, with one armoured battalion being mixed and partially active (containing one mechanised and two tank companies). 

Mechanised infantry battalions in mechanised brigades typically had one of three companies equipped as motorised infantry with M113 APCs instead of Marder IFVs.

===Post Cold War===

After 1990, the &quot;Heer&quot; absorbed the &quot;Nationale Volksarmee&quot;, the armed forces of East Germany. The former East German forces were initially controlled by the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; Command East under the command of Lieutenant General Jörg Schönbohm and disbanded on 30 June 1991. In the aftermath of the merger, the German Army consisted of four Corps (including IV Corps at Potsdam in the former DDR) with a manpower of 360,000 men. It was continuously downsized from this point. In 1994 III Corps was reorganised as the German Army Forces Command. In 1996, the 25th Airborne Brigade was converted into a new command leading the Army&#x27;s special forces, known as the &quot;Kommando Spezialkräfte&quot;.

Logistics, CBRN defense, territorial defense and military police units were split off into the newly formed Joint Support Service and medical units into the Joint Medical Service in 2000. The transferred units continue to wear army uniforms.

The 2001 onwards restructuring of the German Army saw it move to a seven division structure – five mechanised (each with two mechanised brigades), one special forces, and one air assault.

In 2003, three Corps still existed, each including various combat formations and a maintenance brigade, as well as the I. German/Dutch Corps, a joint German-Netherlands organization, used to control in peacetime the 1st Panzer and 7th Panzer Divisions as well as Dutch formations. The 1st Panzer would have reported to the corps in wartime while the 7th would be posted to the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. II Corps was German in peacetime but would have exchanged a division with the V U.S. Corps in time of war (the 5th Panzer). The 5th Panzer Division was formally disbanded as of 30 June 2001. In peacetime it also commanded the 10th Panzer Division, which was allocated to Eurocorps and which parents the German half of the Franco-German Brigade. The 1st Mountain Division at Munich was also subordinate to this headquarters.

The IV Corps was headquartered at Potsdam in eastern Germany and controlled two Panzergrenadier Divisions, the 13th and 14th. The 14th Panzergrenadier Division also took control of units in Western Germany re-subordinated from the 6th Panzergrenadier Division when it lost its command function. It would have made up the German contribution to the Multinational Corps Northeast in time of war. IV Corps also used to have under its command the Military District Command I, the 1st Airmobile Brigade, and the Berlin Command (:de:Standortkommando Berlin).

The current structure was assumed with the most recent German Army reform which also suspended conscription by 1 July 2011 and saw the army move to a purely professional three division structure with a view on creating smaller, more flexible and more deployable units, emphasising global employment against non-state threats such as international terrorism or as part of UN and EU missions.

, the German Army had a strength of 62,766 soldiers.

==Structure and organisation==



The German Army is commanded by the Inspector of the Army (&quot;Inspekteur des Heeres&quot;) based at the Army Command (&quot;Kommando Heer&quot;) in Strausberg near Berlin. The training centers are supervised by the Army Training Command in Leipzig.

The combat units of the army now include two armoured divisions and the lighter rapid forces division. Unlike other European armies such as neighbouring France, regiments are not a common form of organization and are thus rare in the German army. Battalions and regiments are directly subordinate to brigades or to divisions as divisional troops. German infantry battalions field 1,000 men, considerably larger than most NATO armies. While some brigades are still designated as either &quot;Panzer&quot; (armour) or (mechanised infantry) formations, these names are by now traditional and no longer imply a different organisation, for example an armoured brigade would not be expected to contain more tanks than a mechanised one.

Trucks:
*Mercedes-Benz Zetros off-road transport truck
*MAN KAT1 high-mobility off-road truck
*Unimog all-wheel drive army personnel or equipment carriers

== Truppengattungen ==
The German Army is divided into several branches, each known as a &quot;Truppengattung&quot;, which might also be part of a &quot;Truppengattungsverbund&quot; which includes several &quot;Truppengattungen&quot;. Each &quot;Waffengattung&quot; carries a certain beret color (except for the mountain troops, who carry a distinctive cap) and uniform markings in a certain &quot;Waffenfarbe&quot;, although the combinations might overlap.

As part of various reorganizations (such as the creation of the Joint Support Service and the Cyber and Information Domain Service) and the reductions in size of the Bundeswehr after 1990, several &quot;Truppengattungen&quot; were dissolved.

&quot;Waffenfarbe&quot; (Army and army support branch only)
* Bright Red: General ranks (only &quot;Kragenspiegel&quot;, not &quot;Litze&quot;),
* Crimson: General Staff

==Rank structure==

The rank structure of the German army is adjusted to the rank structure of NATO. Unlike its predecessors, the modern German Army does not use the rank of Colonel General. The highest rank for an army officer is Lieutenant General, as the rank of Full General is reserved for the Armed Forces chief of staff or officers serving as NATO officers.

<text>In cell biology, cell fractionation is the process used to separate cellular components while preserving individual functions of each component. This is a method that was originally used to demonstrate the cellular location of various biochemical processes. Other uses of subcellular fractionation is to provide an enriched source of a protein for further purification, and facilitate the diagnosis of various disease states.

==Homogenization==

Tissue is typically homogenized in a buffer solution that is isotonic to stop osmotic damage. Mechanisms for homogenization include grinding, mincing, chopping, pressure changes, osmotic shock, freeze-thawing, and ultrasound. The samples are then kept cold to prevent enzymatic damage.
It is the formation of homogenous mass of cells (cell homogenate or cell suspension). It involves grinding of cells in a suitable medium in the presence of certain enzymes with correct pH, ionic composition, and temperature. For example, pectinase which digests middle lamella among plant cells.

==Filtration==

This step may not be necessary depending on the source of the cells. Animal tissue however is likely to yield connective tissue which must be removed. Commonly, filtration is achieved either by pouring through gauze or with a suction filter and the relevant grade ceramic filter.

==Purification==

Purification is achieved by differential centrifugation – the sequential increase in gravitational force results in the sequential separation of organelles according to their density.

<text>William Pollak (born November 10, 1949, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, United States) known by his stage name of Billy Price, is an American soul singer. He has lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, since the mid-1970s.

==Career==
Price attracted national attention in the mid-1970s during his three-year collaboration with blues guitarist Roy Buchanan. The pair toured the US and Canada, playing Carnegie Hall in New York City, the Newport Jazz Festival, the Roxy and Troubadour in Los Angeles, and the Spectrum in Philadelphia. After leaving Buchanan, Price formed the Keystone Rhythm Band, which toured the Eastern US on a circuit that stretched from Boston to Atlanta with large followings in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and North Carolina. Sustaining several personnel changes, the band performed until 1990. He then formed The Billy Price Band, which currently consists of Lenny Smith (guitar), Tom Valentine (bass), Dave Dodd (drums), Jimmy Britton (keyboards), Eric Spaulding (tenor saxophone), and Joe Herndon (trumpet). The Billy Price Band won the Pittsburgh City Paper Reader&#x27;s Poll award as Best Blues Band or Performer in 2021 and 2022.

In April, 2016, Price received a Legends of Pittsburgh Rock &#x27;n Roll Award as a Modern Era Inductee. His 2015 recording with Otis Clay, &quot;This Time for Real&quot;, received a 2016 Blues Music Award (BMA) in the category of Soul Blues Album. His 2018 album &quot;Reckoning&quot; was nominated for a BMA in the category of Soul Blues Album. His album, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, was also nominated for a BMA in the category of Soul Blues Album in 2020. Price was also nominated as Soul Blues Male Artist in 2020, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025; and for Instrumentalist - Vocals in 2024 and 2025.

In 2022, Price released a 3-CD compilation of recordings from throughout his career titled &quot;50+ Years of Soul&quot; on GetHip Recordings.

In 2024, Price released &quot;Person of Interest&quot; on the Little Village label. The recording was nominated for BMAs in the categories of Album of the Year and Soul Blues Album.

In 2024, Price received a Lifetime Career Award from Bluebird Reviews in the UK.

He worked for many years in corporate communications at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University until August, 2023. He continues to perform regularly in Pittsburgh, the eastern United States, and in Europe.

<doc id="512768" wikidata="Q2509459" url="?curid=512768" title="Differential centrifugation">
<text>In biochemistry and cell biology, differential centrifugation (also known as differential velocity centrifugation) is a common procedure used to separate organelles and other sub-cellular particles based on their sedimentation rate. Although often applied in biological analysis, differential centrifugation is a general technique also suitable for crude purification of non-living suspended particles (e.g. nanoparticles, colloidal particles, viruses). In a typical case where differential centrifugation is used to analyze cell-biological phenomena (e.g. organelle distribution), a tissue sample is first lysed to break the cell membranes and release the organelles and cytosol. The lysate is then subjected to repeated centrifugations, where particles that sediment sufficiently quickly at a given centrifugal force for a given time form a compact &quot;pellet&quot; at the bottom of the centrifugation tube.

After each centrifugation, the &quot;supernatant&quot; (non-pelleted solution) is removed from the tube and re-centrifuged at an increased centrifugal force and/or time. Differential centrifugation is suitable for crude separations on the basis of sedimentation rate, but more fine grained purifications may be done on the basis of density through equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation. Thus, the differential centrifugation method is the successive pelleting of particles from the previous supernatant, using increasingly higher centrifugation forces. Cellular organelles separated by differential centrifugation maintain a relatively high degree of normal functioning, as long as they are not subject to denaturing conditions during isolation.

== Theory ==
In a viscous fluid, the &quot;rate&quot; of sedimentation of a given suspended particle (as long as the particle is denser than the fluid) is largely a function of the following factors:
* Gravitational force
* Difference in density
* Fluid viscosity
* Particle size and shape

Larger particles sediment more quickly and at lower centrifugal forces. If a particle is less dense than the fluid (e.g., fats in water), the particle will not sediment, but rather will float, regardless of strength of the g-force experienced by the particle. Centrifugal force separates components not only on the basis of density, but also of particle size and shape. In contrast, a more specialized equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation produces a separation profile dependent on particle-density alone, and therefore is suitable for more fine-grained separations.

High g-force makes sedimentation of small particles much faster than Brownian diffusion, even for very small (nanoscale) particles. When a centrifuge is used, Stokes&#x27; law must be modified to account for the variation in g-force with distance from the center of rotation.

:formula_1

where
* D is the minimum diameter of the particles expected to sediment (m)
* η (or μ) is the fluid dynamic viscosity (Pa.s)
* Rf is the final radius of rotation (m)
* Ri is the initial radius of rotation (m)
* ρp is particle volumetric mass density (kg/m3)
* ρf is the fluid volumetric mass density (kg/m3)
* ω is the angular velocity (radian/s)
* t is the time required to sediment from Ri to Rf (s)

==Procedure==
Differential centrifugation can be used with intact particles (e.g. biological cells, microparticles, nanoparticles), or used to separate the component parts of a given particle. Using the example of a separation of eukaryotic organelles from intact cells, the cell must first be lysed and homogenized (ideally by a gentle technique, such as Dounce homogenization; harsher techniques or over homogenization will lead to a lower proportion of intact organelles). Once the crude organelle extract is obtained, it may be subjected to a varying centrifugation speeds to separate the organelles:

==Ultracentrifugation==
The lysed sample is now ready for centrifugation in an ultracentrifuge. An ultracentrifuge consists of a refrigerated, low-pressure chamber containing a rotor which is driven by an electrical motor capable of high speed rotation. Samples are placed in tubes within or attached to the rotor. Rotational speed may reach up to 100,000 rpm for floor model, 150,000 rpm for bench-top model (Beckman Optima Max-XP or Sorvall MTX150 or himac CS150NX), creating centrifugal speed forces of 800,000g to 1,000,000g. This force causes sedimentation of macromolecules, and can even cause non-uniform distributions of small molecules.

Since different fragments of a cell have different sizes and densities, each fragment will settle into a pellet with different minimum centrifugal forces. Thus, separation of the sample into different layers can be done by first centrifuging the original lysate under weak forces, removing the pellet, then exposing the subsequent supernatants to sequentially greater centrifugal fields. Each time a portion of different density is sedimented to the bottom of the container and extracted, and repeated application produces a rank of layers which includes different parts of the original sample. Additional steps can be taken to further refine each of the obtained pellets.

Sedimentation depends on mass, shape, and partial specific volume of a macromolecule, as well as solvent density, rotor size and rate of rotation. The sedimentation velocity can be monitored during the experiment to calculate molecular weight.
Values of sedimentation coefficient (S) can be calculated. Large values of S (faster sedimentation rate) correspond to larger molecular weight. Dense particle sediments more rapidly. Elongated proteins have larger frictional coefficients, and sediment more slowly to ensure accuracy.
== Differences between differential and density gradient centrifugation ==

The difference between differential and density gradient centrifugation techniques is that the latter method uses solutions of different densities (e.g. sucrose, Ficoll, Percoll) or gels through which the sample passes. This separates the sample into layers by relative density, based on the principle that molecules settle down under a centrifugal force until they reach a medium with the density the same as theirs. The degree of separation or number of layers depends on the solution or gel. Differential centrifugation, on the other hand, does not utilize a density gradient, and the centrifugation is taken in increasing speeds. The different centrifugation speeds often create separation into not more than two fractions, so the supernatant can be separated further in additional centrifugation steps. For that, each step the centrifugation speed has to be increased until the desired particles are separated. In contrast, the density gradient centrifugation is usually performed with just one centrifugation speed.

<doc id="512770" wikidata="Q1124603" url="?curid=512770" title="James F. Wilson">
<text>James Falconer &quot;Jefferson Jim&quot; Wilson (October 19, 1828April 22, 1895) was an American lawyer and politician. He served as a Republican U.S. Congressman from Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district during the American Civil War, and later as a two-term U.S. Senator from Iowa. He was a pioneer in the advancement of federal protection for civil rights.

While in the United States House of Representatives, he had prominently opposed the 1867 effort to impeach President Andrew Johnson. However, he voted for the subsequent 1868 impeachment of Johnson, and served as a manager (prosecutor) during Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial.

In the last half of the nineteenth century, two unrelated Iowans named James Wilson achieved high office, necessitating an early form of disambiguation. Representative and Senator James F. Wilson (of Jefferson County, Iowa) became known as &quot;Jefferson Jim&quot; Wilson, while Representative and Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson (of Tama County, Iowa) became known as &quot;Tama Jim&quot; Wilson.

==Personal background==
Wilson was born in Newark, Ohio. After his father died when James was eleven, James needed to work from an early age, and attended school when work permitted. After serving as a harnessmaker&#x27;s apprentice, he studied law in Newark alongside future U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Burnham Woods. He was admitted to the bar in 1851 and practiced in Newark until 1853.

In 1853, he moved to Fairfield, Iowa, where he resumed the practice of law. Three years later in 1856 amidst the 1856 United States presidential election, Wilson ran for and was elected to serve as a delegate to the Convention for the Revision of the Constitution of Iowa. The following year he was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives, where he served in the Ways and Means Committee.

During his early career, Wilson&#x27;s opposition towards slavery led him to join the Free Soil Party.

Wilson played an important role in the formation of the Iowa Republican Party, and antebellum Iowa government. In 1857, he was a delegate to Iowa&#x27;s constitutional convention, and served as a Republican in the Iowa House of Representatives that year and in 1859, when he was elected to the Iowa Senate. He served on the Committee of the Judiciary, and later served as a delegate to the 1860 Republican National Convention which nominated Abraham Lincoln of Illinois and Hannibal Hamlin of Maine to head the party ticket for the presidential election.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1860, Wilson and three others, including incumbent Samuel R. Curtis, vied for the Republican nomination to represent Iowa&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. Curtis won the nomination, then the general election. After the outbreak of the Civil War, however, Curtis resigned to accept appointment as an officer of the Union Army. At the convention called to choose the Republican nominee to succeed Curtis, &quot;it was a foregone conclusion that James F. Wilson would be the unanimous choice.&quot; In October 1861 Wilson was elected to fill the vacancy, easily defeating Democrat Jairus Edward Neal.

After completing Curtis&#x27;s term in the 37th Congress, he was re-elected three times, serving in the 38th, 39th, and 40th Congresses. He was chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary during the tumultuous periods during the War and Reconstruction.

Rep. Wilson&#x27;s first action in Congress was introducing a resolution prohibiting fugitive slaves from being returned to the South and ordering the dismissal of any military officer that instructs troops to do such, which was enacted. He in addition reported legislation which enfranchised blacks in Washington, D.C., as well as shepherding a bill that granted freedom to the family of black soldiers.

A business lawyer, Wilson advocated moderating the income tax among lower brackets and &quot;reasonable&quot; levels of protectionism. He also backed railroad grants and the Homestead Act, though opposed the Morrill College Land-Grant Act. Along with other Radical Republicans, Wilson adamantly supported a military occupation of the South during Reconstruction on the grounds that it was the only effective means of ensuring security.

Wilson was aligned with the faction of his Party known at the time as the &quot;Radical Republicans.&quot; He supported civil rights moves and objected to President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s attempts to veto the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Acts. His speech refuting arguments that lamented of the 1866 bill&#x27;s alleged unconstitutionality were remarked by James G. Blaine as having:
He supported the first bill in Congress to provide voting rights to black citizens of the District of Columbia. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1868, explaining prior to the district convention that with the election of an acceptable Republican president guaranteed and a change in administration inevitable, a change in representation of the First District was also timely. In all, Wilson served in the House from October 8, 1861, to March 4, 1869.

=== 1867 impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson ===
Wilson voted in support of launching the 1867 impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson. The vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry was largely seen as a means for Republicans to voice their displeasure with Johnson without actually going so far as to impeach him. Many Republicans fully expected that the House Committee on the Judiciary, which would oversee the inquiry, would not recommend impeachment, and that the prospect of impeachment would die quietly in the committee.

At the time of the inquiry, Wilson was the chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary. During the inquiry, Wilson opposed impeaching Johnson, publicly arguing that there were no proven legal grounds that an impeachment could justifiably be based upon. As a member of the committee, Wilson voted against recommending impeachment. However, on November 25, 1867, the committee voted 5–4 in support of recommending impeachment. Wilson wrote one of the committee&#x27;s minority reports against impeachment. In his minority report, Wilson argued that, while Johnson, &quot;deserves the censure and condemnation of every well-disposed citizen,&quot; the Congress should wait and let Americans remove Johnson from office in the 1868 presidential election. His minority report declared that Johnson, &quot;has disappointed the hopes and expectations of those who placed him in power. He had betrayed their confidence and joined hands with their enemies.&quot; However, in arguing against impeachment, it declared, &quot;the day of political impeachments would be a sad one for this country.&quot;

When the full House of Representatives subsequently voted on whether to impeach President Johnson, on December 7, 1867, he presented the argument against impeachment after George S. Boutwell made the case in support of impeachment. Wilson argued that while Johnson was the &quot;worst of presidents&quot;, his opposition to the positions of the Republican Party was not itself illegal. He argued that, despite Boutwell&#x27;s assertions that it did, the House did not have lone authority to determine what constitutes an &quot;impeachable offense&quot;. Wilson warned the that a broad interpretation of impeachment powers, as Boutwell championed, in theory could allow the House to effectively dictate the policy of presidents. He spent half of his speech arguing that impeachment was only reserved for indictable crimes, and half attacking those who opposed this position. Wilson characterized Boutwell as having effectively argued that the House should be allowed to impeach Johnson for something he &quot;could&quot; do, rather than some thing he &quot;had done&quot;. Wilson argued, &quot;this would lead us even beyond the conscience of this house.&quot; In his closing remarks, Wilson asked, &quot;if we cannot arraign the president for a specific crime, for what are we to proceed against him?&quot; After Wilson delivered his argument against impeachment were presented, the House voted proceeded to hold a vote in which it strongly voted against impeachment.

=== 1868 impeachment of Andrew Johnson ===
On January 27, 1868, Wilson voted in support of launching the second impeachment inquiry against Andrew Johnson.

Despite his initial misgivings on impeachment, after Johnson attempted to dismiss and replace of Edwin Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office Act, Wilson voted to impeach President Johnson on February 24, 1868, when the House successfully voted to impeach him. Before the vote, Wilson expressed an opinion representative of those expressed during debate by many Republicans that had previously voted against the impeachment resolution brought by the Judiciary Committee at the close of the 1867 impeachment inquiry against Johnson, declaring that, Wilson opined that in the previous impeachment vote, Johnson had not committed any action that was a crime under either common law or statute. Wilson declared that Johnson had mistakenly been emboldened after he was not impeached in December 1867 and had proceeded to commit an act that constituted clear impeachable conduct, declaring, 

Wilson was afterwards appointed as a member of the seven-member committee that was tasked with writing articles of impeachment. When the House voted on specific articles of impeachment in early March, Wilson voted for all but one of the eleven articles, being one of twelve members of the Republican Party to vote against the tenth article of impeachment (which had been written by Benjamin Butler independent from the seven-member committee). Wilson was elected one of the seven House managers (prosecutors) for impeachment trial of President Johnson. During the trial, Wilson sparred with Maine senator William P. Fessenden, who claimed that he broke from &quot;his usual discretion.&quot;

==Government director of the Pacific Railroad==
President Ulysses S. Grant offered Wilson the post of Secretary of State, but Wilson declined it, serving instead as government director of the Pacific Railroad for eight years.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1882, the Iowa General Assembly elected Wilson to the U.S. Senate. His first initiative as a U.S. Senator was to propose an unsuccessful constitutional amendment to more explicitly authorize the federal government to adopt laws that protect civil rights from violations by private citizens, to nullify the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling two months earlier in the &quot;Civil Rights Cases,&quot; 109 U.S. 3 (1883). The General Assembly re-elected him in 1888 to a second six-year term. In the Senate, Wilson served as chairman of the Committee of Mines and Mining (in the Forty-eighth Congress), Committee on Expenditures of Public Money (in the Forty-eighth Congress), Committee on Revision of the Laws of the United States (in the Forty-ninth through Fifty-second Congresses), and the Committee on Education and Labor (in the Fifty-second Congress).

In the Senate, Wilson was known as a staunch supporter of the Prohibition cause, being a member of the Sons of Temperance. He was particularly outspoken on the issue, advocating in 1883 to commit the GOP state convention in Iowa to the issue.

In 1890, Wilson was one of three Senators mentioned as potential nominees to fill the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Samuel F. Miller of Iowa. President Benjamin Harrison instead picked Michigan judge Henry Billings Brown, who would later write the Supreme Court&#x27;s opinion upholding &quot;separate but equal&quot; racial segregation in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson, &quot;163 U.S. 537 (1896).

==Death==
Wilson died in Fairfield shortly after his second Senate term ended. In its obituary, the &quot;New York Times&quot; attributed his death to &quot;paralysis of the brain&quot;, and stated that his death had been expected. He was interred in Fairfield-Evergreen Cemetery.

<text>Rottal-Inn is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the southeastern part of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the south clockwise) Altötting, Mühldorf, Landshut, Dingolfing-Landau and Passau. To the southeast is the Austrian state of Upper Austria (Braunau).

==Geography==
The main rivers in the district are the Inn and its tributary, the Rott.

==History==
The district was created in 1972 by merging the two previous districts of Pfarrkirchen and Eggenfelden and parts of the districts Griesbach and Vilsbiburg.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combines the symbols of the two previous districts. Dexter in chief is a panther as the symbol of Eggenfelden, derived from the coat of arms of the Counts of Spanheim, who ruled the area until the 13th century. Sinister in base a horse as the symbol of Pfarrkirchen, as the area is famous for the horse-breeding tradition. The bendlet sinister Azure between them symbolizes the two rivers in the district, the Inn and the Rott.

<text>Drohobych (, ; ; ) is a city in the south of Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. It is the administrative center of Drohobych Raion and hosts the administration of Drohobych urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. In 1939–1941 and 1944–1959 it was the center of Drohobych Oblast.

Drohobych was founded at the end of the eleventh century as an important trading post and transport node between Kievan Rus&#x27; and the lands to the West of Rus&#x27;. After extinction of the local Ruthenian dynasty and subsequent incorporation of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia into the Polish Kingdom by 1349, from the fifteenth century the city developed as a mercantile and saltworks centre. Drohobych became part of the Habsburg Empire in 1772 after the first partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the mid-nineteenth century it became Europe&#x27;s largest oil extraction center, which significantly contributed to its rapid development. In the renascent, interwar Poland it was the center of a county within the Lwów Voivodeship. As an outcome of World War II, the city was incorporated into the Ukrainian part of the Soviet Union, which in 1991 became the independent Ukraine.

The city was the birthplace of such well-known personalities as Elisabeth Bergner, Yuriy Drohobych (Kotermak), Ivan Franko and Bruno Schulz. The city has several oil refineries. The Drohobych saltworks are considered to be the oldest in Europe. The estimated population of Drohobych is , making it the second largest city in Lviv Oblast.

==History==

While there are only legendary accounts of it, Drohobych probably existed in the Kievan Rus&#x27; period. According to a legend, there was a settlement, called &quot;Bych&quot;, of salt-traders. When Bych was destroyed in a Cumanian raid, survivors rebuilt the settlement in a nearby location under its current name which means a &quot;Second Bych&quot;. In the time of Kievan Rus&#x27;, the Tustan fortress was built near Drohobych. However, scholars perceive this legend with skepticism, pointing out that Drohobych is a Polish pronunciation of Dorogobuzh, a common East Slavic toponym applied to three different towns in Kievan Rus&#x27;.

The city was first mentioned in 1387 in the municipal records of Lviv, in connection with a man named Martin (or Marcin) of &quot;Drohobych&quot;. Furthermore, the same chronicler&#x27;s &quot;List of all Ruthenian cities, the farther and the near ones&quot; in Voskresensky Chronicle (dated 1377–82) mentions &quot;(Druhabets&#x27;)&quot; among other cities in Volhynia that existed at the same time such as (&quot;Kholm&quot;), (&quot;Lviv the Great&quot;).

In 1392 Polish king Vladislav II ordered the construction of the first Roman Catholic municipal parish church (), using the foundations of older Ruthenian buildings. In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city was the center of large rural starostvo (county within the Ruthenian Voivodeship).

Drohobych received Magdeburg rights some time in the 15th century (sources differ as to the exact year, some giving 1422 or 1460, or 1496 but in 1506 the rights were confirmed by King Alexander the Jagiellonian). The salt industry was significant in the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries.

From the early seventeenth century, a Ukrainian Catholic brotherhood existed in the city. In 1648, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the Cossacks stormed the city and its cathedral. Most of the local Poles, as well as the Greek Catholics and the Jews, were murdered at the time, while some managed to survive in the Bell tower not taken in the raid. The 1772 partition of Poland gave the city to the Habsburg monarchy. In the 19th century, significant oil resources were discovered in the area, making the city an important center of the oil and natural gas industries.

After World War I, the area became part of the short-lived independent West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (ZUNR). The ZUNR was taken over by the Second Polish Republic after the Polish–Ukrainian War and Drohobych became part of the Lwów Voivodeship in 1919. In 1928 the still extant Ukrainian private gymnasium (academically oriented secondary school) opened in the center of the city. The population reached some 40,000 in the late 1920s, and its oil refinery at Polmin became one of the biggest in Europe, employing 800 people. Numerous visitors came there to view the wooden Greek Catholic churches, among them the Church of St. Yur, which was regarded as the most beautiful such construction in the Second Polish Republic, with frescoes from 1691. Drohobych was also a major sports center (see: Junak Drohobycz).

In September 1939, after the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and according to the Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement, the city was annexed to Soviet Ukraine. After the invasion Nazi Germany wanted to incorporate the city into its General Government due to its oil fields, but the USSR refused and annexed it. In Soviet Ukraine, Drohobych became the center of the Drohobych Oblast (region). Its local Polish boy scouts created the White Couriers organization, which in late 1939 and early 1940 smuggled hundreds of people from the Soviet Union to Hungary across the Soviet-Hungarian border in the Carpathian Mountains. In early July 1941, during the first weeks of the Nazi invasion of the USSR, the city was occupied by Nazi Germany.

Pre-war Drohobych had a significant Jewish community of about 15,000 people, 40% of the total population. Immediately after the Germans entered the city, Ukrainian nationalists started a pogrom which lasted for three days, supported by the Wehrmacht. During 1942 there were several selections, deportations, and murders in the streets, again led by German troops and Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. In October 1942, Drohobych ghetto was established with approximately 10,000 prisoners, including Jews brought from neighboring localities. In June 1943, the German administration and troops liquidated the ghetto. Only 800 Jews from Drohobych survived. On 6 August 1944, the German occupation ended and the Red Army entered the city. Despite the large Jewish population prior to the war, a current resident has stated that he was one of only two Jews who came back to his village to live after 1945. After the war, the city remained an oblast center until the Drohobych Oblast was incorporated into the Lviv Oblast in 1959. In Soviet times, Drohobych became an important industrial center of Western Ukraine, with highly developed oil-refining, machine building, woodworking, food, and light industries.

Until 18 July 2020, Drohobych was designated as a city of oblast significance and belonged to Drohobych Municipality but not to Drohobych Raion, even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine which reduced the number of raions of Lviv Oblast to seven, Drohobych Municipality was merged into Drohobych Raion.

<text>Sabicas (proper name: Agustín Castellón Campos) (16 March 1912 – 14 April 1990) was a Spanish flamenco guitarist of Romani origin.

==Biography==
Sabicas was born in Pamplona, Spain, and began playing guitar at the age of five and made his performing debut two years later. His early style was influenced by Ramón Montoya, to whom he was related on his mother&#x27;s side of the family. Extensive collaboration with important &quot;cantaores&quot; (male flamenco singers) of the period helped him develop his personal style.

Leaving Spain in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, he went into exile in Latin America with &quot;bailaora&quot; (dancer) Carmen Amaya. He lived in Mexico City, married Esperanza González Erazo and had four children of the marriage: Maricruz 1944, Carlos 1946, Agustine 1952 and Margaret 1956. Agustine and Margaret live in New York City, Maricruz is deceased, and Carlos is deceased. Amaya and Sabicas toured together several times. Sabicas later settled in New York City in the United States where he formed a life-long friendship and business association with classical guitarist Rolando Valdés-Blain. He did not return to his native Spain until 1967.

Sabicas was instrumental in the introduction of flamenco to audiences outside of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world. He was probably best known for his technical skills: blazingly fast &quot;picados&quot; (scales), fast arpeggios, quality composition for the many forms of flamenco, and infallible rhythm, which was critical when playing with a dancer. He was also considered to have perfect pitch. &quot;The finest technique around has got to be Sabicas, the flamenco player,&quot; Chet Atkins told &quot;Guitar Player Magazine&quot; in March 1972.

Sabicas was one of flamenco&#x27;s greatest guitarists, not only as a technician, but also as a composer. He played flamenco at a previously unimaginable level and created new techniques, opening up new possibilities for the solo instrument. He brought his art to concert halls and major theaters, making it available to all classes. Modern players such as Paco de Lucía, Paco Pena, Tomatito, Serranito, René Heredia, Juan Manuel Cañizares, El Viejín, Vicente Amigo, Gerardo Núñez, Javier Conde and many more acknowledge the great influence of Sabicas&#x27;s music.

Sabicas died at the age of 78 at a hospital in New York, New York, of complications from pneumonia and multiple strokes.

<text>Ken Lawrence is a nerdcore rapper who purports to be the late theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking rapping under the name MC Hawking.

MC Hawking rose to popularity on the Internet in the early 2000s. The songs were originally released in MP3 format, but due to the popularity of the website Lawrence was signed to a record deal with Brash Music to release a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album in 2004.

== Background ==
MC Hawking&#x27;s entire body of work and his rapper persona were created by American web developer Ken Lawrence. Lawrence earned a degree in music composition from Hampshire College. His raps are synthesized by the text-to-speech program WillowTalk. The beats for MC Hawking are provided by DJ Doomsday (another alter-ego of Ken Lawrence). The beats are a combination of samples of classic hip hop tracks, commercial royalty-free loop libraries, live performances, and midi compositions.

===Lyrical content===
The lyrics are a mixture of gangsta rap topics, science topics and Stephen Hawking quotations (such as the famous &quot;When I hear of Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, I reach for my gun&quot;, which became &quot;Every time I think of them my trigger finger itches&quot;, referring to creationists). Among subjects of MC Hawking songs are various scientific topics and Hawking&#x27;s professional relationships with MIT rivals, as well as the standard fare of gangsta rap, including street violence and drug use.

The lyrics display insight into many aspects of current scientific thought, Newton&#x27;s laws of motion (&quot;All My Shootings Be Drivebys&quot;), Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity (&quot;E=MC Hawking&quot;), the Big Bang (&quot;The Big Bizang&quot;), Thermodynamics (&quot;Entropy&quot;), and quantum physics subjects such as Schrödinger&#x27;s cat and the wave function collapse (&quot;Rock Out With Your Hawk Out&quot;).

The creation evolution controversy is also mentioned in &quot;Fuck the Creationists&quot; and &quot;Entropy&quot;.

===Dark Matter and greatest hits album===
He is also involved with a heavy metal group called Dark Matter — a parody of Ice-T&#x27;s &quot;Body Count&quot; — with whom he has performed such songs as &quot;Why Won&#x27;t Jesse Helms Just Hurry Up and Die&quot;, &quot;UFT for the MC&quot; (a parody of the Sex Pistols song &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;), and &quot;The Big Bizang&quot;. He is also an occasional Song Fight! participant.

His &quot;greatest hits&quot; album is called &quot;A Brief History of Rhyme: MC Hawking&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, a parody of Hawking&#x27;s book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;. It included many songs that were available on the official website, plus new material (four songs and three interludes from a fictional radio interview).

===Reaction by Stephen Hawking===
Stephen Hawking said in 2000 that he was &quot;flattered, as it&#x27;s a modern-day equivalent to &quot;Spitting Image&quot;&quot;. On the inside cover of &quot;A Brief History of Rhyme&quot;, Lawrence thanks Stephen Hawking &quot;for taking this joke in the spirit that it was intended.&quot;

===MC Hawking&#x27;s Podcore Nerdcast===

In 2013, Lawrence, along with longtime collaborators Len Pal and the voice actor Dave B. Mitchell, launched &quot;MC Hawking&#x27;s Podcore Nerdcast&quot;, a podcast in which the hosts discuss movies, games, books, and music (and particularly nerdcore hip hop). as well as interviews with nerdcore musicians including MC Frontalot, MC Lars, Random, and Atheist (Scott Knopf). In June 2014, Cassie joined the cast to fill in for Mitchell (due to scheduling conflicts). Regular features include &quot;Will It Suck&quot;, in which the hosts discuss upcoming films and predict opening weekend box office and Rotten Tomatoes results, &quot;Dino News&quot;, in which Cassie brings the latest news about dinosaurs, &quot;Nerds Need to Know&quot;, which highlights books, movies, or television shows relevant to nerd culture, and &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot;, in which the hosts debate potential new laws or decrees that could make the world a better place. Episodes occasionally also feature new MC Hawking tracks. The podcast has been inactive since 2018.

===Upcoming second album===

His second album, &quot;The Hawkman Returneth&quot;, was due for release in 2018, announced with the release of the single &quot;Fear of a Black Hole&quot;, which was first performed in 2016 in front of the real Stephen Hawking and others including Richard Dawkins and Brian May. As of 2023, no additional music has been released.
