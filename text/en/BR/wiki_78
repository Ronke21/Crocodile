<doc id="528226" wikidata="Q611027" url="?curid=528226" title="Castellammarese War">
<text>The Castellammarese War () was a bloody power struggle for control of the American Mafia between partisans of Joe &quot;The Boss&quot; Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano that took place in New York City from February 26, 1930, until April 15, 1931. The feud was named after the Sicilian town of Castellammare del Golfo, Maranzano&#x27;s birthplace. 

Maranzano&#x27;s faction prevailed in the conflict and divided New York&#x27;s crime families into the Five Families; Maranzano declared himself &quot;capo di tutti i capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). However, Maranzano was murdered in September 1931 on orders of Lucky Luciano, who established a power-sharing arrangement through a governing body called the Commission, giving equal stature to all Mafia families to avoid such feuds in the future.

==Background==
In the 1920s, Mafia operations in the United States were controlled by Giuseppe &quot;Joe The Boss&quot; Masseria, whose faction consisted mainly of gangsters from Sicily, Calabria (the &#x27;Ndrangheta) and Campania (the Camorra) in southern Italy. Masseria&#x27;s faction included Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Albert &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia, Vito Genovese, Alfred Mineo, Willie Moretti, Joe Adonis and Frank Costello. 

However, powerful Sicilian Don Vito Ferro decided to make a bid for control of Mafia operations, sending Salvatore Maranzano from his base in Castellammare del Golfo to seize control. The Castellammarese faction in the U.S. included Joseph &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; Bonanno, Stefano &quot;The Undertaker&quot; Magaddino, Joseph Profaci and Joe Aiello. As it became more and more evident that the two factions would clash for leadership of the Mafia, they each sought to recruit more followers to support them.

Outwardly, the Castellammarese War was between the forces of Masseria and Maranzano. Underneath, however, there was also a generational conflict between the old guard Sicilian leadership known as the &quot;Mustache Petes&quot; for their long mustaches and old-world ways, such as refusing to do business with non-Italians and the &quot;Young Turks&quot;, a younger and more diverse Italian-American group who, unlike the &quot;Mustache Petes&quot;, had grown up in the U.S., were more forward-thinking and were willing to work with non-Italians. This approach led Masseria&#x27;s followers to question whether he was capable of making the Mafia prosper in the world of the 1930s. Led by Luciano, the aim of this group was to end the feud as soon as possible in order to resume their businesses, viewing the conflict as unnecessary. 

Luciano&#x27;s objective was to modernize the mob and do away with unnecessary orthodox norms. This was a vision that enabled Luciano to attract followers, who had seen the inadequacies of Masseria&#x27;s traditionalist leadership. Therefore, both factions were fluid, with many mobsters switching sides or killing their own allies during the feud. Tensions between the Masseria and Maranzano factions were evident as far back as 1928, with one side frequently hijacking the other&#x27;s alcohol trucks (alcohol production being illegal in the U.S. at that time due to Prohibition).

==Hostilities begin==
As the feud became more violent, gunmen clashed on the streets of New York City. According to Bonanno, in February 1930 Masseria ordered the death of Gaspar Milazzo, a Castellemmarese native who was the president of Detroit&#x27;s chapter of . Masseria had reportedly been humiliated by Milazzo&#x27;s refusal to support him in a dispute involving the Chicago Outfit and Al Capone.

The opening salvo in the feud was fired within the Masseria faction when, on February 26, 1930, Masseria ordered the murder of an ally, Gaetano Reina. Masseria gave the job to a young Genovese, who killed Reina with a shotgun. Masseria&#x27;s intent was to protect his secret allies Tommy Gagliano, Tommy Lucchese and Dominick &quot;The Gap&quot; Petrilli. Later his treachery would come back to haunt him, as the Reina family then threw its support behind Maranzano. Vito Bonventre also became a target, as Castellammarese-born members of Nicolo Schiro&#x27;s gang began to threaten Masseria&#x27;s domination over Mafia gangs. Masseria forced Schiro to pay him US$10,000 (approximately US$170,000 in 2022) and step down as boss of the gang. On July 15, 1930, Bonventre was gunned down outside his garage.

==Trading blows==
On August 15, 1930, Castellammerese loyalists executed a key Masseria enforcer, Giuseppe Morello, at Morello&#x27;s East Harlem office (a visitor, Giuseppe Peraino, was also killed). Two weeks later, Masseria suffered another blow. After Reina&#x27;s murder, Masseria had appointed Joseph Pinzolo to take over the ice-distribution racket. However, on September 9, the Reina family shot and killed Pinzolo at a Times Square office rented by Lucchese. After these two murders, the Reina crew formally joined forces with the Castellammarese.

Masseria soon struck back. On October 23, 1930, Castellammarese ally Joe Aiello, president of the Chicago Unione Siciliane, was murdered in Chicago.

==The tide turns==
Following the murder of Aiello, the tide of feud rapidly turned in favor of the Castellammarese. On November 5, 1930, Mineo and a key member of Masseria&#x27;s gang, Steve Ferrigno, were murdered. Francesco Scalice inherited control of Mineo&#x27;s gang and subsequently defected to the Maranzano faction. At this point, many other members of Masseria&#x27;s gang also began defecting to Maranzano, rendering the original battle lines of the conflict (Castellammarese &quot;versus&quot; non-Castellammarese) meaningless. On February 3, 1931, another important Masseria lieutenant, Joseph Catania, was gunned down, dying two days later.

Given the worsened situation, Masseria allies Luciano and Genovese started communicating with Castellammarese leader Maranzano. The two men agreed to betray Masseria if Maranzano would end the feud. A deal was struck, based on which Luciano would arrange for Masseria to be murdered and Maranzano would bring the Castellammarese War to an end. On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a restaurant in Coney Island, Brooklyn. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Anastasia, Genovese, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel; Ciro &quot;The Artichoke King&quot; Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver&#x27;s seat by Siegel.

However, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[A]fter that, the police have been unable to learn definitely [what happened]&quot;. Reputedly Masseria was &quot;seated at a table playing cards with two or three unknown men&quot; when he was fired upon from behind. He died from gunshot wounds to his head, back, and chest. Masseria&#x27;s autopsy report shows that he died on an empty stomach. No witnesses came forward, though &quot;two or three&quot; men were observed leaving the restaurant and getting into a stolen car. No one was convicted in Masseria&#x27;s murder as there were no witnesses and Luciano had an alibi.

==The new Mafia structure==
With the death of Masseria, the feud ended. Maranzano organized the Mafia in New York City using a clear structure and hierarchy by dividing the main Italian gangs in New York into Five Families. Each family had a boss, underboss, consigliere, capos, soldiers, and associates. While associates could come from any background, the higher ranks had to be &quot;made men&quot;, required in most eras to be full-blooded Italian Americans. Shortly after Masseria&#x27;s death, Maranzano announced that the Five Families would be led by Luciano, Joe Bonanno, Joseph Profaci, Vincent Mangano and Thomas Gagliano.

Except for New York City, the major urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest were organized into one family per city by Maranzano; due to the size of organized crime in New York, it was organized into five separate families. The bosses of the Five Families of New York were to be Luciano (now the Genovese crime family), Profaci (now the Colombo crime family), Gagliano (now the Lucchese crime family), Maranzano (now the Bonanno crime family), and Frank Scalice (now the Gambino crime family). Maranzano called a meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;).

Each crime &quot;family&quot; was to be headed by a &quot;boss&quot;, who was assisted by an &quot;underboss&quot; (the third-ranking position of &quot;consigliere&quot; was added somewhat later). Below the underboss, the family was divided into crews, each headed by a &quot;caporegime&quot;, or &quot;capo&quot;, and staffed by &quot;soldiers&quot;. The soldiers would often be assisted by associates, who were not yet members. Associates could also include non-Italians who worked with the family, and would include Meyer Lansky and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel.

==Death of Maranzano==
Maranzano&#x27;s reign as &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; was short-lived. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that Maranzano was even greedier and more hidebound than Masseria had been. On September 10, 1931, he was shot and stabbed to death in his Manhattan office by a team of Jewish triggermen (recruited by Lansky), which included Samuel &quot;Red&quot; Levine, Bo Weinberg, and Bugsy Siegel.

With both Maranzano and Masseria out of the way, it was easier for the Young Turks, led by Luciano, to assume control of the way things functioned in New York City. The first agenda on the table was the reformation and restructuring of the American Mafia. Luciano envisioned the future of the American Mafia in the form of a major corporation. He believed that this would increase cooperation, reduce conflict and ensure plain sailing governance by the Mafia as a whole. Since Maranzano had formed a basic structure that was in the process of being put into effect, Luciano decided to retain the concept to a large extent. Owing to his clear disregard for orthodox ideologies that did not have any profitable consequences, Luciano allowed for more flexibility in the structure, allowing for the inclusion of other societal groups like the Jews to involve themselves with the families. In Joe Bonanno&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Man of Honor&quot;, he states: &quot;We revised the old custom of looking toward one man, one supreme leader for advice and the settling of disputes. We replaced leadership by one man with leadership by committee. We opted for a parliamentary arrangement whereby a group of the most important men in our world would assume the function formerly performed by one man.&quot;

In the aftermath of the Maranzano hit, there was believed to have been a massive purge of &quot;old-timer&quot; mafiosi, the so-called &quot;Night of the Sicilian Vespers&quot;. These rumors were seemingly confirmed by the testimony of Joseph Valachi, but a later study found no signs of such massive violence occurring. Luciano formed &quot;The Commission&quot; to oversee all Mafia activities in the United States and serve to mediate conflicts between families, eliminating the &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; position.

In the end, both of the traditional factions in the New York Mafia lost the feud. The real winners were the younger and more ruthless generation of mobsters, headed by Luciano. With their ascension to power, organized crime was poised to expand into a truly national and multi-ethnic combination.

==Popular culture==
* The 1981 movie &quot;Gangster Wars&quot; and the 1991 &quot;Mobsters&quot; are partly fictionalized accounts of the Castellammarese War, while 1981&#x27;s &quot;The Gangster Chronicles&quot; TV miniseries covers the feud over a few of its thirteen episodes. All of these cover events from the point of view of Luciano. 
* Events from the feud (most notably the assassination of Maranzano) are fictionalized in Mario Puzo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Godfather&quot;.
* The 1973 Charles Bronson movie &quot;The Stone Killer&quot; is a fictionalized story of a complicated plot to assassinate the heads of organized crime families using Vietnam veterans. The plot is the brainchild of an elderly mafioso who has been obsessed since 1931 with avenging the &quot;Night of the Sicilian Vespers&quot; murders, supposedly orchestrated by Lucky Luciano.
* The feud is one of the main plot elements of the final season of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;.
* AMC&#x27;s &quot;The Making of the Mob: New York&quot; also covers the feud.

<text>Frank Williams Hunt (December 16, 1861 – November 25, 1906) was the fifth governor of Idaho from 1901 until 1903.

==Biography==
Hunt was educated in the common schools of Louisville, Kentucky. He moved to Idaho, pursued work as a miner, and was married to Ruth Maynard on November 10, 1896.

==Career==
Elected to the Idaho State House of Representatives in 1892, Hunt held that position until 1894. Hunt served as a captain in the Idaho Regiment of Volunteers in the Philippines during the Spanish–American War (1898).

Elected governor in 1900 at the age of 38 Hunt remains the youngest governor in Idaho history. In March 1901 Hunt signed legislation creating the Academy of Idaho (now Idaho State University) in Pocatello. Hunt also ended the state of martial law in northern Idaho enacted by his predecessor, Frank Steunenberg, in 1899 as a response to labor unrest.

Hunt was defeated for reelection in 1902 by Republican John T. Morrison. After leaving office he became vice president and general manager of Dewey Combination Lease Company.

==Death==
Late in 1906 Hunt contracted pneumonia in Goldfield, Nevada and died on November 25, in Boise, Idaho, at the age of 44. He is buried in the Boise Pioneer Cemetery (which has become known as &quot;The Masonic Cemetery&quot;). The Gem County Museum in Emmett includes an exhibit of his belongings.

<text>David Ariu Christopher, also known as Kariamakin Airu Christopher (died 26 February 2022) was a politician of Banaban descent, who has held office in two countries — Fiji and Kiribati.

Christopher was educated at Niusawa Primary School, Queen Victoria School, Lelean Memorial School and then the University of the South Pacific. He worked for the Fiji Sugar Corporation, and then for Rabi Holdings, the investment company of the Rabi Council of Leaders. He was appointed to the Kiribati House of Assembly in 1994, serving a term of four years as representative of the Banaban people living on Rabi Island in Fiji.

At the 2001 Fijian general election, he won the North Eastern General electorate for the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) of Laisenia Qarase, becoming the first Banaban elected to the House of Representatives of Fiji. He lost his seat to Robin Irwin at the 2006 election. Christopher&#x27;s former constituency was one of three reserved for &quot;General Electors&quot; - Fijian citizens who are not of ethnic Fijian, Indian, or Rotuman descent. Following the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état and the dissolution of the SDL he returned to work for the Rabi Council as executive director.

In 2016 Christopher was again appointed to fill the nominated seat for Rabi Island in the Kiribati House of Assembly. He was renominated at the 2020 Kiribati parliamentary election.

<text>The Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) is a public college under the State University of New York, in New York City. It focuses on art, business, design, mass communication, and technology connected to the fashion industry. It was founded in 1944.

==Academics==

Seventeen majors are offered through the School of Art and Design, and ten through the Jay and Patty Baker School of Business and Technology leading to degrees of Associate of Applied Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Bachelor of Science. The School of Liberal Arts offers a degree program of Bachelor of Science in art history and museum professions and a degree program of Bachelor of Science in film and media. The School of Graduate Studies offers seven programs leading to degrees of Master of Arts, Master of Fine Arts, or Master of Professional Studies.

In addition to the degree programs, FIT offers a wide selection of non-credit courses through the Center for Professional Studies. One of the most popular programs is the &quot;Sew Like a Pro&quot; series, which teaches basic through advanced sewing skills.

FIT is an accredited institutional member of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, and the Council for Interior Design Accreditation. FIT publishes research on store branding and store positioning. In 1967, FIT faculty and staff won the first higher education union contract in New York State. It is also a part of the Beta Theta Sigma chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, which has been active since 1999.

==Campus==
The nine-building campus in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan includes classrooms, television and radio studios, labs, design workshops, and multiple exhibition galleries.

The Conference Center at FIT features the John E. Reeves Great Hall, a space suitable for conferences, fashion shows, lectures, and other events. The campus also has two large theaters: the Haft Auditorium and the Katie Murphy Amphitheatre.

FIT serves more than 7,578 full-time and 2,186 part-time students. Four dormitories, three of which are on campus, serve approximately 2,300 students and offer a variety of accommodations. The George S. and Mariana Kaufman Residence Hall located at 406 West 31st Street—formerly a book bindery factory—was converted into residential apartments, to offer more housing near the campus for FIT students. The campus also has a retail food court/dining hall, a deli and a Starbucks.

=== Academic facilities ===
The Fred P. Pomerantz Art and Design Center offers facilities for design studies: photography studios with black-and-white darkrooms, painting rooms, a sculpture studio, a printmaking room, a graphics laboratory, display and exhibit design rooms, life-sketching rooms, and a model-making workshop. The Shirley Goodman Resource Center houses the Museum at FIT and the Library/Media Services, with references for history, sociology, technology, art, and literature; international journals and periodicals; sketchbooks and records donated by designers, manufacturers, and merchants; slides, tapes, and periodicals; and a clipping file. The Gladys Marcus Library provides access to books, periodicals, DVDs and non-print materials, and houses Fashion Institute of Technology Special Collections and College Archives. FIT also has many computer labs for student use. The Instructional Media Services Department provides audiovisual and TV support and an in-house TV studio. Student work is also displayed throughout the campus. Fashion shows featuring the work of graduating Bachelor of Fine Arts students occur each academic year.

The Design/Research Lighting Laboratory, a development facility for interior design and other academic disciplines, features 400 commercially available lighting fixtures controlled by a computer. The Annette Green/Fragrance Foundation Laboratory is an environment for the study of fragrance development.

== Museum at FIT ==
The Museum at FIT, founded in 1969 as the Design Laboratory, includes collections of clothing, textiles, and accessories.

It began presenting exhibitions in the 1970s, utilizing a collection on long-term loan from the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and then over time acquiring its own collection as well as thousands of textiles and other fashion-related material. In 1993, the Board of Trustees of FIT, noting the significance of the Design Laboratory&#x27;s collections and exhibitions, changed the institution&#x27;s name to The Museum at FIT. In 2012, the museum was awarded accreditation by the American Alliance of Museums.

The museum&#x27;s permanent collection now includes more than 50,000 garments and accessories from the 18th century to the present. Important designers such as Adrian, Balenciaga, Chanel, and Dior are represented. The collecting policy of the museum focuses on aesthetically and historically significant clothing, accessories, textiles and visual materials, with emphasis on contemporary avant-garde fashion.

There are three galleries in the museum. The lower level gallery is devoted to special exhibitions. The Fashion and Textile History Gallery on the main floor features a rotating selection of approximately 200 historically and artistically significant objects from the museum&#x27;s permanent collection. Gallery FIT, also located on the main floor, is dedicated to student and faculty exhibitions.

Past exhibitions include: &quot;London Fashion,&quot; which received the first Richard Martin Award for Excellence in Costume Exhibitions from The Costume Society of America, &quot;The Corset: Fashioning the Body,&quot; and &quot;Gothic: Dark Glamour.&quot; Other special exhibitions have included &quot;Isabel Toledo: Fashion From the Inside Out,&quot; in which the inauguration day ensemble Isabel Toledo designed for Michelle Obama in 2008 was on display, and a look at sustainable fashion with &quot;Eco-Fashion: Going Green,&quot; an exhibition from 2010 examining the past two centuries of fashion&#x27;s good—and bad—environmental and ethical practices.

More than 100,000 people visit the Museum at FIT each year, attending exhibitions, lectures, and other events. Admission is free to the public.

Fashion historian Valerie Steele became director of the Museum in 2003, and has also been named chief curator.

== Alumni ==

Well-known alumni of the school include the fashion designers Norma Kamali, Calvin Klein, Michael Kors (who did not complete his studies there), interior designer Scott Salvator, actress and comedian Janelle James, actress and LGBT advocate Laverne Cox and film director Joel Schumacher.

<text>Sunrise Over Sea is the third studio album by Australian band the John Butler Trio. It was released in March 2004.

== Conception and production ==

In late 2003, John Butler entered Woodstock Studios in Melbourne, which is owned by Joe Camilleri, the leader of Jo Jo Zep &amp; The Falcons and the Black Sorrows. He had a new band consisting of percussionist Nicky Bomba and upright-bass player Shannon Birchall. This would be Bomba&#x27;s only recording with the Trio (having returned to his own reggae band) until &quot;April Uprising&quot; (2010) The sound engineer for this production was Robin Mai.

John Butler told the Australian edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published in April 2004 that he wanted greater freedom to pursue his vision. &quot;Essentially what I learnt out of this process was, more so than ever, I&#x27;m the keeper of the music. I have the intuition and the foresight to pick the right players to my music. I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s not always about having the same players for five, six or 10 years, it’s having the right chemistry for these songs at this time. Some of my favourite Jimi Hendrix music is off-the-cuff stuff with Band of Gypsys.&quot;

The title &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot; is probably a reference to his home in Byron Bay, which is one of the most easterly points in Australia and therefore one of the first points to see the sunrise. It is also part of the lyrics to the song &quot;Peaches &amp; Cream.&quot;

All the songs on the album were written, arranged and produced by John Butler, except for &quot;What You Want&quot; where the string section was arranged by Shannon Birchall and John Butler and was scored and conducted by Shannon Birchall.

Additional musicians performing on the album include: Michael Barker – &quot;Treat Yo Mama&quot;, &quot;Company Sin&quot;, &quot;Bound To Ramble&quot;, Seeing Angels&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;ll Come a Time&quot;, &quot;Zebra&quot;; Danielle Caruna – &quot;Treat Yo Mama&quot;, &quot;Peaches &amp; Cream&quot;, &quot;What You Want&quot;, &quot;Sometime&quot;; Michael Caruna – &quot;Zebra&quot;; Dave Pensabene – &quot;Zebra&quot;; Tim Neil – &quot;Sometimes&quot;

Recent editions of the album have included the bonus track &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot;, which was released on an EP in 2004. It is a politically charged song that was very successful off the back of the recent LP.

In August 2004, a new disc, &quot;What You Want&quot; was released, with the song &quot;What You Want&quot; (Shared by Sunrise over Sea) and including a new version of the song &quot;Treat Yo&#x27; Mama&quot; and a cover of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number one in the Australian album charts on 15 March 2004 and achieved gold record status in its first week of release. &quot;Zebra&quot; was released in December 2003 and made the ARIA singles charts in early 2004. It was number 8 in the Triple J Hottest 100 for 2003 and also had significant airplay on commercial FM radio across Australia. This was the first fully independent album (independent label/independent distributor) to debut at number 1 on the Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) albums chart. In 2011, &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot; was certified five times platinum in Australia.

<text>The Legacy Virus is a fictional plague appearing in American comic books featuring the X-Men published by Marvel Comics. It first appeared in an eponymous storyline in Marvel Comics titles, from 1993 to 2001, during which it swept through the mutant population of the Marvel Universe, killing hundreds, as well as mutating so that it affected non-mutant humans as well.

==Description==
The Legacy Virus, contrary to the name, was a viroid and was released by Stryfe, a terrorist (and clone of Cable raised by Apocalypse) from approximately 2,000 years in the future. It originally existed in two forms, Legacy-1 and Legacy-2, but later mutated into a third form, Legacy-3; all were airborne agents.

Legacy-1 and Legacy-2 searched for a target organism&#x27;s &quot;X-factor,&quot; the sequence of mutant genes that gave a mutant their superpowers. If it did not find an activated X-factor in the target, the viroid would die off, leaving the person completely unaffected. If, however, it did detect the X-factor, it would begin inserting introns into the transcription codings of the victim&#x27;s mutant RNA, the process commonly being triggered after the patient used their powers for the first time after contracting the disease. The result was a major compromise of the replication and transcription process so disruptive that it eventually rendered the body incapable of creating healthy cells, ultimately resulting in the death of the victim. Prior to death, the viroid causes its host&#x27;s powers to flare out of control.

Legacy-1 attacked general transcription and replication of all cells, a messy and non-selective process that resulted in a condition akin to a fast-replicating cancer. This is the version that infected Illyana &quot;Magik&quot; Rasputin, sister of Piotr &quot;Colossus&quot; Rasputin.

Legacy-2 was much closer to Stryfe&#x27;s original template and more in tune with his desire to stir a species war between non-mutant humans and mutants. Its attacks were selective, working only on the X-factor genes. The net result was that a victim would eventually lose control of his superhuman powers. In addition to developing at a far slower rate than Legacy-1, victims of Legacy-2 developed skin lesions, fever, cough and overall weakness (symptoms displayed by the telepathic X-Man Revanche). The slow nature of Legacy-2 is why St. John &quot;Pyro&quot; Allerdyce survived for years following his initial infection.

Legacy-3 was accidentally created in the body of the mutant woman Infectia. Her powers allowed her to scan and visualize the genetic structure of a living being, then alter it according to her own whims. When Infectia was infected with the Legacy-2 Virus, her powers caused a replication error that removed the viroid&#x27;s conditioning to infect individuals only if the X-gene was present. Legacy-3 was capable of infecting any hominid.

The Legacy Virus is strongly suggested to be an allegory for the AIDS epidemic. Although all strains of the Legacy Virus were more dangerous than HIV, they shared similar symptoms such as skin lesions, fever, fatigue, and coughing. In addition, comics featuring the Legacy Virus illustrated the similar social impact of the further isolation of a stigmatized group.

==History==
The Legacy Virus first appeared in &quot;X-Force&quot; #18. It was based on a virus created by Apocalypse in the distant future, which was intended to kill the remaining non-mutants. At the time that this alternate version of Apocalypse was killed, the virus had not been perfected, and much like Legacy-3, it targeted all humans indiscriminately. As a result, this virus was never deployed, until Stryfe acquired it and altered it for his own purposes.

During the &quot;X-Cutioner&#x27;s Song&quot; crossover, the villain Stryfe gave Mister Sinister a canister that he claimed contained 2,000 years worth of genetic material from the Summers bloodline. When Gordon Lefferts, a scientist working for Sinister, opened the canister after Stryfe was apparently killed by Cable, they found nothing inside. Far worse than that, the canister actually contained a plague, Stryfe&#x27;s &quot;legacy&quot; to the world.

When Colossus&#x27; sister Illyana fell ill and died of the Legacy Virus in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #303 (Aug. 1993), he left the X-Men and joined Magneto&#x27;s Acolytes.

Eventually, reporter Trish Tilby, Beast&#x27;s former lover, reported to the general public the existence of the Legacy Virus. Later, Xavier and Beast call a press conference to assuage fears in the general populace. While watching the press conference, Moira MacTaggert has an insight that the virus worked as a &quot;designer gene&quot;.

The virus raged on for some time in the mutant population, until Mystique, in an effort to make the world safe for mutants, modified the virus to affect only humans. When Moira found out about this strain of the virus, she finally grasped what the key to the cure was. Unfortunately, she was mortally wounded by Mystique during the Brotherhood of Mutants&#x27; attack on Muir Island and did not live to complete the cure. Professor X did manage to telepathically retrieve the critical information before Moira died.

With this information, Beast was able to synthesize the cure a few weeks later, though one that had a price; the virus had first been released by the death of the first victim, and the release of the cure would have the same effect. Colossus, who did not want any more people to suffer his sister&#x27;s fate, snuck into McCoy&#x27;s lab and injected the cure into himself and activated his mutant powers, transforming his body into organic steel. This &quot;supercharged&quot; the Legacy cure, simultaneously killing him and stopping the spread of the Legacy virus, instantaneously curing even those dying of the virus at that moment (Although it was later revealed Colossus had been resurrected by alien technology and was being used as a test subject for an experimental formula that would reverse mutations before he was rescued by the X-Men).

Unfortunately, this rapid cure had unforeseen geopolitical effects. Thousands of Legacy-infected mutants had been quarantined on the island nation of Genosha, which was controlled by Magneto at the time. The instant cure gave Magneto a vast army overnight and allowed him to begin carrying out his plans for world conquest in the &quot;Eve of Destruction&quot; crossover.

In &quot;X-Factor&quot; vol. 3 #10, it was revealed that Singularity Investigations was creating a virus designed to kill mutants. While Jamie Madrox referred to this as the Legacy Virus, it is unclear whether Singularity is actually recreating Stryfe&#x27;s virus, creating what is to later be Stryfe&#x27;s virus, or merely engineering a new one with a similar purpose.

In &quot;X-Force&quot; #7, the Vanisher is seen to be in possession of a mutated strain of the Legacy Virus. It was later destroyed by Elixir in &quot;X-Force&quot; #10.

During the Skrull Invasion of Earth, Beast discovers that the Legacy Virus can infect Skrulls as well. Beast ponders whether to use it against the invading aliens. Cyclops decides to use it to get the Skrulls to surrender.

The Legacy Virus has returned once more as it turned out there were other samples that fell into the hands of Bastion. Samples have been injected into Beautiful Dreamer and Fever Pitch by the Leper Queen in order to cause their powers to go berserk and kill themselves and thousands of humans during an anti-mutant rally held by the Friends of Humanity. It was later revealed that Hellion and Surge were also injected with the Legacy Virus.

Dark Beast is also rumored to have a sample of the Legacy Virus.

==Infection list==
Listed below in alphabetical order are the characters infected by the Legacy Virus:
==Other versions==
The Ultimate Marvel universe version of the Legacy Virus is created by Nick Fury, in an attempt to replicate the Super Soldier experiment that created Captain America, using Beast&#x27;s blood. The virus turns normal humans into super-strong beings, but is fatal to mutants, prompting Fury to hold Beast in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody to coerce him to find a cure for it, in the event that there is ever an outbreak.

==In other media==

===Television===
* In &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot;, a variation of the Legacy Virus was used in a brief storyline where it was the creation of Apocalypse, who had created the virus with the aid of Graydon Creed and the Friends of Humanity, infecting innocent people and claiming that mutants were the ones who had caused the plague. In an attempt to stop the plague, Bishop came back from the future to destroy Apocalypse&#x27;s work before the virus could move on to mutants, but as a result vital antibodies that would allow the mutant race to survive future plagues were never created. Traveling back from even further in the future, Cable was able to come up with a compromise that allowed both Bishop&#x27;s and his own missions to succeed; although the plague never made the jump to mutants on a large-scale basis, Cable nevertheless ensured that Wolverine would be infected, thus creating the necessary antibodies while not killing any mutants thanks to Wolverine&#x27;s healing factor.

===Film===
* In &quot;Logan&quot;, a variation of the Legacy Virus is created by Zander Rice to wipe out the world&#x27;s mutant population to avenge his father&#x27;s death by Wolverine during the Weapon X program. By the year 2029, mutants are on the brink of extinction and Rice is working for Alkali-Transigen to engineer child mutants to be used as soldiers.

===Video games===
* In &quot;X-Men 2: Game Master&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, the game&#x27;s plot centers around the X-Men and the Legacy Virus.
* In the video game &quot;&quot;, a side mission includes saving a S.H.I.E.L.D. Omega Base Computer, which contains research data on the Legacy Virus. If the computer is saved, the data will be used to create a cure for the virus. If not, the Legacy Virus will become a plague that drives the mutant race nearly to extinction.

<doc id="528239" wikidata="Q465055" url="?curid=528239" title="Eastern Ghats">
<text>The Eastern Ghats is a mountain range that stretches along the eastern coast of the Indian peninsula. Covering an area of , it traverses the states of Odisha, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. The range forms a discontinuous chain of mountains along the eastern edge of the Deccan Plateau, stretching from north of the Mahanadi River in Odisha to Vaigai River in Tamil Nadu at the southern end of the Indian peninsula. The Eastern Ghats meet with the Western Ghats at Nilgiris. The average elevation is around and Arma Konda is the highest peak in the mountains at .

Geologic evidence indicates that the mountains were formed during the archeozoic era and became part of the Indian subcontinent post the break-up of the supercontinent of Rodinia and the formation of Gondwana. The mountains were formed through further metamorphism during the mid-Proterozoic era. The northern section of the range has an elevation ranging from and lies mostly in Odisha. The middle section stretches up to the Penna River and consists of two parallel ranges with an average elevation of . At the southern end, the range is made up of several smaller hills.

The Eastern Ghats forms a part of one of the major watersheds of India, consisting of many perennial river systems such as the Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi and Kaveri. Because of the higher elevation of the Deccan plateau on the west, most rivers originate from the Western Ghats and flow eastwards to cut across the range to the Bay of Bengal. As the mountains are discontinuous and have a lower elevation, they have a considerably lesser influence than the Western Ghats on the weather patterns in India. However, orography studies indicate that the range does play a role in bringing rainfall to the eastern coastal areas.

The weather is normally dry and humid with seasonal rainfall. There are nine different forest types found in the region including evergreen, deciduous and thorn forests. The Eastern Ghats region contains a large number of different species of flora and fauna, some of which are endemic to this region.

== Etymology ==
The name Eastern Ghats derives from the word ghat and the cardinal direction in which it is located with respect to the Indian mainland. &quot;Ghat&quot;, a term used in the Indian subcontinent, depending on the context, could either refer to a range of stepped hills such as the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, or a series of steps leading down to a body of water or wharf. As per linguist Thomas Burrow, the word &quot;Ghat&quot; was derived from similar words used in various Dravidian languages such as &quot;kattu&quot; (mountain side, ridge, or dam) in Tamil, &quot;katte&quot; (dam), &quot;gatta&quot; (mountain), and &quot;gatte&quot; (bank or shore) in Kannada, and &quot;katta&quot; (dam), and &quot;gattu&quot; (shore or embankment) in Telugu.

== Geology ==
The Eastern Ghats are an ancient orogenic belt which started forming during the collision of crustal rocks during the archeozoic era. Geologic evidence indicates that these became part of the Indian subcontinent following the break-up of the super-continent of Rodinia and the creation of Gondwana. The mountains were formed over million of years through metamorphism, and erosion and are significantly older than the Western Ghats. The rock layers were largely formed during the mid proterozoic era by the accumulation of silt, carbonates and basalt which later became khondalite and calcium silicate rocks. The major rock types found are charnockite, granite, khondalite, metamorphic, and quartzite.

In the mesoproterozoic era, the range was compacted and re-aligned north-east. The structure includes multiple thrusts and strike-slip faults along its range. The Eparchaean Unconformity of the Tirumala Hills is a major discontinuity of stratigraphic significance that represents an extensive period of erosion and non-deposition, which is evident from the steep natural slopes, and ravines. Along the western edge, sedimentary rocks were deposited due to volcanic activity, which and later formed schist belts. The region consists of bauxite, iron ore and limestone reserves. The major soil types found are red, black, laterite, and alluvial.

== Geography ==
The Eastern Ghats extend from north of the Mahanadi River and runs approximately to the Vaigai basin in the south of Indian peninsula. It covers an area of , traversing across the Indian states of Odisha (25%), Telangana (5%), Andhra Pradesh (40%), Karnataka (5%), and Tamil Nadu (25%).

=== Topography ===
The Eastern Ghats form a discontinuous chain of mountains with an average elevation of and runs parallel to the eastern coast of India along the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern coastal plains are the wide region between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The average width of the mountains range from with the mountains wider in the north and narrower in the south. Arma Konda is the highest peak in the mountains at .

The range can be roughly divided into three separate sections. The northern section of the range lies majorly in Odisha and stretches from the Similipal hills in the north to the Andhra Pradesh border. It has an elevation ranging from with the highest peak at Deomali (1672 m). The central section lies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and stretches up to the Penna River. It consists of two parallel ranges with an average elevation of and is separated by a wide gorge through which the rivers Godavari and Krishna flow. The hills continue as Javadi and Shevaroy Hills, south of Chennai and meet with the Western Ghats at Nilgiris. The Biligiriranga and Malai Mahadeshwara Hills in Karnataka form a corridor linking the two mountain ranges. At the southern end, the range is made up of several smaller hills such as the Sirumalai.


=== Hydrology ===
The Eastern Ghats form one of the major watersheds of India with major river systems such as Godavari, Kaveri, Krishna and Mahanadi cutting across the range. Most rivers flow eastwards towards the Bay of Bengal owing to the steeper gradient moving from east to west. The Eastern Ghats are the source for many small and medium rivers of the east coastal plains.


The streams and rivers give rise to numerous waterfalls in the region. The region also consists of many wetlands and large coastal lagoons such as the Chilika, Kolleru and Pulicat lakes. The rivers have been dammed for hydroelectric and irrigation purposes, with major reservoirs spread across the region.

== Climate ==
As the mountains are discontinuous and have a lower elevation, they have a considerably lesser influence than the Western Ghats on the weather patterns in India. However, orography studies indicate that the range does play a role in rainfall patterns along the coast. The range blocks winds at the low level which brings rainfall to the eastern coastal plains. The Eastern Ghats region has a tropical climate and receives rainfall from the monsoon. It is hot in the summers with temperatures reaching during summer with humidity levels of 65–75%. The northern region receives of rainfall and the lower regions receive of rain. The temperature is lowest in the winter month of January with an average of . The higher hill ranges are generally wetter and cooler with the lower parts remaining semi-arid and dry. The coastal regions experience tropical cyclones during the monsoon season.

== Bio-diversity ==
=== Flora ===
There are nine forest types in the Eastern Ghats region, namely tropical evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, riverine, southern dry deciduous, northern dry deciduous, dry savannah, thorn scrub, and dry evergreen forests. The vegetation varies considerably with altitude with scrubs and dry forests at lower altitudes and deciduous, semi-evergreen forests, and evergreen forests at higher altitudes. Tropical evergreen forests occur in small patches in Shevroy in Tamil Nadu and in north Andhra Pradesh. Semi-evergreen forests are found in the northern section and southern fringes. Moist deciduous forests occur in Odisha and Nallamala in Andhra Pradesh–Telangana. Dry deciduous, dry savannah and scrub forests occur across the range. Dry evergreen forests are limited to south Andhra Pradesh, and north Tamil Nadu.

The region is home to more than 4500 species of angiosperms, which account for 13% of the flowering plant species in India. About 166 species of flowering plants are endemic to the Eastern Ghats and more than ten new species have been discovered in the region since the early 2010s. About 184 species of ferns, and 190 species of orchids have been recorded in the region. Commercially viable tree species include Indian rosewood, teak, mahogany, and red sandalwood.

=== Fauna ===

Mammals found in the region include the Bengal tiger, leopard, sloth bear, striped hyena, Indian wild dog, golden jackal, Indian fox, and other cat species such as jungle cat, fishing cat, and leopard cat. Large herbivores include Indian elephant, blackbuck, sambar deer, spotted deer, barking deer, Indian gazelle, four-horned antelope, Indian bison, wild boar, Indian crested porcupine, mouse deer, and nilgai. Other smaller mammals include grey slender loris, Indian hare, Indian hedgehog, Indian mongoose, mole rat, smooth coated otter, Indian pangolin, palm civet, Indian giant flying squirrel, and Madras treeshrew. Bonnet macaque, rhesus macaque, and Hanuman langur are the major primates. The region is also home to more than 15 species of bats.

Bird surveys have found about 425 species belonging to 57 families in the region. Four species of hornbills are found in the region and are considered keystone species. The Jerdon&#x27;s courser was thought to be extinct in the wild before it was re-discovered in the range in 1986. More than 50% of the wild population of the critically endangered Indian bustard is found in the region. Common and widespread species include the red-vented bulbul, white-browed bulbul, red-whiskered bulbul, common iora, and purple-rumped sunbird. Five species of birds that are endemic to the Western Ghats region have been sighted in the fringes of the Eastern Ghats. These include grey-headed bulbul, Nilgiri wood pigeon, Malabar parakeet, crimson-backed sunbird, and rufous babbler. Other species of avifauna include laughing dove, Indian nightjar, jungle owlet, red avadavat, Malayan night heron, striated heron, white-naped woodpecker, savanna nightjar, brown hawk-owl, Nilgiri flowerpecker, spot-bellied eagle-owl, blue-eared kingfisher, green imperial pigeon, oriental dwarf kingfisher, Indian swiftlet, and white-browed fantail. Raptors included white-eyed buzzard, grey-headed fish eagle, lesser fish eagle. Two species of critically endangered vultures – Indian vulture and red-headed vulture have been reported in the region.

There are about 99 reptile species found in the region. These include Indian monitor lizard, and endemic species such as Yercaud slender gecko, burrowing limbless skink, spotted Eastern Ghats skink, and Madras spotted skink. The Indian golden gecko, and Jeypore ground gecko were rediscovered in 1986 and 2010 respectively. Other reptiles include geckos, skinks, lacertas, iguanas, chameleons, and monitors. Snakes include blind snakes, shield-tailed snakes, sand boas, cobras, vipers, kraits, coral snakes, and python. There are about 100 species of amphibians found in the region including toads, pond frogs, cricket frogs, bull frogs, burrowing frogs, balloon frogs, small-mouthed frogs, tree frogs, and golden-backed frogs. There are also about 155 species of freshwater fish from 28 families found across the waters in the region. Insects include nearly 150 species of butterflies and nine species of tarantulas amongst others.

=== Threats and conservation ===
A 2017 study indicated that the Eastern Ghats region has lost about forest cover between 1920 and 2015. Forests which occupied 43.5% of the land area reduced by nearly 16 percent. An estimated 7.92 percent of the forest area converted for agriculture and 3.80 percent to grasslands from 1920 to 2015. As of 2018, only 3.53 percent of the total area was declared as protected areas. The major threats included illegal logging, mining, grazing, agriculture, forest fires and tourism, poaching, and illegal tapping of forest resources which have resulted in deforestation and fragmentation of forests. Various natural disasters such as heavy rainfalls, extreme temperature, environmental changes, competition due to invasive species have been threats to the biodiversity in the region. The absence of pollinators have also had an effect on the natural regeneration of vegetation.

Till 1980, logging was a major contributor for the loss of forest cover with decrease in tree species such as teak, sal, red sanders, and sandalwood. Though laws in 1988 curtailed illegal logging, wood is still quarried by people for making charcoal, firewood, and construction. Forest produce is a source of income for people living in the fringes of the ranges. Over harvesting of forest produce for fodder, traditional medicine, and domestic uses along with unscientific extraction methods and burning of forests have been threats. The introduction of alien species either by deliberate or non deliberate means have resulted in competition to native species. The construction of large dams across rivers in the region have submerged more than of forest cover.

The Eastern Ghats region is rich in minerals and semi-precious stones. Illegal mining, poor mining processes, over exploitation, and unsafe disposal of debris have resulted in issues bio-degeneration of the areas. Eight of the 29 forest fire prone districts are located in the region and, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh recorded the most forest fires in 2014. With more than 90% of these fires caused by humans, this has resulted in loss of forest cover. Practices such as shifting cultivation, plantations, and illegal encroachments are the major agricultural contributors to deforestation. Increased urbanisation, and expansion of cities, construction of roads and railways, and tourism have led to encroachments into forest lands, and threats to bio-diversity in the region.

The Government of India had enacted various policies over the years to address the environmental concerns, access to forest resources, and protection of wildlife. Three national parks, two biosphere reserves, and 22 wildlife sanctuaries are present in the Eastern Ghats region. The protected areas include five tiger reserves under the Project Tiger, and an elephant reserve under the Project Elephant protection plans. About 13 eco-sensitive zones have been declared, which are jointly managed with the local communities.

<doc id="528242" wikidata="Q1981624" url="?curid=528242" title="Smells Like Children">
<text>Smells Like Children is the first EP by American rock band Marilyn Manson. It was released on October 24, 1995, by Nothing and Interscope Records. Produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, it represents an era of the band full of drugs, abuses, tours, sound experiments, and references to the Child Catcher, a villain from the 1968 musical film &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;.

The EP was initially proposed to strictly be a remix single for &quot;Dope Hat&quot;, but various contributions by engineer and Skinny Puppy producer Dave Ogilvie, Nine Inch Nails live keyboardist Charlie Clouser, and new material by the band resulted in an eclectic and unusual combination of material. All the ideas and tracks for the EP were created and composed throughout the touring cycle in support of the band&#x27;s 1994 debut &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, and was the first Marilyn Manson work to feature longtime members Twiggy Ramirez on bass and Ginger Fish on drums.

&quot;Smells Like Children&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and was spearheaded by its sole single, a cover of &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, originally written and performed by Eurythmics. The song&#x27;s music video became a staple on MTV and helped to establish the band in the mainstream.

==Background and development==
After the conclusion of the &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot; Tour, the band undertook the opening slot position for Danzig&#x27;s 4p Tour from March 24, 1995, until May 14, 1995. During their tenure, Danzig/Pantera tour bus driver Tony F. Wiggins befriended Marilyn Manson, bassist Twiggy Ramirez and keyboardist Madonna Wayne Gacy and went on backstage drug binges, perverse acts and other unusual escapades with them.

==Themes==
The band&#x27;s frontman has discussed his thoughts in retrospect on &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; within his autobiography &quot;The Long Hard Road Out of Hell&quot; (1998):

Manson has considered the release to be &quot;An album that looks like an album for children that is not for children&quot;; in fact, on the outer rim of the CD label the printed words &quot;Keep this and all drugs away from small children&quot; are visible.

==Music==
===Songs===

A number of cover songs are included in the track listing, most famous of which is the band&#x27;s cover of Eurythmics&#x27; &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;, which thrust the band into the mainstream. The other covers on the album are the Patti Smith song &quot;Rock N Roll Nigger&quot; and Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, with the latter later featured on the soundtrack for David Lynch&#x27;s 1997 psychological thriller film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;.

A recorded telephone conversation between Manson&#x27;s mother and grandmother, titled &quot;May Cause Discoloration of the Urine or Feces&quot;, is sometimes included on early bootlegs under the title &quot;Procardia&quot;, in a heavily modified version which is actually a fan-made track, and not an actual track from either pressing—this version contains the original track in the left channel, and an extract from Raggedy Ann in the right. The &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; version was previously featured as part of the sound scape &quot;Revelation #9&quot;, released on the single for &quot;Get Your Gunn&quot;. Some of these bootlegs may also contain bonus tracks, including a demo for the song &quot;My Monkey&quot; from &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;, and another track called &quot;Choklit Factory&quot; taken from the bands&#x27; Spooky Kids-era.
The album alludes to famous occult author Aleister Crowley, particularly in the &quot;Dope Hat&quot; re-recording &quot;Diary of a Dope Fiend&quot; after the Crowley novel &quot;Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot;. The &quot;Frankie&quot; referred to in &quot;Fuck Frankie&quot; is Frankie Proia, Manson&#x27;s tour manager at the time who embezzled $20,000 from the band during their tour for their previous release, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;. Wiggins recorded an acoustic rendition of the song &quot;Cake and Sodomy&quot; under the title &quot;White Trash&quot;. Manson stated the irony of having Wiggins &quot;strum and twang a redneck version&quot; of the song was &quot;perfect for its message, since [it] critiques southern Christian white trash&quot;.

The &quot;One-Legged...&quot; referred to in &quot;Dancing with the One-Legged...&quot; was &quot;a battered doll of Huggy Bear, the pimp from the 1970s cop thriller television series &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, which was missing a leg&quot;. Manson explains, &quot;Inside that empty plastic socket was where we hid our drugs throughout the Tony Wiggins tour. Whenever we ingested the contents of that extra orifice, we referred to it in code as &#x27;dancing with the one-legged pimp&#x27;&quot;. The untitled sixteenth track contains a slower, more ominous remix of &quot;Shitty Chicken Gang Bang&quot; and, approximately 6 minutes in, an unusual audio experiment sometimes referred to as &quot;Poop Games&quot;.

===Samples===
Early promotional copies of &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; featured unauthorized samples from the films &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, as well as other sound bites considered &quot;too extreme&quot;, therefore resulting in the track listing to be re-edited accordingly for public release, much to Manson&#x27;s chagrin. Interscope was not interested in buying licenses to use the film samples and demanded written affidavits from the participants in the sound bites, certifying their consent to be recorded. The removed clips were the original opening track, &quot;Abuse, Part 1 (There is Pain Involved)&quot;, featuring the voices of Manson and Wiggins as they attempted to calm down a masochistic girl when things got out-of-control, and &quot;Abuse, Part 2 (Confessions)&quot;, featuring an interview with a teenage girl who confesses to molesting her 7-year-old male cousin. These were replaced by &quot;The Hands of Small Children&quot; and &quot;May Cause Discoloration of the Urine or Feces&quot;, respectively.

The tracks &quot;Sympathy for the Parents&quot; and &quot;Dancing with the One-Legged...&quot; are distorted sound clips taken from an appearance by Manson, Ramirez and Gacy on &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;. The episode discussed the dangers of moshing at concerts. The excerpt used in &quot;Sympathy for the Parents&quot; features Ramirez responding to a question about the attire worn by the band members by playing a cassette tape recording of &quot;Scabs, Guns and Peanut Butter&quot;, before Manson&#x27;s answer to the same question.

==Singles==

&quot;Smells Like Children&quot; produced only one single, a cover version of Eurythmics&#x27; 1983 hit &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot;.

Manson often drew musical inspiration from his dreams, but the idea to cover this song came from his first experimentation with LSD at a house party, according to his autobiography. He says that he hallucinated a &quot;slower, meaner&quot; version of the dance hit playing, sung in his voice. He also stated that Nothing did not want to release this as a single. Daisy Berkowitz stated &quot;When the song was released it divided people – they loved it or hated it. This was good. Just like us, as a band, if loved – you&#x27;re loved. If hated, people that hate you talk about you even more so&quot;. The label wanted to release their cover of Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins&#x27; &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;, which, according to Manson, &quot;was far too dark, sprawling and esoteric, even for some of our fans.&quot;

The music video for Manson&#x27;s cover was a gateway to popularity for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in what appears to be an old, decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: this was one of the first videos shot with director Dean Karr&#x27;s initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song&#x27;s climax.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, the album met with mixed to negative reviews from music critics. AllMusic gave it a mixed review and said: &quot;Where the full-length debut showed sparks of character and invention beneath industrial metal sludge, &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; is a smartly crafted horror show, filled with vulgarity, ugliness, goth freaks, and sideshow scares. Manson wisely chose to heighten his cartoonish personality with the EP. Most of the record is devoted to spoken words and samples, all designed to push the outrage buttons of middle America. Musically, it may not amount to much—it&#x27;s goth-metal-industrial, as good as the &#x27;Dope Hat,&#x27; &#x27;Lunchbox,&#x27; and &#x27;Cake and Sodomy&#x27; trilogy that distinguished the debut—but as a sonic sculpture, as an &quot;objet d&#x27;art&quot;, it&#x27;s effective and wickedly fascinating. It&#x27;s exactly what Brian Warner needed to do to establish Marilyn Manson as America&#x27;s bogeyman for the late &#x27;90s.&quot;

In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, music critic Robert Christgau defined &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; as an &quot;Unmitigated consumer fraud—a mess of instrumentals, covers, and remixes designed to exploit its well-publicized tour, genderfuck cover art, titillating titles, and parental warning label. The lyrics to &#x27;Shitty Chicken Gang Bang&#x27; are nonexistent, those to &#x27;Everlasting Cocksucker&#x27; incomprehensible. Only &#x27;Fuck Frankie,&#x27; a spoken-word number in which a female feigning sexual ecstasy reveals that it isn&#x27;t &#x27;Fool Frankie&#x27; or &#x27;Fire Frankie&#x27; or &#x27;Fast Frankie&#x27; or for that matter &#x27;Fist Frankie,&#x27; delivers what it promises. It&#x27;s easily the best thing on the record.&quot; Tony Scherman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also gave the release a negative review and called it &quot;an artlessly assembled excuse for an album, these minor-league White Zombie wannabes throw together pointless remixes, irritating skits, and lame covers of songs by Eurythmics, Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, and Patti Smith. Co-producer Trent Reznor should hang his head in shame.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot; Liisa Ladouceur ranked &quot;Smells Like Children&quot; fourth on her list of the essential Marilyn Manson albums. Ladouceur wrote that &quot;[this] collection...was poorly received on release but proves a much more interesting document of the [band&#x27;s] early years than 1994&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Portrait of an American Family&quot;.&quot;

===Controversy===
On May 30, 1996, the co-directors of the conservative advocacy group Empower America (now known as FreedomWorks), Republican Secretary of Education William Bennett and Democrat Senator Joseph Lieberman, organized a bipartisan press conference, along with Secretary of Pennsylvania State C. Delores Tucker, wherein they admonished the record industry for selling &quot;prepackaged, shrink-wrapped nihilism.&quot; Bennett claimed that &quot;nothing less is at stake than civilization&quot; against lyrics which Lieberman decried, &quot;celebrate some of the most antisocial and immoral behaviors imaginable.&quot; Tucker concurred noting that, &quot;these companies have the blood of children on their hands ... We protect owls. We protect whales. We must protect children.&quot;

The moral crusaders largely targeted rap music and five music conglomerates: Time Warner, Bertelsmann Music Group, PolyGram, Thorn EMI, and Sony Music—leaving out MCA (which had recently acquired Interscope at the time)—an absence MTV noted as &quot;strange&quot;, leading them to postulate &quot;that perhaps Tucker or Bennett own some stock in the company&quot;. Nevertheless, the group did not forget to bring up Marilyn Manson and &quot;Smells Like Children&quot;. Empower America also took the opportunity to announce, at the press conference, they were launching a $25,000 radio ad campaign to collect petitions from listeners who want the record companies to &quot;stop spreading this vicious, vulgar music.&quot;

<doc id="528249" wikidata="Q1342704" url="?curid=528249" title="Code review">
<text>Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or more people examine the source code of a computer program, either after implementation or during the development process. The persons performing the checking, excluding the author, are called &quot;reviewers&quot;. At least one reviewer must not be the code&#x27;s author.

Code review differs from related software quality assurance techniques like static code analysis, self-checks, testing, and pair programming. Static analysis relies primarily on automated tools, self-checks involve only the author, testing requires code execution, and pair programming is performed continuously during development rather than as a separate step.

== Goal ==
Although direct discovery of quality problems is often the main goal, code reviews are usually performed to reach a combination of goals:

* &quot;Improving code quality&quot; Improve internal code quality and maintainability through better readability, uniformity, and understandability
* &quot;Detecting defects&quot;Improve quality regarding external aspects, especially correctness, but also find issues such as performance problems, security vulnerabilities, and injected malware
* &quot;Learning/Knowledge transfer&quot;Sharing codebase knowledge, solution approaches, and quality expectations, both to the reviewers and the author
* &quot;Increase sense of mutual responsibility&quot;Increase a sense of collective code ownership and solidarity
* &quot;Finding better solutions&quot;Generate ideas for new and better solutions and ideas beyond the specific code at hand
* &quot;Complying to QA guidelines, ISO/IEC standards&quot;Code reviews are mandatory in some contexts, such as air traffic software and safety-critical software

== Review types ==

Several variations of code review processes exist, with additional types specified in IEEE 1028.

* Management reviews
* Technical reviews
* Inspections
* Walk-throughs
* Audits

=== Inspection (formal) ===

Historically, the first code review process that was studied and described in detail was called &quot;Inspection&quot; by its inventor, Michael Fagan. Fagan inspection is a formal process that involves a careful and detailed execution with multiple participants and phases. In formal code reviews, software developers attend a series of meetings to examine code line by line, often using printed copies. Research has shown formal inspections to be extremely thorough and highly effective at identifying defects.

=== Regular change-based code review (Walk-throughs) ===
Software development teams typically adopt a more lightweight review process in which the scope of each review is on the changes to the codebase performed in a ticket, user story, commit, or some other unit of work. Furthermore, there are rules or conventions that integrate the review task into the development workflow through conventions like mandatory review of all tickets, commonly as part of a pull request, instead of explicitly planning each review. Such a process is called &quot;regular, change-based code review&quot;. There are many variations of this basic process. A 2017 survey of 240 development teams found that 90% of teams using code review followed a change-based process, with 60% specifically using regular change-based review. Major software corporations including such as Microsoft, Google, and Facebook follow a change-based code review process.

== Efficiency and effectiveness ==

Ongoing research by Capers Jones analyzing over 12,000 software development projects found formal inspections had a latent defect discovery rate of 60-65%, while informal inspections detected fewer than 50% of defects. The latent defect discovery rate for most forms of testing is about 30%. A code review case study published in the book &quot;Best Kept Secrets of Peer Code Review&quot; contradicted the Capers Jones study, finding that lightweight reviews can uncover as many bugs as formal reviews while being more efficient in terms of cost and money

Studies indicate that up to 75% of code review comments affect software evolvability and maintainability rather than functionality, suggesting that code reviews are an excellent tool for software companies with long product or system life cycles. Therefore, less than 15% of issues discussed in code reviews relate directly to bugs.

=== Guidelines ===

Research indicates review effectiveness correlates with review speed. Optimal code review rates range from 200 to 400 lines of code per hour. Inspecting and reviewing more than a few hundred lines of code per hour for critical software (such as safety critical embedded software) may be too fast to find errors.

=== Supporting tools ===

Static code analysis software assist reviewers by automatically checking source code for known vulnerabilities and defect patterns, particularly for large chunks of code. A 2012 study by VDC Research reports that 17.6% of the embedded software engineers surveyed currently use automated tools to support peer code review and 23.7% planning to use them within two years.

<text>The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (c. 47) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which allowed Westminster to devolve power to Northern Ireland, after decades of direct rule.

It renamed the New Northern Ireland Assembly, established by the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, to the Northern Ireland Assembly.

It repealed parts of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, and established new rules in line with the European Union and the Northern Ireland peace process, subsequent to the Belfast Agreement of 1998.

The act allows for a devolved Northern Ireland Assembly of 108 members. Membership of the assembly is subject to a pledge of office, which subjects the member to certain requirements with regard to standards and responsibilities. Northern Ireland remains a part of the United Kingdom until or unless a majority vote in a referendum determines otherwise. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland holds the power to call for the referendum if it appears likely to them that a majority of the voters would express their desire to become part of a United Ireland. The assembly has the power of modifying any act of the British Parliament as far as it &quot;is part of the law of Northern Ireland&quot;. They cannot deal, however, with reserved or excepted matters, which are of exclusive competence of the government of the United Kingdom, in consultation with the Republic of Ireland through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. The Assembly has been suspended a number of times since 1998, and was re-established on Tuesday 8 May 2007, subsequent to the St Andrews Agreement of 2006.

Election to the assembly is by single transferable vote (STV), a form of proportional representation.

<text>Melinda and Melinda is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Woody Allen. The film is set in Manhattan and stars Radha Mitchell as the protagonist Melinda, in two storylines; one tragic and the other comic. It premiered at the 2004 San Sebastián International Film Festival and was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on March 18, 2005, by Fox Searchlight Pictures.

==Plot==
Four writers converse over dinner about the value of comedy and tragedy. The question arises: Is life naturally comic or tragic? One of the four proposes a real story he heard somewhere else: a distraught woman named Melinda disrupts a dinner party held by a couple, and a series of events involving affairs and a suicide attempt ensues. The two prominent playwrights in the group begin telling their versions of this story, one being comic and one tragic.

In the tragic story, Melinda, a widowed friend of the couple (consisting of failed actor Lee and wealthy socialite Laurel), ends up staying at their house. During the course of the story, she loses the custody of her children due to her history of alcoholism and drug abuse. Believing Melinda is depressed due to the loss of her family, Laurel decides to help her look for a boyfriend. At a party, the two women end up falling for the same man, a pianist and composer named Ellis Moonsong. Melinda starts dating Ellis, who also starts an affair with Laurel. During a date, Melinda reveals to Ellis that her husband&#x27;s death was not accidental, as everyone believes. She actually killed him after discovering that he had been cheating on her. One evening, Laurel finds out Lee is having an affair with an acting student of his. Defending himself, Lee mentions he knows Laurel is cheating on him with Ellis, and Melinda overhears this. After Laurel and Ellis confirm this to her, a distressed Melinda attempts to jump off a building. However, Ellis manages to save her.

In the comedic story, Melinda is a neighbor of the couple (consisting of failed actor Hobie and aspiring filmmaker Susan). Hobie is smitten by Melinda and develops a friendship with her. Despite his relationship with Susan being fraught, Hobie feels guilty about even considering an affair. While at a store, he finds an old lamp and rubs it while wishing for a way to have a romantic relationship with Melinda without hurting Susan. When Hobie returns home, he finds Susan having sex with one of the possible candidates to produce her next film. Delighted, Hobie breaks up with Susan and asks Melinda out. However, before he can confess his feelings for her, Hobie discovers Melinda started a relationship with a pianist she met on the street. Melinda and her new boyfriend decide to help a secretly jealous Hobie find a girlfriend. They set him up with a &quot;Playboy&quot; model, and the four go on a date on Halloween that involves seeing a movie and attending a party. There, the two strangers realize they both feel lonely and decide to go to Hobie&#x27;s apartment to have sex. Seeing them leave the party together, a hurt Melinda realizes she has feelings for Hobie. Back at his place, before they can have sex, the model realizes she is still sad about her previous break-up. She tries to throw herself off the building before Hobie stops her. After she is gone, Hobie finds Melinda spying on him, and they both confess their feelings for each other.

Without reaching a true conclusion on the value of tragedy and comedy, the writers realize that it is important to appreciate the tragic and comedic moments in life as one never knows when it will end.

==Cast==
Mitchell plays Melinda in both versions. Sevigny, Miller, and Ejiofor star with her in the tragedy, while Ferrell and Peet star with her in the comedy. Carell has a small part as Ferrell&#x27;s character&#x27;s friend.

==Production==
Woody Allen said in &quot;Conversations with Woody Allen&quot; that he wanted to cast Winona Ryder in the title role. He had to replace her with Radha Mitchell because no one would insure Ryder due to her arrest for shoplifting; this would have made it impossible to obtain a film completion bond. Allen stated he was sad because he had written the part for Ryder after working with her on &quot;Celebrity&quot; (1998). In the same interview, he also claimed to have intended Ferrell&#x27;s part for Robert Downey Jr., but, again, insurance got in the way due to Downey&#x27;s history of arrests and drug abuse.

The film also stars Wallace Shawn (alluding to his dinner-philosophy argument in &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;) as the comic playwright, Larry Pine as the tragedian, and Brooke Smith as Cassie. All three had appeared in the 1994 film &quot;Vanya on 42nd Street&quot;, directed by Louis Malle.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; grossed $3.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $16.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $20.1 million. The film opened on March 18, 2005, in one New York City cinema, where it grossed $74,238 in its first three days. On its second weekend, it expanded to 95 theaters to gross $740,619, seeing its per-screen average drop to $7,795.

===Critical response===
&quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 51% based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Woody Allen&#x27;s uneven &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; fails to find neither comedy nor pathos in what seems like a rehash of his previous themes.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 54 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Leonard Maltin gave the film two stars, calling it &quot;meandering&quot;, with &quot;echoes ... of earlier, better Allen movies&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack album to the film was released on March 8, 2005, by Milan Records. It mostly features a selection of swing music and big band tracks, which is typical for Allen&#x27;s films.

<text>The Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute is an institute under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) with the mandate for developing new techniques for the design of agricultural experiments as well as to analyze data in agriculture. The institute is affiliated with and is located in the campus of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, a deemed university, at Pusa in New Delhi. The institute includes sections that specialize in statistical techniques for animal and plant breeding, bioinformatics, sampling, experimental design, modelling and forecasting.

== Origin and history ==

In 1930 the, then, Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, started a statistical unit to assist the State Departments of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry in planning their experiments, analysis of experimental data, interpretation of results and rendering advice on the formulation of the technical programmes of the Council. This unit was established on the recommendation of Leslie Coleman.

This unit was headed from 1940 by the statistician Dr. P.V.Sukhatme who had studied with Jerzy Neyman in London. The early research was on reliable methods for collecting yield statistics of principal food crops.

Further research in sampling and statistics was initiated and this became a Statistical Branch in 1945. The branch soon acquired international recognition as a centre for research and training in the field of Agricultural Statistics. In 1949 it was named as Statistical Wing of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). In 1952, at the recommendations of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) experts Dr Frank Yates and Dr D. J. Finney it was expanded and in 1955 it moved to the Pusa campus. On 2 July 1959 it was renamed as the Institute of Agricultural Research Statistics (IARS).

In 1964, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi and courses in M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees were offered.

In 1964, it was one of the few institutes with a computer, an IBM 1620 Model-II Electronic Computer. In 1970, it became a full institute under the ICAR and the name was changed to Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute (IASRI) on 1 January 1978.

In 1977, a third generation computer Burroughs B-4700 system was installed in a new building. In 1991–95, the old computers were replaced by new networked PC systems.

<doc id="528259" wikidata="Q486554" url="?curid=528259" title="Parasite single">
<text>A is a single person who lives with their parents beyond their late 20s or early 30s to enjoy a more carefree and comfortable life. In Japanese culture, the term is especially used when negatively describing young unmarried women.

==Etymology==
The expression &quot;parasaito shinguru&quot; was first used by Masahiro Yamada of Tokyo Gakugei University in his book , published in October 1999.

Yamada subsequently coined the related term &quot;parasite couple&quot; to refer to married children living with the parents of one partner.

==Social impact==
One possible side-effect of the parasite single phenomenon is the increase of the average age of the first marriage (though this is also attributable to other factors, such as career prospects and education). While in 1970, Japanese women married on average at age 24 and men at age 27, by 2002, this had increased to 27.4 years for women and 29 years for men. This has also resulted in women having children later in life, and fewer children overall due to the decline in fertility after age 30. Subsequently, while in 1983 there were on average 1.8 children born to every woman over her lifetime, this has decreased to 1.22 children per woman in 2008.

== Similar arrangements outside Japan ==
These lifestyles are not confined to Japanese society; similar arrangements can also be found in other cultures. In Italy, parasite singles were offensively called &quot;bamboccioni&quot; (&quot;grown-up big spoiled babies&quot;) in 2007 by former minister Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, voluntarily ignoring the situation of a considerable part of the 20- to 30-year-old population. In post-communist Central Europe, the phenomenon is more accepted, possibly due to socio-economic reasons and soaring housing prices. In English-speaking nations, the term &quot;basement dweller&quot; has connotations that imply a person lives with their parents because they do not have enough money to move out, and if they had enough money would be living on their own.

A different concept of parasite single is found in Brazil, where some individuals are said to have a &quot;Paitrocínio&quot; (a wordplay between the words pai/father and patrocínio/sponsorship). This word is used not for the ones living in their parents&#x27; homes, but for the ones who did leave home, but still rely solely, or majorly, on their parents&#x27; financial support. The reasons for leaving home before achieving financial independence vary, but mostly it is due to college or to start a career with small or uncertain initial incomes, such as in arts and sports.

==Health==
Most pre-sliced lunch meats are higher in fat, nitrates, and sodium than those that are sliced to order, as a larger exposed surface requires stronger preservatives. As a result, processed meats may significantly contribute to incidence of heart disease and diabetes, even more so than red meat.

A prospective study following 448,568 people across Europe, showed a positive association between processed meat consumption and mortality caused by cardiovascular disease and cancer. Similarly, a prospective study in the US following half a million people flagged a similar association between death and increased processed meat consumption. The World Cancer Research Fund International guidelines on cancer prevention recommend avoiding all processed meats.

==Safety==
Deli lunch meat is occasionally infected by &quot;Listeria&quot;. In 2011, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) advises that those over age 50 reheat lunch meats to &quot;steaming hot&quot; and use them within four days. In 2021, the US CDC reported another wave of &quot;Listeria&quot; outbreak. The final investigation notice from 2023 advises that &quot;people who are pregnant, aged 65 or older, or have a weakened immune system&quot; reheat deli products to the aforementioned temperature in order to &quot;kill any germs&quot;, even when there is no outgoing outbreak.

<text>Robert Frederick Ford is an American video game programmer. He is the son of mathematician L. R. Ford Jr. A co-founder of the video game studio Toys for Bob, he led the company from its inception until late 2020 with his co-founder Paul Reiche III. Ford is the co-creator, with Reiche III, of the &quot;Star Control&quot; universe. Ford did the programming, while Reiche was responsible for the game design and fiction. Ford was also the lead programmer on &quot;The Horde&quot; and &quot;Pandemonium&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Beginnings and &quot;Star Control&quot; ===
Ford attended the University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1980s, Ford began his game career while in college, creating games exclusively for the Japanese market. Working for a company called Unison World (later Magicsoft), he worked on his first games for a Japanese monochrome handheld, including a bowling game, a bi-plane flight game, and a tank game. Soon after, he moved onto developing for the NEC PC-6000 series, the MSX, and Fujitsu systems, with titles such as &quot;Pillbox, Sea Bomber,&quot; and &quot;Ground Support.&quot;

Ford was working on an unreleased title, when Magicsoft ran out of money. This led Ford to transition to more corporate employment. He worked for graphics companies in Silicon Valley, until he realized he missed working in the game industry. Ford told friends he was seeking a designer-artist to collaborate with, and his friends knew Paul Reiche III was seeking a programmer-engineer. Ford and Reiche had actually attended college together, and their friends arranged to re-introduce them at a game night hosted by game designer Greg Johnson. One of the friends who encouraged the get-together was fantasy artist Erol Otus

Reiche and Ford&#x27;s first collaboration was &quot;Star Control&quot;, with Ford focused on programming, and Reiche focused on the game design and fiction. Originally called &quot;Starcon&quot;, the game began as an evolution of the concepts that Reiche first created in &quot;.&quot; &quot;Archon&quot;″s strategic elements were adapted for &quot;Star Control&quot; into a space setting, with one-on-one ship combat inspired by the classic 1962 game &quot;Spacewar!&quot;. As Ford and Reiche&#x27;s workflow as a team was developing, the game took on a more limited scope compared to the sequel. Upon its release in 1990, &quot;Star Control&quot; was voted the &quot;Best Science Fiction Game&quot; by &quot;Video Games and Computer Entertainment&quot;. Decades later, it is remembered as one of the greatest games of all time. &quot;[A]s a melee or strategic game, it helped define the idea that games can be malleable and dynamic and players can make an experience wholly their own.&quot;

The success of their first game led to a more ambitious sequel in &quot;Star Control II&quot;. Reiche and Ford aimed to go beyond ship combat to develop a &quot;science fiction adventure role-playing game&quot;. Their goal of creating a dynamic space adventure was largely inspired by &quot;Starflight,&quot; created by Greg Johnson. A few years earlier, Reiche had been friends with Johnson. During the game&#x27;s creation, Reiche was inspired to offer creative input for Johnson&#x27;s expansive science fiction game. This friendship and mutual admiration led Reiche and Ford to hire Johnson for Star Control II. The duo later credited Johnson as one of the game&#x27;s most significant contributors. &quot;Star Control&quot;″s story and characters were vastly expanded from the story and characters in the first game. As Reiche and Ford worked on the first version of the game&#x27;s dialog, they recognized they needed help with the writing and art and were forced to enlist the help of friends and family. In addition to Johnson, they recruited long-time friend Erol Otus, who contributed music, text, art, and illustrations for the game&#x27;s manual, and (later) voice-acting. Through mutual friends, they acquired the talents of famed fantasy artist George Barr. The project eventually ran over schedule, and the budget from publisher Accolade ran out. During the final months of development, Fred Ford supported the team financially.

&quot;Star Control II&quot; became one of the best games of all time, according to numerous publications in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. It is also ranked among the best games in several specific areas, including: writing, world design, character design, and music. The game also influenced other titles, most notably the open-ended gameplay of Tim Cain&#x27;s &quot;Fallout&quot;, the world design of &quot;Mass Effect&quot;, and the story events of &quot;Stellaris&quot;.

=== Toys for Bob ===
Ford and Reiche began branding themselves as Toys for Bob, with &quot;The Horde&quot; as the studio&#x27;s first official title. By this point, Reiche and Ford were doing contract work for game publisher Crystal Dynamics, with their three-person studio recruiting Fred Ford&#x27;s brother, Ken. &quot;The Horde&quot; was a fantasy action-strategy hybrid game comparable to &quot;Star Control II,&quot; and was notable for including performances from actors Kirk Cameron and Michael Gregory.

=== Acquisition by Activision and &quot;Skylanders&quot; breakthrough ===
Toys for Bob secured Activision as their new publisher, thanks to an introduction from former Toys for Bob staff who had founded Shaba Games and been acquired by Activision. The publisher offered Toys for Bob the Disney license for &quot;Disney&#x27;s Extreme Skate Adventure,&quot; which led to a 2003 game release. This successful relationship led to Toys for Bob being acquired by Activision in May 2005. The company became a wholly owned subsidiary, and the management team and employees signed long-term contracts under the new corporate structure. Working with Activision, Toys for Bob continued to focus on licensed video games, such as &quot;Madagascar&quot;. However, the market for these types of games began to dry up, in part due to the negative reputation created by other licensed games.

The company searched for new opportunities. One such idea came from Toys for Bob character designer I-Wei Huang, who had been creating toys and robots in his spare time. The company saw the potential to adopt these toys and character designs into a game, with technical engineer Robert Leyland applying his hobby in building electronics. Coincidentally, Activision merged with Vivendi Games in 2008, and asked Toys for Bob to create a new game around Vivendi&#x27;s &quot;Spyro&quot; franchise. The team saw the potential for toy-game interaction and suggested to Activision that it would be ideal for &quot;Spyro&quot;″s rich universe of characters. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick responded well to the idea, and gave the team an additional year of development to better refine the technology, the manufacturing process, and the gameplay. Ford credits Activision for funding the expensive and risky development, &quot;we could have thought of this idea as independents and never got it made.&quot; This culminated in the 2011 release of &quot;&quot;, which became a breakthrough success for the developer, their most notable game since &quot;Star Control&quot;.

In October 2017 Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III announced they would be working on a direct sequel to &quot;Star Control II&quot; called &quot;Ghosts of the Precursors&quot;.

=== Star Control intellectual property split ===
In 2018, Stardock sued Paul Reiche III along with Fred Ford in &quot;Stardock Systems, Inc. v. Reiche&quot;, for trademark infringement of the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark. During the course of the lawsuit, Stardock trademarked numerous alien names from Star Control 1 and 2. Reiche and Ford asserted that Atari only owned the game name, marketing content and the new aliens in Star Control 3, and that the in-game alien names to the first two games were never Atari&#x27;s to sell. Litigation ended at June 2019 when both sides reached a settlement that involved the parties exchanging honey for mead and the parties agreeing that Stardock has exclusive rights of the Star Control name with a list of alien names from the first two games being for the exclusive use for Reiche and Ford.

<doc id="528271" wikidata="Q2376341" url="?curid=528271" title="Paul Reiche III">
<text>Paul Reiche III ( ) is an American game designer. His career started in the pen and paper RPG industry, where he collaborated with artist Erol Otus on games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Gamma World. He then transitioned into video games, working with Jon Freeman to establish Free Fall Associates and developed titles like Mail Order Monsters, World Tour Golf, and Archon. Later, he left Free Fall to establish Toys for Bob with Fred Ford. Their first collaboration resulted in &quot;Star Control&quot;. After a successful sequel, they declined to make a third installment, instead focusing on other projects including the successful Skylanders franchise.

==Career==

===Pen and paper RPGs===
Reiche was a childhood friend of artist Erol Otus, before either of them worked in the role-playing game industry. He and Otus played role-playing games together and released a few small games in the genre. After Otus joined TSR, the then-publisher of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;), Reiche was able to eventually find employment there as a writer.

They made contributions to the evolving game and other games by TSR—Otus with artwork, Reiche with game design (primarily on &quot;D&amp;D&quot; and &quot;Gamma World&quot;). Reiche&#x27;s credits as developer include &quot;Isle of Dread&quot;, &quot;Slave Pits of the Undercity&quot; and &quot;Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost Tower of Inverness&quot;, and he also contributed to Gary Gygax&#x27;s &quot;Legion of Gold&quot; for &quot;Gamma World&quot;. Reiche also invented the race of Thri-kreen mantis warriors for &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, which debuted in the second set of &quot;Monster Cards&quot;.

===Video games===

Through his work at TSR, he met Jon Freeman, co-founder of computer game company Automated Systems (later Epyx), and together they decided to start a new gaming studio called Free Fall Associates. During this time, Reiche worked on &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot;, &quot;World Tour Golf&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, which were released with Electronic Arts. Around this time, Reiche also befriended Greg Johnson and became fascinated with his expansive science fiction game &quot;Starflight&quot;. Johnson had many conversations with Reiche, who advised him to draft a &quot;story network&quot; that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. Reiche&#x27;s work on &quot;Starflight&quot; lasted a few weeks, while he was &quot;supposed to be working on &quot;Mail Order Monsters&quot;&quot;.

=== Toys for Bob ===

After several successful releases, Reiche left Free Fall to form Toys for Bob with Fred Ford. Though they had previously attended the same school, they had never met until a games night arranged by friends, both seeking a partner to work on a new project. One of the mutual friends who helped introduce them was fantasy artist Erol Otus. This led to their first collaboration, the game &quot;Star Control&quot;. Reiche and Ford both shared a love of Jack Vance in both their formative years, and took inspiration from exaggerated societies taken to their extremes, and intelligent characters committed to an interesting agenda. While Reiche focused on the game design and fiction, Ford was responsible for the programming.

After publishing the game, Accolade contracted with Reiche and Ford to develop the sequel, &quot;Star Control II&quot;. As the project developed, he hired longtime friend Greg Johnson, who is credited as &quot;one of the most significant contributors to Star Control II&quot;. The project would draw inspiration from &quot;Starflight&quot;, which Reiche had helped with just a few years prior. Another friend, Erol Otus, is described as one of the broadest contributors in terms of different aspects of &quot;Star Control II&quot;, including illustrations for the game manual, in-game art, music, text, and even voice-acting. Reiche himself voiced the Mycon and the neo-Dnyarri (also known as the Talking Pet).

After the success of &quot;Star Control II&quot;, Accolade offered Reiche and Ford the same budget to produce another sequel, which they turned down to pursue other projects. Toys for Bob proceeded to release &quot;Pandemonium!&quot; and &quot;The Unholy War&quot;, and eventually took on a series of contracts for licensed work through the early 2000s. By 2002, Toys for Bob parted ways with Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Interactive, and began seeking a new publisher. After completing &quot;Disney&#x27;s Extreme Skate Adventure&quot; (under the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater&quot; license), Reiche had all-but released &quot;Madagascar&quot; when publisher Activision fully acquired his company, in May 2005. What had begun as a partnership had evolved into a division of Crystal Dynamics, then a corporation, and finally a studio within Activision.

=== Under Activision ===

Reiche would continue to work on licensed properties such as &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Downhill Jam&quot;. In that time, Activision gained the Spyro license, and suggested that Toys for Bob come up with something. This culminated in the release of &quot;&quot; in 2011, with Reiche as Toys for Bob&#x27;s Creative Director. The game became a surprise success, and his most notable game since &quot;Star Control&quot;. The next year, they followed up with the successful release of &quot;&quot;, building a new franchise with one billion dollars in sales just 15 months after the first game. The series was one of the first and most successful to utilize the toys-to-life feature, and the soaring demand would challenge Reiche to release &quot;&quot; on 10 platforms simultaneously, in 2014.

After years of requests from fans, Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III announced they would be working on a direct sequel to the story of &quot;Star Control II&quot;.

=== Star Control intellectual property split ===
In 2018, Stardock sued Paul Reiche III along with Fred Ford in &quot;Stardock Systems, Inc. v. Reiche&quot;, for trademark infringement of the &quot;Star Control&quot; trademark. During the course of the lawsuit, Stardock trademarked numerous alien names from Star Control 1 and 2. Reiche and Ford asserted that Atari only owned the game name, marketing content and the new aliens in &quot;Star Control 3&quot;, and that the in-game alien names to the first two games were never Atari&#x27;s to sell. Litigation ended at June 2019 when both sides reached a settlement agreeing that Stardock has exclusive rights of the Star Control name with a list of alien names from the first two games being for the exclusive use for Reiche and Ford.

<text>Add N to (X) were an English electronic music band formed in London in 1994. The original members were Andrew Aveling, Barry Smith (aka Barry 7) and Ann Shenton. Steven Claydon replaced Aveling in 1997.

After several releases on small labels, they signed to the independent label Mute Records in 1998, and achieved modest commercial success before splitting in 2003.

Several of their songs and music videos are adult/sex-related: the video for &quot;Metal Fingers in My Body&quot; is an animated short featuring a woman having sex with a robot, and their video for &quot;Plug Me In&quot; features porn actresses playing with sex toys.

==Biography==
In 1994, Andrew Aveling met Justin Anderson from Freaky Realistic, and together they started a band named Radix Couplment. Andrew was dating Ann Shenton at this time, and got her involved on the project. Andrew then asked his friend Barry Smith (a former Radio Prague DJ) if he too would be interested in joining. They then spent some time gigging under this name before a fall out which led to Anderson&#x27;s departure from the band. There being only three remaining Andrew then renamed the group Add N to X, based upon a mathematical formula. They kept the name but placed brackets around the X for legal reasons. They then enlisted Steven Claydon, who remained with the group until its dissolution. The band released &quot;Vero Electronics&quot; (1996) on the Blow Up label.

1997 saw the band twice awarded &#x27;Single of the Week&#x27; by the &quot;NME&quot; (for &quot;The Black Regent&quot; and &quot;King Wasp&quot;).

Second album &quot;On the Wires of Our Nerves&quot; was released in 1998, and was described as &quot;like Stereolab/Suicide with a rocket shoved up their rectum&quot;. The album was played heavily by BBC Radio 1 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs on her show, &quot;The Breezeblock&quot;.

The group performed live regularly, often augmenting their core three-piece line up with either one or two acoustic drummers, and sometimes additional musicians playing extra synths and/or electric guitar. Equipment used live included EMS Synthi AKS (usually thrown around by Barry 7), Korg MS-20, Moog Rogue, EDP Wasp, Omnichord, and ARP 2600.

They often utilized distinctive artwork for the videos and record sleeves, a fetishistic collage of sexual imagery with analogue electronic equipment, based in part on the movie and book &quot;Demon Seed&quot;.

The band signed to Mute Records and released three more albums, &quot;Avant Hard&quot;, &quot;Add Insult to Injury&quot; and &quot;Loud Like Nature&quot;. They also released the single &quot;Little Black Rocks in the Sun&quot;, which was issued on 10 inch hexagonal vinyl. Shenton was reportedly overwhelmed by the pressures of the &quot;Loud Like Nature&quot; tour, and either left the group or was fired. In 2003, Smith and Claydon continued touring the United States without Shenton. The band broke up shortly thereafter.
Barry Smith runs the Horseglue Records store and label with his partner Ethan Reid. Ann Shenton has formed a new group, Large Number, and record label, White Label Music. Steven Claydon is now known for his artwork and in 2006 was included in a group show at Tate Modern. Aveling now plays in Littl&#x27;ans.

<text>An album is a collection of audio recordings (e.g., music) issued on a medium such as compact disc (CD), vinyl (record), audio tape (like 8-track or cassette), or digital. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records (78s) collected in a bound book resembling a photo album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at  rpm.

The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century, a period known as the &quot;album era&quot;. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983, being gradually supplanted by the cassette tape throughout the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s before sharply declining during the 1990s. The cassette had largely disappeared by the first decade of the 2000s.

Most albums are recorded in a studio, although they may also be recorded in a concert venue, at home, in the field, or a mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between a few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately, and then brought or &quot;mixed&quot; together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed &quot;live&quot;, even when done in a studio. Studios are built to absorb sound, eliminating reverberation, to assist in mixing different takes; other locations, such as concert venues and some &quot;live rooms&quot;, have reverberation, which creates a &quot;live&quot; sound. Recordings, including live, may contain editing, sound effects, voice adjustments, etc. With modern recording technology, artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones; with each part recorded as a separate track.

Album covers and liner notes are used, and sometimes additional information is provided, such as analysis of the recording, and lyrics or librettos. Historically, the term &quot;album&quot; was applied to a collection of various items housed in a book format. In musical usage, the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later, collections of related 78s were bundled in book-like albums (one side of a 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound). When LP records were introduced, a collection of pieces or songs on a single record was called an &quot;album&quot;; the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc, MiniDisc, compact audio cassette, 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.

==History==
An &quot;album&quot; (Latin , white), in ancient Rome, was a board chalked or painted white, on which decrees, edicts, and other public notices were inscribed in black. It was from this that in medieval and modern times, album came to denote a book of blank pages in which verses, autographs, sketches, photographs and the like are collected. This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as a collection of audio recordings issued as a single item.

The first audio albums were actually published by the publishers of photograph albums. Single 78 rpm records were sold in a brown heavy paper sleeve with a large hole in the center so the record&#x27;s label could be seen. The fragile records were stored on their sides. By the mid-1920s, photo album publishers sold collections of empty sleeves of heavier paper in bound volumes with stiff covers slightly larger than the 10&quot; popular records. (Classical records measured 12&quot;.) On the paper cover in small type were the words &quot;Record Album&quot;. Now records could be stored vertically with the record not touching the shelf, and the term was applied to the collection.

In the early nineteenth century, &quot;album&quot; was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets, such as Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Album for the Young&quot; Opus 68, a set of 43 short pieces.

With the advent of 78 rpm records in the early 1900s, the typical 10-inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side, so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. Classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s, playing around 4–5 minutes per side. For example, in 1924, George Gershwin recorded a drastically shortened version of his new seventeen-minute composition &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. The recording was issued on both sides of a single record, Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s. By 1910, though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works, the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the 1920s.

By about 1910, bound collections of empty sleeves with a paperboard or leather cover, similar to a photograph album, were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records (the term &quot;record album&quot; was printed on some covers). These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them. In the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78s by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums, typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover. Most albums included three or four records, with two sides each, making six or eight compositions per album.

By the mid-1930s, record companies had adopted the album format for classical music selections that were longer than the roughly eight minutes that fit on both sides of a classical 12&quot; 78 rpm record. Initially the covers were plain, with the name of the selection and performer in small type. In 1938, Columbia Records hired the first graphic designer in the business to design covers, others soon followed and colorful album covers cover became an important selling feature.

By the later &#x27;30s, record companies began releasing albums of previously released recordings of popular music in albums organized by performer, singers or bands, or by type of music, boogie-woogie, for example.

When Columbia introduced the Long Playing record format in 1948, it was natural the term album would continue. Columbia expected that the record size distinction in 78s would continue, with classical music on 12&quot; records and popular music on 10&quot; records, and singles on 78s. Columbia&#x27;s first popular 10&quot; LP in fact was Frank Sinatra&#x27;s first album, the four-record eight-song &quot;The Voice of Frank Sinatra&quot;, originally issued in 1946.

RCA&#x27;s introduction of the smaller 45 rpm format later in 1948 disrupted Columbia&#x27;s expectations. By the mid-1950s, 45s dominated the singles market and 12&quot; LPs dominated the album market and both 78s and 10&quot; LPs were discontinued. In the 1950s albums of popular music were also issued on 45s, sold in small heavy paper-covered &quot;gate-fold&quot; albums with multiple discs in sleeves or in sleeves in small boxes. This format disappeared around 1960. Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot; was issued in 1952 on two extended play 45s, with two songs on each side, in both packagings.

The 10-inch and 12-inch LP record (long play), or  rpm microgroove vinyl record, is a gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. A single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as a typical album of 78s, and it was adopted by the record industry as a standard format for the &quot;album&quot;. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.

The term &quot;album&quot; was extended to other recording media such as 8-track tape, cassette tape, compact disc, MiniDisc, and digital albums, as they were introduced. As part of a trend of shifting sales in the music industry, some observers feel that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album.

==Length==
An album may contain any number of tracks. In the United States, The Recording Academy&#x27;s rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise a minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or a minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement. In the United Kingdom, the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that a recording counts as an &quot;album&quot; if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes. Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as mini-albums or EPs. Albums such as &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, &quot;Amarok&quot;, and &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot; by Mike Oldfield, and Yes&#x27;s &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, include fewer than four tracks, but still surpass the 25-minute mark. The album &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; by Sleep contains only a single track, but the composition is over 63 minutes long. There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as &quot;albums&quot;.

If an album becomes too long to fit onto a single vinyl record or CD, it may be released as a double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in a single case, or a triple album containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with a unified design, often containing one or more albums (in this scenario, these releases can sometimes be referred to as a &quot;two (or three)-fer&quot;), or a compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as box sets. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once, in the form of boxed sets, although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album.

==Tracks==

Material (music or sounds) is stored on an album in sections termed tracks. A music track (often simply referred to as a track) is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks; the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings a track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On a compact disc the track number is indexed so that a player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content.

A track that has the same name as the album is called the title track.

===Bonus tracks=== 

A bonus track (also known as a bonus cut or bonus) is a piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as a marketing promotion, or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles, B-sides, live recordings, and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums, where those tracks were not originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves; bonus tracks may be included if a customer buys a whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as a stand-alone download, adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to hidden tracks, bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have a gap of silence between other album tracks. Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists; since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying a domestically released version, Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase.

==Audio formats==
===Non-audio printed format===
Commercial sheet music is published in conjunction with the release of a new album (studio, compilation, soundtrack, etc.). A matching folio songbook is a compilation of the music notation of all the songs included in that particular album. It typically has the album&#x27;s artwork on its cover and, in addition to sheet music, it includes photos of the artist. Most pop and rock releases come in standard Piano/Vocal/Guitar notation format (and occasionally Easy Piano / E-Z Play Today). Rock-oriented releases may also come in Guitar Recorded Versions edition, which are note-for-note transcriptions written directly from artist recordings.

===Vinyl records===

Vinyl LP records have two sides, each comprising one-half of the album. If a pop or rock album contained tracks released separately as commercial singles, they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album. During the sixties, particularly in the UK, singles were generally released separately from albums. Today, many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles, which are released separately to radio, TV or the Internet as a way of promoting the album. Albums have been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together, such as singles not originally found on albums, b-sides of singles, or unfinished &quot;demo&quot; recordings.

Double albums during the seventies were sometimes sequenced for record changers. In the case of a two-record set, for example, sides 1 and 4 would be stamped on one record, and sides 2 and 3 on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer, with side 1 on the bottom and side 2 (on the other record) on top. Side 1 would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished, the tone arm&#x27;s position would trigger a mechanism which moved the arm out of the way, dropped the record with side 2, and played it. When both records had been played, the user would pick up the stack, turn it over, and put them back on the spindle—sides 3 and 4 would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era, but eventually fell out of use.

===8-track tape===

8-track tape (formally Stereo 8: commonly known as the eight-track cartridge, eight-track tape, or simply eight-track) is a magnetic tape sound recording technology popular in the United States from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over. The format is regarded as an obsolete technology, and was relatively unknown outside the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.

Stereo 8 was created in 1964 by a consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation, along with Ampex, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Motorola, and RCA Victor Records. It was a further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz. A later quadraphonic version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8, then later changed to just Q8.

===Compact cassette===

The Compact Cassette was a popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. The first &quot;Compact Cassette&quot; was introduced by Philips in August 1963 in the form of a prototype. Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman, which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size, the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with a clip for belts or pants.

The compact cassette used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; side of the tape, with cassette being &quot;turned&quot; to play the other side of the album. Compact Cassettes were also a popular way for musicians to record &quot;Demos&quot; or &quot;Demo Tapes&quot; of their music to distribute to various record labels, in the hopes of acquiring a recording contract.

Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes, which are tapes containing a compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on a mixtape generally relate to one another in some way, whether it be a conceptual theme or an overall sound. After the introduction of Compact discs, the term &quot;Mixtape&quot; began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.

The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s, after the release and distribution Compact Discs. The 2010s saw a revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who preferred the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet.

===Compact disc===

The compact disc format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums. After the introduction of music downloading and MP3 players such as the iPod, US album sales dropped 54.6% from 2001 to 2009. The CD is a digital data storage device which permits digital recording technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music.

===MP3 albums, and similar===

Most recently, the MP3 audio format has matured, revolutionizing the concept of digital storage. Early MP3 albums were essentially CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software, and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl.

The so-called &quot;MP3 album&quot; is not necessarily just in MP3 file format, in which higher quality formats such as FLAC and WAV can be used on storage media that MP3 albums reside on, such as CD-R-ROMs, hard drives, flash memory (e.g. thumbdrives, MP3 players, SD cards), etc.

==Types of album==
The contents of the album are usually recorded in a studio or live in concert, though may be recorded in other locations, such as at home (as with JJ Cale&#x27;s &quot;Okie&quot;, Beck&#x27;s &quot;Odelay&quot;, David Gray&#x27;s &quot;White Ladder&quot;, and others), in the field – as with early blues recordings, in prison, or with a mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio.

===Studio===
Most albums are &quot;studio albums&quot;—that is, they are recorded in a recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. Band members may record their parts in separate rooms or at separate times, listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right. In the 2000s, with the advent of digital recording, it became possible for musicians to record their part of a song in another studio in another part of the world, and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product.

===Live=== 

Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed &quot;live&quot;, even when done in a studio. However, the common understanding of a live album is one that was recorded at a concert with a public audience, even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked. Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at a single concert, or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause, laughter and other noise from the audience, comments by the performers between pieces, improvisation, and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system (rather than microphones placed among the audience), and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording.

Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman, &quot;The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert&quot;, released in 1950. Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said most &quot;are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction (you can&#x27;t put sights, smells, or fellowship on audio tape). But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena, the form makes a compelling kind of sense.&quot;

Among the best selling live albums are Eric Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; (1992), selling over 26 million copies, Garth Brooks&#x27; &quot;Double Live&quot; (1998), over 21 million copies, and Peter Frampton&#x27;s &quot;Frampton Comes Alive!&quot; (1976), over 11 million copies.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 18 albums were live albums.

===Solo=== 
A solo album, in popular music, is an album recorded by a current or former member of a musical group which is released under that artist&#x27;s name only, even though some or all other band members may be involved. The solo album appeared as early as the late 1940s. A 1947 &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine article heralded &quot;Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol&quot;. There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation a band member can solicit from other members of their band, and still have the album referred to as a solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr&#x27;s third venture, &quot;Ringo&quot;, &quot;[t]echnically... wasn&#x27;t a solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it&quot;. Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together.

A performer may record a solo album for several reasons. A solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band, be able to hire and fire accompanists, and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated, or that the group as a whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash of the Hollies described his experience in developing a solo album as follows: &quot;The thing that I go through that results in a solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that can&#x27;t be done, for whatever reason, by a lot of people&quot;. A solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group.

===Compilation album===

A compilation album is a collection of material from various recording projects or various artists, assembled with a theme such as the &quot;greatest hits&quot; from one artist, B-sides and rarities by one artist, or selections from a record label, a musical genre, a certain time period, or a regional music scene. Promotional sampler albums are compilations.

==== Tribute or cover ====

A tribute or cover album is a compilation of cover versions of songs or instrumental compositions. Its concept may involve various artists covering the songs of a single artist, genre or period, a single artist covering the songs of various artists or a single artist, genre or period, or any variation of an album of cover songs which is marketed as a &quot;tribute&quot;.

<doc id="528287" wikidata="Q499195" url="?curid=528287" title="Chad Trujillo">
<text>Chadwick A. Trujillo (born November 22, 1973) is an American astronomer, discoverer of minor planets and the co-discoverer of Eris, the most massive dwarf planet known in the Solar System.

Trujillo works with computer software and has examined the orbits of the numerous trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which is the outer area of the Solar System that he specialized in. In late August 2005, it was announced that Trujillo, along with Michael Brown and David Rabinowitz, had discovered Eris in 2003. As a result of the discovery of the satellite Dysnomia, Eris was the first TNO known to be more massive than Pluto.

==Career==
Trujillo attended Oak Park and River Forest High School in Oak Park, Illinois. He received his B.Sc. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995, and was a member of the Xi chapter of Tau Epsilon Phi, and received his Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Hawaiʻi in 2000.

Between 2000 and 2003 Trujillo was a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech. In 2003, he started working as an astronomer at the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii.

In 2013 Trujillo became head of the Adaptive Optics/Telescope Department at the Gemini Observatory, and continued until 2016. As of 2016, Trujillo is assistant professor at the department of Astronomy and Planetary Science at Northern Arizona University.

He studies the Kuiper belt and the outer Solar System.

==Discoveries==
Trujillo is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery and co-discovery of 54 numbered minor planets between 1996 and 2013, including many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) from the Kuiper belt &quot;(see table)&quot;. The last major TNO, Eris, was at first considered by him, his team, NASA, and many others to be the tenth planet, but the International Astronomical Union assigned it to the new classificatory category of dwarf planet.

The possible dwarf planets Trujillo discovered are:
*Quaoar, co-discovered with Brown
*Sedna, co-discovered with Brown and Rabinowitz, possibly the first known inner Oort cloud object
*Orcus, co-discovered with Brown and Rabinowitz
*Eris, co-discovered with Brown and Rabinowitz – the only known TNO more massive than Pluto
*, discovery also claimed by the Sierra Nevada Observatory, Spain &quot;(also see José Luis Ortiz Moreno)&quot;.
*, co-discovered with Brown and Rabinowitz in 2005, one of the first 5 official dwarf planets.

===List of discovered minor planets===
The Minor Planet Center credits Chad Trujillo with the discovery and co-discovery of 57 minor planets during 1996–2013. His numerous co-discoverers were: D. C. Jewitt, J. X. Luu, J. Chen, K. Berney, D. J. Tholen, M. E. Brown, W. Evans, S. S. Sheppard, D. L. Rabinowitz, A. Udalski, M. Kubiak, R. Poleski and Glenn Smith.




===Satellites and uncredited discoveries===
== Honors and awards ==
The main-belt asteroid 12101 Trujillo is named for him.

In 2006 he was named one of the Science Spectrum Magazine Trailblazer, top minority in science.

The institute was established in Baroda on 1 September 1927. It operated from the Central Library before it was shifted to a separate building near the palace. It is known for the seven volumes of the critical edition of &quot;Ramayana&quot; that it published between 1951 and 1975, a part of a 25-year project sponsored by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The text was later the reference source for &quot;Ramayan&quot;, the popular TV series by Ramanand Sagar that originally ran in 1987–88.

One of the oldest manuscripts preserved at the institute is &quot;Ayodhya Mahatmya&quot;, written by Harishankar in 1656 AD, part of the collection of over 10,000 manuscripts of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, who first conceptualized the institute in 1893, inspired by the opening of the Oriental Research Institute Mysore in 1891, established by then Maharaja of Mysore Chamaraja Wodeyar, and a close friend. A road was named after as Chamaraja Road in Vadodara and Sayajirao Road in Mysore to emmark the friendship between Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III and Chamaraja Wodeyar. Chamaraja Road starts from Eastern gate of Lakshmi Vilas Palace and has the prominent landmarks like Kirti Stambh, Khanderao Market and others before terminating near Bhagat Singh Chowk.

<doc id="528299" wikidata="Q933903" url="?curid=528299" title="St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk">
<text>St. Mary&#x27;s Church (Polish: &quot;Bazylika Mariacka&quot;, ) is a Roman Catholic church and co-cathedral located in central Gdańsk, Poland. Completed in 1502 in the Brick Gothic architectural style, it is one of the world&#x27;s largest brick churches and among the city&#x27;s most important landmarks, known to its inhabitants as the Crown of Gdańsk (Polish: &quot;Korona Gdańska&quot;). Together with Oliwa Cathedral, it serves the Archdiocese of Gdańsk. 

The groundbreaking ceremony took place in 1343, however, the construction of the present church began in 1379. St. Mary&#x27;s is an aisled hall church with a transept; its exterior was largely influenced by other churches and temples built across cities or townships in proximity to the Baltic Sea that were part of the Hanseatic League. Between 1536 and 1572, St. Mary&#x27;s Church was used for Catholic and Lutheran services simultaneously. Additionally, a domed side chapel in the Baroque fashion was erected for the Kings of Poland and Catholic worship in the late 17th century.

With a seating capacity of over 25,000 and a volume of approximately , it is one of the three largest brick churches ever constructed, along with San Petronio in Bologna and the Frauenkirche in Munich. It was also the second largest Lutheran church in the world from the 16th century until 1945. The structure is long, and the nave is wide; the total width of the church is . The internal height is estimated at at maximum point. 

== History ==

=== Beginnings, construction (14th–16th centuries) ===

According to tradition, as early as 1243 a wooden Church of the Assumption existed at this site, built by Swietopelk II, Duke of Pomerania.

The foundation stone for the new brick church was placed on 25 March 1343, the feast of the Annunciation. At first a six-span bay basilica with a low turret was built, erected from 1343 to 1360. Parts of the pillars and lower levels of the turret have been preserved from this building.

In 1379 the Gdańsk architect Heinrich Ungeradin and his team began construction of the present church. Their building shows some differences from St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Lübeck, sometimes called the mother of all Brick Gothic churches dedicated to St. Mary in Hanseatic cities around the Baltic, and it has some details in common with Gothic brick churches in Flanders and the Netherlands. By 1447 the eastern part of the church was finished, and the tower was raised by two floors in the years 1452–1466. From 1485 the work was continued by Hans Brandt, who supervised the erection of the main nave core. After 1496, the structure was finally finished under Heinrich Haetzl, who supervised the construction of the vaulting.

=== Reformation (16th century) ===

In the course of the Reformation most people of Gdańsk adopted Lutheranism, among them the parishioners of St. Mary&#x27;s. After a short wave of turbulent religious altercations in 1525 and 1526, in which the previous city council was overthrown, the new authorities favored a smooth transition to Lutheran religious practice. In 1529 the first Lutheran sermon was given in St. Mary&#x27;s. From 1536 — in cooperation with Włocławek&#x27;s Catholic officials — a Lutheran cleric was permanently employed at St. Mary&#x27;s and both Lutheran services and Catholic masses were held. The Lutheran congregation then began registering personal data, and the oldest surviving register is that of burials starting in 1537.

In July 1557, King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland granted Gdańsk the religious privilege of celebrating communion with both bread and wine. Thereafter the City Council ended Catholic masses in all Gdańsk churches except St. Mary&#x27;s, where Catholic masses continued until 1572. As part of the smooth transition Lutheran pastors and services at first also continued Catholic traditions, including using precious liturgical garments, such as chasubles. However Catholic traditions gradually were abandoned at St. Mary&#x27;s. Gdańsk&#x27;s Lutheran congregation, like others in northern Europe, stored the old liturgical garments, some of which survived.

The inventories of St. Mary&#x27;s reflect usage of Catholic-style accessories in Gdańsk&#x27;s early Lutheran services. The inventory of 1552 still mentions a great stock of garments and embroideries. The parishioners of St. Mary&#x27;s formed a Lutheran congregation which - as part of Lutheran church polity - adopted a church order. A more elaborate church order (constitution) followed in 1612, the &quot;Alte kirchenordnung&quot;. The first senior pastor (&quot;Erster Pfarrer, pastor primarius&quot;) of Gdańsk&#x27;s Lutheran state church was Johannes Kittelius, pastor at St. Mary&#x27;s between 1566 and 1590. The church officially was called Supreme Parish Church of St. Mary&#x27;s (Oberpfarrkirche St. Marien), indicating its prominent position in the city.

=== Dispute with Kings of Poland ===

Due to the anti-Bathory rebellion, in 1577 the Polish King Stephen Báthory imposed the Siege of Gdańsk (1577). The defense of its political position forced the city to hire mercenaries, who were so costly that the City Council confiscated gold and silver from the inhabitants and from the treasuries of the city and its Lutheran state church. Most of the gold and silver utensils of St. Mary&#x27;s were melted down and minted to pay the mercenaries. An inventory of 1552 still recorded no less than 78 silver gilt chalices, 43 altar crucifixes, 24 great silver figures of saints and the like more. After 1577 most of it was gone. The Gdańsk rebellion ended in December 1577 with a compromise forcing the city to pay the king the sum of 200,000 florins. But the Polish monarch also recognised Gdańsk&#x27;s religious freedom and Lutheran faith. As a compromise the jurisdiction over Gdańsk&#x27;s Lutherans as to marital and sexual matters remained with Włocławek&#x27;s Catholic officials.

In 1594, the Polish royal court tribunal attempted to restore Catholic services to St. Mary&#x27;s, but the City Council rejected that approach. But as a compromise, since the Catholic kings of Poland had been the nominal heads of the City since the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the Council authorised building the Baroque Catholic Royal Chapel. It was erected by Tylman van Gameren (Gamerski) and completed in 1681, near St. Mary&#x27;s Church, for the king&#x27;s Catholic service when he visited Gdańsk. With St. Mary&#x27;s pastor Constantin Schütz (1646–1712) a moderate pietist theology replaced the previously dominant Lutheran orthodoxy.

=== Partitions, Prussia, Germany (1793–1920) ===

In the course of the Partitions of Poland the city lost its autonomy in 1793, regaining it for a short period (1807–1814) as a Napoleonic client state, before it became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1815. The Prussian government integrated St. Mary&#x27;s and all the Lutheran state church into the all-Prussian Lutheran church administration. In 1816 the Gdańsk Consistory was established taking on the tasks and some of the members of the Gdańsk spiritual ministerium. Gdańsk&#x27;s then senior, and prime pastor at St. Mary&#x27;s (1801–1827), Karl Friedrich Theodor Bertling, became a consistorial councillor in the church body. In 1817 the government imposed the union of Reformed and Lutheran congregations within the entire kingdom. First intended to win all these congregations to adopt a unified Protestant confession, the vast Lutheran majority insisted on retaining the Augsburg Confession, thus St. Mary&#x27;s remained a Lutheran church and congregation, but joined the new umbrella of the Evangelical Church in Prussia in 1821, a regional Protestant church body of united administration but no common confession, comprising mostly Lutheran, but also some Reformed and united Protestant congregations.

In 1820, during Bertling&#x27;s pastorate, long forgotten chests and cabinets in the sacristy were opened and the first medieval garments and liturgical decorations were rediscovered. In the 1830s more historic garments were found. At that time the congregation did not grasp the richness and rarity of these findings. So when Chaplain Franz Johann Joseph Bock, art historian and curator of the then Cologne Archdiocesan Museum, reviewed the discoveries he acquired a number of the best pieces from the congregation. Bock showed them in an exhibition in 1853. After his death some Gdańsk pieces from his personal collection were sold to London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum. These and also later sales to private collectors included cloths and vestments made of fabrics from ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, obtained during the Crusades; as well as renaissance wares from Venice, Florence and Lucca (more than 1000 items altogether).

In 1861–64 a Sexton named Hinz systematically searched chests, cabinets and other storages in chambers and rooms, also in the tower, and found many more historic liturgical garments. In the 1870s and 1880s the congregation sold more than 200 incomplete pieces, but also intact altar cloths and embroideries to the Berlin Museum of Decorative Arts. The remaining pieces of the garment collection, the so-called &quot;Danziger Paramentenschatz&quot; (Gdańsk Parament Treasure), mostly originate from the 150 years between 1350 and 1500.

The congregation also sold other artifacts, such as the winged triptych by Jan van Wavere, acquired by Archduke Maximilian, now held in the Church of the Teutonic Order in Vienna, and the sculpture of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; by Michael of Augsburg from the main altar, sold to Count Alfons Sierakowski, now in the chapel in Waplewo Wielkie. In addition, the Prussian authorities melted down gold and silver reliquaries for reuse.

=== Free City, World War II (1920–1945) ===

Until World War II, the church interior and exterior were well preserved. Between 1920 and 1940 St. Mary&#x27;s became the principal church within the Protestant Regional Synodal Federation of the Free City of Danzig. In this time the presbytery (board of the congregation) discerned the value of its parament collection and prompted its cataloguing. During a renovation in the 1920s more historic garments and altar cloths were found. From 1930 to 1933 Walter Mannowsky, then director of the City Museum (now housed in the National Museum, Gdańsk), delivered a detailed four volume inventory of the &quot;Paramentenschatz&quot;. It was then presented in the St. Barbara Chapel of St. Mary&#x27;s. In 1936 the &quot;Paramentenschatz&quot; was moved to a newly equipped room in the City Museum with a controlled climate, since the Barbara Chapel was too damp. The &quot;Paramentenschatz&quot; remained property of the congregation, presented on loan in the city museum (&quot;Stadtmuseum&quot;).

Beginning in the third war year 1942, major items of Gdańsk&#x27;s cultural heritage were dismantled and demounted in coordination with the cultural heritage curator (&quot;Konservator&quot;). The presbytery of St. Mary&#x27;s Church agreed to remove items like archive files and artworks such as altars, paintings, epitaphs, mobile furnishings to places outside the city. Meanwhile, churches in Gdańsk as elsewhere in Germany, and in German-occupied areas, saw their church bells requisitioned as non-ferrous metal for war production. Bells were classified according to historical and/or artistical value and those categorised the least valuable and cast after 1860, and especially those requisitioned in occupied areas, were melted down the first.

The church was severely damaged late in World War II, during the storming of Gdańsk city by the Red Army in March 1945. The wooden roof burned completely and most of the ceiling fell in. Fourteen of the large vaults collapsed. The windows were destroyed. In places the heat was so intense that some of the bricks melted, especially in the upper parts of the tower, which acted as a giant chimney. All remaining bells crashed down when their bell cages collapsed in the fire. The floor of the church, containing priceless gravestone slabs, was torn apart, allegedly by Soviet soldiers attempting to loot the corpses buried underneath.

By the end of the Second World War many German parishioners of St. Mary&#x27;s fled westwards, and also the parament treasure was evacuated to the west. In March 1945 Poland began expelling the remaining ethnic Germans in the city even before the border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference reassigned the city to Poland. Most of St. Mary&#x27;s surviving parishioners wound up in the British occupation zone in northern Germany. Lübeck became a center for exiled Germans. All property of St. Mary&#x27;s Lutheran congregation in Gdańsk was expropriated and its cemetery despoiled. However, two unsmelted bells of St. Mary&#x27;s, dating from 1632 and 1719, later were found in the so-called Hamburg bell cemetery (Glockenfriedhof). Of the prewar chimes, there still exist two bells, after restitution to the congregation loaned by its presbytery exiled in Lübeck to other congregations in northern Germany. &quot;Osanna&quot; from 1632 can be found in St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Hildesheim, and &quot;Dominicalis&quot; from 1719 can be found under the name &quot;Osanna&quot; in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Lübeck, both in Germany. &quot;Dominicalis&quot; is used by the congregation of Lutheran St. Mary&#x27;s Church, and the parament treasure is on public display.

=== Post-war Poland (1945–present) ===

Gdańsk was gradually repopulated by more Poles, and Polish authorities handed over St. Mary&#x27;s Church to the Catholic diocese. Most of the artworks from the interior survived, having been evacuated for safekeeping to villages near the city. Many of these have returned to the church, but some are displayed in various museums around Poland. The diocese has sought to secure their return.

The reconstruction started shortly after the war in 1946. The roof was rebuilt in August 1947, using reinforced concrete. After the basic reconstruction was finished, the church was reconsecrated on November 17, 1955. The reconstruction and renovation of the interior is an ongoing effort.

On November 20, 1965, by papal bull, Pope Paul VI elevated the church to the dignity of the basilica. On February 2, the Congregation for Bishops established the &quot;Bazylika Mariacka&quot; as the Gdańsk Co-Cathedral in the then still non-metropolitan Catholic Diocese of Gdańsk. Since 1925 the Oliwa Cathedral is the cathedral of the diocese (elevated to archdiocese in 1992).

The funeral of Paweł Adamowicz, the assassinated Mayor of Gdańsk, took place at the basilica on 19 January 2019.

In 2020, the 15th-century Gothic &quot;Pietas Domini&quot; altar, which was stolen by Germany during World War II, was restored to the church from Berlin.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
St. Mary&#x27;s Church is a triple-aisled hall church with a triple-aisled transept. Both the transept and the main nave are of similar width and height. Certain irregularities in the form of the northern arm of the transept are remnants of the previous church situated on the same site. In all, the building is a good example of late Gothic architecture.

The vaulting is a true piece of art. Much of it was restored after World War II. Main nave, transept and presbytery are covered by net vaults, while the aisles are covered by diamond vaults. The exterior of the nave is dominated by plain brick walls and high and narrow pointed arch windows. Such a construction was possible by placing corbels and buttresses inside of the church and erecting chapels between them. Similar constructions have been used in Albi Cathedral (1287–1487, Southern France) and Munich Frauenkirche (1468–1494). The gables are divided by a set of brick pinnacles. All corners are accentuated by turrets crowned by metal headpieces (reconstructed after 1970). Similar turrets can be found on the town hall of Lübeck as well as on the two large Churches of Leiden and on the Ridderzaal in The Hague.

The church is stabilized by strong buttresses and has seven portals – one in the west under the steeple, one in the eastern façade of the choir, two on the northern and three on the southern side. Six of the portals (all except the western) are of sandstone masonry.

===Interior===

The church is decorated within with several masterpieces of Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque painting. The most notable, &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; by Flemish painter Hans Memling, is currently preserved in the National Museum of Gdańsk. Other works of art were transferred to the National Museum in Warsaw in 1945. It was not until the 1990s when several of them were returned to the church. The most notable parts of internal decoration are:

* &quot;Jerusalem Altar&quot;, 1495–1500 (currently in the National Museum in Warsaw)
* High Altar, 1511–1517, Michael of Augsburg
* &quot;Ten Commandments&quot;, approx. 1485
* Gravestone of Simon and Judith Bahr, 1614–1620, Abraham van den Blocke
* Pietà, approx. 1420
* Holy Mother of God sculpture, approx. 1420
* Gdańsk astronomical clock, 1464–1470, Hans Düringer of Nuremberg, reconstructed after 1945
* Organ set, partially transferred from St. John&#x27;s church in 1985.

== Bells ==
There are two bells in St Mary&#x27;s Church. Both of them were cast in 1970 by foundry Felczyński in Przemyśl. The larger one is called &quot;Gratia Dei&quot;, weighs , and sounds in nominal F sharp. The smaller bell is the so-called &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, weighs , and sounds in C sharp.

Its inhabitants are called &quot;Lavallois&quot;. The commune of Laval proper, without the metropolitan area, is the 7th most populous in the Pays de la Loire region and the 132nd in France.

A part of the traditional province of Maine before the French Revolution, which now split between two departments, Mayenne and Sarthe, Laval also lies on the threshold of Brittany and is not far from Normandy and Anjou. It was thus an important stronghold in northwestern France during the Middle Ages. Laval became a city during the 11th century, and was the cradle of the House of Laval, one of the most powerful families in Maine and Brittany. The counts of Laval developed a textile industry around 1300 and made Laval a significant centre for the French Renaissance a century later. The linen industry remained the principal activity in Laval until the 20th century, when milk processing became more profitable.

Laval developed around a promontory, on which the castle was built, and along the river Mayenne. The Laval metropolitan area is a small economic centre in western France, particularly active in the industrial sector, dairy production, electronics and chemicals. Laval is economically oriented towards Rennes, the administrative capital of the region of Brittany, and located only west of Laval.

Laval proper covers and has a population of 49,573 inhabitants, while c. 144,000 live in its metropolitan area (). The Laval Agglomération intercommunality is made up of 34 communes covering with 113,000 inhabitants.

Laval is notably the birthplace of Henri Rousseau, a major Naïve painter, and the town has a museum dedicated to him and other Naïve artists. Laval also enjoys a significant architectural heritage, with its castle, portions of city walls, medieval houses, old bridges and churches.

==Toponymy==
Laval is a relatively new foundation in comparison to other French cities. That is to say that the borough was not officially mentioned prior to the 11th century. According to legend glorifying the Counts of Laval, mediaeval chroniclers portrayed the citizens of Laval as being the offspring of Charles Martel&#x27;s grandson Wala of Corbie. By virtue of the chroniclers&#x27; accounts, &quot;Laval&quot; should be a synonym for &quot;Vala&quot; or &quot;Valla&quot;—the two spelling variants of &quot;Wala&quot;.

Etymologically spoken, however, the name of &quot;Laval&quot;, in all likelihood, merely stands for &quot;the valley&quot; in French (&quot;la vallée&quot; in contemporary language), to capture the lush valley of the Mayenne river, wherein &quot;Laval&quot; is situated. This name commonly appears in other French location names, sometimes with a second word, such as in &quot;Laval-d&#x27;Aurelle&quot; (Ardèche) or &quot;Laval-sur-Doulon&quot; (Haute-Loire).

The first mention of the town was the Latin &quot;Vallis Guidonis&quot;, meaning &quot;Guy&#x27;s valley&quot;, because the counts of Laval were all called &quot;Guy&quot;. On its side, the castle was usually named &quot;Castrum Guidonis&quot; or &quot;Aula Guidonis&quot; (&quot;Guy&#x27;s castle&quot; and &quot;Guy&#x27;s palace&quot;). During the 11th century, Laval is also called &quot;Castrum Vallis&quot; or simply &quot;Vallis&quot;; and &quot;Lavallis&quot; appears in 1080. Other Latin names include &quot;Valles&quot; and &quot;Castrum de Valibus&quot;. &quot;Lavallum Guidonis&quot; is first written in 1239. After the Renaissance, &quot;Lavallis&quot; and &quot;Lavallium&quot; are both commonly used by the clergy and the scholars.

As in Latin, the name evolved in French from &quot;Laval-Guion&quot; or &quot;Laval-Guyon&quot; to &quot;Laval&quot; in one single word. Laval is one of the few cities in the world to have a palindrome as a name, as &quot;Laval&quot; can be read the same way in either direction.

==Geography==

===Location===

Laval is located at the geographical centre of the Mayenne department, on the road which connects Paris to Brittany, between Rennes and Le Mans. The town is situated on the middle course of the Mayenne, a river which has its source in Normandy and runs towards the Loire crossing the Mayenne department from North to South.

Laval is located approximately from Rennes, from Le Mans and Angers, from Nantes, from Tours, from Caen and from Paris. It is also far from Le Mont-Saint-Michel and the surrounding sea resorts, located on the English Channel.

Elevation varies between 42 and 122 meters above sea level. Laval is, in fact, a hilly town, marked by a rocky promontory dominating the valley of the Mayenne river. The castle was built on this promontory and the medieval centre spreads around. The promontory and the slightly hilly landscape around Laval are traces of the Armorican Massif, an old range of mountains that forms the Breton peninsula.

The town is surrounded by agricultural land essentially made of large fields. The traditional bocage with its old hedgerows is still partially visible. Laval is also surrounded by several forests, such as the &quot;Forêt de Concise&quot;, with c. 600 hectares, and the &quot;Bois de l&#x27;Huisserie&quot;, with 254 hectares. Both are located south of the town.
===Metropolitan area===
The commune of Laval is bordered by seven other communes. These are, clockwise, Changé, Bonchamp-lès-Laval, Forcé, Entrammes, L&#x27;Huisserie, Montigné-le-Brillant and Saint-Berthevin. Saint-Berthevin forms part of the agglomeration, and Changé and Bonchamp-lès-Laval are well integrated, but the other communes remain rural areas with villages and hamlets. 26 other communes situated farther form with them the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération Laval Agglomération. They unite c. 113,000 inhabitants.

===Climate===
Laval enjoys a very mild climate because of its proximity with the Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel, giving it an oceanic climate. Winters are usually wet, with scarce frosts and snowfalls, and summers are warm and sunny, although rainfalls are common.

===Urban morphology===

The oldest streets and buildings in Laval are located around the promontory where the castle stands. The urban structure there dates back from the Middle Ages and is limited to the western bank of the Mayenne river. This old core is today the main shopping area, with several pedestrian streets and little shops. Several medieval half-timbered houses are still visible, but most of the buildings are dating from the 18th and 19th centuries and are made of tufa.

The suburb of Avesnières, located one kilometer () south of the castle, is a former commune which merged with Laval in 1863. Founded in 1073, it still comprises several old houses and a medieval basilica. Other large medieval hamlets absorbed by the town include Le Bourg Hersend and Saint-Martin. The eastern bank of the Mayenne was also settled in the Middle Ages, along the street that leads to the bridge crossing the river, but it was mostly developed during the second half of the 19th century when the train station was built there. The old faubourgs surrounding the town centre date from the same period and are mainly composed of individual houses.

The 20th-century suburbs comprise some council estates but individual houses are much more common. Some shopping centres and several industrial areas are located on the outskirts of the town. Laval is encircled by a small ring road and the Paris-Rennes highway bypasses the town by the North.

Until the 20th century, Laval had had a port on the Mayenne river, which was surrounded by several factories, mainly linen manufactures. The old industrial areas were redeveloped after 1970 and the river has since become a recreational area.

===Green areas===

Laval is a small town and nature is not far away from the centre. The town manages 25 hectares of parks and gardens, and 200 hectares of green areas in total.

The largest park is the &quot;Jardin de la Perrine&quot;, located in the centre, at the top of a rocky promontory. Formerly a private garden, it encircles an 18th-century mansion and comprises a French and an English garden as well as a rose garden, an orangery and a small menagerie. This park encompasses 4,5 hectares. Henri Rousseau, a major Naïve artist born in Laval, is buried there.

Apart from the Jardin de la Perrine, the main green areas in the centre are the &quot;Square de Boston&quot;, refurbished in 2012, and the &quot;Square Foch&quot;, located on the &quot;place du 11-Novembre&quot;, which is the central point of the town.

The commune of Laval owns the &quot;Bois Gamats&quot;, a 25 hectares wood located on the southern hedge of the town. The neighbouring &quot;Bois de l&#x27;Huisserie&quot;, much bigger, is managed by Laval Agglomération.

==History==

===Heraldry===

The coat of arms of Laval is: &quot;gules, a lion passant guardant&quot;. The coat of arms were those of the House of Laval, and not to the city. Still, several members of the family permitted the town to use their arms, notably in 1211, when the direct branch died, and in 1464.

The House of Laval had a motto, &quot;Eadem mensura&quot; (&quot;of same measure&quot;), which is sometimes associated with the town of Laval.

In 1987, the municipality adopted a logotype, replaced in 2010 by a new one which uses the heraldic lion as well as the palindrome as the two symbols of Laval. This logotype is made of &quot;Laval&quot; written in capital letters, with the final &quot;L&quot; held by the lion and reversed to suggest the palindrome.

===Middle Ages===

Before the construction of the castle during the 11th century, Laval did not exist. However, the site of the town was already a thoroughfare because it was located on the Roman road that connected Le Mans to Corseul, a provincial capital in present-day Brittany. Moreover, some parts of the city territory had been settled by the Gauls. For instance, a Gallic stele has been unearthed in the suburb of Pritz, north of the centre. The chapel of Pritz was on its side first mentioned in 710. The body of Tudwal, a Breton Saint, is believed to have been brought to Laval in 870 or 878, during a Norman invasion in Brittany.
The site of Laval had a strategic importance because the travelers taking the Roman road had to cross there the Mayenne river on a ford. The western bank of the river was further dominated by a rocky promontory which could ensure a total control on the ford. During the 10th century, a first military structure was built on it, and a villa was mentioned there at the end of the century in a charter issued by the count of Maine. Around 1020, Herbert I of Maine offered the new barony of Laval to Guy I, who became the first lord of the town. Guy I of Laval built a new castle and the town slowly appeared around the Roman road and on the river banks.

The castle built by Guy I was much wider than the present-day structure. It was encircled by an earthen wall and it spread from the present-day keep to the cathedral. A motte built over the wall commanded the access to the top of the promontory, where the Lords lived, and the second motte was probably located inside the compound. The basilica in Avesnières, located several kilometers south of the castle, was founded in the 12th century by Guy III. Around 1200, the earthen wall was pulled down and the castle became smaller, taking its present-day appearance. The town developed on its side its own defense system.

Beatrix of Gavere, the wife of Guy IX de Laval, who lived in the 13th century, is believed to be at the origin of the textile tradition of the town. Born in Flanders, she would have brought Flemish weavers with her, and would have encouraged linen production. Linen weaving remained the main economic activity of the town until the 19th century.

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the town was taken by the English commanded by John Talbot, in 1428. It became French again a year later. The fighting occasioned great damages and the town was fully rebuilt afterwards. Thus all the half-timbered houses that still stand in the medieval centre were not built before the 15th century. During that period, the town&#x27;s walls were completed by the addition of a powerful artillery fort in an innovative design, known as the &quot;Tour Renaise&quot;. Around 1450, Guy XIV de Laval had the castle refurbished. New rooms and halls were built, and new Gothic windows were opened on the courtyard at the beginning of the 16th century.

===Modern period===

Guy XVII built a Renaissance gallery in extension to the castle around 1542. The gallery was later slightly redecorated in 1747. Guy XVII was a member of the Court of Francis I, one of the greatest kings of the French Renaissance. The House of Laval played a certain role in the development of the Renaissance arts in the region. Jean of Laval-Châteaubriant built for instance a large palace at the château de Châteaubriant, located in Brittany. On his side, Guy XIX became a Huguenot.

During the 17th century, Laval became very prosperous and the Counter-Reformation led to the foundation of many religious institutions. Large convents were opened, including Ursulines, Benedictines and Capuchins. All these convents were later sold and demolished during the French Revolution. During the 18th century, the town, which had kept its medieval appearance, started to expand. New faubourgs appeared, and the local aristocracy built there many elegant hôtels particuliers, particularly around the &quot;place de Hercé&quot;, which became the most fashionable area of Laval.

In the middle of the 18th century, Laval had around 18,000 inhabitants and 3,525 households. It was the second most populous town in Maine, after Le Mans. It enjoyed several institutions, such as a présidial, an office of the ferme générale, a local jurisdiction, a hospital, a gendarmery and a city hall. Laval was also at the head of a pays d&#x27;élection (fiscal region) encompassing 65 parishes in southern Maine. Because it was located close to the Breton border, Laval had a large salt storehouse, which controlled the collect of the gabelle, a tax on salt. Because Brittany was a large salt producer, it was exempted from gabelle, but people living in Maine, or other hinterland provinces, had to buy a certain amount of salt every year, thus paying the gabelle was compulsory for them. A salt storehouse such as the one in Laval was therefore a tax office and it had to deal with salt contraband. 26 fairs were held each year in the pays d&#x27;élection, and three markets were held in the town. At that time Laval was made up of three parishes.
The textile industry in Laval reached its zenith just before the French Revolution. The town had the right to produce eight sorts of cloth, including the &quot;royales&quot; and &quot;demi-Hollande&quot;, which were among the finest linen weaved in France. The neighbouring towns of Mayenne and Château-Gontier also had the right to produce linen, but in only three or four kinds of cloth.

The &quot;royales&quot; and &quot;demi-Hollande&quot; were the best linen of Laval, as well as the most expensive. A &quot;demi-Hollande&quot; could cost up to 700 pounds, and a &quot;toile forte&quot;, the cheapest one, had a worth of 50 pounds. The other sorts of linen made in Laval were also cheap and of a low quality, but they represented the largest share of the total production. The linen of Laval were sold mainly in France, but also abroad. The rustic &quot;non-battues&quot; were only made for the Spanish market, some of the best linen were sold in Portugal and the stronger clothes were exported to the French colonies in America. The &quot;royales&quot; and the &quot;demi-Hollande&quot; were usually sold in Troyes, Senlis and Beauvais, three towns located around Paris, which were renowned for their markets. Laval also produced a specific kind of linen, the &quot;pontivy&quot;, for the French army.

In the 18th century, the old medieval centre was still encircled by city walls, and its narrow plots and streets forbade any large urban transformation. However, the authorities planned to build a large thoroughfare bypassing the centre by the north. That involved the construction of a new bridge on the Mayenne river, because at that time Laval only had one, which was small and very old. The project was validated in 1758, but works did not start before 1804. The idea of a new axis was important not only for the town, but also for the whole region, because Laval was on the road between Paris and Brittany. Every traveler taking that road had to cross the Mayenne river on the old bridge, and to cross the insalubrious and narrow walled town.

The War in the Vendée, which opposed French revolutionaries and Royalist Catholics during the last decade of the 18th century, started in the &quot;département&quot; of Vendée, located south of the Loire, but it quickly spread in Brittany, Anjou and Maine, which were Catholic strongholds. Laval, which had been under the control of the revolutionaries since 1789, was seized by the Royalists 22 October 1793. The town was on their itinerary to the English Channel, where they were waiting for reinforcement. However, the expedition to Normandy was a total failure, and they were defeated there by the Republican army. The Royalists came back to Laval 25 December 1793, but they lost a siege in Angers and were definitely defeated in 1794.
===Contemporary period===

After the French Revolution, the local authorities decided to achieve the master plan planned in the 18th century. The new bridge was completed in 1824 and the new East-West axis, bypassing the old centre by the North, was developed during the 1820s and 1830s. A new town centre emerged on the axis, and a new square was built close to the bridge. Several official buildings were constructed around, including a new city hall, the préfecture and a theatre. Around the new bridge, the Mayenne river was deviated to form a straight waterway, and new quays were built between 1844 and 1863. After 1850, major works were carried in the medieval centre: several new streets were built and the square in front of the castle was enlarged. In 1855, Laval obtained a diocese and a railway station. That year, trains coming from Paris had their terminus in Laval, but the line was further extended towards Brittany in 1856.

Laval experienced a significant demographic growth throughout the 19th century. It had 15,000 inhabitants around 1800, and that figure rose to 21,293 in 1861. Two years later, the neighbouring communes of Avesnières and Grenoux were absorbed into Laval, together with parts of Changé. As a consequence of this amalgamation, Laval counted 27,000 inhabitants by 1863. In 1866, the town numbered 30,627 inhabitants, but then it experienced a slight decline which lasted until the end of the Second World War. This decline was due to both socio-economical and geopolitical factors: 
* the decline of the textile industry: At the beginning of the 19th century, linen prices dropped, and the region stopped to produce flax. Instead, the factories in Laval imported cotton, but process costs were too high for the activity to be profitable.
* the invasions by Germany and ensuing costs caused by these invasions, both in terms reparations and the human misery.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Laval had several institutions, such as courts of justice, a chamber of commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, a seminary and a secondary school for boys. The declining textile industry was still employing 10,000 hands in Laval and its suburbs. Other activities included metal-founding, flour-milling, tanning, dyeing, the making of boots and shoes, and the sawing of marble.

During the Second World War, Laval was occupied by Nazi Germany. The town was bombed several times by the Allies in June and July 1944. The train station and the surrounding area, as well as the viaduct and some streets in the centre were heavily damaged. General Patton&#x27;s troops arrived in Laval 6 August 1944. The German occupiers did not surrender immediately, and they destroyed the bridges before leaving the town at around 3pm.

After the war, Laval experienced a quick industrialisation. Most of the old cloth factories were closed down and the town developed instead a large food processing sector, particularly dairies. It also developed plastics processing and car manufacturing. During that period, the town quickly expanded and several new institutions were built, such as a campus and a new hospital.

== Population ==

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Laval proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Laval absorbed the former communes of Notre-Dame-d&#x27;Avenières and Grenoux (partly) in 1863.

== Education ==

The city counts 27 primary schools (écoles primaires), 8 middle schools (collèges) and 7 high schools (lycées).

Some institutions also provide higher education in Laval like :
* ESTACA
* ESIEA (university)
* Le Mans University
* Catholic University of the West

==Economy==
The town is historically a manufacturer of fine linens, but there are also foundries. Laval is also home to the Laval and Mayenne Technology Park, where firms working in electronics, computing and peripherals, food technology, veterinary pharmaceuticals, virtual reality, audiovisual productions, patents, marketing and a resource centre are all to be found in modern buildings.

It is also an important centre for the dairy industry and produces cheeses, ultra-high-temperature processing milk, and yoghurt. It is the headquarters of Lactalis.

There is a market in the town centre every Tuesday and Saturday, held near the former &quot;Palais de Justice&quot;.

==Transport==

===Railway===

The Laval railway station offers regional connections with Le Mans, Rennes, Angers, and Nantes with TER Pays de la Loire and long range connections to the main cities of the country like Paris, Strasbourg or Lille with TGV.

===Roads===

The motorway A81 passes just in the north of Laval, linking the city to Paris and Brittany. Several other main roads cross in Laval which gives the city direct roads to Rennes, Le Mans, Angers, Tours and Nantes.

===Public transport===

The bus network operating in Laval is called TUL (Transports Urbains Lavallois). It is made of 17 urban lines for the city of Laval and its close suburb, including 4 which work from Monday to Sunday.

Laval also has a bicycle-sharing system called Vélitul.

==Administration==

==Main sights==

* Medieval Château de Laval (tower and building)
* Significant remains of the town walls and of a town gate. The town came together around the foundation of the castle in 1020 in its position in the march, the border lands between France and Brittany. It was built for Guy I of Dénéré who became a vassal of the Count of Maine. at the end of the 12th century, local troubles combined with the town&#x27;s position on the road into Brittany led the lord of Laval to build a great round keep which still has its original hoarding. At first the town was composed of scattered settlements such as the &quot;bourg cheverel&quot; and the &quot;bourg hersent&quot;. However, from the time of the new castle, it grew rapidly. It was enclosed in ramparts from the 13th century. There were five gates in the walls of which the sole one remaining is the &quot;porte Beucheresse&quot; or gate of the woodcutters.
* Cathedral of the Trinity (&quot;La Trinité&quot;). Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque characteristically, it has rich wall paintings and figurative stone carving but the general architectural style of the buildings is restrained. In Laval, that architectural sobriety was retained through the early Gothic period. The painting can be seen well in the calendars in &quot;Notre-Dame de Pritz, Saint-Martin&quot;, and &quot;Saint-Pierre-le-Potier&quot;. The architecture shows best at &quot;Grenoux&quot;, and &quot;Avesnières&quot;; while the stone carving is well displayed in the zoomorphic column capitals at &quot;Avesnières&quot;. The early Gothic, what in England would be called Early English but in Laval is Angevin Gothic, is to be seen in &quot;la Trinité&quot;. Here we are close to Anjou, the home of the Angevin kings of England beginning with Henry II. In the Cathedral, on the effigy tomb of the bishop Louis Bougaud (1888), the following inscription may be read:
:HEIC IN PACE QVIE SCIT
:LUDOVICVS BOVGAVD EPISCOPUS VALLEGVIDONENSIS DECESSIT VII IDVS NOVEMB AN MDCCCLXXXVIII (1888)
:ANNOS NATVS LXV.M.V.III.D.VII
:VIVAS IN DEO
*The &quot;Jardin botanique de la Perrine&quot;, a botanical garden and park
*The Hôtel de Ville was completed in 1831.

==Arts==
The town has obtained the label Ville d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire from the fact of its rich heritage.

As a response to the Douanier Rousseau&#x27;s having been born in Laval, there is a biennial festival of naive art, the &quot;Biennale Internationale d&#x27;Art naïf de Laval&quot;. It seeks to explore the course of modern primitivism. Pictures are brought from all round Europe.

<doc id="528305" wikidata="Q4344853" url="?curid=528305" title="Bertrand paradox (economics)">
<text>In economics and commerce, the Bertrand paradox — named after its creator, Joseph Bertrand — describes a situation in which two players (firms) reach a state of Nash equilibrium where both firms charge a price equal to marginal cost (&quot;MC&quot;). The paradox is that in models such as Cournot competition, an increase in the number of firms is associated with a convergence of prices to marginal costs. In these alternative models of oligopoly, a small number of firms earn positive profits by charging prices above cost.
Suppose two firms, A and B, sell a homogeneous commodity, each with the same cost of production and distribution, so that customers choose the product solely on the basis of price. It follows that demand is infinitely price-elastic. Neither A nor B will set a higher price than the other because doing so would yield the entire market to their rival. If they set the same price, the companies will share both the market and profits.

On the other hand, if either firm were to lower its price, even a little, it would gain the whole market and substantially larger profits. Since both A and B know this, they will each try to undercut their competitor until the product is selling at zero economic profit. This is the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Recent work has shown that there may be an additional mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium with positive economic profits under the assumption that monopoly profits are infinite. For the case of finite monopoly profits, it has been shown that positive profits under price competition are impossible in mixed equilibria and even in the more general case of correlated equilibria.

The Bertrand paradox rarely appears in practice because real products are almost always differentiated in some way other than price (brand name, if nothing else); firms have limitations on their capacity to manufacture and distribute, and two firms rarely have identical costs.

Bertrand&#x27;s result is paradoxical because if the number of firms goes from one to two, the price decreases from the monopoly price to the competitive price and stays at the same level as the number of firms increases further. This is not very realistic, as in reality, markets featuring a small number of firms with market power typically charge a price in excess of marginal cost. The empirical analysis shows that in most industries with two competitors, positive profits are made. Solutions to the Paradox attempt to derive solutions that are more in line with solutions from the Cournot model of competition, where two firms in a market earn positive profits that lie somewhere between the perfectly competitive and monopoly levels.

Some reasons the Bertrand paradox do not strictly apply:

* &quot;Capacity constraints&quot;. Sometimes firms do not have enough capacity to satisfy all demand. This was a point first raised by Francis Edgeworth and gave rise to the Bertrand–Edgeworth model.
* &quot;Integer pricing&quot;. Prices higher than MC are ruled out because one firm can undercut another by an arbitrarily small amount. If prices are discrete (for example have to take integer values) then one firm has to undercut the other by at least one cent. This implies that the price one cent above MC is now an equilibrium: if the other firm sets the price one cent above MC, the other firm can undercut it and capture the whole market, but this will earn it no profit. It will prefer to share the market 50/50 with the other firm and earn strictly positive profits.
* &quot;Product differentiation&quot;. If products of different firms are differentiated, then consumers may not switch completely to the product with lower price.
* &quot;Dynamic competition&quot;. Repeated interaction or repeated price competition can lead to the price above MC in equilibrium.
* &quot;More money for higher price&quot;. It follows from repeated interaction: If one company sets their price slightly higher, then they will still get about the same amount of buys but more profit for each buy, so the other company will raise their price, and so on (only in repeated games, otherwise the price dynamics are in the other direction).
* &quot;Oligopoly&quot;. If the two companies can agree on a price, it is in their long-term interest to keep the agreement: the revenue from cutting prices is less than twice the revenue from keeping the agreement and lasts only until the other firm cuts its own prices.
* &quot;Effort to Purchase&quot;. If there is a difference in the effort it takes for a consumer to purchase one over the other based on the consumer&#x27;s circumstances (such as a difference in travel time to stores that stock the products), this can cause consumers to prefer one product over the other even if the product itself is exactly the same. 
* &quot;Social Interdependence&quot;. If indifferent consumers are treated as having a strategic choice between products based on loyalty and the choices of others the firms can achieve a price equilibrium with positive profits without directly violating Bertrand&#x27;s assumptions.
* &quot;Goodwill.&quot; Even when confronted with otherwise identical products in a market of price competition the two companies are themselves inherently different entities which may influence a consumer&#x27;s choice of product via brand goodwill.
* &quot;Status Quo.&quot; Consumers have an observed bias for retaining status quo so even when a new firm with identical product enters a market, consumers are biased to continue to purchase from the original firm.
* &quot;Customer Heterogeneity.&quot; While products may be homogenous, heterogenous consumers can still create a market in which two price competing firms achieve price equilibrium with positive profits.

<text>Wroughton is a large village and civil parish in northeast Wiltshire, England. It is part of the Borough of Swindon and lies along the A4361 between Swindon and Avebury; the road into Swindon crosses the M4 motorway between junctions 15 and 16. The village is about south of Swindon town centre on the edge of the Marlborough Downs, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The town of Marlborough is about to the south, and the World Heritage Site at Avebury is about to the south.

The parish includes North Wroughton, formerly a small settlement on the road towards Swindon but now part of the built-up area; and the hamlets of Elcombe and Overtown.

==History==
The earliest evidence of human presence in the area is from the Mesolithic period, although this is fairly limited. More significant evidence of settlement and occupation in the area is available for the Neolithic period, most notably due to the extensive ritual complex at Avebury and scattered finds in the locality. The earliest archaeological evidence from within Wroughton dates from the Roman period (AD 43–410), showing a period of intensive settlement and farming in the area. Occupation of the area continued into the early Middle Ages (AD 410–1066) when two battles are understood to have taken place in the area: Breahburh (AD 567), thought to have been fought by Ceawlin of Wessex on the slopes of Barbury Hill, and Ellandun (AD 825) at Elcombe Hall by Egbert of Wessex. However, there is no agreement that the latter was here (it is known to have been south of Swindon). Burial sites in the vicinity are believed to be associated with these battles.

Until the 19th century it was just a country village. Wroughton is close to The Ridgeway, a national path which is connected to the ancient Uffington White Horse. In the 20th century the village grew but largely avoided the effects of suburbanisation while its larger neighbour Swindon expanded rapidly to the immediate north. The construction of the M4 motorway prevented Swindon from enveloping Wroughton, which has retained a village identity, albeit with the population of a small market town (approximately 8,000 residents) in the early 21st century.

In 1874, the village celebrated for two days after the horse &quot;George Frederick&quot; which was stabled in the High Street, won The Derby. The horse and its trainer, Tom Leader, who was born in Wroughton, were escorted from Swindon railway station by a brass band and received in the village which had declared all of its pubs to be open houses and provided free beer for the occasion.

===Wroughton Feast===
Between 1855 and 1930, there was an &quot;annual feast&quot;—a week-long summer fair attended by local farmers and residents from north Wiltshire in the school holidays. Events included &quot;A Programme of Horse, Pony, Donkey and Foot racing; climbing the greasy pole ...&quot; the prize being a leg of mutton at the end. The event was held at the rear of the Three Tuns pub with other local fairs and a grandstand was built in the field. The main event was the &quot;Champion Gip Fight&quot;, a bare-knuckle boxing competition between a Gypsy champion and a challenger.

Frederick Large, in his book &quot;A Swindon Retrospect 1855–1930&quot; comments: 
&quot;&quot;At Wroughton Feast, an annual festival lasting a week, it was the custom for many years for &quot;the champion gip&quot; to fight the best man who could be produced, for a purse of gold. The venue was the paddock at the back of the Three Tuns tavern, where the usual paraphernalia of fairs used to congregate in full force. The Feast always took place in the summer at a time which included a week of our school holidays. I was not more than seven or eight years of age when, without my parents&#x27; consent, I wandered over to Wroughton ... This annual event always commenced on a Sunday evening by friends and neighbours from Swindon, Wroughton and neighbouring villages congregating at the Three Tuns, where, crowded inside and out, large quantities of beer and spirits were consumed. A miniature grand stand was erected for Feast Week in an orchard adjoining the paddock, upon which many of the elite of the neighbourhood, both ladies and gentlemen, occupied seats, and indulged freely in choice fruits and refreshments.&quot;&quot;
==Parish church==

The Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist and St Helen stands on a ridge above the southwest of the present village, near the road to Avebury. The present church is the result of remodelling in the 14th and 15th centuries but the Norman north and south doorways indicate an earlier building, of which the north arcade survived until T.H. Wyatt replaced it during restoration work in 1846. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1955.

The shallow bowl of the font, simply decorated, is from the 13th century. The oldest of the six bells is dated 1596, and three others are from the next century. Stained glass in the 1852 east window is by Powell and Sons.

The ecclesiastical parish extends a little further north than the civil parish, to take in the large housing areas at Wichelstowe which began to be built in 2006. At some point the name of the parish was changed to Wroughton and Wichelstowe.

==Amenities==
===Schools===
The Ridgeway School and Sixth Form College opened in 1967 as Wiltshire&#x27;s first purpose-built comprehensive school. It teaches about 1,500 children aged 11–18. The catchment area includes Bishopstone, Hinton Parva, Wanborough, Liddington, Coate, Badbury, Chiseldon, Hodson, Uffcott, Broad Hinton and Winterbourne Bassett.

===RAF Wroughton===
RAF Wroughton, just south of the village, closed in the 1990s. The site is now the Science Museum at Wroughton, a part of the Science Museum Group and used as a storage site occasionally open to the public. Since 2016, television series &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; has used part of the northern perimeter road as a car test track.

===Ellendune Centre===
The Ellendune Centre is a sports and entertainment venue that boasts one of the larger amateur facilities in the local area. It plays host to amateur dramatic groups who use it to meet and perform, including the Ellendune Entertainers and WADAMS (Wroughton Amateur Dramatic and Musical Society).

===Wroughton reservoir===
Wroughton reservoir on Overtown Hill Road is a live fishing site. The main types of fish are Tench, Bream, Crucian Carp, Rudd and Carp. The reservoir is 1.01 hectares in size and the water is fed from the large area of fields above.

==Sport==
Wroughton ASC Swimming Club trains young swimmers and competes in team galas both locally and across Wiltshire, as well as the annual Wiltshire County Championships.

A greyhound racing track was opened in the fields opposite the Black Horse Hotel and Inn in North Wroughton on 26 July 1930. The race distance was 500 yards. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and it was known as a flapping track which was the nickname given to independent tracks. It is not known when the racing ended.

For many years, the twinning committee organised a fun Bowls/Pétanque tournament. Some Saint-Germinois would come from the twin-town to play on Wroughton&#x27;s boulodrome (pétanque terrain) and some Wroughtonians would return the compliment on St Germain&#x27;s bowling green.

== Governance ==
The local authority is Swindon Borough Council, a unitary authority. Wroughton forms part of the council&#x27;s Wroughton and Wichelstowe ward.

==Notable people==

*Fiona Benson, poet, born in Wroughton in 1978
*Sir Henry Langton, later Calley (1914–1997), RAF pilot, county councillor and Chairman of Wiltshire County Council, lived at Wroughton
*Geoffrey Cox, Attorney General for England and Wales and MP for the Torridge and West Devon constituency, born in Wroughton
*Jahméne Aaron Douglas, singer, runner-up to James Arthur on the ninth series of The X Factor in 2012, brought up in Wroughton
*William Gosling (VC) (1892–1945), recipient of the Victoria Cross in 1917, farmer at Wroughton

<doc id="528311" wikidata="Q368501" url="?curid=528311" title="Sergei Fedorov">
<text>Sergei Viktorovich Fyodorov (; born December 13, 1969) is a Russian former professional ice hockey player and the former head coach of CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) from 2021 to 2024. During his playing career, for which he is best known for his 13 seasons with the Detroit Red Wings, Fedorov was primarily a centre, but occasionally played as a winger or defenceman.

Fedorov was one of the first hockey players to defect from his native Soviet Union in order to play in the National Hockey League (NHL). While playing with Detroit, he won the Stanley Cup three times, as well as the Hart Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player in 1994. After leaving the Red Wings in the summer of 2003, Fedorov played stints with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Columbus Blue Jackets and Washington Capitals before retiring from the NHL in 2009. He played in over 1,200 NHL games and scored 483 goals in the NHL. He is a three-time Olympian, the first European-trained player to win the Hart Trophy and is considered to be one of the best playoff performers in NHL history. In 2017, Fedorov was named one of the &quot;100 Greatest NHL Players&quot; in history.

Fedorov was considered one of the best players in the world from the 1990s to the early 2000s. He last played for Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the KHL, where he was made captain in early September 2011. He was also an ambassador for Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Fedorov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 9, 2015, and to the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Playing career==

===Defection and career with the Red Wings===
When he was just 16, Fedorov was already playing for CSKA Moscow in the Soviet Union with future NHL Hall-of-Famer Pavel Bure and Alexander Mogilny, among others. In 1989, Mogilny became the first Soviet superstar to defect in order to play in the NHL. Less than two months later, Fedorov was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the fourth round, 74th overall, of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. Red Wings general manager Jim Devellano had consulted team captain and future Hall-of-Famer Steve Yzerman about Fedorov, knowing that the two had played against each other in the World Championships. Yzerman told Devellano, &quot;He&#x27;s better than me.&quot;

Detroit sportswriter Keith Gave was asked by Wings executive vice-president Jim Lites to pass a secret message to Fedorov at an exhibition game in Helsinki where the Soviet national team was scheduled to play a Finnish elite-level club. Gave agreed to the mission, and in August 1989, managed to meet with Fedorov and teammate Vladimir Konstantinov, whom the Wings had also drafted, and slip them each a Red Wings media guide with a letter hidden inside. The letters made it clear that the Red Wings wanted both of them in Detroit and were willing to help them get there.

By July 1990, Fedorov had decided to defect. The Soviet national team came to North America to play in the 1990 Goodwill Games, and had scheduled an exhibition match in Portland&#x27;s Memorial Coliseum on July 22, 1990. Jim Lites came to Portland, picked up Fedorov outside his hotel after the game, and brought him to Detroit in Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch&#x27;s private jet.

Fedorov was described as &quot;three great players in one&quot;. In his career, he &quot;once held claim to the title of top player on the planet&quot;. Former Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman said Fedorov was the &quot;best skater I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. During the 1993–94 season, Fedorov&#x27;s outstanding play earned him the &quot;oldest and most prestigious individual award in hockey&quot;, the Hart Memorial Trophy (awarded to the NHL&#x27;s most valuable player), the Frank J. Selke Trophy (top defensive forward) and the Lester B. Pearson Award (awarded to the most outstanding player as selected by NHL players). He finished second in scoring behind the Los Angeles Kings&#x27; Wayne Gretzky with 56 goals and 120 points.

During the 1993–94 season, being interviewed before his game, Gretzky was talking about a December 17 game between the Red Wings and New York Rangers, saying, &quot;[H]e had never seen a player dominate the game the way Sergei did.&quot; Later in the season, Gretzky also commented that he thought Fedorov was &quot;the best player in the game at this point.&quot; Fedorov was introduced to Gretzky by Paul Coffey during the 1994 NHL All-Star Game, which led to him staying over at his Los Angeles home with his family for two weeks that year.

Playing in his second game after coming back from an injury, Steve Yzerman was asked about Fedorov&#x27;s play during the season: &quot;I&#x27;ve only seen two other players that can dominate a game like Sergei, and that&#x27;s Wayne and Mario ... In my opinion, he&#x27;s the best player in the League. He is different than Wayne and Mario because he dominates with his speed, and unbelievable one-on-one moves.&quot; Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman was also asked in an interview during the season where he thought Fedorov ranked among the players and teams he has coached in his career: &quot;He&#x27;s right at the top. He&#x27;s got the greatest leg strength I&#x27;ve seen in a player. His legs are phenomenal.&quot;

In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Fedorov finished second on the Red Wings in points with 50 (20 goals and 30 assists) in 42 games. That season, in a game against Los Angeles on February 12, Fedorov scored all four of Detroit&#x27;s goals in a 4–4 tie. Although the Red Wings lost the Stanley Cup Finals that year to the New Jersey Devils, Fedorov led the playoffs in all scoring with 24 points (seven goals and 17 assists). He also led the Stanley Cup Finals in goals and led the Red Wings in points.

Fedorov won another Selke Trophy in 1996 after scoring 39 goals and 107 points in 78 games, while playing stellar defensively. He finished in the top five for Hart Trophy voting and led Detroit in scoring, and helped them win the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. That season, Detroit set an NHL record for wins in a season with 62. He also signed a four-year deal that season to become the first non-North American spokesman for Nike, in which he made the &quot;white skates&quot; famous. The skates were different due to their unique colours and design, and he promoted it through a series of commercials for Nike. Steve Yzerman, speaking to a reporter on Fedorov a few weeks after turning the tide on a January 30 game that season that ended in a 4–2 victory for the Red Wings over the Toronto Maple Leafs, said, &quot;Sergei is a game-breaker for us anytime he&#x27;s on the ice ... He&#x27;s the most talented player I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; The Red Wings&#x27; season ended in disappointment when they were defeated by the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference Finals, four games to two. Fedorov finished tied for the team lead with 20 points in 19 playoff games.

In the 1996–97 season, Fedorov played before the preseason started in August and September for Russia at the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. Later in the NHL season, he was a member of the Red Wings&#x27; first Stanley Cup championship team since 1955, leading the team playoff scoring with 20 points in 20 games, including 8 goals. He led the Stanley Cup Finals in points and in goals for a second time. Goaltender Mike Vernon won the Conn Smythe Trophy, &quot;but many hockey insiders believe that Sergei deserved that honor&quot;. During the regular season, Fedorov had achieved the rare feat of scoring five goals in a single game, as he registered all of Detroit&#x27;s goals in a 5–4 overtime win against the Washington Capitals on December 26, 1996. It was also the first time in NHL history that a player completed a quintet of goals in overtime, a feat since equaled only by the Rangers&#x27; Mika Zibanejad on March 5, 2020, also against the Capitals.

In the mid-1990s, Fedorov became part of the Red Wings&#x27; Russian Five, together with Igor Larionov at center, Vyacheslav Kozlov at left, and Viacheslav Fetisov and Vladimir Konstantinov on defense. The Wings won the Stanley Cup in 1997 and 1998.

After a lengthy holdout to start the 1997–98 season, Fedorov, a restricted free agent, signed an offer sheet with the Carolina Hurricanes worth up to $38 million, including bonuses. The Red Wings matched the offer on February 26, 1998, ending Fedorov&#x27;s holdout. The offer included $14 million for signing and $2 million for 21 regular-season games. However, the most controversial part of the contract was a $12 million bonus payable immediately if Fedorov&#x27;s team reached the 1998 conference finals—at the time, Detroit was already a Stanley Cup contender while Carolina was almost certain to miss the playoffs, so the clause was criticized for creating an unfair disadvantage for Detroit. Nevertheless, the Red Wings matched the offer and paid the bonus. The $28 million Detroit paid Fedorov for 43 total games in 1997–98 remains the largest single-season amount paid to an NHL player. Fedorov led the playoffs in goals and helped the Red Wings win their second consecutive Stanley Cup.

On February 14, 1999, Fedorov announced his entire base salary for the 1998–99 season—$2 million—would be used to create the Sergei Fedorov Foundation, a charity to assist Detroit-area children. During the 1990s, Fedorov was third in playoff scoring with 126 points, behind only Mark Messier (126) and Mario Lemieux (136). Fedorov is only the third player in NHL history to have four consecutive 20+ point playoffs, along with Mike Bossy and Bryan Trottier. He also led the NHL in plus-minus in the 1990s with a +221.

In 2001–02 season, Fedorov played with a star-studded roster that included newcomers Dominik Hašek, Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull, culminating with Fedorov winning his third Stanley Cup, where he led the Stanley Cup Finals again in points for a second time. During an interview with Hull days after the Red Wings&#x27; 2002 Stanley Cup championship win, he commented on Fedorov as a player and person: &quot;[Fedorov&#x27;s] maturity—not only on the ice, but off the ice—has grown immensely, and, like Stevie said, there&#x27;s not too many guys in this league, if any, that have the skill that he does. And he&#x27;s learned to use it over the years. I think everyone can see that.&quot; In the 2002–03 season, Steve Yzerman was injured for most of the season, and Fedorov led the team in scoring with 36 goals and 83 points in 80 games, also winning the inaugural Kharlamov Trophy, at the time awarded yearly to the top Russian player in the NHL.

At the 2002 NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, Fedorov slapped the puck 101.5 mph in the net to win &quot;Hardest Shot&quot;. Dominik Hašek later remarked of Fedorov&#x27;s shot, &quot;I know his shot, and I&#x27;m not surprised that he won it ... He can shoot from the blue line and he can score from the blue line.&quot; After an October 25, 2002, game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Detroit, talking to reporters about Fedorov, Mario Lemieux said, &quot;He was awesome. The way he skates, he&#x27;s just dominating out there. Especially in the neutral zone, he picks up a lot of speed. You can&#x27;t defend against that.&quot;

Fedorov signed a free-agent contract with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for less than the Red Wings offered him after Detroit lost to Anaheim in the first round of the playoffs in 2003.

===Mighty Ducks of Anaheim===
In the 2003 off-season, Fedorov signed with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim after a long contract dispute with the Red Wings in which he rejected five-year, $50 million and four-year, $40 million contract offers. On December 3, 2003, Fedorov returned to Detroit for the first time since signing with the Ducks; he was booed heavily by Detroit fans every time he touched the puck in an eventual 7–2 Red Wings victory, during which he scored one of Anaheim&#x27;s goals. He remained with Anaheim from 2003 to 2005. It was with the Ducks that Fedorov registered his 1,000th point in the NHL, becoming the first Russian-born and fifth European-born player to do so.

Some hockey legends in interviews throughout the years have commented on Fedorov&#x27;s abilities, such as former Red Wings teammate Nicklas Lidström: &quot;I think he&#x27;s the best player in the League. He&#x27;s real tough to defend against. He&#x27;s got quickness to best you if you step up to him. It&#x27;s tough to stop him.&quot; Former Boston Bruins legend Ray Bourque once said, &quot;Sergei is a dominating player, a franchise player. When he makes a move on you, he has the ability to maintain his speed or even go faster. There aren&#x27;t many defensemen who can keep up with him.&quot; Steve Yzerman and Wayne Gretzky speaking to Fox Sports columnist and Detroit radio host Art Regner in past interviews said they thought &quot;Fedorov is the most talented player they&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; After leaving the Red Wings (his first season with Anaheim, in which he scored 31 times), Fedorov had multiple injuries and his tally of 18 goals in 2006–07 was the most he scored until his retirement from the NHL in 2008–09.

===Columbus Blue Jackets===

In an unanticipated move, on November 15, 2005, Fedorov (along with a fifth-round draft pick) was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for forward Tyler Wright and rookie defenceman François Beauchemin. As a Blue Jacket, Fedorov played his 1,000th NHL game on November 30, 2005, becoming the 13th European-born player to reach 1,000 NHL games and the 205th player overall to do so.

Brian Burke, who had just joined the Mighty Ducks as general manager, found that Fedorov was less interested in contributing to the team, as he had with the Red Wings, than he was enjoying the nightlife in Los Angeles where he would be riding back in limos at 3 to 4am even on game days. Burke was so concerned that Fedorov &#x27;was a bad influence in the dressing room,&#x27; and that &#x27;other players were starting to follow his lead,&#x27; that he sent rookies Ryan Getzlaf and Corey Perry to the Ducks&#x27; AHL minor league team solely to get them away from Fedorov.

In a 2006 interview, former Detroit Red Wings head coach Scotty Bowman said, &quot;[Fedorov was] one of my favorite players as a coach because he can do anything [asked of him on ice].&quot; Bowman coached nine of Fedorov&#x27;s 13 seasons with Detroit. During the late 1990s, Bowman experimented by using Fedorov on defense and pairing him with Larry Murphy. Red Wings Senior Vice-president Jim Devellano said, &quot;I&#x27;m convinced if we left him there, he&#x27;d have won a Norris Trophy.&quot; Although he was effective playing defense, Fedorov stated he would rather play as a forward, though this did not prevent then-Blue Jackets head coach Ken Hitchcock from moving Fedorov to defense on occasion.

===Washington Capitals===
Approaching the NHL trade deadline in 2008, Fedorov was traded to the Washington Capitals in exchange for prospect Theo Ruth.

The following summer, Fedorov signed a one-year, $4 million contract with Washington. In 2008–09, what would become his final season in the NHL, Fedorov passed Alexander Mogilny for most goals scored by a Russian-born hockey player, a record that stood at 473 goals.

In a 2009 interview, Scotty Bowman recalled a conversation between Wayne Gretzky and himself: &quot;I talked to Wayne Gretzky about that six or seven years ago and he said to me: &#x27;I couldn&#x27;t play forward and defence. Mario couldn&#x27;t do it. Jagr couldn&#x27;t play defence. But Sergei could. He was a hell of a player.&#x27;&quot; A few years later, in a 2015 interview, Bowman stated he thought Fedorov &quot;could have been an all-star defenceman, but he developed his offensive skills&quot;.

On April 28, 2009, in one of his final games in the NHL, after scoring the game-winning goal in the 2009 playoffs against the New York Rangers in a 2–1 Game 7 contest, then-Capitals head coach Bruce Boudreau stated in a press conference, &quot;Let&#x27;s face it, sometimes experience pays off. He knew what he had to do, when to do it, and that&#x27;s what makes him one of the greatest players, ever.&quot; Teammate Alexander Ovechkin added, &quot;He&#x27;s our leader ... He&#x27;s our best guy in the locker room. He showed it. He&#x27;s our best guy. He has more experience than anybody in this locker room. He knows how to play like that. He just shows his leadership.&quot;

In his book, Jeremy Roenick spoke about Fedorov being one of his top ten favourite players to play against: &quot;He was a horse, bigger than you&#x27;d think he was. He could skate, handle the puck like a magician, and check you until you hated him. You didn&#x27;t get a break when you played centre against Detroit in those days.&quot; He added, &quot;Today we talk about Evgeni Malkin and Alex Ovechkin, but neither of those guys could skate with [Alexander] Mogilny or Fedorov or [Pavel] Bure.&quot;

===Kontinental Hockey League===
For the 2009–10 season, Fedorov returned to Russia, signing a two-year deal with Metallurg Magnitogorsk. He said that he wanted to fulfill his father&#x27;s lifelong dream of having his two sons play on the same team. Early in the season, Fedorov scored his 1,500th point in official games.

Fedorov announced he would be returning to CSKA Moscow as a player on October 9, 2013. &quot;The legs are still good,&quot; and, &quot;I still train twice a week,&quot; Fedorov said in response to questions of him continuing his playing career. He would appear in his last two games of his career for CSKA at the 2013 Spengler Cup, registering three shots and one goal. However, he never appeared in a KHL game for the team.

==International play==
In the (U-20) 1987 World Junior Championships, Fedorov made his national team debut for the Soviet Union. The Soviet team was ejected (as well as Canada) for their part in the infamous &quot;punch-up in Piestany&quot; bench-clearing brawl during the final game. The fight is famous for officials having turned off the arena lights in a desperate attempt at ending the 20-minute melee. He played again with CSKA Moscow teammate Alexander Mogilny in the 1988 World Junior Championships; both made the tournament All-Star Team, finishing with a silver medal.

The Bure–Fedorov–Mogilny line made its international debut at the 1989 World Junior Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. The top line of CSKA Moscow teammates combined for a total 38 points and led the Soviet Union over Canada for the gold medal. The combination of the three formed was promising for head coach Viktor Tikhonov, with expectations to replace the previous top Soviet line, the K–L–M combination of Vladimir Krutov, Larionov and Makarov.

Later that year, Fedorov made his senior debut with the Soviet national team as a 19-year-old at the 1989 World Championships in Sweden. He played with the full roster Soviet Union team that won the gold medal over Canada in their final game, and played along aside club teammates Mogilny and Vladimir Konstantinov. He also led the team in goals (6) and was second in points (9). The Soviet Union would repeat gold at the 1990 World Championships in Switzerland against Czechoslovakia, with Pavel Bure playing on Fedorov&#x27;s wing.

In the 1991 Canada Cup, the team representing the Soviet Union was missing most of its top stars due to severe political turmoil at home. Many players were declining to play for the team, and some were purposely left off the roster (such as Pavel Bure and Vladimir Konstantinov) for fears of defection. It was not known until weeks before the start of the tournament that they would even send a team. This was the final major senior event in which a team representing the Soviet Union would play. Fedorov was asked to join the team (one year after defection), which he accepted to represent his country. Though the team finished in fifth place, he did help hold an undefeated Canada to a 3–3 tie in Quebec City in their last game, where Fedorov was paired against tournament scoring leader Wayne Gretzky.

In the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, Russia had played five preliminary games in order to set the groupings for the main tournament stage. Russia was the only team that went undefeated (winning against Finland (Moscow), Germany (Landshut), Sweden (Stockholm), USA (Detroit) and tied against Canada (Calgary). The United States, Sweden and Finland games saw the Bure–Fedorov–Mogilny line for the first (and only) time internationally at senior level, which was considered &quot;perhaps the best forward line on earth&quot; at the time. With Pavel Bure injured at the end of the game against the Americans, he was not able to play in the main tournament. One of Fedorov&#x27;s goals came in the round robin of the tournament in the second period against Canada in Vancouver on a breakaway pass off the boards from defencemen Darius Kasparaitis, where he sprinted to the puck and shot it over the blocker of goaltender Curtis Joseph to tie the game. Fedorov and Mogilny played on the same line but it was Fedorov that led the team in scoring, although Russia would lose in the semi-finals against the United States after defeating Finland 5–0 in the quarter-finals.

On a team that was missing many of their top stars due to players declining and injuries, Fedorov with Pavel Bure and Mikhail Shtalenkov carried the team to a silver medal with Russia in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. In the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Fedorov and the Russians eliminated the Czech Republic in the quarter-finals 1–0, and ended the tournament winning a bronze medal in their final game, against Belarus.

In response on his decision to play hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Fedorov said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think it is appropriate to delay my decision about the Olympics any further. As much as I would enjoy representing my country in Italy, I&#x27;m afraid that at this point in the season my focus has to remain with the Columbus Blue Jackets... I feel that the most important thing is for me to continue to work towards being 100 percent healthy. My main priority and responsibility is to the Columbus Blue Jackets and I don&#x27;t believe participating in the Olympics, which is a short, intense tournament, would be the best thing to do.&quot;

The Washington Capitals&#x27; trio of Alexander Ovechkin, Alexander Semin and Fedorov competed on the same line for Russia and won the gold medal at the 2008 World Championships, 5–4 in overtime against Canada; Fedorov passed to Ilya Kovalchuk to set up the game-winning goal. The tournament was held for the first time in Canada (in Quebec City) for the 100th anniversary celebrations. At the 2009 World Championships, Russia would repeat as champions after again defeating Canada in the final.

Fedorov also played for Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, the oldest player in the tournament at age 40. Although Russia entered the competition ranked number one in the world, Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. Fedorov nonetheless finished the Olympics at a point-per-game pace and tied Alexander Ovechkin for second overall in team scoring.

On December 27, 2013, Fedorov played for CSKA Moscow in the 2013 Spengler Cup—in two games, he scored one goal.

==Post-playing career==
On November 9, 2015, Fedorov was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. During the weekend festivities, many of his past coaches and teammates commented on Fedorov&#x27;s career. Scotty Bowman was speaking about having to put Sergei on defence when injuries were piling up: &quot;He was the best defenseman in the league for a six-week period.&quot; Former teammate Brendan Shanahan said, &quot;I&#x27;m convinced if Sergei played defense, he could have won a Norris Trophy ... He was so talented, so strong.&quot; Wayne Gretzky spoke on their friendship: &quot;He was one of my closer friends that played on another team. Actually, the year he won the Hart Memorial Trophy I think it was, he lived with us for six weeks in the offseason and we trained together and spent a lot of time together.&quot; Alexander Ovechkin said he was &quot;the best player I&#x27;ve ever played with. He was unbelievable. You put him in every position and he was going to be the best. His hockey sense was unbelievable. His shot and vision, unbelievable&quot;.

=== CSKA Moscow ===
Fedorov was general manager of CSKA Moscow from the 2012-13 KHL season to the 2016-17 KHL season.

On July 14, 2021, Fedorov was named head coach of CSKA. In his first two seasons, he brought CSKA to win back-to-back Gagarin Cup in 7 games. His contract was not renewed following a sub-par 2023–24 season, where CSKA was eliminated from the Gagarin Cup Playoffs in the first round by eventual finalists Lokomotiv Yaroslavl.

==Personal life==
Fedorov was born to Viktor and Natalia Fedorov in Pskov. Fedorov claimed he and tennis star Anna Kournikova were married in 2001. Kournikova&#x27;s representatives deny any marriage to Fedorov, however Fedorov&#x27;s agent, Pat Brisson, claims that although he doesn&#x27;t know when they got married, he knew &quot;he [Fedorov] was married&quot;. Although she claims to have never married the hockey superstar, she did turn over her South Beach condo as part of the divorce. Fedorov was also romantically linked to actress Tara Reid in 2004.

Fedorov is presently married to Corrina Fedorov. Together they have a daughter named Aleksandra.

Fedorov also had a cereal named after him called Fedorov Crunch.

In 2006, Fedorov appeared in Soccer Aid, a football game that takes place in England pitting celebrities against each other to benefit UNICEF UK. He competed for the &quot;rest of the world&quot; squad.

On July 24, 2009, Fedorov filed a lawsuit against Joseph Zada for defrauding on an agreement to pay him $60 million to compensate him for the $43 million Fedorov invested with Zada over the past 11 years. The lawsuit was filed by Fedorov in Michigan. Fedorov won the suit but has been unable to collect on the judgment from Zada.

Fedorov continues his philanthropic endeavours via the Sergei Fedorov Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable foundation, which has donated over $800,000 to charities that mostly benefit children in need.

Fedorov currently serves as the head coach of CSKA Moscow. He resides in Moscow during hockey season and splits his summers between Detroit and Miami.

Sergei is the brother of former professional hockey player Fedor Fedorov.

<text>Michael E. Brown (born June 5, 1965) is an American astronomer, who has been professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) since 2003. His team has discovered many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), including the dwarf planet Eris, which was originally thought to be bigger than Pluto, triggering a debate on the definition of a planet.

He has been referred to by himself and by others as the man who &quot;killed Pluto&quot;, because he furthered Pluto&#x27;s being downgraded to a dwarf planet in the aftermath of his discovery of Eris and several other probable trans-Neptunian dwarf planets. He is the author of &quot;How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming&quot;, published in 2010. He was awarded the Kavli Prize (shared with Jane Luu and David C. Jewitt) in 2012 &quot;for discovering and characterizing the Kuiper Belt and its largest members, work that led to a major advance in the understanding of the history of our planetary system.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Brown was raised in Huntsville, Alabama, and graduated from Virgil I. Grissom High School in 1983. He earned his A.B. degree in physics from Princeton University in 1987, where he was a member of the Princeton Tower Club. Brown completed his senior thesis, titled &quot;Simulating the measurement of the correlation function of the Shane–Wirtanen galaxy counts&quot;, under the supervision of Edward Groth. He did his graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned an M.A. degree in astronomy in 1990 and a Ph.D. degree in astronomy in 1994.

==Career==

===Discoveries===
Brown is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery or co-discovery of 29 minor planets, not counting Haumea &quot;(see list below)&quot;. He is best known in the scientific community for his surveys for distant objects orbiting the Sun. His team has discovered many trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Particularly notable are Eris, a dwarf planet and the only TNO known to be more massive than Pluto, leading directly to Pluto&#x27;s demotion from planet status; Sedna, a planetoid thought to be the first observed body of the inner Öpik–Oort cloud; and Orcus. Brown&#x27;s team famously named Eris and its moon Dysnomia with the informal names Xena and Gabrielle, respectively, after the two main characters of &quot;&quot;. Together with Jean-Luc Margot in 2001, he also discovered Romulus and Linus, two minor-planet moons in the asteroid belt.

=== List of minor-planet discoveries ===
===Haumea controversy===
Brown and his team also had been observing the dwarf planet for approximately six months before its announced discovery by José Luis Ortiz Moreno and colleagues from the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain. Brown originally indicated his support for Ortiz&#x27;s team&#x27;s being given credit for the discovery of Haumea. However, further investigation showed that a website containing archives of where the telescopes of Brown&#x27;s team had been pointed while tracking Haumea had been accessed eight times in the three days preceding Ortiz&#x27;s announcement, by computers with IP addresses that were traced back to the website of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (CSIC, Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia), where Ortiz works, and to e-mail messages sent by Ortiz and his student. These website accesses came a week after Brown had published an abstract for an upcoming conference talk at which he had planned to announce the discovery of Haumea; the abstract referred to Haumea by a code that was the same code used in the online telescope logs; and the Andalusia computers had accessed the logs containing that code directly, as would be the case after an internet search, without going through the home page or other pages of the archives. When asked about this online activity, Ortiz responded with an email to Brown that suggested Brown was at fault for &quot;hiding objects&quot;, and said that &quot;the only reason why we are now exchanging e-mail is because you did not report your object.&quot; Brown says that this statement by Ortiz contradicts the accepted scientific practice of analyzing one&#x27;s research until one is satisfied that it is accurate, then submitting it to peer review prior to any public announcement. However, the Minor Planet Center only needs precise enough orbit determination on the object in order to provide discovery credit, which Ortiz provided (see Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons to verify typical time scale of observation and publication of discoveries).

The then director of the IAA, José Carlos del Toro, distanced himself from Ortiz, insisting that its researchers have &quot;sole responsibility&quot; for themselves. Brown petitioned the International Astronomical Union to credit his team rather than Ortiz as the discoverers of Haumea. The IAU has deliberately not acknowledged a discoverer of Haumea. The discovery date and location are listed as March 7, 2003, at Ortiz&#x27;s Sierra Nevada Observatory. However, the IAU accepted Brown&#x27;s suggested name of Haumea, which fit the names of Haumea&#x27;s two moons, rather than Ortiz&#x27;s &quot;Ataecina.&quot;

===Proposed ninth planet===
In January 2016, Brown and fellow Caltech astronomer, Konstantin Batygin, proposed the existence of Planet Nine, a major planet between the size of Earth and Neptune. The two astronomers gave a recorded interview in which they described their method and reasoning for proposing Planet 9 on January 20, 2016.

===Other work===
In 2010 Brown published a memoir of his discoveries and surrounding family life, &quot;How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming&quot;.

==Honors, awards and accolades==
Brown was named one of &quot;Time&quot; 100 most influential people of 2006. In 2007 he received Caltech&#x27;s annual Feynman Prize, Caltech&#x27;s most prestigious teaching honor. Asteroid 11714 Mikebrown, discovered on April 28, 1998, was named in his honor. In 2012, Brown was awarded the Kavli Prize in Astrophysics.

==Students and postdocs==
Brown&#x27;s former graduate students and postdocs include astrophysicists Adam Burgasser, Jean-Luc Margot, Chad Trujillo, Marc Kuchner, Antonin Bouchez, Emily Schaller, Darin Ragozzine, and Megan Schwamb. He also has created a course on Coursera.

==Personal life==
Brown married Diane Binney on March 1, 2003. They have one daughter.

<text>TDT is a digital television station in Tasmania, Australia. It is jointly owned by WIN Corporation and Southern Cross Austereo, operating as &quot;Tasmanian Digital Television&quot;.

==History==
In Australia, the major capital cities, and a majority of the regional areas, are served by three commercial broadcasters. However, some less populated areas are only granted two licences (and until the early 2000s, one in some cases) because there is not enough advertising revenue in some areas to sustain three separate commercial broadcasters.

In 2002, WIN Television, who had a Nine Network affiliation in Tasmania, and Southern Cross Broadcasting (now Southern Cross Austereo), who had a Seven Network affiliation in Tasmania in combination with a Network Ten affiliation in other regions, lodged a joint application under the &quot;Broadcasting Services Act (1992)&quot; to establish a third commercial broadcaster in Tasmania. The application was successful with TDT launching on 22 December 2003 on LCN 5. The station was available in Hobart from its launch date and to north-eastern Tasmania (including Launceston) in August 2004, and in 2006 Kelcey Tier, Devonport. Rollout continued across the state over the following years including the rest of the north-west coast, the west coast and the east coast before the digital switchover in 2013.

TDT was the first digital-only commercial channel in Australia. TDT&#x27;s effect on the digital television market in Tasmania was widely anticipated, as success or failure would strongly guide the digital plans of other broadcasters.

As part of the joint venture, Southern Cross Broadcasting is responsible for handling playout (from their Canberra facility), and transmits this signal via satellite to WIN Television transmission facilities in Tasmania. WIN Television handle the business administration and advertising sales for TDT.

In May 2016, WIN Television announced it was taking up a Network Ten affiliation across its stations from 1 July 2016, affecting its Tasmanian station TVT. With TDT&#x27;s number two rating Ten content being taken by WIN, the Nine Network would have to sign a new deal with TDT to ensure its content continued to be seen by Tasmanians. Following intense negotiations which lasted until the last day, 30 June, a deal was made for TDT to become a Nine Network affiliate. As a result, from 2016 to 2021, TDT Nine rebroadcast the Nine Melbourne feed supplemented with local advertising. As a result of the 2021 affiliation swapback, from 2021 to present, TDT 10 rebroadcasts the 10 Melbourne feed supplemented with local advertising.

==Programming==
Following significant public speculation about how programming would be carried by the new station, one of two options were suggested: Southern Cross would drop one of its affiliations (either Seven or Ten) and TDT would pick it up; or TDT would also become a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, and carry the programs that Southern Cross opted not to broadcast.

Southern Cross did not want to disrupt its existing market-leading program line-up, so the agreement TDT signed with Ten allowed Southern Cross to have &#x27;first pick&#x27; of Ten programming. If both networks wanted to broadcast a program, Southern Cross had to broadcast it at the same time as TDT. If Southern Cross wanted to broadcast a Ten program at a different time, TDT would usually broadcast an alternative program. Examples of this included Thank God You&#x27;re Here, The Bold and the Beautiful, and The Wedge. Huey&#x27;s Cooking Adventures was an exception, with both networks screening it at different times.

From its initial broadcast in late December 2003, to late January 2004, TDT showed a direct feed of ATV-10 in Melbourne. As access to the TDT Ten broadcast gradually spread across the state in the following years, Southern Cross agreed to progressively drop Ten programs from its line-up. Southern Cross dropped Rove Live and Totally Wild in 2004, Big Brother in 2006, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in 2007, &quot;Huey&#x27;s Cooking Adventures&quot;, Australian Idol and &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; in 2008 (though it returned in 2009 with the program&#x27;s move to Seven), and Neighbours and The Simpsons in 2009. In 2009, the only Ten content broadcast by Southern Cross was AFL.

During the AFL season, TDT simulcast the Ten News Melbourne bulletin (presented by George Donikian and broadcast to Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth) on Saturday nights at 6:00pm which complemented Ten&#x27;s Saturday AFL coverage. On Sundays, Ten&#x27;s national bulletin presented by Natarsha Belling from Sydney was broadcast.

On 1 July 2016, TDT started to rebroadcast the Nine Melbourne feed supplemented with local advertising. On 1 July 2021, the affiliation switch was reversed and TDT switched back to the 10 Melbourne feed.

===News===
In 2012, the station began airing short local news updates produced by Southern Cross Austereo from their studios in Canberra. Production was moved to Southern Cross&#x27; Hobart newsroom in October 2018 where they adopted a similar look to the network-produced local bulletins broadcast on Southern Cross&#x27; mainland Nine affiliate stations. The Tasmania updates are currently presented by Madeline Kerr.

As a Network 10 affiliate, TDT simulcasts the hour and a half-long 10 News First Melbourne from ATV-10 presented weekdays by Jennifer Keyte as well as their weekend bulletins from TEN-10.

TDT used to simulcast the hour-long Nine News Melbourne from GTV-9 when it was a Nine affiliate presented weekdays by Peter Hitchener as well as their weekend bulletins.

==Availability==
TDT is simulcast in digital standard definition and 1080p high definition (10 HD). TDT is broadcast in most areas across Tasmania. TDT is an affiliate of Network 10, also broadcasts most of 10&#x27;s sub-channels (10 Bold Drama, 10 Peach Comedy and Nickelodeon) and carries their branding and most programs.

<doc id="528322" wikidata="Q688874" url="?curid=528322" title="Samael (band)">
<text>Samael () is a Swiss metal band formed in Sion in 1987. Their current lineup includes founding members and brothers Vorphalack (Vorph) and Xytraguptor (Xy), guitarist Drop and bassist Ales. A few other members have been part of the band throughout the years: Rodolph H. (keyboards, 1993–1995), Kaos (guitar, 1996–2001), Mas (bass, 1991–2014) and Makro (guitar, 2002–2018).

Samael is known to incorporate metal, industrial, electronic and symphonic music into their sound and mix it with massive beats, martial rhythms and up-tempo or blast beat. One of the key elements that distinguishes Samael from traditional metal bands is the use of a drum machine in studio and live on stage.

== History ==

=== Early years and first two albums, 1987–1993 ===
Although Vorphalack jammed and played with his friend Pat on drums since April 1987, it was when his brother Xytraguptor first sat behind the drums kit on 14 July 1988 that Samael really started. The two brothers soon recorded and released a 7-inch EP with two original songs &quot;Into the Pentagram&quot; and &quot;The Dark&quot; and a cover from Hellhammer &quot;The Third of the Storm&quot;. They played a few shows in Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland before entering Taurus Studio in Geneva to record their first album. Samael became a trio when Masmiseîm joined the band as a bass player, the new formation played its first show in Poland. &quot;Worship Him&quot; (1991) become the first album released by Osmose Productions one year after being recorded. The band played a bunch of shows to promote the album including a short eastern tour with Napalm Death which ended with two shows in Moscow.
Samael signed with Century Media and record their second album at T&amp;T Studio in Gelsenkirchen with producer Waldemar Sorychta. &quot;Blood Ritual&quot; is released on 1 December 1992, a month later the band embarked on their first European Tour with label mates Unleashed and Tiamat. The 20-date tour ended in Belgium with an indoor festival with Fear Factory, Brutal Truth and Agnostic Front among other bands.

=== &quot;Ceremony of Opposites&quot; and &quot;Rebellion&quot;, 1994–1995 ===
Recorded and mixed in 10 days in Woodhouse Studios in Hagen (Germany) &quot;Ceremony of Opposites&quot; was produced by Waldemar Sorychta and released on 18 February 1994. The addition of keyboards in every song is accountable for the recruiting of Rodolph H who joined the band as keyboards player. A few samples could be heard throughout the album and most notably the voice of Aleister Crowley on the song &quot;Crown&quot; and the beginning of &quot;The Hut on the Hen&#x27;s Legs (Baba Yaga)&quot; of the Pictures at an Exhibition from Modest Mussorgsky in &quot;Baphomet&#x27;s Throne&quot;. The crunchy and aggressive guitar sound, the keyboards orchestration, the metallic sound of the drums and over the top screaming vocal turned it into a seminal black metal album.

The band got invited by Martin Eric Ain (Celtic Frost) to play at the Lucifer Rising convention in Zurich in March before they joined the Full of Hate Festival tour headlined by Morbid Angel and Cannibal Corpse. A video for the song &quot;Baphomet&#x27;s Throne&quot; was shot during that tour. The tour was followed by Samael&#x27;s first headliner tour in Europe with Grave, Massacra and Therion as supports. The same year the band did their first US tour: 23 dates in 23 days up and down the East Coast as support for Cannibal Corpse and continued that tour in Europe for another 41 shows.

February 1995 the band was back in studio to record the &quot;Rebellion&quot; mini album. Two new tracks, two re-arranged songs and a cover version of &quot;I Love the Dead&quot; from Alice Cooper. &quot;Static Journey&quot; were the first songs Samael recorded with programmed drums. The Rebellion Tour started in Europe with Sentenced and ended with two shows in Mexico.

=== &quot;Passage&quot; and &quot;Exodus&quot;, 1996–1998 ===

The band decided to work with a drum machine after Rodolph left the band. Xy moved from the drums to the keyboards and programmed all the drums parts. Kaos joined the band as second guitarist and the band went back to Woodhouse Studios for a 3 weeks session. The first show with the drum machine and new line up was on 26 June in Z7 in Pratteln (Switzerland) as opener for Kreator, the following day Samael played in With Full Force festival alongside Ministry, Motörhead, and Front Line Assembly. &quot;Passage&quot; was released on 19 August 1996 and a full European tour followed with support from label mates Moonspell and Rotting Christ. A video was shot in Berlin for the song &quot;Jupiterian Vibe&quot; directed by Andreas Marshall.

Samael co-headlined the 1997 Full of Hate Festival tour with Obituary, Entombed, Crowbar and Strapping Young Lad completed the line up. Later on that year they took part in another tour festival across Germany alongside Kreator, Sodom, Exodus, Grip Inc. and In Flames. That summer the band played for the first and only time at Dynamo Open Air in Eindhoven as well as Wacken, Grasspop, and With Full Force festival. In the meantime Xy released on his own label a neo classical version of &quot;Passage&quot; under the name &quot;Xytras&quot;. &quot;Exodus&quot; mini album was released in April 1998, in June Samael played in Istanbul with Kreator.

=== &quot;Eternal&quot;, &quot;Black Trip&quot; DVD, 1999–2003 ===
In Montreux (Switzerland) at the Mountain Studios, Samael recorded their new album with rock producer David Richards. The sound and the overall production of &quot;Eternal&quot; was very much rooted in the 1970s while the approach of the songs was very contemporary. The gap between the opening song &quot;Year Zero&quot; and &quot;Infra Galaxia&quot; or between the Deep Purple sounding &quot;Radiant Star&quot; and the electronic stamped &quot;Ways&quot; is very wide. The band toured in Europe with Grip Inc. and Lacuna Coil before going to the US with Dimmu Borgir, Monstrosity and Epoch of Unlight. The following summer they played with Iron Maiden at Artefact Fest in France.

Early 2002 Kaos departed from the band and was replaced by Makro. With the new line-up, the band played a couple of shows before the Summer Breeze Open Air which became the core of Samael&#x27;s first DVD &quot;Black Trip&quot;. In the meantime, Vorph and Xy worked on an electronic project which was released in 2006 under the name Era One. In January 2003 Samael was back on the road with Cathedral and Without Face for the Redemption Tour, the tour then went to the US with Strapping Young Lad and Cathedral as supporting acts.

=== &quot;Reign of Light&quot; and &quot;Solar Soul&quot;, 2004–2008 ===
&quot;Reign of Light&quot; was recorded and mixed during the summer 2004, first single &quot;Telephath&quot; came with a video and was released in September, the album was out in October. The band toured Europe with support acts Flowing Tears for the first part of the tour and Dagoba for the Scandinavian dates. Samael later supported Oomph! in Germany. The next year, the single &quot;On Earth&quot; which featured a cover of &quot;I Feel you&quot; from Depeche Mode was released. The band played summer festivals in Europe and Switzerland. In Paleo Festival in Nyon (Switzerland) they played before Rammstein, four songs of that performance ended up on a bonus DVD for a special edition of &quot;Reign of Light&quot;. In Paris, the band received an award from &quot;Hard Rock&quot; magazine for best industrial album. After a European tour with Obituary the band finished recording their following album.

In March 2007 Samael opened for Iggy Pop in Montana (Switzerland) where they played two new songs for the first time: &quot;On the Rise&quot;, and &quot;Slavocracy&quot;. &quot;Solar Soul&quot; was mixed in Sweden by Stefan Glaumann and was released on 1 June through Nuclear Blast worldwide. In July they played with Nine Inch Nails at Rock Oz&#x27;Arenes. In March 2008 they were back on the road with Gothminister and Sybreed. During the summer Vorph and Xy went to Sweden to mix with Frederic Nordström a side project that was recorded a long time ago. In September they returned to the US with Amorphis and Virgin Black. After that tour, as the final mastering for the side project was done it was decided that it would become the next Samael album.

=== &quot;Above&quot; and &quot;Lux Mundi&quot;, 2009–2014 ===

Recorded in 1999, mixed in 2008, &quot;Above&quot; was released on 6 March 2009. It was described by the band as a tribute to their metal roots and they listed some of their influences on the CD booklet: Kiss, AC/DC, Venom, Slayer, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Impaled Nazarene, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Bathory. Faster and more extreme than anything Samael released previously, the album surprised the critics and fans alike but it sent the band on a 90 more dates tour. First in Europe with Deicide, Vader, Devian and The Amenta, then in the US with Carcass, Suicide Silence and Psycroptic, and finally all across Europe with Paradise Lost and Ghost Brigade.

&quot;Lux Mundi&quot; was co produced by Xy and Waldemar Sorychta, it was recorded in Switzerland and mixed in England by Russ Russel. First the band released a mini album &quot;Antigod&quot; which featured two live tracks, a remix and new version of the song &quot;Into the Pentagram&quot; from their first album &quot;Worship Him&quot; (1991). Samael toured in Europe with Finntroll and Rotting Christ in support of that mini album. A video was shot in Sweden by Patrick Ulaeus for the song &quot;Luxferre&quot; (Latin for &quot;light carrier&quot;). On 29 April 2011 Lux Mundi was released. The band later toured in Europe with Keep of Kalessin and Melechesh.

Xy was asked by the city of Sion (Switzerland) to compose a piece of music for a sound and light show to be played in two consecutive summers. Recorded in Prague with 100 classical musicians that piece of music was released on CD under the name &quot;Sedunum&quot;. In 2013, Samael played the album &quot;Passage&quot; in its entirety at Inferno Festival Switzerland and at Metal Hammer Paradise in Germany. Bass player and long time Samael member Mas left the band in November 2014, he was replaced by Drop (ex-Sybreed).

=== Return to the past, 2015–2017 ===

20 years after it was first released, Samael celebrated their album &quot;Ceremony of Opposites&quot; (1994) by playing the entire album live over 40 times in festivals in Europe and US and with short tours in Canada, Russia and Poland. The fact that the album was performed with a drum machine instead of real drums like it was on the original recording created a polemic within the older fans of the band.

In May 2017 the members of Samael launched a side project W.A.R. (Worship and Ritual), in order to perform their first two, more primitive black metal albums, live. In this group, the original members adopted their old stage names (Vorphalack and Xytraguptor) and Xy returned to playing drums. The first W.A.R. concerts happened in Les Caves du Manoir in Martigny (Switzerland) were the band performed for two consecutive nights.

=== &quot;Hegemony&quot;, 2017–present ===
The new album &quot;Hegemony&quot; was released on 13 October 2017. Before hand the band released lyrics video for the songs &quot;Angel of Wrath&quot; and &quot;Red Planet&quot;, and a video for &quot;Black Supremacy&quot;. In early 2018, a video with live footage was released for Rite of Renewal.

<text>Taittinger () is a French wine family who are famous producers of Champagne. The estate is currently headed by Vitalie Taittinger, who is the daughter of (born 1953), a member of the consultative committee of the Banque de France. Its diversified holdings included Champagne Taittinger, Société du Louvre and Concorde Hotels, whose flagship is the famed Hotel de Crillon on the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France as well as the Loire Valley wine-producing firm of Bouvet-Ladubay, and a partnership in Domaine Carneros in California. All these holdings were sold to Starwood Capital in 2005. The family re-acquired the house of Champagne Taittinger in 2006 after securing financial support from the Crédit Agricole bank and also the backing of trade organisations.

==Champagne production==
Founded in 1734, the Taittinger Champagne house is based in Reims. The flagship wines of the house are the &quot;Comtes de Champagne&quot; (composed of 100% Chardonnay) and &quot;Comtes de Champagne Rosé&quot; (70% Pinot noir and 30% Chardonnay). In 2017, Taittinger planted its first vines in England, near a village in Kent, for its venture into English sparkling wine. The first bottle will be ready in 2023.

==History==
In 1734, Jacques Fourneaux established a wine-business in Champagne and worked closely with the Benedictine abbeys which, at that time, owned the finest vineyards in the region. After the First World War, the wine house was moved to a large mansion on the Rue de Tambour in which Theobald I of Navarre (1201–1253) had lived. A long-standing legend held that it was he who brought the Chardonnay grape from Cyprus on returning from a crusade in the Middle Ages. This claim has been disproved by using genetic analysis, ascertained at the University of California at Davis.

The Taittingers were a family of wine merchants who, in 1870, moved to the Paris region from the Lorraine in order to retain their French citizenship after the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871).

In 1932, Pierre Taittinger bought the from the wine house of Forest-Fourneaux. It had been used as a command post during World War I and he had been laid up there after suffering a heart attack during combat. The vineyards of the château had been planted with Chardonnay and Pinot noir since the 18th century. This property had been developed by Brother , a Benedictine monk, one of the founding fathers of champagne wine, and later it had belonged to the writer Jacques Cazotte.

From 1945 to 1960 the business was run by Pierre&#x27;s third son François. Under his direction, the Taittinger cellars were established in the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise, built in the thirteenth century in Gallo-Roman chalk pits dating from the fourth century. After François&#x27; death in an accident, his brother Claude took over and directed the business from 1960 to 2005. It was during this time that Taittinger became a champagne house of world renown.

Champagne Taittinger was sold in July 2005 by the Taittinger family, along with its subsidiary, Société du Louvre, to the US private investment firm Starwood Capital Group. Those in the profession (Champagne houses, wine-producers, cooperatives, distributors and customers) proposed that the objectives of short-term profitability, or even medium term, at any price, advocated by the then current managers of the business, were not compatible with the production of Champagne wine of quality, which takes time, trust and a large delegation of authority to the masters of the cellar. In addition, the arrival of investors completely foreign to the culture of Champagne could result in a major breakdown of the equilibrium of the industry.

Finally, on 31 May 2006, the Northeast Regional Bank of the Crédit Agricole, in collaboration with Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, bought the business for 660 million euros. The area covers 288.84 hectares of vineyards and has 12 to 13 million bottles in stock. The Château de la Marquetterie and its cellars were part of the overall purchase. The Starwood group retained some of the hotels, including luxury hotels Crillon, Lutetia and Martinez, and the hotel chains Campanile and Kyriad.

Claude Taittinger retired in 2006 and his nephew Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger replaced him as head of the business.

In 2017, it was announced that Taittinger had become the first champagne house to plant vines in the UK. Champagne Taittinger entered into a joint venture with UK wine agents Hatch Mansfield and in 2015 bought up land in Chilham, Kent, to plant 40 hectares of vines over the next three years.

In October 2019 it was announced that Vitalie Taittinger would become president from December 31, 2019. She had been working for the company for 12 years and was director of marketing and communications.

<text>Akshobhya (, &quot;Akṣobhya&quot;, &quot;Immovable One&quot;; ) is one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas, a product of the Adibuddha, who represents consciousness as an aspect of reality. By convention he is located in the east of the Diamond Realm and is the lord of the Eastern Pure Land Abhirati (&#x27;The Joyous&#x27;). His consort is Lochanā and he is normally accompanied by two elephants. His color is blue-black and his attributes include a bell, three robes, and staff, as well as a jewel, lotus, prayer wheel, and sword. He has several emanations.
==Textual history and doctrine==
Akshobhya appears in the Akṣobhyatathāgatasyavyūha Sūtra (), which was translated during the second century CE and is among the oldest known Mahayana or Pure Land texts. According to the scripture, a monk wished to practice the Dharma in the eastern world of delight and made a vow not to harbor anger or malice towards any being until he achieved enlightenment. He duly proved &quot;immovable&quot; and when he succeeded, he became the buddha Akshobhya. Recently, newly discovered Gāndhārī texts from Pakistan in the Bajaur Collection have been found to contain fragments of an early Mahāyāna sutra mentioning Akshobhya. Preliminary dating through paleography suggests a late 1st century to early 2nd century CE provenance. More conclusive radiocarbon dating is under way. A preliminary report on these texts has been issued by Ingo Strauch, with a paper on Akshobhya texts published in 2010. 

In the Śūraṅgama mantra (Chinese: 楞嚴咒; pinyin: &quot;Léngyán Zhòu&quot;) taught in the Śūraṅgama sutra (Chinese: 楞嚴經; pinyin: &quot;Léngyán Jīng&quot;), an especially influential dharani in the Chinese Chan tradition, Akshobhya is mentioned to be the host of the Vajra Division in the East, one of the five major divisions which controls the vast demon armies of the five directions.

Akshobhya is sometimes merged with Acala, whose name also means &quot;immovable&quot; in Sanskrit. Prior to the advent of Bhaiṣajyaguru, Akshobhya was the subject of a minor cult in Japan as a healing Buddha, though both are currently venerated within Shingon Buddhism.

==Iconography==
Akshobhya is the embodiment of &#x27;mirror knowledge&#x27; (; refer Panchajnana). This may be described as a knowledge of what is real, and what is illusion, or a mere reflection of actual reality. The mirror may be likened to the mind itself. It is clear like the sky and empty, yet luminous. It holds all the images of space and time, yet it is untouched by them. Its brilliance illuminates the darkness of ignorance and its sharpness cuts through confusion. Akshobhya represents this eternal mind, and the Vajra family is similarly associated with it.

The Vajra family, is also associated with the element of water, hence the two colours of the Vajra being blue, like the depths of the ocean; or bright white, like sunlight reflecting off water. Even if the surface of the ocean is blown into crashing waves, the depths remain undisturbed, imperturbable. Although water may seem ethereal and weightless, in truth it is extremely heavy. Water flows into the lowest place and settles there. It carves through solid rock, but calmly, without violence. When frozen, it is hard, sharp, and clear like the intellect, but to reach its full potential, it must also be fluid and adaptable like a flowing river. These are all the essential qualities of Akshobhya.

Many wrathful, tantric beings are represented as blue in colour because they embody the transmuted energy of hatred and aggression into wisdom and enlightenment.

<text>A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is a memory cache that stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory. It is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location. It can be called an address-translation cache. It is a part of the chip&#x27;s memory-management unit (MMU). A TLB may reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between CPU cache and the main memory or between the different levels of the multi-level cache. The majority of desktop, laptop, and server processors include one or more TLBs in the memory-management hardware, and it is nearly always present in any processor that uses paged or segmented virtual memory.

The TLB is sometimes implemented as content-addressable memory (CAM). The CAM search key is the virtual address, and the search result is a physical address. If the requested address is present in the TLB, the CAM search yields a match quickly and the retrieved physical address can be used to access memory. This is called a TLB hit. If the requested address is not in the TLB, it is a miss, and the translation proceeds by looking up the page table in a process called a &quot;page walk&quot;. The page walk is time-consuming when compared to the processor speed, as it involves reading the contents of multiple memory locations and using them to compute the physical address. After the physical address is determined by the page walk, the virtual address to physical address mapping is entered into the TLB. The PowerPC 604, for example, has a two-way set-associative TLB for data loads and stores. Some processors have different instruction and data address TLBs.

==Overview==
A TLB has a fixed number of slots containing page-table entries and segment-table entries; page-table entries map virtual addresses to physical addresses and intermediate-table addresses, while segment-table entries map virtual addresses to segment addresses, intermediate-table addresses and page-table addresses. The virtual memory is the memory space as seen from a process; this space is often split into pages of a fixed size (in paged memory), or less commonly into segments of variable sizes (in segmented memory). The page table, generally stored in main memory, keeps track of where the virtual pages are stored in the physical memory. This method uses two memory accesses (one for the page-table entry, one for the byte) to access a byte. First, the page table is looked up for the frame number. Second, the frame number with the page offset gives the actual address. Thus, any straightforward virtual memory scheme would have the effect of doubling the memory access time. Hence, the TLB is used to reduce the time taken to access the memory locations in the page-table method. The TLB is a cache of the page table, representing only a subset of the page-table contents.

Referencing the physical memory addresses, a TLB may reside between the CPU and the CPU cache, between the CPU cache and primary storage memory, or between levels of a multi-level cache. The placement determines whether the cache uses physical or virtual addressing. If the cache is virtually addressed, requests are sent directly from the CPU to the cache, and the TLB is accessed only on a cache miss. If the cache is physically addressed, the CPU does a TLB lookup on every memory operation, and the resulting physical address is sent to the cache.

In a Harvard architecture or modified Harvard architecture, a separate virtual address space or memory-access hardware may exist for instructions and data. This can lead to distinct TLBs for each access type, an &quot;instruction translation lookaside buffer&quot; (ITLB) and a &quot;data translation lookaside buffer&quot; (DTLB). Various benefits have been demonstrated with separate data and instruction TLBs.

The TLB can be used as a fast lookup hardware cache. The figure shows the working of a TLB. Each entry in the TLB consists of two parts: a tag and a value. If the tag of the incoming virtual address matches the tag in the TLB, the corresponding value is returned. Since the TLB lookup is usually a part of the instruction pipeline, searches are fast and cause essentially no performance penalty. However, to be able to search within the instruction pipeline, the TLB has to be small.

A common optimization for physically addressed caches is to perform the TLB lookup in parallel with the cache access. Upon each virtual memory reference, the hardware checks the TLB to see whether the page number is held therein. If yes, it is a TLB hit, and the translation is made. The frame number is returned and is used to access the memory. If the page number is not in the TLB, the page table must be checked. Depending on the CPU, this can be done automatically using a hardware or using an interrupt to the operating system. When the frame number is obtained, it can be used to access the memory. In addition, we add the page number and frame number to the TLB, so that they will be found quickly on the next reference. If the TLB is already full, a suitable block must be selected for replacement. There are different replacement methods like &quot;least recently used&quot; (LRU), &quot;first in, first out&quot; (FIFO) etc.; see the address translation section in the cache article for more details about virtual addressing as it pertains to caches and TLBs.

==Performance implications==

The CPU has to access main memory for an instruction-cache miss, data-cache miss, or TLB miss. The third case (the simplest one) is where the desired information itself actually &quot;is&quot; in a cache, but the information for virtual-to-physical translation is not in a TLB. These are all slow, due to the need to access a slower level of the memory hierarchy, so a well-functioning TLB is important. Indeed, a TLB miss can be more expensive than an instruction or data cache miss, due to the need for not just a load from main memory, but a page walk, requiring several memory accesses.

The flowchart provided explains the working of a TLB. If it is a TLB miss, then the CPU checks the page table for the page table entry. If the &quot;present bit&quot; is set, then the page is in main memory, and the processor can retrieve the frame number from the page-table entry to form the physical address. The processor also updates the TLB to include the new page-table entry. Finally, if the present bit is not set, then the desired page is not in the main memory, and a page fault is issued. Then a page-fault interrupt is called, which executes the page-fault handling routine.

If the page working set does not fit into the TLB, then TLB thrashing occurs, where frequent TLB misses occur, with each newly cached page displacing one that will soon be used again, degrading performance in exactly the same way as thrashing of the instruction or data cache does. TLB thrashing can occur even if instruction-cache or data-cache thrashing are not occurring, because these are cached in different-size units. Instructions and data are cached in small blocks (cache lines), not entire pages, but address lookup is done at the page level. Thus, even if the code and data working sets fit into cache, if the working sets are fragmented across many pages, the virtual-address working set may not fit into TLB, causing TLB thrashing. Appropriate sizing of the TLB thus requires considering not only the size of the corresponding instruction and data caches, but also how these are fragmented across multiple pages.

==Multiple TLBs==
Similar to caches, TLBs may have multiple levels. CPUs can be (and nowadays usually are) built with multiple TLBs, for example a small L1 TLB (potentially fully associative) that is extremely fast, and a larger L2 TLB that is somewhat slower. When instruction-TLB (ITLB) and data-TLB (DTLB) are used, a CPU can have three (ITLB1, DTLB1, TLB2) or four TLBs.

For instance, Intel&#x27;s Nehalem microarchitecture has a four-way set associative L1 DTLB with 64 entries for 4 KiB pages and 32 entries for 2/4 MiB pages, an L1 ITLB with 128 entries for 4 KiB pages using four-way associativity and 14 fully associative entries for 2/4 MiB pages (both parts of the ITLB divided statically between two threads) and a unified 512-entry L2 TLB for 4 KiB pages, both 4-way associative.

Some TLBs may have separate sections for small pages and huge pages. For example, Intel Skylake microarchitecture separates the TLB entries for 1 GiB pages from those for 4 KiB/2 MiB pages.

==TLB-miss handling==
Three schemes for handling TLB misses are found in modern architectures:
* With hardware TLB management, the CPU automatically walks the page tables (using the CR3 register on x86, for instance) to see whether there is a valid page-table entry for the specified virtual address. If an entry exists, it is brought into the TLB, and the TLB access is retried: this time the access will hit, and the program can proceed normally. If the CPU finds no valid entry for the virtual address in the page tables, it raises a page fault exception, which the operating system must handle. Handling page faults usually involves bringing the requested data into physical memory, setting up a page table entry to map the faulting virtual address to the correct physical address, and resuming the program. With a hardware-managed TLB, the format of the TLB entries is not visible to software and can change from CPU to CPU without causing loss of compatibility for the operating system.
* With software-managed TLBs, a TLB miss generates a &quot;TLB miss&quot; exception, and operating system code is responsible for walking the page tables and finding the appropriate page table entry. The operating system then loads the information from that page table entry into the TLB and restarts the program from the instruction that caused the TLB miss. As with hardware TLB management, if the OS finds no valid translation in the page tables, a page fault has occurred, and the OS must handle it accordingly. Instruction sets of CPUs that have software-managed TLBs have instructions that allow loading entries into any slot in the TLB. The format of the TLB entry is defined as a part of the instruction set architecture (ISA).
* With firmware-managed TLBs, a TLB miss causes a trap to system firmware, which is responsible for walking the page tables and finding the appropriate page table entry, similarly to what a TLB miss handler does for a software-managed TLB. With a firmware-managed TLB, the format of the TLB entries is not visible to system software and can change from CPU to CPU without causing loss of compatibility for the operating system.

The MIPS architecture specifies a software-managed TLB.

The SPARC V9 architecture allows an implementation of SPARC V9 to have no MMU, an MMU with a software-managed TLB, or an MMU with a hardware-managed TLB, and the UltraSPARC Architecture 2005 specifies a software-managed TLB.

The Itanium architecture provides an option of using either software- or hardware-managed TLBs.

The Alpha architecture has a firmware-managed TLB, with the TLB miss handling code being in PALcode, rather than in the operating system. As the PALcode for a processor can be processor-specific and operating-system-specific, this allows different versions of PALcode to implement different page-table formats for different operating systems, without requiring that the TLB format, and the instructions to control the TLB, to be specified by the architecture.

==Typical TLB==
These are typical performance levels of a TLB:
* Size: 12 bits – 4,096 entries 
* Hit time: 0.5 – 1 clock cycle
* Miss penalty: 10 – 100 clock cycles
* Miss rate: 0.01 – 1% (20–40% for sparse/graph applications)

The average effective memory cycle rate is defined as formula_1 cycles, where formula_2 is the number of cycles required for a memory read, formula_3 is the miss rate, and formula_4 is the hit time in cycles.
If a TLB hit takes 1 clock cycle, a miss takes 30 clock cycles, a memory read takes 30 clock cycles, and the miss rate is 1%, the effective memory cycle rate is an average of formula_5 (31.29 clock cycles per memory access).

==Address-space switch==
On an address-space switch, as occurs when context switching between processes (but not between threads), some TLB entries can become invalid, since the virtual-to-physical mapping is different. The simplest strategy to deal with this is to completely flush the TLB. This means that after a switch, the TLB is empty, and &quot;any&quot; memory reference will be a miss, so it will be some time before things are running back at full speed. Newer CPUs use more effective strategies marking which process an entry is for. This means that if a second process runs for only a short time and jumps back to a first process, the TLB may still have valid entries, saving the time to reload them.

Other strategies avoid flushing the TLB on a context switch:
(a) A single address space operating system uses the same virtual-to-physical mapping for all processes.
(b) Some CPUs have a process ID register, and the hardware uses TLB entries only if they match the current process ID.

For example, in the Alpha 21264, each TLB entry is tagged with an &quot;address space number&quot; (ASN), and only TLB entries with an ASN matching the current task are considered valid. For another example, in the Intel Pentium Pro, the page global enable (PGE) flag in the register CR4 and the global (G) flag of a page-directory or page-table entry can be used to prevent frequently used pages from being automatically invalidated in the TLBs on a task switch or a load of register CR3. Since the 2010 Westmere microarchitecture Intel 64 processors also support 12-bit &quot;process-context identifiers&quot; (PCIDs), which allow retaining TLB entries for multiple linear-address spaces, with only those that match the current PCID being used for address translation.

While selective flushing of the TLB is an option in software-managed TLBs, the only option in some hardware TLBs (for example, the TLB in the Intel 80386) is the complete flushing of the TLB on an address-space switch. Other hardware TLBs (for example, the TLB in the Intel 80486 and later x86 processors, and the TLB in ARM processors) allow the flushing of individual entries from the TLB indexed by virtual address.

Flushing of the TLB can be an important security mechanism for memory isolation between processes to ensure a process can&#x27;t access data stored in memory pages of another process. Memory isolation is especially critical during switches between the privileged operating system kernel process and the user processes – as was highlighted by the Meltdown security vulnerability. Mitigation strategies such as kernel page-table isolation (KPTI) rely heavily on performance-impacting TLB flushes and benefit greatly from hardware-enabled selective TLB entry management such as PCID.

==Virtualization and x86 TLB==
With the advent of virtualization for server consolidation, a lot of effort has gone into making the x86 architecture easier to virtualize and to ensure better performance of virtual machines on x86 hardware.

Normally, entries in the x86 TLBs are not associated with a particular address space; they implicitly refer to the current address space. Hence, every time there is a change in address space, such as a context switch, the entire TLB has to be flushed. Maintaining a tag that associates each TLB entry with an address space in software and comparing this tag during TLB lookup and TLB flush is very expensive, especially since the x86 TLB is designed to operate with very low latency and completely in hardware. In 2008, both Intel (Nehalem) and AMD (SVM) have introduced tags as part of the TLB entry and dedicated hardware that checks the tag during lookup. Not all operating systems made full use of these tags immediately, but Linux 4.14 started using them to identify recently used address spaces, since the 12-bits PCIDs (4095 different values) are insufficient for all tasks running on a given CPU.

<doc id="528360" wikidata="Q6913214" url="?curid=528360" title="Moroiso">
<text>Moroiso (諸磯) is the name of an inlet in the Miura Peninsula south of Tokyo in Japan.

== Prehistory ==
Moroiso was settled by Jōmon people by at least 3,000 BCE. Evidence from that period have been found, including sedentary to semi-sedentary housing, pottery, stone tools and fishing implements. Moroiso became the archeological name for the Early Jōmon period of Japanese prehistory corresponding to the Moroiso pottery style, dated to around 5.000 years before present. The Moroiso period also coincides with the hypsithermal interval, the warmest period since the last glaciation, when sea levels were around 6 meters higher than today.

==History==
During historic times, the rugged and hilly Moroiso coastline, together with the adjoining Aburatsubo inlet, was selected by the feudal Miura clan to build a series of fortifications, with the Arai castle at its center. During the warring period of Sengoku, the castle fell after a 3-year siege to the rival Hōjō samurai family, in the year 1516. The Hōjō later managed to unify most of the Kantō area around Tokyo.

==World War II==
Late of the Second World War in 1945, the Japanese Navy selected the Misaki Marine Biological Station of the University of Tokyo at Moroiso as training school and harbour for a fleet of Kamikaze midget submarines, the &quot;Kairyu&quot; (海龍 &quot;Sea Dragons&quot;). They were supposed to be employed in suicide bombing missions against the US Navy ships during its final approach to Tokyo, but the war ended before any of them could see action.

After the war, the facility was returned to the university and is still visible today.

== Today ==
Moroiso harbours a small fishing community and a few hundred pleasure boats on moorings or stored on the ground. With the neighbouring Aburatsubo inlet, Moroiso has been considered as the birthplace of modern recreational sailing in Japan.

Due to the lack of space on the water inside the inlet itself, many boats are stored on the ground, typically using an adapted forklift system which allows to put on the water boats up to 40 ft, in a matter of minutes.

<text>David Lincoln Rabinowitz (born 1960) is an American astronomer, discoverer of minor planets and researcher at Yale University.

== Career ==
David Rabinowitz has built CCD cameras and software for the detection of near-Earth and Kuiper belt objects, and his research has helped reduce the assumed number of near-Earth asteroids larger than 1 km by half, from 1,000–2,000 to 500–1,000. He has also assisted in the detection of distant solar system objects, supernovae, and quasars, thereby helping to understand the origin and evolution of the Solar System and the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe.

Collaborating with Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo of the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team, he has participated in the discovery of several possible dwarf planets such as 90377 Sedna (possibly the first known inner Oort cloud object), 90482 Orcus, Eris (more massive than Pluto), , and , though no-one would get credit for Haumea.

Together with Tom Gehrels of the University of Arizona and his Spacewatch team, Rabinowitz discovered or co-discovered other astronomical objects including 5145 Pholus – a Centaur, credited by the MPC to Spacewatch– and the unnumbered Apollo near-Earth object 1991 BA, which remains uncredited.

== Awards and honors ==

The minor planet 5040 Rabinowitz, a Phocaea asteroid discovered by Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory in 1972, was named in his honor and for his work at Spacewatch.

== List of discovered minor planets ==
David Rabinowitz is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery and co-discovery of 34 minor planets during 1989–2010.



1992AD is with a comet-like orbit of 92.26 years without a tail, which orbits between Saturn and Neptune. It was discovered by Rabinowitz in 1992 and was officially named Pholus. Another body that he discovered in 1993 was named Nessus with an orbit of 123.2 years. This one orbits between Saturn and Pluto.

<doc id="528368" wikidata="Q815126" url="?curid=528368" title="Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia">
<text>Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia (; born 17 July 1945), is the head of the House of Karađorđević, the former royal house of the defunct Kingdom of Yugoslavia and its predecessor the Kingdom of Serbia. Alexander is the only child of King Peter II and his wife, Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. He held the position of crown prince in the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia for the first four-and-a-half months of his life, until the declaration of the Federal People&#x27;s Republic of Yugoslavia later in November 1945, when the monarchy was abolished. In public he claims the crowned royal title of &quot;Alexander II Karadjordjevic&quot; () as a pretender to the throne.

Born and raised in the United Kingdom, he enjoys close relationships with his relatives in the British royal family. His godparents were King George VI of the United Kingdom and his daughter, the then-Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II). Through his father, Alexander is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandfather Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Victoria&#x27;s second eldest son. Maternally, he is also a direct descendant of Queen Victoria, through his great-great-grandmother Victoria, German Empress, Victoria&#x27;s eldest daughter. Alexander is known for his support of constitutional monarchism and his humanitarian work.

==Status at birth==
As with many other European monarchs during World War II, King Peter II left his country to establish a government-in-exile. He left Yugoslavia in April 1941 and arrived in London in June 1941. The Royal Yugoslav Armed Forces capitulated in 18 April.

After the Tehran Conference, the Allies shifted support from royalist Chetniks to communist-led Partisans. Commenting on the event and what happened to his father, Crown Prince Alexander said, &quot;He [Peter II] was too straight. He could not believe that his allies – the mighty American democracy and his relatives and friends in London – could do him in. But that&#x27;s precisely what happened&quot;. In June 1944, Ivan Šubašić, the Royalist prime minister, and Josip Broz Tito, the Communist Partisan leader, signed an agreement that was an attempt to merge the royal government and communist movement.

On 29 November 1943, AVNOJ (formed by the Partisans) declared themselves the sovereign communist government of Yugoslavia and announced that they would take away all legal rights from the Royal government. On 10 August 1945, less than a month after Alexander&#x27;s birth, AVNOJ named the country Democratic Federal Yugoslavia. On 29 November 1945, the country was declared a communist republic and changed its name to People&#x27;s Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

In 1947, all members of Alexander&#x27;s family except for his grand-uncle Prince George were deprived of their Yugoslav citizenship and their property was confiscated.

As of 8 July 2015 the High Court in Belgrade found that decree 392, issued by the Presidency of the Presidium of the National Assembly on 3 August 1947, which deprived King Peter II and other members of the House of Karađorđević of their citizenship, was null and void from the moment of its adoption, in the parts pertaining to Crown Prince Alexander, and that all of its legal consequences are thus null and void.

==Birth and childhood==

Alexander was born in Suite 212 of Claridge&#x27;s Hotel in Brook Street, Mayfair, London. The British Government is said to have temporarily ceded sovereignty over the suite in which the birth occurred to Yugoslavia so that the crown prince would be born on Yugoslav territory, though the story may be apocryphal, as there exists no documentary record of this. Another part of the story says that a box of soil from the homeland was placed under the bed, so the Prince could be born on Yugoslav soil. It is now Suite 214 and known as the &#x27;Alexander Suite&#x27;.

He was the only child of King Peter II and Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia. He was christened on 24 October 1945 at Westminster Abbey. His godparents were members of the British royal family, King George VI and Princess Elizabeth, who later became Queen Elizabeth II.

His parents were relatively unable to take care of him, due to their various health and financial problems, so Alexander was raised by his maternal grandmother, Princess Aspasia of Greece and Denmark. He was educated at Trinity School, Institut Le Rosey, Culver Military Academy, Gordonstoun, Millfield and Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot, and pursued a career in the British military.

==Military service==
Alexander graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1966 and was commissioned as an officer into the British Army&#x27;s 16th/5th The Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers regiment, rising to the rank of captain. His tours of duty included West Germany, Italy, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland. After leaving the army in 1972, Alexander, who speaks several languages, pursued a career in international business.

==Personal life==
On 1 July 1972 at Villamanrique de la Condesa, near Seville, Spain, he married Princess Maria da Gloria of Orléans-Bragança (b. 1946) from the Brazilian imperial family. They are double 4th cousins once removed as both are descendants of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1785–1851) and his wife Princess Maria Antonia von Koháry (1797–1862), as well as of Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil and his wife, Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria. They have three sons: Peter (born 5 February 1980), and fraternal twins: Philip and Alexander (both born 15 January 1982).

Alexander and Maria da Gloria divorced on 19 February 1985. Both of them married for the second time. Maria da Gloria married Ignacio de Medina, Duke of Segorbe (b. 1947), while Crown Prince Alexander married Katherine Clairy Batis, the daughter of Robert Batis and his wife, Anna Dosti, civilly on 20 September 1985, and religiously the following day, at St. Sava Serbian Orthodox Church, Notting Hill, London. Since their marriage, she is known as Crown Princess Katherine, as per the royal family&#x27;s website.

On 16 December 2017, Alexander attended with his wife the state funeral of his first cousin once removed, King Michael of Romania in Bucharest, along with other heads of European royal families and invited guests.

On 19 September 2022, Crown Prince Alexander and his wife Katherine attended the state funeral of his godmother Queen Elizabeth II.

On 6 February 2024, following the news about King Charles&#x27; health, Alexander himself revealed that he had been treated for early-stage prostate cancer in December 2023.

==Return to Yugoslavia==

Alexander first came to Yugoslavia in 1991. He actively worked with the opposition to Slobodan Milošević and moved to Yugoslavia after Milošević had been deposed in 2000.

On 27 February 2001, the parliament of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) passed legislation conferring citizenship on members of the Karađorđević family. The legislation may also have effectively annulled a decree stripping the family of its citizenship of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) in 1947.

The annulment was the topic of some debate. Notably, the FRY was not the successor of the SFRY; rather the FRY was a new state (and was admitted to the United Nations as a new state on that basis). Therefore, the jurisdiction of a new state to annul an action of a different former state was questioned. In effect, the Karađorđević family had FRY citizenship conferred upon them, not &quot;restored&quot; as such.

The FRY legislation also addresses restoration of property to the Karađorđević family. In March 2001, the property seized from his family, including royal palaces, was returned for residential purposes with property ownership to be decided by parliament at some later date. 

He has lived since 17 July 2001 in the Royal Palace (&quot;Kraljevski Dvor&quot;) in Dedinje, an exclusive area of Belgrade. The Palace, which was completed in 1929, is one of two royal residences in the Royal Compound; the other is the White Palace, which was completed in 1936.

===Belief in constitutional monarchy===
Alexander is a proponent of re-creating a constitutional monarchy in Serbia and sees himself as the rightful king. He believes that monarchy could give Serbia &quot;stability, continuity and unity&quot;.

A number of political parties and organizations support a constitutional parliamentary monarchy in Serbia. The Serbian Orthodox Church has openly supported the restoration of the monarchy. The assassinated former Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Đinđić was often seen in the company of the prince and his family, supporting their campaigns and projects, although his Democratic Party never publicly embraced monarchy.

Crown Prince Alexander has vowed to stay out of politics. He and Princess Katherine spend considerable time engaging in humanitarian work.

The Crown Prince has, however, increasingly participated in public functions alongside the leaders of Serbia, the former Yugoslav republics and members of the diplomatic corps. On 11 May 2006, he hosted a reception at the Royal Palace for delegates attending a summit on Serbia and Montenegro. The reception was attended by the Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, as well as ambassadors and diplomats from Slovenia, Poland, Brazil, Japan, United States, and Austria. He later delivered a keynote speech in front of prime ministers Vojislav Koštunica and Milo Đukanović. In the speech he spoke of prospective Serbian membership of the European Union. He told delegates:

Following Montenegro&#x27;s successful independence referendum on 21 May 2006, the re-creation of the Serbian monarchy found its way into daily political debate. A monarchist proposal for the new Serbian constitution has been published alongside other proposals. The document approved in October 2006 is a republican one. The Serbian people have not had a chance to vote on the system of government.

The Crown Prince raised the issue of a royal restoration in the immediate aftermath of the vote. In a press release issued on 24 May 2006 he stated:

In 2011 an online open access poll by Serbian middle-market tabloid newspaper Blic showed that 64% of Serbians support restoring the monarchy. Another poll in May 2013 had 39% of Serbians supporting the monarchy, with 32% against it. The public also had reservations with Alexander&#x27;s apparent lack of knowledge of the Serbian language. On 27 July 2015, newspaper Blic published a poll &quot;Da li Srbija treba da bude monarhija?&quot; (&quot;Should Serbia be a monarchy?&quot;); 49.8% respondents expressed support in a reconstitution of monarchy, 44.6% were opposed and 5.5% were indifferent.

In 2017 an NGO, the Kingdom of Serbia Association announced that in 2016 they had collected over 123,000 signatures of support for a referendum on Alexander being named king, short of the 150,000 needed to force a constitutional amendment.

<text>Questia was an online commercial digital repository of books and articles that had an academic orientation, with a particular emphasis on books and journal articles in the humanities and social sciences. All the text in all the Questia books and articles were available to subscribers; the site also included integrated research tools. It was founded in 1998 and ceased operations in December 2020.

==Company history==
Questia, based in Chicago, Illinois, was founded in 1998 and purchased by Gale, part of Cengage Learning, in January 2010.

==Service==
Questia offered some information free of charge, including several public domain works, publication information, tables of contents, the first page of every chapter, Boolean searches of the contents of the library, and short bibliographies of available books and articles on some 6,500 topics.

Questia did not sell ownership to books or ebooks, but rather sold monthly or annual subscriptions that allowed temporary online reading access to all 94000+ books, and 14 million + journal, magazine, and newspaper articles in their collection. The books were selected by academic librarians as credible, authoritative works in their respective areas. The librarians also compiled about 7000 reference bibliographies on frequently researched topics. The library was strongest in books and journal articles in the social sciences and humanities, with many older historical texts. Original pagination was maintained. The Questia service also featured tools to automatically create citations and bibliographies, helping writers to properly cite the materials.

A limitation to the Questia library was that new additions were available in a &quot;beta&quot; version only. Unlike Questia&#x27;s earlier publications, these prevented users from copying text directly from the website, although one page from the publications could be printed free of charge. A charge was made for printing a range of pages.

Questia launched their Q&amp;A blog on September 21, 2011. Q&amp;A was divided into &quot;Education news,&quot; &quot;Student resources&quot; and &quot;Subjects&quot; categories. &quot;Subjects&quot; was further broken down so readers could find specific content based on their academic needs.

Questia released an iPhone app in 2011, which was extended to the iPad the following year. Then in January 2013 Questia launched tutorials, including videos and quizzes, to teach students the research process.

==Criticism==
Questia was criticized in 2005 by librarian Steven J. Bell for referring to itself as an academic library, when it concentrated on the liberal arts and treated users as customers rather than students. Moreover, Bell argued, Questia did not employ academic librarians or faculty. Although some of its employees had advanced library degrees, they did not work or collaborate with faculty to develop collections that served distinctive student populations.

<text>The Chiltern Hundreds is an ancient administrative area in Buckinghamshire, England, composed of three ancient hundreds and lying partially within the Chiltern Hills. &quot;Taking the Chiltern Hundreds&quot; refers to one of the legal fictions used to effect resignation from the British House of Commons. Since Members of Parliament are not permitted to resign, they are instead appointed to an &quot;office of profit under the Crown&quot;, which requires MPs to vacate their seats. The ancient office of Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Chiltern Hundreds, having been reduced to a mere sinecure by the 17th century, was first used by John Pitt (of Encombe) in 1751 to vacate his seat in the House of Commons. Other titles were also later used for the same purpose, but only those of the Chiltern Hundreds and the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead are still in use.

==Three Chiltern Hundreds==

A hundred is a traditional division of an English county: the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says that the etymology is &quot;exceedingly obscure&quot;. The three Chiltern Hundreds were Stoke Hundred, Desborough Hundred, and Burnham Hundred. The area had been Crown property as early as the 13th century.

==Steward and bailiff==

===Original role===
Through the Saxon and early Norman periods the area was administered by an elder. But by the late Middle Ages the office holder was elected from among a hundred&#x27;s notable landholding families. As the area was wild and notorious for outlaws, a steward and bailiff was appointed directly by the Crown (thus as a royal bailiwick it was a legal office answerable to the reigning monarch) to maintain law and order. However, by the end of the 16th century such positions had been overtaken by changes in local and Crown representations and roles – the government of Elizabeth I had established royal representatives (Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and Lords Lieutenant) in every county of England and Wales; they ensured that Royal commands and laws were obeyed. By the 17th century the office of steward and bailiff had been reduced to just a title with no attached powers or duties.

===Resignation from the House of Commons===

In the 17th century Members of Parliament (MPs) were often elected against their will. On 2 March 1623, a resolution was passed by the House of Commons making it illegal for an MP to quit or wilfully give up his seat. Believing that officers of the Crown could not remain impartial, the House passed a resolution on 30 December 1680 stating that an MP who &quot;shall accept any Office, or Place of Profit, from the Crown, without the Leave of this House ... shall be expelled [from] this House.&quot; However, MPs were able to hold Crown Stewardships until 1740, when Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn was deemed to have vacated his Commons seat after becoming Steward of the Lordship and Manor of Bromfield and Yale.

The post of &quot;Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham&quot; remained a nominal office of profit under the Crown, even though it had lost its original significance. It became the first office to be used for resignation when John Pitt was appointed Crown Steward on 25 January 1751. A number of other offices have also been used, but only the Chiltern Hundreds and the Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead are still in use.

<doc id="528386" wikidata="Q7101797" url="?curid=528386" title="Organic act">
<text>In United States law, an organic act is an act of the United States Congress that establishes an administrative agency or local government, for example, the laws that established territory of the United States and specified how are is to be governed, or established agency to manage certain federal lands. In the absence of organic law, the body of laws that define and establish a government, a territory is classified as unorganized.

The first such act was the Northwest Ordinance, passed in 1787 by the U.S. Congress of the Confederation (under the Articles of Confederation, predecessor of the United States Constitution). The Northwest Ordinance created the Northwest Territory in the land west of Pennsylvania and northwest of the Ohio River and set the pattern of development that was followed for all subsequent territories. The Northwest Territory covered more than 260,000 square miles and included all of the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and the northeastern part of Minnesota.

The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 incorporated Washington, D.C., and placed it under the exclusive control of the United States Congress.

The Organic Act for the Territory of New Mexico was part of the Compromise of 1850, passed September 9, 1850. Primarily concerned with slavery, the act organized New Mexico as a territory, with boundaries including the areas now embraced in New Mexico, Arizona, and southern Colorado.

<text>Sir Michael David Kadoorie, GBS (born 1941) is a Hong Kong billionaire businessman, and the chairman and 18% owner of CLP Group, Hong Kong&#x27;s largest electricity producer. He also owns 47% of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels. He is a member of the Kadoorie family.

==Early life==
Born in 1941, to the Jewish Kadoorie family, the son of business tycoon Lawrence Kadoorie (1899–1993) and his wife, Muriel Gubbay, Kadoorie was educated at Kowloon Junior School in Hong Kong, as well as Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. His family&#x27;s roots in business in the Far East go back to his grandfather Elly Kadoorie, a descendant of Iraqi Jews originally from Baghdad, who first settled in Shanghai in 1880. After a spell in Bombay, British India, his grandfather made a fortune in Shanghai, mostly lost in 1949, and later, in Hong Kong through finance, real estate and utilities. Headquartered in Hong Kong soon after 1949, Kadoorie&#x27;s father and uncle Horace Kadoorie expanded the family businesses into a diversified group, led by the company flagship CLP Holdings Ltd.

==Career==
Kadoorie is the chairman of CLP Holdings Ltd. which his family founded in 1890 and in which they still hold a 35% stake. The utility company provides electricity to 75% of Hong Kong as sole operator (licensed through a Scheme of Control) in Kowloon and the New Territories, and has equity interests in power plants in China, Southeast Asia, Australia and India.

He is also the chairman of the family&#x27;s second largest listed group, Hong Kong and Shanghai Hotels, owners and operators of the Peninsula Hotel Group. He controls and is a director of Metrojet Ltd, Heliservices (HK) Ltd, and has initiated CLP Research Institute (a subsidiary of CLP Holdings which looks into renewable energy development).

He holds a number of directorships in non-Kadoorie companies. He was a member of the Council of the University of Hong Kong and, in 2000, the Kadoorie Biological Sciences Building opened at the university.

==Awards==
A trustee of the Kadoorie Charitable Foundation, Kadoorie was made an Officer of the Legion of Honour by the government of France and a Commander of the Order of Léopold II of Belgium. He was awarded a knighthood, as a Knight Bachelor, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in June 2005. In 2004, the University of Hong Kong awarded him an honorary doctorate.

==Car collector==

A photography buff, Kadoorie is also a helicopter pilot and a collector of classic cars. He is the owner of a number of rare automobiles, including a Bugatti Type 57, a 1932 Rolls-Royce Phantom II by Thrupp &amp; Maberly, a 1934 Hispano-Suiza J12 Vanvooren Cabriolet, a 1969 Lamborghini Miura P400 S, a 1924 Vauxhall 30–98 Tourer, a Talbot T150 CSS Pourtout coupé (ex car of race driver &quot;Pagnibon&quot;), a Rolls-Royce Phantom III with Gurney Nutting body, and a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost.

In 1998, he spent two months recovering from serious injuries at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England after an accident in his vintage Ferrari when the spokes in two of the rebuilt wheels tore through the tyres.

==Personal life==
Michael Kadoorie lived in Hong Kong with his Cuban-American wife, Betty Tamayo, known as &quot;Lady Betty&quot;, until her death in Houston, Texas on 20 June 2021. They have three children: Natalie, Bettina, and Philip.

His sister, Rita Laura Kadoorie, is married to fellow Hong Kong billionaire Ronald McAulay.

<text>The Markeaton Park Light Railway was a gauge light railway line located within Markeaton Park in the city of Derby, Derbyshire, England. The railway was first opened in 1989, extended in 1996, and closed down in September 2016.

==Description==
The line was long. The railway was privately owned and staffed and maintained by volunteers. The main station, Markeaton Station, was located at the Ashbourne Road/Queensway entrance to the park, next to the car park, in buildings formerly occupied by the British Army. On operating days, trains ran every 25 minutes to Mundy Halt at the Mundy Play Centre. Trains ran at about .

==History==

From 1989 until 1996, when the railway was purchased by John Bull, the motive power was a 4-wheeled petrol-hydraulic locomotive named &quot;Invicta&quot;. The carriages were two open &quot;toastrack&quot; vehicles, largely built by the original owner. From 1996 until the summer of 2009 the railway operated a steam locomotive &quot;Markeaton Lady&quot; which was built by the Exmoor Steam Railway in 1996. She was a and was purchased and operated by John Bull, the final owner of the Markeaton Park railway. It was sold in 2009 due as her boiler needed replacement and the owner could not afford to undertake the work. The locomotive now operates at Evesham Vale Light Railway, where it carries the name &quot;Monty&quot;.

In 2002, the line purchased with a replica British Rail Baby Deltic diesel locomotive from the gauge Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway. After an overhaul the locomotive started operating on the line in 2003. The locomotive had been supplied new to the Steamtown miniature railway at Carnforth before moving to Cleethorpes. The line used three coaches built by Exmoor, and three ex-Fairbourne coaches which were modified and re-gauged.

An industrial style diesel locomotive originally built by Ruston and Hornsby and rebuilt by Alan Keef which had run at Markeaton before, named &quot;Cromwell&quot;, was anticipated to join the railway again in 2010, but this did not take place.

During 2010 the railway was put up for sale, but this was retracted during the 2010 winter period.

Markeaton Park Light Railway operated for the last time on Sunday 18 September 2016. Major maintenance work was required to repair the engine shed and depot, which had been the responsibility of Derby City Council. The council were unable to fund the required repairs. The track was subsequently removed, with the exception of some concrete level crossings. The locomotive and carriages were sold to the Lappa Valley Steam Railway after closure.

<doc id="528393" wikidata="Q337624" url="?curid=528393" title="Acala">
<text>&#x27; or Achala (, &quot;The Immovable&quot;, ), also known as &#x27; (, &quot;Immovable Lord&quot;) or  (, &quot;Noble Immovable Lord&quot;), is a wrathful deity and &quot;dharmapala&quot; (protector of the Dharma) prominent in Vajrayana Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism.

Originally a minor deity described as a messenger or acolyte of the buddha Vairocana, Acala later rose to prominence as an object of veneration in his own right as a remover of obstacles and destroyer of evil, eventually becoming seen as the wrathful manifestation of either Vairocana, the buddha Akṣobhya, or the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. In later texts, he is also called &#x27; (, &quot;Violent Wrathful One&quot;, ) or &#x27; (, &quot;Violent One of Great Wrath&quot;, ), the names by which he is more commonly known in countries like Nepal and Tibet.

In East Asian esoteric Buddhism, Acala is classed among the Wisdom Kings () and is preeminent among the five Wisdom Kings of the Womb Realm. Accordingly, he occupies an important hierarchical position in the Mandala of the Two Realms. In China, he is known as Bùdòng Míngwáng (不動明王, &quot;Immovable Wisdom King&quot;, the Chinese translation of Sanskrit &quot;Acala(nātha) Vidyārāja&quot;), while in Japan, he is called Fudō Myōō, the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; reading of his Chinese name. Acala (as Fudō) is one of the especially important and well-known divinities in Japanese Buddhism, being especially venerated in the Shingon, Tendai, Zen, and Nichiren sects, as well as in Shugendō.

Acala has been worshiped throughout the Middle Ages and into modern times in Nepal, Tibet, China and Japan, where sculptural and pictorial representations of him are most often found.

==Origins and development==
Acala first appears in the (不空羂索神変真言經, pinyin: &quot;Bùkōng juànsuǒ shénbiàn zhēnyán jīng&quot;, translated by Bodhiruci circa 707-709 CE), where he is described as a servant or messenger of the buddha Vairocana:The first from the west in the northern quadrant is the acolyte Acala (不動使者). In his left hand he grasps a noose and in his right hand he holds a sword. He is seated in the half-lotus position.

More well-known, however, is the following passage from the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; (also known as the &quot;Mahāvairocanābhisaṃbodhi Tantra&quot; or the &quot;Vairocana Sūtra&quot;) which refers to Acala as one of the deities of the Womb Realm Mandala:

The deity was apparently popular in India during the 8th-9th centuries as evident by the fact that six of the Sanskrit texts translated by the esoteric master Amoghavajra into Chinese are devoted entirely to him. Indeed, Acala&#x27;s rise to a more prominent position in the Esoteric pantheon in East Asian Buddhism may be credited in part to the writings of Amoghavajra and his teacher Vajrabodhi.

While some scholars have put forward the theory that Acala originated from the Hindu god Shiva, particularly his attributes of destruction and reincarnation, Bernard Faure suggested the wrathful esoteric deity Trailokyavijaya (whose name is an epithet of Shiva), the Vedic fire god Agni, and the guardian deity Vajrapani to be other, more likely prototypes for Acala. He notes: &quot;one could theoretically locate Acala&#x27;s origins in a generic , but only in the sense that all Tantric deities can in one way or another be traced back to .&quot; Faure compares Acala to Vajrapani in that both were originally minor deities who eventually came to occupy important places in the Buddhist pantheon.

Acala is said to be a powerful deity who protects the faithful by burning away all impediments () and defilements (), thus aiding them towards enlightenment. In a commentary on the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; by Yi Xing, he is said to have manifested in the world following Vairocana&#x27;s vow to save all beings, and that his primary function is to remove obstacles to enlightenment. Indeed, the tantra instructs the ritual practitioner to recite Acala&#x27;s mantras or to visualize himself as Acala in order to remove obstacles.

From a humble acolyte, Acala evolved into a powerful demon-subduing deity. In later texts such as the &quot;Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Tantra&quot;, Acala - under the name (&quot;Violent Wrathful One&quot;) or (&quot;Violent One of Great Wrath&quot;) - is portrayed as the &quot;frightener of gods, titans, and men, the destroyer of the strength of demons&quot; who slays ghosts and evil spirits with his fierce anger. In the &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot;, the gods Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and Kandarpa - described as &quot;wicked&quot; beings who subject humanity to endless rebirth - are said to be terrified of Acala because he carries a rope to bind them.

In Tibetan Buddhism, Acala or Miyowa (མི་གཡོ་བ་, Wylie: &quot;mi g.yo ba&quot;) is considered as belonging to the &quot;&quot; (&quot;vajra family&quot;, Tibetan: དོ་རྗེའི་རིགས་, &quot;dorjé rik&quot;; Wylie: &quot;rdo rje&#x27;i rigs&quot;), one of the Five Buddha Families presided over by the buddha Akṣobhya and may even be regarded, along with the other deities of the &quot;kula&quot;, as an aspect or emanation of the latter. He is thus sometimes depicted in South Asian art wearing a crown with an effigy of Akṣobhya. In Nepal, Acala may also be identified as a manifestation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. He has a consort named Viśvavajrī in both the Nepalese and Tibetan traditions, with whom he is at times depicted in yab-yum union.

By contrast, the &quot;sanrinjin&quot; (三輪身, &quot;bodies of the three wheels&quot;) theory, based on Amoghavajra&#x27;s writings and prevalent in Japanese esoteric Buddhism (&quot;Mikkyō&quot;), interprets Acala as an incarnation of Vairocana. In this system, the five chief &quot;vidyārājas&quot; or Wisdom Kings (明王, &quot;Myōō&quot;), of which Acala is one, are interpreted as the wrathful manifestations (教令輪身, &quot;kyōryōrin-shin&quot;, lit. &quot;&quot;embodiments of the wheel of injunction&quot;) of the Five Great Buddhas, who appear both as gentle bodhisattvas to teach the Dharma and also as fierce wrathful deities to subdue and convert hardened nonbelievers. Under this conceptualization, &quot;vidyārājas&quot; are ranked superior to , a different class of guardian deities. However, this interpretation, while common in Japan, is not necessarily universal: in Nichiren-shū, for instance, Acala and Rāgarāja (Aizen Myōō), the two &quot;vidyārājas&quot; who commonly feature in the mandalas inscribed by Nichiren, are seen as protective deities (外護神, &quot;gegoshin&quot;) who respectively embody the two tenets of &quot;hongaku&quot; (&quot;original enlightenment&quot;) doctrine: &quot;life and death (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;) are precisely &quot;nirvana&quot;&quot; (生死即涅槃, &quot;shōji soku nehan&quot;) and &quot;worldly passions (&quot;kleśa&quot;) are precisely enlightenment (&quot;bodhi&quot;)&quot; (煩悩即菩提, &quot;bonnō soku bodai&quot;).

== Iconography ==
The &quot;Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Tantra&quot; description of Acala is a good summary of the deity&#x27;s depiction in South Asian Buddhist art.

In Nepalese and Tibetan art, Acala is usually shown either kneeling on his left knee or standing astride, bearing a noose or lasso (&quot;pāśa&quot;) and an upraised sword. Some depictions portray him trampling on the elephant-headed Vighnarāja (lit. &quot;Ruler of Hindrances&quot;, a Buddhist equivalent to the Hindu god Ganesha, albeit interpreted negatively as one who causes obstacles), signifying his role as the destroyer of impediments to enlightenment. He may also be shown wearing a tiger skin, with snakes coiled around his arms and body.

By contrast, portrayals of Acala (Fudō) in Japan generally tend to conform to the description given in the &quot;Amoghapāśakalparāja Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot;: holding a lasso and a sword while sitting or standing on a rock (盤石座, &quot;banjakuza&quot;) or a pile of hewn stones (瑟瑟座, &quot;shitsushitsuza&quot;), with his braided hair hanging from the left of his head. He may also be depicted with a lotus flower - a symbol of enlightenment - on his head (頂蓮, &quot;chōren&quot;). Unlike the South Asian Acala, whose striding posture conveys movement and dynamism, the Japanese Fudō sits or stands erect, suggesting motionlessness and rigidity. The sword he wields may or may not be flaming and is sometimes described generically as a or , which is descriptive of the fact that the sword&#x27;s pommel is in the shape of the talon-like vajra (金剛杵, &quot;kongō-sho&quot;). It may also be referred to as a . In some cases, he is seen holding the &quot;Kurikara sword&quot; (倶利伽羅剣, &quot;Kurikara-ken&quot;), a sword with the dragon (&quot;nāga&quot;) king Kurikara (倶利伽羅; Sanskrit: &quot;Kulikāla-rāja&quot; or &quot;Kṛkāla-rāja&quot;) coiled around it. The flaming nimbus or halo behind Acala is commonly known in Japanese as the &quot;Garuda flame&quot; (迦楼羅炎, &quot;karura-en&quot;) after the mythical fire-breathing bird from Indian mythology.

There are two main variations in the iconography of Acala / Fudō in Japan. The first type (observable in the earliest extant Japanese images of the deity) shows him with wide open, glaring eyes, straight hair braided in rows and two fangs pointed in the same direction; a lotus flower rests above his head. The second type (which first appeared in the late 9th century and became increasingly common during the late Heian and Kamakura periods), by contrast, portrays Acala with curly hair, one eye wide open and/or looking upwards, with the other narrowed and/or looking downwards, an iconographic trait known as the &quot;tenchigan&quot; (天地眼), &quot;heaven-and-earth eyes&quot;. Similarly, one of his fangs is now shown as pointing up, with the other pointing down. In place of the lotus flower, images of this type may sport seven topknots.

Although the squinting left eye and inverted fangs of the second type ultimately derives from the description of Acala given in the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; and Yi Xing&#x27;s commentary on the text (&quot;with his lower [right] tooth he bites the upper-right side of his lip, and with his left [-upper tooth he bites] his lower lip which sticks out&quot;), these attributes were mostly absent in Chinese and earlier Japanese icons.

Acala&#x27;s mismatched eyes and fangs were allegorically interpreted to signify both the duality and nonduality of his nature (and of all reality): the upward fang for instance was interpreted as symbolizing the process of elevation towards enlightenment, with the downward fang symbolizing the descent of enlightened beings into the world to teach sentient beings. The two fangs also symbolize the realms of buddhas and sentient beings, yin and yang, and male and female, with the nonduality of these two polar opposites being expressed by Acala&#x27;s tightly closed lips.
Acala is commonly shown as having either black or blue skin (the &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot; describes his color as being &quot;like that of the &quot;atasī&quot; (flax) flower,&quot; which may be either yellow or blue), though he may be at times portrayed in other colors. In Tibet, for instance, a variant of the kneeling Acala depiction shows him as being white in hue &quot;like sunrise on a snow mountain reflecting many rays of light&quot;. In Japan, some images may depict Acala sporting a red (赤不動, &quot;Aka-Fudō&quot;) or yellow (黄不動, &quot;Ki-Fudō&quot;) complexion. The most famous example of the &quot;Aka-Fudō&quot; portrayal is a painting kept at Myōō-in on Mount Kōya (Wakayama Prefecture) traditionally attributed to the Heian period Tendai monk Enchin. Legend claims that Enchin, inspired by a vision of Acala, painted the image using his own blood (thus explaining its red color), though recent analysis suggests that the image may have been actually created much later, during the Kamakura period. The most well-known image of the &quot;Ki-Fudō&quot; type, meanwhile, is enshrined in Mii-dera (Onjō-ji) at the foot of Mount Hiei in Shiga Prefecture and is said to have been based on another vision that Enchin saw while practicing austerities in 838. The original Mii-dera &quot;Ki-Fudō&quot; is traditionally only shown to esoteric masters (&quot;ācārya&quot;; 阿闍梨, &quot;ajari&quot;) during initiation rites and is otherwise not shown to the public, though copies of it have been made. One such copy, made in the 12th century, is kept at Manshu-in in Kyoto.

The deity is usually depicted with one head and two arms, though a few portrayals show him with multiple heads, arms or legs. In Japan, a depiction of Acala with four arms is employed in subjugation rituals and earth-placating rituals (安鎮法, &quot;anchin-hō&quot;); this four-armed form is identified in one text as &quot;the lord of the various categories [of gods].&quot; An iconographic depiction known as the &quot;Two-Headed Rāgarāja&quot; (両頭愛染, &quot;Ryōzu Aizen&quot; or &quot;Ryōtō Aizen&quot;) shows Acala combined with the wisdom king Rāgarāja (Aizen).

=== Acolytes ===

Acala is sometimes described as having a retinue of acolytes, the number of which vary between sources, usually two or eight but sometimes thirty-six or even forty-eight. These represent the elemental, untamed forces of nature that the ritual practitioner seeks to harness.

The two boy servants or &quot;dōji&quot; (童子) most commonly depicted in Japanese iconographic portrayals are and , who also appear as the last two of the list of Acala&#x27;s eight great &quot;dōji&quot;. Kiṃkara is depicted as white in color, with his hands joined in respect, while Ceṭaka is red-skinned and holds a vajra in his left hand and a vajra staff in his right hand. The two are said to symbolize both Dharma-essence and ignorance, respectively, and is held to be in charge of good and evil.

Kiṃkara and Ceṭaka are also sometimes interpreted as transformations or emanations of Acala himself. In a sense, they reflect Acala&#x27;s original characterization as an attendant of Vairocana; indeed, their servile nature is reflected in their names (&quot;Ceṭaka&quot; for instance means &quot;slave&quot;) and their topknots, the mark of banished people and slaves. In other texts, they are also described as manifestations of Avalokiteśvara (Kannon) and Vajrapāṇi or as transformations of the dragon Kurikara, who is himself sometimes seen as one of Acala&#x27;s various incarnations.

Two other notable &quot;dōji&quot; are Matijvala (恵光童子, &quot;Ekō-dōji&quot;) and Matisādhu (恵喜童子, &quot;Eki-dōji&quot;), the first two of Acala&#x27;s eight great acolytes. Matijvala is depicted as white in color and holds a three-pronged vajra in his right hand and a lotus topped with a moon disk on his left, while Matisādhu is red and holds a trident in his right hand and a wish-fulfilling jewel (&quot;cintāmaṇi&quot;) on his left. The eight acolytes as a whole symbolize the eight directions, with Matijvala and Matisādhu representing east and south, respectively.

== Texts ==

As noted above, Acala appears in the &quot;Amoghapāśakalparāja Sūtra&quot; and the &quot;Vairocanābhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot;. As Caṇḍaroṣaṇa or Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa, he is the primary deity of the &quot;Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa Tantra&quot; and is described in the &quot;Sādhanamālā&quot;.

The Japanese esoteric Buddhist tradition and Shugendō also make use of the following apocryphal sutras on Acala:

* &quot;Sūtra of the Great Wrathful King Āryācala&#x27;s Secret Dhāraṇī&quot; (聖無動尊大威怒王秘密陀羅尼経, &quot;Shō-Mudō-son daiifunnuō himitsu darani kyō&quot;)
: A sūtra consisting of a discourse on Acala given by the bodhisattva Vajrasattva (identified here with Samantabhadra) to Mañjuśrī, set in &quot;Vairocana&#x27;s great assembly.&quot; The sutra describes Acala as being identical with the all-pervading &quot;dharmakāya&quot;, &quot;[having] no fixed abode, but [dwelling] within the hearts of sentient beings&quot; (無其所居、但住衆生心想之中).
* &quot;Āryācala Sūtra&quot; (仏説聖不動経, &quot;Bussetsu Shō-Fudō kyō&quot;)
: A summarized version of the above sutra. Translated into English, it runs as follows:
:
: To this text is often appended two litanies of the names of Acala&#x27;s young acolytes (童子, &quot;dōji&quot;), the &#x27;thirty-six &quot;dōji&quot;″ (三十六童子, &quot;sanjuroku dōji&quot;) and the &#x27;eight great &quot;dōji&quot;″ (八大童子, &quot;hachi daidōji&quot;).
* &quot;Sūtra on Reverencing the Secret Dhāraṇī of Āryācala&quot; (稽首聖無動尊秘密陀羅尼経, &quot;Keishu Shō-Mudō-son himitsu darani kyō&quot;)

== Bīja and mantra ==

The &quot;bīja&quot; or seed syllables used to represent Acala in Japanese Buddhism are &#x27; (हां / हाँ) and hāmmāṃ (हाम्मां / हाम्माँ), the latter being a combination of the two final &quot;bīja&quot; in his mantra: hāṃ māṃ&quot; (हां मां&quot;&#x27;). &quot;Hāṃ&quot; is sometimes confounded with the similar-looking (हूं), prompting some writers to mistakenly identify Acala with other deities. The syllables are written using the Siddham script and is conventionally read as &quot;kān&quot; (カーン) and &quot;kānmān&quot; (カーンマーン).

Three mantras of Acala are considered to be the standard in Japan. The most widely known one, derived from the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; and popularly known as the &quot;Mantra of Compassionate Help&quot; (慈救呪, &quot;jikushu&quot; or &quot;jikuju&quot;), goes as follows:
The &quot;Short Mantra&quot; (小呪, &quot;shōshu&quot;) of Acala - also found in the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; - is as follows:

The longest of the three is the &quot;Great Mantra&quot; of Acala, also known as the &quot;Fire Realm Mantra&quot; (火界呪, &quot;kakaishu&quot; / &quot;kakaiju&quot;):

Another mantra associated with the deity is &quot;Oṃ caṇḍa-mahā­roṣaṇa hūṃ phaṭ&quot;, found in the &quot;Siddhaikavīra Tantra&quot;. The text describes it as the &quot;king of mantras&quot; that dispels all evil and grants &quot;whatever the follower of Mantrayāna desires&quot;.

== Worship ==
=== Japan ===

Fudō Myōō (Acala), was never popular in Indian, Tibetan or even Chinese Buddhism, but in Japan it became the object of a flourishing cult with esoteric overtones.

The cult of Acala was first brought to Japan by the esoteric master Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon school, and his successors, where it developed as part of the growing popularity of rituals for the protection of the state. While Acala was at first simply regarded as the &quot;primus inter pares&quot; among the five wisdom kings, he gradually became a focus of worship in his own right, subsuming characteristics of the other four &quot;vidyarāja&quot;s (who came to be perceived as emanating from him), and became installed as the main deity (&quot;honzon&quot;) at many temples and outdoor shrines.

Acala, as a powerful vanquisher of evil, was regarded both as a protector of the imperial court and the nation as a whole (in which capacity he was invoked during state-sponsored rituals) and the personal guardian of ritual practitioners. Many eminent Buddhist priests like Kūkai, Kakuban, Ennin, Enchin, and Sōō worshiped Acala as their patron deity, and stories of how he miraculously rescued his devotees in times of danger were widely circulated.

At temples dedicated to Acala, priests perform the , or ritual service to enlist the deity&#x27;s power of purification to benefit the faithful. This rite routinely involves the use of the as a purification tool.

Lay persons or monks in &quot;yamabushi&quot; gear who go into rigorous training outdoors in the mountains often pray to small Acala statues or portable talismans that serve as his &quot;honzon&quot;. This element of yamabushi training, known as Shugendō, predates the introduction of Acala to Japan. At this time, figures such as , who appeared before the sect&#x27;s founder, En no Gyōja, or Vairocana, were commonly worshiped. Once Acala was added to list of deities typically enshrined by the yamabushi monks, his images were either portable, or installed in &quot;hokora&quot; (outdoor shrines). These statues would often be placed near waterfalls (a common training ground), deep in the mountains and in caves.

The daimyo Takeda Shingen is known to have taken Fudō Myōō as his patron (particularly when he transitioned to being a lay monk in his later years), and has commissioned a statue of Fudō that is supposedly modelled after his face.

Acala also tops the list of Thirteen Buddhas. Thus Shingon Buddhist mourners assign Fudō to the first seven days of service. The first week is an important observance, but perhaps not as much as the observance of &quot;seven times seven days&quot; (i.e. 49 days) signifying the end of the &quot;intermediate state&quot; (bardo).

Literature on Shingon Buddhist ritual will explain that Sanskrit &quot;seed syllables&quot;, mantras and mudras are attendant to each of the Buddhas for each observance period. But the scholarly consensus seems to be that invocation of the &quot;Thirteen Buddhas&quot; had evolved later, around the 14th century and became widespread by the following century, so it is doubtful that this practice was part of Kūkai&#x27;s original teachings.

=== China ===
Bùdòng Míngwáng (Acala) worship in China was first introduced into China during the Tang dynasty after the translation of esoteric tantras associated with him by monks such as Amoghavajra and Vajrabodhi. Iconography of Acala has been depicted infrequently in some temples and grottoes from the Tang through to contemporaneous times, usually as part of a set depicting the Eight Wisdom Kings or Ten Wisdom Kings, In modern times, he is revered as one of the eight Buddhist guardians of the Chinese zodiac and specifically considered to be the protector of those born in the year of the Rooster. He is also frequently invoked during Chinese Buddhist repentance ceremonies, such as the Liberation Rite of Water and Land, along with the other Wisdom Kings where they are given offerings and intreated to expel evil from the ritual platform.
== In popular culture ==
* Gary Snyder&#x27;s 1969 poem &quot;Smokey the Bear Sutra&quot; portrays Smokey Bear (the mascot of the U.S. Forest Service) as an incarnation of Vairocana (the &quot;Great Sun Buddha&quot;) in a similar vein as Acala. Indeed, Acala&#x27;s Mantra of Compassionate Help is presented in the text as Smokey&#x27;s &quot;great mantra.&quot;
* Sailor Mars from the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; series invokes Acala through the Sanskrit chant of the Mantra of Compassionate Help during her &quot;Fire Soul Bird&quot; attack. Acala is flashed multiple times as a shadowed figure in flames, consistent with Japanese iconography, and in line with Sailor Mars&#x27;s element of fire.

<text>Julian Fernando Casablancas (born August 23, 1978) is an American musician. He is the lead vocalist and primary songwriter of the rock band the Strokes, with whom he has released six studio albums since their founding in 1998. Casablancas released a solo studio album, &quot;Phrazes for the Young&quot;, in 2009, and has released three albums with the experimental rock band the Voidz.

A native New Yorker, he was born to businessman John Casablancas. His mother, Jeanette Christiansen, married a man who introduced him to the music of the band the Doors, introducing him to rock music. He met bassist Nikolai Fraiture at the age of six, and attended a Swiss boarding school where he met guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. He did not complete high school, but received a GED.

After meeting guitarist Nick Valensi and drummer Fab Moretti at Dwight School in Manhattan, New York the group began experimenting with music together. After adding Hammond Jr., the Strokes were formed. Their debut album &quot;Is This It&quot; was critically acclaimed, and launched Casablancas and the band to rock stardom. Casablancas was the primary songwriter and creative voice behind the band&#x27;s early albums, including 2003&#x27;s &quot;Room on Fire&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;. After a six-year hiatus, the Strokes released &quot;Angles&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Comedown Machine&quot; in 2013 with the band taking a more collaborative approach to these projects. Casablancas would not record another record with the band until 2020&#x27;s Grammy-winning &quot;The New Abnormal&quot;, the first such nomination or win for the band.

During a five-year hiatus for the band, Casablancas released his debut solo album, &quot;Phrazes for the Young&quot;. In the same year he founded the independent record label Cult Records, which has represented artists the Growlers, Rey Pila and Karen O.

Since 2013, he has been the frontman of experimental rock band the Voidz. The band has released three studio albums, &quot;Tyranny&quot; (2014) , &quot;Virtue&quot; (2018) and &quot;Like All Before You&quot; (2024). The band represents an ambition of Casablancas to make less commercial music and explore new themes.

== Early life ==
Julian Fernando Casablancas was born in New York City on August 23, 1978, the son of American-Spanish businessman John Casablancas, the founder of Elite Model Management, and Jeanette Christiansen (née Christjansen), a Danish model and the 1965 Miss Denmark who later became an artist. When Julian was eight, his parents divorced. He said that he wanted to be closer to his father, which &quot;translated into teenage rebelliousness&quot;. His mother later married Ghanaian painter Sam Adoquei, who helped shape Julian&#x27;s musically by exposing him to music like the Doors, which was markedly different from the mostly Phil Collins-influenced music he listened to as a child. Prior to becoming a musician, he aspired to play professional basketball. 

Julian Casabancas has several half-siblings, including an elder sister from his father&#x27;s first marriage, and three other siblings from his father&#x27;s third marriage. Julian met future Strokes bassist Nikolai Fraiture when they were six years old, while they both attended the bilingual French school Lycée Français de New York. When he was 13, his father sent him to the Institut Le Rosey boarding school in Switzerland, to improve his grades, where he met future Strokes guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr. Julian later returned to New York City and attended Dwight School with two other future Strokes bandmates: guitarist Nick Valensi and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Julian never finished high school, but took the GED and enrolled in music classes at Five Towns College, which he later said was the first time that he enjoyed himself in class. He later attended Adelphi University class of 2001, studying with Pulitzer prize winning composer Paul Moravec.

== Career ==

=== The Strokes (1998–present) ===
After meeting future guitarist Nick Valensi and drummer Fab Moretti at Dwight School in Manhattan, Julian Casablancas began to play music with them. He reconnected with guitarist Albert Hammond Jr. when the latter moved to New York. The band was formed in 1998 when Hammond was accepted into the band, with Casablancas as the lead vocalist and main songwriter and Nikolai Fraiture on bass.

The band began rehearsing a fourteen-song set which included &quot;Alone, Together&quot;, &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;New York City Cops&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; and &quot;This Life&quot; (an early version of &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot;). Most of these songs now feature different lyrics. A demo sent to the newly reformed Rough Trade Records in the UK sparked interest there, leading to their first release via the website of the UK magazine &quot;NME&quot;, who gave away a free mp3 download of &quot;Last Nite&quot; a week prior to the physical release as part of &quot;The Modern Age EP&quot; in 2001. The EP sparked a bidding war among record labels, the largest for a rock and roll band in years. Shortly after, the Strokes&#x27; critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Is This It&quot; was released.

The band has received the highest of praise for &quot;Is This It&quot;, setting the stage for what people expected would &quot;save rock&quot; in the new millennium. Though some would argue that such statements left unreasonably sized shoes to fill, the Strokes are still highly recognized as one of the most influential garage rock bands of the early 2000s, paving the way for many alternative bands to come.

However, the group found it difficult to replicate their early critical success. In an excerpt from Lizzie Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City, 2001–2011 –&quot; named after the Strokes&#x27; track – Strokes guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr., comments, &quot;With &quot;Room on Fire&quot; [2003], people were giving us sh_ because they said we were sounding too much the same. With the third album [&quot;First Impressions of Earth&quot;], we were getting sh_ that we don&#x27;t sound like &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. We got __ by the same thing twice!&quot;

After the release of the two other albums and several major tours, the band took a five-year break, returning with their fourth album &quot;Angles&quot; in 2011. The five-year hiatus was said to be the result of conflicting solo projects, sobriety issues, and unspoken emotions. The Strokes&#x27; drummer Fab Moretti said the band struggled to process such &quot;subconscious volcanic emotions&quot;, partly because they were still &quot;children&quot; at the time.

Although their creative processes have been critiqued by outside observers as &quot;a democracy under a dictator&quot;, Casablancas said in 2010 that the band was moving &quot;more in the direction of everyone being equal.&quot; Commenting on Casablancas&#x27; creative process, guitarist Nick Valensi has said, &quot;his ear is so sharp. He&#x27;s the one with the ear for detail in this band. Creatively, he is a force to be reckoned with.&quot; The 2011 release, &quot;Angles,&quot; is said to reflect the beginning of the more collaborative nature of the band&#x27;s creative process.

The album release was followed by several headlining appearances at musical festivals, including Reading, Coachella, Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits. The band released &quot;Comedown Machine&quot; in 2013, as their last album under the contract with long-time label RCA, for which they did no promotion. The band released an EP, &quot;Future Present Past&quot;, on Casablancas&#x27; own label Cult Records in 2016.

In December 2018, it was announced that the band would headline at Bilbao BBK Live in 2019, kicking off their global comeback. Numerous dates for festivals and shows were subsequently announced, including a show at the Governors Ball Music Festival, marking the band&#x27;s return to New York City.

Starting May 14, 2019, the Strokes teased some new songs, starting with &quot;The Adults are Talking&quot;, live at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, suggesting that the Strokes might release a new album. On December 31, 2019, at Brooklyn NYE, they performed &quot;Ode to the Mets&quot; as an offer from Casablancas to sing live instead of singing songs from &quot;Angles&quot; as requested by fans. &quot;I don&#x27;t remember &quot;Angles&quot;. What&#x27;s &quot;Angles&quot;?&quot; Casablancas responded before suggesting that the band play the new song and later confirming the release of a new project.

The band released the album &quot;The New Abnormal&quot; in April 2020, though writing sessions for songs on the album started as early as 2016. The following year, there was rumors that they were working with Rick Rubin for a new album, however Albert Hammond Jr. said they were only presenting ideas to him. However, he would eventually end up producing the album. It was their first full-length album since &quot;Comedown Machine.&quot; The album won the band their first Grammy Award, receiving the award for Best Rock Album. The album received positive reviews from critics, suggesting that the band came back with more maturity and better cohesion among the bandmates.

=== Cult Records ===
In 2009, Casablancas founded Cult Records, the creative imprint for his solo album &quot;Phrazes for the Young&quot;. The label signed a partnership agreement with Kobalt Label Services in 2014, which includes representation and product management, physical distribution across multiple territories, digital distribution through AWAL, marketing and sync licensing services. Cult currently represents the Growlers, Har Mar Superstar, Songhoy Blues, Rey Pila, Karen O, Promiseland, the Strokes, the Voidz, Exhibition and Cerebral Ballzy. The label has also released works of Albert Hammond Jr., the Virgins, Reputante, INHEAVEN, Exclamation Pony and Nelson London (C O L O R).

Casablancas served as a co-producer on Rey Pila&#x27;s album released on Cult, &quot;The Future Sugar&quot;. In August 2016, Cult Records announced a new album with the Growlers, a Southern California-based band. It was also announced that Casablancas himself was producing the album, later known as &quot;City Club&quot;.

=== Solo projects (2009–present) ===
As a solo artist, Casablancas set out with an intention to say what was on his mind, both musically and lyrically. Speaking on his experience as a solo artist versus releasing music with the Strokes, the singer has put it simply, &quot;it&#x27;s like touring with me or with five of me,&quot; meaning that each member has their own opinionated state of mind. While such statements raised much concern for the relations between the band members, Casablancas says that in pursuit of a solo career, he is protecting the integrity of the [Strokes] vibe. In having a musical project separate from the Strokes, he is able to &quot;chase down any idea [he] wants&quot;, which he would refrain from doing with the band.

His first solo album, &quot;Phrazes for the Young&quot; (inspired by the Oscar Wilde book &quot;Phrases and Philosophies for the Use of the Young&quot;), was released on November 2 in the UK and November 3, 2009, in the United States. Recorded in Omaha, Nebraska, and New York, the album was produced by Jason Lader, with additional production from Bright Eyes&#x27; Mike Mogis. The album was strongly influenced by new wave and electronica, with Casablancas utilizing synthesizers for many songs. He discussed his new styling by saying &quot;I would&#x27;ve gone weirder with the music, but I wanted to be smart. I didn&#x27;t want people to say, &#x27;Okay, this is his weird abstract thing,&#x27; and dismiss the album. I worked too hard on it for that to happen... I wanted to be crazy original and bridge the gap between traditional music and modern music.&quot;

Julian Casablancas made his live solo debut for a private party for the introduction of a fashion brand in Tokyo. To celebrate the release of the EP, he performed a series of shows in October 2009 at The Downtown Palace Theatre in Los Angeles with his live show band, the Sick Six. Members of the band included Jeff Kite (keyboard), Nelson London (synthesizer), JP Bowersock (guitar), Danielle Haim (percussion) and Alex Carapetis (drums). Casablancas then toured with the Sick Six in Europe, United States, Australia, and Japan from November 2009 until July 2010.

Casablancas composed the original song &quot;I Like the Night&quot; as part of his endorsement deal to represent Azzaro&#x27;s new men&#x27;s fragrance Decibel, dB. The Azzaro Decibel television commercial featuring Julian aired in France on September 1, 2011. He hosted a monthly music show &quot;Culture Void&quot; on Sirius XMU between May 2016 and February 2017, where he curated and shared some music across genres.

=== The Voidz (2013–present) ===
The Voidz, formerly known as Julian Casablancas + the Voidz, was formed in 2013. Along with Casablancas as lead vocalist, the band consists of Jeramy &quot;Beardo&quot; Gritter and Amir Yaghmai on guitar, Jacob &quot;Jake&quot; Bercovici on bass (as well as synthesizer), Alex Carapetis on drums and percussion, and Jeff Kite on keyboard. Wanting to earn a greater sense of respect as a band, rather than be perceived as a &quot;side-project&quot; of Julian&#x27;s, the band officially changed their name from &quot;Julian Casablancas + the Voidz&quot; to simply &quot;the Voidz&quot; during an &#x27;initiation&#x27; video on the band&#x27;s YouTube page on December 8, 2017. Julian performed with Carapetis and Kite throughout the tour for his solo album, &quot;Phrazes for the Young&quot;. Through Carapetis, Casablancas met Gritter and Bercovici. Bercovici, having played music with Yaghmai for several of years, then connected him to Casablancas, forming what is now known as the Voidz.

Though the band&#x27;s sound has not always been well received, the Voidz aim to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; between music that is both aggressive and complex. They share the goal of &quot;representing things unseen&quot; and &quot;exploring [music] from the margins&quot;, as Jake [Bercovici] has said. Inspired by the complex nature of Middle Eastern music scales, Casablancas says he is more interested in &quot;the in between notes&quot; than the traditional seven note scale of Western music. The band is bound by a mutual love for powerful music that does not gain much attention in mainstream media, which is embodied in Julian&#x27;s record company, Cult Records, as well. Casablancas says his work with the Voidz is simply an &quot;evolution of the same mission&quot; [as with the Strokes], but the Voidz are more aligned with the type of music with which he would like to experiment, moving forward. Though the Voidz remain a more active musical entity, both bands are still currently represented under Cult Records.

In June 2014, Casablancas announced he would be releasing the debut album &quot;Tyranny&quot;. The album was released on his own label Cult Records and coincided with his move to Upstate New York. On September 23, 2014, the album was released, followed by a tour in the United States and United Kingdom. The album features the 11-minute single &quot;Human Sadness&quot;, a song whose demo was originally composed for the soundtrack of &quot;The Unseen Beauty&quot;, a short documentary film which profiled Casablancas&#x27; stepfather, artist Sam Adoquei. The group revealed dates for a South American tour in August 2017.

On March 30, 2018, the Voidz released their second album, titled &quot;Virtue&quot;. The album takes on a more political stance, dissecting universal concepts such as the paradox between what is perceived as &quot;truth&quot; and &quot;lies&quot;, when taking multiple perceptual view points into consideration. The album features track, &quot;Pyramid of Bones&quot;, which was featured on Adult Swim in April 2018, along with their single &quot;Coul as a Ghoul&quot; on the Adult Swim&#x27;s Singles Program.

The Voidz released their third album &quot;Like All Before You&quot; on September 20 2024. The album&#x27;s themes were once again political in nature with Casablancas seeking to fuse experimental sounds and ideas with pop hooks. 

=== Collaborations ===
Casablancas, along with the Strokes, provided vocals on a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)&quot; with Joshua Homme on drums and Eddie Vedder on backup vocals. The cover was released in 2006 as the B-side to &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;. Casablancas also provided bass guitar and backing vocals on Albert Hammond, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Scared&quot; on his solo album &quot;Yours to Keep&quot;. He subsequently played a Casio guitar and provided backing vocals on &quot;Sick, Sick, Sick&quot; by Queens of the Stone Age.

In 2008, he recorded a song with Santigold (then known as Santogold) and Pharrell of N*E*R*D titled &quot;My Drive Thru&quot; for a Converse advertising campaign. During his solo phase, he recorded &quot;Boombox&quot; with Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer of the Lonely Island for their 2009 debut album &quot;Incredibad&quot;, and was featured in an SNL Digital Short for the same song. In addition, he also recorded &quot;I Wish It Was Christmas Today&quot;, a festive song based on a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; skit made popular by Jimmy Fallon, Horatio Sanz, Chris Kattan and Tracy Morgan. Casablancas performed the song live on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on December 21, 2009, together with the Roots, Horatio Sanz and Jimmy Fallon. He also appeared in the 100th Digital Short, which aired on May 12, 2012.

Casablancas also collaborated with Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse on the song &quot;Little Girl&quot; on the 2010 album, &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot;, contributing the lyrics, lead and backing vocals, and guitar solo. Aside from vocal collaborations, he also contributed to the song &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; on Digitalism&#x27;s sophomore album &quot;I Love You, Dude&quot; in 2011. The electronica duo initiated a collaboration with Casablancas through his manager, and Casablancas contributed &#x27;a 30-second recording with him on guitar&#x27; via email.

Casablancas also lent his vocals to the title track, &quot;Rave On&quot;, on a 2011 tribute album to Buddy Holly, &quot;Rave On Buddy Holly&quot;. In 2016, Casablancas contributed three specially recorded the Velvet Underground and Lou Reed covers – &quot;Venus in Furs&quot;, &quot;Run Run Run&quot; and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, under the title &quot;White Light White Heat (rock n roll animal live era version)&quot; – to the HBO television series, &quot;Vinyl&quot;. The songs were subsequently released on various soundtracks to the series by Atlantic Records.

Casablancas worked with Daft Punk on their 2013 album &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; by contributing lyrics, vocals, and a guitar solo to their song &quot;Instant Crush&quot;. The album won the 2013 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, with Casablancas as one of the co-recipients of the award. Another collaboration between Casablancas and Daft Punk written during the recording sessions of &quot;Random Access Memories&quot; was spoken about by Casablancas in several interviews following the album&#x27;s release. This song &quot;Infinity Repeating (2013 Demo)&quot;, also featuring the Voidz, would eventually release on the 10th anniversary edition of the album.

In April 2015, it was revealed that Casablancas had worked on a song with Savages&#x27; Jehnny Beth. The collaboration was later announced to be a cover of &quot;Boy/Girl,&quot; a 1983 duet by Danish punk band Sort Sol and Lydia Lunch. The music video, directed by Warren Fu, was released on December 4, 2015. The 7&quot; was released through both Cult Records and Pop Noire Records on December 18, 2015. Casablancas also wrote the song &quot;Youth Without Love&quot; for Har Mar Superstar&#x27;s 2016 album &quot;Best Summer Ever&quot;, and is featured on &quot;No One There&quot;, a song by Indian-born musician, Hammarsing Kharhmar (Exhibition).

In 2015, Julian also made an appearance on Leftöver Crack&#x27;s album, Constructs of the State. His vocals can be heard on the song Vicious Constructs. The song is sung by both Casablancas and Leftöver Crack lead singer Stza Crack(Scott Sturgeon).

On October 4, 2024, Charli XCX announced the collaborators for her remix album Brat and It&#x27;s Completely Different but Also Still Brat, Julian being featured amongst them. On October 5th, the track list was revealed and showed he would be featured on the remix of &quot;Mean girls&quot;. In the buildup to the release of the album on [DATE], she remarked that when it comes to his style, she thinks &quot; he of all people understands how to capture that kind of an energy in a room and on the songs. It was definitely crazy pulling that all together.&quot; The album eventually released through Atlantic Records on October 11, 2024. The musical styling of the song ended up being closer to his recent work with the Voidz, having an electronic style reminiscent of his solo work.

== Musical influences and legacy ==
Casablancas cites the Doors as one of his earliest musical influences, though he specifies that he was influenced by their musical style rather than the public image of their vocalist and frontman Jim Morrison. He has also cited Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground as a major influence on his lyrics and singing style. He stated in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, &quot;The way Lou Reed wrote and sang about drugs and sex, about the people around him — it was so matter-of-fact. He could be romantic in the way he portrayed these crazy situations, but he was also intensely real. It was poetry and journalism.&quot; Additionally, he has stated that Bob Marley, Nirvana, and Pearl Jam are major influences on his work, even referring to the Pearl Jam song &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; as the reason he started making music. He also, in agreement with several of his Voidz bandmates, named Stevie Wonder as a composer with a &quot;next level mind&quot;.

Casablancas has served as inspiration for several other musicians including Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys and the painter Elizabeth Peyton. Courtney Love&#x27;s song &quot;But Julian, I&#x27;m a Little Bit Older Than You&quot; from her debut solo album &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetheart&quot; (2004) was written about Casablancas.

== Personal life ==
In 2005, Casablancas married Juliet Joslin, who was the assistant manager of the Strokes at the time. Their son, Cal, was born in January 2010. In the early 2010s, Casablancas and his family moved to Upstate New York from Greenwich Village in Manhattan. Their second son, Zephyr, was born on March 27, 2015. The couple divorced in 2019. By 2020, Casablancas had moved to Los Angeles, although in 2024 he confirmed he had since moved back to New York, having concluded that “[the] quality of life is higher in LA, and the quality of art is higher in New York, with respect to both.&quot; 

Casablancas maintained a teetotal lifestyle from 2009 until 2022, stating that he was once &quot;[hung over] for five years&quot; during his drinking days.

Casablancas is a lifelong fan of the New York Mets, once even composing new theme music for SNY, who owns the Mets&#x27; local broadcasting rights, and offering it to the network for free. He has named Darryl Strawberry and Mike Piazza among his favorite players in franchise history. He has also expressed admiration for Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, going so far as to &quot;quit [watching] sports&quot; following the New York Jets&#x27; selection of Sam Darnold over Allen in the 2018 NFL draft.

=== Politics ===
Although he has named the 2004 re-election of George W. Bush as what first motivated his interest in politics, it was only throughout the 2010s that Casablancas became increasingly vocal about his political concerns. He has expressed a belief that &quot;whoever&#x27;s propaganda&#x27;s the loudest&quot; determines popularity within politics and music alike. He is an ardent supporter of independent media and has also shown support for the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Casablancas has cited Oliver Stone, Chris Hedges, Noam Chomsky, Jesse Ventura, and Howard Zinn as political influences, Martin Luther King Jr. as his favorite philosopher, and Paul Robeson as a role model for politically engaged musicians.

In 2016, Casablancas interviewed Henry Giroux for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2019, he appeared in conversation with Giroux at McMaster University and authored the foreword to Giroux&#x27;s &quot;The Terror of the Unforeseen&quot;.

In September 2018, Casablancas appeared on Lee Camp&#x27;s show &quot;Redacted Tonight&quot; on Russian state-funded network RT America. The following month, Camp opened for the Voidz at a show in Houston, Texas. 

Casablancas endorsed Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and on the eve of the 2020 New Hampshire primary, the Strokes performed in support of Sanders at the University of New Hampshire. That October, shortly before the 2020 United States elections, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released the first episode of Casablancas&#x27; interview series &quot;S.O.S. – Earth is a Mess&quot;, which premiered periodically through 2021. Guests included Amy Goodman, Andrew Yang, Richard D. Wolff, and Noam Chomsky, while much of Casablancas&#x27; questioning centered on democratic reform and the influence of special interest groups on politics and the media.

Casablancas refused to vote in the 2024 US presidential election, saying &quot;The two parties are a joke – a horrible lie&quot; and that he &quot;[saw] little point in choosing between these puppets...&quot;.

<text>Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany (c. 1340 – 3 September 1420) was a member of the Scottish royal family who served as regent (at least partially) to three Scottish monarchs (Robert II, Robert III, and James I). A ruthless politician, Albany was widely regarded as having murdered his nephew, the Duke of Rothesay, and brother to the future King James I of Scotland. James was held in captivity in England for eighteen years, during which time Albany served as regent in Scotland, king in all but name. He died in 1420 and was succeeded by his son, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, who was executed for treason when James returned to Scotland in 1425, almost causing the complete ruin of the Albany Stewarts.

== Early life and ancestry ==
Robert Stewart was the third son of the future King Robert II of Scotland (1316–1390) and of Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan. His parents&#x27; marriage was deemed uncanonical at first, which, in some circles, gave their children and descendants the label of illegitimacy, but the granting of a papal dispensation in 1349 saw their remarriage and their children&#x27;s legitimisation. Robert&#x27;s grandfather was Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland (1293–1326) and his father was the first monarch of the House of Stewart. His maternal great-grandfather was Robert the Bruce (1274–1329), legendary victor of the Battle of Bannockburn.

Robert Stewart was raised in a large family with many siblings. His older brother John Stewart (1337–1406) became Earl of Carrick in 1368 and would later be crowned King of Scotland under the name Robert III.

In 1361 Stewart married Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith (1334–1380), a wealthy divorcee who took Robert as her fourth husband. His sister-in-law&#x27;s claim to the Earldoms of Menteith and Fife allowed him to assume those titles, becoming Earl of Menteith and Earl of Fife. In 1362 the couple had a son and heir, Murdoch Stewart (1362–1425), who would in time inherit his father&#x27;s titles and estates.

Stewart was responsible for the construction of Doune Castle, which remains largely intact today. When Stewart became Earl of Menteith, he was granted the lands on which Doune Castle now stands. Building may have started any time after this, and the castle was at least partially complete in 1381 when a charter was sealed here.

== Politics and war ==

Scottish politics in the late fourteenth century was unstable and bloody, and much of Albany&#x27;s career was spent acquiring territory, land and titles, often by violent means.

During the reign of their infirm father as King Robert II (1371–1390), Robert Stewart and his older brother Lord Carrick functioned as regents of Scotland, kings in all but name, with Albany serving as High Chamberlain of Scotland. He also led several military expeditions and raids into the Kingdom of England. Fife ensured at the December 1388 council meeting that the guardianship of Scotland would pass from Carrick (who had recently been badly injured from a horse-kick) to Fife. There was general approval of Fife&#x27;s intention to properly resolve the situation of lawlessness in the north and in particular the activities of Alexander, Earl of Buchan, Lord of Badenoch and Ross, his younger brother. Buchan was stripped of his position of Justiciar North of the Forth, which would soon be given to Fife&#x27;s son, Murdoch Stewart. Father and son would now work together to expand their family interest, bringing them into violent confrontation with other members of the nobility such as Donald McDonald, Lord of the Isles.

The Earl of Carrick acceded to the throne as King Robert III in 1390. His &quot;sickness of the body&quot; caused control of the kingdom to eventually devolve in 1399 to his son and heir apparent, David. In 1398 David had been created Duke of Rothesay and Robert had been created Duke of Albany, the first two dukedoms created in the Scottish Peerage. Power had begun to shift away from Albany and towards his nephew.

=== Murder of the Duke of Rothesay ===
However, the English soon invaded Scotland, and serious differences emerged between Albany and Rothesay. In 1401, Rothesay was accused of unjustifiably appropriating sums from the customs of the burghs on the east coast and confiscating the revenues of the temporalities of the vacant bishopric of St Andrews. Rothesay had also in conjunction with his uncle, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, confronted Albany&#x27;s influence in central Scotland — as soon his lieutenancy expired in 1402 Albany acted swiftly and ruthlessly. Rothesay was arrested and imprisoned in Albany&#x27;s Falkland Castle where he died in March 1402. Rothesay&#x27;s death probably lay with Albany and Douglas who would have looked upon the possibility of the young prince acceding to the throne with great apprehension. Albany certainly fell under suspicion but he was cleared of all blame by a general council, which found that&quot; &quot;by divine providence and not otherwise, it is discerned that he [Duke Rothesay] departed from this life&quot;. &quot;

However, even though Albany was exonerated from blame, suspicions of foul play persisted, suspicions which never left Rothesay&#x27;s younger brother the future James I of Scotland, and which would eventually lead to the downfall of the Albany Stewarts. John Debrett, writing in 1805, was in no doubt of Duke Robert&#x27;s motives and guilt:
:&quot;This Robert, Duke of Albany, having obtained the entire government from his brother, King Robert, he caused the Duke of Rothesay to be murdered, thinking to bring the Crown into his own family&quot;.

After Rothesay&#x27;s death, the King began to fear for his second son, James, who fled Scotland for his own safety. Debrett continues:
:&quot;to avoid the like fate, King Robert resolved to send his younger son James, to France, then about nine years old, who being sea-sick, and forced to land on the English coast ... was detained a captive in England eighteen years. At these misfortunes, King Robert died of grief in 1406.&quot;

=== Regent of Scotland ===

After the death of his brother, King Robert III, Albany ruled Scotland as regent. His young nephew, the future James I of Scotland, remained in exile and imprisonment in England for 18 years. Albany made little effort to secure the young Prince&#x27;s ransom and return to Scotland, focusing his energies instead on securing his own power and interest.

Albany&#x27;s political triumph did not settle his differences with the other members of the nobility, in particular Donald Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, who in 1411 led an army of clansmen from the Isles and Northwest Highlands into open battle with the Stewarts. This conflict began when Albany had attempted to secure the Earldom of Ross for his second son, John, despite Macdonald&#x27;s superior claim. At the Battle of Harlaw (known as &quot;Red Harlaw&quot; on account of its savagery) on 24 July 1411, losses were heavy on both sides, though Macdonald left with 9,000 men and the Earl of Mar and his lesser forces lay bleeding on the battlefield. The Lord of the Isles eventually prevailed in his claim to the Earldom of Ross.

The Stewart army was led by Albany&#x27;s nephew, Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar, who later sat on the jury of knights and peers which convicted Albany&#x27;s son Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany and two of his sons of treason, virtually annihilating the Albany Stewarts.

== Marriage and family ==
Albany married twice. Firstly, in 1361, he married Margaret Graham, Countess of Menteith (1334–1380), a wealthy divorcee who took him as her fourth husband. His sister-in-law&#x27;s claim to the Earldoms of Menteith and Fife allowed him to assume those titles after marriage. The couple had eight children, seven daughters and a son:
* Lady Janet Stewart (married Sir David de Moubray);
* Lady Mary Stewart (married Sir William Abernathy, 6th of Saltoun);
* Lady Margaret Stewart (married to Sir John Swinton, 14th of that Ilk and had descendants);
* Lady Joan Stewart (married Sir Robert Stewart, 1st Lord of Lorne and had descendants);
* Lady Beatrice Stewart (married Sir James Douglas of Balveny);
* Lady Isobel Stewart (married to Alexander Leslie, 7th Earl of Ross and later to Sir Walter de Haliburton, 1st Lord Haliburton of Dirleton and had descendants);
* Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany (1362–1425) (Married Joan Douglas and later to Isabel, Countess of Lennox);
* Lady Margery (married Sir Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell and had descendants).

Margaret died in 1380 and Albany subsequently married Muriella Keith, with whom he had three children:
* John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan (1381–1424); he fought in France against the English during the Hundred Years War, serving with distinction, but was killed at the Battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424;
* Robert Stewart, died without issue. (When his brother, John, Earl of Buchan, died in France in 1424, King James prevented Robert from inheriting Buchan&#x27;s lands, including Ross. Because he accepted his fate, he was one of the few Albany Stewarts to survive the fall of his kinsmen under James I.);
* Lady Elizabeth Stewart (married to Malcolm Fleming, ancestor of Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming).

== Death and legacy ==


The Duke of Albany died in 1420 in Stirling Castle and lies buried in Dunfermline Abbey in Fife. He was succeeded as Duke of Albany and Regent of Scotland by his son, Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. But Murdoch would not enjoy his power for long. In 1425, the exiled King James, captive in England for 18 years, finally returned to Scotland and executed Murdoch and most of his family for treason, causing the almost complete ruin of the Albany Stewarts.

Murdoch Stewart&#x27;s sole surviving male heir was his youngest son, James the Fat, who fled to Ireland after a brief rebellion against the King over the arrest of his father and brothers. James remained in Ireland, unable to return, and died there in 1429. He was never able to inherit his father&#x27;s titles, since they had been declared forfeit.

Albany&#x27;s great-grandson, James &quot;Beag&quot; Stewart (c. 1410–1470), would eventually secure a pardon from the King and return to Scotland, though the family would never recover their lost estates. James &quot;Beag&quot; Stewart is the ancestor of the Stewarts of Ardvorlich on Lochearnside, whose family history is recounted by Sir Walter Scott in A Legend of Montrose.

== Albany in fiction ==
Nigel Tranter&#x27;s &quot;Stewart Trilogy&quot; covers the period when Albany was an important figure in Scotland.

&quot;The Strongest Heart&quot; by Regan Walker, set between 1386 and 1412, covers the period when Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles, fought Albany for the earldom of Ross.

<doc id="528411" wikidata="Q459035" url="?curid=528411" title="List of birds of the Maldives">
<text>The following is a list of birds recorded in the Maldives. The small size and isolation of this Indian Ocean republic mean that its avifauna is extremely restricted. Most of the species are characteristic of Eurasian migratory birds, with only a few typically associated with the Indian subcontinent. The avifauna of the Maldives includes a total of 205 species, of which 4 have been introduced by humans. Four species are globally threatened.

The taxonomy (designation and sequence of orders, families, and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) of this list follow the conventions of &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for the Maldives.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. The commonly occurring native species do not fall into any of these categories.

* (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Maldives
* (I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Maldives as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions

<doc id="528416" wikidata="Q597936" url="?curid=528416" title="Albert Hammond Jr.">
<text>Albert Louis Hammond Jr. (born Albert Louis Hammond III; April 9, 1980) is an American musician who is a member of the rock band The Strokes. He is best known for his role as rhythm and lead guitarist, as well as occasionally a keyboard player and backing vocalist for the band. Hammond has released extensive solo work, including five solo albums.

Born in Los Angeles, Hammond is a first-generation American, his father the songwriter Albert Hammond being of British-Gibraltarian descent, and his mother being of Argentine descent. He attended the same Swiss boarding school as his bandmate Julian Casablancas, where the two became friends. He would move to New York City in 1998 and attended New York University for a year and a half.

Casablancas invited Hammond to join the Strokes in 1999, being the last member to join the band. He plays rhythm guitar on most songs, and has some songwriting credits on the more instrumental pieces. Hammond is passionate about fashion and is known for wearing a three-piece suit on tour. Casablancas credits him for influencing the band&#x27;s style. In 2009, he released a line of men&#x27;s suits.

In 2006, Hammond released his debut solo album &quot;Yours to Keep.&quot; and followed up with &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot; in 2008. Since then, he has released the 2013 EP &quot;AHJ,&quot; and the albums &quot;Momentary Masters&quot;, &quot;Francis Trouble&quot;, and Melodies on Hiatus in 2015, 2018, and 2023 respectively.

==Early life==
Hammond was born on April 9, 1980 in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of British-Gibraltarian singer-songwriter Albert Hammond, a prolific songwriter best known for his 1972 hit single &quot;It Never Rains in Southern California&quot;, and Argentine Claudia Fernández, a former model and beauty pageant winner. He has two older half-sisters. A first generation American, Hammond is of mixed Gibraltarian, Argentine, Austrian, and Peruvian descent; his first language was Spanish. Hammond began playing the guitar at age nine. He was a championship-winning roller skater as a child.

At the age of 12, Hammond was sent to boarding school Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. While there, he became friends with future Strokes bandmate Julian Casablancas, a grade above him, whom he connected with as a fellow American. Hammond moved back to Los Angeles where he completed his high school education at the Buckley School. Following graduation in 1998, Hammond moved from Los Angeles to New York City and, having deferred admittance to New York University, took a short-term filmmaking course at the New York Film Academy. He later attended NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, but left after a year and a half.

== Career ==

=== The Strokes ===

After moving to New York City in September 1998, Hammond reconnected with his former school friend Casablancas, who later invited him to join the Strokes. Made up of Casablancas&#x27; other schoolmates Nikolai Fraiture, Nick Valensi, and Fabrizio Moretti, Hammond was the last person to join the band in 1999. In the following two years, the band practiced and performed tirelessly, all while Hammond was also attending NYU and working at Kim&#x27;s Video. The Strokes released their first demo in January 2001, beginning a record label bidding war and years of critical acclaim. Since 2001, Hammond, as part of the Strokes, has released two EPs and six full-length albums, most recently &quot;The New Abnormal&quot; in 2020.

Hammond is usually seen playing a 1985 &#x27;70s reissue Olympic White Fender Stratocaster or Gibson Les Paul Jr. that is sometimes used by bandmate Nick Valensi. On the majority of the Strokes&#x27; songs he plays rhythm guitar, and solos are played by Valensi. The songs in which Hammond does play solos are &quot;Last Nite&quot;, &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot;, &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, &quot;Under Control&quot;, &quot;The End Has No End&quot;, &quot;Ize of the World&quot;, &quot;Threat of Joy&quot;, &quot;Vision of Division&quot;, and &quot;Drag Queen&quot;. His solos tend to focus largely on more emotional, &quot;bluesy&quot;-type melodic work, and the guitar tends to have a cleaner, softer tone in comparison to Valensi&#x27;s (with a notable exception found in &quot;Vision of Division&quot;). He often holds his guitar in a high horizontal position, similar to Buddy Holly, which he says is so that he can dance better.

Although vocalist Casablancas is the primary songwriter in the Strokes, Hammond co-wrote the track &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; with Casablancas for the group&#x27;s second album &quot;Room on Fire&quot;. He has been credited with writing three mostly instrumental songs (&quot;Swiss Beats&quot;, &quot;Holland&quot;, and &quot;By the Way&quot;) for the band&#x27;s 2001 tour video titled &quot;In Transit&quot;. These songs were reworked for his later solo album and have different titles (&quot;Everyone Gets a Star&quot;, &quot;Bright Young Thing&quot;, &quot;In Transit&quot;). He wrote &quot;Elephant Song&quot; when he was required to record a song for his Sound 101 class during his freshman year and used the school&#x27;s recording equipment. The song was played at a few shows before the release of the Strokes&#x27; debut album. They later re-recorded the song as a special giveaway for fan club members.

=== Solo career ===
==== &quot;Yours to Keep&quot; and &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot; (2006–2013) ====

In October 2005, Hammond and Ben Kweller released a version of &quot;Wait&quot; on &quot;This Bird Has Flown – A 40th Anniversary Tribute to the Beatles&#x27; Rubber Soul.&quot;

Hammond released a solo album titled &quot;Yours to Keep&quot; in the U.K. through Rough Trade Records on October 9, 2006 and in North America through New Line Records/Scratchie Records on March 6, 2007. Produced by Thin Lizard Dawn vocalist Lattimer and recorded at the Electric Lady Studios in New York City, the album features several musical guests, such as Sean Lennon, Ben Kweller, The Strokes&#x27; manager Ryan Gentles, Jody Porter of Fountains of Wayne, Chris Feinstein, Mikki James, Sammy James Jr. (The Mooney Suzuki) and the Strokes&#x27; lead singer, Casablancas. Bassist Josh Lattanzi and drummer Matt Romano serve as the backing band, with Hammond on guitar and vocals. The first single taken from the album, &quot;101,&quot; was released exclusively through iTunes on September 4, 2006. &quot;101&quot; was the follow-up single to &quot;Everyone Gets a Star&quot;. The music video debuted online in March 2007. It was going to be available in general music stores, unlike &quot;Everyone Gets A Star&quot; which was only available through UK iTunes Music Store. It was released on November 27, 2006. The music video for &quot;In Transit&quot; was directed by Joaquin Phoenix.

Hammond has said to have been &quot;waiting to make a record like this for years&quot;. Early support from his bandmates in the Strokes was only evident after Casablancas&#x27; role playing bass and back-up vocals on the track &quot;Scared&quot;, though all of the members (with the exclusion of Nick Valensi, who was busy taking care of his newborn children) attended his shows in and around New York.

On March 16, 2007, at the South by Southwest festival, Hammond performed a 12-song set including covers of Frank Black&#x27;s &quot;Old Black Dawning&quot; and Guided by Voices&#x27; &quot;Postal Blowfish&quot;. Hammond also regularly covered the Cars&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t Cha Stop&quot; in live performances. He supported Bloc Party on their world tour before making stops at Montreal&#x27;s Metropolis and Toronto&#x27;s Kool Haus. After this, Hammond headlined two North American tours along with a European tour. The North American tour featured his friends, the Mooney Suzuki. In November 2006, Hammond was announced to be joining Incubus on tour during their North American tour for their new album &quot;Light Grenades&quot;. On August 29, 2007, Hammond announced on MySpace that he was going back into the studio to record his second album in October 2007 for five weeks.

On March 20, 2008, Hammond posted a blog entry on MySpace in which he revealed the title of his second album: &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot; He wrote that it contained 13 songs with a total length of 46 minutes and 30 seconds. He stated he hoped to be touring with the new album until the end of 2008. On May 27, 2008, Hammond released &quot;GfC&quot;, the first single off &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot;, on iTunes in the U.S. The song was played extensively live on his 2007 tour. A non-album song titled &quot;&amp; So It Goes&quot; was released as a B-side along with the single. The album was released on July 7, 2008.

On May 29, 2008, Hammond was Myspace&#x27;s featured artist and exclusively premiered his new album &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot; uploading all the tracks of the album on his official Myspace page. He celebrated the release of his album with a July 8 small show at the Virgin Megastore, Union Square, in New York City. A noted absence from Hammond&#x27;s band was recording bassist Josh Latzanni. Steve Schiltz of the band Longwave, who toured with Hammond on his first album also was missing. Although Hammond was supposed to play only two or three songs, he ended up playing almost 10, with a selection that included both new and old tracks. This show kicked off his worldwide tour in support of &quot;¿Cómo Te Llama?&quot; with the next show being sold-out at the landmark venue Spaceland in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles. This was his only appearance on the West Coast. The following month, Hammond&#x27;s website officially announced that Hammond would be the support act of the British band Coldplay during their European Tour, which kicked off on September 1 in Strasbourg, France.

==== &quot;AHJ&quot; EP and &quot;Momentary Masters&quot; (2013–2017) ====

In an interview with Har Mar Superstar in July 2013, Hammond revealed that he had recorded a five-song EP to be released via Julian Casablancas&#x27; Cult Records. Titled &quot;AHJ&quot;, it was released on October 8, 2013. Hammond stated in an interview promoting the EP on December 5, 2013, that he would be interested in playing solo as an opening act if the Strokes announced another tour: &quot;I would definitely ask the guys if I could open for them. That&#x27;d be amazing.&quot;

On June 22, 2014, a photo was posted to Hammond&#x27;s official Facebook page of himself in a room with other musicians and the caption &quot;the start of something new; LP 3,&quot; suggesting that he is working on a third full-length album. Hammond released his third LP &quot;Momentary Masters&quot; on July 31, 2015 in the U.S. via Vagrant Records. The first single, &quot;Born Slippy&quot;, was made instantly available for streaming and download via YouTube and iTunes respectively. Both &quot;AHJ&quot; and &quot;Momentary Masters&quot; were produced with Hammond&#x27;s close collaborator Gus Oberg.

Hammond covered &quot;The Little Boy That Santa Claus Forgot&quot; by Vera Lynn mixed with the chorus from George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; as part of Amazon&#x27;s annual music series titled &quot;Indie for the Holidays&quot;. The song was released on December 1, 2017.

==== &quot;Francis Trouble&quot; (2018–present) ====
Hammond&#x27;s fourth solo album &quot;Francis Trouble&quot; was released via Red Bull Records on March 9, 2018. The first single &quot;Muted Beatings&quot; was released on February 2, 2018. In 2019 he released a new single, &quot;Fast Times,&quot; preceding a brief Western USA tour.&quot;&quot; That May, he released the single &quot;More to Life&quot;. The following year Albert was featured on the 2020 song &quot;Another Hit of Showmanship&quot; by the rock band the Struts.

== Artistry ==

=== Music ===
Guided by Voices, The Beach Boys, Buddy Holly, Frank Black, John Lennon, Matthew Sweet and The Velvet Underground are cited as Hammond&#x27;s musical influences.

Albert&#x27;s main guitar is a Fender Stratocaster Arctic White 1985 Reissue of a 1972. He owns three white Stratocasters, a Gibson Les Paul special single cutaway, a Rickenbacker 325, and a Gretsch hollowbody. His amplifier is a Fender Hot Rod DeVille 2x12. His pedal board is made up of an old version of the MXR Micro Amp, a V1 Jekyll and Hyde Ultimate Overdrive and Distortion, and a BOSS TU-2 tuner. In later shows, he adds another Micro Amp, and Jekyll and Hyde, and a Boss Digital Delay. He now uses a Mad Professor Deep Blue Delay pedal instead of the Boss Digital Delay.

=== Fashion ===
Hammond&#x27;s sartorial trademark is wearing formal three-piece suits, and has been said by bandmate Julian Casablancas to be the most influential on the band&#x27;s style. Hammond most recently collaborated with designer Amber Doyle for the Strokes&#x27; 2019 European tour. In a 2018 interview he stated that he&#x27;d had a passion for style from an early age, and has always combined his own designs with retail favorites. While Hammond has been best known for his formal wear, he launched his own range of &quot;Francis Trouble&quot; t-shirts and sports incorporated classic vintage tees.

In 2009, Hammond released his own line of men&#x27;s suits which he co-designed with stylist Ilaria Urbinati. The suits were at first only available at Urbinati&#x27;s soon-to-open Confederacy boutique in Los Angeles. Speaking about the designing endeavor, Hammond told &quot;New York&quot; magazine, &quot;I want to make suits that I&#x27;m going to have for myself. They&#x27;re for the person who needs his one suit for a wedding. He&#x27;d rather get something like this than go to Men&#x27;s Wearhouse, pay the same amount, and look like an out-of-date parent.&quot; Hammond also collaborated with Elliot Aronow of Jacques-Elliott for a collection of ties in 2015.

== Personal life ==

Hammond married Polish restaurateur Justyna Sroka on December 23, 2013, with whom he has a daughter, Holiday, born in 2021. 

Hammond previously owned homes in the Nolita neighborhood of Manhattan and in New York&#x27;s Catskill Mountains; in the late 2000s, he built his recording studio, One Way Studios, near his home in Port Jervis and later moved to the nearby community of Eldred. In the 2000s, he had relationships with British supermodel Agyness Deyn, as well as American musician Catherine Pierce of The Pierces.

In the 2000s, Hammond suffered from a serious drug addiction that involved cocaine, heroin and ketamine, among other drugs. He entered rehab in 2009 and has been sober since.

<text>Gloria Frances Stuart (born Gloria Stewart; July 4, 1910 – September 26, 2010) was an American actress, visual artist, and activist. She was known for her roles in pre-code films, and garnered renewed fame late in life for her portrayal of Rose Dawson Calvert in James Cameron&#x27;s epic romance &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Her performance in the film won her a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture.

A native of Santa Monica, California, Stuart began acting while in high school. After attending the University of California, Berkeley, she embarked on a career in theater, performing in local productions and summer stock in Los Angeles and New York City. She signed a film contract with Universal Pictures in 1932, and acted in numerous films for the studio, including the horror films &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932) and &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933), followed by roles in the Shirley Temple musicals &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot; (1936) and &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (1938). She also starred as Queen Anne of Austria in the musical comedy &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1939).

Beginning in 1940, Stuart slowed her film career, instead performing in regional theater in New England. In 1945, following a tenure as a contract player for Twentieth Century Fox, Stuart abandoned her acting career and shifted to a career as an artist, working as a fine printer and making paintings, serigraphy, miniature books, Bonsai, and découpage for the next three decades. She produced numerous pieces during this period, many of which are part of collections in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Stuart gradually returned to acting in the late 1970s, appearing in several bit parts, including in Richard Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982) and &quot;Wildcats&quot; (1986). She made a prominent return to mainstream cinema at age 86 when she was cast as the 100-year-old elder Rose Dawson Calvert in &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997), which earned her numerous accolades and renewed attention. Her final film performance was in Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Land of Plenty&quot; (2004).

In addition to her acting and art careers, Stuart was a lifelong environmental and political activist, who served as a co-founding member of the Screen Actors Guild and the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League.

== Biography ==
===1910–1929: Early life===
Stuart was born Gloria Stewart at 11:00 p.m. on the Fourth of July, 1910 on the family&#x27;s kitchen table in Santa Monica, California, the first child of Alice (née Deidrick) and Frank Stewart. Through her mother, Stuart was a third-generation Californian; Stuart&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Alice Vaughan, was born in 1854 in Angels Camp, gold country, two years after her own mother, Berilla (Stuart&#x27;s great-grandmother), relocated to California from Missouri in a covered wagon. Stuart&#x27;s father, a native of The Dalles, Oregon, was of Scottish descent, and studied law in San Francisco. At the time of her birth, he was an attorney representing The Six Companies. Stuart had one younger brother, Frank Jr., born eleven months later. Another younger brother Thomas (born two years after Frank Jr.); however, he died due to spinal meningitis at age three.

As a child, Stuart attended a Church of Christ with her mother, and subsequently attended a Catholic school. Her father, originally a Presbyterian, converted to Christian Science during her childhood. When Stuart was nine years old, her father died as the result of an infection from an injury sustained when an automobile grazed his leg. She was also expelled from grade school after kicking her teacher (&quot;to be honest, she deserved it&quot; she recalled). Hard-pressed to support two small children, her mother soon accepted the proposal of local businessman Fred J. Finch.

Stuart attended her schooling using the name Gloria Fae Finch. She had not been given a middle name by her parents and so adopted one, Frances, the feminine of Frank, her father&#x27;s name.

Stuart attended Santa Monica High School, where she was active in theater and performed the lead role in her senior class play, &quot;The Swan&quot;. She loved writing as much as acting and spent her last two summers in high school taking short story and poetry writing classes and working as a cub reporter for the &quot;Santa Monica Outlook&quot;.

While a teenager, she had a tumultuous relationship with her stepfather and sought to attend college in order to leave home. After high school, Stuart enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, majoring in philosophy and drama. In college, she appeared in plays, worked on the &quot;Daily Californian&quot;, contributed to the campus literary journal, &quot;Occident&quot;, and posed as an artist&#x27;s model. It was at Berkeley that she began signing her name Gloria &quot;Stuart&quot;.

While a student at UC Berkeley, Stuart wanted to join the Young Communist League. She wrote, &quot;I was told it was for the poor and the oppressed. That appealed to me. But membership wasn&#x27;t open to anyone under eighteen, so I couldn&#x27;t join.&quot; In Carmel, she notes that her friendship with muckraker Lincoln Steffens gave her &quot;... much deeper insight into the abuses of laborers and blue-collar workers and made me ready to work for liberal causes when I got to Hollywood a few years later.&quot;

At the end of her junior year, in June 1930, Stuart married Blair Gordon Newell, a young sculptor who apprenticed with Ralph Stackpole on the facade of the San Francisco Stock Exchange building. The Newells moved to Carmel-by-the-Sea where there was a stimulating community of artists such as Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Robinson Jeffers and Lincoln Steffens and his wife Ella Winter. In Carmel-by-the-Sea, Stuart performed in productions at the Theatre of the Golden Bough and worked as a staff member on &quot;The Carmelite&quot; newspaper. She meanwhile made hand-sewn aprons, patchwork pillows and tea linens, and created bouquets of dried flowers for a tea shop, in which she also worked as a waitress. Newell laid brick, chopped and stacked wood, taught sculpture and woodworking, and managed a miniature golf course. They lived in a shack in the middle of a wood yard as night watchmen. Stuart would later reflect on this period of her life as &quot;wonderfully bohemian.&quot;

===1930–1934: Theatre and early films===
Stuart&#x27;s performance in the theatre in Carmel brought her to the attention of Gilmor Brown&#x27;s private theater, The Playbox, in Pasadena. She was invited there to appear as Masha in Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot;. Opening night, casting directors from Paramount and Universal were in the audience. Both came backstage to arrange a screen test, both studios claimed her. Finally the studios flipped a coin and Universal won the toss. Stuart considered herself a serious actress in theater, but she and Newell &quot;were stony broke, living hand to mouth&quot; so she decided to sign the contract with Universal, which paid a bit more than Paramount.

According to Stuart, she began her film career by playing an ingénue confronting her father&#x27;s mistress in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Street of Women&quot;, a Pre-Code fallen-women film for which she was loaned by Universal. Stuart&#x27;s second film, again playing an ingénue, was in the football-hero film, &quot;The All-American&quot;.

In early December 1932, the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers announced that Gloria Stuart was one of fifteen new movie actresses &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot;—she was a WAMPAS Baby Star. Ginger Rogers, Mary Carlisle, Eleanor Holm were among the others. Stuart&#x27;s career advanced when English director James Whale chose her for his film &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; (1932), playing the glamour role of a sentimental wife who winds up stranded among strangers at a spooky mansion, among the ensemble cast (Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Raymond Massey). The film was critically praised, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Stuart&#x27;s performance &quot;clever and charming,&quot; with the movie later becoming a cult classic. Stuart&#x27;s experience filming &quot;The Old Dark House&quot; also became integral to the formation of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933:


After filming completed, Stuart began canvassing for supporters; she became one of the union&#x27;s first founding members. In June 1936, she helped Paul Muni, Franchot Tone, Ernst Lubitsch, and Oscar Hammerstein II form the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League. That same year she and writer Dorothy Parker helped create the League to Support the Spanish Civil War Orphans.

Stuart was given her first co-starring role by director John Ford in her next film, &quot;Air Mail&quot;, playing opposite Pat O&#x27;Brien and Ralph Bellamy. Of her performance in the movie, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Mordaunt Hall wrote: &quot;Gloria Stuart, who does so well in &quot;The Old Dark House&quot;, a picture now at the Rialto, makes the most of the part of the girl ...&quot; That two Gloria Stuart movies were in theaters simultaneously became the rule rather than the exception in her early career. In 1932, her first year, Stuart had four films released, then nine in 1933, six in 1934. In 1935, Stuart was having a baby, so only four movies were released. Six movies followed in 1936. After &quot;Air Mail&quot;, Mordaunt Hall&#x27;s notices for Gloria Stuart came down to a few words. &quot;Laughter in Hell&quot;: &quot;Gloria Stuart appears as Lorraine ...&quot;; &quot;Sweepings&quot;: &quot;... played by the comely Gloria Stuart ...&quot;; &quot;Private Jones&quot;: &quot;Gloria Stuart is charming ...&quot;
James Whale called Stuart back for just one scene in &quot;The Kiss Before the Mirror&quot;, but the critic Hall wrote, &quot;There are those who may think that it is too bad to introduce as one of the players the dainty Gloria Stuart and have her killed off in the first episode of the narrative. Perhaps it is, but a pretty girl was needed for the part and Mr. Whale obviously did not wish to weaken his production by casting an incompetent actress or an unattractive one for this minor role.&quot;

After good notices in &quot;The Girl in 419&quot;, (Mordaunt Hall mentions &quot;... the pleasing acting of the attractive Gloria Stuart), and &quot;Secret of the Blue Room&quot; (&quot;Miss Stuart gives a pleasing performance.&quot;), James Whale cast Stuart opposite Claude Rains in &quot;The Invisible Man&quot; (1933). Rains was a celebrated import from the London stage, and this was his first Hollywood film. (Mordaunt Hall&#x27;s review of Stuart&#x27;s work was a temperate, &quot;Miss Stuart also does well by her role.&quot;) After having appeared in several of Whale&#x27;s films, Stuart became friends with him and his partner, David Lewis.

Stuart&#x27;s husband, Gordon Newell, was unhappy with Hollywood life. He and Stuart separated amicably and divorced. In 1933 (on the set of her film &quot;Roman Scandals&quot;, a comedy starring Eddie Cantor), Stuart met Arthur Sheekman, one of the movie&#x27;s writers. They were &quot;instantly attracted to each other&quot;. Stuart and Sheekman married in August 1934.

In 1934, Universal loaned-out Stuart to Warner Brothers for &quot;Here Comes the Navy&quot;. Stuart co-starred with James Cagney and Pat O&#x27;Brien, the first of nine films featuring this male team. Frank S. Nugent wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Supporting Mr. Cagney--and doing very creditable jobs, too--are Pat O&#x27;Brien, Gloria Stuart ...&quot;

===1935–1939: 20th Century Fox===

In 1935, Stuart was cast as Dick Powell&#x27;s love interest in Busby Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Gold Diggers of 1935&quot;. It was a musical. Stuart did not dance or sing due to being pregnant, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic commented: &quot;Nor has Gloria Stuart anything of vast import to contribute in the position usually occupied by Ruby Keeler.&quot;

Stuart&#x27;s daughter, Sylvia named after Princess Sylvia, Stuart&#x27;s character in &quot;Roman Scandals&quot; was born in June 1935.

In that same year, Stuart left Universal and joined Twentieth Century-Fox. Her first assignment from studio head Darryl F. Zanuck was in &quot;Professional Soldier&quot;, supporting child star Freddie Bartholomew and Victor McLaglen (who, the year before, had won a Best Actor Oscar for his role in &quot;The Informer&quot;). Frank S. Nugent noted: &quot;There is a minor romance along the way between Gloria Stuart, the king&#x27;s noble governess, and Michael Whalen, the professional soldier&#x27;s part-time assistant, but no one should take it seriously.&quot; In 1936, John Ford chose Stuart to co-star with Warner Baxter in &quot;The Prisoner of Shark Island&quot;. Playing the wife of the doctor who treated Lincoln&#x27;s assassin, Stuart felt privileged to work again with Ford, although &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Frank S. Nugent wrote of Stuart&#x27;s &quot;... helpful performance ...&quot; In &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, Stuart again was asked to support a child star — this time Shirley Temple. Frank S. Nugent: &quot;Listing [Temple&#x27;s] supporting players hastily, then, before we forget them entirely, we might mention Miss Faye [and] Gloria Stuart ... as having been permitted a scene or two while Miss Temple was out freshening her costume.&quot;
For the rest of 1936 and through 1937, Zanuck placed Stuart in movies such as &quot;The Girl on the Front Page&quot;—Frank S. Nugent&#x27;s note: &quot;Call it mediocre and extend your sympathies to the cast ...&quot; Reviewing &quot;Girl Overboard&quot;, Nugent begins, &quot;In the definitive words of the currently popular threnode featured by a frog-voiced radio singer, Universal&#x27;s &#x27;Girl Overboard&#x27; ... is &#x27;nuthin&#x27; but a nuthin&#x27;,&#x27; and a Class B nuthin&#x27; at that.&quot; In spite of the films&#x27; lukewarm reviews, Stuart had amassed a loyal following of fans by this time in her career, one of whom had her portrait tattooed across his chest. Stuart met with the fan and was photographed with him for a &quot;Life&quot; magazine profile in the fall of 1937.
Stuart later appeared in &quot;The Lady Escapes&quot;, &quot;Life Begins in College&quot; and &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, which did not merit space in &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ movie pages. In 1938, Zanuck again insisted Stuart support Shirley Temple in &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot; (1938). In their review of the film, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Shirley Temple proves she&#x27;s a great little artist in this one. The rest of it is synthetic and disappointing ... More fitting title would be Rebecca of Radio City.&quot; In 1938, for the fourth time, Stuart was a supporting player to a child star: Jane Withers in &quot;Keep Smiling&quot;. Stuart but not her performance is noted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; review.

In &quot;Time Out for Murder&quot;, Stuart&#x27;s reviewer said she was &quot;... a pretty bill collector&quot;. Then in 1939, the last year in this phase of Stuart&#x27;s career, in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, Stuart&#x27;s billing came after Don Ameche, The Ritz Brothers and Binnie Barnes and again Stuart&#x27;s work was not reviewed. In &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, the &quot;Times&quot; critic wrote, &quot;... the only thing worth seeing in the picture is Tony Martin trying to play a prizefighter. This is positively killing.&quot; &quot;It Could Happen to You&quot;, &quot;a quasi-comedy&quot; co-starring Stuart Erwin, finished the eight years. Again Stuart is not mentioned.

What did give the actress space in the movie pages the previous November was the story: &quot;Gloria Stuart Quits Fox ... Gloria Stuart has terminated her contract with Fox ...&quot; In fact, Darryl Zanuck did not renew Stuart&#x27;s contract.

===1940–1944: Departure from Hollywood===

Early in 1939, Stuart and then-husband Sheekman spent four months traveling in Asia, Egypt and Italy, then landed in France just as France and the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. They appealed to the American consul, asking to stay, Sheekman as a war correspondent, Stuart as a hospital volunteer. The consul refused help and told them they had to return to the United States. They caught the SS &quot;President Adams&quot;, the last American passenger ship to cross the Atlantic, and arrived in New York City in September.

In New York, Stuart sought to return to stage acting, hoping to star on Broadway. &quot;I wanted to be a theater actress,&quot; she said, &quot;but I thought it would be easier to get to New York and the theater if I had a name than if I just walked the streets as a little girl from California. When I went back to New York with somewhat of a name, they didn&#x27;t want movie actresses.&quot; Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast and performed in various productions between 1940 and 1942, including &quot;Man and Superman&quot;, &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, &quot;The Night of January 16th&quot;, &quot;Accent on Youth&quot;, &quot;Mr. and Mrs. North&quot;, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;, and &quot;Sailor Beware!&quot;. In August 1940, she starred as Emily Webb, opposite Thornton Wilder—under Wilder&#x27;s own direction—in his play &quot;Our Town&quot;, which was staged at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

To help with the war effort in the 1940s, Stuart took singing and dancing lessons; then the USO teamed her with actress Hillary Brooke. The two blonde actresses toured the country, visited hospitals, danced with servicemen in canteens, sold war bonds. Stuart &quot;wanted terribly to volunteer for service overseas with the USO, but Arthur wouldn&#x27;t hear of it.&quot;

On September 16, 1942, Stuart voiced one of the lead rôles, (Claire Winton), in the Suspense (radio drama), episode, &#x27;The Kettler Method&#x27;.

Stuart asked her former agents to get her work. Her first movie in four years, &quot;Here Comes Elmer&quot; (1943), was a comedy with music starring Roy Rogers&#x27; wife, Dale Evans. In &quot;The Whistler&quot; (1944)—an early directing credit of the horror specialist, William Castle—Stuart co-starred with Richard Dix. In her following film, &quot;Enemy of Women&quot; (1944), a war-themed drama, Stuart was seventh in billing. Two years later, Stuart took one more role: she wore a redhead&#x27;s wig in &quot;She Wrote the Book&quot; a comedy starring Joan Davis and Jack Oakie.

===1945–1974: Art career===

After abandoning her acting career in 1945, Stuart went to New York with husband Sheekman—Paramount sent him to see the new play &quot;Dream Girl&quot;, wanting him to adapt it for to screen. A friend took Stuart to the studio of a découpage artist. Drawn to the art form, Stuart thought it could replace acting in her life. With Sheekman&#x27;s encouragement, she opened a shop on Los Angeles&#x27;s decorators&#x27; row, named it Décor, Ltd. Stuart created découpaged lamps, mirrors, tables, chests and other one of a kind &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;. Over the next four years, her work gained attention, and her pieces were carried by Lord &amp; Taylor in New York, Neiman Marcus in Dallas, Bullock&#x27;s in Pasadena and Gump&#x27;s in San Francisco. But in time, labor involved in &quot;the fine fine cutting, applying sixteen coats of lacquer&quot; to every piece and other costs proved prohibitive, and Stuart closed her shop.

After living in rented spaces for ten years, Stuart and Sheekman bought an old craftsman-style house, where she redesigned the interior, supervised the remodeling, designed all the furniture and had it custom made. In the garden, she planned the landscaping, included a green house for orchids and lath house for grafting fruit trees, spent hours on her knees cultivating and planting. In Stuart&#x27;s words, &quot;I became a whirling dervish of creative renovation.&quot;
Early in 1954, visiting Paris, Stuart first saw the Impressionist paintings at the &quot;Jeu de Paume&quot; museum. As when she first saw découpage, Stuart wanted to do it, too. The Sheekmans were on their way to Italy. At the time, American artists living abroad for at least eighteen months paid no taxes on income earned during the residency. Sheekman was now very successful. In the eight years since returning from New York, he had been on fourteen movies, mostly writing the screenplays. He wanted to try another play. For the next eighteen months, Stuart painted and Sheekman worked on his play.

Sheekman&#x27;s comedy about a sorrowful comic, &quot;The Joker&quot;, had Tommy Noonan for its star and was booked into The Playhouse Theater in New York to open April 5, 1957. On April 1, it was announced the play was terminating a pre-Broadway tour of three-and-one-half weeks in Washington, D.C., and was &quot;taken off for repairs.&quot; Repairs were never made. Then after seven years of working at her easel every day, Stuart was ready to show her paintings. In September 1961, Victor Hammer gave Stuart a debut one-woman show at his Hammer Galleries in New York. Nearly all of her forty canvases sold. In the following years, Stuart exhibited her primitive-style paintings in many shows, including at the Bianchini Gallery in New York, the Simon Patrich Galleries and The Egg and the Eye in Los Angeles, the Galerie du Jonelle in Palm Springs and the Staircase Gallery in Beverly Hills. Stuart&#x27;s paintings are in numerous private collections and the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of New Mexico (Santa Fe), the Desert Museum of Palm Springs and the Belhaven Museum (Jackson, Mississippi).

Stuart had been painting for nearly thirty years when, as she wrote, &quot;... the challenges to me of painting as a primitive had been wearing a little thin, and I had become fascinated by the complex art form of serigraphy—silk screening.&quot; Stuart studied with serigrapher Evelyn Johnson, then created vivid serigraphs that are also in private collections.
In the late 1960s, Stuart embraced another art form, the art of bonsai. She took classes from Frank Nagata, colleague of John Naka, a bonsai master in Los Angeles, joined Nagata&#x27;s bonsai club, Baiko-En, and became one of the first Anglo members of the California Bonsai Society. Eventually Stuart&#x27;s collection numbered over one hundred miniature trees.

===1975–1995: Return to acting; book design===
In 1975, after nearly thirty years out of the business, Stuart decided to return to acting. She got an agent and was immediately cast in a small role as a customer in a store in the ABC television film &quot;The Legend of Lizzie Borden&quot; starring Elizabeth Montgomery. From there, through her agent, Stuart was able to get cast in bit parts, mostly in television— including guest appearances on series such as &quot;The Waltons&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. Her friend, director Nancy Malone, gave her a leading role in &quot;Merlene of the Movies&quot;, a quirky film for television, and other friends gave her parts in their shows. In 1982 came &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;. Although Stuart&#x27;s scene lasted moments and she had no lines, she was dancing with Peter O&#x27;Toole. She wrote, &quot;It was a great privilege to work with him.&quot; After that, Stuart was in Jack Lemmon&#x27;s drama &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; and Goldie Hawn&#x27;s comedy &quot;Wildcats&quot;, then more bits and pieces in television. A vintage publicity photo of her was also used for the image of &#x27;Peg&#x27;, the sister of butler Alfred Pennyworth, in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;.

Stuart&#x27;s husband Arthur Sheekman died in January 1978. Five years later, Ward Ritchie, a close friend of Stuart&#x27;s first husband, Gordon Newell, sent Stuart one of his books. Ritchie had become a celebrated printer, book designer and printing historian. With his commercial Ward Ritchie Press and private Laguna Verde Imprenta press, Ritchie produced distinguished books on the arts, poetry, cookery and the American West. Stuart invited him to dinner, and they fell in love. Ritchie was seventy-eight and Stuart seventy-two. When Stuart first followed Ritchie into his studio and watched him pull a printed page from his 1839 English iron Albion hand press, she wanted to do it, too. After studying typesetting at the Women&#x27;s Workshop in Los Angeles, Stuart bought her own hand press, a Vandercook SP15 and established her own private press, Imprenta Glorias. In 1984, Stuart was diagnosed with breast cancer, but successfully treated the disease with a lumpectomy followed by radiation.

In the late-1980s, Stuart began experimenting with making Artist&#x27;s books. She designed several, wrote the text (often poetry), set the type—carefully selecting the style of type to match the subject—printed the pages, then decorated the pages with water colors, silk screen, découpage or all three. She created large artist&#x27;s books and books in miniature. Several of her books took her years to complete. One of them, completed in 1996 with artist Don Bachardy, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Through Ritchie, Stuart was introduced to prestigious librarians and bibliophiles from San Francisco to Paris. Imprenta Glorias books can be found in the &quot;Bibliothèque nationale de France&quot;, the Huntington Library, J. Paul Getty Museum, the Library of Congress, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, the New York Public Library, the Occidental College Library, the Princeton University library, the UCLA Clark Library, the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as private collections. Stuart and Ritchie were together for thirteen years until his death from pancreatic cancer in 1996.

===1996–1998: &quot;Titanic&quot;; career resurgence===
In May 1996, Stuart received a message about a film role: &quot;A female voice said she was calling from Lightstorm Entertainment ... about a movie to be shot on location, maybe Poland ... about the &quot;Titanic&quot;, directed by James Cameron ...&quot; The next afternoon, Cameron&#x27;s casting director, Mali Finn, came to Stuart&#x27;s house &quot;... with her assistant, Emily Schweber, who was carrying a video camera ... Mali and I talked while Emily filmed us.&quot; The next morning, Finn brought over James Cameron and &quot;his&quot; video camera. Stuart wrote, &quot;I was not the least bit nervous. I knew I would read Old Rose with the sympathy and tenderness that Cameron had intended ...&quot; Five days after Stuart&#x27;s eighty-sixth birthday, Finn phoned again and asked, &quot;Gloria, how would you like to be Old Rose?&quot;

Most of Stuart&#x27;s filming was completed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, over about three weeks in early summer of 1996. Stuart also filmed and made recordings for several documentaries, did more looping and dubbing for Cameron, and received offers for additional films. Stuart wrote: &quot;On April 7, 1997, the publicity blitz for &quot;Titanic&quot; kicked off...  From that point on, the deluge of publicity never stopped.&quot; On December 17, 1997, Stuart was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film. She was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She was one of the few Golden Age stars to attend the ceremony, with contemporaries Fay Wray, Bob Hope, and Milton Berle also attending. As of 2022, she remains the oldest nominee in the category. Stuart later parodied her role in a music video for the Hanson song &quot;River&quot; alongside &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic who also directed the video.

On March 8, 1998, the Screen Actors Guild awarded Stuart its Founders Award, and also won the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role, tying with Kim Basinger (&quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;). For both awards, Stuart received a standing ovation from her peers.

The following May, &quot;People&quot; magazine included Stuart on their list of &quot;The 50 most beautiful people in the World in 1998.&quot; Also in May, Stuart was guest of honor at the Great Steamboat Race between the Belle of Louisville and the Delta Queen and then was Grand Marshal of the 1998 Kentucky Derby Festival&#x27;s Pegasus Parade.

Next, Stuart signed a contract with Little, Brown and Company to write her autobiography, &quot;I Just Kept Hoping&quot;. Stuart made her debut at The Hollywood Bowl on July 19, 1998, reading the poem, &quot;Standing Stone&quot;, Paul McCartney&#x27;s oratorio for orchestra and chorus.

===1999–2010: Final years and accolades===

Stuart was asked by the producer and star, Kate Capshaw, to join her cast of &quot;The Love Letter&quot; (1999), which she filmed in Rockport, Massachusetts. In October 1999, Stuart&#x27;s native Santa Monica issued a Commendation signed by the mayor recognizing Gloria Stuart &quot;... for many contributions world-wide and her inspirational message to always keep hoping. Dated this 16th day of October, 1999. Pam O&#x27;Connor, Mayor.&quot; In September 2000, Stuart unveiled her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in front of the Pig &#x27;n Whistle café that had opened its doors in 1927 when Stuart was still in high school. She also made guest appearances on several television series, including the 2000 science fiction series &quot;The Invisible Man&quot;; &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Although she was once again reduced to minor roles, Stuart&#x27;s last two movies were for director Wim Wenders. In 1999, she worked on &quot;The Million Dollar Hotel&quot; in downtown Los Angeles. In 2004, she appeared in Wenders&#x27; &quot;Land of Plenty&quot;, her final film.

In 2006, Stuart donated her screen printing equipment to Mills College, where an exhibition of her work was held. On June 19, 2010, despite her illness, Stuart appeared in person to be honored by the Screen Actors Guild for her years of service. At a luncheon, she was presented the Ralph Morgan Award by &quot;Titanic&quot; co-star Frances Fisher. James Cameron and Shirley MacLaine were among the luncheon attendees. On July 22, 2010, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored Stuart&#x27;s career with a program featuring film clips and conversations between Stuart and film historian Leonard Maltin, portrait artist Don Bachardy and David S. Zeidberg, the Avery Director of the Huntington Library. One thousand people filled the Samuel Goldwyn Theater.

From the time Stuart was announced in the &quot;Titanic&quot; cast, she appeared before the camera for interviews on subjects as diverse as Groucho Marx, Shirley Temple, James Whale, horror movies and friends Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy.

Stuart was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 94, many decades after she had quit smoking. Until that point, she had enjoyed remarkably good health for her advanced age aside from taking cortisone shots for knee pain. She underwent radiation treatment, but in time the cancer returned and she underwent a shorter course of radiation. The malignancy continued to spread, but slowly due to her age. She died six years after her initial diagnosis and reached her centenary.

Stuart celebrated her 100th birthday on July 4, 2010, hosted by James Cameron and Suzy Amis as well as family and friends at the ACE Gallery in Beverly Hills. There Stuart saw many of her paintings and serigraphs, artist&#x27;s books, samples of her découpage and trees from her bonsai collection exhibited in the gallery.

== Culinary interest ==

Stuart was a skilled amateur chef and hosted frequent dinner parties in Hollywood. She was close friends with the American food writer M.F.K. Fisher, who was godmother to Stuart&#x27;s daughter Sylvia Vaughn Thompson. Thompson later wrote about Stuart&#x27;s cooking style: &quot;My mother has never made Just Roast Beef in her life. It wouldn&#x27;t interest her. Her style is based on the intricacies of composition. It borders on the baroque. Everyone adores it.&quot;

After tasting Stuart&#x27;s goose in Kirschwasser aspic, the writer Samuel Hoffenstein composed a poem, which he comically said was inspired by &quot;hearing the wings of all the poets brush thro&#x27; Gloria&#x27;s kitchen.&quot;

Stuart&#x27;s mother Alice was also an avid cook, producing specialties from the San Joaquin Valley, where Stuart&#x27;s mother&#x27;s family lived for generations.

==Activism and politics==
Stuart was a lifelong Democrat. She was a co-founding member of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, which formed in 1936. In 1938, as a member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee, Stuart was on the executive board of the California State Democratic Committee. She was also an avid environmentalist. &quot;I belong to every organization that has to do with saving the environment,&quot; said Stuart. &quot;I&#x27;m fed up with venal and avaricious forestry people, mining people, oil people, gas people. I think the abuse of the environment is sinful.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Stuart died from respiratory failure at her home in Los Angeles on September 26, 2010, at age 100. Her body was cremated. At the time of her death, she had four grandchildren and twelve great-grandchildren.

Stuart&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Deborah B. Thompson, produced an e-book, &quot;Butterfly Summers: A Memoir of Gloria Stuart&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;.

For her contributions to the film industry, Stuart has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It is located on the 6700 block of Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Allium oleraceum, the field garlic, is a Eurasian species of wild onion. It is a bulbous perennial that grows wild in dry places, reaching in height. It reproduces by seed, bulbs and by the production of small bulblets in the flower head (similarly to &quot;Allium vineale&quot;). Unlike &quot;A. vineale&quot;, it is very rare with &quot;A. oleraceum&quot; to find flower-heads containing bulbils only. In addition, the spathe in &quot;A. oleraceum&quot; is in two parts.

Its specific epithet &quot;oleraceum&quot; means &quot;vegetable/herbal&quot; in Latin and is a form of ().

==Description==
&quot;Allium oleraceum&quot; grows to a height of about . The underground bulb is up to in diameter. The main stem is usually rounded, but is occasionally flattened, and bears two to four leaves and a terminal inflorescence composed of a number of small, stalked, pinkish-brown flowers and sometimes a few bulblets. The papery bracts have long points which often much overtop the flowers, the stamens of which do not protrude.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Allium oleraceum&quot; is widespread across most of Europe, with additional populations in Turkey and the Caucasus. It is sparingly naturalised in scattered locations in North America.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;A. oleraceum&quot; is found in dry, grassy places, usually steeply sloping and calcareous soils, and on open sunny banks in river floodplains. &quot;A. oleraceum&quot; is scattered throughout England and very scattered in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Erosion of coastal areas leads to a reduction in the available habitat for this species, leading to population declines. The highest altitude from which it has been recorded in Britain is in Dovedale, Derbyshire.

&quot;Allium oleraceum&quot; subsp. &quot;girerdii&quot; was formerly included, but is now classified as &quot;Allium oporinanthum&quot;.

<text>Zhaozhou Congshen (; ; 778–897) was a Chán (Zen) Buddhist master who appears frequently in the koans of the Mumonkan and the Blue Cliff Record.

==Biography==
Zhaozhou became ordained as a monk at an early age. At the age of 18, he met Nánquán Pǔyuàn (南泉普願 748–835; J: Nansen Fugan), a successor of Mǎzǔ Dàoyī (709–788; J. Baso Do-itsu), and eventually received the Dharma from him. Zhaozhou continued to practice under Nanquan until the latter&#x27;s death.

Subsequently, Zhaozhou began to travel throughout China, visiting the prominent Chan masters of the time before finally, at the age of eighty, settling in Guānyīnyuàn (觀音院), a ruined temple in northern China. There, for the next forty years, he taught a small group of monks. This temple, now called Bailin Temple, was rebuilt after the Cultural Revolution and is nowadays again a prominent center of Chinese Buddhism.

==Influence==
Zhaozhou is sometimes touted as the greatest Chan master of Tang dynasty China during a time when its hegemony was disintegrating as more and more regional military governors (&quot;jiédùshǐ&quot;) began to assert their power. Zhaozhou&#x27;s lineage died out quickly due to the many wars and frequent purges of Buddhism in China at the time, and cannot be documented beyond the year 1000.

Zhaozhou is remembered for his verbal inventiveness and sense of humor. One of his recorded sayings is:

Many koans in both the &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; and &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot; concern Zhaozhou, with twelve cases in the former and five in the latter being attributed to him. Mumonkan case (koan) 19 records a dialogue between Nanquan and Zhaozhou, with Jōshū asking Nansen &quot;What is the Way [&quot;Tao&quot;]?&quot;, to which Nansen responds ordinary mind is the way, a famous dictum of Mazu Daoyi (709–788) and the Hongzhou school. He is probably best known for the first koan in &quot;The Gateless Gate&quot;:
Japanese Zen monk Shunryū Suzuki refers to Zhaozhou (as Jōshū) in his book Zen Mind, Beginner&#x27;s mind. He uses the following saying from Zhaozhou to illustrate the point that Zen practice should not have a particular purpose or goal: &quot;A clay Buddha cannot cross water; a bronze Buddha cannot get through a furnace; a wooden Buddha cannot get through fire&quot;.

<text>The half-month is a calendar subdivision used in astronomy. Each calendar month is separated into two parts:
*days 1 to 15
*day 16 until the end of the month.
Newly identified small Solar System bodies, such as comets and asteroids, are given systematic designations that contain the half-month encoded as a letter of the English alphabet. For example, an object discovered in the second half of January would be identified with the letter B; if found in the first half of February, the letter would be C. The letter I is not used, to prevent confusion with the number 1. Instead, the letters proceed directly from H (April 16–30) to J (May 1–15). The letter appears in the provisional designation, then when the object is confirmed the letter is incorporated into the comet designation (for comets) or minor planet designation (for asteroids and other minor planets).

<doc id="528426" wikidata="Q1123613" url="?curid=528426" title="Schuko">
<text>Schuko () or type F, is a connector (plug/socket) system used in much (but not all) of Europe. It is a registered trademark referring to a system of AC power plugs and sockets that is defined as &quot;CEE7/3&quot; (sockets) and &quot;CEE7/4&quot; (plugs). A Schuko plug features two round pins of diameter ( long, centres apart) for the line and neutral contacts, plus two flat contact areas on the top and bottom side of the plug for protective earth (ground). The socket (which is often, in error, also referred to as CEE7/4) has a predominantly circular recess which is deep with two symmetrical round apertures and two earthing clips on the sides of the socket positioned to ensure that the earth is always engaged before live pin contact is made. Schuko plugs and sockets are symmetric AC connectors. They can be mated in two ways, therefore line can be connected to either pin of the appliance plug. As with most types of European sockets, Schuko sockets can accept Europlugs. Schuko plugs are considered a very safe design when used with Schuko sockets, but they can also mate with other sockets to give an unsafe result.
 is a shortening of the German term &quot;&quot; (literally: protective contact), which indicates that plug and socket are equipped with protective-earth contacts (in the form of clips rather than pins). Schuko connectors are normally used on circuits with , , for currents up to , although e.g. South Korea uses them at for historical reasons.

==History==

The Schuko system originated in Germany. It is believed to date from 1925 and is attributed to Albert Büttner, a Bavarian manufacturer of electrical accessories. Büttner&#x27;s company, , was granted patent DE 489003 in 1930 for a (&#x27;plug with earthing device&#x27;). Büttner&#x27;s patent DE 370538 is often quoted as referring to Schuko, but it actually refers to a method of holding together all of the parts of a plug or socket with a single screw which also provides clamping for the wires; there is no mention of an earth connection in DE 370538. At this time Germany used a centre tap giving 127 V from current pins to earth, which meant that fuse links were required in both sides of the appliance and double pole switches. Variations of the original Schuko plug are used today in more than 40 countries, including most of Continental Europe.

France, Belgium, Czechia, Slovakia and Poland use the CEE7/6 plug and CEE7/5 socket (Type E) with the same size and spacing of the main pins but with a male protective-earth pin on the socket instead of the earth clips, and without the guiding notches at the sides. Most modern moulded Schuko plugs, and good-quality rewirable replacements, are a hybrid version (&quot;CEE;7/7&quot;) with an aperture that accommodates the earth pin of CEE7/5 sockets. CEE7/6 plugs that need to be polarised are configured in such a way as to only be inserted correctly in earthed sockets, however the old CEE7/1 2-pin unearthed socket is inherently dangerous with equipment that should be polarised, for example table lamps with an Edison screw lamp but only a single pole inline cord switch in lieu of a double pole switch. The safety of polarisation was not helped by several years of confusion when the correct connection of sockets was transposed.

Early in the 21st century, CEE7/7 became the &quot;de facto&quot; plug standard in many European countries, and in some other countries that follow CENELEC standards. European countries that do not use CEE7/7 are:
*Denmark (CEE7/17 and Danish standard 107-2-D1 are widely used, they accept CEE7/7 plugs but without compatibility for earth connections. CEE7/5 and CEE7/3 sockets with child-proof shutters have been allowed since 2008/2011, but are uncommon in buildings constructed before these dates).
*Ireland (BS1363 – equivalent Irish Standard: IS401) but see below,
*Italy (CEI23-50 – includes Schuko),
*Malta (BS1363),
*Cyprus (BS1363),
*The United Kingdom, including Gibraltar (BS1363)
*Switzerland (SN441011)

In Italy, CEI 23-50 is the dominant standard and it also includes Schuko sockets (P30 = CEE7/3) and plugs (S30 = CEE7/4, S31 = CEE7/7, S32 = CEE7/17). Appliances are commonly sold with Schuko-type plugs (as well as Europlugs), while Italian-type plugs have become rare today and almost only power strips, cable reels and adaptors are sold with them. Some sockets (P30 and P40) accept both types, the remainder accepting one or the other. Schuko sockets are most commonly used for larger-rated appliances such as washing machines, and are particularly common in South Tyrol, with its cultural, economic and tourist connections with Austria.

Although Schuko has never been a standard (or the de facto norm) in Belgium or France, it is sometimes encountered in older installations in eastern regions of Belgium and Alsace.

In Ireland, Schuko was commonly installed until the 1960s. For safety reasons and to harmonize with the UK and thereby avoid having a different outlet type in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the Republic standardized on BS 1363 (transposed into Irish Standards as IS401 (Plug) and IS411 (Socket outlet). Schuko has been phased out of use in Ireland and will be rarely encountered. Some hotels provide a Schuko outlet alongside BS1363 outlets for the convenience of visitors from the Continent.

Russia, while maintaining its own mains connector standard, has it largely harmonised with the relevant European regulations since Soviet times. The original Soviet standard was mostly compatible with Europlug (the traditional Soviet plug used straight pins with spacing and thus Soviet sockets were able to easily accept europlugs), and has been modified to accept pins, due to the large volume of imported appliances equipped with the Schuko plug. Nowadays most sold and installed sockets in Russia are Schuko ones, though they may lack a connection to earth, especially in older buildings, as this wasn&#x27;t required by the Soviet wiring regulations.

Denmark gave full permission to install Schuko wall sockets in 2011, and such sockets can be found for sale at some Danish constructionware stores, but the Danish Type K remains the most common earthed socket type in Denmark by far.

==Safety features==
CEE 7/3 refers to sockets, CEE 7/4 to plugs.

When inserted into the socket, the Schuko plug covers the socket cavity(1), thereby preventing users from touching connected pins. It also establishes protective-earth connection through the earth clips(2)&quot;before&quot; the line and neutral pins(3)establish contact. A pair of non-conductive guiding notches(4)on the left and right side provides extra stability, enabling the safe use of large and heavy plugs (e.g. with built-in transformers or timers).

Some countries, including Portugal, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Italy require child-proof socket shutters; the German DIN 49440-1:2006-01 standard does not have this requirement.
==Compatibility with other plug/socket types==
Schuko sockets can accept two-pin unearthed Europlug (CEE7/16) and CEE7/17. Less safely, Schuko plugs can be inserted into many two-pin unearthed CEE7/1 sockets and into some sockets with a different form of earth connection that will not mate with the earth contacts on the Schuko plug (e.g., some variants of the Danish socket). Many such sockets also lack the cavity required to prevent users from touching the pins whilst inserting the plug.

The CEE 7/7 plug is a hybrid which includes both side earthing strips, as in CEE7/4 Schuko, and an earthing aperture, as in the CEE7/6 plug. It can therefore achieve an earth contact with both CEE7/3 (Schuko) and CEE7/5 sockets.

In Italy, Chile, Peru and Uruguay, hybrid versions of Schuko sockets (called P30) are seen with an extra hole that will take the smaller variant of Italian CEI23-50 plugs. There are also hybrid Schuko sockets (called P40) with three extra holes and a wider cavity that will also accept the larger variant of Italian plugs.

Schuko sockets are unpolarised; there is no way of differentiating between the two live contacts (line which is approximately to earth and neutral which is approximately to earth) unless the voltage to earth is measured prior to use.

Although Schuko is incompatible and the pin spacing should not allow it, as the Schuko pins are slightly closer together, it is possible to dangerously force many Schuko round pin plugs (where the plastic is compliant enough) into many UK BS 1363 rectangular pin sockets, using a match or other probe to push into the earth shutter release. Due to the minimal contact area that must transmit high current, there is risk of overheating and thus fire. Where earthing is required, no earth contact will be made as Schuko plugs use side contacts for earthing rather than a third pin, and BS 1363 sockets have shutters that require the longer earth pin to be entered to open the line and neutral shutters, which prevent Europlugs and Schuko plugs from being inserted.

The IEC 60906-1 standard was intended to address some of the issues regarding polarisation and replace Schuko, but the only countries that have adopted it are South Africa and Brazil.

<doc id="528427" wikidata="Q1008459" url="?curid=528427" title="Gaspard de la nuit">
<text>Gaspard de la nuit (subtitled &quot;Trois poèmes pour piano d&#x27;après Aloysius Bertrand&quot;), M. 55 is a suite of piano pieces by Maurice Ravel, written in 1908. It has three movements, each based on a poem or &quot;fantaisie&quot; from the collection &quot;Gaspard de la Nuit – Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot&quot; completed in 1836 by Aloysius Bertrand. The work was premiered in Paris, on January 9, 1909, by Ricardo Viñes. Ravel dedicated the piece to pianist Harold Bauer.

The piece is famous for its difficulty, partly because Ravel intended the Scarbo movement to be more difficult than Balakirev&#x27;s &quot;Islamey&quot;. Because of its technical challenges and profound musical structure, Scarbo is considered one of the most difficult solo piano pieces in the standard repertoire.

The manuscript currently resides in the Harry Ransom Center of the University of Texas at Austin.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Gaspard&quot; is derived from its original Persian form, denoting &quot;the man in charge of the royal treasures&quot;: &quot;Gaspard of the Night&quot; or the treasurer of the night thus creates allusions to someone in charge of all that is jewel-like, dark, mysterious, perhaps even morose.

Of the work, Ravel himself said: &quot;Gaspard has been a devil in coming, but that is only logical since it was he who is the author of the poems. My ambition is to say with notes what a poet expresses with words.&quot;

Aloysius Bertrand, author of &quot;Gaspard de la Nuit&quot; (1842), introduces his collection by attributing them to a mysterious old man met in a park in Dijon, who lent him the book. When he goes in search of M. Gaspard to return the volume, he asks, &quot; &#x27;Tell me where M. Gaspard de la Nuit may be found.&#x27; &#x27;He is in hell, provided that he isn&#x27;t somewhere else&#x27;, comes the reply. &#x27;Ah! I am beginning to understand! What! Gaspard de la Nuit must be...?&#x27; the poet continues. &#x27;Ah! Yes... the devil!&#x27; his informant responds. &#x27;Thank you, &quot;&quot;!... If Gaspard de la Nuit is in hell, may he roast there. I shall publish his book.

==Structure==

===I. Ondine===
Written in C major and based on the poem &quot;Ondine&quot;, an oneiric tale of the water nymph Undine singing to seduce the observer into visiting her kingdom deep at the bottom of a lake. It is reminiscent of Ravel&#x27;s early piano piece, the &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; (1901), with the sounds of water falling and flowing, woven with cascades.

There are five main melodies. The opening melody at bar 2 evokes a line of song and is similar in form and subject to the main theme in Sirènes from Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot;. This is interrupted by the second theme at bar 10 before opening up a longer melodic passage formed from the latter part of theme 1. Then a short simple melody first heard at bar 23 introduces shimmering harmonic side-shifting. The final distinct melody is a menacing short rising figure first heard at bar 45, which prefaces the menace of Le Gibet and which later provides a bridge to the main climax at bar 66. Ravel prioritises melodic development to express the poetic themes, keeping subordinate the simmering coloration of the right hand. By contrast, Claude Debussy&#x27;s works such as &quot;Reflets dans l&#x27;eau&quot; tend to treat melody more equally with harmonic and figurative impulsivity, and often position virtuosity more in the foreground.

This piece contains technical challenges for the right hand such as the fast repetition of three-note chords in the opening accompaniment, the double note passages beginning at bar 57, and the disjunct climactic movement of the hands beginning at bar 66.

The duration of Ondine is about 6:30. Recordings vary in tempo, driven perhaps by the tension of keeping the shimmering alternating notes from becoming mechanical, yet giving sufficient space for the lyricism of the melodies.

===II. Le Gibet===
Written in E minor and based on the poem of the same name, the movement presents the observer with a view of the desert, where the lone corpse of a hanged man on a gibbet stands out against the horizon, reddened by the setting sun. Meanwhile, a bell tolls from inside the walls of a far-off city, creating the deathly atmosphere that surrounds the observer. Throughout the entire piece is a B octave ostinato, imitative of the tolling bell pattern in the Funeral March of Chopin&#x27;s second piano sonata. It remains constant in tone as the notes cross over and dynamics change. The duration of Le Gibet is around 6 minutes.

===III. Scarbo===

Written in G minor and based on the poem &quot;Scarbo&quot;, this movement depicts the nighttime mischief of a small fiend or goblin, making , flitting in and out of the darkness, disappearing and suddenly reappearing. Its uneven flight, hitting and scratching against the walls and bed curtains, casting a growing shadow in the moonlight creates a nightmarish scene for the observer lying in his bed.

With its repeated notes and two terrifying climaxes, this is the high point in technical difficulty of all the three movements. Technical challenges include repeated notes in both hands, and double-note scales in major seconds in the right hand. Ravel reportedly said about Scarbo: &quot;I wanted to write an orchestral transcription for the piano.&quot; The duration of Scarbo is around 9 minutes.

==Orchestral versions==
&quot;Gaspard de la Nuit&quot; was orchestrated by Eugene Goossens in 1942, and by Marius Constant in 1990.

<text>Thomas L. Saaty (July 18, 1926 – August 14, 2017) was a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Pittsburgh, where he taught in the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business. He is the inventor, architect, and primary theoretician of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a decision-making framework used for large-scale, multiparty, multi-criteria decision analysis, and of the Analytic Network Process (ANP), its generalization to decisions with dependence and feedback. Later on, he generalized the mathematics of the ANP to the Neural Network Process (NNP) with application to neural firing and synthesis but none of them gain such popularity as AHP.

He died on the 14th of August 2017 after a year-long battle with cancer.

Prior to coming to the University of Pittsburgh, Saaty was professor of statistics and operations research at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania (1969–79). Before that, he spent fifteen years working for U.S. government agencies and for companies doing government-sponsored research. His employers at that time included the Operations Evaluation Group of MIT at the Pentagon, the Office of Naval Research, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency at the U.S. State Department.

==Contributions==
Saaty was a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He has made contributions in the fields of operations research (parametric linear programming, epidemics and the spread of biological agents, queuing theory, and behavioral mathematics as it relates to operations), arms control and disarmament, and urban design. He has written more than 35 books and 350 papers on mathematics, operations research, and decision making. Their subjects include graph theory and its applications, nonlinear mathematics, analytical planning, and game theory and conflict resolution. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, he has had 14 doctoral students. Saaty himself was a student of Einar Hille at Yale.

In line with his long-time interest in peace and conflict resolution, in 1983 Saaty proposed that an International Center for Conflict Resolution needs to be established that would have branches in many countries and would be staffed by retired diplomats, negotiators and conflict analysts. This idea was first published in an article &quot;Center for Conflict Resolution,&quot; in the March 1984 issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and it later appeared as an appendix in his 1989 book on Conflict Resolution co-authored with J.M. Alexander. A current revised version of this proposal is posted here with his University of Pittsburgh vita.

A 2002 article listing the most important contributions to operations research from 1954 to date listed four from Saaty: &quot;Parametric Programming&quot; (1954, with S. I. Gass), &quot;Mathematical Methods of Operations Research&quot; (1959), &quot;Elements of Queueing Theory&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Analytic Hierarchy Process&quot; (1980). The book on operations research was the first to summarize the formal mathematical methods in the field of Operations Research and was translated to Russian and Japanese. The comprehensive work on queueing theory was reviewed by D.G. Kendall of Oxford University in Mathematical Reviews who wrote that this book is &quot;a substantial encyclopedia of queueing theory whose scope is indicated by the 910 items in the bibliography at the end of the book.&quot; The book &quot;Mathematical Methods of Arms Control and Disarmament&quot; was reviewed in Management Science in April 1969, &quot;This fascinating book is an important contribution to the present task of discovering some valid underlying mathematical structures in politics...highly recommended both because of its numerous fascinating models and because of the deadly importance of its subject.&quot; The Analytic Hierarchy Process itself anticipates the PageRank algorithm by more than 20 years, with the same basic idea of using the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a suitable matrix.

Saaty has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering (2005), and the &quot;Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales&quot; (Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences, 1971). In 1973, he received the Lester R. Ford Award from the Mathematical Association of America for expository excellence in his paper &quot;Thirteen Colorful Variations on Guthrie&#x27;s Four-color Conjecture&quot; on the four color problem, and in 2000 he was awarded the gold medal of the International Society on Multi-criteria Decision Making. He is the 2007 recipient of the Akao Prize of the QFD Institute. In 2008, he received the INFORMS Impact Prize for his development of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The Impact Prize is awarded every two years to recognize contributions that have had a broad impact on the fields of operations research and the management sciences. Emphasis is placed on the breadth of the impact of an idea or body of research. In 2011 he was awarded, in a , the Doktor Honoris Causa degree by Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland. In December 2011 he received the Herbert Simon Award for Outstanding Contribution in Information Technology and Decision Making for the paper &quot;The Possibility Of Group Welfare Functions&quot; coauthored with Professor Luis G. Vargas, published in the International Journal of Information Technology &amp; Decision Making (IJITDM), Most of the university scholars are working on the basis he provided, Anum Bakhtyar.

Saaty died at the age of 91 on August 14, 2017, 14 months after a cancer diagnosis.

==Early life==
Selick was born on November 30, 1952 in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, the son of Melanie (née Molan) and Charles H. Selick. He was raised in Rumson. Selick did little but draw from ages 3 to 12. His fascination with animation came at a young age, when he saw Lotte Reiniger&#x27;s stop-motion film &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; and the animated creatures of &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; by Ray Harryhausen. He graduated from Rumson-Fair Haven High School in 1970.

After studying science at Rutgers University in New Brunswick and art at Syracuse University and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London, Selick eventually enrolled at the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) to study animation. He studied at the Program in Experimental Animation at California Institute of the Arts under the guidance of Jules Engel. His two student films there, &quot;Phases&quot; and &quot;Tube Tales&quot;, were nominated for Student Academy Awards.

Selick worked on commercials, including working on the stop-motion animation for the Pillsbury Doughboy for some of the Pillsbury Company commercials.

==Film work==

===Disney===
After his academic studies, he went to work for Walt Disney Studios as an &quot;in-betweener&quot; and animator trainee on such films as &quot;Pete&#x27;s Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Small One&quot;. During his time at Disney, he met and worked around the likes of Rick Heinrichs, Jorgen Klubien, Brad Bird, John Musker, Dan Haskett, Sue and Bill Kroyer, Ed Gombert, Andy Gaskill, and Tim Burton. Burton served as producer on Selick&#x27;s first two films as director, the Disney-produced &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; and &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;. Years later, Selick claimed he learned a lot to improve his drawing, animation, and storytelling skills from Disney legend Eric Larson.

===Further work===
Selick&#x27;s third feature was &quot;Monkeybone&quot;, a live-action/stop-motion adaptation of an underground comic, &quot;Dark Town&quot; by Kaja Blackley, produced by 20th Century Fox. The film was a flop both commercially and critically. Selick later admitted his unhappiness with the final product and has since vowed to never make another live-action film again. Selick, who animated the fictional sea creatures in Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot;, signed on as animation director on Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;. In February 2006, Selick left the project, to work on &quot;Coraline&quot; for Laika. Selick, who kept in contact with Anderson, said the director would act out scenes in &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; while in Paris and send them to the animators via iPhone.

=== &quot;Coraline&quot; (2009) ===
Selick&#x27;s first feature with Laika, LLC was &quot;Coraline&quot;, based on the novella &quot;Coraline&quot; by acclaimed fantasy author Neil Gaiman, and released in 2009. It was the first ever stereoscopic 3D stop-motion animated film. The film received generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;Coraline&quot; was nominated for Best Animated Feature as an Academy Award, a BAFTA, and a Golden Globe.

===Work with Pixar===
Selick left Laika in 2009. In 2010, Selick joined with Pixar and The Walt Disney Company in a long-term contract to exclusively produce stop-motion films. This not only returned Selick to his original roots, but also reunited Selick with numerous former friends and co-animators. His new studio, called Cinderbiter Productions, was self-described as &quot;a new stop motion company whose mandate is to make great, scary films for young &#x27;uns with a small, tight-knit crew who watch each other&#x27;s backs.&quot;

Selick and Cinderbiter&#x27;s first film under this deal, a project called &quot;ShadeMaker&quot;, was set to be released on October 4, 2013. In 2011, the film was green-lit for production and retitled &quot;The Shadow King&quot;. In August 2012, it was reported that, after spending a reported $50 million, Walt Disney Pictures canceled the project, due to &quot;a creative and scheduling standpoint, the pic wasn&#x27;t where it needed to be to meet its planned release date.&quot; Disney gave Selick the option to shop the project to another studio. Selick revealed in 2022 that the film suffered from interference from then-CCO of Pixar John Lasseter, who he claimed came in and constantly changed elements of the script and production that ended up ballooning the budget. Selick said that he had reacquired the rights for &quot;The Shadow King&quot; from Disney and that he may revive the project.

On April 28, 2012, it was announced that Disney had optioned the rights for Neil Gaiman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Graveyard Book&quot;. Later that same day, it was announced that Selick would direct the film after work was completed on &quot;ShadeMaker&quot;. It was unknown if the adaptation would be live-action or stop motion. After the studio and Selick parted ways over scheduling and development, it was announced in January 2013 that Ron Howard would direct the film.

In February 2013, it was reported in a press release by Selick that K5 International would be handling sales for &quot;The Shadow King&quot; at the European Film Market. It was unknown when the film would actually be released. In August 2016, a rep for Selick said the film was &quot;in turnaround again&quot; while Selick continued work on his other two projects: &quot;A Tale Dark and Grimm&quot; and &quot;Wendell and Wild&quot;.

On October 16, 2013, Selick announced a live-action film adaptation of Adam Gidwitz&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;A Tale Dark and Grimm&quot;. As of 2023, no further updates on the project have been given.

===&quot;Wendell &amp; Wild&quot; (2022)===
On November 3, 2015, it was reported that Selick was developing &quot;Wendell &amp; Wild&quot;, a new stop-motion feature with Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key based on an original story by Selick. In 2018, the film was picked up by Netflix. The film was released on October 28, 2022, on Netflix.

===Upcoming projects===
In June 2017, Selick was reported to direct the pilot and subsequent episodes of a &quot;Little Nightmares&quot; TV adaptation produced by the Russo brothers.

In June 2024, it was announced that Selick was developing a stop-motion film adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot;, as well as reviving &quot;The Shadow King&quot; as a graphic novel. In August 2024, Selick implied &quot;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&quot; was back in limbo, saying in an interview while promoting the theatrical re-release of &quot;Coraline&quot;, &quot;I would hope that it might still come together, but I have no predictions.&quot;
